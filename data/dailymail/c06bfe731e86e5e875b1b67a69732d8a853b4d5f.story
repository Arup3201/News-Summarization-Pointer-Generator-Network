Talk about living the high life... These spectacular shots capture the world's bravest men and women walking a tightrope hundreds of feet above the breathtaking Utah desert.

These daredevil thrill-seekers can be seen slowly inching their way across a 120ft wide high-line - risking a 400ft drop to the canyon below.

Explorers travel from all over the globe to take part in the annual slack lining, BASE jumping and climbing festival held in the stunning surroundings of the Utah desert.

And their daring antics are captured by photographer Scott Rogers, 25, who started the event five years ago as a way to get all his friends together who travel during the year.

Scott, from Denver, Colorado, said: 'People are often all over the world doing their thing so it's a place we can all get together and let of steam and have some fun.

'It started out as something really informal with about 20 people at the first event.

'As the years went on we continued to host the event and word-of-mouth, as well as the beautiful pictures we captured every year, helped it to grow in popularity.

'This year was the biggest yet with more than 100 people attending from lots of different countries.

'The festival lasts for 10 days but it takes a good couple of days just to get all the ropes and our equipment set up before we can really have some fun.'

But he admitted that some of the climbers do get injured attempting the risky stunts.

He continued: 'This week started out by rescuing my friend Jill. She jumped and crashed into the wall really badly so we had to carry her down the mountain so a helicopter could fly her to hospital.

'Fortunately she was okay and the rest of us were able to do some really great highlining and BASE jumping during the festival just as I hoped.

'It's just a full on week of absolute shenanigans - it's unbelievable.'

Scott, who has been slacklining for 10 years and BASE jumping for four years, got his first taste of the daring sport at a climbing competition he was competing in.

He was so amazed by it that he forgot to compete and just slacklined all day.

Scott added: 'At the festival, which has taken the name "Turkey Boogie", the community comes together and creates a space where people can do these dangerous things with the help and support of others.

'For an entire week we walk highlines at or above our ability level. We take falls, we get back up, we try again, we walk across.

'The feeling of doing something both physically and mentally difficult is taken to the next level when you have the support of your friends.

'Spending time here is just unbelievable. Everyone becomes great mates and you never know who you might bump into each year.

'I don't think there is anywhere else in the world you can have as much fun.'
