Roger Federer has been getting used to early exits at grand slams but rated his French Open loss to Ernests Gulbis as the most disappointing of the lot.

Having made 36 consecutive slam quarter-finals, Federer has failed to reach the last eight at three of the last four tournaments.

The sequence ended at Wimbledon last summer with his stunning second-round loss to Sergiy Stakhovsky while he was then beaten in the fourth round at the US Open by Tommy Robredo.

In Paris, Federer came out on the wrong end of a five-set battle with Gulbis in round four, losing 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.

'For every match you can't necessarily explain why you lost,' said Federer.

'Sometimes
 you're more disappointed, sometimes less. I'm not mad, but I'm not 
happy, either. Because I missed too many opportunities. I did not play 
like I wanted to play.

'This time I was in good shape, and I think I could have done better. That's why I'm probably even more disappointed this time.'

Gulbis
 appears to have left his playboy reputation behind him, if not his 
penchant for causing controversy, and is finally living up to his 
considerable talent.

From
 outside the top 130 in the rankings at the start of last season, Gulbis
 has climbed to a career-high 17 and is unbeaten in France this year 
having won titles in Marseille and last week in Nice.

He said: 'It's probably the most important win, especially because it was five sets.

'I
 beat him before, but it was a three-set match. So for my confidence and
 just for me as a tennis player, a five-set win over Roger Federer, it's
 really big.'

The lightbulb moment for Gulbis came at a Challenger tournament in Eckental in Germany in November 2012.

'I asked for a wild card,' he said. 'I
 didn't get the wild card. I had to play qualifying. I made the final 
there, so it was an okay week, but it was the end of the year and in the
 middle of nowhere.

'It 
was winter, it was really depressing, and I thought, "I start to do 
something or for what I do this"? So that was one big question. This is 
the answer.'

Gulbis
 probably should have won the opening set but Federer fought back, and 
the outcome might have been very different had the Swiss taken either of
 two set points serving at 5-3 in the second.

On
 the first Gulbis admitted he got lucky as Federer sent a smash right to
 him, but three points later the Latvian had the break back and he went 
on to win the set on a tie-break.

Another key moment came with Federer leading 5-2 in the fourth set.

Gulbis
 went off court for treatment to his back and hamstring and, although 
Federer did take the set, his momentum had gone and a service break at 
the start of the decider ultimately cost him the match.

Federer
 was suspicious Gulbis may have used the break tactically, saying: 'He 
didn't look hurt in any way. But if you can use it, you might as well do
 it.'

Gulbis, though, insisted that was not the case.

'I'm
 not big on medical time-outs,' he said. 'I don't like to take it, but I
 take it when it's really necessary. It probably was my third medical 
time-out in my life.'

The
 crowd willed their favourite Federer on, and Gulbis admitted the 
hostility towards him had curbed the wilder side of his personality - 
not withstanding one broken racquet.

'One is nothing for me,' said the 25-year-old with a grin.

The
 Latvian moves on to play sixth seed Tomas Berdych, who continued his 
impressive progress through the draw with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win over John 
Isner.

Federer will have
 a week to spend with his family before defending his title on grass in 
Halle and then moving on to Wimbledon, where he believes he is a genuine
 title contender.

He said: 'Mentally I have already switched to the grass.

'I
 think when I'm healthy, like I have been now for the last six to nine 
months, I think clearly I can decide the outcome of the matches more 
than I could last year. So I'm very excited about my chances for 
Wimbledon now this time.'
