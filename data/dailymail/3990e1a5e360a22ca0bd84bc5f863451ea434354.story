A 10-year-old girl has been hailed a hero after posting a desperate plea for help on Facebook when her father was crushed by a tree.

Brianna Vance watched in horror as the massive trunk crashed down on her dad Gregory Vance on the porch of their Pecks Mill, West Virginia home during a violent storm on June 10.

With no phone signal, the quick-thinking child posted a video on social media begging viewers to call 911.

'The lightning crashed and hit a tree by
 our porch and my dad’s almost dead,' Brianna said through tears.

'He needs an ambulance 
please. Please call one for us if you have a signal. We live in a yellow
 house, a trailer. Please. We need an ambulance. Please. Please.'

Soon later, emergency crews arrived and rushed Vance to hospital with a broken collar bone and five broken ribs.

Two of Vance's friends who were also crushed were taken to hospital. Vance's partner and children were not injured in the storm.

Henlawson (Logan County) Fire Department Lt. Tim Granger said Brianna’s quick thinking saved her dad's life.

'This is the real hero, that little girl, and I hope she gets recognized for her heroism,' Granger told ABC News.

But for Brianna, the Facebook post seemed like her only option.

'I was scared. I needed help. My dad needed help,' she said. 'So I had to post that.'

Meanwhile, Vance was released from hospital on Saturday night, in time to spend Father's Day with his family.

'If she (Brianna) would have been there a little bit longer and it would have hit her. The pain of burying one of my children, I could not bare that but I can handle this pain,' Vance told WOWKTV.

'I knew they (my children) loved me but it's the love they've shown lately. I mean it's unconditional, it's real.'

Brianna said she was overjoyed to have her dad home safe: 'I'm glad he's home and I love him.'
