A New Jersey woman has filed a lawsuit claiming she's borne the brunt of a dangerous neighbors threats, intimidation and racist remarks.

But instead of her neighbor, Cyndee Phoenix of Hamilton Township is suing the development company who sold her the home in October for 'knowingly concealing' her future neighbor was a 'dangerous individual.'

Phoenix's suit also claims that developer Lennar Corp. directly aggravated the problem by sending Potter a letter that addressed his past behavior and made it look as if Phoenix had complained.

Cyndee Phoenix, 53, accuses the home developer Lennar Corporation of failing to disclose what they knew about her neighbor in a Mays Landing, New Jersey development Kevin Elville Potter

Phoenix claims her bad experience with neighbor Kevin Elville Potter began before she'd even purchased the home, reports Courthouse News Service.

Phoenix works as a community outreach director for a casino in Atlantic City and had just seen a home in nearby Hamilton Township.

While she was mulling over whether or not to buy a home in a Lennar Corp.-owned planned development, Phoenix and a sale representative were approached by Potter.

Potter demanded to know why he was no longer receiving community services such as landscaping.

While the sales rep 'implied that Mr. Potter was no longer eligible (for) services as a result of the time that had passed since his house was purchased,' according to court papers, Phoenix says she learned after she bought the home that Potter was no longer getting services as a result of his 'aggressive, harassing and hostile interactions' with Lennar employees.

Phoenix claims Lennar Corp knowingly concealed her neighbor's dangerous nature from her so that she would purchase the home

Phoenix ended up buying the home and says no sooner had she moved in then Potter began to harass her.

'He's made snide and racist comments, like, "Go back to Atlantic City where you belong" which is a more urban area,' Phoenix's attorney Brett Datto told ABC News. 'He blares his music loudly, takes pictures of my client's guests. He's a problem person.'

The complaint claims Potter directed '"increasingly harassing' behavior toward Phoenix, going to far as to threaten her sister's life.

It also states that during one confrontation, Potter became 'aggressive, hostile and kept mentioning' the letter written to him by Lennar.

Phoenix says she had nothing to do with the letter but now claims it made matters a lot worse for her because Potter believed she was behind it.

Damages? The home was in this Mays Landing, New Jersey housing development. Phoenix is seeking seeking damages for fraud, consumer fraud, misrepresentations and omissions

When she and her sister actually filed harassment complaints against Potter, Phoenix hired a bodyguard to protect them from her angry neighbor and even he became a target.

The lawsuit says Potter 'started to confront the hired security guard by staring at him for long periods of time, calling the police on the security guard and even following the security guard for 15 miles on the Garden State Parkway.'

Phoenix's complaint names Potter but not as a defendant.

Phoenix says she 'is constantly living in fear' and that Lennar 'omitted material information' so that she would purchase the home.

She is seeking damages for fraud, consumer fraud, misrepresentations and omissions, and violations of New Jersey's Planned Real Estate Development Full Disclosure Act.
