Police have arrested a man on two capital murder charges in the fatal shooting of rapper Doe B. and a female college student at an Alabama bar. Six others were also wounded.

Montgomery police said today that 25-year-old Jason Quan McWilliams of Montgomery turned himself the previous evening and that he's being held without bond.

Jail records show he faces two counts of capital murder but don't say whether he has an attorney.

City officials closed the Centennial Bar and Grill after the 22-year-old rapper, whose real name is Glenn Thomas; and Kimberle Johnson, a 22-year-old Troy University student, were fatally shot early Saturday.

Kimberle Johnson was celebrating her 21st birthday inside the Alabama bar at the time of the shooting.

A police statement said the shooting stemmed from a dispute involving the rapper.

The six others wounded were in stable condition over the weekend.

The young daughter of the rapper yesterday lit a candle for her father during an emotion vigil just a few feet from where he died.

Madison Thomas, three, joined dozens of other mourners to lay flowers and light candles at the scene of the bloodbath.

Mr Thomas was a member of superstar
 rapper TI’s Hustle Gang and had come home to celebrate a recent hit 
song.

Ms Johnson was pronounced dead at the scene while Mr Thomas was rushed to a local hospital, police said. He was pronounced dead soon after he arrived.

A third unidentified person is in the
 hospital with ‘life threatening’ injuries, a police spokesperson told 
MailOnline, declining to provide further details.

Centennial
 Bar and Grill, where the shooting occurred, was ordered closed by 
Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange for posing an ‘imminent threat to the 
public's safety,’ according to a published statement.

This
 was the second such attack at the club in the last year. A December 
2012 shooting left six injured at the bar, then-named Rose Supper Club, 
according to WNCF.

The rapper was not performing in the bar when the shooting occurred, according to manager DJ Frank White. This was the second time he had been 
shot, the first attempt on his life resulted in the eye patch he wore 
that became part of his persona.

He had two children and a third on the way when he passed, he also had a promising rap career ahead of him.

Ms Johnson's death comes only four 
years after her father died while serving with the US Army in Iraq, 
according to pictures on her Facebook page.

Of the additional six people shot, only one has serious injuries.
