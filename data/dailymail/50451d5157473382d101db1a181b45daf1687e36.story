Two lawyers representing a woman who
claims to have had sex as a minor with prominent U.S.
criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz have filed a counter-defamation
lawsuit against him.

Former federal judge Paul Cassell and Florida plaintiffs
attorney Bradley Edwards filed the lawsuit in a Florida circuit
court, accusing Dershowitz of initiating a public media assault
on their reputation and character, according to court documents. 

In a filing in Florida federal court last week, Cassell and
Edwards said their client, identified by Buckingham Palace as Virginia Roberts, was forced
as a minor by financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with several
people, including Dershowitz and  Prince Andrew.

Two lawyers representing Virginia Roberts, pictured here with her husband Robert Giuffre in Denver, who claims to have had sex while a minor with prominent U.S.criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, filed a counter-defamation lawsuit against him

On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on the lawyers' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same.

In a sworn statement in a Florida
federal court, he denied he had sex with an underage girl on
Epstein's private plane and island. Buckingham Palace has also
denied the allegations against Prince Andrew.

In their lawsuit, Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz
defamed them when he accused them of 'deliberate misconduct and
unethical behavior warranting disbarment' during several
interviews with U.S. and international media outlets.

On Monday Dershowitz, who was part of O.J. Simpson's 'dream team', filed defamation suits in both London and the U.S. based on Cassell and Edwards' public statements about the case and he urged Prince Andrew to do the same

Controversy: Prince Andrew, pictured here in Verbier, Switzerland, has been linked with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and accused of having sex with Virginia Roberts when she was a minor

Cassell and Edwards said Dershowitz made defamatory
statements in 'reckless disregard' in order to support his claim
of innocence.

'I'm thrilled that they sued me, because this gives me an
opportunity to depose them and prove beyond any doubt that they
concocted the entire story out of whole cloth and that they did
not do a proper investigation and that they have falsely accused
me,' Dershowitz said on Tuesday.

Dershowitz said in Monday's filing that the allegation
against him was a 'deliberate lie.' He said that while he had
flown on Epstein's plane several times, Roberts, named in court papers as Jane Doe #3, was not on
any of those trips. 

Lawyers: Dershowitz slammed his accuser's lawyers, Brad Edwards (left) and Paul Cassell (right), for naming him in the lawsuit. He claims that they failed to carry out proper investigations - which they have denied

Questions: Prince Andrew is photographed with Virginia Roberts in 2001, left, and she is also pictured with her father, right, when she was seven. Roberts accused the prince and Dershowitz of having sex with her

He also said he had been to Epstein's island
once, for a day, and was with his wife and daughter the whole
time.

Also on Monday, Dershowitz filed a motion in federal court
to enter in a lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by his
accuser and other women who say Epstein sexually abused them.

The women say the government's 2008 plea deal with Epstein,
which allowed him to serve jail time on state charges but avoid
federal prosecution, violated their rights.

Dershowitz, a Harvard University professor emeritus,
represented Epstein against the sex crime charges, for which
Epstein served a 13-month sentence after pleading guilty in
2008.
