The Gold Coast's 'Bum Crack Bandit', who made headlines when she flashed her backside during a robbery, has been sentenced to six years jail for shooting a man in a drug deal gone wrong.

Eboni Pydde, 21, made headlines in 2011 when CCTV footage captured a distinctive tattoo on her buttocks as she robbed the Coomera Lodge Hotel late on the night of 27 December 2011.

Pydde and several associates smashed one of the pub's windows with a crowbar to gain entry, before stealing alcohol, cans of Red Bull and a cash pool from the gaming area.

Eboni Pydde was today sentenced to six years in jail for an armed robbery that took place in 2011

Dubbed the 'bum crack bandit', Pydde is serving time for shooting a motorcyclist after she robbed a pub on the Gold Coast

CCTV footage showed Pydde, dressed in a hoodie, thongs, and low-slung jeans vault the bar to retrieve the alcohol, revealing her bum crack and a tattoo in the process.

Crown Prosecutor Brendan Campbell told the Brisbane Supreme Court that while the robbery was taking place a motorcyclist, Luke Norris, arrived at the hotel to take part in a pre-arranged drug deal with one of the other burglars.Â

Mr Campbell said that Mr Norris bought half a gram of speed for $200 before preparing to leave on his bike, when he was shot at, reported The Australian.

Mr Norris told the court that he saw Pydde hanging out the rear window of the car holding a small silver gun.

She wore a hoodie and low-slung jeans during the robbery. The jeans revealed her bum crack and a distinctive tattoo, which police used to help identify her

He was shot three times, hit in the hand and upper arm and sustained fractures to his bones as well as nerve damage, requiring several surgeries.

Pydde was arrested on April 15, 2012.

Her barrister, Damian Walsh, said Pydde was a 'psychologically damaged' young woman who had depression and indicators for PTSD as a result of the sudden death of a family member and a traumatic assault she endured at the age of 16.

Justice David Boddice said Pydde's actions were 'highly dangerous' and malicious and of particular concern because there seemed to be no motive behind the shooting.

Pydde has already served more than a year in jail and Justice Boddice took that into account during sentencing, saying she might be eligible for parole on December 1, after she had served 20 months behind bars.

The woman's brother, Dion, is facing an unrelated murder charge.
