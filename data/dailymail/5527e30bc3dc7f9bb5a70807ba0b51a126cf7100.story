An architect has lovingly built an incredible floating home which is part contemporary box and part warehouse to indulge his love of the water.

Mike Villiot, a retired contractor and his
 son, Matt, spent a year building the house which is located on Lake Union at
 the Northlake Shipyard in Seattle.

The stunning floating home was designed by Dan Nelson of Designs Northwest Architects for Mr Villiot and his wife Kris.

Stunning: It took a year to build the contemporary-meets-wharf-warehouse home in Seattle

The couple gave up a 4,000-square-foot home in North Seattle for life on the water and have lived on the lake since November 2008.

They describe themselves as ‘water people’ who love nothing more than messing around on the lake.

They reveal that they welcomed the change in lifestyle that their ‘impulse’ buy of a slip gave them.

‘The boys were gone and we both were working and doing a bad job of taking care of our house,’ Mrs Villiot told The Seattle Times.

'We went to some open houses. This was an impulse buy,' he added.

Their incredible one of a kind house on a dock holds eight newer homes that sit behind a locked gate.

But its unusual exterior tends to attract a good deal of gawping and stares from passers-by who are always keen to take a closer look.

‘It’s a lot less private in summer’ Mrs Villiot said. ‘But we’re used to waving at boaters.’

What a view! The living room opens completely onto Lake Union with two automatic garage doors

Bedroom: The guest bedroom is open to its surrounding dockside views and anchored in walls of bookshelves

Lake Union home: The spiral staircase winds up to the rooftop deck complete with a putting green, the exterior of the home is Trespa (a plastic-laminate composite) vertically banded with Western red cedar battens, which gives it that crate-like effect  says architect Dan Nelson

The Villiott’s floating home has two bedrooms, 2½ baths and is under 2,000 square feet and sits on a float of Styrofoam surrounded by concrete.

The quirky, modern design by Nelson combines the look of a warehouse along the wharf, with a wooden look and a rugged exterior.

The house features a signature external metal spiral staircase and a 30-by-40-foot rooftop patio with a fair(way)-sized putting green.

The main living spaces are at water level with two garage doors to remove separation from living room and lake.

The second floor has a master suite, laundry, den and a guest room.

Spectacular: The kitchen is earthy and active with vertically placed (and perfectly matched) zebrawood cabinets crafted by Jonathan Pauls in Georgetown, the counter, also a dining table for eight, is granite outlined in steel

Bathroom: Tiny glass tiles lining the walls of the main-floor powder room cast a shimmer much like the sun glinting off the lake on a bright day

Hallway: A large skylight drives light through the home. The painting on the left is by Cathy Schoenberg of Guemes Island

Porthole: Open stairs to the private spaces keep the eye moving through the main living area and a porthole windows over the desk are a natural for life on the lake

The interior was created by Susan Broll of Susan Broll Interior Design who worked in warm colours.

The pair say that they enjoy the surrounding community.

Their home is within walking distance of Capitol Hill, downtown and the Seattle Center.

When the weather warms up they enjoy the lake itself which is suitable for a nice dip.
