It's fair to assume David Beckham owns a host of match-worn shirts handed to him by some of football's biggest stars following a 20-year playing career but it seems son Brooklyn is starting a collection of his own.

Beckham Jnr attended Chelsea's Champions League clash against his father's former side Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night and managed to get his hands on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's shirt.

Posting an image of the jersey to his Instagram account, the 16-year-old said: 'Thanks Zlatan Ibrahimovic for the shirt. And well played.'

The PSG frontman was dismissed in the first-half for a challenge on Chelsea midfielder Oscar. However, despite being down to 10 men for the majority of the match, Laurent Blanc's side progressed to the Champions League quarter-finals as Thiago Silva's extra-time goal sealed a 2-2 draw and sent the French side through on away goals.Â 

It seems Brooklyn was supporting the Ligue 1 side and will have been pleased with the result on Wednesday night, posting an image of the match unfolding at Stamford Bridge with the caption: 'PSG, PSG, PSG, PSG'.

Brooklyn, looking to follow in his father's footsteps as a  footballer, played for Arsenal's youth side this year but has missed out on the offer of a professional contract.
