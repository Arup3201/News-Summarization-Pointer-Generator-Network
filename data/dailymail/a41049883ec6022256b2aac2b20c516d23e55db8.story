A cheating wife has been sentenced to life in prison after recruiting two men she met in a bar to murder her wealthy husband to get his £1million fortune.

Charlotte Collinge, 45, took two men back to the £400,000 house she shared with her husband Clifford Collinge, 17 years her senior, with the promise of sex.

As they approached the detached property, she told the pair - Stephen Shreeves, 40, and 27-year-old Kelvin Dale - that she 'hated' her husband, and asked if they knew anyone that could kill him.

Once there, the men launched a savage attack on the 61-year-old retired newsagent which left him with 46 separate injuries.

Collinge, who was out of the house at 
the time buying cocaine, returned to the house in Mansfield, 
Nottinghamshire, to find her husband lying in a pool of blood - but 
stepped over his body instead of calling an ambulance.

Help was only summoned half-an-hour later by a worried friend of 44-year-old Collinge who she had spoken to on the phone.

Prosecutors said that if there had not been a delay in dialling 999, Mr Collinge may have survived.

Following a four-week trial, a jury of
 five women and seven men found Collinge, Shreeves and Dale guilty of Mr
 Collinge’s murder.

Collinge was today jailed for a 
minimum of 23 years, while Stephen Shreeves, 40, and Kelvin Dale, 27, 
were each jailed for 18 years.

Sentencing the trio at Nottingham 
Crown Court, the judge, His Honour Mr Justice Colman Treacy, said: 'The 
killing of Clifford Collinge in his own home was a truly shocking 
offence.

'On the evidence I have heard, I’m 
satisfied he was a man who offered no harm to any of you and who indeed 
had, over a number of years, tolerated the wilful and manipulative 
behaviour of an unfaithful wife.'

Judge Mr Justice Treacy told Collinge 
she was the 'instigator' of the attack, which took place in the village 
of Warsop last October.

He added: 'You caused the killing for your own selfish reasons.

'There is evidence to show that for a 
period of time prior to his death, you wanted the prompt termination of 
the life of your husband. I am sure a factor in motivation was gain for 
yourself.'

During the trial, prosecutor Peter 
Joyce QC told the court that the couple, who had been together for 17 
years in total, had a rocky relationship peppered with break-ups and 
reconciliations, and divorce had been discussed.

The trial heard that on the day of the
 killing Collinge, who had a string of lovers, told a close friend: "I 
can't take any more of him.

'I've had enough of Cliff. The only way to get him out of my life is to kill him.'

Hours later she started flirting with strangers Shreeves and Dale in a wine bar and persuaded them to return home with her.

When police arrived at the scene after the attack, Collinge was heard to say: 'Oh God, I think I have killed him.'

But she quickly claimed she had no 
idea Mr Collinge was going to be attacked, and had returned to find him 
lying injured. She told jurors she failed to call an ambulance because 
she was 'in shock'.

In the weeks leading up to the killing, Collinge had moved out of the marital home to live with a 21-year-old 'toy boy'.

Jurors were told that despite her 
unfaithfulness, Mr Collinge continued to send his wife money and allowed
 her to return home after she claimed her younger lover had beaten her 
up.

But just a week before his death, 
Collinge had talked of killing her husband with sleeping pills and 
making his death look like an accident.

Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, told the 
jury: 'The deceased was a man of some wealth. Friends of the couple 
thought that Charlotte Collinge was using the deceased.

'She would speak openly about gaining 
access to his home and money, stating: 'I'll have that house. I will use
 any means whatsoever to get it'.'

The court heard that in the event of 
Mr Collinge passing away, his estate would be split between his wife and
 two children, Julie Bowles, 34, by his first marriage, and Cristal, 16,
 who was his daughter with Collinge.

Collinge would have got the £400,000 
marital home, a cash payment of £250,000, all of his belongings and half
 of future rents from other properties he owned. The total would have 
been around £1million.

Jailed: Collinge was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court for a minimum of 23 years while Shreeves and Dale were both sentenced to 18 years

In a statement read to the court after
 the verdicts, Cristal, who now lives with her boyfriend's family, said 
her father was 'generous and caring'.

She added: 'My dad meant everything to me. We went everywhere together.

'He was the best kind of father anyone
 could have. If I had problems he would always be there for me. He 
called me 'Princess'. He was my hero.'

Following the sentencing today, Mr Collinge's daughter, Julie Bowles, said outside court: 'We are truly devastated that we will never again see our dear old dad smile, and that he will miss out on watching his beloved grandchildren grow up.To have a child ask why their grandad had to die and not know the answer myself is beyond words.

'Forty-six injuries in his own home. We are in complete shock and disbelief that this has happened to our dad.

'The knowledge that our father was forced to suffer in the way he did, as arranged by someone whom, against all the advice from his friends, he supported for so long, is an unspeakable burden of knowledge to now have to carry through our lives.'I believe Shreeves and Dale were caught up in the premeditated actions of Charlotte. But they, along with her, must now face the consequences.'

Steve Gad, a friend of Mr Collinge's, 
said: 'Cliff loved her right until the very end. He loved her to pieces.
 It was his undoing.

'She took the life of a loving father.
 Quite callously and absolutely, deliberately, with no thought for 
anyone else except herself.

'Her only motive was financial gain. She obviously didn't love him - because she was telling everyone she didn't love him.'

Speaking outside the court, Temporary Superintendent Kate Meynell, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'I think the sentences today would reflect the severity of the attack on Clifford Collinge.

'It was a horrible attack, it was planned by his wife and she recruited two men earlier in the evening to carry out the attack and they've received the justice that they deserved.

'Charlotte Collinge has come across as an extremely cold and calculating woman. She obviously took Clifford Collinge for all she could get. He was besotted with her and she took advantage of that and carried on doing that until she killed him.

'It's our belief and the prosecution case that she did this to try and get money. She wanted a divorce, she wanted access to his house, he didn't want to sell the house and she thought this was the only way to get what she wanted.'
