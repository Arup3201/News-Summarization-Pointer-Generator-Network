Inter Milan are ready to offer Stevan Jovetic an escape route out of Manchester City.

It is understood that Inter have made contact with representatives of the Montenegro star, who looks likely to leave the Etihad at the end of the season after being axed from City’s Champions League squad to accommodate new £28million signing Wilfried Bony.

The Premier League champions were prepared to listen to offers for Jovetic amid interest from Juventus in January if they could have recouped the £22m he cost from Fiorentina in 2013, after rejecting several bids by Inter to take him back to Serie A last summer.

Inter Milan are interested in signing Jovetic with Roberto Mancini reluctant to make Lukas Podolski's loan deal from Arsenal permanent

With former City boss Roberto Mancini reluctant to turn Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski’s loan into a permanent move, Inter have maintained a strong interest in signing Jovetic.

The 25-year-old forward spoke of his disappointment last month after manager Manuel Pellegrini replaced him with Bony in his squad for the knockout stage of the Champions League.

‘The manager has killed me with this decision,’ said Jovetic. ‘I have not made any decision about my future. I will wait until the summer then we will see.’

Meanwhile, Matija Nastasic’s appearance for Schalke in Tuesday’s Champions League tie against Real Madrid has triggered a clause in the City defender’s loan to the German club that will make the move permanent at the end of the season.
