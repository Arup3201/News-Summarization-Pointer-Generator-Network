If you're due an upgrade and can't decide which handset to get, Apple will now offer you a financial incentive to switch to its iPhone.

The Californian tech giant has extended its recycling and trade-in scheme to include rival handsets from the likes of Samsung, HTC and BlackBerry.

A typical, working Samsung Galaxy S5 is worth £144 in Apple Store credit, while a two-year-old HTC One can be sold for £54. 

Apple has extended it recycling and trade-in scheme to include rival handsets from the likes of Sony, Samsung, HTC, Nokia , LG and BlackBerry (pictured). The Apple trade-ins are available in the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany and Italy and prices will vary in each region

By comparison, the same phones sold to Mazuma Mobile are worth £174 and £65 respectively, and this increases to £191.40 and £71.50 if users choose to take an Argos voucher. 

An iPhone 5S sold to Apple is worth £170 of store credit, but £195 from Mazuma. 

The Apple trade-ins are reportedly available in the US, UK, Canada, France, Germany and Italy but the option is not currently visible on each of these stores yet. 

In the UK, handsets include Sony, Samsung, Nokia, LG, HTC and BlackBerry but this will vary depending on the country, as will prices.

They can be made in either an Apple Store, where an employee will assess the handset's condition and offer a price, or the handsets can be recycled online.

The latest smartphone sales data from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech show that Apple’s share of sales grew across the US, Europe and China during the fourth quarter of 2014.

In the US, Apple iOS overtook Android for the first time since 2012 albeit by 0.1%. 

Across Europe, Android’s share declined by 3.8% year-on-year to 66.1 per cent while iOS rose by 6.2%.

The UK had the biggest impact on the decline as iOS grew its share by  13.1% compared to this time last year with Samsung, LG and Sony all losing market share year-on-year.

The online price quoted will depend on the working condition and this will be verified by the company when the handset is received for processing.

The price quoted is then given to the customer in the form of a gift card or store credit. 

Rumours that this scheme was being extended first appeared on fan site 9to5Mac. 

Apple launched its iPhone Reuse and Recycle trade-in scheme in 2013. 

It lets people take old handsets into a store and get credit to put towards the purchase of a new one.

Apple also offers an iPad version of the scheme.
