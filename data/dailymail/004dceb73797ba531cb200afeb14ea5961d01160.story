Arsene Wenger expects Chelsea to take a tumble at some stage but he’s far less convinced that Diego Costa’s much-discussed hamstrings will creak under the strain.

It was put to Wenger that Jose Mourinho might be applying a smokescreen in his regular comments about the allegedly fragile hamstrings of his striker.

Arsenal’s manager smiled at the suggestions before today’s clash at Stamford Bridge, saying: ‘Honestly, when you see him play it is not obvious (that he has an injury).

‘He has had a problem with his hamstring for a long time and we saw that in the Champions League final but when I have seen him recently, it is difficult to guess that he has a hamstring problem.’

With a ratio of eight Premier League goals in six games, it’s certainly possible to share that conclusion. 

The 25-year-old’s impact appears to have made up for Chelsea’s striking shortcomings from last season, with Wenger admitting they are favourites for the title though he raised questions over their staying power.

He said: ‘They are one of the favourites. They have had the perfect start and have the best numbers until now. On Sunday they are the favourites. But every team had its difficulties at some stage in the season.’

Despite Chelsea’s fine start, and Wenger’s woeful record against Mourinho, the Frenchman insisted he would not alter his tactics for the match.

‘We have to adapt a little bit but let’s be honest, any single player at Chelsea can make a difference,’ Wenger  said.

‘If you mark Costa, Eden Hazard could score. Or Willian. Or Oscar.

‘It is always difficult to find balance and adapt to opponents strengths without restricting your own expression.’
