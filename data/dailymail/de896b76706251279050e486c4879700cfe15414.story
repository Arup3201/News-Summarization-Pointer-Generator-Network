Two daredevils trying to scale a dangerous rock face in Yosemite National Park without climbing gear are due to reach the end of their 3,000ft journey tonight.

Tommy Caldwell, 36, and Kevin Jorgeson, 30, have been working their way up the sheer face of El Capitan since December 27 - and their only concession to modern climbing techniques are ropes to catch them should they fall.

They started climbing the final 11 sections - known as pitches - on the rock face Tuesday night, and are expected to close on the summit by Wednesday evening, a spokesman said.

Unaided: Kevin Jorgeson (pictured) and Tommy Caldwell have been heaving themselves up El Capitan by their fingertips since December 27. Ropes are attached to stop them falling - but they have no climbing aids to get them up the rock face

Struggle: The men have spent weeks climbing the California peak, which has only razor-thing ledges to grip which have eviscerated their hands 

Struggle: The two men have been climbing the El Capitan rock face for some three weeks now. Pictured above is Kevin Jorgeson on January 9 reaching for one of the Dawn Wall formation's many sharp, narrow ledges

Triumph: Jorgeson is pictured here after finishing a particularly grueling segment of the dangerous wall. Neither he nor partner Tommy Caldwell use climbing aids to scale the mountain - but both are attached by ropes to save them should they slip

Home for now: The men are sleeping in tents pegged to the face of El Capitan and ascend every day to where they left off

Their endeavor will be the first ever 'free climb' the segment known as Dawn Wall. 

The two men, who sleep in tents pegged to the side of the rock face, have struggled for days to reach the final stretch.

Jorgeson has recently started out again after tearing the skin from his hands on El Capitan's razor-sharp ledges, which forced him to spend two days resting so he could heal.

On Tuesday night the spokesman said: 'We will update you on their progress this evening as best we can, but it is likely that they will finish up the climb tomorrow evening.'

The men often start climbing at dusk, because the heat of the day can make their hands sweaty and slippery. Both of them have been training for more than five years to make their bid for the summit.

The climbers have been keeping their fans updated intermittently on social media.

Earlier this week, after finally finishing a segment from which he had fallen 11 times in seven days, making no progress, Jorgeson said: 'Momentum is a powerful force. When it's on your side, everything feels a bit easier. When it's not on your side, it feels like wading through mud.

'For 7 days, my momentum was halted by Pitch 15. It took everything in my power to stay positive and resolved that I would succeed.

Long way down: Caldwell, pictured examining his sore hands, has been climbing with his buddy since December 27

Sheer wall: The rock face offers little in the way of support, and what ledges there are can slice up the hands of the climbers

'Now that momentum has returned to my side, I'm staying just as focused and resolved because a lot of hard climbing remains.'

The day before Caldwell, who had made faster progress than his climbing mate, posted in support of Jorgeson.

He said: 'Today Kevin managed to climb pitch 15 in the most inspired climbing moment of his life.

'It was such an intense and incredible thing to witness. It's not over yet, but things are looking good.
