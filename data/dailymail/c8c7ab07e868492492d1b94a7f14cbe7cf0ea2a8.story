Six American troops have been killed in a helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan, officials say.

The service members, who have no been identified, were aboard a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter when it went down Tuesday in Zabul province.

Officials say there were no reports of fighting or insurgent activity in the area at the time of the crash.

Investigators are looking into whether the aircraft malfunctioned.

The International Security Assistance Force announced the deaths of six NATO service members on Tuesday morning, but did not release their nationality.

NBC News reports that American officials have confirmed the dead were all from the United States.

Deputy governor of southern Zabul province, Mohammad Jan Rasoolyar, says a NATO helicopter crashed in the remote district of Shajau.

So far this year, 119 Americans have died in Afghanistan - one third as many as were killed in the country last year.

In September, two Navy sailors died when their MH-60 Knighthawk helicopter crashed while attempting to land on an American destroyer in the Red Sea.

In August 2011, 38 people were killed including 30 Americans and 15 members of the elite Navy SEAL Team Six when the Taliban shot down a CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter in Wardak province.

There are currently about 60,000 U.S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan and 24,000 more from other NATO nations.

By 2015, just 10,000 American troops will be left in the country.
