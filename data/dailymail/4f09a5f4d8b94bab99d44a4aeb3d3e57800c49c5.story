Cristiano Ronaldo is always hungry for success and his new look resembles Hannibal Lecter more than a current Ballon d'Or winner.

The forward, always hungry for success, posted an Instagram photo of him relaxing with what appears to be a facial mask during his summer holidays.

The Portugal captain is currently 
enjoying a break from football, having led his country in a disappointing 
World Cup campaign in Brazil last month.

Dr Hannibal Lecter is the fictional villain and cannibal most famously played by Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of The Lambs (below).

Paulo Bento's side failed to qualify from Group G - with the Iberian nation finishing behind tournament winners Germany and USA.

Away from the pitch, Ronaldo's four-year-old son still has no idea who his mother is, and his family have no intention of telling him.

Ronaldo's sister, Elma, revealed that Cristiano Jnr, sometimes known as Cristianinho, has stopped asking about his mum, after they told him she was dead.

The Real Madrid star, 29, had the child with an unknown woman, believed to be a surrogate, in 2010.

Elma said: 'Once we told him she was in Heaven, but my brother and mum asked us not to repeat it.

'We say now his mum went traveling. He goes silent, forgets about at and doesn't ask anymore.'

Cristianinho
 lives with Ronaldo and the star's mum Dolores in Spain. She has recently 
released an official biography in which she said that the footballer 
insisted: The mum will never be known'.

However, Elma added: 'If later on 
Cristianinho wants to know who his biological mum is, it will be his 
decision and no one’s going to stop it.'
