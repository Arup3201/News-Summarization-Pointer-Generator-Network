A woman whose life was changed forever after a 'love doctor' mutilated her genitals is writing a book about her ordeal and the doctor she trusted to perform the routine procedure.

Cheryl Sexton Dillon, from Ohio, was happily married with three children when she was 36-years-old.  But her happiness was ruined when Dr James C. Burt recommended she get a hysterectomy when all she needed was minor bladder surgery.

What followed was not just a hysterectomy, but a nine-hour operation in which her genitalia was totally mutilated - with her vagina relocated and her clitoral hood removed.

Speaking to ABC about the 1984 procedure, she said: 'I thought I would die. The pain was unlike anything I had ever experienced in places I couldn't understand.

Trauma: Cheryl Dillon did not just get a hysterectomy, but a nine-hour operation in which her genitalia was totally mutilated - with her vagina relocated and her clitoral hood remove

'When I went to Dr Burt and asked, "What have you done?" he said, "What are you talking about?" I found out from other doctors that I had been mutilated.'

One doctor said her genitals looked like 'a fileted fish'.

Ordinary activities were impossible like sitting down and wearing pants. Having sex with her husband was excruciatingly painful and because of it, her 12-year marriage fell apart.

Dr Burt was a respected ob/gyn at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, and an advocate of redesigning women's genitalia to improve their sex life.

He even wrote a book about it in 1975 called Surgery of Love, the proponent of which was: 'Women are structurally inadequate for intercourse. This is a pathological condition amenable to surgery.'

He performed countless operations on women, leaving most of them horribly disfigured, for almost 20 years until he surrendered his medical license in 1989 following a barrage of complaints and lawsuits.

In 1988, the Ohio Medical Board cited Burt for alleged 'experimental and medical unnecessary surgical procedures, in some incidents without proper patient consent', as many women believed they were going through routine procedures like post-pregnancy repairs and hysterectomies.

St Elizabeth's Hospital began requiring Burt to use a 'a special consent form specific to love surgery' in 1979, according to ABC News. He himself admitted he did not always get proper consent for some of his earliest surgeries.

Dr Burt is now 91-years-old and bankrupt. He declined to comment on the article.

The surgeon she trusted: Dr James C. Burt was an eccentric but respected ob/gyn at St Elizabeth's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, and was a proponent of procedures to redesign women's genitalia

His son  James C. Burt III, 68, of Los Angeles, defended his father's medical practices to ABC: 'There are hundreds and hundreds of Dr Burt's patients, alive today, whose marriages and lives were dramatically improved by his wholesome restoration to their fully functioning sexual responsiveness, which most of those patients had previously enjoyed earlier in their marriages.

'Until there are those in the media or the medical profession who are willing to look at the successful results, which fully benefited the lives of countless numbers of his patients, there should and will be no further comment on behalf of Dr Burt or his family.'

Dillon eventually settled out of court with St Elizabeth's Hospital. She was one of the first to file a malpractice lawsuit against them and Burt in 1985.

She is now writing a book about her experience.

When the now-65-year-old first went to Burt, Dillon was already in a happy second marriage with three children. He told her, 'You don't really need to have more kids'.

'I went ahead and got a hysterectomy,' Dillon said. 'You trust your doctor'.

After weeks of constant pain, she went to see another doctor for a second opinion.

She explains: I asked for the best doctor, because I had to find out what was wrong with me. He looked at me and called in one of the nurses and said, "Have you ever seen anything like this?"

'He had repositioned my vagina and circumcised me. The doctor said he had never seen it anywhere except in African tribes.

'The way I was deformed, I couldn't have sex. I ended up going through three different corrective surgeries but by that time, my marriage was shot and I lost the best thing that had happened in my life.'

When she went public with her story a number of other women came forward with similar stories.

Several other women filed malpractice lawsuits against Burt, but according to the New York Times, many of the cases were dropped because doctors would not testify.

Dillon has moved back to Ohio to care for her elderly parents who both have Alzheimer's.

Though she says she still lives with the effects of what happened: 'My life has taken a lot of different turns and ups and downs. So much of it happened because of that part of my life.'
