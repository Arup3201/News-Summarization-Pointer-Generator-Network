Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has admitted that Wayne Rooney might be his best striker but insists the Old Trafford captain has to continue playing where it suits the team.

Van Gaal's decision to play Rooney in midfield for the majority of this season has come under scrutiny with United accused of playing dull football despite a run of just one defeat in 18 matches.

England manager Roy Hodgson has confirmed Rooney – who is closing on the all-time goalscoring records for Manchester United and England - will operate as a striker at international level, saying: 'He's a goalscorer, isn't he?'

The United boss, whose side travel to League One Preston North End on Monday night for a potentially awkward FA Cup fifth round tie, has tried to explain his policy on Rooney.

He said he understood Hodgson's position regarding England but argued he had a different set of issues at United, with Robin van Persie, Radomel Falcao, Marouane Fellaini and James Wilson also available up front.

'Maybe, he (Rooney) is the best striker but I have to look at where a player can make the biggest contribution, and compare that to other players also.

'The composition of the team is more important than the individual player. I am sorry but that's the way it is. Rooney probably gives more contribution to Mr Hodgson playing in a striker's position, and I'd also put him there if I was coach of England.

'He has to compare Wayne Rooney with the strikers he can put in the line-up, and that is a consideration I have to make at United and my consideration is a different one. I have to choose between Falcao, van Persie and all the other strikers I have.'

Van Gaal's admission that Rooney is not playing in midfield through a lack of ability as a centre-forward does raise doubts about how he views some of United's big-money signings in central areas.

Struggling Falcao will be judged on more than just goals alone, insists Van Gaal

Juan Mata (£38million), Ander Herrera (£28million) and Marouane Fellaini (£27million) are considered inferior midfield players to Rooney and the United boss clearly doesn't see Angel di Maria (£60million) or Ashley Young (£18million) as the answer in central midfield.

Fellaini's size and physical strength may get him a start at Deepdale having played an important part in seeing off another lower league team, Cambridge United, in the last round.

Though youngster James Wilson is pushing for a start, there may be another chance given to Colombian striker Falcao whose four goals this season have been a poor return given the hype when he signed on deadline day in the summer.

With Robin van Persie due to be rested for a minor ailment, van Gaal defended Falcao's contribution. United have to decide by April whether to turn his loan move from Monaco into a permanent £43million deal.

'I shall not only judge on the goals. It is a bigger view than that,' said van Gaal. 'There are more aspects for a striker, an assist is an aspect and being available on the pitch for your fellow players is also an aspect.

'You have seen the header back for Chris Smalling (for United's opening goal against Burnley on Wednesday night) was from Falcao.'

Despite United being in a top-four position having finished seventh last season under David Moyes, van Gaal has faced plenty of criticism in the past week with West Ham manager Sam Allardyce saying the team played long-ball football last weekend, and ex-United great Paul Scholes saying the players looked miserable.

Goalkeeper David de Gea has been United's best performing player by far this season

The Dutch manager, who is used to working in high-pressure arenas like Barcelona and Bayern Munich, is coming out fighting, and not even United's best player this season goalkeeper David de Gea is exempt.

Asked if the Spaniard had won a lot of points for United this season, van Gaal snapped back: 'I think he doesn't save many points because he is my goalkeeper and his obligation is to hold balls. And you are thinking that is an exception for other goalkeepers and it is not like that, I am sorry for that.'

United have not won the FA Cup since 2004 and the competition represents their only chance of winning their first trophy of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era.

Van Gaal is expected to name a strong line-up – with Rooney again in midfield – though he is missing Phil Jones (calf) and Michael Carrick (ankle) with Daley Blind (head) doubtful.
