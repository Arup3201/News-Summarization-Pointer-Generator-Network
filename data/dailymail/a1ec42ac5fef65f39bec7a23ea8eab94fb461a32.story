Generous benefactors who lent treasures to a British museum have discovered they may have been sold by the museum which has since closed.

The relics were loaned to the British and Empire Commonwealth Museum as part of an exhibition telling the story of Britain's colonial heritage.

But it has now emerged that 144 items are unaccounted for and at least one, a 19th Century maritime oil painting belonging to Lord Caldecote, has been sold for £61,000.

Sold: This painting of the Honourable East India Company's ship Dunira passing Funchal Bay was sold at Christie's

Trustees of the museum, which has now closed, are currently in talks with eight owners about compensation.

The embarrassing situation appears to have arisen from a mix-up over whether the items were given or just loaned to the museum in Bristol.

Lord Caldecote said he had only learnt of the sale after he asked for the painting to be returned following his father's death.

He said: 'I contacted the museum and asked, "Could we have the painting back?" and unfortunately, they said "No, this painting was given to the museum".

'We subsequently discovered it had been sold by Christie's on behalf of the museum.

'I said "No, this is not right because we have a document here that clearly shows it was loaned to the museum, not given".'

Now closed: The former British Empire & Commonwealth Museum at Temple Meads, Bristol, shut in 2008

Lord Caldecote said his later father had loaned the painting to the museum, which opened in Isambard Kingdom Brunel's original Temple Meads station in 2002.

The artwork depicts the East India Company ship, the Dunira, and was painted by sailor-turned-artist Thomas Buttersworth - Lord Caldecote's great, great grandfather who captained the ship.

The artwork was sold at auction by Christie's to the government of Portugese island Madeira - pictured in the background - when the museum closed in 2008.

Lord Caldecote said: 'I suppose the museum is to blame, because they didn't have a proper stock check and maybe somebody in the museum went, shall we say, off-piste rather than follow all the correct procedures.'

The situation was exposed in an investigation by the BBC's Inside Out West programme, to be aired tonight.

Bristol City Council, which is in charge of the museum's exhibits after its closure in 2008, said they could not say how many items were missing because they did not have a full audit to compare the past and present collections.

However the museum's trustees revealed that 144 loan items were still unaccounted for.

The latest accounts for the museum show that former director, Gareth Griffiths, had undertaken a number of 'unauthorised transactions' but said there was no suggestion anyone had made personal profits from the sales.

Griffiths, who was dismissed in February 2011, insisted that the care and security of the collection was the trustees' responsibility.

He added that any objects were disposed of with the knowledge and agreement of the trustees and that the receipts were fully audited.

He said: 'I never benefited from any sales of material and will regard any such inference as actionable.'

The BBC programme also traced several other items that went missing from a collection gifted to the museum in 2003 by the former Commonwealth Institute.

One item, a statuette of John Robert Godley, the founder of Christchurch in New Zealand, was sold alongside others by an unknown dealer.

A report by the Metropolitan Police, which investigated claims that the statue and other items were being sold by a dealer in London, said the trader took about 150 items and paid the museum £115,000.

The trader has since returned some items including the statue.

Sir Neil Cossons, who took over as chairman of the board of trustees, said there was no authorisation for the sales and the trustees had not known.

He said: 'There was no authorisation at all of any of the material that went to the London dealer and certainly not of the Dunira painting.

'These are items that went from our possession without the knowledge or the authority of the trustees and a large part of the time the trustees have been spending since our director was dismissed has been trying to get to the bottom of those issues.

'The difficulty is that trustees are not generally speaking in the day-to-day management and operation of the enterprise for which they are trustees.

'And in our case we delegated to a responsible, paid director with some staff and all the indications were that this was a professional doing a professional job.'

He added that it was fair to say that 'dozens' of items were unaccounted for, but also admitted that the total may never be known precisely.

The museum opened in 2002 in Isambard Kingdom Brunel's original Temple Meads station and won a string of awards.

However the museum struggled to attract enough visitors to make it financially viable, and plans to rescue it by moving it to London fell through.

The site in Bristol was chosen because of the historic connection with the empire, through voyages of exploration, trade - including slavery - piracy, shipbuilding and the railways.
