Wells Fargo fired an employee over the cost of treating his daughter's terminal cancer with company health care coverage, according to a lawsuit filed last week.

Yovany Gonzalez, a former mortgage broker, was sacked by America’s fourth-largest bank in August 2010. His dismissal came three days before surgeons were set to operate on his daughter Mackenzie in a last-ditch bid to save her life.

The lawsuit claims Mackenzie’s operation
was cancelled because she was no longer covered by Wells Fargo’s 
employee health insurance. Mr Gonzalez’s daughter died in March 2011.

Shocking: Yovany Gonzalez claims in a new lawsuit that he was fired from his post at mega-bank Wells Fargo over the exorbitant cost of his daughter's cancer treatments under the company health care plan.

Mr. Gonzalez's lawsuit was filed last Thursday at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, Florida.

The suit doesn't link Mr. Gonzalez's ouster - and his policy's cancellation - to his daughter's demise, as a Good Samaritan charity subsequently spotted him a year's health coverage under COBRA, a lawyer for Mr Gonzalez reportedly said.

But certain statements allegedly made by Wells Fargo personnel, as well as those on the part of United Health Care reps, just prior to Mr. Gonzalez's dismissal, cast the bank's acts in something of a suspicious light.

Around the time of Mr. Gonzalez's ouster, Wells Fargo and United Health Care reps asked his wife ‘numerous questions’ about her daughter’s treatment and made ‘several references… to the cost of her treatment,’ the lawsuit states.

Also, around the same time as these cagey comments, Mr. Gonzalez's Wells Fargo supervisor alighted on something of a witch hunt, the suit alleges, searching for reasons to fire the beleaguered employee.

Gonzalez, a mortgage broker for the mega bank, was canned three days before a costly, scheduled operation to stave off Mackenzie's cancer

'This was a loss of an innocent child's life,' The Huffington Post has quoted Jack Scarola as saying. Scarola is acting as an attorney for Mr.  Gonzalez.

'There were [some] Wells Fargo employees who not only lacked compassion, but seemed to have been motivated by entirely improper concerns about finances,' Mr. Scarola reportedly added of the suit.

However, Wells Fargo strongly denied the the startling allegations laid out in Mr. Gonzalez's legal action.

'While we're very sympathetic to Mr Gonzalez for his personal loss,' a Wells Fargo spokesman wrote in a statement, 'his termination was unrelated to the allegations included in the lawsuit.

'We intend to vigorously defend the matter in court. We support and value our team members and our employment practices are in alignment with that focus.'

According to the lawsuit, Wells Fargo claimed Mr. Gonzalez was fired because he allegedly handed in falsified time records.

Mr. Gonzalez countered that allegation, claiming in court documents that his manager inputted his time sheets into the company system, and told him he could always recollect payment for the extra hours he worked.

Doctors diagnosed Mackenzie with cancer in December 2008, and in order to assist with her treatment, Mr. Gonzalez started working in different locations.

Pulling the plug: The procedure to fight MacKenzie's cancer was canceled, but a charity stepped in and paid for Gonzalez's COBRA coverage. His daughter died seven months later in March 2011

The lawsuit also states that Wells Fargo failed to give Mr. Gonzalez information about how to continue his family's life insurance coverage - information he says he was promised after he was fired.

The insurance plan, which included life insurance for his children, was consequently cancelled after he left the company. It meant that when Mackenzie died, Mr. Gonzalez was unable to receive life insurance compensation.

Wells Fargo, which logged some $16 billion in profit in 2011, denies the link between Gonzalez's ouster and cost of Mackenzie's treatments. It has vowed to fight the suit

While an employee who loses their job is permitted to extend health insurance coverage under the COBRA law as long as they continue paying the full premium, it took more than 90 days for Wells Fargo to send Gonzalez information about how to extend his policy.

Mr. Gonzalez began working for Wachovia in 2007. The company was bought by Wells Fargo in 2008 amidst the American banking crisis.

He
is now employed by JP Morgan Chase for less pay, according to the lawsuit.

The suit also says Chase 
is not letting Gonzalez sell securities because of the reasons that 
Wells Fargo gave for firing him.

As for Wells Fargo, the company logged nearly $16 billion in net profits - and recorded almost $90 billion in total revenue - in 2011, the same year little Mackenzie died.
