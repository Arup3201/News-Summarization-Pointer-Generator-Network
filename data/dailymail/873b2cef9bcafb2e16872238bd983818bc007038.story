Two thirds of Brits are greeted by rain when they return home after a holiday in the sun abroad, according to a survey.

Passengers landing at Manchester and Glasgow airports are more likely that anywhere else in the UK to face stormy skies when they fly back from a warm trip overseas.

And, despite grey clouds being a usual feature of the UK skyline, some 67 per cent of holidaymakers are inappropriately dressed for the British weather.

Welcome home!

The poll of more than 2,000 British adults who had been on a sunshine break in the past 12 months was conducted by online travel agency www.sunshine.co.uk.

When asked: ‘When your return flight home landed in the UK after your hot holiday abroad, was it raining?’ two fifths of the respondents said ‘yes’.

Two thirds of these, 65 per cent, said that this was despite the fact they had returned home to the UK in a summer month of June, July or August. 

Anyone who returned to rain was asked what airport they had landed at when flying back to the UK, which revealed Manchester to be the most common answer, followed by Glasgow.

Summer clothing: Half of Brits wear their holiday outfits on the plane home - despite being greeted by rain

And more than two thirds of the total respondents admitted that they were inappropriately dressed when they landed back at a UK airport, wearing clothes suited for their holiday but not for the British weather. 

More than half of these were wearing flip flops or sandals, whilst 39 per cent admitted to having either shorts, a dress or a skirt on. 

While 43 per cent of the respondents taking part said it took them on average seven days to adjust to the British weather again.

Chris Clarkson, Managing Director of sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘When you’ve just started to get used to the scorching heat abroad, there’s nothing worse than landing back in the UK to single figure temperatures and rain, rain and more rain. 

‘It’s always best to expect the worst when dressing for a flight home to the UK, meaning closed toe footwear and at least a light jacket in your hand luggage.

'It’s not a nice thought, but no one can every truly rely on the British weather... even in summer!'
