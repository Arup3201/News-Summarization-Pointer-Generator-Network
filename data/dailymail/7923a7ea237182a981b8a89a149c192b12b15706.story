Sarah Ferguson has lost two stone after embarking on a gruelling three-month bootcamp in the Swiss Alps.

The newly-trim Duchess of York, 54, who once weighed almost 16 stone, shed the pounds with the help of her personal trainer of 20 years Josh Salzmann.

She has reportedly seen the weight fall off after sticking to a strict diet of blended foods, daily runs and mountain hikes over the past 12 weeks.

But while she has been put through her paces daily, it hasn't all been so tough.

The mother-of-two and Salzmann stayed at a luxury seven-bedroom, £17,000-a-week chalet in ski resort Verbier, reports the Mirror - the same one she stayed at last Christmas.

The upmarket chalet comes equipped with its own swimming pool and sauna.

The pair were accompanied by a TV crew filming for a documentary to be screened in America in 2014.

One dubbed the 'Duchess of Pork', Sarah, who lives at Royal Lodge in Berkshire, showed off her new slimline figure at a charity lunch in Los Angeles.

Wearing a demure black ensemble, she said she wants to use her weight loss ­experience to help raise awareness of the battle against obesity.

'I went up to the mountains, and I ran every day. That's how I got fit,' she said.

In the summer months the Duchess was much heavier. Pictured here at the Butterfuly Ball in May

'I may have lost 30lbs, but I want to help combat global obesity.

'I want to really get into America and support young children who need to be educated about the future.'

In 1992 the Duchess wrote the foreword to Salzmann's book Bodyfit for Life, and the pair teamed up again in 2000 for Dieting with the Duchess: Secrets and Sensible Advice for a Great Body.

The trainer's famous clients reportedly include Angelina Jolie, 38, and Scarlett Johansson, 29.

While the Duchess remains close to the Queen's son Prince Andrew, 53, despite their divorce in 1996, this December marks her Christmas in Verbier after reportedly being banned from the Royal 
Family's celebrations at Sandringham.

In 2012 Sarah kept a slimmer figure. She has since gained and lost weight following a boot camp

The couple's daughters Princesses 
Beatrice, 25, and Eugenie, 23, spent Christmas with the Queen and 
the rest of the royals. They are expected to join their mother for the New 
Year at the luxury chalet.

'Beatrice and Eugenie always go and spend the holidays with their grandmother because I love Her Majesty so much.

'I think it's very important she has the best gift I can give her, which is my children.'
