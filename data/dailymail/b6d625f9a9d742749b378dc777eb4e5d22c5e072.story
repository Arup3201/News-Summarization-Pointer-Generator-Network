This is the heartstopping moment when a biker swerved within inches of a HGV during a high speed police chase which reached speeds of almost 150mph.

Paul Roberts, 43, was seen weaving wildly between three lanes of rush-hour traffic with a passenger on his high-powered Kawasaki ZZR 1400 motorbike during the pursuit last September.

The incredible footage, filmed by an unmarked police officer, shows Roberts come within inches of an HGV, then accelerate to speeds in excess of 148mph along the southbound M11 near Chigwell in Essex.

His top speed is believed to be the highest ever recorded in the UK by a rider carrying a pillion passenger, the force said.

When confronted over his potentially deadly driving, he replied: 'I know it's not an excuse, but I knew they wouldn't get out of the way.'

Roberts, who runs a taxi firm in London, admitted dangerous driving at Chelmsford Crown Court and was banned from the road for 15 months. 

Recorder Colin Chandler said: 'Weaving in and out of traffic and undertaking, even within the speed limit, is what people would call 'hairy'.

'When it is done at speeds of up to and over 100mph - it can only be described as outrageous and nothing less. 

'You are lucky that no one in this case was hurt or injured.'

The court heard how Roberts had been speeding to work at around 7.30am on September 12 last year when he was seen by PC Paul Hills during a motorbike patrol to cut down on rush hour collisions.

PC Hills pursued the reckless biker at speeds of up to 148mph but took four miles of road to catch Roberts.

Geoffrey Porter, prosecuting, said: 'You will see the defendant weaving in between traffic and undertaking cars in lane three and two. 'When not doing that, he is accelerating.

After dodging between a HGV and car, the rider was filmed by officers in the unmarked police car in pursuit pulling in front of a car

'He also is seen to pass between vehicles in heavy traffic. 'The officer describes it as 'making himself and his passenger the meat in a sandwich'.

'The highest speed recorded by PC Hills is up to 148mph.

'In his opinion, he was not making ground on the motorcycle being ridden by the defendant at this speed.'

When spoken to about his speeding, he told the officer: 'I know it's not an excuse, but I knew they wouldn't get out of the way.' 

Roberts, from Harlow, Essex, pleaded guilty to one count of dangerous driving at an earlier hearing.

He had been told he could face up to two years in prison before his sentencing today.

The father-of-two claimed he had accelerated as he was carrying thousands of pounds in cash and cheques on his bike and feared he was being chased by the unmarked cop.

The rider then accelerates to 148mph- the fastest speed recorded by police for a motorcyclist carrying a passenger

Roberts was later seen weaving in between two cars along the southbound M11 near Chigwell in Essex

Kenneth Aylett, mitigating, said: 'The officer was not in a marked vehicle and was plain clothed.

'With an unmarked bike trailing him for a while he began to worry he was being trailed for the money.'

Roberts was banned from driving for 15 months and will have to complete an extended driving test before being allowed back on the roads.

He was also fined £400 costs and ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge as well as completing 120 hours unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order.

Outside court, Sgt Nick Edwards, who runs the Essex Police motorcycle unit, said: 'This is probably the highest speed recorded in Essex and is also the highest recorded in the UK with a pillion passenger. 

Roberts was recorded weaving wildly between three lanes of rush-hour traffic on his high-powered Kawasaki ZZR 1400 motorbike

'It is only through good fortune no injuries or deaths were caused by his driving that day. I'm satisfied with the severity of the sentence. 

'The fact that imprisonment was considered as an option is welcomed.' 

Sergeant Nick Edwards, from the force's motorcycle unit, said: 'The levels of harm to which Paul Roberts subjected himself, his pillion passenger, the public and my officer are just beyond comprehension.

'These speeds are for race tracks not public roads. This riding behaviour will not be tolerated on Essex roads and the court have clearly recognised the consequences of the rider's actions in the punishment that has been awarded.'
