A drunk thief with more than 30 previous convictions walked into a Magistrates' Court and stole a desktop computer just nine days after being released from prison.

James Vale from Norwich entered the court building looking for a friend when he spotted a suitcase containing the computer and carried it home with him.

The 39-year-old criminal was arrested the following day after he stole two t-shirts from Primark and a mouthwash from Boots.

While being questioned he admitted stealing the computer from the court.

Vale's defence solicitor Alistair Taunton told Norwich Magistrates' Court: 'The theft from here was stupid.

'He came here looking for a friend. He had had some alcohol. He saw it and he took it.

'He took it home. He had no idea what he was going to do with it.

Mr Taunton added: “He woke up the following day, sober, and wondered "What the hell have I done?"

'He was trying to work out a way to get around his error and get it back somehow. But in the end he did not have a chance to and admitted it to the police.'

He said Vale, who was jailed yesterday for 26 weeks for the thefts, was on medication for mental health problems.

Mr Taunton told Magistrates this incident, his client had asked a worker at the City Reach Clinic to put his name forward for a computer course to allow him to improve his chance of getting a job.

Norfolk Police said that Vale took the desktop computer between 4.30pm and 4.40pm on Thursday May 29.

The Courts and Tribunal Service insisted that there was no sensitive information on the stolen computer.

A spokesperson added: 'HM Courts and Tribunals Service takes the issue of security within courts extremely seriously and we are urgently investigating the circumstances of this incident.

'Security checks are carried out at all courts across the country to safeguard the public and to prevent illegal activity taking place on court premises.

'Public areas in all courts are patrolled regularly.'
