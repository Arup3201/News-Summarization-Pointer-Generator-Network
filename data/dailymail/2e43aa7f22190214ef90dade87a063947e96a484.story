Bilal Mirza (pictured) 18, was fatally stabbed as he walked through Marylebone, in central London, at around 10.40pm on Thursday

A mother wept in court as her teenage son was remanded in custody over the murder of a young man who was stabbed to death in central London.

Bilal Mirza, 18, had been walking along a street in Marylebone, London at around 10.40pm on Thursday when he was attacked and stabbed. He  later died in hospital.

Now a 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is accused of fatally wounding Bilal. 

He is also charged with possession of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or reasonable excuse in a public place in relation to a multi-tool knife.

Appearing at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court, he was told that his case will be heard at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.

Dressed in black and with her head covered, the boy's mother spoke to him briefly before he was sent to a youth detention centre.

The youth tried to touch his mother's hand through the dock's glass panels and also began to cry as he was taken away.

District Judge Denis Brennan told the defendant: 'I have no power other than to send the matter to the Central Criminal Court and I do so together with the allegation of possession of an offensive weapon.'

The court heard that police were called to reports of a stabbing outside Lea House on Salisbury Street on Thursday night.

Bilal was taken to a central London hospital where he was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination gave a stab wound to the thigh as the cause of death.

Scotland Yard have appealed to local youths to come forward with information.

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: 'My condolences are with Bilal's family at this tragic time, and our investigation continues to evidence exactly what took place and led to his death.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is charged with the murder and one count of possession of an offensive weapon  in a public place

'Whilst we have had good support from local community affected by this violent crime, and a number of witnesses come forward, I continue my appeals for more people, especially young people, to come forward.

'I know that there were several youths in the area at the time of the stabbing and I am appealing directly to them to come forward and speak with officers.

'They can be assured that any call they make to us will be treated in the strictest of confidence.

'If you were in the area and saw what happened please call our incident room.'

The teen has been remanded in custody until the case is heard at London's Old Bailey on 13 January.
