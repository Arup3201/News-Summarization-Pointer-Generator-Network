It was when Lewis Moody met up with his former England team-mates earlier this week that it struck him just how much he had missed rugby and how glad he is to be back in the game again.

On Wednesday night, the 36-year-old was among familiar faces at the Dorchester Hotel in London to take his place at Jonny Wilkinson’s testimonial dinner. The following evening, he was a world away from that glittering occasion, taking training at Bradford-on-Avon RFC in his new role as the club’s director of rugby.

For the ex-Leicester and Bath flanker, World Cup-winner and decorated Lion, this is the grass-roots role which has given him a taste of coaching that he is relishing, and a route back into the cut and thrust of a sporting life. It may be several rungs below the level he occupied during his playing career, but he is embracing the earthier surroundings of Southern Counties League South.

Spending an evening with the men he used to stand shoulder to shoulder with in the Test arena reminded Moody about the joys of a sporting life. ‘Seeing all those guys again, they’re all doing totally different things,’ he said. ‘It’s quite strange. But when you get back into that circle again, it makes you miss rugby so much. This really gives me the connection to the game that I need.’

Moody lives in Bradford-on-Avon, having spent the last years of his playing career at nearby Bath. This venture into coaching began with taking his children to the club for minis rugby and going along to train there with his brother-in-law. That led to some coaching input and during the summer, he was asked if the ad hoc arrangement could become more formal.

‘I thought, “I love it here and I love being involved in rugby again”,’ he said. ‘I had been out of it for two years and this is much more of a grass-roots level, but the guys have so much enthusiasm. 

‘You realise that you can’t have a professional mind-set, because all these lads have jobs. We’ve got labourers, teachers, sportsmen, students, architects, all sorts — a really wide range of guys here. There’s a full spectrum here, then you’ve got private schools, local schools, all sorts of backgrounds.

‘The first time I came along to training there were eight or nine guys, now we get regularly over 20, which is fantastic. It’s an opportunity for me to get back into the sport I love and give a bit back. I’m really enjoying it.’

There was a strong turn-out on Thursday for a session on the floodlit pitch. Moody held a coaches’ meeting in the clubhouse first, then went out to take charge of training. He is swiftly discovering that, in the amateur game, his official title covers a vast remit.

Moody is relishing his connection to grassroots rugby and his first coaching role 

‘I’m director of rugby, which covers a lot of bases — trying to organise the club a little bit more so that it is unified across the board, to create more of a one-club identity,’ he said. ‘There are a lot of teams here and I’m just trying to align them a little bit better, so we can compete. The guys have come up this year from the division below and it’s tough for them. They have lost the first couple of games but it’s not about being a professional club. It’s about creating a strong club that everyone enjoys being part of and make it an important part of the community.

‘The club has only been going about 25 years and the guys running it have done a great job. Now it’s about taking that next step, to get more players along and get everyone enjoying their rugby. Hopefully me being here will help — guys will want to come along to see what I’m doing here.’

What he is doing is running his Mad Dog Sport coaching clinics at the club for junior players — enlisting the help of friends and contacts such as Dan Hipkiss, Lee Mears, Andy Robinson and Stuart Hooper — as well as taking charge of the first XV. There are obvious challenges for someone with Moody’s elite background, but he is learning to adapt.

‘There are certain things that you just see as normal, like lifting for kick-offs and in the lineout,’ he said. ‘As a professional player, that sort of thing is all part of the routine, but you are sort of starting from the beginning here. At first, I gave them far too much information, so I’m trying to rein myself back in again.

‘The guys are picking it all up really quickly. They are enthused by me being here but I am enthused by them, too — they just probably don’t realise that!’

Moody is sufficiently enthused by his experience so far to be open-minded about where it might take him. Having been busy with various projects since retiring as a player, he had not shown an inclination to explore a full-time coaching career, but now he wouldn’t rule it out.

‘I don’t know,’ he said, when asked about the possibility. ‘When I retired, I stepped away from the game because I had been in it 17 years and I didn’t want my life to just revolve around the game every weekend. Coming here has got me enthused about the management side of the game and coaching. At the minute I love it. If something comes of it then great, but I just love it for what it is at the moment.’

His new role has already thrown up one difficult scenario. As a prominent supporter of the Mail on Sunday’s concussion campaign, Moody is well aware of the threat posed by the issue and he had to confront it in Bradford’s season opener at Walcot.

‘In our first game, we had two concussions,’ he said. ‘One of the guys stepped out of the line and smashed someone with a great hit, which stopped a try, but he knocked himself out cold. There was me thinking, “There’s a decision to be made here” but there was no real decision to be made, we knew he had to come off.

‘When someone questioned what he was going to do the next week, I just said, “He’s having three weeks off, no contact, then we’ll assess him again”. Trouble is; now that he’s not allowed to do contact for a bit, he’s stopped coming to training!

‘The other one wasn’t quite as bad — he was sat on the ground feeling a bit dizzy. You realise how difficult it is for doctors, because he’s on the sideline saying, “I’m fine, I’m ready to go back on”. We just have one physio from Bath University, but we’re lucky because a lot of teams at this level don’t even have that.’

It was an early test of Moody’s ability to handle the decision-making demands of management. He handled it well. There will be others. It will be a learning process, but he’s just glad to be back in the game again.
