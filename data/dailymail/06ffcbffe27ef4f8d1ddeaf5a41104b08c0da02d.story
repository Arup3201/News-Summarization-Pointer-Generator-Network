The ex-boyfriend of one of the stars of MTV's Teen Mom 3 has been arrested after posting several explicit videos of her performing sexual acts on social media in 'revenge' after their breakup

Brianna DeJesus, 20, had cut Shakiel Brown, 23, out of her life after she discovered that he had been unfaithful, allegedly impregnating another young woman.

In response, Brown, of Orlando, Florida, posted two explicit 'revenge porn' videos on Twitter and Instagram and tried to sell the clips to several gossip websites.

Brianna DeJesus, 20, was subjected to a 'revenge porn' attack by her ex-boyfriend, who posted explicit videos of her on social media which she had not consented to being filmed

Although 'revenge porn' - spreading explicit material of a former partner with the intent to cause hurt - is not illegal in Florida, Brown was arrested as Miss DeJesus had not consented to being filmed.

Brown has been charged with one felony count of video voyeurism, and has been released on a $3,500 bail.

The couple had been dating for just under one year when Miss DeJesus broke it off earlier this year following claims of infidelity, the Orlando Sentiel reports. 

Upon hearing that Brown had made another woman pregnant, Miss DeJesus blocked his telephone number and refused to speak to him.

Shortly afterwards, the videos appeared on social media. 

Miss DeJesus, who also appeared on 16 and Pregnant, says she had no idea that she was being filmed, although the sex itself was consensual.

She told police she was unaware the videos existed until they appeared on Brown's Twitter and Instagram  accounts this month.

'All my friends were talking about it so I went to see for myself,' Miss DeJesus, of Orlando, told the newspaper. 

'He really posted all those videos of me on there... I was hurt and shocked.

Miss DeJesus also discovered that Brown had tried to sell the 'revenge porn' to several gossip sites, including TMZ, as his email account was still connected to her computer.

The email, which Miss DeJesus's mother published on her Twitter, reads: 'I have some very interesting videos I know would be a hit.... 

'I have videos of (DeJesus) doing some pretty naughty things, if you guys are interested get back to me as soon as possible,' said an email sent from Brown's email address. 

'That's probably what hurt the most,' Miss DeJesus said. 'Why would you try to use my name to make money off of something so private?'

Brown admitted to posting the videos and the explicit material has since been removed from social media.

Brown's bail conditions state that he is not allowed to contact Miss DeJesus or use social media.
