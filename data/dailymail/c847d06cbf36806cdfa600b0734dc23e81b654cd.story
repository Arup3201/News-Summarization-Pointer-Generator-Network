'Blood': Pat Major had smashed a bottle of cough mixture in store and it was leaking out of her boot

An innocent grandmother was shocked to be stopped on suspicion of having a dead body in her car.

The suspicious bystander had seen the 60-year-old prodding something in the car and red liquid seeping out.

In fact, the 'blood' was simply a broken bottle of cough syrup - and the mysterious cargo was her shopping from Asda.

The amateur detective had noticed Pat Major struggling to shut the boot of her Nissan Micra in the car park of the Newton Abbot supermarket.

She tailed the grandmother in her car as she headed for her daughter Shona's home in Newton Abbot, Devon, before spotting the scarlet trail leaking out.

The eagle-eyed shopper rang 999 to tell police what she had seen, adding: 'There appears to be blood pouring from the boot.'

A response team was despatched immediately, but the specialist officers' concern quickly turned to amusement when they found that the blood-soaked body in 
the boot was merely squashed bags of shopping.

Among the bags was a
glass bottle of blackcurrant Asda's Own cough mixture, which Mrs Major had accidentally 
smashed in the store.

Luckily, Mrs Major, a housekeeper at Ashburton's Dartmoor Lodge, saw the funny side.

She said: 'I didn't have much space in the boot because I needed other stuff there in case it snowed.

'I can see why my actions were thought to be suspicious.

'I think the witness needs a pat on the back for being so vigilant as it did look a bit odd.'

Mystery solved: Police discovered the red liquid was a smashed glass bottle of Asda cough syrup

She admitted her efforts to cram all her shopping into the boot could have been misconstrued.

Mrs Major, a grandmother of five from Ashburton, said the two investigating officers thought the incident last Saturday evening was hilarious.

'They left laughing, saying I should not be thinking of murdering anyone that night,' she said.

A police spokesman said: 'We could be excused for going menthol about this. Fortunately there was nothing to linctus to a major crime investigation.'
