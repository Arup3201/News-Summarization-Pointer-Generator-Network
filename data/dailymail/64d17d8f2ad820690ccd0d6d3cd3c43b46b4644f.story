Motorists were surprised to see the bird perched on eggs in between the red and amber signals in Leicester city centre

This bird obviously thinks it has been given the green light to start nesting in January, after it chose a city centre traffic light to build its home.

Baffled motorists in Leicester were surprised to see the bird perched on eggs in between the red and amber signals.

Even more aptly it appeared this early bird had used some Christmas wrapping ribbon to help it make its nest.

Photographer Jason Senior, 40, from Leicester, said the bird had chosen a set of traffic lights in Leicester city centre.

He said: 'There were a lot of people standing around looking at this bird, I suppose it thought it had the green light to start nesting so early.

'If you look closely you can see ribbon from what might be Christmas wrapping in with the twigs in the nest

'I was there for about half an hour and the bird seemed pretty happy and oblivious to all the commotion around it.'

Gemma Hogg, from the RSPB, said the bird was likely to be either a mistle or song thrush.

She said: 'Birds make their nests in all sorts of unusual places, and this isn't the first traffic light nest we've seen - in the past we've had birds nesting in, bins, hanging baskets and even an ash tray outside a pub.

'It may seem odd to us, but it's actually quite common. They see a safe, secure and cosy spot to lay eggs and raise chicks and don't care what it looks like or what the neighbours might think.

'This nest might not seem like an obvious choice, but perhaps the warmth from the lights makes it a sensible one.

'It's hard to tell if this bird is a song or mistle thrush without seeing its chest. Both are early breeders and have two to three broods a year.

'They normally start late February so this is pretty early. The mild weather towards the end of last year and beginning of this one may have prompted them to nest, but the current cold snap will have given them a bit of a shock.

'The RSPB recommends putting out high energy foods in gardens to help your birds get through the winter. A supply of unfrozen, fresh water is also really important.'

Gemma said with the RSPB's Big Garden Birdwatch coming up on the weekend of January 26 and 27, keeping your feeders, tables and bird baths topped-up will not only make sure your garden visitors are well fed and looked after, it will also encourage them into your garden just in time for you to take part in the world's biggest wildlife survey.
