A mother and father charged with murdering their nine-month old daughter - who died from 'severe malnourishment' - appeared in court today. 

Brian Kandare, 32, and wife Precious, 36, from Wolverhampton, have been charged with daughter Rebecca's murder.

The baby was rushed to New Cross Hospital, in Wolverhampton, from her home on January 6 this year.

Despite attempts to save her, Rebecca, who suffered from rickets, died from pneumonia as a result of severe malnourishment.

Her parents were arrested at the time and later bailed.

But yesterday, West Midlands Police announced the pair had been charged with Rebecca's murder.

And today, the parents appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates' Court.

The couple were kept in custody after a brief hearing and are due at the city's Crown Court on Monday.

Earlier this year, Wolverhampton City Council said the child was not known to social care services.

At that time, residents in Park Village spoke of their shock at the baby's death.

Phil Yates, who has lived in the area for 35 years, said: 'It's a shock and sad to hear.'

Another woman who has lived in the area for 37 years added: 'It's a huge shock, terrible news. Some parts of Park Village are quiet and others are like a war zone but not all people here are bad.'

Councillor for Park Village, Milkinder Jaspal, said: 'This is disturbing news for the community and for people living in the rest of the city.'
