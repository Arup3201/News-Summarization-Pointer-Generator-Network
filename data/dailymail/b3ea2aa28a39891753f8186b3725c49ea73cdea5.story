Missing: Rui Li, 44, was last seen leaving Poole 
Hospital in Dorset, on the evening of last Friday and was reported 
missing four days later

Detectives investigating the disappearance of a nurse a week ago have arrested a second man on suspicion of murder.

Rui Li, 44, was last seen leaving Poole Hospital in Dorset, on the evening of last Friday and was reported missing to police by her family four days later.

On Wednesday, police arrested a 60-year-old Bournemouth man on suspicion of murder and he remains in custody after detectives were granted further time to question him.

Now a 26-year-old Bournemouth man, who is also known to Ms Li, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering the nurse.

Extensive investigations are going on, with forensic experts examining three addresses at Burnham Drive, Wolverton Road and St Clement’s Road, all in Boscombe, Dorset.

Ms Li’s distinctive Porsche Boxster, with personalised number plate L1 RUI, was found outside a property in Wolverton Road.

Police have released CCTV of the last known sighting of Ms Li, which shows her leaving the car park at the hospital at 6.17pm last Friday.

Detectives said she moved to the UK from China a decade ago and has worked at Poole Hospital since 2009.

They said Ms Li, who has a teenage daughter, led 'a private personal life' and officers were trying to build a picture of her lifestyle.

A Dorset Police spokesman said: 'A 26-year-old Bournemouth man, also known to Ms Li, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He is currently being questioned by detectives.

'Detectives have also been granted additional time to question the arrested 60-year-old Bournemouth man.'

Detective 
Inspector Marcus Hester, who is leading the inquiry, said yesterday: 'It
 is still absolutely crucial for the investigation to establish
 what has happened to Ms Li between Friday evening and Tuesday morning.

'I am hoping this image of her distinctive car may jog people's memories. Did you see her driving home that evening?'

Ms Li was last seen leaving the hospital and was reported missing by her
 family five days later

Colleagues at Poole Hospital, where Ms Li worked, pictured above, described her as 'funny and unique' and have urged members of the public to come forward with information

Det Insp Hester added: 'I am even interested to know if you saw the car moving around or being driven by anyone else over the Bank Holiday weekend. We are also building a better picture of her lifestyle, interests and friends.

'We
 know that she was a reliable and hardworking nurse at Poole Hospital, 
who was popular with her colleagues, and also that she enjoyed outdoors 
activities, including climbing.

'However, since moving to the UK from China around a decade ago, she has also led quite a private personal life.

'I am keen to speak to anyone who knows her well and would reassure them they are not breaking any trust by speaking to us.'

Her colleagues from Poole Hospital have appealed for the public's help in tracking down the missing nurse.

In a statement released by police, they said: 'Rui was a big character in our small close-knit team.

'Funny and so unique, she was totally reliable, professional and conscientious to a tee. She is terribly missed by all of us.

'Her nature was gentle and serene and that is part of the reason why we and the patients love her so much. If anybody knows anything please let the police know and help us find Rui.'

Ms Li is described as a slim woman of Chinese appearance who is about 5ft 5ins. She sometimes wears glasses and often has her shoulder-length black hair in a ponytail, police said.

Police said she came to the UK from China with her daughter around ten years ago and has worked as a nurse at Poole Hospital since April 2009.

She currently works in the medical investigations unit. Her teenage daughter is now receiving close support from police family liaison officers, a spokesman said.
