A former American Idol contestant forced to crowdsource funds so she can have life-saving brain surgery says it is staying in her small home town, and not moving to Los Angeles, that is saving her life.

Heather Cox Coe, of Elkin, North Carolina, was a Top 20 finalist on the fifth season of American Idol, and while public support couldn't get her to the final 12 of the popular reality show, the small town support she is getting now is saving her life, as she has already raised the $30,000 initial payment for her surgery.

And it's not just money that is helping the married mother of three get by these days.

Not going to Hollywood: Miss Coe was a Top 20 finalist on the fifth season of Idol (above), but says her decision to stay in her small own rather than move to L.A. and pursue her career has saved her life

'Having the community’s support as well as my church family has been one of the ways I’ve been able to stay strong through this,' the 31-year-old told the Elkin Tribune. 

'With a small town, someone is always there to give you a hug, tell you they’re praying for you, as well as cook you a meal if needed. Big cities may offer more to do, but my small town has literally been a life saver.'

Miss Coe revealed that back in her Idol days, host Ryan Seacrest urged her to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career, something she is now grateful she never followed through on, preferring to go back to her small town because 'the sense of community is so much greater.' 

She was diagnosed with having a pineal gland tumor in the center of her brain in 2010, which doctors initially said could only be removed by way of a dangerous craniotomy.

Even with this surgery however, there was still a chance she could end up with brain damage or even dead. 

Miss Coe has since found another doctor who will perform a less invasive surgery, which is good news for the mom whose three children, Lucius, 5, Jayden, 2, and 1-year-old Kaylen, are the biggest reason she keeps fighting.

“One of the most difficult thoughts that I have to battle is the thought of my three precious babies growing up without their mommy here,” she said.

Famous friends: Miss Coe (above with Ryan Seacrest) got some support from fellow Idol alums Kellie Pickler, Mandisa, and Chris Daughtry, who all publicized her cause

After reaching her first goal two days ago, no doubt thanks to some support from a few of her big name Idol pals like Kellie Pickler, Mandisa, and Chris Daughtry, who all publicized her efforts to raise money, Miss Coe thanked everyone on her GoFundMe page.

'THIS IS A HUGE THANK YOU to family, friends, anonymous donors, and to total strangers who felt it in your heart to give; you are all AMAZING and my heart continues to cry THANK YOU!!!!' she wrote.

Her ultimate goal is to raise $100,000. 

Miss Coe also says she is getting some major support from her husband, Curtis.

'The Lord has blessed me with a wonderful husband, Curtis, and he has been such a pillar of strength for me when I’ve needed it most, and we’ve birthed three beautiful children that have literally given me a reason to live,' she said.
