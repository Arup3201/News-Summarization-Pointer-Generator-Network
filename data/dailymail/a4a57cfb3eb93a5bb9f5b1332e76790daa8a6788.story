Abbey Clancy smoulders in provocative new images from her debut campaign for Ultimo's SS14 collection.

Clad in a pair of extreme low-rise, revealing lacy knickers with caged detailing, the
 model and Strictly Come Dancing winner, 28, is seen peeking over her shoulder as she gets into a car. In other pictures she wears a selection of harness bras as she leans back in a chair.

The shoot marks Abbey's first since she was announced as the new face 
and body of the lingerie giant in December.

Michelle Mone says Abbey is 'body-confident, beautiful and feminine - all the qualities associated with Ultimo'

The Strictly winner is seen flaunting her fabulous figure in a selection of racy Ultimo lingerie designs

The mother-of-one showcases her incredible figure in an enhanced Miracle Solutions range 
and brand new fashion lines, which cater for women from A through to DD 
cups, on sale from today.

Abbey
 replaces Michael Bublé's wife Luisana Lopilato in the first glimpse of 
the racy campaign, which coincides with the launch of Ultimo’s new 
website.

Michelle Mone 
OBE, Founder of Ultimo, said: 'Abbey looks incredible in our 
spring/summer campaign and embodies the Ultimo brand perfectly.

'She's
 body-confident, beautiful and feminine - all the qualities associated 
with Ultimo. 2014 is going to be a momentous year for the brand and this
 is the perfect start.'

She
 added: 'The new Ultimo collection offers gorgeous lingerie for every 
occasion and I can't wait for women try it.

'We've been working 
tirelessly over the past year to improve our product range and fit - 
including our famous ‘OMG' Plunge bra, which is now 50 per cent lighter -
 and I believe that Ultimo now offers the very best fit on the market.'

Abbey
 said: 'I'm thrilled to be the new face and body of Ultimo, following in
 the footsteps of so many gorgeous women. The new collection is 
beautiful and all about celebrating your body. My favourite piece from 
the range is Ultimo ‘Hallie', which gives incredible cleavage and looks 
really luxurious on the skin - I just love it.

Speaking
 about her top lingerie tips, Abbey said: 'My top lingerie tip would be 
to invest in two lingerie drawers - one for everyday, comfy lingerie and
 the other for more luxurious styles for those special occasions.'

Michelle
 added: 'It is very exciting times for Ultimo. We've made major 
improvements to our product and taken a more directional approach. 
Abbey's debut Ultimo campaign reflects this change in direction, further
 cementing Ultimo's position as one of the UK's best loved lingerie 
brands.'

Ultimo’s heritage is built on enhancing the female form, with a specific focus on cleavage boosting and uplift.

The
 brand’s very first design, the ‘OMG Plunge Bra’ with in-built silicone,
 was worn by Julia Roberts to create her cleavage in Erin Brockovich.

Since then, Ultimo has seen the likes of Mel B, Penny Lancaster, Rachel Hunter and Sarah Harding pose for them, and the brand has grown to be one of the UK's most recognised lingerie brands famous for its body-enhancing products.

This January, the brand reported their strongest online December sales in its 16-year history from their direct website ultimo.co.uk.

 first Ultimo shoot will reflect this change in direction, further 
cementing Ultimo’s position as one of the UK’s best loved lingerie

Michael Buble's Argentine wife, Luisana 
Lopilato celebrated her last ever Ultimo campaign in December as she 
retired to focus on motherhood.

Welcome to the family! Ultimo Founder Michelle Mone OBE (L) is delighted to announce Abbey Clancy as the new 'face and body' of her lingerie brand

Speaking
 about Abbey's new appointment in December, Michelle said: 
'I’m delighted to announce that Abbey is the new face and body of 
Ultimo. She’s a modern beauty, feminine and fashion-forward, which perfectly reflects our forthcoming Spring/Summer collection.'

Abbey said at the time: 'It’s really 
exciting to be part of such an established brand at such an exciting 
time. I absolutely love the Ultimo product – it’s so wearable and feels amazing on the body!'
