These pictures show the shocking slide into extremism of Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary from a London rapper to a brutal jihadist suspected of beheading a U.S. journalist.

Bary - nicknamed 'Jihadi John' - was a rising star who performed under the name L Jinny before leaving his parents' £1million home in Maida Vale to fight in Syria.

Now an album of pictures has emerged showing his fall from grace.

'Vengeful extremist': Others images show Bary's gradual slide into extremism including this one apparently showing the 23-year-old former lyricist in military fatigues and a mask wihle wielding a machine gun

Early shots show him wearing western labels such as Adidas hoodies as he raps in the studio, while another shot shows him squaring up to riot police.

Later images show the former lyricist in military fatigues and a mask wielding a machine gun, an AK-47 and an M16 assault rifle.

The pictures come from a Facebook page dating back to 2012 which is now believed to have been removed.

In posts alongside the images he attacks 'western propaganda' and wrote: 'Shame on you Muslims that are embarrassed of mujahids/jihads...'

'Slide into radicalism': Bary is one of three British men who have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed U.S. journalist James Foley in a brutal propaganda video

In another post he added: 'Those who strive to defend the lives and freedom of helpless women and children are branded as blackguards, extremists, Islamists and terrorists.'

Bary is one of three British men who have emerged as potential identities for the masked extremist who killed James Foley in a brutal propaganda video.

The men, all in their early twenties, are thought to be in the IS capital of Raqqa, Syria.

The fighter, who spoke with a British accent, butchered the U.S. journalist, claiming it was in retaliation for U.S. air strikes on the Islamic State.

A French prisoner who was held captive by 'John' says he was part of a group of British jihadists who call themselves 'The Beatles'.

Bary, 23, Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, have been mooted as identities for 'John'.

According to reports in The Sun newspaper, some of the men have similar voices and even use similar language to that used in the video.

An expert told the Sun that Bary's voice and speech patterns sounded 'the same' as those of the man speaking in the horrific video of Mr Foley's death.

Bary has previously posted sickening images online of himself posing with the severed heard of a Syria soldier, accompanied by a joke.

Friends say Bary became radicalised after coming into contact with extremists linked to hate preacher Anjem Choudary.

A former friend said: 'He had the talent - he could have been as big as Dizzee Rascal. He was doing music with huge names in the underground scene.

'People have got into his head - it's transformed a talented young guy into a vengeful extremist.'
