But after getting him to safety, she was then swept into the rough seas off Twilight Bay in Esperance.

Mr Myall jumped back into the sea in an attempt to save her but, after reaching her,Â  she showed no signs of life.

Speaking to The Press, her father, Anthony Harris, said he was initially angry his daughter had died over a fishing rod which fell in the water.

But he added: 'However, I don't harbour any ill-will towards him [Kegan]. He did all that he could and he just couldn't save her.

'She loved him and that's all that mattered.'

Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Mr Myall's mother Sheri, said her son blamed himself for his fiancee's death.

He told her that he wasn't strong enough.

'It was a simple accident' said Ms Myall. 'They were fishing and Kegan slipped in and Andrea went down to assist pulling him out and slipped herself," she said.

'Kegan did his best to save her, but it wasn't possible.'

The couple - described as soulmates, met six years ago and were planning to save money in Perth before heading back to Christchurch in New Zealand to start a family.

They had been travelling across Australia in a caravan before the accident occurred on May 26.
