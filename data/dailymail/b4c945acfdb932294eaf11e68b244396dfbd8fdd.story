A Michigan teenager 
who wanted to raise awareness about cerebral palsy by walking 40 miles 
with his younger brother strapped to his back battled heat, rain, 
fatigue and more to finish the trek Sunday.

Hunter
 Gandee, 14, had been planning for weeks to pull off the walk, hoping to
 put a face on the muscular disorder that prevents his 7-year-old 
sibling, Braden, from being able to walk without help. But all his 
organizing couldn't prepare him for the conditions he faced as he packed
 the 50-pound boy over two days.

He even thought about giving up along the way.

Incredible: 14-year-old Hunter Gandee walked 40 miles with his 7-year-old brother Braden Gandees on his back

Swagger: The walk was called the 'Cerebral Palsy Swagger' to raise awareness about the disease that affects Braden

'Honestly,
 yes, there was a point that we did consider stopping,' Hunter said. 'Braden's legs - the chafing was getting pretty bad. We did have to 
consider stopping. It was at about the 30-mile point.'

A phone call changed all that.

Hunter
 reached out to a friend, who said a prayer for the brothers. That, 
combined with some rest and a change in how Braden was positioned on his
 brother's back, helped the boys make it the final 10 miles.

It
 may have taken a bit longer than they anticipated, but the Gandees and 
more than a dozen of their family members and friends strolled up a 
winding road Sunday toward the University of Michigan's wrestling 
center.

At the top of the hill, Hunter lifted 
up Braden so he could touch a 'Go Blue' banner erected for them near the
 walk's endpoint. The move was met with thunderous applause and cheers 
from those who had gathered to see the boys finish the trek.  

Tough: The boy's almost had to stop because of chafing on Braden's legs caused by the way he was situated on his brother's back, but the tough 7-year-old powered through it

Asked how he felt, Braden replied simply: 'Tired.'

Hunter said he was 'more tired than I think I've ever been. My legs are pretty sore. But we pushed through it. And we're here.'

More
 than 30 hours earlier, Hunter, with Braden securely strapped to his 
back, left the parking lot of Bedford Junior High in Temperance near the
 Ohio border. Just before their Saturday morning departure, well-wishers
 packed the gym for a send-off and the school band performed.

The boys' parents and two other siblings accompanied them on the walk. A caravan of cars and other walkers also joined in.

The
 goal of the walk, called the Cerebral Palsy Swagger, was to raise 
awareness about cerebral palsy and hopefully inspire new ideas for 
mobility aides and medical procedures.

Braden typically uses a walker, braces or a power chair to get around.

Touching: Hunter says he walked so far with his brother on his back to show Braden how much he appreciated him being there for him

Finished! After a grueling 40 miles on his brother's back, Braden celebrates with friends and family

Hunter,
 a 155-pound wrestler, said he trained for the trek by lifting weights 
and staying active. And by checking the weather forecast.

Saturday was warm and sunny, but Sunday was cool and rainy. The boys were prepared, though, and packed a variety of outerwear.

By
 the time Sunday afternoon arrived, the rain had subsided and they 
completed their triumphant march into Ann Arbor under sunny skies.

For Hunter, the walk was about doing something for his brother.

'I
 can't even describe to you how special (Braden) is to me. I can't put 
it into words,' the teen said. 'He's awesome. He's always there for me. I
 really just wanted to give back to him in some way.'
