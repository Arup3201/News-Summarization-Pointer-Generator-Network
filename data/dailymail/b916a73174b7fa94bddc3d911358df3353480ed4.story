His home is crammed with piles of papers, books, toys on armchairs and clothes and ornaments on every available space. 

But Arthur Watson is determined to maintain the notion that a man's home is his castle - and no bureaucrat can take away his possessions.

The 66-year-old has recently been served with a council notice to clear his Plymouth home of clutter because of health and safety concerns, but he has refused - claiming their direction breaks the Magna Carta.

Arthur Watson has been ordered to remove rubbish and clean up his Plymouth home, but the 66-year-old hoarder claims the council order is breaching his rights which are enshrined in the 1215 Magna Carta and he should be allowed to keep hold of all of his collection 

Mr Watson claims he was visited by police and Plymouth City Council who had a warrant because they believed his house was a public health hazard. 

He was then issued with an 'abatement notice' which ordered him to remove food waste and thoroughly clean his flat in Estover, as well as get rid of all rubbish.

He told the Plymouth Herald: 'I think I have complied with most of that.

'It just seems unnecessary, a waste of public money.

'I can't see that I am a threat to public health. There's no vermin here. It's not unhygienic.'

Mr Watson has accused the council of breaching article 39 of the Magna Carta, drawn up in 1215. 

Rooms in Mr Watson's flat are crammed full of his possessions, with piles of books and paper seen on sofas and chairs as well as on the floor

Every surface is covered with items Mr Watson has collected, with clothes and trinkets strewn on a bed and flags and banners on the walls 

The pensioner has vast piles of photographs and letters which litter the floor, shelves and tables of his home but wants to keep them all

This states that: 'No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.' 

'Disseised' means 'removed' and Mr Watson claims this covers the possessions in his home, and said there had been no legal hearing of his case and his rights are therefore being breached.

The rooms of his flat are packed with items, with clocks on chairs and banners and number plates on the walls. In the kitchen dozens of pots, pans and plates are stacked around the sink, with no space on any surface.  

The pensioner disputes claims his home and vast array of hoarded items could be a health and safety hazard and said it is hygienic and safe

Mr Watson lives in a flat in Plymouth where he has filled rooms fit to bursting with items he has collected including books and papers

Books, papers, bags and signs abound throughout the home and were seen by Environmental Health officers who were 'not pleased' with it

Under normal council rules householders are given a set period of time to clear up their property until police may be called to enforce it

Plymouth City Council said an abatement notice may be issued by Environmental Health Officers when they are concerned about the hygiene and cleanliness of a property. 

A spokesman said: 'The council may give the householder a period of time with a deadline, in which to clean their house.

'If the householder fails to improve in the period of time given by the court, the council will take further action and in some instances, involve the police where necessary.'

Previously researchers from the Institute of Living, Hartford, Connecticut, found that people with hoarding disorder have abnormal activity in regions of their brains which affect decision making and can lead them to choose not to throw items away.
