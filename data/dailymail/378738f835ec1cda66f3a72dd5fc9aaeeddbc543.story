A secret East German-style rescue package is being cooked up by Germany as the eurozone's 'engine-room' desperately bids to save the single currency.

German chancellor Angela Merkel is preparing a six-point plan that aims to revive Greece in the same way East Germany was developed after the fall of Communism.

Der Spiegel reports that it will see ailing countries transformed through privatisations, soft investment rules and the relaxation of employment laws.

Hit: France, led by Francois Hollande (left), and Germany, led by Angela Merkel (right) are usually known as the engine-room of the eurozone, but are now also suffering from the economic slowdown

The European Union will be presented with the plan, including a proposal for a European privatisation agency or fund, in the next few weeks.

It is likely to provoke outrage in Greece because of it's 'behave more like the Germans' message.

It is modelled on the 'trust agency' Treuhandanstalt, created in 1990 by the People’s Chamber of East Germany to sell off 8,500 state enterprises.

Merkel also wants to create special economic zones that will tempt foreign investors with tax relief and reduced regulation.

The employment market would also be restructured along German lines, with a job protection loosened.

The leaking of the plans comes as it was revealed France and Germany, dubbed the eurozone's engine-room, is now being hit by Europe's economic slowdown.

Worry: The news that Germany and France is also suffering from the economic slowdown gives added urgency to the region's struggle to keep Greece's debt crisis from tearing the single currency apart

So far, the 17-nation bloc's downturn has been confined mainly to its periphery - with Greece, Portugal and Ireland all seeking bailouts.

But an index measuring broad economic activity across the monetary union in May showed its weakest outcome since mid-2009, during the global financial crisis.  

It has given added urgency to the region's struggle to keep Greece's debt crisis from tearing the single currency apart.

Greece's general election on June 17 has turned into a referendum on whether Athens should continue with an austerity drive that is the price of continued fiscal support from its euro partners.        

Greece's anti-bailout leftist SYRIZA party is maintaining a lead ahead of the elections, according to an opinion poll yesterday.

Greece held elections on May 6 but that vote left parliament divided evenly between groups of parties that support and oppose austerity conditions attached to a €130billion rescue agreed with lenders in March.  

The Public Issue/Skai TV poll showed SYRIZA leading with 30 per cent of the vote, four points ahead of the conservative New Democracy party, which is backing the bailout.

If repeated on June 17, this would fall short of enabling SYRIZA to govern alone but give it a decisive role in forming a new government.               

Greece's deficit means that without the EU/IMF money, which would stop flowing if Athens were to tear up the agreement on reforms, it would not be able to pay salaries and would have to leave the eurozone and start printing its own currency.    

'Regardless of the turmoil and the debate that's going on in these crucial countries, it would seem that for the time being, people want to stick with the euro,' said John Wright, senior vice president of global public affairs at Ipsos.         

Yesterday's composite PMI indicated core nations such as Germany and France were also being caught up in the downturn.

This was as they made contingency plans to deal with financial and economic turmoil in the event Greece quits the euro.          

Italy, which could be on the front line of speculative attacks on euro markets if Greece went back to the drachma, put a brave face on the situation, saying the most probable outcome was still that Greece would remain in the euro zone.       

'Anything can happen, but I think the most probable outcome is the one which is most positive for Greece and for all of us,' Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti told Italian TV.

He said Greece's eurozone partners had been wrong to insist on overly rapid reforms and fiscal adjustment, and he did not expect it would be long before European countries were ready to introduce common euro zone bonds.             

'Italy is very much in favour of the creation of euro bonds when the time is right, and we do not expect it to be too far off,' Monti told an earlier news conference.     

At least half of eurozone governments, as well as banks and large companies, are making contingency plans in case Greece decides to quit the euro.

Despite Monti's comments, his deputy economy minister said Rome was ready for such a possibility.      

And European markets are currently stable.

The FTSE-100 is 0.05 per cent up at 5,352.93; France's CAC 40 is 0.41 per cent up at 3,050.58; and Germany's DAX is 0.43 per cent at 6,343.35.

It came as yesterday the euro crashed to a 22-month low as the European economy took another dramatic turn for the worse.

Figures showed the biggest slump in private sector business across Europe this month for nearly three years. The dire news sent the euro tumbling against the dollar to $1.25 – its lowest level since July 2010. Against the pound it was worth little more than 80p.

Figures from financial research group Markit showed the eurozone economy sank deeper into the mire this month. In Germany, the private sector was in decline for the first time in six months while in France the slump was the steepest for just over three years.

Common euro bonds, which would allow weaker nations like Greece to borrow with the collective backing of the bloc, have been placed back on the agenda as Greece's possible exit looms larger.

And the topic has seemingly split France and Germany. France's election on May 6 of a Socialist president, Francois Hollande, has changed the tone of the debate on euro bonds.

He urged a reluctant German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders at talks on Wednesday to consider recourse to euro bonds among other measures.    

Merkel, seen as an architect of the austerity prescription for Greece, now looks increasingly vulnerable on the eurozone crisis. Other European leaders have rallied around Hollande's call for a new emphasis on growth alongside debt-cutting.     

Surprise: Meanwhile, away from the eurozone crisis, French President Francois Hollande made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan today

Trip: Hollande visited some of the French troops he wanted to pull out later this year  

On euro bonds, Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SDP) and Greens have taken a similar line to Hollande. But there were signs yesterday they might instead accept a compromise plan to mutualise only a proportion of members' sovereign debts.     

This would involve mutualising the debts of euro zone countries beyond 60 percent of GDP.               

The euro crisis has also thrown a spotlight on the vulnerability of commercial banks to a full-blown crisis of confidence in the single currency, especially in the indebted countries of southern Europe, such as Spain.     

Spain is considering creating a single nationalised bank out of its failed lenders, including problem lender Bankia, if the state cannot find buyers for state-rescued banks, a senior Economy Ministry source said.

Bankia, which was part-nationalised just two weeks ago, is also to ask Madrid for £12billion in bailout cash.

Meanwhile, away from the eurozone crisis, French President Francois Hollande made an unannounced trip to Afghanistan today.

He visited some of the French troops he wants to pull out later this year and meet Afghan President Hamid Karzai, whom he saw briefly last week in Chicago.   

Hollande, making a whirl of foreign trips since his May 15 inauguration, is accelerating the withdrawal of the roughly 3,400 French troops still stationed in Afghanistan to the end of this year, two years ahead of the NATO timetable.   

His office said he would pledge to keep to a long-term cooperation treaty signed with Kabul earlier this year.   

Hollande's new withdrawal timetable is at odds with NATO partners adhering to a plan to hand over command of all combat missions to Afghan forces by the middle of 2013 and withdraw most of the 130,000 foreign troops there by the end of 2014.
