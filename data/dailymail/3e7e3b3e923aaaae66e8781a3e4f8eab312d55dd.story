A mother-of-two has told how her husband's illness motivated her to lose 11-stone in six months.

Tabby Shaw, 40, tipped the scales at 20 stone but when her partner John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes she decided to tackle her life-long weight problem.

In a bid to avoid developing the same condition as her husband, which is often linked to obesity, Tabby met with a dieting consultant and started following a strict meal plan.

Tabby Shaw, 40, tipped the scales at 20st but after six months of dieting the mother-of two weighs 9st

Now six months on, without the help of a gastric band or weight loss surgery, Tabby has discovered a new lease of life.

Weighing just nine stone and now a slim size 12, the office worker from Redditch, Worcestershire,  is barely recognisable.

Delighted with her svelte figure she said: 'I was always a big girl. I was larger than my school friends and then an even larger adult.

'But now I’ll walk past a mirror and 
I’ll have to stop and check it’s really me.

Tabby used to gorge in secret, snacking on cakes and biscuits, and indulged in giant portions three times a day

By the age of ten Tabby was ten stone and after having two children she was 20st 9lb (left) but today she is a lot happier and is determined to stick to a healthier lifestyle

'When you’ve always been as 
big as I have being slim takes some getting used to.

'I’ve also found that men find me 
much more attractive which is a revelation. I’ve never felt so good or had so much energy.'

Tabby had always battled with her body image. Aged ten she weighed ten stone and after having two children she was 20st 9lb.

She gorged in secret, snacking on cakes and biscuits, while indulging in giant portions three times a day.

Cruel jeers from strangers only added to her feelings of self-loathing.

But after John's diagnosis, and not wanting her two daughters Mary, 17, 
and Ester ,15, to be burdened with two seriously ill parents she decided
to turn her life around.

She said: 'My husband John was diagnosed with diabetes when he was 40 and by the time I reached 39 I knew there was a real possibility that I could develop it too.

'I didn’t want my kids to have two parents with a life limiting disease so last year I decided that I was going to do something about it.

'I had a meeting with a dieting consultant on New Year’s Eve and made it my New Year’s resolution to lose the weight.'

After reaching her ideal weight in December, Tabby remains determined to maintain a healthier lifestyle.

'I used make massive roasts for the family every Sunday. I’d make enough for ten at least, even though there was only four of us.

'When I was dieting I’d still make the roasts but I was only allowed a plate of vegetables and if were having chicken I was allowed a tiny bit of meat.'

Tabby lost weight on the Cambridge Diet Plan, on which she ate two liquid meals a day and one small evening meal. It is considered by some medical experts as an extreme weight loss solution, as it can cause the body to burn muscle mass as well as fat.

Tabby added: 'I never thought I’d be able to lose this much weight naturally, but I managed it. My message is that you don’t need to resort to drastic measures to lose weight, if I can do it anyone can.'

Diabetes is a long-term condition caused by too much glucose in the blood and affects an estimated 2.8 million people in the UK.
