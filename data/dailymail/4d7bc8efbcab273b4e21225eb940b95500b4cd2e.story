These dramatic photographs show the moment a sex attacker clambered onto a roof and threatened to throw himself off during a 14-hour stand-off with police.

Derek Johnston, 39, has been jailed for 11 years after breaking into the house and attempting to rape a woman who was inside with her children.

He was forced to flee out of the bathroom window and onto the roof when the victim's mother arrived at the home.

Officers sealed off surrounding streets while negotiators on a crane desperately tried to coax him down in baking 27C (80F) heat.

Police stood down as darkness fell and returned to the property in the early hours - only to find he had vanished.

Officers finally found him hiding under a bed in the same house, in Southampton, Hampshire, the following day.

Johnston broke into the home, hid in the garage, and pounced as his victim was using a washing machine, Southampton Crown Court heard.

He held his hand around her throat before trying to rape her, as her children played upstairs.It was only when the woman's mother arrived that the victim managed to bite Johnston's hand, cry out for help, and get away.

He made his escape as the woman's mother escorted the children out of the house, on July 9 last year.

In a video recording played to the court, the woman said: ‘I thought he was going to kill me.

‘I could hear my children running around upstairs and I thought I would be lying dead downstairs and no one would know.’

Johnston, of no fixed address, denied attempted rape and two counts of sexual assault but was convicted at trial.

Prosecutor Rachel Robertson said the victim had been subjected to a ‘sustained’ attack.

And she added: ‘There was an element of planning and lying in wait.’

The court also heard how Johnston had attacked the same woman the previous April.

On that occasion, he went into her bedroom and sexually assaulted her twice.

Elizabeth Bussey-Jones, defending, said Johnston did not represent a high or substantial risk of reoffending and added: ‘He bitterly regrets it.’

But Judge Peter Henry branded Johnston ‘violent’ and ‘intimidating’.

And he told him: ‘You remained hiding in the house for hours on end listening and waiting and then attacked her.

‘The only reason that you didn't rape her is that her mother appeared at the door and she screamed out.’

He branded the roof stand-off and subsequent hiding as ‘bizarre’.

Judge Henry imposed a restraining order preventing Johnston from entering a large area of Southampton and ordered him to pay 120 pounds into a fund for victims of crime.
