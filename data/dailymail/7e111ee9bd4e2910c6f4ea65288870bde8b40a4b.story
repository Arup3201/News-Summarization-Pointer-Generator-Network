Catalan Dragons scrum-half Sam Williams is to rejoin Canberra Raiders following the French club's capture of Todd Carney.

The 23-year-old Williams joined the Dragons on a short-term deal from St George Illawarra in June with a view to earning a long-term contract but is now headed back to the club at which his career began.

Williams has played in nine of their last 11 matches but the anticipated arrival of Carney on a three-year deal means there will be no place for Williams at Stade Gilbert Brutus, where Thomas Bosc and Scott Dureau, who returned to Australia this summer to complete his recovery from injury, will compete for the scrum-half role.

Williams, who has signed a two-year deal with the Raiders, will make his final appearance for the Dragons if they lose their elimination play-off at Leeds on Saturday.

'Sam is a gifted playmaker who we believe will be a valuable asset for our squad,' said Raiders recruitment and high-performance manager David Hamilton.

Williams played 42 first-grade matches for the Raiders before moving to St George in 2013.

'The Raiders are my home club with some of my best mates and a club I've always wanted to see successful so I'd love to be a part of any success we have in the future,' Williams said.

Meanwhile, the Catalans are waiting for the Rugby Football League's board of directors to formally give the green light for them to register the 28-year-old Carney, who was de-registered by the NRL in June following a breach of discipline with Cronulla.

Carney has previously been moved on from Canberra and the Sydney Roosters.
