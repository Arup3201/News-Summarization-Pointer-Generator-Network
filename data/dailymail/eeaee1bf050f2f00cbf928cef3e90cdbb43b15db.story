Due to the United States government shutdown which went into effect on Oct.1, NASA's website is not publishing daily information.

NASA is experiencing at 97 per cent workforce cut.

'Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available.,'says the site.

The website is known for updating visitors on the status of Mars and is famous for uploading an image a day from space called Astronomy Picture of the Day.

Since users can't get their photo fix from NASA's site, they are getting it from Other sources.

The European Space Agency (ESA) is up and running and has been posting pictures from space, proving that the federal government shutdown isn't universal.

Kazakhstans Mangistau region east of the Caspian Sea: water and wetlands, with eroded areas at the top and on the right. The majority of the image is dominated by flatland covered with low-lying vegetation

Thirsty Land: Africa¿s Okavango River empties into the inland Okavango Delta in northern Botswana

Clearwater Lakes in Canada¿s Quebec province: what appears to be two separate lakes is actually a single body of water that fills two depressions

Namib Desert: The blue and white area is the dry river bed of the Tsauchab, black dots of vegetation are concentrated close to the rivers main route, while salt deposits appear bright white

Chernozem Cropland:The area is part of Russia¿s Black Earth Region, a strip of land across multiple regions that is known for its black soil called chernozem

Greenland Fjords:Long fjords reach far inland and, zooming in on the tips of some of their 'fingers', we can see ice streams that drain the Greenland ice sheet

Raystown Lake: 'home of the Lochness Monster,'Near the top of the lake ¿ which appears as a snaking red and blue line in this image ¿ there is a bright white radar reflection from the Raystown Dam

Belize Barrier Reef: In the upper-central part of the image, an underwater sinkhole known as the Great Blue Hole appears as a dark blue circle

Sahara Oasis: The city can be seen in in the upper left corner, while large, irrigated agricultural plots appear like Braille across the image

Equateur:The DR Congo has the largest extent of tropical rainforest in Africa, but its precious ecosystem is constantly threatened by deforestation
