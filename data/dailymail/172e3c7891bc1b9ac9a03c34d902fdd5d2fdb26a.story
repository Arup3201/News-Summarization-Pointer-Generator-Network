The website that became ground zero for the nude photos hacking scandal has announced a ban on all naked or sexual images posted without consent.

Reddit, the sprawling, user-run forum site which brands itself 'the front page of the internet', will impose the ban next month.

It comes months after the site was criticized for openly directing users to pornographic hacked images of the likes of Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton on a dedicated page set up to spread them.

Victims: Kate Upton, left, and Jennifer Lawrence, were the highest-profile victims of the nude hacking scandal, images from which Reddit allowed on its forums. Lawrence in particular hit back against everyone who shared, viewed and hosted the pictures, saying they were complicit in a 'sex crime' against her

'Front page of the internet': Reddit, shown above, has 160million users and a history of lax policing on its site. It admitted that it 'missed the chance' to act when the photos first leaked

While the company eventually closed the section down, thousands of people had already accessed the images, generating huge ad revenues for Reddit in the process.

Under the new rules, effective from March 10, all images of any person either naked, aroused or having sex which are posted by the site's 160million users without consent are banned.

Anything which is posted will be removed, Reddit said, and potential victims were given a contact address to flag any banned posts.

Previous rules had banned only child pornography, and content perceived to be spam - though volunteer moderators could also remove items if they chose. 

In a post signed by Reddit's interim CEO Ellen Pao, she acknowledged that the site 'missed the chance' to act decisively while the nude photos leaks was happening.

She said: 'No matter who you are, if a photograph, video, or digital image of you in a state of nudity, sexual excitement, or engaged in any act of sexual conduct, is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission, it is prohibited on reddit.'

The photo leak drew a furious reaction from the celebrities featured, many of whom confirmed that the images were legitimate.

Lawrence in particular was strident in her criticism of the leaks, which began last August.

She said anybody involved in spreading the pictures was complicit in a 'sex crime' against her and should 'cower in shame'.

It comes at the same time as Google announced its Blogger service would also enact a blanket ban on all pornographic posts later this month.

From March 23, any sexually explicit or 'graphic nude' images will be removed from public view, and the account owners will find their sites switched to a invite-only mode.

Nude pictures which are 'artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific contexts' will not be included in the ban.

Social media sites have varying policies on nudity. Facebook prohibits images containing nudity altogether, which has enraged some mothers banned from sharing pictures of them breastfeeding their children. 

Twitter doesn't mediate legal content but recommends that content with nudity or violence be marked as sensitive. It also lets users flag questionable content for review.
