Embattled rancher Cliven Bundy must be held accountable for his role in a 'Wild West' standoff between his supporters and police last April over a land dispute, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has said.

Bundy, the last rancher in Clark County, Nevada, has been battling the BLM since 1993 when he refused to pay for the right to graze on the 600,000-acre Gold Butte land he says his family have owned since the 1870s.

The BLM says Bundy 
owes over $1 million in fees and penalties for trespassing on federal 
property without a permit over 20 years, claiming he is destroying the arid and fragile 
habitat of the endangered desert tortoise.

The row culminated in April when more than 200 armed federal agents and snipers were deployed to the ranch to forcibly capture nearly 1,000 of his cattle.

Standoff: Bundy, the last rancher in Clark County, Nevada, has been battling the BLM since 1993 when he refused to pay for the right to graze on the 600,000-acre Gold Butte land he says his family have owned since the 1870s. He today spoke at a prayer ceremony at a supporter camp located near the Virgin River Sunday

But authorities were forced to retreat after his rag-tag militia of armed anti-federalists refused to back down.

Clark
 County Sheriff Doug Gillespie today said Bundy crossed the line when he
 allowed states' rights supporters, including self-proclaimed militia 
members, onto his property to aim guns at police.

'If
 you step over that line, there are consequences to those actions,' 
Gillespie told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'And I believe they stepped
 over that line. No doubt about it. They need to be held accountable for
 it.'

Bureau spokeswoman Celia Boddington, in a statement released Saturday to The Associated Press, agreed, saying the agency continues to pursue the matter 'aggressively through the legal system.'

'There is an ongoing investigation and we are working diligently to ensure that those who broke the law are held accountable,' she said, declining to elaborate.

The FBI declined comment Saturday on its investigation. Bundy did not respond to a request for comment.

A federal judge in Las Vegas first ordered Bundy in 1998 to remove 'trespass cattle' from land the bureau declared a refuge for the endangered desert tortoise. Bureau officials obtained court orders last year allowing the roundup.

Boddington disputed Gillespie's contention the agency mishandled the roundup of Bundy's cattle 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas.

The bureau backed down during the showdown with Bundy and his armed supporters, citing safety concerns, and released some 380 Bundy cattle collected during a weeklong operation from a vast arid range half the size of the state of Delaware.

Gillespie blamed the bureau for escalating the conflict and ignoring his advice to delay the roundup after he had a confrontational meeting with Bundy's children a few weeks before it began.

'I came back from that saying, 'This is not the time to do this,' the sheriff told the Review-Journal. 'They said, 'We do this all the time. We know what we're doing. We hear what you're saying, but we're moving forward.''

Tensions further escalated early in the roundup after a video showed one of Bundy's sons being stunned with a Taser. The video drew militia members and others to Bundy's ranch.

Bundy was not a hardened criminal, Gillespie told the newspaper. He was a rancher who stopped paying his fees, the sheriff said, and that was not worth risking violence.

But Boddington said the bureau planned and conducted the roundup in 'full coordination' with Gillespie and his office.

'It is unfortunate that the sheriff is now attempting to rewrite the details of what occurred, including his claims that the BLM did not share accurate information,' she said. 'The sheriff encouraged the operation and promised to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with us as we enforced two recent federal court orders.'

'Sadly, he backed out of his commitment shortly before the operation - and after months of joint planning - leaving the BLM and the National Park Service to handle the crowd control that the sheriff previously committed to handling,' she added.
