Calls for the Government to ditch its plans to raise the motorway speed limit were dismissed yesterday.

The M5 crash led to safety campaigners urging the Coalition to abandon plans to increase the 70mph limit to 80mph.

But drivers' groups immediately accused them of 'circling like vultures over the M5 dead' and Transport Secretary Justine Greening insisted it was too early to say whether speed caused the pile-up.

Tragedy: As the stretch of the M5 reopened today after the 34 car pile up, safety campaigners and driving groups have become embroiled in a war of words over speed limits

Aftermath: As a fingertip search was conducted yesterday, safety campaigners called for the Coalition to abandon plans to increase speed limits

'Some people have said the weather was particularly bad,' she said. 'What we need to do now is focus on what's happening to the people who have been injured. We'll have a debate about the policy issues in the coming weeks.'

But Jo Bullock, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'We have said from the beginning that we would not support an increase in the speed limit.

'Higher speed means less time for 
drivers to react to what's going on around them. Our concern is that 
there will be more serious accidents.'

And Ellen Booth, senior campaigns
officer at Brake said: 'Government policy should not be doing anything 
to increase the number of man-made, unnatural deaths occurring.'

Tragedy: Was speed an issue? In the days after the accident safety campaigners and drivers' groups have been at odds over the crash

Fireball: Fire crews from Devon and Somerset Fire Brigade tackling a blaze on Friday evening, since the crash a war of words has erupted over 80mph speed limits

'Like a war zone': The mangled vehicles at the crash scene on Saturday as police worked to clear the wreckage. 51 people were injured and seven killed in the 34 vehicle pile-up

Too early: Transport Secretary Justine Greening said it is not yet clear if speed was the cause of the pile up

But Brian Gregory, Chairman of the Association of British Drivers, issued a press release under the title 'Road Safety Charities Are Like Circling Vultures Over M5 Dead'. He said: 'Accidents aren't caused by a “number on a pole” and the M5 disaster will be shown to be no exception.

'It is clear that the accident involved a number of HGVs limited to 56mph and below, plus there are question marks over the wisdom of holding a firework display adjacent to the motorway.'

Tory MP Margot James agreed there shouldn't be a rush to judgment. 'We don't know how fast people were driving.

'I don't think people were driving that fast anyway, from the reports I've heard from the people interviewed who survived the accident. So I'm not sure it was the speed that was causing the problem.'

A full risk assessment is needed of measures to increase the maximum motorway speed limit from 70mph to 80mph, a motoring group said today.

Today, the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) called on the Government to pilot an 80mph limit on a controlled and managed motorway 'to assess its practicality and safety and road users' reaction'.

IAM chief executive Simon Best said: 'A fifth of motorway-users already travel at this increased speed, and more than half exceed 72mph when they can, suggesting that a properly controlled 80mph limit may not show huge increases in carbon or road casualties.

'A detailed trial is needed to assess these risks though, and if they are shown to increase significantly, of course a better-enforced 70 limit may be a more appropriate system.'

Blame: Ian Gregory, Chairman of the Association of British Drivers, said: 'Accidents aren't caused by a ''number on a poll'' and the M5 disaster will be shown to be no exception

He went on: 'Raising the motorway 
speed limit has been debated for many years, and the evidence is that 
the motoring public are ready for it. The Transport Secretary should now
publish a consultation with firm proposals.'

Earlier this autumn the then 
transport secretary Philip Hammond announced that the Government would 
be launching a consultation on raising the limit to 80mph.

He said the current speed limit was 
nearly 50 years old and was out of date thanks to huge advances in 
safety and motoring technology.

Mr Hammond said an increase to 80mph 
would generate economic benefits of hundreds of millions of pounds 
through shorter journey times.
