Sportsmail has launched a campaign to stamp out the wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling in the penalty area that's ruining our game. 

Here's what they're all saying about it in the world of football:

Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo both appear to grapple Branislav Ivanovic and John Terry of Chelsea

John Terry - Chelsea captain

‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’

Colin Pascoe - Liverpool assistant manager

‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’

Ian Wright, ex-Arsenal striker 

‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’

Graham Poll - Former top referee

‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’

Martin Keown - Ex-Arsenal defender

‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’

Martin Keown developed a strategy for dealing with players like Nesta when he encountered them with Arsenal

Micky Mellon - Shrewsbury Town manager

‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’

Ryan Shawcross of Stoke was rightly penalised for wrestling Swansea striker Wilfried Bony to the ground during last weekend's match at the Britannia Stadium

And the readers of MailOnline...

‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath

‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester
