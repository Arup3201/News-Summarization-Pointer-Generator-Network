Risk: Eloise Coulson, pictured with her convicted husband, could lose the property in Preston Kent 

For eight months she has endured the humiliation of her husband’s disgrace and revelations about his affair with Rebekah Brooks.

Now Eloise Coulson could face losing her family’s home as the prosecution seek to recoup almost £750,000 in costs for the phone hacking trial.

The Crown Prosecution Service spent £1.7million bringing Andy Coulson, Mrs Brooks and four others to trial.

Coulson, 46, is hoping to force his former employers in the Rupert Murdoch media empire to pay his share but if he fails the CPS has said it would look to his ‘assets’ to recover its costs.

It is understood they could include his family home in Preston, Kent, which he shares with his wife and three young sons.

The couple have already sold their £1.5million five-bedroom Victorian home in Forest Hill, South London, after he was charged, and downsized to a £600,000 house near Canterbury. Mrs Coulson, 42, accompanied Coulson to court regularly during the eight-month trial but has not been seen at his side at the Old Bailey since his conviction last week.

Coulson – who earned a reported £475,000-a-year as the Conservatives’ director of communications – is also facing a retrial on allegations he made corrupt payments to public officials.

He and Mrs Brooks began an affair in 1998 and admitted it had been rekindled at least twice after his marriage to PR consultant Eloise in 2000.

Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said: ‘Mr Coulson has a number of assets which have a financial value. One of them is an indemnity.’

Coulson’s ‘indemnity’ from his ex-employers News International, now News UK, means the firm has been forced to pay his legal bills. 

He took them to court in August 2011 after they stopped the payments and he successfully argued they had a legal duty to continue to cover his legal fees.

It is not clear if the firm will have to cover his share of the CPS costs, or any ongoing legal fees. Costs are due to be decided in a two-day hearing later this month.

So far, only news editor James Weatherup has been ordered to pay a £5,000 share of prosecution costs.

A legal source said it would be unusual for a family home to be seized to cover CPS costs, but said the cost of the trial was unusually high.

Meanwhile, Mrs Brooks, her husband Charlie, her former assistant Cheryl Carter, former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner and News International security chief Mark Hanna have all asked for their defence costs to be paid by public funds after they were all acquitted.
