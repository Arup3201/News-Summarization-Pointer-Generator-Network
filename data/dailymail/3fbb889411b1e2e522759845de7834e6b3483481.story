Emily now feels it was a mistake and she made a bad decision

They seemed to have a blissful marriage filled with kids, reality TV and happy photo ops.

But on Tuesday, UsWeekly reported there's a serious crack in the marriage of Dean McDermott, 47, and Tori Spelling, 40.

Emily Goodhand, 28, has alleged the former hunk slept with her after an alcohol-fueled evening in Toronto, Canada on December 6. 'He was romantic and very complimentary. He was telling me, "You're so beautiful,"' Emily told the magazine. 'And he told me he and Tori had a sexless marriage. I believed him.'

Reps for Tori and Dean did not return calls to MailOnline.

Bombshell: Emily Goodhand, 28, told the January 6 issue of UsWeekly she slept with Tori's husband on December 6 in a Toronto hotel room

The one-night-stand allegedly took place after a group of friends met up at Pravda Vodka House in the Canadian city, where Dean was on a promotional tour for his hosting job on the show Chopped Canada.

Emily was a friend of a friend and the two were introduced. Her occupation was not disclosed.

The father invited the beauty back to the Fairmont Royal York Hotel where they had sex, according to UsWeekly.

'He seemed like a cool guy,' Emily said. 'I thought he was handsome.'

They became friendly over an eight hour meal at Pravda, sitting side by side. 'We were just having fun and hanging out,' Emily added.

When heading toward the bar at his hotel, 'he was flirting,' she added, and she explained she was attracted to him because his personality was 'very charming.'

The 5'8" looker explained she felt she could 'trust' him because he opened up to her and was 'talking about his kids and his work.'

She also said they knew a lot of the same people, 'so we had that in common.'

During drinks at his Fairmont hotel, the 6'3" former hunk did not openly flirt with Emily as there were other friends with them.

But later the two exchanged phone numbers, then he slipped his card key with his room number into her purse.

'We just looked at each other,' Emily said.

After slyly leaving with friends and making it seem as if she was going home, Emily instead went to Dean's hotel room. At first he wasn't there but then she texted him and he showed up within seconds.

'He wanted to make me feel good,' she explained after he flooded her with compliments. 'Then the time for talking was over.'

Emily, who insisted they used protection during their encounter, said Dean gushed about his famous wife.

'He said, "I love my wife, I love her so much. But she won't sleep with me,"' Emily recounted.

She then said she had to go home to get a good night's sleep and he asked that they 'cuddle' first.

The next day both worked but texted each other. She told him her legs hurt.

The next evening - December 7 - she visited the TV star again at the Fairmont Hotel, but this time he had a male pal there.

And instead of taking off his clothes, he took out his computer where he showed off photos of Tori and the kids. At one point he even bragged about the sex tape he made with his author spouse.

Emily, who has never seen Tori's hit TV series Beverly Hills, 90210, said she did not want to see the tape.

At 3am they shared a club sandwich and fries then fell asleep. This time there was no hanky panky, just cuddling.

'It felt cool that I had this connection,' Emily told the weekly.

'Neither one of us said anything about seeing each other again. It was, "Nice to meet you. Crazy that there was this chemistry. I had a great time,' she added.

Emily is now feeling bad about the hook up. 'I f***ed up,' she told UsWeekly.

Meanwhile, on December 7 Tori - who has sons Liam, aged six, and Finn, 16 months, as well as daughters Stella, aged five, and Hattie, aged two, with Dean - was talking glowingly about Dean.

'We do date night once a week,' the Lifetime favorite said.

'We're into public displays of affection.'

The weekly points out that Tori has expressed insecurity about Dean in the past because he left his first wife of 12 years, Mary Jo Eustace (with whom he had a son and a newly adopted girl) during their 2005 affair on the movie Mind Over Murder.

In 2012 there were reports he cheated with two women which almost led to a split. Later she admitted they were 'fighting a lot.'

Cracks also showed when her book Spelling It Like It Is came out and unveiled their financial troubles.

'Dean felt like it made them look like idiots,' a source told the magazine.

The timing couldn't be any worse. They have their new reality show Tori & Dean: Cabin Fever coming out in 2014 on HGTV. She also is starting a new TV series Mystery Girls with 90210 alum Jennie Garth, 41.

She also has her lifestyle web site Torispelling.com to plug. 'Tori is the breadwinner,' added the source.
