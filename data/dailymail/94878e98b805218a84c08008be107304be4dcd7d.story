Adnan Januzaj, James Wilson and Paddy McNair turned out for Manchester United's Under 21 side on Monday night.

The trio were hoping to force their way into Louis van Gaal's plans by impressing against Everton at Southport's Haig Avenue.

Man United striker James Wilson scored but then hobbled off before half-time

Wilson opened the scoring in the eighth minute by firing home the rebound after Andreas Pereira's shot had been parried by keeper Russell Griffiths.

But the striker was forced off in the 40th minute after failing to shake off the effects of a heavy challenge early on in the match.

Paddy McNair (L) celebrated Northern Ireland call-up by scoring against Everton

McNair, called up by Northern Ireland for their matches against Scotland and Finland later this month, doubled United's advantage just before half-time when a clearance fell to the defender and he lobbed the ball into an unguarded net.

Jonjoe Kenny scored a late consolation from the penalty spot for Everton but the Reds held out for a hard-earned success. 

The 2-1 victory consolidated top spot in the Barclays Under-21 Premier League table.
