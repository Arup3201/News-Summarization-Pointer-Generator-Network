The Star Wars saga famously unfolds in 'a galaxy far far away', but filming for the latest instalment in the movie franchise looks set to take place in a less than exotic location.

Shooting for Star Wars VII, which is set to start in the summer, will take place in the shadow of a suburban shopping centre.

A disused quarry overlooking Kent's sprawling Bluewater complex is thought to have been earmarked as a location for battle scenes from the new film.

The site next to the shopping centre has previously been used as a location to shoot scenes from the Doctor Who television series.

'Doctor Who has been filmed there and it can easily replicate other planets,' a source told the Sun newspaper.

'They'll just have to make sure they don't include the shopping centre in any shots.'

Filmmaker JJ Abrams was announced by Disney as the director of the highly-anticipated new film - scheduled for release in 2015, this week.

The news raised eyebrows among sci-fi fans, as Abrams is already attached to the rival Star Trek franchise.
