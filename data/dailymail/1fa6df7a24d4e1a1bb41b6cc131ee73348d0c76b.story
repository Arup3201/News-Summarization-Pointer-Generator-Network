A porn star who wants to create a national day for 'self pleasure' is standing as a candidate in the Toronto mayoral race - just days after the city's controversial mayor checked himself into rehab.

X-rated starlet Nikki Benz announced she wanted to stand for mayor, amid news that Rob Ford had taken a break from his election campaign to treat his substance abuse.

The Toronto-born entertainer, who has been promoting her campaign on Twitter, has already released an election campaign video, which has had more than 35,000 views on YouTube.

Nikki Benz has announced she will stand in the 2014 Toronto mayoral race - just days after mayor Rob Ford took a break from his campaign to check into rehab

In the video, she tells viewers she has 'high concerns' about the city's management and says Torontonians need someone 'who understands and exudes transparency'.

She then tells viewers: 'You can 
search my positions — but only if you're over 18.'

Benz, who is backed by her porn company employers Brazzers, has not yet filed her official nomination but has vowed to do so on May 28  - National Masturbation Day.

But she has already used the cheeky video to tell would-be voters about her policies, including her idea to turn Toronto’s light rail into a 'Brazzers Pleasure Rail,' complete with vibrating seats for women and sex toys for men.

She says she would also start a National Masturbation Month, which would include a day's national holiday to celebrate 'self pleasure'.

Referring to Ford's admission that he has taken drugs, she says: 'Orgasms make for happy, 
healthy people, unlike other vices - not to take a crack at anyone 
here.'

The actress, who has starred in films such as 'Pump Fiction', also tells viewers that she is in favour of Pride - something which stands her apart from Ford.

She says she wants the world to know Toronto is 'an open-minded city promoting equality'.

Benz's announcement is the latest twist in an election campaign which has been filled with drama.

Just last week, Mr Ford went to rehab at an undisclosed location for at least 30 days - the day after reports emerged of a second video which appeared to show him puffing from a crack pipe.

His decision to seek treatment came months after he announced he was finished with alcohol — only for more reports of drunken behaviour to emerge.

The scandal over Ford's crack use started last May when a first video showed him smoking the drug.

After police said they had obtained that video, Ford admitted that he had used crack in a 'drunken stupor'.

Ford - who has not been charged with any crime - has not abandoned his bid to seek a second term in the October 27 election.

But observers say the revelation of a second video could ruin his chances of success.

Ford, who said he was '100 per cent committed to getting myself right', was elected four years ago on a wave of support from Toronto's suburbs.

He honed in on conservative voters with promises to slash spending, keep taxes low and end what he called 'the war on the car'.

But his tenure has been overshadowed by controversy, making him a national embarrassment for many voters.

Ford has refused to resign, despite mounting pressure after a string of incidents - from public drunkenness 
to an appearance in another video that showed him threatening 'murder' 
in an incoherent rant.

Toronto's city council has stripped him of most 
of his powers.

Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly is now in charge
 of the city, but he had already assumed most of the powers that were 
stripped of Ford last year.

In a statement last week, before leaving the city for rehab, Ford said: 'I have a problem with alcohol, and the choices I have made while under the influence.

'I have tried to deal with these issues by myself over the past year. I know that I need professional help and I am now 100 per cent committed to getting myself right.'
