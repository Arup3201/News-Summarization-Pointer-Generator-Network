It’s a company famous for offering many fringe health benefits for employees, such as an on-site gym, fitness classes and a bike repair man.

But one New York City woman believes Google might be too concerned about its employees' lifestyle choices, by discriminating against fat people.

She was one of seven overweight women escorted out of an interview day with 20 participants at lunch, whilst everyone who stayed was thin.

Overweight worries: One New York City woman believes Google might be discriminating against fat people in its recruitment process

Google has vigorously denied claims of size discrimination by issuing a flat-out statement that it does not discriminate in its hiring process.

But the unidentified woman, who had already passed a phone interview, thought there was discrimination during the test, reported the Jezebel blog.

She claimed the phone interview was mostly about her out-of-work activities and got the impression Google wanted to see she is active.

Two of the three questions she took in the exam contained fitness-based logic questions about running and personal training.

The seven rejected women ‘kind of looked at each other’ in the lift after they were escorted out, the woman told Jezebel.

One girl had tears in her eyes and that's when I realised (the human resources official) separated out the fatties.’

Discrimination against overweight people in the workplace has previously been the subject of lawsuits brought under a disabilities act.

But a Google spokesman told Jezebel: ‘We don't discriminate in our hiring process.’
