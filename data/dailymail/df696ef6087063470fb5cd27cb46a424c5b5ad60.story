The CEO of Motorola is in line for a $65 million bonus following the company's merger with Google.

Sanjay Jha, 48, was named chief executive of the cell phone company in January after being brought in to salvage a business that lost $4.3 billion between 2007 and 2009.

Mr Jha's huge windfall comes a day after it was revealed that Eugene M Isenberg, 81, chairman and  chief executive of
oil-drilling company Nabors Industries
Ltd, will receive a $100 million pay out - even though he isn't leaving the company. 

Bonus time: CEO Sanjay Jha is in line for a $65 million windfall despite his company Motorola Mobility recently announcing the loss of 800 jobs worldwide

Shareholders have been left furious as Mr Isenberg's gilded exit is worth more than the entire company made in his last quarter as CEO.

Brandon Rees, deputy director for the AFL-CIO’s office of investment, which owns Nabors shares told Fuelfix.com: 'It defies logic. We’re baffled by what the board of directors was thinking in negotiating such an agreement for a CEO who is of retirement age.

'Nabors will continue to be a focus of shareholder discontent.'

In the case of Mr Jha, the deal is likely to be less controversial with investors because mergers often increase share prices.

In the Motorola deal, stock and stock options account for more than $52 million of Mr Jha's potential payout, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The chief executive's pay packet topped $13 million last year.

The firm also recently announced the loss of 800 jobs worldwide before the end of the year.

Motorola did not comment to MailOnline.

Sanjay Jha was born in the city of 
Sultanganj, India and studied engineering at the University of 
Strathclyde in Scotland followed by the University of Liverpool.

He worked at San Diego-based Qualcomm 
for 14 years. When he left, he was president of the wireless giant’s 
chip set division and chief operating officer.

The
multi-millionaire married in 1991 and lives in San Diego with his wife 
and three sons but commutes to Motorola’s Chicago headquarters during 
the week.

Sweet deal: Eugene M Isenberg, 81, who lives in Palm Beach, walks away with $100 million in severance pay from oil company Nabors but will stay on as chairman

It was announced last week that oil company boss Mr Isenberg would be promoting his second in command, 57-year-old Anthony G. Petrello, to CEO of the Bermuda-based company, but
that he would also remain in his job as chairman. 

The power shift means that a clause in Mr Isenberg's employment contract will give him $100 million.

The amount is less than he was originally entitled to, $264 million, after shareholders complained several years ago about the exorbitant sum.

Mr Isenberg, who is already worth $750 million, would not have been entitled to the payout had he retired or resigned.

The 81-year-old lives in Palm Beach, 
Florida and has commuted to the company's operational headquarters in 
Austin, Texas. He also has homes in New York and Martha's Vineyard.

The company has refused to comment to MailOnline on when Mr Isenberg will receive his payout.

In 2009, the Corporate Library listed Mr Isenberg as one of the highest paid, worst performing U.S. executives. In 2011, Nabors stock fell 19 per cent.

In a statement on his company's website, Mr Isenberg said: 'I have complete 
confidence that Tony is the right person to take over as CEO.

'We have 
worked closely together for 20 years, and he has a deep knowledge of the
Company's operations and strategy.

'He is well positioned to lead the 
Company as CEO moving forward. I believe the Company's brightest and 
most successful days are ahead of it.'

Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance, told the Wall Street Journal: 'I think shareholders will have some issues.

'From an outside standpoint this doesn't seem to be a severance event.'

Eugene Isenberg has been in charge of Nabors since 1987 when the company, which was started in Alaska, was coming back from bankruptcy.

He began his career at another oil and gas company Exxon and was formerly head of a steel trading company Genimar Inc.

He has served as Governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers from 1998 to 2006 and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) until 2005.

He is also the President of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Foundation and a major donor to the college where he was once a student.

His successor Anthony Petrello, who attended Harvard law school, has been on the board of directors at Nabors since 1991. 

Last year, the company had a net income of $300 million. The Nabors companies own 491 land drilling rigs
and 749 well-servicing rigs in the U.S and participate in most of the significant oil and gas markets in the world.

Earlier this year the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted rules concerning shareholder approval of compensation for company executives and so-called 'golden parachute' arrangements.

From January 2011, the new rules say that 'say-on-pay' votes for shareholders must take place every three years.

However the SEC also adopted a temporary exemption for smaller companies which will not be required to abide by the voting rules until 2013.
