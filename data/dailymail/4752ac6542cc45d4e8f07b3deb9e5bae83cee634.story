A pedigree puppy bought as a present was crushed to death in a reclining chair in a tragic accident.

Devastated owners Lynsey Smith and Paul Gardner were heartbroken when they found the dog.

Mr Gardner spent £1,000 on the Chihuahua, called Tillie, as a present for his girlfriend Miss Smith, 21, who was getting over the loss of her grandad.

Anguish: The tiny dog had crawled inside the back of the reclining chair and became caught in the reclining mechanism

But the puppy was killed aged just 14 weeks after it crawled into the back of an electrical reclining chair, used by her mother Charlotte Smith as an aide for standing up.

Mr Gardner, 20, an upholsterer, said the gap at the back of the chair was large enough for a child to crawl under and was unsafe.

The chair was supplied by Medequip, who provide community equipment services, in October as part of a contract with Barnet Council.

Shock: Mr Gardner believes that Tillie was only underneath the chair for a few moments before she got crushed in the hydraulics

The couple say they were 'devastated' by their loss, and want to warn other dog owners about the chair's dangers.

Mr Gardner, from Barnet, North London, said: ‘On Wednesday night we couldn’t find Tillie, and were looking everywhere for her. Then we looked under the reclining chair and saw that she had been crushed.

‘We’re both shocked and devastated. Tillie could have only been underneath it for a few moments. Someone must have moved the chair and she got crushed in the hydraulics. I just can’t believe that this has happened.

‘I’m an upholsterer and I’ve never seen a chair designed as badly. There’s a Velcro flap about ten inches up and 15 inches wide. A small child could easily crawl inside it.

‘Behind the flap there’s a hydraulic pump and bars which move up and down. Tillie was a lovely dog, she’s irreplaceable. If we spent £1 million, we would never find another dog like her again.

‘Lynsey was really close to Tillie.'

Miss Smith said that the dog had been well looked after, and that the chair should be made safer with proper warnings given to prevent a similar tragedy happening again.

'We are all devastated that our puppy has passed, she was a member of our family,' she said.

A Barnet Council spokesman said: ‘We are very sorry to hear about this sad case. Medequip supply recliner chairs such as these on behalf of the council, and as part of the service demonstrate how to use each piece of equipment.

‘They also leave information and guidance notes with the customer, which includes a warning to be careful of small pets.’

A spokesman for Medequip said that they were investigating the issue.
