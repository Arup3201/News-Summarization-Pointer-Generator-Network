Jailed: Brian Harrison, 31, was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 16 years behind bars

A fisherman has been jailed for life for murdering a grandfather who died almost two years after being attacked in the street.

Brian Harrison, 31, was originally jailed in 2008 for leaving Neville Dunn in a permanent semi-conscious state and requiring round-the-clock care.

But the victim died 22 months after being beaten on New Year's Eve in 2007 - so Harrison was put back on trial for murder.

Yesterday he was given a minimum term of 16 years behind bars, four years after the original attack in Penzance, Cornwall, by a judge sitting at Truro Crown Court.

Harrison had his sentence backdated to January 1, 2008, the date he was arrested for the original attack, meaning he will serve an additional 12 years for the murder.

The defendant, an amphetamine-user, carried out the attack because he wrongly believed fellow fisherman Mr Dunn, 44, had raped his girlfriend after he admitted having a one-night stand with her.

Mr Dunn's family branded his killer 'disgusting' for smirking at them during the trial and treating it as a 'one big hilarious joke'.

Mr Justice Burnett, sentencing Harrison, lambasted the killer for showing no remorse for the attack and for his attitude towards Mr Dunn's family in the public gallery during his week-long trial while some witnesses gave emotional evidence.

Victim: Neville Dunn who died almost two years after being attacked on New Year's Eve 2007

'You have caused immense damage to a large number of people,' he said.

'Kirsty Dunn (Neville's daughter) says you smirked at her during this trial, as you did at times in your first trial.

'It was clear to me during the course of this trial that you were enjoying the discomfort of several of the witnesses during this trial.

'There is no remorse in this case. You told (a friend) after the attack that Neville got what he deserved. I have seen nothing that tells me you have changed this view.'

He added: 'It is clear that you did not set out on the morning of December 31 2007 to injure Neville Dunn in the way which occurred. But once you started your attack it was deliberate, vicious and repeated. You had every opportunity to stop.

'This was an attack of extreme violence committed while under the influence of, at least, amphetamines.'

Mr Dunn died in October 2009 - 22 months after the attack.

Harrison was able to stand trial a second time because the Law Reform (Year and a Day Rule) Act 1996 scrapped the 'year and a day rule' which stated that an action was presumed not to have caused a person's death if more than a year and a day elapsed between it occurring and their death.
