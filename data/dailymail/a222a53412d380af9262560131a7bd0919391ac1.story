Beyonce is one of the world's most scrutinized pop stars, and now that study is moving to academia.

The Department of Women's and Gender Studies at Rutgers University, New Jersey, is offering a course called Politicizing Beyonce, which examines 'American race, gender, and sexual politics.'

Kevin Allred, a doctoral student who is teaching the class, told Rutgers Today: 'This isn't a course about Beyonce's political engagement or how many times she performed during President Obama's inauguration weekend.'

Serious study: Beyonce at the Grammy Awards. Rutgers University, New Jersey, is now offering a course called Politicizing Beyonce, which examines 'American race, gender, and sexual politics'

The class supplements an analysis of Beyonce's videos and lyrics with readings from black feminists. Allred says he's seeking to help students think more critically about media consumption.

His course will focus on the star who has number of alter-egos as a performer, role model, fashion designer, mother and wife.

'She certainly pushes boundaries,' Allred said. 'While other artists are simply releasing music, she’s creating a grand narrative around her life, her career, and her persona.'

The lecturer will only assign readings by black feminist writers on his course, such as bell hooks, Alice Walker and Sojourner Truth.

Alter-egos: Beyonce performs at the 2013 Superbowl. 'She certainly pushes boundaries,' Allred said. 'While other artists are simply releasing music, she¿s creating a grand narrative around her life, her career, and her persona.'

Allred explained that he discovered the work of these women in the library while growing up in Utah. 'Their work resonated with me in ways that other content hadn't,' Allred said.

'I found myself identifying with their writing because racism, sexism, homophobia, and privilege are larger systems under which we all operate,' he added.

Rutgers also has a class examining the theology of Bruce Springsteen's lyrics.

Georgetown University has a class called The Sociology of Hip-Hop: The Urban Theodicy of Jay-Z, focusing on Beyonce's rapper husband.
