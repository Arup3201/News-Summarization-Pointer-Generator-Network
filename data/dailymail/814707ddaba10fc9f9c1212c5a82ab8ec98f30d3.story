As Oscars fever has gripped the world over the past fortnight, here at Sportsmail we have come up with our own set of accolades in the Academy Awards spirit.

Including stellar performances from Arsene Wenger on the touchline, Louis Van Gaal and his long-ball dossier and David Moyes trying to speak Spanish, to name but a few, we have looked back over the season so far and come up with the best displays in football.

The results are below. And the winner is…

Arsene Wenger pushes Jose Mourinho in the chest during Chelsea's 2-0 win against Arsenal last year

Best technical area tantrum: Arsene Wenger 

The clash was more akin to outside a boozer after a heavy Saturday night than on the touchline in one of the biggest fixtures of the calendar.

A furious Arsene Wenger stunned everyone when he stormed over and shoved Jose Mourinho in the Stamford Bridge technical area during the first half of Arsenal’ s defeat against Chelsea earlier in the season.

It was like years of pent-up rage had finally burst out of the usually serene Frenchman.

Fourth official Jon Moss acted as the bouncer and had to step in-between them as the pair squared up to each other.

Best press conference rant: Louis van Gaal 

You could barely have made it up if you tried. Manchester United manager Louis Van Gaal had his ego pricked by West Ham boss Sam Allardyce accusing his team of long-ball tactics and responded by arriving at his next press conference armed with a small dossier complete with pages of blue and red allows explaining why his team, in fact, did not simply lump the ball up the pitch now.

It evoked memories of Rafael Benitez’s infamous ‘facts’ rant at then-United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in 2009.

The reaction of the United press officer as she grimaced after handing out the sheets of paper was priceless.

Best foreign-language film: David Moyes 

This was fantastically cringeworthy. David Moyes, newly-appointed as Real Sociedad manager, was asked about his knowledge of their reserve team in a press conference.

Moyes had been in Spain for little less than a month and had clearly picked up a bit of the lingo. ‘I know the B-Team, I know some of the players,’ he replied. ‘They have been training with me… uno, dos, tres, cuatro… umm… times… but I’ve not seen them play.’ 

It’s hard not to watch the video over and over again once you have seen it for the first time. Moyes was widely mocked for it, but hats off for giving the language a go.

Best comment: Gary Neville

The chemistry between Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville on Monday Night Football was dynamite from the start.

In their first show together, Neville was explaining how hard it is to mark Robin van Persie by comparing him to a burglar in your house who you can’t find.

‘That’s the big problem for centre-backs,’ Neville said. ‘He’s a bit like a burglar in your house you don’t know which room he’s in.’ Carragher hit back with: ‘You’d be under the bed.’ 

Before Neville floors him by replying: ‘You’d probably be the burglar.’ Carragher almost choked on his water.

Best swan dive: Gary Cahill 

‘It’s like something out of Swan Lake,’ was opposition manager Steve Bruce’s take on Gary Cahill’s theatrical dive against Hull.

 In Chelsea’s 2-0 win back in December Cahill, already on a yellow card, flicked the ball between Tom Huddlestone and David Meyler then followed it through, legs spreadeagled and arms flailing. 

There was clearly no contact from the Hull players. Referee Chris Foy did not give a penalty but also failed to book the player. Bravo for that performance.

Best supporting actor: Nemanja Matic

As Chelsea have lead the way out-front at the top of the Premier League table everyone’s been talking about Eden Hazard, Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Oscar, Willian, John Terry, Thibaut Courtois. 

But it is Nemanja Matic who has been lurking in the shadows, pulling the strings for the side. They’ve only lost one game out of 37 with him in the side, and two out of three without.

It is for this statistic alone that he deserves the best supporting actor award.

Achievement in make-up and hairstyling: Alex Song 

GQ Magazine voted West Ham’s Alex Song the 10th worst-dressed man of 2014. The midfielder has a sensational wardrobe. 

Top hats, sunglasses, pink trainers, full yellow tracksuits, boots, ties, denim dungarees, long sleeves, short sleeves, no sleeves. He likes accessories and short hair and long hair and dyed hair.

It really is hard to keep up with his changing fashions and unusual tastes on a daily basis.
