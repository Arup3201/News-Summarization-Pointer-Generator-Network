The new film about Dominique Strauss-Kahn depicts the former International Monetary Fund chief as a sex-crazed playboy, haunting orgies and chasing young women - despite the objections of his wife.

A trailer, leaked online and posted by several websites, appears to be a film festival sales pitch the controversial movie starring Gerard Depardieu.

Depardieu plays a 'Mr Deveraux' - modeled after the powerful French politician, who was once a front-runner to become the president of France.

The very adult-themed trailer offers several scenes of Depardieu's character engaging in orgies, having sex with prostitutes and seducing young women.

All the while his wife, played by Jaqueline Bisset, struggles to cope with her husband's infidelities.

The trailer opens with director Abel Ferrara's recreation of the alleged sex assault that brought down the mighty DSK and led to his arrest in May 2011.

A woman behind a closed door screams and struggles, shouting 'No! No!'

Strauss-Kahn was dramatically taken off a plane and handcuffed after a maid at the upscale Sofitel New York Hotel accused him forcing her to give him oral sex.

The charges were later dropped due to inconsistencies in the maid's story to police, but the incident led to other accusations about Strauss-Kahn sexual predilections that sank his political career.

The film remains controversial because the sex assault charges were never proven and prosecutors determined that they did not have enough evidence to prosecute him.

That didn't stop Ferrara from imaging his own scenario for the incident at the hotel. The final scene of the trailer shows Depardieu's character wrapped in a bath towel, fresh out of the shower, when the maid approaches.

In an interview with Swiss Television RTS last year, Depardieu revealed he agreed to play the part because he found his fellow countryman 'arrogant and smug', adding: 'He is very French. I will do it, because I don't like him.'

Depardieu will be joined on screen by  Nip/Truck actress Jacqueline Bisset, who will play DSK's ex-wife, the French TV reporter Anne Sinclair.

And last month, the actors got caught 
in controlled chaos as they re-enacted the media storm surrounding the 
sexual assault trial, that ultimately collapsed in August 2011.

The scene depicted the media frenzy 
surrounding the case that was sparked when an immigrant hotel maid 
accused the then-IMF chief of sexual assault after she entered his suite
 to clean it.

It was filmed outside the same 6,800-square-foot, $50,000-a-month Tribeca townhouse 
that DSK stayed in while under house arrest as the case unfolded.

But the trial collapsed in August 2011
 when prosecutors deemed the evidence of his accuser, Nafissatou Diallo,
 to be unrelieble. She later filed a civil lawsuit.

The film is being directed by American Abel Ferrara, whose credits include Bad Lieutenant, which starred Billy-Bob Thornton in 1992 and 1996 crime thriller The Funeral, fronted by Christopher Walken.

Announcing his latest venture last year, Ferrara said it would be set in New York, Paris and Washington, adding: '[It will be set] in all spots of power in fact: it’s a film about rich and powerful people.'

Depardieu himself is no stranger to the courts.

Earlier this month, the Green Card actor missed a hearing in Paris over an alleged drunken scooter incident.

The 64-year-old actor, who also 
failed to attend court for the last hearing in January, was more than 
three times over the drink-drive limit when he came off his moped near 
the Champs-Elysees in Paris last November.

He had been due to attend a 
'correctional tribunal' in Paris to face a charge of drink-driving, but 
he did not turn up because he was filming his new role as 
Dominique Strauss-Kahn in New York.

A judge said the case would go ahead 
in Depardieu's absence, and the Oscar-nominated star of Green Card and 
Cyrano de Bergerac risked being sentenced to a maximum of two years 
behind bars and a £3,500 (Euro 4,500) fine.

Two years ago, Depardieu was also arrested for smashing up a car parked outside a swingers' club near his Paris home.

And
 he was involved in a separate scandal in France in 2011 when he 
urinated in the aisle of a plane in full view of disgusted passengers.

He also courted controversy in his native France this year
 after moving to Belgium and taking Russian citizenship to avoid a new 
75 per cent tax rate.

When Depardieu announced his plans to
 move abroad to avoid paying high tax rates, he was branded 'shabby and 
unpatriotic' by prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.

But the defiant screen legend retaliated 
by declaring he would also hand back his French passport, and wrote an 
angry open letter to the French government, saying: 'All those who have 
left France have not been insulted as I have been.'

He then told French president Francois Hollande in a personal phone call that he was 'sickened at how France spits on success'.

Depardieu is one of the few French stars known throughout the world, and has made more than 100 films, many in English.

He also notorious in France for his battle with alcohol and his turbulent love life.

Over the past ten years he has devoted much of his time to producing wine at his Lys-de-Volan vineyard near Lyon.
