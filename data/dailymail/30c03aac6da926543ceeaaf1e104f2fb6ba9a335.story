Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee says gay marriage is akin to alcohol and profanity — options the Republican weighing a 2016 presidential bid says are appealing to others, but not to him.

Huckabee on Sunday also told CNN's 'State of the Union' that forcing people of faith to accept gay marriage as policy is on par with telling Jews that they must serve 'bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.' That dish would run afoul of kosher rules.

'We're so sensitive to make sure that we don't offend certain religions but then we act like Christians can't have the convictions that they've had for over 2,000 years,' Huckabee added.

Huckabee says he appreciates different viewpoints on gay marriage, adding that he is friends with gay people.

'People can be my friends who have lifestyles that are not necessarily my lifestyles. I don't shut people out of my circle or out of my life because they have a different point of view,' Huckabee explained. 'I don't drink alcohol but a lot of my friends - maybe most of them - do. I don't use profanity but believe me, I've got a lot of friends who do.'

Huckabee has made cultural issues the cornerstone of his likely presidential bid. The former Baptist pastor is counting on social conservatives and evangelicals who have great clout in early nominating Iowa to help his bid.

When asked if the rising tide of support for gay marriage should lead to more Republicans backing legalization in the party - Huckabee said he wasn't opposed as long as the party doesn't  'change its overall view'. 

If he ends up running for the Republican nomination, it will be his second shot at the White House. Huckabee launched a failed campaign to get the Republican nod in 2008, but lost out to Arizona Senator John McCain.
