The third, and final, supermoon of the summer lit up the sky last night, with stunning new photos showing the beauty of this rare occurrence.

These moons are caused when a full or new moon coincides with the Moon's closest approach to the Earth, also known as its perigee, the spot closest on its oval orbit.

This event occurred two other times this summer, on July 12 and August 10.

What a view: The final super moon of summer took place last night around sunset, seen here with the statue of the Virgin Mary on top the University of Notre Dame's golden dome

Approximately every 14th full moon is a supermoon.

As tonight's moon is also the full moon  that falls closest to the fall equinox, it is also a Harvest Moon.

This is actually the fourth supermoon of this year, with the first happening right off the bat, on January 1. 

Sadly though, it will be a long time before another one of these nights comes along, with the next supermoon happening on Sept. 28, 2015.
