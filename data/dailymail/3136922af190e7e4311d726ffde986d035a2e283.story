Ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft are helping reduce drunk driving arrests in some American cities, according to new data.

Analysis reveals an average 10 percent decrease in DUI arrests in Philadelphia, Seattle and San Francisco after the car sharing apps were introduced.

Observers say other factors may also be contributing to the decline, but add that people are less likely to drive home drunk if they have more transport options.

Data: Chief technology officer Nate Good analyzed Philadelphia crime data and found DUI arrests declined about 11 percent after various car services were launched

Blogger Nate Good, a chief technology officer of a Pittsburgh event ticketing company, analyzed data from Philadelphia's Uniform Crime 
Reporting system.

He found the average number of DUIs per month 
in Philadelphia decreased by 11 percent between April and December, 
2013.

The number of DUIs among drivers under the age of 30 saw an even 
higher decrease of 18.5 percent, according to his blog post.

Good, a self-described 'proponent of ride sharing services', noted that the decrease in DUIs coincided with the launch of Uber Black, Side Car and Uber X.

However he added as a disclaimer: 'As the famous adage goes, correlation does not equate to causation. There can always be other things in play here that are affecting these DUI trends.'

Analysis: In May, Uber said it estimated the entrance of the car service in Seattle caused the number of DUI arrests to decrease by more than 10%

Uber spokesman Taylor Bennett backed the findings, saying a reduction in drunk driving in American cities is an unintended but welcome benefit of the company's services.

'Uber started really just to connect riders and drivers. A byproduct of that, as we've seen, are these incredible social and economic impacts that we're seeing in different cities,' he told NBC Philadelphia.

'It's a very seamless and convenient way to get transportation on demand. You don't have to go stand on a corner at two in the morning waiting for a taxi and fumbling around for cash.'

Uber released its own analysis of local crime data in May showing a 10 percent reduction in DUI rates since Uber entered the Seattle market.

'While there is plenty of room to explore this topic in future studies,' Uber wrote online, 'the data confirms the intuitive claim, backed up by countless anecdotes, that potential drunk drivers will choose other options, like rides with Uber, when they are convenient, affordable, and readily available.'

Correlation: Analysts say the introduction of ride-share services such as Uber and Side Car in some American cities has helped reduce DUI arrests

Earlier this month, Washington Post journalists reported a similar decline in DUI arrests in San Francisco in 2013, using figures from the San Francisco Police Department

They noted Uber Black launched in June 2010, before various other ride-share services started up in 2012. In September 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission introduced regulations which legally recognized these services.

'As a company - this might sound pollyanish -Â  we talk about our service not being aimed at providing transportation, but at lowering crime rates in a city like Chicago,' Lyft spokesman David Estrada told Washington Post.

Meanwhile, momentum is growing around the country for the legalization of ride-car sharing services, including in Texas.

A group in Austin has started a petition calling for the introduction of Uber to provide more transportation options. The group also has a Facebook page called 'Stop Drunk Driving in Austin; Bring Uber/Lyft to the City'.
