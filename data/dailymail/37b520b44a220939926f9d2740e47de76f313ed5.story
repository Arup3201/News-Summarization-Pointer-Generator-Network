A women was motivated to dramatically transform her body after doctors warned that her huge size was hindering her chances of starting a family.

Siobhann O’Brien, 23, from Failsworth, joined a gym seven months ago to transform her body and kickstart a healthier life.

Today, the receptionist weighs 13st 8lb, a huge 
loss of six stone in only seven months, which includes an impressive 13 inches off her stomach, nine inches off her hips and a total of 12.5 
inches from her legs.

Having struggled with her weight since childhood, Siobhann found her 19st 10lb frame was impacting her health and daily life

Siobhann has now shed over six st through changing her diet and exercising (right in her old shorts)

Having always struggled with her weight, Siobhann was repeatedly sent to hospital dieticians as a child in an attempt to curb her weight gain, but to little effect.

'I was a real bread fiend. And I was never happy with just one thing, I would order lots of things just in case I wasn't satisfied.

'At work in my bag I would always have KitKats or crisps. I just always had food with me.'

Siobhann's stodgy, carbohydrate heavy diet saw her weight continue to rise as she got older, impacting her daily life.

Doctors advised Siobhann that her weight would prove problematic, especially as 
she had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome at the age of 
16.

Siobhann used to find even walking a struggle and used to often carry food with her in case she got hungry

Siobhann was so large that even basic tasks like getting dressed presented a challenge and she worried it was effecting her fertility

Now at 13st 8lb and going to the gym five times a week, Siobhann says she feels so much better

'I had a lot of back pain and even walking was an effort.

'Some days my boyfriend had to help me get dressed and put my socks on and I just thought "I'm only 23, why am I like this?"

'We had been trying on and off for five years to start a family and nothing was happening. I went to the doctor and he said my weight was playing a major part and that for each stone I lost, my fertility would increase.'

Of her transformation she recalls: 'One of my friends referred a Personal Trainer at a local gym. We had an initial meeting and talked about various goals and reasons why I wanted to start training.

'At my first weigh in I was horrified to see 19st 10lb on the scale with 48 per cent body fat!  My first session was agony, even simple things like stepping up and down on a box step was torture.

'The trainer then put me a full diet plan and even went shopping with me to educate me on the right foods to eat so I could implement this into my life.'

She added: 'Losing this weight is one of the hardest things that I have had to do, gruelling personal training sessions with Lee pushing me to my limits, sometimes I felt like crying and giving up but with determination and encouragement I managed to push on resulting in a massive transformation in my life.'

Breakfast: Lots of white bread with eggs or cheese ham and pickle sandwiches 

Lunch: French bread baguette with a mayonnaise based filling and a pasty or pie

Dinner: Large portion of homemade curry or creamy pasta with lots of cheese. Ready meal pudding

Snacks: KitKats and crisps

Breakfast: Porridge with fresh blueberries

Lunch: Chicken with sweet potato and green vegetables

Dinner: Chicken or tuna steak with a small portion of brown rice and broccoli

Snacks: A handful of nuts like almonds, yogurt or fresh fruit

Siobhann’s personal trainer and General Manager at PureGym Manchester Moston, Lee Greenall, says: 'It’s been terrific to see Siobhann’s change, her courage and will is inspiring and she’s a testament to what hard work and commitment can result in.

'It has been a pleasure to work with her and the whole team are looking forward to continuing to help Shiobhann realise her full potential.'

Shiobhan now eats a low carbohydrate, high protein diet and goes to the gym around five times a week, doing a wide variety of exercising.

'I feel so much better in myself, and my hair and skin are miles better. It's amazing how much of an impact diet can have on your life.'

Shiobhan now hopes to continue to lose weight before trying for a baby again soon.
