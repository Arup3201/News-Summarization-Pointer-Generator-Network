The BBC is managed by a group of men and women who are brilliant at three things.

The first — and easily the most important — is persuading their superiors their job is vital to the well-being of the Corporation even if no one is quite sure what that job actually is.

The title offers little help. The grander it is, the less it means — but it will almost certainly contain the words ‘strategic’, ‘governance’ or ‘director’. Preferably all three.

Parodying Auntie: Hugh Bonnevile and the cast of W1A, which BBC veteran John Humphrys has lauded

Their second is avoiding taking any  decision for which they can be held responsible.

They do this by surrounding themselves with clever young people who do all the work and get all the blame when something goes wrong.

If it goes right, naturally the director takes the credit.

And their third is to demonstrate by thought, word and deed their unswerving loyalty to the man at the top of the organisation: Baron Hall of Birkenhead.

John Humphrys, presenter for the Today programme on Radio 4, believes the BBC has always been over-managed

Not that he is ever accorded that title. He is referred to only as ‘Tony’, the better to give the impression they are the closest of friends and Tony hangs on their every word.

Their principal activity is holding endless meetings at which nothing is  decided, but a great deal of time  and coffee are consumed and an even greater deal of management jargon is spoken.

The more opaque and meaningless the jargon the better. That way, accountability can be avoided and responsibility ducked.

If no one really understands what the hell is going on, no one can be held to account for anything. Their contact with the real world beyond London W1A is limited, if not non-existent.

Now at this point dear reader (or should I address you as ‘dear licence-fee payer’?), you’ll be wondering why I, as a more or less loyal servant of the BBC, have decided to sign my professional death warrant with such a savage attack on the organisation that has provided me with a pretty decent living for nigh on 45 years.

The answer, as you may have guessed, is that the BBC I have described is a fictional organisation.

It is the creation of some clever scriptwriters for a new BBC2 comedy series beginning tonight and starring Hugh Bonneville as Ian Fletcher,  ‘Head of Values’ at the BBC.

The last time we saw Fletcher was in Twenty Twelve — that wicked satire on the people who brought us the Olympics.

This sequel is very funny, too, unless you are a BBC boss in real life.

In which case you might, perhaps, worry that your critics will view it more as fact than fiction.

You might also worry how the more humble mortals who work for the BBC, and have never risen through the ranks to breath the intoxicating air of the senior management corridors, will view it.

I’d be lying if I said there weren’t some of my colleagues who will be punching the air the morning after the programme is broadcast and shouting: ‘Spot on! They’ve got the bosses bang to rights!’

It would be odd if they didn’t.

Humphrys (pictured) believes that the BBC is no different from any organisation, arguing that many corporations have too many bosses and staff that think higher-ups are too overpaid

I doubt there is a large organisation anywhere in the world where senior management is loved by all (or even most) of its workers. Or where the workers do not think there are too many overpaid bosses.

Why should the BBC be any different?

I am on record as saying the BBC is over-managed. It always has been.

When I joined the BBC in the Sixties, I was told my patch would be the North-West of England and was ordered to set up my base in Liverpool.

I was to work out of Castle Chambers, an office building in the heart of the city, where the North-West Representative of the BBC was based.

The Representative (I can never think of him without the capital letter) was a dapper little fellow called Reg.

But only to his closest friends.

To young pond life like me, he was Major HRV Jordan Retd, JP, BA (Hon) and he was a very grand figure indeed.

Reg had an extremely large office with a well-stocked cocktail cabinet and two elegant young secretaries. Not one, you will note, but two. Their duties, it is fair to say, were not onerous.

'W1A' cast: (Left to Right) Simon Harwood (Jason Watkins), Siobhan Sharpe (Jessica Hynes), Tracey Pritchard (Monica Dolan), Ian Fletcher (Hugh Bonnevile), Will Humphries (Hugh Skinner), Lucy Freeman (Nina Sosanya), Anna Rampton (Sarah Parish)

Reg graced the office a couple of times a week to sign a few letters and occasionally drove up the coast to Blackpool for lunch with ‘my friend, the Mayor of Blackpool’ in his large plum- coloured Jaguar and white cotton driving gloves before returning to his home in the Wirral.

Perhaps Reg’s relationship with His Honour and one or two other municipal worthies in the North-West was, as he insisted, invaluable to the well-being of the BBC.

Whether it repaid the considerable sum forked out by the unwitting licence-payer is debatable.

And he was not alone. There were many of them here and abroad.

Our Representative in the United States, where I was later sent to open a television news bureau, had a far grander suite of offices in New York and an apartment in the UN Plaza with stunning views over the East River that would not have disgraced a Saudi prince.

All that was more than 30 years ago.

The Representatives have long since been given their marching orders and many similar anachronistic posts abolished — not, it must be said, without a fight.

The grand offices have gone, too.

Even some of the most senior bosses in New Broadcasting House must slum it with the rest of us.

But there are still plenty of places to hold meetings and Lord knows they are kept occupied.

The BBC bureaucracy is alive and kicking. And it’s not just me saying that. It’s Tony Hall, too.

One of the first trips he made when he became Director General was to the U.S. to see the Google and Apple operations.

Back in London, he wrote this: ‘To launch an initiative, one of our colleagues had to speak to two people at Google.

‘To get agreement to do the BBC’s first eBook, someone at the BBC had to speak to more than two dozen.’

There’s not a programme-maker in the BBC who wouldn’t say Amen! to that. Back in the Eighties, I returned from filming a famine in East Africa with some powerful material.

I rang the office of the controller of BBC1, Michael Grade, and asked his secretary if he could find the time to look at it because I thought it would make a decent documentary.

Half an hour later, I was sitting in Grade’s office. He put his feet on the desk and watched the first ten minutes.‘OK,’ he said. ‘I’ll get it scheduled for a few weeks’ time.’ And so it was.

That same process 30 years later would take many months and almost as many meetings as Eisenhower held to plan the D-Day landings.

Mercifully, Hall wants to change that. He says the BBC’s meeting culture ‘hampers creativity’.

He wants to halve the number of pan-BBC boards and steering groups — a ‘bonfire of the boards’, in his words — to speed up decision-making and ‘release some of the resources wasted on bureaucracy for programmes.’

Anyone who thinks it will happen overnight does not know the BBC.

Yet tonight’s programme is an encouraging sign. An organisation that can take the mickey out of its own management quite so ruthlessly shows it’s got the message.

And that’s a start.
