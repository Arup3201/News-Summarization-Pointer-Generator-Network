The Danish zoo that sparked international outrage after killing an 18-month-old giraffe and then dissecting it in public has drawn further criticism after euthanised four lions.

Copenhagen Zoo has said that two lions and their two cubs had to be put down to make way for a new male.

But the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has condemned the 'callous' action of the zoo, which, it said, brought the lions into the world only to 'bump them off'.

And now the zoo has said it ‘had to euthanise’ the two lions and their cubs - ‘who were not old enough to fend for themselves’.

According to The Guardian, the new male lion would have killed the ten-month-old cubs ‘as soon as he got the chance’.

After the zoo was unable to find a new home for the lions, all related, they were put down yesterday.

The zoo said the animals, unlike Marius, had not been killed and dissected in front of an audience.

A PETA spokesman said: 'Copenhagen Zoo, which pleads that there is nowhere to put these animals, didn't find them abandoned on the doorstep one morning – the zoo brought them into this world.

‘Like domesticated cats, big cats breed, unless you make sure that they are sterilised, and that is exactly what the zoo had an ethical obligation to do, rather than bringing cubs into the world simply to bump them off.

‘This callous action highlights the fact that zoo breeding programmes serve no conservation purpose, because animals born in zoos are rarely, if ever, returned to their natural homelands.

‘Instead, zoos spend millions on keeping animals on display like living museum exhibits and dispose of them when they become inconvenient or there are "too many" of one kind.’

It comes just over a month after Marius,
 a healthy young giraffe, was killed with a bolt gun before children 
were allowed to watch on as its body was cut up and fed to lions.

Marius was killed in February despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save him.

Young children stood at arm’s length as his carcass was skinned and dissected before the meat was thrown to the lions.

The zoo said the move was necessary to combat inbreeding and said the display was educational.

But animal rights campaigners condemned the killing of Marius, saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in Europe’s top zoos.

Marius’s plight had triggered worldwide outpourings of protest, including an offer to rehome him in Britain, with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a healthy animal.

Copenhagen Zoo said it was told by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) that Marius was genetically too similar to the other giraffes in its breeding programme.

Around a week after Marius was killed, the country passed a law banning the religious slaughter of animals for halal and kosher meat.

The law change drew criticism not only from those describing it as 'anti-Semitic' and 'a clear interference in religious freedom', but also from those who pointed to the seemingly hypocritical slaughter of Marius.

The Scandinavian country passed the law after years of campaigning.
