Britain's most prolific game show contestant has been honoured in the Guinness Book of Records for a career that saw him claim just a handful of prizes.

David St John, 65, from Cannock, Staffordshire, has appeared on game shows 34 times but has won only £5,000 after slipping to defeat on 25 occasions.

However, he has just been crowned with the official title of Most TV Quiz Appearances by the Guinness Book of World Records, for his glittering 30-year career.

Over the past 30 years he has appeared on 34 of the most popular quiz shows, including The Weakest Link, Eggheads, 15 to 1 and The Chase, and has had been crowned champion nine times.

The married grandfather-of-four started out as a quiz show newbie in 1982, on Sale of the Century, where he won the show and his first prize - two motorbikes.

He said: 'Out of all of the shows I’ve been on the most memorable was Sale of the Century. It is my favourite because it was my first - and they say you never forget your first.'

Mr St John, who works as a comedy entertainer doing gigs and events across the country, has met some quiz show greats during his career.

This has included Eggheads’ Daphne Fowler during the Australian version of Sale of the Century as well as the so-called 'Queen of Mean' Anne Robinson on The Weakest Link in 2001.

'I was most excited about meeting Bob Monkhouse on Wipeout in 1998. He was a comedy genius and one of my idols.'

He has also become well known due to his unchanging hair style over the years and has taken home around £5,000 prize money.

The one show he wishes he could have been on was Who Wants To Be A Millionaire - where he thinks he could have pocketed the cash.

'I tried a few times to get on that show but never managed to get through. I would like to think I would have made it to a million - I would have certainly given it a good go.'

But with 34 appearances under his belt, he was over the moon to hear of his official record.

'I was gobsmacked at the news. I knew I had been in a lot but that really does set a precedent.

'My success is going against me now a bit, as every time I apply for a quiz show I usually sail through and now I am not being accepted.

'I think the organisers have come to know my name now.

'But I don’t mind because I have had a great time and I’m still as passionate about quiz shows now as I was when I first started.'

In fact, he still regularly attends a Thursday night quiz at his local working men’s club in Hendesford, West Midlands.

'I love quizzes and I like to keep practicing and using my brain. I am very proud of what I have achieved.'

David St John has collected a range of merchandise items, perks and cash prizes for his numerous appearances on game shows.

Included in the list of items gifted to him are, unsurprisingly, many dictionaries, thesauruses and encyclopedias, as well as two motorbikes, pens, t-shirts and even a gold Kangaroo broach.

The one major perk he has received was a two-week, expenses paid holiday in Melbourne to appear on the Australian version of Sale of the Century.

And his total prize money? His nine wins have only earned him a total of about £5000, with a lot more cash having slipped through his grasp.

But his ultimate dream is to become the quiz master of his own show.

Mr St John said: 'I have been lucky enough to meet some great TV personalities along the way.

'But my dream would be to host my own quiz show. I would love the opportunity to go full circle and be the host.

'In my job as a comedy entertainer I have hosted quiz shows on cruises and up and down the UK, but I would love the experience of hosting my own show and I think after all this time I certainly have the right credentials for it.'

His wife of 40 years, Maria, 59, has supported him the whole way and he would always make his quiz show appearances a family day out, taking along his two daughters Mikaela, 43 and Tina, 27.

'My family have been very supportive of me, and it’s such a fun thing to be involved in.

'My advice to other quiz show contestants just starting out is to go for it. It’s really fun - you do run the risk of humiliation and it’s a lot of high pressure but it’s worth it.

He simply has a great memory and does not spend hours in front of the TV trying to learn new bits of trivia

'It’s really frustrating when you get the answer wrong, but some shows have really moody music atmospheric music and dim lighting and it can put you off so I try not to feel too bad about it. I can’t always get the answers all right.'

He insists unlike other quiz show contestants, he doesn’t spend hours in front of the TV every day learning new information, he just has a natural ability to retain facts.

'Throughout the years I’ve found most quiz show people sit there all day every day studying for quizzes, but I have a bit of gift for it. Being in a band when I was younger I have a good brain for remember lyrics and bits of information and jokes which has really helped me.

“I have been motivated by friends who have teased me about my trivia knowledge and asked: "what’s the point?"

'But for me it has been great to use my extensive trivia knowledge for TV quizzes.'

He is now due to take part in an ITV documentary, airing this week, called Come on Down - The Game Show Story.
