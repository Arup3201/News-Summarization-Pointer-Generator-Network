They were worthy World champions, sweeping aside the likes of Portugal, France, Brazil and Argentina to lift the greatest prize in football.

And after their triumph, everyone else was desperate to know the secrets of Joachim Low's Germany team - why exactly were they so successful?

Well, a new film about Die Mannschaft's journey to World Cup glory in Brazil could answer that question.

Combining behind-the-scenes footage from the German camp with highlights from those epic matches, 'Die Mannschaft' promises to lift the lid on how it was done.

The trailer for the film, which premieres in Berlin on November 10, shows the togetherness and camaraderie that carried Germany to victory - and a few rather bizarre moments.

For example, Bayern Munich striker Thomas Muller, who scored five goals at the World Cup, is seen wearing a bright pink Dirndl - the traditional Bavarian female dress - at the team's breakfast.

In other scenes in the sneak-peek, the players are seen lounging around the pool in the Brazilian sunshine, playing golf on the beach and singing and dancing on the team bus after their final win at the Maracana.

The film features behind-the-scenes footage that has not been shown before, including from the celebrations

The German stars are seen practising the free-kick routine used against Algeria in which Muller falls over as a distraction tactic.

What comes across even in the trailer is the unity within the team, whether it be on the pitch, in the changing room, on the team coach or back home.

Indeed, it starts with a quote from England captain Steven Gerrard: 'Brazil had Neymar, Argentina had Messi, Portugal had Ronaldo. Germany had a team.'

The film, produced by Constantin Film, is being released in German cinemas on November 13.
