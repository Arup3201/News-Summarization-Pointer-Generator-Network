Ben swift is the highest paid attorney in Ohio. Could it be because he billed workdays that included 29 hours, 23 hours, 21.5 hours, and 21 hours? 

Ben Swift who went before the Ohio disciplinary committee on Monday Sept.16, averaged out to nine hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Court appointed attorneys like Swift are paid by the state and the county.  

According to Swift's attorney Gary Lepia, Swift did all of the work he claimed to do but kept a sloppy record of his hours.

Ben Swift went before the Ohio Supreme Court on Monday Sept.16 for billing 29 hour work days

'We routinely put in 10-11-hour (work) days,' said Swift.

In an article published by the Dayton Daily News on March 6 2010, Montgomery County Juvenile Court judge Nick Kuntz said,'He’s probably billing more than humanly possible. That’s what it sounds like.' Kuntz's court was responsible for 60 per cent of Swift’s indigent case load.

When public defenders can't take on a case, courts hire a private attorney. Swift handled 848 indigent cases and was one of 5 out of 170 attorneys on the Juvenile appointment list who were given cases at all.

According to Ohio Public Defender Tim Young, giving a load of cases to a single attorney is problematic especially when they receive a large percentage of income from a single court.

Kettering attorney William T. Daly said he believes that poor people who can't afford to hire a lawyer are being short-changed by favoritism in the legal appointment system.

Daly said, 'Those attorneys that are more zealous, or perceived to be tenacious, are avoided because appointment of those attorneys creates more work for the magistrates, case coordinators and staff.'

Between March 2008 and February 2009 the state and counties paid out $1.8 million to appointed counsel like Swift across Ohio for 43,495 hours of time.

Swift said, 'Like any other thing in life, if somebody is doing a good job, you’re liable to go back to them.'

The Ohio Supreme Court will decide what sanctions to impose upon Swift.
