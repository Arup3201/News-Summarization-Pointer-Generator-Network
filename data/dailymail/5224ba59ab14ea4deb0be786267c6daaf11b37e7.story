Menace: John Worboys attacked numerous women between 2002 and 2008 as Scotland Yard's bungled investigation failed to track him down

More than 100 victims of 'black cab rapist' John Worboys could sue Scotland Yard over its botched investigation into the menace after two women won a landmark case.

The anonymous victims, attacked in 2003 and 2007, successfully claimed their human rights had been breached by the Metropolitan Police for failing to catch Worboys during his six year rampage across London.

Worboys, a former porn actor and stripper, attacked numerous women during a five-year period between 2002 and 2008.

The 53-year-old offered the women cheap lifts home after nights out but spiked their drinks before carrying out the assaults.

Police also found a 'rape kit' in the back of his taxi which including sleeping tablets, condoms and gloves.

Worboys, who called himself Terry the Minder, was jailed indefinitely in April 2009 with a minimum tariff of eight years.

But today, the two women - referred to as DSD and NBV - were awarded a High Court order for 
compensation from the Metropolitan Police under Article 3 of the Human Rights Act, 
which relates to inhuman treatment.

Mr 
Justice Green at London’s High Court ruled that the Met was liable to hundreds of women for failures in its investigation and poor treatment of victims.

DSD told the court she suffered from depression as a result of her 
treatment by officers during the 2003 investigation.

NBV claimed 
that she suffered serious distress, anxiety, guilt and an exacerbation 
of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression after her experience of the investigation in 2007.

Speaking on behalf of other victims, they accused the Met of allowing Worboys to run free and reoffend for an unacceptable amount of time.

Mr Justice Green said: 'In this case I have identified a series of 
systemic failings which went to the heart of the failure of the police 
to apprehend Worboys and cut short his five- to six-year spree of 
violent attacks.'

He berated senior officers for failing to train 
relevant officers in the intricacies of drug-facilitated sexual assaults and failing to supervise junior detectives.

He also attacked detectives for not making use of intelligence sources to find links between the cases.

Other 
failures included losing the confidence of victims and not creating an environment where victims felt comfortable to express their ordeals.

Landmark ruling: The High Court ruled in favour of the women who will now receive compensation and pave the way for more than 100 more victims to make claims

The judge said Worboys was clinical and conniving and the effect upon the women was profound.

'In
 the cases of DSD and NBV, I received evidence about the trauma they 
experienced at the time and subsequently, and have read the psychiatric 
reports upon them,' he said.

'I have learned that the effects of the 
assaults have stayed with them in a variety of ways over the ensuing 
years, manifesting themselves in depression, feelings of guilt, anxiety,
 and an inability to sustain relationships, including sexual 
relationships.

'That trauma has to be multiplied one hundred fold, 
and more, to begin to have a sense of the pain and suffering that 
Worboys’ serial predatory behaviour exerted upon his many victims.

'But
 their feelings are not the end of this circle of misery because, as was
 evident from the psychiatric and other evidence, the effects rippled 
throughout the victims’ families and their respective circles of 
friends.'

He said the Met was liable to both women for breach of the 
Human Rights Act in relation to the period between 2003 - which 
coincided with the first complaint to police - and 2009, when Worboys 
was tried.

In a statement, the Metropolitan 
Police Service said: 'The MPS has previously apologised for mistakes 
made in the investigation of rapes committed by Worboys.

'The
 judge acknowledged that the failings in this case were very much 
historic; a recognition that in the interim we have made important and 
significant changes to the way we investigate rape, which remains one of
 the most challenging and complex policing issues. We are committed to 
providing the best possible service to victims, ensuring that they are 
at the heart of every investigation.

'We will now take time to consider the judgment in full.'

DSD
 said later: 'After 11 years of living with guilt, I can now finally 
start to put it all behind me and move on with my life. I have always 
felt responsible for what happened to Worboys’ other victims but I now 
know this was not my fault.

'What I am now responsible for, and am extremely proud of, is making the Met finally accept they have a duty towards victims.'

NBV
 added: 'The experience of being disbelieved by the police was almost 
worse than the rape itself. It’s been unbearably hard to bring this case
 and spend years going over the same events.

'I am so relieved that our efforts have finally resulted in justice.'
