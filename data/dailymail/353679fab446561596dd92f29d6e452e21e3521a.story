A Florida teenager who spent years living in homeless shelters after his mom died is due to graduate next week as his high school valedictorian.

Despite all the upheaval in his life Griffin Furlong remained determined to succeed, and says he stayed strong thanks to his motto of 'never give up' which is written on the rim of his baseball caps.

The 18-year-old has managed to achieve a 4.65 grade average at school and is set to study engineering at Florida State University.

Determined: Griffin Furlong, pictured second left with his brother Sean, has been named class valedictorian after scoring an impressive 4.65 average despite being homeless

Motivated: Griffin writes his motto, 'Never give up', inside the rim of his baseball caps each season to remind him of what he is trying to achieve

Before he was selected as valedictorian at First Coast High School, few of Griffin's teachers and classmates knew about his hard life.

From the age of seven, he and his brother, Sean have been moved to various homeless shelters with their father, and often went hungry.

'I had to grow up really fast. I've seen things that kids wouldn't ever see in their lives,' he told Today, as he explained how the family became homeless after his mother's death when Griffin was six.

Living in shelters was difficult for Griffin, who recalled seeing his father being physically abused, and said he often went to bed hungry.

'I don't take anything for granted anymore,' the teenager, who enjoys playing baseball, said.

His most recent upheaval came just before his final exams, when Griffin found himself back in a shelter.

Loss: When he was just six years old, Griffin's mother died from leukemia

Focused: From a young age Griffin realized the only way he could change his life was to work hard at school

Fortunately, the family of his girlfriend were able to take him in for a few weeks until relatives could find space for him, and the teenager still managed to score highly in his tests.

'I know that I have everything to lose, so I just push myself,' he said, adding that school and family are all that he has.

His unconventional upbringing sometimes left Griffin feeling cut off from his peers. Because he was living in homeless shelters he couldn't have friends over, and had to take a different bus to school.

'A lot of kids made fun of me, but I didn't let
 that interfere with what I did in school. I had a plan - just make good
 grades, and don't worry about anyone else but my family,' he said.

The youngster quickly realized that the only chance he had to improve his life was to study hard, and despite his difficult home life, Griffin has never missed a day of school.

'I knew I was going to be poor for the 
rest of my life, so I thought if I could continue to do well in school, 
eventually scholarships would be coming my way and I would be getting a 
free education,' he said.

He added that he and his brother, who is due to graduate from Florida State University this summer, were also motivated to succeed in honor of their mother.

Ambitious: Griffin has never missed a day of school and is getting ready to start university

The brothers formed a close bond, often having only each other to confide in.

'I couldn't tell my friends what I was going through,' Sean, 21, said. 'It was mainly just me
 and Griffin, and we did everything together, baseball especially..

'He's just a really tough individual. He's younger than me, but I still 
look up to him,' he added.

After achieving a high grade average, Griffin has received scholarships to help pay for his university housing, and is now trying to get an academic scholarship to help with tuition.

A Go Fund Me page set up to help pay for his college education has raised more than $27,000 in just six days.

When he applied to university, one of his teachers wrote a letter of recommendation, praising not only his academic abilities but also his determination to succeed.Â 

'I said he was the hardest working, most-motivated student I have ever had,' teacher Jennifer Stover, told WPTV.

'He
 never missed a day of school, was always at baseball practice and 
managed to get his homework done every night and always do well,' 
another said,

Griffin said that as details of his upbringing became more widely known it helped ease the burden he has been carrying.

He is due to give a speech at his high school graduation on June 4, and will share his message of determination.

'Just never give up. Never let anyone tell you that you can't do something, because I've been told that all my life ... now I'm here at the top of my class.'
