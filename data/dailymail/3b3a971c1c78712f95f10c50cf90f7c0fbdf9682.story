Broken Britain: Prime Minister David Cameron said during a visit to a Norwich school yesterday that he was determined to bring 'rigour' back to the classroom

David Cameron yesterday launched a 
blitz on ‘coasting’ schools in affluent areas which are being outshone 
by their inner-city counterparts.

He said hundreds of secondary schools in better-off parts of the country needed a ‘wake-up call’ to improve their results.

In a major speech, Mr Cameron said 
that schools in areas such as Oxfordshire and Surrey were being 
out-performed by two inner-city London schools.

The Prime Minister said these coasting
 schools could not blame deprivation for their poor results and pledged 
to expose their ‘complacency’.

Speaking at a newly-opened free school
 in Norwich, Mr Cameron also warned that parents of youngsters who play 
truant face having their benefits cuts.

He pledged to bring ‘rigour’ back into
 Britain’s classrooms and condemned Labour’s ‘prizes for all’ culture, 
which frowns on competitiveness.

Mr Cameron is under increasing 
pressure to reassure Tory MPs and voters that the Coalition is in touch 
with middle-class anxieties.

His speech was seen as a deliberate 
contrast to pledges by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to drive up 
standards in poorer areas.

Promising a ‘revolution’ in choice, 
competition and freedom for schools, Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s not just 
failing schools we need to tackle.

Respect: As well as giving teachers' more powers to deal with unruly pupils, 'restoring discipline is also about what parents do', Mr Cameron said

It’s coasting schools, too – the ones 
whose results have  either flat-lined or where they haven’t improved as 
much as they could have.’

He said four-fifths of schools in 
Oxfordshire and Surrey had produced poorer results than Walworth Academy
 and Burlington Danes Academy, both of which are in London.

Between 70 to 75 per cent of pupils at
 the London schools gained five or more good GCSEs, despite large 
numbers being eligible for free school meals – the accepted measure of 
relative poverty. Mr Cameron went on: ‘That must be a wake-up call. Why 
is there this difference? Why are these schools coasting along?’

Twenty-four new free schools have been set up in England since the Coalition came to power - more than half open this week, the rest by the end of the month.The policy, a central plank of the Conservatives' election manifesto, gives people the chance to set up schools in direct response to local demand.Free schools can be primary or secondaries and can be set up by a wide range of proposers which have included teachers, parents, charities, universities, businesses and faith groups. Many are being set up because there are simply not enough school places in the area.The schools, like the new academies, are funded directly by Westminster, are semi-independent and outside local authority control. They have the freedom to vary term times, the curriculum and teachers' pay and conditions.Free schools cannot make a profit and will be subject to the same Ofsted inspections as state schools. They will also have to take part in their local admissions process.

Senior Downing Street sources said 
‘super heads’ with experience of turning schools around could  be 
drafted in to work alongside existing head teachers to improve 
standards.

One source said that parents will be 
able to judge whether their school is ‘coasting’ when more detailed 
performance figures are published in January next year. 

The Government recently announced it 
was increasing the minimum standard for schools. By 2015 any secondary 
school in which fewer than 50 per cent of pupils get five good GCSEs 
will be defined as failing. The standard is currently 30 per cent.

Ministers hope a further 200 free 
schools will open next year, and also say around 150 failing secondaries
 and 200 failing primary schools will have been transformed into 
academies by that time.

Mr Cameron said more discipline was needed to mend a ‘broken society’.

Chris Keates, of NASUWT, the largest 
teachers’ union, said: ‘The Prime Minister’s speech is a desperate 
attempt to detract attention from the fact that his Coalition Government
 is engaged in a deliberate attempt to privatise schools.’

n Mr Cameron wants his old school, Eton College, to set up a free school, it emerged yesterday.

He has held meetings in Downing Street
 with the heads of top public schools – including the exclusive 
£30,000-a-year boarding school.

It is considering setting up a free 
‘mini Eton’, with boarding facilities and high academic standards – but 
without the price tag.

David Cameron is perfectly placed to discuss elitism in British society having benefited from attendance at the cream of the independent English education system.

As a young boy he attended the 
preparatory school, Heatherdown, in Berkshire, favoured by Royals and 
boasting Princes Andrew and Edward as former pupils.

It
 was from their exclusive classrooms that he made the move to the 
world’s best known public school for boys, Eton, where annual fees at 
the six hundred-year-old boys’ school are £31,000.

At
 current rates the Prime Minister’s senior school years would have cost 
more than £150k and that does not include expenditure on school clubs, 
like boating and fencing which carry additional tariffs.

The
 Prime Minister-in-waiting then moved to study Philosophy, Politics and 
Economics at Oxford becoming a member of the select all-boy dining 
society, The Bullingdon Club.

His elevated position in society is apparent in every aspect of his life and has seen him marry well.

His
 wife Samantha is the daughter of Sir Reginald Adrian Berkeley Sheffield
 and her mother is Annabel Lucy Veronica Astor, Viscountess Astor and 
CEO of furniture chain OKA.
