The taxpayer is paying for a limousine to drive Michael Gove just 440 yards between Downing Street and Parliament.

The Chief Whip is regularly ferried the short distance using a £100,000 government car service so he can attend meetings in Number 10.

Mr Gove, who was sacked as Education Secretary last year, defended the use of the car insisting it would be carrying classified government papers even if he is not sat on the back seat 

Chief Whip Michael Gove is regularly ferried the short distance using a £100,000 government car service so he can attend meetings in Number 10

Mr Gove was captured by the Daily Mirror taking just 73 seconds to travel 440 yards in his silver Jaguar from Parliament to Downing Street.

Many Cabinet ministers arrive in Downing Street on foot, after the coalition cut the budget for ministerial cars.

But Mr Gove is frequently seen stepping out of his car, often clutching newspapers and coffee cups.

Labour MP Grahame Morris told the Mirror: 'The Tories preach austerity while wasting taxpayers' cash. Seeing Michael Gove use his chauffeur-driven car, even if he's only going down the road, shows they revel in the trappings of office while others struggle to make ends meet.'  

But a spokesman for Mr Gove said that he was simply following 'standard Cabinet Office protocol' for ministers when they are carrying sensitive official papers.

'This is a total non-story. As Chief Whip, Michael Gove carries sensitive papers and the rules are these have to be transported securely,' the spokesman said.

'Government cars often make short journeys like this to transport papers even if there is no minister in them. The Chief Whip has followed the standard Cabinet Office protocol and will continue to do so.'

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'On each of these occasions, the car contained highly-classified papers which had to be transported from Downing Street to the House of Commons.

'The ministerial code is clear that official cars can be used to transport classified documents which must be handled securely.

'Therefore, these journeys had to be made regardless of whether the Chief Whip was in the car himself.'

The government boasted it had cut the cost of cars for ministers by 44 per cent in the first year of the coalition.

The number of ministers who have access to an official car was cut from 78 to 13, with some Cabinet ministers forced to share cars or take the bus.
