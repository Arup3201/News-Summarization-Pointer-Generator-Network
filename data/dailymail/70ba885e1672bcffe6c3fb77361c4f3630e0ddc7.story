The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge bid farewell to New Zealand this morning as they boarded a flight bound for Australia.

The couple waved and smiled at the crowds gathered to see them off at Wellington Airport, with William holding an alert and lively Prince George in his arms.

After 10 days in New Zealand, the family will arrive at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport in the afternoon to embark on a second, ten day tour of Australia.

Say goodbye, George! The Cambridges waved goodbye at New Zealand's Wellington Airport today as they boarded a flight bound for Sydney

Proud: Prince William held his son, Prince George in his arms, the little boy looking around curiously from the safety of his father's arms

Wide awake: Prince George was alert and curious as he was held by his father as they made as the family prepared to leave New Zealand

The couple were still dressed in the outfits they wore for their morning of engagements in Wellington: the Duke a blue suit, which complemented his wife's navy Rebecca Taylor outfit.

George was also coordinated with his parents in dark shirts, socks and shoes, a white woolen jumper keeping out the cold.

William held his bouncing baby boy outwards so that that he could take in the scene.

Meeting the price: Airport personnel greeted the Cambridges and shook the hand of the eight-month-old

Curious: Baby George took in his surroundings as he was carried to the plane in the arms of William

George, eight months, appeared lively and interested as he boarded the plane to the cheers of well-wishers.

His appearance is the fourth time he has been seen in public - once when he left hospital, on arrival in Wellington last week and again on his first public engagement at a Plunket parents and babies group in Government House.

He is also due to be seen when the family arrive in Sydney shortly after 2.30pm today and again when the family visit Taronga Zoo.

Are you alright down there? The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got some canine cuddles from two 12-day-old German Shepard puppies as they visited the Royal New Zealand Police College in the small city of Porirua, just outside of Wellington

Earlier in the day the couple visited the Royal New Zealand Police College.

Kate, wearing a navy blue suit by New Zealand designer Rebecca Taylor, grinned from ear to ear when introduced to a couple of 12-day old puppies from the Dog Training Centre.

She immediately picked up her puppy for a cuddle and stroked it. She said: 'It wants to hide under my jacket. I think it can smell George.'

She then asked Police Commissioner Mike Bush, 'What do you feed them?' and 'Can they see yet?'

It was a typically wet Wellington day as the couple visited the college, where they were greeted by claps and cheers from the crowd, before being given a tour and meeting some furry police recruits

A present for George: When the Duchess was given a soft plush toy intended for George from a young girl, Kate replied 'He'll love it'

The German shepherd puppies were born on April 4 and were the first litter of DTC bitch Gucci and stud dog Borg, via artificial insemination.

After holding the puppies, the Royal couple met three lots of foster families and the police dogs they're helping to train up, who were all lapping water up off the parade ground.

The first was three-year-old Yana. Kate asked foster mum Sharon Nicholas the dog's age and said, 'She's sweet.' The duchess asked, 'How has she coped?' and, 'How did you get involved?'

She asked Melony Weallens about her foster dog Winta, 'Who's this then?' and, 'What age did you get her? Is she your only dog? She's so sweet. Do they need a lot of exercise?'.

Melony said of her daughter Cadence, 16, 'She's taken Winta for more walks since she heard she was going to meet the royals.'

The final foster family was John and Sarah Bole with daughters Morgan, 14, Madison, 10, and Monet, 8, with dog Gessy, four months.

Kate asked, 'How old is Gessy? Was she tiny when you got her?' The girls gave Kate a stuffed-toy police dog for George. Kate said, 'Aww, that's so sweet. He'll love it. Does it have a name? Maybe we should call it Gessy. Sorry we couldn't bring George. He was asleep. He's a very podgy baby.'

William added: 'This will come with us to Australia.'

The college's Kapa Haka (Maori cultural) group also gave an impromptu performance of Singing in the Rain - a tribute to the appalling weather - which had the royals couple in stitches. They then segued into a traditional Maori tune with a poi dancer performing.

Shortly before morning tea, Wills and Kate were presented with police one-piece for George that read 'junior recruit'. Wills said "Fantastic. Brilliant. He'll love that. Thank you. Will it fit him? He's grown!' Kate agreed, adding: 'He's grown lots!'

All smiles: Despite the unfortunate weather the Cambridges smiled broadly as they were greeted by crowds at the police college outside Wellington

Sight for sore eyes: Despite the rain the waiting crowds clapped, cheered and took photos as the couple arrived

They later met a little girl with an inoperable brain tumour, Iris Pouau, from Porirua, who had turned seven yesterday.

She wore hundreds of beads representing the number of times shed had surgical procedures and presented Kate with a bouquet of purple irises. She also held a toy dog that police had given her yesterday for her birthday.

Kate: 'It's very nice to meet you. How old are you?' Looking at the toy dog, she added 'He's very cute. Have you seen the puppies outside? You've been a very, very good girl.'

The Duchess also talked to Iris' mum Darlene Tuiono, 43. Asked when the kids 'break up for their Easter holiday'. Darlene mentioned it was Iris' birthday yesterday.

Kate replied:Â  'Oh, she didn't tell me that! Iris, did you have a good day? Happy birthday! '

William added: 'You're very pretty today. It was lovely to meet you.'

Wet dog: William gave a police dog who'd got caught in the downpour a gentle scratch

Afterwards William and Kate conducted a walkabout in Wellington, enjoying the largest turn-out of their trip so far.

A huge crowd bid a very vocal fond farewell to the Duke and Duchess at Civic Square.

The couple shook hands and spoke with hundreds of people, especially small children, senior citizens and the disabled, before and after signing the city's visitors' book.

William accepted a rather squashed block of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate, saying: 'We'll like that!'

Rachel Scott, 46, from Derbyshire, now Wellington, showed the prince a picture of him doing work experience at Chatsworth House in the UK eight years ago with her father, John Reilly.

She said: 'He used to see William every day for two weeks and the prince would ask him every morning, 'Where should I park?' My dad would say, 'Because it's you, you can park anywhere but the disabled spot. You don't look very disabled.'

'William would park his car and then pretend to hobble across the car park.

'William was just seeing Kate at the time and my dad would ask, 'So William, have you got any crumpet at the moment?' He'd reply, 'I couldn't possibly comment.'
