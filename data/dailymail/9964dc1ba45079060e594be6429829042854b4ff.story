It was intended to be a show of support as the torch relay passed through the area.

But an estate agent who created a celebratory Olympics display using hula hoops as the famous five rings has been ordered to take it down by Games organisers – and threatened with legal action if he doesn’t.

Staff at Webbers Estate Agents in Braunton, Devon, created a display featuring the rings, flags, a replica torch and a cut-out of cyclist Chris Hoy to ‘join in the spirit’ as the relay passed through the village.

Soon after, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games wrote insisting Webbers take down Olympic-related materials – or face legal action.

It said displaying the rings without permission breached sponsorship deals.

Manager Colin Thorne said: ‘To receive a letter threatening legal action is pathetic.’

It comes after a florist was warned her Olympic ring display could get her sued, while last week an 81-year-old had to withdraw a doll from a church sale because its knitted outfit bore the symbol.
