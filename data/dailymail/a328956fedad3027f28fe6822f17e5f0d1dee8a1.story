Facial hair is often criticised for being scruffy and ungainly, but for these men, it is a way of life.

The group, some of whom have spent years perfecting their beards and moustaches, gathered in Leinfelden-Echterdingen, near Stuttgart, Germany, to celebrate their unconventional looks during the Beard World Cup.

Sporting Dalis, Goatees and Hungarians, their aim was to take home the coveted prize of the world's best facial hair.

Rotator blades: Aarne Bielefeldt, who has been growing his facial hair his whole life, takes six hours to prepare his extraordinary look

Patterned: Hans Peter Weis has been growing his facial hair for 15 years and takes three hours to prepare this overlapping pattern, which boasts a mixture of colours

Whiskers: Keith Gandhi Jones Haubrich takes 30 minutes to shape his moustache to look like a cat

Entrants included one man with a very
 convincing looking cat on his upper-lip while another styled his beard 
in the shape of helicopter blades.

Other wacky whiskers involved a man who had grown his beards all the way to his waistline and another that looked like tusks.

Photographer
 Christophe Gateau, 23, set-up studio at the event and recorded each 
person’s name, how long they’ve been growing the beard and how long it 
takes for them to groom it each day.

The
 event took place last November but Mr Gateau has only just released the
 fascinating images and this is the first time they have been seen 
publically.

He said: 'It was a crazy event, lots of men showing off their beards on a stage, lots of them were drunk.

Cowboy: Paul Roof spends two hours preparing his incredible starfish-shaped facial hair

Tusks: Contestant Michael Johnson somehow manages to keep his upward beard in place and almost perfectly groomed

Slick: This man, known only as Suesskind, has been growing his facial hair for eight years and takes 40 minutes to prepare these curves

'Without wanting to sound mean – it was a freak show.'

Mr Gateau used an analogue Medium Format camera on black and white film. The large cameras, that measure 6in by 8in, allow for amazing detail.

'I developed all the pictures from negatives in my darkroom, it took one month to develop, scan, clean off the dust, post-production, layout and then print it.

'People are mostly amused when they see the photos. No-one mentions the word sexy or beautiful, some were disgusted.'

Well-groomed: Nobert Topf has spent 11 years perfecting his grey, spiralled moustache and goatee

Length: Kjm Lovenskjold has taken 40 years to get his beard all the way down to his waistline

Slick: It only takes nine minutes for Felix Hommage to get the thin strands of hair to stay put

Rugged: Charles Saville spends 45 minutes creating his bow-shaped beard. It has taken 25 years for the hair to reach its optimum length

Tough: Eric Jansson has taken three years to develop his thick beard. It takes him an hour to get it into shape

Contestants were judged in the following categories - Moustache Imperial, Moustache Natural, Moustache English, Moustache Dali, Moustache Hungarian, Moustache Freestyle, Goatee Natural, Goatee Beard Fu Manchu, Goatee Musketeer, Goatee Imperial, Goatee Freestyle, Chin-Beard Freestyle, Full Beard Natural, Full Beard Garibaldi, Full Beard Verdi, Full Beard Freestyle, and Trendbeards.

Despite the numerous judgement categories, there was one clear winner for Christophe.

'Cat-moustache - he was the last one I did. I was taking down the equipment when I saw him and said: "Ok one more!"'

Stiff upper lip: Jaromi Zsolt has been growing his moustache for 28 years. It only takes him four minutes to prepare the sharp look

Business attire: Entrant Nick Pectu has spent a year growing both his curly moustache and bushy beard

Smart attire: This man, known only as Fulio, combines his moustache and pin-striped suit to create a dapper appearance

Medieval: Drew Muncaster, wearing armour on his shoulders and arms, takes thrree minutes to prepare his spikey moustache and goatee

Straight as an arrow: Sam Holcombe spends an hour twisting his moustache for the perfect look

Curly: Michael Wallage has spent 20 years growing his beard and spends 40 minutes grooming his beard and moustache

Symmetry: Marijan Vidakovic, who has been growing his facial hair for 23 years, manages to make each side virtually identical
