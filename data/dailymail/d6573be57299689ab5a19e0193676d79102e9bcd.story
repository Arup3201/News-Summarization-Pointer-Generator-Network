The father of a Philadelphia nurse who was grabbed off the street said she befriended her abductor in order to survive.

Carlesha Freeland-Gaither was found inside a parked car 120 miles away in Jessup, Maryland, three days after she was kidnapped.

The 22-year-old's alleged abductor, Delvin Barnes, was arrested at the scene and indicted on a federal kidnapping charge yesterday.

Carl Freeland told ABC News: 'I'm glad that my daughter was a friendly person and got him into being a friendly guy so he wouldn't harm her.'

'I give all the praise to my daughter. She's the hero.' 

He spoke after the City Council honored those who helped to find his daughter.

Carlesha's grandfather Derek Alston added she had 'more or less convinced him to be her friend.' 

A massive manhunt was launched when Barnes allegedly grabbed Carlesha near a Philadelphia bus stop on November 2 and forced the struggling woman into his car. 

Federal agents found her three days later in his car in Jessup.

Federal prosecutors initially charged Barnes, of Charles County, Virginia, the day after his capture.

By law, most federal cases can't be prosecuted without a grand jury indictment. If convicted, Barnes faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

At City Hall yesterday, the Philadelphia City Council honored those who helped find the nursing assistant, who is still recovering from the ordeal and has not yet returned to work. 

Mr Alston, said: 'She's coming along. She's working, trying to readjust.'

Barnes is also charged with attempted murder in the abduction of a 16-year-old girl in Virginia in early October. 

He allegedly hit the teen in the head with a shovel, put her in a trunk and took her to a mobile home, where he doused her in bleach and gasoline before she escaped. 

She broke free as Barnes was digging her grave, authorities said. 

Authorities were able to track the nurse down with the help of tips from the public, including the discovery of an empty bag of potato chips and a receipt

NOV. 2, 9.40 pm: Carlesha Freeland-Gaither is grabbed while walking along a Philadelphia street. She struggles to break free before being forced into what appears to be a gray Ford Taurus and apparently kicking out a rear window. 

NOV 3, 6.01 am: Her bank card is used at a machine in Aberdeen, Maryland. 

The first transaction is unsuccessful, the second one goes through for $20. Surveillance video captures dark, grainy pictures of a man. 

Minutes later, surveillance video shows a man fitting the same description making a purchase in a gas station mini-mart. 

A receipt shows he bought Herr's Sour Cream and Onion potato chips, a bottle of water and two other items, paying with a $20 bill.

NOV 3, 8 am: A woman in Havre de Grace, Maryland, finds items in her driveway, including a cut zip-tie, a stretched out key chain ring, candy wrappers, a Herr's Sour Cream and Onion potato chips wrapper and a receipt from an ACME supermarket in Philadelphia - with a transaction time and date of 1.40 pm on November 2.

NOV 4, 7 pm: The woman who found the items in her driveway reports the discovery to police. 

Video footage from the Philadelphia supermarket shows a man matching the description of the person at the bank machine and mini-mart.

NO DATE: Investigators from the Charles City County Sheriff's Office in Virginia examine surveillance photos and conclude man likely is Delvin Barnes. 

The office had obtained a warrant October 28 for his arrest on kidnapping, rape and other charges. 

They determine a gray Ford Taurus is registered to him.

NOV 5: The Ford Taurus registered to Barnes is located in Jessup, Maryland. 

Barnes is found lying in the backseat, next to the victim. The rear passenger window is missing and covered by pieces of plastic. 

The FBI says Barnes admits to abducting the woman, and told them he didn't know his victim. 

NOV 6: Carlesha's mother, Keisha Gaither, thanked the Philadelphia police, the FBI, the public, and her family and friends for helping find her daughter.

'Thank you so much for having us in your prayers. Thank you for keeping me up. Thanking for being there for us. I'm taking my baby home. Thank you. Thank you so much,' she said. 

NOV 7: Barnes is charged with federal kidnapping. Police reveal he has a history of violence.

Authorities say he choked his ex-wife a decade ago and abducted a 16-year-old Virginia girl just last month with the intention of killing her.

NOV 12: Barnes, of Charles City County, Virginia, who has been in custody since his capture, is indicted on a federal kidnapping charge and appointed a public defender.
