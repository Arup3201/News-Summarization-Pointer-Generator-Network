An alligator came dangerously close to shoppers at a Florida Walmart shortly after midnight Sunday.

Employees at the Apopka store had to lock one entrance of the store as the predator set off the automatic sliding doors and managers were afraid the gator would enter the store.Police officers arrived on the scene to ensure no customers came to close to the beast.

Shopping trip: The alligator hung around the Walmart in Apopka for about an hour

The Walmart at Orange Blossom Trail and Hiawassee Road is open 24 hours and plenty of customers were around to witness the beast's arrival.It's unclear whether it was drawn by the low, low prices, but the gator's presence certainly didn't stop Walmart customers.

'Someone inside said there was a gator at the door. So of course, curious people, we came out and it was right against the door, it was probably five or six foot long, just chilling,' one shopper told WESH.

Police called state Fish and wildlife officers when the alligator showed no sign of leaving the store.

Later, gator: The predator finally wandered off to a lake behind the store where it's believed he or she lives

Shortly before they arrived, though, the alligator wandered off, having been circling the store for about an hour.

According to authorities, there's a lake and wooded area behind the discount retailer where the alligator lives.

Fish and Wildlife officers are expected to conduct a search for the animal during the daylight hours to determine whether it's a risk to humans and needs to be relocated.

In 2011, SNAP, the Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program, received 14,275 nuisance alligator complaints resulting in the removal of 6,995 nuisance alligators.
