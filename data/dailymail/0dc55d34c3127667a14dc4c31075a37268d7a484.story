Matt Frost, 29, from Cornwall, loved working as a cattle farmer during his 52-jobs a year challenge

A shop manager who decided he wanted to find a career he loved rather than tolerated is trying a different job every week - for a year.

Matt Frost, 29, made the life-changing decision after he was forced to take time off following an accident at work when a box of metal brackets fell on his head.

During months of recuperation at home in Cornwall, he realised that much as he liked his colleagues, there must be more to life.

Mr Frost told MailOnline: 'I'd worked in shops ever since leaving college at 17, and during the time I was recuperating, I just wondered if this was what I wanted to be doing for the rest of my life.

'I realised I didn't just want to enjoy evenings and weekends - I wanted to enjoy what I did for a living.

'As I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, I thought I would try different things.'

Quite a lot of different things: Mr Frost decided to try 52 various jobs, for five days each, for the whole of 2013.

He also thought this would be a good way to earn money for charity, and has vowed to give each week's pay to The Prince's Trust, which helps disadvantaged young people.  So far, he has raised more than £2,500.

Mr Frost, who lives at home in Liskeard, Cornwall, with his father photographer father Rob, 57, mother Pauline, 55, and sister Michelle, 27, both of whom work in supermarkets.

He said his family have been supportive of his challenge and hope it leads to him finding a job he will love.

The jobs have taken him across southern England, throughout his home county and as far as London - with temporary employment also offered later this year in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland.

The week Mr Frost spent working as a stuntman was difficult and painful, but he says he is loving the variety

It tooks months of recuperation after an accident to make Mr Frost realise he wanted to do something else

Despite having to dip into his bank overdraft and cut back on his usual Mothering Sunday extravagance, the 29-year-old said he is determined to see the challenge through to the end of the year.

'It's tough living on virtually no disposable income, so you can certainly say I'm giving my overdraft a run for its money,' he said.

'But I knew this was going to be tricky when I started, so it has not come as a shock.

'I'm trying to cut back personal costs as much as possible, so I am accepting lifts from people and crashing on sofas if I am working away from home.

Jack of all trades: Matt Frost will be well-placed to choose a career he loves by the end of the year

'There's a group of mates I haven't seen since this has started and I'm afraid Mum got something a little cheap for Mother's Day.

'I've written my fair share of IOUs too, but that's all part of the challenge for me and I am loving it.'

Placements have varied from hard labour to mentally exhausting office roles, and Mr Frost has also had to spend his free time setting up future placements, travel and living arrangements.

He said: 'I was a stunt man for a week, which involved a lot of me being used as a padded punch bag. It was great fun, but a bit of a relief when the bell went at the end of the day.

Positive attitude: Despite having to be the new boy every Monday for a year, Mr Frost is thriving on his challenge

Exhausting but satisfying: The week he spent working as a cattle farmer was one of Mr Frost's favourites

'This week I have been working with children with special needs in Plymouth, which has been incredible too, for different reasons.

'And my time at the Prince's Trust was completely eye-opening - I have been able to see where the money I have raised is going, and seeing the real-life accounts of people who are genuinely struggling to get by.'

He says the jobs he has most enjoyed so far have been the outdoor, physical ones - beef-farming and working as a blacksmith left him exhausted but happy at the end of each day. 

He also enjoyed jobs with creativity: 'When I worked as a blacksmith I loved thinking I'd made a metal gate which might last for years and years.'

There are still 41 weeks of the challenge left, and potential employers are asked to get in touch if they can help

Mr Frost, who is now in week 11 of his challenge, says even if he finds his dream job, he will finish his challenge before pursuing it.

'Everyone asks what I will do if I find my ideal job early on, but I've set myself the challenge and I'm going to stick to it,' he said.

'Parts of it are hard - showing up somewhere new every Monday, always being the new person, and having to get to know people - but I'm enjoying the discipline and the opportunities this is bringing me, and I feel so lucky to be doing it.'

Mr Frost added: 'Obviously, all my wages are going to charity, so if there are some high-paying employers out there, I'd love to hear from them.'
