A three-year-old girl has suffered brain damage after she was allegedly given too much anesthesia during a trip to the dentist.

Finley Boyle's mother Ashley took the little girl to theÂ Island Dentistry for Children in Oahu, Hawaii on December 3 for a root canal.

But tragedy unfolded when Finley reportedly went into cardiac arrest. A Facebook group set up to support her family claims she suffered the brain damage after she was given too many drugs.

'Finley went into cardiac arrest after being given the MAX DOSAGE of sedatives, lidocaine and the gas mask,' it explains.

'After doing an MRI it was determined 
that FINLEY SUFFERED SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE and her life and the life of 
those who love and care for that sweet little girl are changed forever.'

The procedure was being carried out by Dr Lilley Geyer, according to Hawaii News Now, who is certified in life support and cardiac life support, according to her website.

But the family's friends claim that when Finley began suffering complications, staff ran down the hall to a pediatricians office to get help with CPR.

A sign at the Dentistry for Children office says it is currently closed and a man inside told Hawaii News Now that they had no comment.

It is unknown if Finley, who moved 
with her mother from the mainland around three years ago, suffered any 
pre-existing medical conditions that could have complicated the 
procedure.

'Finley has opened and closed her eyes with no response a couple times and is able to breathe on her own,' friends posted on the Facebook group.

Photographs shared online show the bubbly little girl grinning and playing with relatives. Family members have flown from the mainland to be with her mother.

The Facebook group adds: 'No family should ever have to face such a
tragedy and although we cannot change the outcome we can pray for 
healing for all those experiencing this horrific event.'

Her family has hired an attorney, Hawaii News Now reported.

The
Island Dentistry for Children opened in 2006 and has approximately 
2,000 patients. The State has not received any complaints against Dr 
Geyer in the past.

Innocent: Finley has opened her eyes a few times but has not been responsive, family friends said

Hopes: She is now at Kapiolani Medical Center, pictured, where her family is praying for a miracle
