As many as one million tickets for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games will go on sale today.

Glasgow is preparing to welcome 4,500 
athletes from 71 nations and territories of the Commonwealth who will 
take part in the 11 day event next summer.

The Glasgow-born ambassador for the 
Games Michael Jamieson will signal the start of the process at 10am by 
diving into the refurbished pool at the Tollcross International Swimming
Centre.

Jamieson, who won an Olympic silver medal for the 200m breaststroke in London last year, trained at Tollcross when he was a boy and will return to compete for Commonwealth gold for Team Scotland next summer.

Young swimmers from Glasgow School of Sport will join the Olympian as he launches the start of ticket sales, with two-thirds of them costing less than £25.

The swimmer anticipates Glasgow 2014 will be a highlight of his career and has encouraged people to get a seat and watch it live.

'The difference between watching a big multi-sport event on television or actually being there and experiencing it is second to none,' said the swimmer.

'These are elite athletes in every one of the 17 sports competing against their rivals so no matter which sport you get tickets for you will be enthralled, excited and entertained. There is nothing to beat live sport.'

Lord Smith of Kelvin, Glasgow 2014 Chairman, said: 'Glasgow 2014 in every sense is a Games for everyone and a fantastic opportunity to experience world-class sport up close in one of the world's great sporting cities. We look forward to welcoming elite athletes from across the Commonwealth and the best welcome we can give them are stadia packed with supporters cheering them on.

'Now is your chance to be part of this friendly force of fans for what I hope will be a great moment for sport, for Glasgow and Scotland.'

Tickets are available from today for four weeks, until Monday, September 16.

The price of adult tickets start at £15 and two-thirds of them are less than £25.

Deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the event 'will guarantee top class sporting drama for spectators and a great Glasgow welcome for visitors'

For the first time at a Commonwealth Games half-price concessions will be available for under 16s.

Deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: 'This is a chance to be part of one of the world's biggest events and the largest ever multi-sport event in Scotland.

'With affordable ticket prices and concessions for children and over 60s, this is a truly family friendly Games that will guarantee top class sporting drama for spectators and a great Glasgow welcome for visitors.'

Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, said: 'We're working hard to promote the Games as a must see event next year with Glasgow the start of a fantastic adventure here in Scotland.

'Our message is clear enjoy a magnificent Commonwealth Games, enjoy one of the best cities in the world - now go and enjoy the rest of Scotland.'

A new Commonwealth Games section has been launched on VisitScotland.com, providing information about the city, the event and travel elsewhere in Scotland and last month a £2.5 million campaign was announced to target millions of potential visitors from across the Commonwealth.

At least 70 per cent of tickets will be made available to the public via the ticketing system which opens today.

Applications for tickets can be made online on glasgow2014.com/tickets from 10am or via postal applications found in the Official Ticketing Guide.

Organisers have said there will be an equal opportunity to apply for tickets during the four weeks saying it makes no difference when the application is made as long as it is received by 6pm on Monday, September 16.
