Two women were shot and killed and six other people were wounded in an early-morning attack at a house party in Nebraska's largest city, Omaha, police said.

Officers responded to a report of gunfire at a home at the intersection of North 34th and Parker streets shortly before 2am on Saturday.

The department said  two women were dead at the scene, including 19-year-old mother-of-one Ja'Kela Foster.

Three people were taken by ambulance to Nebraska-Medicine-University of Nebraska Medical Center, where one is in a critical condition.

Three others were driven to the hospital in someone's vehicle. Their conditions weren't released.

Kristina Young, mother of slain Ja'Kela Foster, was waiting outside of the home hours later while investigators continued to gather evidence.

She said she wasn't going to leave until the body of her daughter was taken away.

Young said her boyfriend got a call from an aunt shortly before 2am telling him there was a shooting that may have involved Foster, who leaves behind a one-year-old son.

She said a friend later called to say her daughter had been shot.

Young said her daughter knew the person throwing the party and that she asked her not to go, knowing there would be drinking and worried there could be violence.

Tragic: Foster (pictured with her son) was planning on going elsewhere on Friday but ended up at the party

'I've been in Omaha long enough to know generally what happens at these parties.'

She said her daughter agreed and told her she was going elsewhere Friday night, but that she apparently went to the party anyway.

'To the person who pulled the trigger, I want to say it's just senseless. It just needs to stop. I now have a one-year-old grandson that has no mother,' Young said while fighting back tears. 

She was comforted by her 29-year-old son, DeSean Young, who was Foster's brother.

Danger: Foster's mother said she warned her daughter not to go to the house party earlier that day 

Also wounded: Three people were taken by ambulance to Nebraska-Medicine-University of Nebraska Medical Center, where one is in a critical condition, and another three sustained severe wounds

Dorothy Wayne, who lives across the street from the home, said she and her husband were asleep when a shot passed through the wall of their front bedroom and lodged in the far wall. Neither was hurt.

Although much of Omaha's violent crime happens in the area, Wayne said she was surprised by the shootings because it's always been a quiet street.

'There are mostly old people on our block,' she said.
