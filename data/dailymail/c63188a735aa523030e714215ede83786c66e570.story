'The fight of his life': David Cameron announcing plans to open public services to competition yesterday

David Cameron was yesterday told he faced the 'fight of his life' after announcing plans to open up nearly every part of Britain's public services to competition from the  private sector.

Union leaders reacted with fury as the Prime Minister vowed to press ahead with the biggest reform of public services for more than 50 years.

The long-awaited White Paper contains plans for private and voluntary organisations to be able to bid to run every part of public service except national security, frontline policing and the judiciary.

Mr Cameron warned that the 'old narrow, closed, state monopoly' was dead and the State would be forced to justify why it cannot be opened up to outside competition.

The Prime Minister said his wide-ranging reforms would have an impact up and down the country and would be felt in 'every state school, hospital and prison, by every doctor, teacher, parent, patient and citizen'.

Mr Cameron vowed he would not 'pull back or lose heart' from the job of modernising public services in the face of angry opposition from the unions, Liberal Democrats and Labour.

Other proposals in the White Paper include the introduction of a legal right for the public to choose in every area of public services – from where they send their children to school to where they have an operation.

The consumer organisation Which? will also be given new powers to fight for consumers in the public sector as well as the private. And residents will be given unprecedented new powers to run council services – from libraries and museums to parks and swimming pools.

Under the plans, parish councils will be given sweeping new powers to run local neighbourhoods, including licensing pubs, banning strip clubs and bringing in parking schemes.

The White Paper proposes that 
residents form John Lewis-style 'mutuals' – where they can decide how to
run services. These groups will be given cash budgets to buy in 
services from health through to education. The moves are the latest 
expansion of Mr Cameron's 'Big Society' plan.

In a speech to the Reform  campaign group in London, Mr Cameron said: 'We want to see democracy on a properly hyper-local scale.

'You and the people you know – the people you wave to on your way to work in the morning – having genuine control over the things that matter to you: Improvements to your streets, your roads, your local parks.

'We haven't seen power this local for generations.

'The old dogma that said “Whitehall knows best” – it's gone.'

Bob Crow, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, said: 'This Government would privatise the air that we breathe if they thought that they could get away with it.

'If David Cameron seriously thinks he can flog off what's left of the family silver to the same greed merchants who created this crisis then he will have the fight of his life on his hands.'

Unison leader Dave Prentis added: 'The collapse of home care owners Southern Cross should act as a grim warning about what can happen when the private sector take over public services.'

Opponents: The RMT union's Bob Crow, left,
accused the government of selling of the family silver, while Unison's 
Dave Prentiss said Cameron had failed to learn the lessons of the 
collapse of Southern Cross care homes
