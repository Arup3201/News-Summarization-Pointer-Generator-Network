David Moyes will be told on Wednesday whether his bid to sign Arsenal’s Costa Rica forward Joel Campbell has been successful.

Real Sociedad want the 22-year-old Campbell either on loan or in an £8million permanent deal.

Villarreal, Benfica, Inter Milan, Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion are also interested but are waiting to hear if Arsenal are ready to let him leave.

Having loaned out Lukas Podolski and Yaya Sanogo, letting Campbell could be a risk going into the final months of the season.

Arsenal would prefer Campbell to stay in the Premier League to get him more experience if they do decide to loan him.

Campbell has made just four league appearances for the Gunners this season.
