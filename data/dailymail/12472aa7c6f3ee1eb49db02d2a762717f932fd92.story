They have been a bleak part of the Glasgow skyline for half a century.

But as part of the Commonwealth Games £10million opening ceremony, five of the city’s tower blocks will be demolished.

As organisers yesterday proudly unveiled their plan, it was slammed as ‘crass and insensitive’ and ‘a  spectacle on the cheap’.

The 15-second stunt to be screened around the world stands in stark contrast to the triumphant opening to the London Olympics in 2012.

Five tower blocks which have been part of Glasgow's skyline for almost 50 years will be blown up as part of the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony

Conservative
 Glasgow councillor David Meikle, whose mother grew up in the flats, 
said: ‘There has been no consultation about this, it is a few cultural 
bureaucrats thinking this sounds like an arty idea, but it is a very odd
 decision.

‘People watching 
in developing countries with substandard housing will not understand why
 these high-rise buildings are being blown up.

‘This is not the positive vision of Glasgow we should be portraying.’

Sir
 Menzies Campbell, former Liberal Democrats leader and ex  Commonwealth 
Games athlete, whose father oversaw construction of the flats, said: ‘It
 seems a really curious way to celebrate.’ 

Alison Irvine, author of a book based on the flats’ residents added: ‘It is crass and insensitive in the extreme.

‘It’s ignoring the thousands of people who had lived their lives there and their memories of the place.’

The sixth tower, currently occupied by asylum seekers, will be demolished by 2017.

The summer’s explosions will create 50,000 tons of twisted steel and rubble which will take years to be cleared away.

A Glasgow 2014 spokesman described the event as a ‘bold and dramatic statement of intent from a city focused on regeneration’.

But
 organisers admit that if there are safety issues, the demolition will 
be cancelled depriving the Games of its opening ceremony showpiece on 
July 23.

The blocks’ final 
few moments will be beamed live into the ceremony at Celtic Park on a 
giant 100-metre screen, as well as to an estimated TV audience of more 
than one billion people around the world.

Almost 900 homes near the site will 
be temporarily evacuated during the event and their residents invited to
 join in the opening celebrations at local venues.

Eileen
 Gallagher, independent director on the Glasgow 2014 board and chair of 
the ceremonies, culture and Queen’s baton relay committee, said: 'By 
sharing the final moments of the Red Road flats with the world as part 
of the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, Glasgow is proving it
 is a city that is proud of its history but doesn’t stand still.

'A city that is constantly regenerating, renewing and re-inventing itself.

'Glasgow’s
 story is always one of its people; their tenacity, their genuine 
warmth, their ambitions. Marking the end of Red Road is very much a 
celebration of all of those things.'

When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the Red Road flats were the highest in Europe at 292ft (89 metres).

They
 were designed to accommodate 4,700 people, but lately far fewer people 
remain there after decades of the properties slipping into decline.

Red
 Road resident Ali Mudassir, 21, said the tower blocks have been like 
family to him since he moved to Glasgow three years ago.

The student said: 'They have been a family to me, that's how I would describe it.

'It's
 been a great experience and they will be missed. The area will be 
entirely different after they've gone. But they have been here for 60 
years or something and it was time to get them demolished anyway.'

The Red Road flats have housed many 
asylum seekers over the years and the community was horrified by the 
deaths of a Russian family who jumped from their block in March 2010.

Serguei
 Serykh, 43, his wife Tatiana, and his 19-year-old stepson Stepan had 
apparently had their application to remain in the UK refused.

Campaigner
 Robina Qureshi said: 'For the Olympic games, they light a torch, and 
here in Glasgow, they are celebrating the start of the Commonwealth 
Games by blowing up the Red Road flats.

'It's
 highly insensitive and jars with the senses. Many of the sportsmen and 
women in the Commonwealth games from other countries may well be 
claiming asylum here, as so often happens, because of the threat of 
torture or denial of certain freedoms over there in their own countries.

'The
 Commonwealth committee clearly thinks it's a great idea to blow it up 
but clearly has no concept of the misery the Red Road flats caused to 
thousands of people from Glasgow and across the world. No change there 
then.'

The director of Positive Action in Housing said the Red Road flats were a 'place of despair' and should never have been built.

Games
 organisers believe the live blow-down will 'serve as an unforgettable 
statement of how Glasgow is confidently embracing the future and 
changing for the better', while being a 'respectful recognition and 
celebration of the role the Red Road flats have played in shaping the 
lives of thousands of city families' who lived there.

In 2006, director Andrea Arnold used the flats as the setting for her Scottish Bafta-winning film Red Road.

And
 in 2007 tightrope walker Didier Pasquette attempted to walk ninety 
metres above the ground on a thin metal wire stretching between three of
 the tower blocks, although due to unpredictable winds he was not able 
to complete the walk.

City council leader Gordon Matheson has written about the plans to each affected household.

He
 said: 'The opening ceremony will be the moment when we welcome the 
world to Glasgow. It will be a ceremony like no other, showcasing our 
city’s unique style and personality and with our people and communities 
at its very heart. We are going to wow the world, with the demolition of
 the Red Road flats set to play a starring role.

'Red
 Road has an iconic place in Glasgow’s history, having been home to 
thousands of families and dominating the city’s skyline for decades. 
Their demolition will all but mark the end of high-rise living in the 
area and is symbolic of the changing face of Glasgow, not least in terms
 of our preparations for the Games.'

David Zolkwer, head of ceremonies and artistic director for Glasgow 2014, said: 'Over the course of just a few seconds the city’s skyline will be transformed forever.

'It’s a bold and confident statement that says ‘bring on the future’, but it will also be an important opportunity for us to contemplate the many lives lived in the tower blocks over the last 50 years.'

Scotland’s Commonwealth Games Minister Shona Robison said: 'For many people, these Games are more than sport, they are a chance for regeneration, renewal and having better places to live and work.'.

It was once the gleaming future of modern city living. Now the Red Road estate is a dumping ground for asylum seekers.

Glasgow's Red Road housing estate epitomises the failed council housing policies of the 1960s which saw communities torn apart and moved into huge, impersonal tower blocks.

Glaswegian comedian Billy Connolly compared  the peripheral estates to 'deserts with windows'.

When they were built between 1964 and 1969, the steel-framed buildings - some up to 31 storeys high - contained 4,700 people and were the tallest residential blocks in Europe.

Council tenants in Glasgow's notorious tenement slums swarmed on to waiting lists to move into the spacious new flats on the estate.

But the rot soon set in. The first lifts failed in the 1970s. Then the graffiti artists arrived. The 1980s brought chronic drug dependency and spiralling crime.

Glasgow City Council handed two blocks with the worst reputation to the YMCA as part of an effort to improve the area.

In 2005 Glasgow Housing Association announced its intention to demolish one of the tallest blocks as part of a regeneration plan for the area.

Regeneration is well underway with new housing developments and the demolition process of the flats ongoing.

Six of the original eight tower blocks remain after two earlier demolitions, one in 2012 and one last year.

One block, Petershill Court, is currently used to house asylum seekers and will come down at a later date.
