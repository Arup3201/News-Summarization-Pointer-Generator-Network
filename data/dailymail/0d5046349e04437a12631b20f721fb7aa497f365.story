Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum's claims that she proved the existence of Sasquatch with DNA evidence last fall caused even some serious scientists to stand up and take notice. 

Now, they're rolling over and playing dead. A Houston newspaper reporter had the purposed Big Foot sample DNA tested by an independent geneticist and found Ketchum's 'evidence' isn't what she claims.

The sample contains mostly opossum DNA, mixed in with markers from other animals, according to the tests.

Houston Chronicle science reporter Eric Berger says there is no evidence that any of the DNA in the sample belongs to a Sasquatch or any other hominid cousins of humans.

Coming up empty: The much-vaunted 'proof' that that Bigfoot exists turned out to be false after an independent geneticist found no hominid DNA in a crumb sample

Houston Chronicle science reporter Eric Berger says a reputed sample of Bigfoot sample contains mostly opossum DNA - along with traces from other animals

When Ketchum released her 'scientific study' of Big Foot earlier this year, Berger hammered her for not submitting the paper to a credible peer-reviewed journal and not allowing mainstream researchers to verify her work.

Instead, she launched a journal of her own, the DeNovo Scientific Journal, and published her findings online and charged $30 to read the work.

'If Ketchum really had the goods she would have co-authored the paper with reputable scientists and gotten the work published in a reputable scientific journal,' Berger wrote in February.

'Instead she’s playing to an audience that doesn’t understand how science works, that wants to believe Bigfoot exists and is willing to send her some cash to further their delusions.'

However, Ketchum approached Berger and offered him definitive proof of her findings - she would let his friend, a top Houston geneticist, take a sample of her Big Foot DNA and test it himself.

Ketchum claims the sample came from a family of ten Sasquatches that lives in northern Michigan. She says the sample was taken from the crumbs left behind after the Bigfoots ate blueberry bagels.

She claims that her analysis of the Big Foot's DNA shows that they are distant cousins to human beings - the result of a non-human hominid mating with human women about 15,000 years ago.

Berger admits he allowed himself to get momentarily excited by the prospect of testing Sasquatch DNA.

'If the evidence backed up Ketchum’s claims, I had a blockbuster story. My geneticist source would have a hand in making the scientific discovery of the decade, or perhaps the century. Ketchum would be vindicated,' he wrote.

Instead, he says, rational science came crashing down. The sample contained nothing more than the remnants left behind by common forest animals.
