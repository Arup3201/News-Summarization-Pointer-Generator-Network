A mother-of-two died from cancer after she was treated by a surgeon being investigated over alleged botched operations

Michelle Flavelle was just 47 when she lost her fight against the illness.

She was treated by surgeon Ian Paterson at Solihull Hospital after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005.

But she fell ill again five years later, as the scandal over the surgeon’s 'cleavage-sparing' mastectomies began to break.

Michelle Flavelle was just 47 when she lost her fight against breast cancer. She was treated by surgeon Ian Paterson at Solihull Hospital, who has since been suspended by the GMC

Paterson is accused of performing experimental 'cleavage-sparing' mastectomies, in which tissue is left behind for cosmetic reasons, without permission

Paterson is accused of performing experimental ‘cleavage-sparing’ mastectomies, in which tissue is left behind for cosmetic reasons, on 700 patients without patients' permission.

It is alleged that this may raise the risk of them developing cancer by up to 50 per cent.

Tests revealed that Ms Flavelle, from Castle Bromwich, Birmingham, had secondary cancer that had spread to her liver.

Her best friends, Denise Philpotts and Debbie Jacques, last night told of their 'hatred' for Paterson, who has been suspended by the General Medical Council and is the subject of a police investigation.

'I hate him,', said Ms Jacques, 45. 'I feel angry - but Michelle never did.

'She was never recalled and we can never prove the operation is the reason the cancer came back,' added Ms Philpotts, 54.

'She accepted it. She would say: "You’ve got your health and I’ve got my wealth and together we’ll get on with it". She was so positive and strong.'

Paterson was suspended by the GMC in late 2012 following claims he carried out the 'cleavage-sparing” procedure on patients, said by her friends to have included Michelle, without their consent.

After surgery, tests revealed that Ms Flavelle had secondary cancer that had spread to her liver. It is alleged that cleavage-sparing mastectomies may raise the risk of developing cancer by up to 50 per cent

The surgery was not a recognised practice and left patients with a degree of breast tissue for cosmetic reasons.

A damning report last month revealed more than 200 of Paterson’s patients underwent 'suboptimal' mastectomies.

Lawyer Sir Ian Kennedy’s review also found their chances of suffering a cancer relapse within five years were more than double that of his patients who had full mastectomies.

Ms Flavelle's friends added that she was initially happy with the treatment provided by Paterson.

But they added that her friend, whose children are Jess, 17 and Ben, 21, 'started to ask questions' before her secondary cancer was diagnosed in April 2010.

Although Ms Flavelle was told she would only have 12 months to live after her secondary cancer was diagnosed, she was determined to make the most of her time

Ms Philpotts said: 'She had undergone reconstruction surgery not long before, and she could barely stand up afterwards. She had a pain in her stomach, too.

'After that diagnosis her life changed. She took early retirement and made a bucket list of what she wanted to do.

'She wanted to fly in a helicopter and go on loads of holidays.'

Although Ms Flavelle was told she would only have 12 months to live, she was determined to make the most of her time.

She organised weekends away, theatre trips and meals out. Ms Jacques said: 'Nothing was about dying - she was about living.

'She would tell you off if you cried. If we watched a sad DVD she would put a fiver on the table and say the last person to cry would win the money. It was always her.

'One weekend we went to Skegness and played pass the parcel with her fake boob and wig as a prize. She could always take the mickey out of herself.'

Ms Flavelle's friends say she exceeded all expectations and lived a 'happy and full life' for three years after her diagnosis

Ms Flavelle exceeded all expectations and lived a happy and full life for three years after her diagnosis.

But her health deteriorated last summer and she died at the John Taylor Hospice in Erdington in August.

Now her friends are organising a black-tie charity ball in her memory, to mark what would have been her 48th birthday.

'After she died we were lost,' said Ms Jacques. 'But we knew we wanted to do something for her.

'That’s when Denise came up with the idea of doing a ball.

'We knew it had to be a big party, because if Michelle was here that’s definitely what she would have wanted. She loved a party.

The event will raise money for the John Taylor Hospice, and Breast Friends Sutton and Tamworth, a cancer support group based at Good Hope Hospital.

Both charities helped Michelle during her illness.

'I don’t think we could have done this without Michelle behind us,' said Denise.

'It will be her first birthday that she won’t be here,' said Debbie. 'She was a party girl. We wanted to do something in her memory to give something back.'
