Manchester United legend David Beckham believes it is 'sad' that Danny Welbeck has left the club and predicts he will be a 'great signing' for Arsenal.

Welbeck, 23, completed a £16million deadline-day move from Old Trafford to the Emirates after United boss Louis van Gaal deemed the England striker surplus to requirements.

And Beckham - who won 115 England caps, including 58 as captain, and scored 85 goals in 394 games for United - is upset to see a member of the Three Lions squad leave United to further his career elsewhere.

'We always worry about the young talent coming through,' Beckham told BBC Sport as part of his role as a Sainsbury's Active Kids ambassador, 'and seeing Danny (Welbeck) leave United - I'm not a manager and won't be a manager in the near future but to see him leave Manchester United, it's sad.

'But obviously the manager knows what he is doing, he's doing what he feels best for Manchester United.

'And with Danny being such a young kid and growing up at Manchester United - I think it's a great signing for Arsenal of course - but to see him leave is obviously sad to see.

'I'm not a manager - and won't be manager of Manchester United in the next 10 years - and that's down to the (current) manager there but it's sad to see him leave.'

Welbeck scored 29 goals in 142 games for United and he has netted eight times for England in 26 matches.
