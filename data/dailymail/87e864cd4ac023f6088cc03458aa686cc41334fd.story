He only just landed back in Sydney after a trip to Dubai, and radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands is already in hot water.

The 43-year-old was stopped for speeding by police on his way back from the airport to his St. Ives  mansion on Monday morning.

The Kiis 1065 host admitted to his listeners on his breakfast show that he broke the law, telling them he was going 20kms over the 60km speed limit, according to the Daily Telegraph.

In hot water: Kyle Sandilands was stopped by police for speeding on Monday morning. The shock jock was travelling 20kms over the 60km limit the same day he had arrived in Sydney after a week in Dubai

Not his fault: The Kyle And Jackie O Show host joked that the speed limit 'was too slow in Australia' in comparison to in Dubai

He added: 'I was flying, I thought I was still in Dubai.'

Kyle explained he was pulled over at around 11.30 in the morning while travelling in his black 4WD with girlfriend Imogen Anthony and several male friends to his northern suburbs abode.

He may now be slapped with a $435 fine and could have four demerit points stripped from his license.

Wide load: Kyle pushed an airport trolley piled high with huge suitcases as he left the terminal 

Covered-up: Model Imogen was swathed in an all-black ensemble, including a cap on top of a large scarf wrapped around her head and chest

Kyle, who owns a fleet of some of the world's most expensive cars, including a Rolls Royce thought to be worth close to $1m, was fined for not having his driver's licence with him  after being pulled over in Sydney's Kings Cross in his black Lamborghini back in 2012.

He was also caught speeding back in 2007, and at the time was slapped with a $500 fine and lost four demerit points leading to a reported three month driving ban.

According the Daily Telegraph, on this occasion he was going more than 35km/h over the speed limit.

The radio host reportedly did not contest the ticket and said that he would 'cop it sweet'.

Just moments before the incident on Monday, the broadcast star was leaving Sydney International Airport with Imogen and friends.

With his girlfriend by his side, he was spotted wheeling the couple's luggage through the terminals.

Pop of colour: Imogen paired her plain black clothing with bright orange wedge Adidas heels and a matching Hermes handbag

All smiles: The blonde looked cheerful despite the long-haul flight

Helping hand: A scarf-wearing Kyle gets some help loading the huge cases into the boot of the car

The pair appeared to be well rested despite their near 14-hour flight after no doubt flying Business or First Class.

Makeup free Imogen was dressed all in black except her bright orange Adidas trainers. She was seen carrying a matching orange Hermes handbag along with a shopping bag from lingerie store Victoria's Secret.

Meanwhile, Kyle was also dressed in black and accessorised with a grey and white checked scarf and a baseball cap.

Kyle had been in the United Arab Emirates city with Imogen and his breakfast radio co-host Jackie O, where the duo broadcast their popular program from for one week.

All aboard: Friends helped the couple load their suitcases into the back of Kyle's black four-wheel drive

Italian stallion: The stoutly radio personality is known for his love of fast cars, including his cherry red Ferrari
