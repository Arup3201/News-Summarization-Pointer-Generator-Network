There are moments when a parent feels particularly proud of their child, and there are moments when a child looks up to a parent with the utmost respect.

In the case of Scott Byrne and his daughter Jen, they experienced both on Wednesday when they flew their first flight together as co-pilots for American Airlines.

The father-daughter team got the opportunity to work as First Officer and Captain on a flight from Chicago to Dallas-Forth Worth, and then on to John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California.

Professionalism ruled the day, and they were so busy with the pre-flight checks, and then take-off itself that Scott, who joined American Airlines in 1990, said he almost forgot who was sitting next to him.

'Jenny was such a natural. She did an absolutely fantastic job. And it's my 28-year-old daughter. I am so proud,' he told ABC.

The day had even more significance. 'It also marked the one-year anniversary since I've joined American,' said Jen, originally from Algonquin, Illinois.

Based in Chicago, she is trained to fly Boeing 757s and 767s and is also a U.S. Air Force Reservist with the 89th Airlift Squadron out of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.

She has also worked for SkyWest Airlines and as a DC-8 Flight Operations intern with UPS.

On the day, Jen hoped for an extra smooth landing to impress the man she refers to as her 'hero'.

'I was just praying it would be a good landing,' she said.

With safety always a priority, the landing was indeed a good one.

'I looked over at him and he was smiling and it was the best feeling in the world,' said Jen, who has wanted to be a pilot since she was eight years old.

With the two of them working side by side, there was one person who wasn't going to be left out of this special family occasion.

Mom came along for the ride too - though only as a passenger.

Both Scott and Jen credit her for getting Jen where she is today. She helped her achieve her dreams by keeping her dedicated when things got tough.

'Every credit goes to my wife,' said Scott.
