A small-town police chief from Ohio, who drew a following with his blunt, frequently humorous Facebook commentary has resigned days after being suspended.

Brimfield Township trustees accepted David Oliver's resignation at a meeting on Friday. He didn't attend.

Some residents demanded to know more about the complaint and resulting gender discrimination investigation that led to Oliver's suspension, but township officials refused to discuss details and cited attorney-client privilege.

The Brimfield Police Department, near Kent, in northeast Ohio, serves about 10,000 people, but its Facebook page became one of the most-liked local law enforcement pages in the country thanks to Oliver's conversational posts and increasing popularity. 

Cop-out: Brimfield police Chief David Oliver  became a social media celebrity because of his posts on the department Facebook page, has now resigned after being suspended without pay for two weeks

Popular policing: Oliver's department’s 177,000 Facebook 'likes' place the tiny department’s popularity ahead of every U.S. police agency except New York City. The Facebook page has now been removed

The likes on the page have grown from a few thousand to more than 177,000 in less than three years.

Oliver announced his departure Friday morning in a lengthy post on his individual Facebook page, in which he said that untrue allegations had circulated and that his management style was used against him. 

He didn't specify the accusations against him but said that he 'never once hugged an employee for 'dirty' reasons' and that most employees never complained of being 'bullied' under his admittedly forceful leadership style. 

'What you all are seeing now are some disgruntled people who are taking shots at me and have been since the (Facebook) page got bigger,' he wrote. 

'Two are current employees, some I have fired in the past and some just hate me because of my personality. Whatever the reason, they are out in force, like vultures, enjoying the scene.'

Oliver, who joined the police department in 1994 and became chief in 2004, also said that his work has taken a toll on him and that he suffers increasingly unpredictable panic attacks.

Outspoken: Oliver, who has led Brimfield’s department for more than 20 years, has made international news for his daily Facebook rants to his followers

Keeping schtum: The normally outspoken Oliver said Tuesday that he is prevented from revealing the reasons behind the suspension

In a sign of his popularity, the post drew about 1,000 comments within two hours, nearly all of them messages of support, well-wishes or gratitude.

Oliver became a local celebrity with catchphrases such as 'No mopes,' a reference to his preferred term for criminals and other ne'er-do-wells. He also found his share of critics, who said he was using work time inappropriately or shouldn't have been discussing criminal suspects via social media.

Township officials at the meeting praised Oliver's work and emphasized he made a decision to do what was best for him. 

They said he could have returned to work after a two-week suspension and would have gone through diversity and anti-discrimination training that they now plan to require for all township employees.

'We didn't get rid of him,' trustee Charles Sprague said.

Another trustee, Mike Kostensky, said Oliver told him he's done with law enforcement.

The trustees named Capt. Chris Adkins as interim chief. 

Police squad: Oliver said he may eventually will talk about the circumstances surrounding the suspension, and he hinted that it largely was brought about by his “hands-on” management style

In postings interspersed with community messages and rants, the former  chief took criminals to task and other ne'er-do-wells - his preferred term was 'mopes', appropriated from police TV shows and an old colleague who used it - for the stupid, the lazy and the outright unlawful.

Even an ill-considered parking choice could spur a Facebook flogging.

'If you use a handicapped space and you jump out of the vehicle, all healthy-like, as if someone is dangling free cheeseburgers on a stick, expect people to stare at you and get angry,' Oliver wrote in 2012.

'You are milking the system and it aggravates those of us who play by the rules. Ignoring us does not make you invisible. We see you, loser.'

His postings were among the most-liked local law enforcement pages in the country, trailing only New York, Boston and Philadelphia police, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police Center for Social Media.

Not bad for a guy who initially hoped maybe 500 locals would pay attention when he noticed other businesses' pages and decided to start his own five years ago.

His Facebook messages extended that open-door policy online for conversations about road closures, charity events, lost pets and whatever else crosses his mind.

Some were serious, such as salutes to slain officers and updates during school threat investigations.

Others were light-like, like the attempt to find an escaped swine's owner with an unusual APB - an 'All-Pig Bulletin' - or his promise to 'ticket' child bicyclists with coupons for free ice cream if they wear helmets.

And, of course, there's crime. One posting berated a man accused of physically assaulting a woman and two children.

In another, Oliver suggested that hiding near an occupied police K-9 vehicle wasn't a shoplifting suspect's smartest move.

Resident Mark Mosley, a daily reader, said he liked such 'humorous arrest stories' best.

'It's one of those things, like you can't fix stupid,' Mosley said.

His officers and others said the online character of the chief, a big, beefy guy, matched real life.
