England captain Wayne Rooney has been holding player-only meetings in a bid to put the summer's disastrous World Cup behind them.

This has been a long, testing summer for the Three Lions, whose miserable campaign in Brazil led to the development of an understandably downbeat mood in the camp.

There were promising signs on Monday night, though, as Roy Hodgson's men kicked off their European Championship qualifying campaign with a 2-0 win against much-fancied Switzerland.

Captain fantastic: England skipper Wayne Rooney has been holding player-only meetings

Rooney believes it was England's most accomplished showing since they overcame Brazil 2-1 at Wembley in February 2013 and was quick to praise his team-mates after the St Jakob-Park encounter.

While the Three Lions skipper won his 97th cap, the rest of the line-up had just 186 appearances between them - a lack of experience which led him to hold player-led meetings.

'We have worked hard and, to be fair, the players have taken a lot of responsibility,' Rooney said.

'We have had meetings among ourselves, just players in the rooms, watching videos and discussing how we can do better as a team.

'Obviously the manager gives us our game plan, but because we don't spend that much time together as a team we need to know and feel confident in what we're doing as a team together.

'In the meetings, you're having the players speak up who wouldn't normally speak up when coaches are there.

'They've been good and I think the players have really stood up. We've worked hard.'

An outstanding performer in Basle was deep-lying midfielder Fabian Delph, starting his first match for England having only made his debut as a second-half substitute against Norway last week.

Delph was booked early on and looked in danger of a red card at one stage, but grew in composure and presence as the game progressed.

'He was brilliant,' Rooney said of the Aston Villa midfielder. 'His energy, he took the ball. Early on he had to be a bit careful.

'The referee said to me at half-time to have a word with him, but I think he knew anyway.

'I spoke to him and told him just to be careful because I think one more and he would have probably been off.

'But he played really well, took the ball, played with confidence and showed what a top player he is.'
