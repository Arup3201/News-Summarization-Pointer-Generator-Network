Swansea manager Garry Monk believes Jonjo Shelvey should not face disciplinary action after appearing to catch Liverpool defender Emre Can in the face with a stray elbow on Monday night.

Shelvey caught Can in the side of the head during the first half of Swansea's 4-1 Barclays Premier League defeat at Liverpool and, although the incident went unpunished at the time, the Swansea midfielder could face retrospective action from the FA if referee Andre Marriner highlights it in his match report.

Monk said after the game he had yet to view the incident properly, but he defended his player on Tuesday morning after seeing footage of it on the team bus on the way home from Liverpool.

'There was a motion towards the player, but it's not clear,' Monk said at his press conference ahead of the Swans' trip to QPR on New Year's Day.

'I spoke to Jonjo on the way home and he said his intention was not to catch the player at all.

'He said the player was tugging on him and he was just trying to push him away from him to move it.

'I don't think it was an intentional elbow at all and the referee was perfectly placed.

'No-one had a better view of the incident than him. He felt it didn't warrant any more action and the game went on.

'There were no complaints from any of the players afterwards, so you have to trust the referee made the right decision - and we thought that he did.'

Liverpool's England forward Raheem Sterling faces a similar anxious wait to see if he could also be punished after tangling with Swansea's Argentina central defender Federico Fernandez during the closing stages of the match.

The 20-year-old slapped Fernandez in the face, but Reds boss Brendan Rodgers said after the game that the referee dealt with both situations sensibly and did not expect either Sterling or Shelvey to face FA action.

Monk agreed with Rodgers' assessment of both incidents and said Sterling did not deserve a red card for raising his arm to Fernandez.

'It's the same situation,' Monk said. 'Yes, there is a motion towards Federico's face, but for me the referee and the linesman were the best placed people to see.

'The referee looked straight at it and decided it didn't warrant any action.

'Does it warrant a sending off? Not for me, but again you have to trust that the referee's in the right place and doing the right thing.'

The incident came during the closing stages of Liverpool's 4-1 Premier League win against Swansea 

Swansea's heaviest defeat of 2014 saw Liverpool leapfrog them into eighth place in the midst of what has been a heavy festive programme for Monk's men, who have already had trips to Hull and Anfield and must now visit Loftus Road and then Saturday's third-round FA Cup opponents Tranmere in the space of 48 hours.

'In terms of preparation, it's difficult,' Monk said.

'It's nice to have a week's build-up to get more details into the players, but I've played in these periods and I love the quick turnover of games.

'I think players do enjoy it and they're used to it in this country.

'But physically it is difficult to churn out top-level performances in such a short space of time.

'There's a higher risk of injuries at this level, with the intensity and the physicality of games, but that's the challenge for all of us.

'We've got to deal with it, and the medical staff have put programmes in place for the players for their recovery.'
