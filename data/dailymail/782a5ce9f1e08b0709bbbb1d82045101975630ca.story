Britain is undermining the rights of gipsies and travellers to housing which is ‘culturally acceptable’ to them, Europe’s human rights watchdog has warned.

Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe, also said the eviction of travellers from the illegal Dale Farm camp last year was a violation of their rights, ‘highly regrettable’ and must never happen again.

Mr Hammarberg’s comments emerged yesterday after it was revealed he wrote to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, stating: ‘The continuing shortage of adequate permanent and transit sites for gipsies and travellers living in caravans is a priority area to address.’

He said providing such housing was a 
‘pre-condition for the enjoyment of other human rights, including the 
rights to education and health’.

The Council of Europe also runs the 
European Court of Human Rights, which David Cameron is currently trying 
to reform following its repeated interference in decisions made by 
British courts and Parliament.

The court’s attempts to overrule 
democratic institutions in this country have provoked widespread demands
from Tory backbenchers for Britain to pull out of the Council of 
Europe.

Mr Hammarberg’s comments prompted 
criticism from Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, in Essex. She said: 
‘This is another disgraceful example of Europe using the facade of human
rights to meddle in our domestic affairs and attack laws passed by our 
Parliament. The Commissioner should show respect for the work the 
Government is doing rather than attack it.’

She added: ‘Europe’s unaccountable 
bureaucrats know nothing about planning matters in this country and 
after the problems at Dale Farm, they are out of touch with the British 
people.’

The latest statistics show that the number of caravans on unauthorised sites increased from 728 to 2,395 between 2000 and 2010.

Around 80 families illegally camped at Dale Farm in Basildon, Essex, were evicted last October after ten years of legal battles.

The process cost taxpayers more than 
£6million as travellers exploited every last legal avenue to try to 
stave off the bailiffs.

Despite the intervention of a United Nations 
human rights expert, appeals by actress Vanessa Redgrave and attempts by
protest groups to block the evictions from Europe’s largest illegal 
traveller site, they went ahead.

However, within weeks, some of the 
evicted travellers were back with their caravans, either on nearby 
pitches legally occupied by travellers or in nearby lanes.

Referring to the evictions, Mr 
Hammarberg said: ‘The rights to adequate housing of travellers in 
Basildon have already been violated once. The authorities should ensure 
that no further violations take place and should work responsibly 
towards a solution that is acceptable for all.’

The Swedish-born Commissioner for 
Human Rights singled out Mr Pickles as he published a 250-page report on
gipsy human rights across Europe which was severely critical of 
Britain.
