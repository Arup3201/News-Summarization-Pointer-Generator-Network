Property financier Brian Gilmour has outlined a £45million blueprint to make struggling Ayr United a Premiership force in six years.

Glasgow-based Gilmour, 44, is in takeover talks with Somerset Park chairman Lachlan Cameron.

If he succeeds, he will pursue plans for a new 10,000-seat stadium, housing and entertainment village, delivering an estimated 900 jobs and ploughing over £100million into the local economy.

Built in the town's Heathfield area, close to Somerset Park, the £10m sports and entertainment village would be funded by a development of 320 private and affordable homes over the two sites.

Seeking a swift resolution to 12 months of negotiations, Gilmour - the managing director of social housing lenders Carduus - wants to relocate Ayr to their new state-of-the-art home by 2018, targeting the top six of the Premiership by 2021.

The club are currently battling to avoid relegation to League Two, and sacked manager Mark Roberts this week, yet Gilmour told Sportsmail: 'There is no reason why Ayr United should not be playing in the top half of the Premiership.

'Lachlan Cameron and I have spoken about the principle of me having majority ownership in Ayr United.

'I think I have offered a good price for the business.

'Lachlan is aware of my proposals to develop a new stadium via the existing ground and the new land the club have an existing option on.

'We have got pretty close to the terms we want to lay out.

'Lachlan is a good guy, he wants Ayr to succeed. I want to pay him what I think is a fair price and at the end of the process I want to control an Ayr United with no debt.

'If I succeed I would like to see a new stadium built in three years. I want it to be a place where people want to go. Ayr United need to be an intrinsic part of the community.

'We propose to build around 320 homes and the whole cost of the project will be £45m.

'That will generate 900 full-time, permanent jobs and will benefit the local economy to the tune of £110m.

'South Ayrshire Council have been very good and are very keen for Ayr United to have a new stadium.'

Local roofing contractor Hugh Clarke also discussed plans for a possible Ayr bid in September. However, Gilmour has employed architects to cost and develop his detailed plans and believes a sports village, incorporating a stadium, family entertainment and restaurants, holds the key to generating the funds required to reach the Premiership.

'I am laying the foundations for that to happen,' he added.

'The one thing I firmly believe is that every single person who wants to be involved in delivering Premiership football for Ayr United is already at the club.

'If they want to be there they can be there.

'It's hard work. Anybody at the club, in the academy or the staff, who wants to put the effort in can be in the Premiership.'

Speaking from America Ayr chairman Lachlan Cameron confirmed discussions with Brian Gilmour, but was reluctant to comment further saying: 'I have spoken to Brian, but there is really nothing to report on it. There is nothing to talk about.'
