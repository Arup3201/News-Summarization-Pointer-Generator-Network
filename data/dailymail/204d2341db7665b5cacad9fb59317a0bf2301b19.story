A gang of armed robbers who posed as a girl to lure their victims to secluded areas where they robbed them at knifepoint have been jailed.

Daniel Beeson and Tyrone Webb, both 18 and from Stratford, east London, sent messages and photos of a woman to trick young men into meeting for sex.

The victims were ambushed in secluded alleyways before arriving at addresses in Wickford, Essex, and Stratford.

They were threatened with a six-inch kitchen knife and stripped of their mobile phones, banks cards, keys and even clothing.

Beeson’s girlfriend Lorna Yeates, 21, joined the con by luring one victim into a dark alleyway where he was jumped by Beeson and Webb who told him: 'Shut up or I’m going to stab you and you’re going to die and no one will know you’re here.'

When police searched Yeates’ home in Wickford stolen items from a number of victims were discovered.

The gang had posed as a fictitious girl called ‘Jess’ and used stolen phones to lure in new victims through the instant messaging service available on Blackberry mobile phones.

Lorna Yeates was jailed for 14 months after admitting one count of robbery and four counts of handling goods stolen

All three appeared in the dock at Basildon Crown Court yesterday facing charges relating to the robberies carried out in March and April.

Beeson pleaded guilty to four counts of robbery, one of wounding relating to a knife injury one of the victims sustained during a robbery and a further charge of perverting the course of justice.

Webb pleaded guilty to six robberies while Yeates admitted one count of robbery and four counts of handling goods stolen.

Judge David Owen-Jones sentenced Beeson and Webb to six years imprisonment each while Yeates was jailed for 14 months.

Judge Owen-Jones told the court: 'These were appalling, shocking and terrifying robberies of young men who were lured by Blackberry messages with photographs of women and the promise of sexual relations.

'They travelled to Wickford where they were taken into an alleyway and robbed at knifepoint.

'It’s clear it was a very frightening experience for all of these young men.'

Investigating
officer, Detective Sergeant Mike Wilkinson, of Basildon CID, said: 
'This was a protracted and, at times, complex enquiry made the more 
difficult by the number of mobile phones used by the suspects.

Basildon Crown Court (pictured) heard how the gang had posed as a fictitious girl called 'Jess' and used stolen phones to lure in new victims

'During their offending they would frequently swap SIM cards and use phones stolen in previous robberies in the commission of future ones.

'I would like to add that these robberies would have been extremely distressing for the victims who had been lured to Wickford under false pretences.

'I would advise people to think twice before making arrangements to meet people they are unfamiliar with in locations that they don’t know.'
