Probe: Mark Thompson becomes CEO of the New York Times 
Company next month - but a scandal at his former employers, the BBC, hangs
over him

A growing scandal at Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, over allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved TV host has cast a shadow over the arrival of the New York Times' new boss.

Mark Thompson left his position as the BBC's Director General to take up the role of the Times company's chief executive, but now a police inquiry into the accusations could force him to answer tough questions as he begins the job in November.

In a case that has been referred to as 'Britain's Sandusky scandal', a group of alleged victims - some as young as 13 - have claimed that late TV host Jimmy Savile abused them over six decades - during which time he was employed by the broadcaster.

Savile was the eccentric host for BBC favourites, including Jim'll Fix It, where he granted children's 
wishes over its 20-year run, and Top of the Pops, a popular chart music show that aired for 
more than four decades.

Savile, who was knighted in 1990, died last year at the age of 84 after a visit to hospital with pneumonia.

Now,
scores of men and women have stepped forward to claim he abused them 
when they were young after rival broadcaster ITV reported on the 
allegations earlier this month.

Much
of Savile's career involved working with children, including visiting 
schools and hospital wards, and many of his victims have claimed he 
seized these opportunities to molest them.

The
Metropolitan Police in London has confirmed they are investigating 40 
cases involving incidents across the country dating back to 1959, yet 
they have received a total of 340 lines of inquiry.

While he was interviewed by police in his lifetime, allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Former BBC executives admitted there had been rumors about Savile, but dismissed suggestions they had turned a blind eye to the indiscretions of celebrities.

Some of the alleged abuse is believed to have taken place on the BBC premises.

On Sunday, Times' former executive editor Bill Keller wrote a column drawing a parallel between Savile and Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky, sentenced to life in jail for molesting children.

'Whether the BBC fell short in its reporting and missed the story or had the story and lacked the nerve, it is a significant embarrassment, compounded by the hard question of why the widespread rumors of Savile's behavior were ignored for so long,' Keller wrote.

The allegations mean that Thompson, who joined the BBC as a trainee in 1979, will not be able to leave the job behind just yet, as he may become embroiled in the police and parliamentary inquiries.

Thompson quickly rose up the ranks at 
the broadcaster, working on shows such Newsnight, a nightly current 
affairs program known for its analysis and examinations of the country's
politicians.

In fact, Newsnight had worked on its own investigation into the Savile allegations in December last year but cancelled it, leading to accusations of a cover up.

The BBC has denied this and is currently investigating the matter and cooperating with police.

Newsnight's
editor, Peter Rippon, said they had shelved the program after public 
prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence.

An
article in the New York Times on Saturday noted Thompson was at the top
job at the BBC when the Newsnight investigation was dropped.

Thompson, 55,
said in a statement: 'I was not notified or briefed about the Newsnight
investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to 
complete and air the investigation.

Earlier this month, ITV, a rival network to the BBC, aired a documentary, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile. On the program, which was researched by a former police detective, several women claimed they had been molested by the long-serving TV host after he obtained access to them through his shows and charity work.

Ex-BBC staff said bosses had 'turned a blind eye' to his behaviour and that it had been an 'open secret'. A revered advocate of child protective services, Esther Rantzen, said she had heard rumours that he was inappropriate with children. And one BBC radio boss, Douglas Muggeridge, called for an investigation into the allegations in 1973 as he feared them coming out in the press - but did not make full inquiries as 'he felt they lacked weight'.

It also emerged that current affairs program Newsnight had planned to air an investigative report into the allegations in December 2011, but later dropped it. Bosses denied a cover up, instead insisting they shelved the program after public 
prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence.

Following the documentary, an investigation was launched and other victims - both men and women - started coming forward. Witnesses to the alleged incidents, including a hospital worker who claimed she saw Savile molest a brain-damaged patient in 1971, also spoke out.

Police said they are investigating 40 
cases dating back to 1959, yet 
they have received a total of 340 lines of inquiry.

Savile, who died last year aged 84, was interviewed by police in his lifetime but investigations were dropped due to lack of evidence.

'I
have no reason to doubt the public statement by the program's editor, 
Peter Rippon, that the decision not to pursue the investigation was 
entirely his, and that it was made solely for journalistic reasons.

'During my time as director general of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile.'

There is no evidence to suggest that Thompson knew about the decision to axe the program or about Savile's alleged behaviour. Colleagues insist he had nothing to do with the editorial process of Newsnight.

'The chances that Mark interfered in the 
decisions of Newsnight as to whether or not they were going to broadcast
the story are precisely zero,' said Mark Damazer, a long-time colleague
at the BBC.

In the years when their careers overlapped, Thompson was in the news and current affairs area of the company rather than in its entertainment arm where Savile worked until retiring in 1994.

George Entwistle, who took over as director general from Thompson, said the allegations have 'truly shocked' him.

He added: 'If there are lessons we can learn then we must do so to ensure that the mistakes of the past should never be repeated.'

A representative for the New York Times would not comment on the BBC investigations.

Yet the situation is far from ideal for Thompson or the New York Times, Kelly McBride, a senior faculty member for ethics at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school and media think tank, told Reuters.

'It really depends what else comes out and how closely he can be tied to the scandal at the BBC,' said McBride. 'If it's just guilt by association most of the time organizations are fine with that.'

Thompson was named CEO of the New York Times Co in August, capping an eight-month search for an executive to lead the company after chief executive Janet Robinson was abruptly ousted last year.

He was hired by the Times Co in part 
because of his extensive experience in video and digital, and because of
his skills in corporate diplomacy.

While at the BBC, Thompson helped develop the digital iPlayer, which enables viewers to catch up on missed programs online for free. It was considered a huge hit among those viewing the Olympics.

He has been lauded for guiding the public broadcaster through morale problems, assaults from Rupert Murdoch's media empire and threats to its funding by the British government.

Indeed, News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, whose own company's U.K. phone-hacking scandal has been covered extensively by both the BBC and the New York Times, seized on the opportunity to jab at his rivals on Twitter.

'Look to new CEO to shake up NYT unless recalled to BBC to explain latest scandal,' Murdoch tweeted.
