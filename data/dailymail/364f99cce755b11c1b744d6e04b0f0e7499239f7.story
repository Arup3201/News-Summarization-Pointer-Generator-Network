Louis van Gaal hopes to conclude negotiations with Manchester United in the next few days, aware that potential members of his coaching staff are under pressure to clarify their positions with current employers.

Guus Hiddink will take over as Holland head coach after the World Cup and Frank Hoek, Van Gaal’s goalkeeping coach, has promised to tell Hiddink today whether he will remain with the national team or move with Van Gaal to United.

Another pressing issue for Van Gaal, it seems, is an assurance that transfer funds will extend to the signing of the three German players he thinks United need. As well as Bayern Munich’s Toni Kroos, Van Gaal wants Borussia Dortmund’s Marco Reus and Mats Hummels.

Senior sources at United are reluctant to confirm the appointment of a permanent successor to David Moyes is imminent, however.

They argue that it might make sense to be patient and wait for someone such as Carlo Ancelotti to become available.

Other
 sources expect the process to accelerate, with Van Gaal very much the 
favourite now that Ancelotti has guided his Real Madrid side to the 
Champions League final.

United
 are keen to see interim player-manager Ryan Giggs and the Class of 92 —
 namely Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville — remain part of any 
future coaching set-up in the belief that ‘continuity is important’.

With
 Van Gaal keen to bring in a team of his own, including Hoek, a 
potential for conflict in negotiations with United has been highlighted.

Leader: Wayne Rooney will hope he is handed the captain's armband next season

In charge: Ryan Giggs is currently the interim manager at Manchester United

In
 Holland, though, sources close to Van Gaal insist it is not an 
insurmountable problem, given that the 62-year-old will see the value in
 having individuals such as Giggs involved at the club.

As
 for his three German targets, their combined cost could be in excess of
 £100million — before United even look at other signings, including Luke
 Shaw and Adam Lallana.

They
 would certainly amount to an expensive trio, even though the cost could
 be reduced if Shinji Kagawa returns to Dortmund as part of any deal. He
 joined United from the German club in  June 2012.

Van Gaal certainly wants talks to be concluded one way or the other as soon as possible.

He
 is aware that there is a small window of a few weeks when he could 
devote some time to planning for next season at United before his 
attention has to turn to Holland and the World Cup.
