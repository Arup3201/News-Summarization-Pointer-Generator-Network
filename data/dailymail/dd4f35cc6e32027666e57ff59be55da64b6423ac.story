Jailed: Terrence Tucker, 46, groomed the girl before repeatedly assaulting her in a string of attacks

A child rapist who tried to explain blame his son for his sexual attacks after his victim fell pregnant has been jailed for 15 years.   

Terrence Tucker, 46, groomed the teenage girl before repeatedly assaulting her in a string of attacks which only came to light when she fell pregnant.

Police collected DNA samples which revealed that Tucker was the father of the child, but he blamed his son, who suffers from severe learning disabilities, for the offence, Exeter Crown Court heard.

His victim terminated the pregnancy. 

Tucker denied four counts of rape and three of sexual activity with a child but was found guilty by a jury at Truro Crown Court last month.

He was described as showing 'no remorse' during the trial. 

Sentencing him to 15 years in prison, Judge Simon Carr said: 'You were convicted of the systematic abuse of a girl who you groomed and abused from the age of 12 or 13.

'You started with sexual assaults to see how she would react and if you could get away with it and when she did not complain you progressed to rape, culminating in a pregnancy when she was 16.

'She suffered the further emotional trauma of a termination. I saw her give evidence and it is perfectly clear she has been devastated and will be for the rest of her life.

'During the trial you showed no remorse at all and I could not fail to notice that given the DNA evidence, you attempted to blame your own son for the offence, knowing he suffers from severe learning difficulties.'

The jury heard the victim revealed the abuse when she fell pregnant. 

Mr Robert Linford, defending, said Tucker of Liskeard, Cornwall, has very low intelligence and is unable to read or write.

He said: 'He has his own learning disabilities and is of previous good character.

'His inability to read and write means his sentence will be one which is unusually difficult to bear.'

Evidence: Police collected DNA samples which revealed that Tucker was the father of the child, but he blamed his son, who suffers from severe learning disabilities, the court heard. Above, file image of Exeter Crown Court
