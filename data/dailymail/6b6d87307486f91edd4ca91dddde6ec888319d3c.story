A range of contact lenses has been developed that the makers claim can make the wearer look younger and more attractive.

The Acuvue Define lenses have a pigment inside that helps to define the border around the iris, known as the limbal ring.

This ring naturally fades with age and poor health, so improving the definition is said to make us look more youthful, and healthier.

The eye's have it: The limbal ring is often known as nature's eye-liner'. The new lenses (pictured right) claim to make eyes look younger by defining the edge of a person's iris, a quality said to have an anti-aging effect

Product designer Angie Bowers said: 'The limbal ring is often known as "nature's eye-liner".

'In fact, studies show faces with a more distinctive definition around the limbal ring are rated as more attractive.

'Since a limbal ring usually fades over time, a defined one can suggest youthfulness and good health.'

A limbal ring is a dark circle that appears around the iris of your eye - the coloured part.

The rings are typically less than a millimetre thick, and are associated with youthfulness - the rings are darker when a person is a child, and fade with age.

Some studies have also claimed that a more prominent limbal ring is a sign of attractiveness.

The lenses can be used by people with dark or lighter eyes, she added.

Lenses for lighter eyes are described as giving a 'sparkle effect' and those for darker eyes are described as giving a 'shimmer effect'. 

In 2011, researchers from the University of California Irvine conducted a study in which participants were shown a set of 80 pairs of faces and asked to rate them for attractiveness.

The faces in each pair were the same except one had been digitally altered to have a darkened limbal ring.

Age fades the colour in a person's eye (stock image of elderly man pictured), but if someone has high cholesterol there can be a white ring in the clear cornea and this deposit dulls the iris colour too

The pattern on the Natural Shimmer lens (top) gives it more depth and provides an intense effect whereas the pattern on the Natural Sparkle lens (bottom) provides a luminous and brightening effect

The researchers found that the male and female participants, who were not aware of what had been changed, overwhelmingly preferred the photos showing the darker limbal rings. 

The scientists, who published their research in the journal Evolutionary Psychology, suggested that we have evolved to find faces with more defined limbal rings as more attractive because they signal that the person is young and healthy enough to reproduce with.

Dr Robert Burriss, a psychologist at Northumbria University who specialises in attractiveness, said: 'The limbal ring fades over time, so it is used - unconsciously - as an indicator of age.

'This is interesting because we perceive most other indicators of age - wrinkled skin, grey hair, voice, changes in posture - consciously.

'But I'm pretty sure most people have never given their limbal rings a second thought!'

Consultant ophthalmologist Julian Stevens said there is nothing we can do to prevent the natural fading of the limbal ring with the passage of time - but certain conditions can make it worse.

'The iris pigment can fall out over the years, so the colour fades,' he said.

'But if someone has high cholesterol there can be a white ring in the clear cornea and this deposit dulls the iris colour too.'
