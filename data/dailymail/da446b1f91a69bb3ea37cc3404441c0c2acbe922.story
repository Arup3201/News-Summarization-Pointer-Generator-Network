A South Dakota mother was arrested Thursday after being found naked with three young boys by her boyfriend and four-year-old son.

Anne Doubler, 30, of Sioux Falls, faces more than a dozen counts after she was discovered with a trio of boys between the ages of seven and 10-years-old, and police believe there are at least three more victims.

‘It’s really unusual to have multiple victims, especially in one instance,’ a police spokesperson told KELO. ‘Especially, we had three and believe there's up to six and there could be more as well.’

Wearing prison garb: Anne Doubler shown being led to a jail cell Thursday in Sioux Falls, South Dakota - she faces life in prison if convicted on all counts related to sexual contact with as many as six young boys

The young boys are Doubler’s neighbors. A mother of one of the victims told KDLT her son came home shaking.

‘She is bad, very bad,’ the mother said. Her name is being withheld to protect the identity of her child. ‘The boys are seven and eight-years-old. I said 'what's she thinking'

Authorities said they are not sure if this was the first time Doubler was alone with the young boys, but the victim’s mother said her son had been over the accused pedophile’s house multiple times.

Investigators spoke to them and confirmed the sexual contact, the Argus-Leader reported.

‘I don't feel good. I don't like it,’ said the mother.

Doubler’s horrified young son and boyfriend found her with the children Thursday afternoon and immediately called 911, said police.

‘He walked in the apartment, and started to head up the stairs and saw her at the top of the stairs and she was completely naked,’ the police spokesperson said.

Officials are not sure how long she has been victimizing the children.

‘We're not sure, you know, if this is something if she went out and found these kids, or if she knows them.  If they'd been over to the house before,’ the spokesperson lamented.

Doubler faces life in prison if convicted on all of the charges brought against.

She faces five counts each of first-degree rape, sexual contact with a child under the age of 16 and sexual exploitation of a minor.

The disgraced mother is being held in jail on a $50,000 cash-only bond.
