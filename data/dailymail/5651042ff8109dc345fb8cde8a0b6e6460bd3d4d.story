Europe minister David Lidington has become the latest senior figure to land a blow against the High Speed 2 rail link.

The Tory MP, whose Aylesbury constituency in Buckinghamshire will be affected by the line, joined the chorus of opposition to HS2 – though as a minister he is duty bound to back the scheme.

He raised fears over the spiralling cost – now at £42.6billion – and noise of the trains.

In a letter to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Mr Lidington came close to calling for the project to be scrapped after its budget soared by £10 billion.

He wrote that constituents had told him this rise ‘gives them no confidence that the final figure will [not] be significantly higher and in the current economic climate that cannot be justified’.

Voters believed HS2 should be cancelled and the money spent on other infrastructure projects, he added. Mr Lidington also cast doubt on the level of noise those living along the HS2 line would have to endure.

In a letter to Alison Munro, HS2’s chief executive, he said the study measuring average noise levels had included the period between midnight and 5am, when no trains run.

This had led to ‘very serious underestimates of what my constituents are likely to experience between 11pm and midnight and 5am and 7am’, he said.

Mr Lidington has been criticised by some constituents for not backing a rebel attempt to scupper paving legislation for HS2.

But he made clear resigning was a ‘nuclear’ option.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is said to be ‘not a fan’ of the project and former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan has labelled the scheme a ‘boys’ toy’.

The Government insists HS2 will boost the economy in the North and that scrapping it would cost close to 100,000 jobs.

The first stage, between London and Birmingham, will start in 2017 and finish in 2026. The second stage, to Manchester and Leeds, should be completed by 2033.
