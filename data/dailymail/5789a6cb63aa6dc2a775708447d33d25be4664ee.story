Arsene Wenger has revealed his deadline-day preference had been to sign Danny Welbeck on loan rather than a permanent deal.

Gary Neville admitted on Wednesday that he was stunned by Welbeck’s £16million sale from Manchester United to Arsenal.

But Wenger confirmed his initial priority was to secure a season-long loan with an agreement to buy next summer. That position is understood to have shifted when United insisted on a permanent transfer, with Tottenham also in discussions to sign the England striker.

When asked if a loan move had been his primary intention, Wenger said: ‘With an option to buy, yes.’

Welbeck followed his surprise move with two goals in England’s Euro 2016 qualifying win over Switzerland. Having spent his time at Old Trafford fluctuating between his preferred central role and positions put wide, Welbeck is now set to be played through the middle at Arsenal.

Wenger said: ‘He arrived on Wednesday and he’s happy and confident of course because he scored two goals for England in a very important game and that can only boost his confidence.

'Welbeck is young, strong and a great finisher. He can improve here.

‘When you analyse his game you think he has the qualities to play through the middle. At Manchester United, where you had many big stars, and he is a player who is very versatile, he had to make room sometimes for players to play through the middle.

'But if you analyse in an objective way his qualities, I think he has the perfect style to play through the middle.’

Wenger added: ‘He has been questioned about that (his finishing), but the second goal (for England) gives you a good answer.’

Wenger has drawn criticism in some quarters for being in Rome on deadline day, but he said: ‘If I had not travelled that day, Welbeck would not be here. I'll explain that a bit later but the coincidence made that because I was on my way.

‘If I stayed at home, Welbeck would not be here today. I will tell you that story one day but that's the truth. We are in 2014 and you can always be in touch with everybody even when you travel. The advantage of that day was I had to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning and I was available the whole day.’

When asked if Sir Alex Ferguson would have sanctioned such a deal, Wenger joked: ‘You should ask him. I met him by coincidence on Tuesday and Wednesday and I would like to keep that conversation to myself!’

Wenger added: ‘We sold Robin van Persie to Manchester United so that's a reciprocity that happened there.

'When they bought (Radamel) Falcao they had to let somebody go and I was not aware at the start when I heard that he (Welbeck) could be available. It was quick because it was on the last day of the transfer window and I had no hesitation to do it.’

Arsenal expect to have Aaron Ramsey fit to face Manchester City on Saturday despite injuring his ankle for Wales against Andorra. 

Wenger said: ‘The first news is not bad. He will be assessed today (Thursday), he has a little chance to be available for Saturday. He had an ankle sprain, it's a minor one that's for sure. Will it be enough to be available for Saturday? We'll know today.

‘Mikkel Arteta and Kieran Gibbs are back in the squad and in normal training. Mesut Ozil had a knock and didn't play for Germany because he had a sprained ankle. He will be available as well.’
