A Cornell study has discovered an uncomfortable truth about children's cereal and it's not their sky-high sugar content: it's the hypnotic eyes of their cartoon mascots.

While the people on adult cereals look straight ahead, the researchers noticed that cartoon tigers, frogs, Cap'ns and the like tend to stare downward.

That allows them to gaze right into the eyes of their intended consumer, your kids--a finding that makes sense since they also discovered that eye contact increase brand trust by 16 percent.

Here's looking at you! Cornell researchers have discovered that kids' cereal cartoon characters stare down at children at an average angle of 9.67 degrees

Cornell Food and Brand Lab Researchers Aner Tal and Brian Wansink evaluated 85 different characters at 10 grocery stores in New York and Connecticut for their project dubbed Cereal Box Psychology.

Grocers have long been known to place the kids stuff on lower shelves. But even those shelves can be above many kids' heads.

To make up for that, the researchers found that characters like Cap'n Crunch, Tony the Tiger, Luck the Leprechaun and company look downward at an average angle of 9.67 degrees.

Meanwhile, cereal for adults--Which is placed an average of 48 inches off the ground versus the children's 23 inches--tends to feature people looking straight ahead.

'Why is Cap'n Crunch looking down at my child?': The Cereal Box Psychology study came from the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab and looked at 85 characters on cereal boxes in 10 stores in New York and Connecticut

Friends: Meanwhile, the study found that people on adult cereal boxes tend to stare directly ahead, presumably into the eyes of their intended consumers, since the adult cereals are placed higher up

Coming back for more: The researchers also found that eye contact from characters increases 'brand trust' by 16 percent

The reason for those googly eyes is more than simply aesthetic.

The researchers showed one version of the Trix rabbit that made eye contact and one that did not to to 63 college students.

They found 'that brand trust was 16 percent higher and the feeling of connection to the brand was 10 percent higher when the rabbit made eye contact.'

'If you are a cereal company looking to market healthy cereals to kids, use spokes-characters that make eye contact with children to create brand loyalty,"' Wansink said.

And what of sugar conscious parents who can't bear the thought of their children being hypnotized into eating these tempting products?

'If you are a parent who does not want your kids to go "cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs,"' he said, 'avoid taking them down the cereal aisle.'
