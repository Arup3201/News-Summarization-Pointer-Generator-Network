When Orange refused to cancel his dead son’s phone contract, Peter Fitchett was incensed.

So he posted his exchange with its ‘heartless’ customer service team on Facebook – and shamed the firm into an apology.

Ben Fitchett, 14, had his BlackBerry with him when he fell to his death from a motorway bridge last month.

Peter Fitchett, seen with son Ben, branded Orange a heartless money-grabbing profiteering company

But when his father asked Orange to 
cancel the monthly bills, it refused and said he would need to pay off 
the remainder of the contract – even suggesting he sold Ben’s phone to 
recoup some of the cost.

The
50-year-old teacher was so furious that he posted the exchange on 
Facebook under the heading: ‘Think maybe I’ve been too polite. Please 
feel free to repost/share.’

Thousands
passed on the email conversation – and Orange caved in within hours, 
cancelling the contract and issuing Mr Fitchett a full apology.

Ben,
a hard-working student and talented musician, had just returned from an
adventure holiday in Switzerland when he fell from a bridge over the 
M62 near his home in Rochdale on August 19.

Police have said there are 
no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death, and the matter has 
been passed to the coroner.

Ben Fitchett's father Peter was disgusted by the insensitive reaction of Orange, who refused to cancel his son's contract

Mr
Fitchett later contacted his local Orange shop asking for Ben’s phone 
contract to be cancelled, but it refused as it had been taken out in 
Peter’s name.

In an email to
the network’s customer services team he complained: ‘My son’s sudden 
death has been traumatic enough without this experience. It simply is 
not good enough.’

He received an astonishing reply two days later from an employee who gave his name only as Joe.

He
informed Mr Fitchett: ‘Unfortunately, as the contract will be under 
your name and you are still able to pay for the agreement, it cannot be 
cancelled. We really do appreciate the situation you are in and the very
emotional time you must be going through, but we can only offer 
alternatives to your situation.’

He
suggested ‘buying out’ of the agreement, which would have cost over 
£300 for a 12-month contract based on Orange’s basic BlackBerry package.
The email continued: ‘Whilst we can understand you may wish to keep 
your son’s phone, you could sell the handset, to offset the fee.’

Mr
Fitchett explained that police had not yet returned Ben’s handset, 
adding: ‘Maybe it is in good condition after such a fall, although I 
genuinely doubt it. Would you like to make me an offer?’

He
also pointed out that Orange’s shop staff had advised that the contract
be taken out in his name in the first place, due to Ben’s young age.

He
suggested cuttingly: ‘Maybe you do this [so] in the eventuality of 
children dying it won’t affect your profits.’

Ben was a hard working student, who enjoyed being a member of the local Explorer Scouts and a volunteer at the Beaver Scouts

Ben's father encountered trouble with Orange just days after his son's funeral when he went to a phone shop to cancel the teenager's contract

Ben Fitchett died after he was seen falling from a bridge on the M62 motorway eastbound near to junction 20

Mr Fitchett said 
yesterday: ‘The situation has been resolved but this is still a very, 
very traumatic time for us.’

A
spokesman for Orange – now part of the EE network – said it had 
policies for cancelling deceased users’ contracts and was investigating 
why these hadn’t been followed.

She
added: ‘We have been in contact with Mr Fitchett to offer our sincerest
apologies for any distress caused and can confirm that we have fully 
resolved this matter with him.’

Mr Fitchett posted the emails to and from customers services on Facebook. Here are some extracts from the exchange:

My 14-year-old son has recently died, and we buried him this week...

When we got his BlackBerry last year, we were advised to add him onto my account as he was a minor ... but upon trying to cancel the shop is now telling me it’s not possible and I am liable for the full term of the contract as it’s in my name!!

We have been passed from pillar to post on the phone. It simply is not good enough, and I await a fairly quick reply please.

Thank you, Peter Fitchett

We are extremely sorry to hear about your recent loss. Unfortunately, as the contract will be under your name and you are still able to pay for the agreement, it cannot be cancelled... There is always the buying-out of the agreement, and whilst we can understand you may wish to keep your son’s phone, you could sell the handset to offset the fee.

Kindest regards, Joe

Yes, the contract is under my name, as advised by Orange. Maybe you do this [so] in the eventuality of children dying it won’t affect your profits.

I’m sure my 14 year old son wasn’t really thinking about the repercussions – we would have to deal with such a heartless, money- grabbing, profiteering company – as he threw himself off a motorway bridge to commit suicide...

Now, selling the handset to offset the fee. Maybe it is in good condition after such a fall, although I genuinely doubt it. Would you like to make me an offer?

I suggest that you ask a SENIOR manager to contact me. I would love to hear their side of the story.

I await your immediate response.

P.S. Do I get a customer satisfaction survey to fill in, please??
