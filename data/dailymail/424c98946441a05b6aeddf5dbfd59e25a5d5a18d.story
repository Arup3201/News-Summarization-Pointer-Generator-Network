Universities were yesterday accused of failing to combat a widespread ‘lads’ culture’ which has seen unwanted sexual advances and jokes about rape become commonplace.

Student leaders warned that harassment was ‘rife’ on campus after a survey found that more than a third of female students have been groped or touched inappropriately and almost two thirds said they had heard jokes about rape or sexual assault.

One university was forced to cancel a ‘safer sex ball’ after students were handed free condoms on arrival and footage emerged of two revellers having sex at the party.

Universities have been accused of ignoring a 'laddish' culture of sexual harassment as a survey has revealed that a third of female students have suffered 'unwelcome advances' on nights out (picture posed by models)

Another was left embarrassed over a 
student night promotional T-shirt featuring the phrase ‘I was raping a 
woman last night and she cried’, while reports have emerged of student 
publications inviting readers to send in pictures of ‘top student totty’
 and running ‘best bum’ competitions.

The National Union of Students 
accused universities of failing to do enough to combat the problem and 
adopting a ‘not on my campus’ attitude.

NUS president Toni Pearce said: 
‘Harassment is rife on campus but we still keep hearing from 
universities that there is no fear, no intimidation, no problem – well 
this new research says otherwise. Now I say to universities everywhere –
 the passing the buck approach of “not on my campus” is completely 
unacceptable.

Students unions and universities must work together to 
create campuses that are welcoming, safe and supportive to all.’

The survey of 2,156 students shows 
that 37 per cent of women and 12 per cent of men have been subjected to 
inappropriate groping or touching. Almost two thirds said they had heard
 jokes about rape or sexual assault being made around the campus.

The survey also revealed a lack of 
awareness of procedures in place at universities designed to tackle 
inappropriate behaviour, with 60 per cent saying they were unaware of 
any codes of conduct written by their university or their students’ 
union. Laura Bates, from the Everyday Sexism campaign, said: ‘Students 
are experiencing sexism, sexual harassment and assault within the 
university environment.

‘It is worth mentioning that one 
category of such experiences “inappropriate touching and groping” 
actually constitutes sexual assault under UK law.

‘Though many students would not label it as such, this normalisation and lack of awareness is a major part of the problem.’

However Nicola Dandridge, chief 
executive of Universities UK, said: ‘Where students require support, 
there are a variety of services on hand to listen to students.

‘These include welfare officers, advice centres and university counselling services.’

She added: ‘If alleged criminal 
behaviour is involved, all universities would support any students 
reporting such incidents to the police. It is important to remember that
 this is an issue for society generally, not just one confined to 
university students.’

 - Website UniLad published an article which was called ‘Sexual Mathematics’ in 2012. The piece stated: ‘Think about this mathematical statistic: 85 per cent of rape cases go unreported. That seems to be fairly good odds.’

- Exeter University Students’ Guild’s ‘Safer Sex Ball’ caused controversy when two students were filmed having sex near the bar. In 2011, its leaflets had a ‘joke’ about how many calories a man could burn by forcibly undressing a girl.

- A poster for a club night at Cardiff Metropolitan University showed a T-shirt with the words: ‘I was raping a woman last night and she cried.’

- Events company Tequila UK ran a night called ‘Freshers’ Violation’ in Leeds last year. The promotional film featured men joking about rape. 

- A Durham college’s rugby club social saw members play a drinking game where they had to complete the phrase: ‘It’s not rape if…’
