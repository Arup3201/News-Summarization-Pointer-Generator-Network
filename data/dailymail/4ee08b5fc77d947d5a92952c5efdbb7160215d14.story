After an 12-year long legal battle, the grieving parents of 15-year-old Scots college student Nathan Chaina have been ordered to pay $8.3 million of the school's legal fees.

The Chaina family were seeking compensation for the death of their son at a school camp in 1999, but instead are finding themselves $7,770,869 out of pocket.

In May this year, the eastern Sydney school's operator, the Presbyterian Church Property Trust, was ordered to pay the family $492,373 - a fraction of the $100 million the family were seeking.

Jean-Pierre Chaina, Nathan Chaina's brother says the family are devastated by the court's latest rulings.

'This is an absolute tragedy, an abuse of process and denial of justice,' Mr Chaina told Daily Mail Australia.

On October 23, 1999, Nathan Chaina drowned after falling into a river during a school camp at The Scots College's Glengarry campus in the Kangaroo Valley.

Nathan's younger brother, Matthew witnessed the accident.

In May this year, Justice David Davies awarded the Chainas $429,373 saying they were able to return to work a few years after the tragic incident.

On Thursday, Justice Davies said that, with interest, they were entitled to $529,131 but must pay 70 per cent of Scots' total legal costs since June 2003, when the couple were first offered a settlement of $350,000 each.

Justice Davies says it is unreasonable for the couple to continually reject offers and have been responsible for the length and cost of the case.

In 2002, Nathan's parents, George and Rita Chaina claimed damages for nervous shock and for the effect of their son's death on their cleaning product companies.

They also claim their companies, Proton Technology Pty Ltd and Deluxe Chemicals Pty Ltd, lost millions of dollars because of the trauma they had experienced after their son's death.

During his ruling in May, Justice Davies also ruled that the mental harm the pair had gone through had disintegrated by 2011.

He said the couple's failure to engage in the relaunch of their companies' products was not the school's fault.

Scots College student Nathan Chaina fell into a flooded river at Kangaroo Valley and drowned on October 23, 1999, when he was 15 years old.

Justice Davies went on to say Mr Chaina was not a 'witness of truth' and had not given consistent replies during evidence.

'(Mr Chaina) had a fixed and almost delusional view about himself, his own abilities and expertise and about the success and reputation of his companies, in the face of strong evidence to the contrary,' he said.

'He said whatever he believed would help him to win this case and obtain very substantial damages.

'This was at least partly motivated by his desire for vengeance.'

The state's Deputy Coroner Jan Stevenson previously ruled The Scots College was to blame for the tragedy.

'[Nathan's] death is primarily attributable to the school overlooking ordinary aspects of human nature together with a lack of risk management and safety procedures,' Ms Stevenson said in 2001.

The teenager was reported missing for about 15 hours before his body was found in Yurrunga Creek in Kangaroo Valley. It was 24 hours after he fell into the water when crossing the creek.

Nathan was separated from the excursion group because of heavy flooding.

The Scots College is an elite all-boys private school in Sydney's eastern suburbs.

The Chaina family spent $20 million on legal fees last year alone.
