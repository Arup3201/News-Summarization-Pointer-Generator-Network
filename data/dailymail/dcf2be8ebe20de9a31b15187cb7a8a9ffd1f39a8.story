The prospect of a Monaco-style F1 Grand Prix on the streets of London has moved a step closer after the coalition announced new powers for Town Halls to stage motor races.

Councils will be able to sign off major motor races on public roads for the first time, instead of needing to get specific approval from Parliament.

Unveiling the move as he opened Williams' new F1 engineering facility in Oxfordshire, David Cameron said it would mean 'more races, more events, more money coming into our country'.

He added: 'We're going to change the rules so that local councils are able to make the decision so you don't have to have a private member's Bill through Parliament, which we think will be great news for British motor sport.'

'More races, more events, more money coming into our country and more success for this extraordinary industry.'

The Prime Minister said F1 was 'an amazing success story, eight of the 11 teams based here in the United Kingdom, 41,000 people working in the industry in the Oxford area alone, working for about 4,300 companies'.

'It really is something we should celebrate. It seems to me it's an industry that is in good heart and good spirit with incredible investment, permanent improvement, taking place.'

The idea of a Monaco-style Grand Prix on the streets of London has been mooted for some time - with F1 team sponsor Santander even producing a video of what it might look like. Boris Johnson has signalled he is ready to support a project.

The Government's announcement follows a consultation earlier this year, and the change is expected to be added to the Deregulation Bill in the autumn. It could be in force before the general election next year.

The Prime Minister's spokesman said local authorities would be obliged to consult local people and ensure all necessary safety precautions were in place.

While it will significantly open up the opportunities for hill climbs, motorbike races, and rallies across rural Britain, the biggest impact could be in paving the way for a Formula One race which passes Buckingham Palace and Big Ben.

Billionaire race boss Bernie Ecclestone believes a London Grand Prix could become the most iconic race in the motorsport calendar - supplanting Monaco as the jewel in the F1 crown

The race is a long-held ambition of Bernie Ecclestone, the 83-year-old motorsport supremo, and Jenson Button, the driver.

Mr Ecclestone has even previously said he would be prepared to foot the bill race, given it could even overtake Monte Carlo as the jewel in Formula One’s crown.

Button, who fronted a major campaign for the race with his then team-mate Lewis Hamilton in 2012, said earlier this year: 'The thought of a race through the capital’s streets was only a dream when they initiated the project, but changes to the law bring the idea a step closer to reality.'

The measure also clears the way for the hosting of Formula E, the all-electric car championship, in Britain, with a race planned for next summer in Battersea Park.
