Massive fan: Aged only six, Jack Pinto - a Sandy Hook victim - was a massive Giants fan

He was only six years old, but Jack Pinto was already a huge New York Giants fan. 

And in particular, he loved Victor Cruz, the 26-year-old receiver who celebrates every touchdown with a little salsa dance.

So when Pinto was tragically gunned down during the Sandy Hook massacre on Friday, his idol needed to mark the moment.

When his team took on the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, Cruz's boots were inscribed with the words 'Jack Pinto, My Hero', 'R.I.P. Jack Pinto' and  'This one is for you'.

His tribute came after describing how humbling it was to find out how much of an impact he had on Pinto's short life.

In fact, Pinto's parents are considering burying Jack in a Cruz No. 80 football shirt, as they prepare to bury him next Monday.

Cruz said he plans to give the gloves he wore during the game to the boy's family, and spend some time with them.

He said: 'There's
 no words that can describe the type of feeling that you get when a kid 
idolizes you so much that unfortunately they want to put him in the 
casket with your jersey on.

'I can't even explain it.'

Respect: Cruz, pictured earlier this year, was moved to hear how big a fan Jack Pinto was, and paid tribute to him on the pitch

Cruz added: 'I also spoke to an older brother and
 he was distraught as well. I told him to stay strong and I was going to
 do whatever I can to honor him.

'He was fighting tears and could barely speak to me.'

Cruz started the tributes before the match, tweeting: 'Today's game is for you, Jack.'

Afterwards he said: 'It was very humbling to hear how big of a fan he was and how they were thinking about putting my jersey on him for the services.

'It was an emotional time. It really shows you what type of effect that athletes have on kids. Not just seeing you on TV. They want to be you. They idolize you. They wear your jersey everywhere.

'It really showed me how real it is to be a role model. It was definitely humbling for sure.'

“When a family is facing that much tragedy,” Cruz added, “you want to be someone that inspires them and can put a smile on their face in a time where it’s tough to do that.”

Jack's funeral is scheduled for 1 p.m.
 on Monday at the Honan Funeral Home in Newtown, followed by burial at 
the Newtown Village Cemetery.

NFL fans across the nation paid respect to the victims with with periods of silence and reflection.

Some teams darkened their scoreboards and lowered their flags to half-staff, while others wore helmet decals or black ribbons.

The faces of the innocent victims 
began to circulate as the families grapple with the horror that unfolded
 on Friday, when gunman Adam Lanza killed 26 in a shooting rampage at 
the school.

The first parent of a child victim spoke out in an emotional press conference on Saturday.

Robbie Parker, the father of Emilie 
Parker, 6, addressed the press on Saturday, holding back tears as he 
remembered the precious six-year-old, the oldest of his three daughters.

The grieving father remembered the beautiful gifts and talents endowed to the little girl by her heavenly father.

In a remarkable act, Mr Parker 
expressed his condolences to the family of the gunman and thanked 
friends and strangers for their support and love.
