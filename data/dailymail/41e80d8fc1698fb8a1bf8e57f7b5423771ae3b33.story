The mother of a 22-year-old jailed for a horrific hammer attack on his abusive father has begged for him to be released from prison after he saved her from another beating.

Tracey Wilson, 43, said 'it doesn't feel like justice,' after her son Ben Wilson was jailed for six years for battering his father with a lump hammer.

The attack left her 46-year-old husband, Craig   - who had a long history of assaulting her - with brain damage and holes in his head.

 Mrs Wilson said she was 'so proud' of her son for defending her, the Daily Mirror reported.  

'What he did was only to help me and it is terrible he is now in jail,' she told the newspaper

'To see him getting a long sentence was devastating.' 

Wilson was jailed for six years Teesside Crown Court after admitting wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but the sentence has sparked outrage. 

Thousands of people have signed a petition calling for Benjamin Wilson to be freed.

The 'Free Ben Wilson' e-petition has more than 40,000 signatures from around the world, and a 'Help Free Ben Wilson' Facebook page has more than 14,000 likes.

The petition, which was set up by Marie Taylor, who said: 'Ben got 6 years for protecting his mother and himself from an abusive man under the influence of alcohol. 

'Ben has recently become a father and is not going to be able to bring his child up and give him a better life than what he was brought up in.

'Save this boy from more years of [torture] he has suffered enough and his family.'

The 22-year-old, of Billingham, County Durham, who is a new father himself, had grown up in 'an atmosphere of violence, fear and intimidation' and was subjected to violence himself.

Wilson's father was described in court as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character and a 'violent nasty drunk', who once served a two-year sentence for assaulting his wife.

During that assault on New Year's Eve 2007, the 46-year-old put both hands around his wife's neck and pressed so hard her eyes bled and she passed out.

Anita Homer added: 'This is appalling!!! We have a wonky, unfair and non standardised jurisdiction. 

'There are so many cases where a person has intentionally killed someone and only received very short sentences.

'This lad's behaviour was not intentional. He only wanted to protect his mom.'
