A Royal Air Force Typhoon was today scrambled after two Russian surveillance planes flew close to British airspace.

The aircraft, believed to be Tupolev 95s, were spotted off the coast of north-east Scotland - but turned away when the British jet fighter took off from Leuchars airbase, near St Andrews in Fife.

Incidents
 of foreign planes flying close to UK airspace are surprisingly common -
 with eight similar occurrences reported last year, according to the Ministry of Defence.

Defence experts say Russia uses such 
surveillance flights to remind the world of its military might and to 
probe other countries' air defence systems.

The incident comes as international tensions heighten over the Ukraine situation, after last month's annexation of Crimea by Russia.

An MoD spokesman said: 'Typhoon quick reaction alert aircraft were launched today from RAF Leuchars to determine the identity of unknown aircraft that approached the Nato air policing area north of Scotland and could not be identified by other means.

'The aircraft were subsequently 
identified as Russian military aircraft. The Russian military aircraft remained in international airspace at all times as they are perfectly entitled to do so.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said tonight: 'Recent events have increased awareness of Russian military activity.

'But we have always routinely intercepted, identified and escorted Russian air and naval assets that transit international airspace and waters within the UK's area of interest.

'The Royal Navy and Royal Air Force will remain alert and ready to intercept any non-NATO forces in the area.'
