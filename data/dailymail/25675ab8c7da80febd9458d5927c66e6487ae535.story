There is disquiet among the FIFA executive about president Sepp Blatter's unilateral move to spend an alleged £16million funding a film about world football's ruling body.

Several members of FIFA’s decision-making committee were unaware that United Passions, charting the history of FIFA and launched at the Cannes Film Festival this week, had been made, let alone that Blatter had spent so much of the organisation’s money on the project.

Following Sports Agenda revealing Blatter’s massive investment on what is expected to be a huge box office flop, FIFA powerbrokers have a number of questions for their leader.

Trouble: FIFA president Sepp Blatter (second from left) faces questions from members after spending £16million on a film project about the organisation

Namely, why doesn’t FIFA’s funding of the film appear in the latest financial accounts? What allocated budget is the money coming from? And how can the spending be justified when FIFA are cutting costs knowing that the problematic Brazil World Cup is going to be a lot more expensive than first envisaged?

Certainly the film issue is likely to impact on Blatter at the FIFA congress in Sao Paulo in three weeks, when he is due to announce his candidature for a fifth term as president.

The busy Clare Balding is to replace John Inverdale as presenter of Radio 5 Live’s Wimbledon coverage, with Sports Agenda having written last year that Inverdale would not host the programme following his crass ‘never a looker’ comment about women’s champion Marion Bartoli.

The BBC would not comment on whether Inverdale, who will present the daily TV highlights on BBC2, was being punished for his gaffe.

Holland might have switched their World Cup hotel and training base if they had known in advance that manager Louis van Gaal would be taking over at Manchester United.

The Caesar Park hotel on Rio’s Ipanema beach and Flamengo’s complex where Holland will train are open to the public, giving Van Gaal little respite from what will be a media frenzy.

By comparison, England’s Royal Tulip Hotel, further out of Rio, and their Urca military base training facility look havens of tranquillity.

ITV Sport will not show commercials during the drinks breaks which will occur during a number of World Cup matches.

FIFA gave broadcasters the option of advertising during the cooling periods, which will be decided on a match-by-match basis by the venue medical officer if the temperature exceeds 32°C.

But ITV, despite the potential advertising riches, wanted to keep their broadcasts focused on the game, which was felt to be in the best interests of viewers.

Roo's generation game

The Rooney clan are not only heading to Brazil for the World Cup but are showing support to Wayne during England training in Portugal’s Vale do Lobo this week.

Rooney’s father-in-law Tony and livewire four-year-old son Kai watched Wednesday’s session from the middle of the media pack before going back to their holiday base to celebrate the first birthday of Kai’s brother Klay.

So relaxed is manager Roy Hodgson in this first week of the World Cup adventure that he invited a Vale Do Lobo resident, who he had met while out for a stroll, to watch training, too.

The weather in the Algarve this week is very similar to that in Staffordshire, highlighting the bizarre situation of England preparing for the World Cup away from St George’s Park, the £100million training centre where Roy Hodgson’s squad are spending less than three full days during the build-up to Brazil.

Hodgson defends such sparse use of the national facility by saying it is better bonding as a squad when you go abroad and that St George's Park wasn’t built solely for senior team use.

Ashley Cole and Aaron Lennon being left out of the World Cup squad means England will go into a major tournament with every member of the party prepared to talk to the media. Things will have gone remarkably well if the same co-operation is in place come July. 

Meanwhile, Southampton’s £30m-rated Luke Shaw, a target for Manchester United, is not expected to know where he will play next season until after the World Cup, adding to the pressure on the 18-year-old left back in Brazil.

On the move? England's Luke Shaw will go to the World Cup with his future at Southampton undecided
