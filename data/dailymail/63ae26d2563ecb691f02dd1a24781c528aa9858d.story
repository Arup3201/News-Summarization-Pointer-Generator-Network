You may not have heard of Palermo striker Paulo Dybala until recently but the young Argentine is drawing plenty of attention this season.

Dubbed the 'new Sergio Aguero', the young Argentine is currently being watched by Manchester United and has been tipped for superstardom by former Red Devils coach Phil Neville.

Rated at £30million, the 21-year-old can play on the right wing or as a striker and has impressed during this, his breakthrough season in Serie A, scoring eleven goals.

Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the latest exciting talent from South America about to take Europe by storm.

Early Years

Paulo Dybala began his career with hometown club Instituto in Argentina's second division.

Nicknamed the Jewel, Dybala played 38 consecutive games during his debut season for the club and managed 17 goals. 

Beating Mario Kempes' record as Instituto's youngest-ever goalscorer at the age of 17,  Dybala had truly announced his arrival with nearly a goal every two matches. Not a bad ratio for a teenager during his first-ever campaign.

Clubs across Europe, including Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, were said to have started to take notice.

Palermo

Dybala made the move to Europe in April 2012, signing for Italian side Palermo for a fee of £9million.

Club president Maurizio Zamparini was quick to put the youngster on a pedestal and proclaimed: 'We have got Paulo Dybala.. the new Sergio Aguero'. No pressure then.

However, after managing just three goals in his debut season as Palermo were relegated, Dybala only registered a further five strikes as the Eagles won promotion at the first time of asking.

Back in the Italian top-flight this season, Dybala has flourished alongside compatriot Franco Vazquez and has already scored eleven goals this term including strikes against AC Milan and Roma.

'This year he has exploded, but I already knew that he was very good,' said Zamparini. 

'Dybala is worth over €40m but I won't sell him until June. Many foreign clubs asked after him, including Manchester United.

'I told the English side that he is not for sale right now, but we can talk about it again in six months. In my view, he is the best striker in Europe at the moment.' 

High praise indeed.

Playing style 

Boasting exquisite close control with a quick turn of pace, the Argentine loves to run at defenders.

Never the tallest player on the pitch, Dybala stands at 5ft10 but has shown he can compete; showing his strength against opponents this term in order to work his way into goalscoring positions.

Predominantly left-footed, the attacker, who doesn't turn 22 until November, is direct and an exceptional finisher capable of forcing his way goalwards with a host of tricks and skills.

Nutmegs, jinking runs and even keepy-uppies whilst on the move, Dybala loves to cut inside when deployed on the right wing.

Tipped for superstardom

Touted as the next Aguero by his current club president, Dybala is certainly a talent. However, the forward has also received praise from outside the Stadio Renzo Barbera. 

Speaking to Sportsmail's Matt Lawton earlier this year, former Manchester United player and coach Phil Neville said shortly after a trip to watch Palermo take on Genoa: 'There’s a player at Palermo who is going to be a superstar, by the way. Paulo Dybala. Remember that name.' 

Having played with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs and David Beckham, Neville knows a supreme talent when he sees one.

International scene  

Born in Argentina, Dybala is yet to earn an international cap but is eligible to play for Poland, through his grandfather, as well as Italy.

However, the young frontman has already spoken of his desire to play for the country of his birth and cites former Argentina playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme as one of his heroes.

Also an admirer of Ronaldinho, Dybala claims he likes to play for the fun of football. 

With the likes of Aguero, Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Gonzalo Higuain to choose from up front, Dybala will have proven his credentials should he finally earn a call up from the national side.
