More than 1,000 years ago this pre-Inca baby was laid to rest  on a barren Peruvian hillside.

It was among dozens of well-preserved mummified skeletons found by archaeologists on the outskirts of the capital city of Lima.

The discovery was made by experts who were hired by the Government to search the hillside for any remains prior to the building of a new road.  

This pre-Inca baby was found on a barren Peruvian hillside by archaeologist combing the site before a new road is constructed

The newfound site is on the northwestern edge the largest Inca cemetery ever excavated, Puruchuco-Huaquerones. 

In the last 60 years researchers have examined just 10 per cent of the historic site.

So far they have uncovered 2,000 mummies, ceramics and hundreds of pieces of textile, silver, copper and gold.

Three days into the project the archaeologist came across the cemetery, according to National Geographic News. 

'By now we have over 40 [mummy bundles] and the number increases every day.' Guillermo Cock, a Lima-based archaeologist, reportedly told the website.

'Given the proximity to the city and the tradition of looting in the area, we are really surprised that this is mostly undisturbed, mostly intact, mostly unlooted.

'Only a few bundles have suffered damage by human action.'

In total the team located around 26 tombs, containing both children and adults.
