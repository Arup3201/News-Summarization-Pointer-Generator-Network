The British host of a US TV show who once ran a UK dance school which was likened to a religious cult has been shot dead by his son-in-law in an attempted 'murder-suicide'.

Scott Rogers, 52, is understood to have been killed by Mathew Hodgkinson, who was also his former lover, in a murder-suicide attempt at his Louisiana home, according to local police.

Mr Hodgkinson, 36, who was also British, was married to Mr Rogers' daughter Kimmy, and it has been suggested that all three lived in the home where Mr Rogers was shot.

Louisiana TV personality Scott Rogers, 52, was shot and killed at his Baton Rouge home on Wednesday by his son-in-law - Matthew Hodgkinson - who was also believed to be his former lover

Originally from Suffolk, Rogers was well-known in Baton Rouge as the host of the feel-good Around Town show, which airs on WAFB on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

A suspected suicide note believed to be written by Hodgkinson was found in Rogers’ home.

‘They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too,’ read the note.

Police said Hodgkinson is currently in a coma in Our Lady of the Lake Hospital, Baton Rouge after surviving the alleged murder-suicide attempt. 

Rogers, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk in 1983. He was then known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK.

The school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending children to the school.

On Thursday two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that Scott Rogers, who had been known as Richard Scott-Rogers, had sexually abused them as young boys in the UK.

Scott Rogers, who was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds in 1983. 

But the school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council in 1995, and they warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children there.

According to the Bury Free Press, Rogers was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993.

Parents also told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags.'

In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993.

In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' .

It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.'

But at the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts.' 

Rogers left the UK and moved to the U.S. in the mid-90s. 

One of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at his dance academy, claimed to have been intimately involved with Rogers from the age of 13. He said that the encounters 'increased in frequency' until he was 18. The other alleged victim described him as a 'monster'.

At the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts. Some of our pupils have moved on to appear in the West End theatre and on television.

'People are still coming here for classes from all over Suffolk. We are not involved in any cult activities and to say we are is ridiculous.' 

Rogers moved to the U.S. in the mid-90s.

Iberville Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi, investigating the shooting, said Rogers' home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several weeks.

He said: 'It looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide. Scott was shot in his bed, under the covers, tucked neatly in.

'It looks like Mathew put the gun to his own head... he was seriously wounded but still alive. He's still in a critical condition in an induced coma. It's been topsy-turvy at this residence.

'We responded to a couple of calls. It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it culminated in this.'

Rogers was also under investigation for fraud and the state took custody of two children - his 10-year-old adopted son and a two-year-old boy he was in the process of adopting - earlier this month, according to The Advocate.

Mr Stassi also told the Times-Picayune that the marriage between Hodgkinson, who was also Rogers’ former dance student, and Kimberly Ann Scott-Rogers was a sham to keep UK-born Hodgkinson in the country.

She was reportedly testifying before a federal grand jury when her father was killed.
