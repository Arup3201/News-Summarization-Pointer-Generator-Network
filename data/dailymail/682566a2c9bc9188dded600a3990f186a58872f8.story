Angelina Jolie has shown off her wedding ring for the first time since the news of her marriage to Brad Pitt.

The Oscar-winning actress, 39, was spotted on location in Malta with daughters Vivienne and Shiloh, where she is about to begin shooting By The Sea, the second film to star herself and Pitt, 50.

Stepping onto a boat at the Mgarr Ix-Xini Bay, Angelina's gold band - believed to have been designed by the couple's good friend Robert Procop who was also behind her engagement ring - flashed in the sun against her all simple black outfit.

Back to work: The actress and director is on location ahead of production on By The Sea

Angelina covered her head with a black hat and wore sunglasses to protect her eyes from the sun, as she joined a male crew ready to check out the locations to be used for the film.

While details of the plotline are being kept under wraps, The Hollywood Reporter claims that the newlyweds will play husband and wife in the flick, which is set to be released sometime in 2016.

The star penned the script and will also direct  By The Sea, the third feature film to her name.

On Friday Angelina released a statement about the plight of Syrian refugees, used publicity surrounding her recent nuptials to highlight the issue.

It read: 'Three million refugees is not just another statistic. It is a searing indictment of our collective failure to end the war in Syria.'

The couple enjoyed a brief honeymoon in Nice after tying the knot in front of 22 guests, including their six children, at their chateau on Saturday.

A source told E News! that the actress walked down the aisle in a white dress which was 'very traditional, but very Angie, it was comfortable but plain white floor-length antique lace and silk'.

Brad was the first to be seen with his new wedding ring, having attended a photocall on Thursday in Dorset for his WWII epic Fury.

And a source today told MailOnline how the couple decided to marry at the stunning estate they bought in 2011 after Angelina made a promise to wed in France to her mother - and also to commemorate the 10-year anniversary of the filming of Mr & Mrs Smith, where they met and fell in love.

While the designer of Angelina's gown is still unknown, the website claims the star 'definitely wore something that once belonged to [her late mother] Marcheline Bertrand.

'It was a small locket with a photo of her mother inside it. She had a veil and Brad gasped when he lifted it because she looked so stunning.'

That's better! The group were seen boarding a small boat which transferred them to a much larger yacht for a tour of the Ta Cenc Cliffs
