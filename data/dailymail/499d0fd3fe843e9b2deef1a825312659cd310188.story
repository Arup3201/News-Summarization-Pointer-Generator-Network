A New York cabbie who told a female fare-paying passenger that she had ‘a real nice ass’ has had his licence revoked.

The comment was one of several sleazy remarks that Mirza Baig, 22, made during a journey on March 17 from La Guardia airport to the passenger’s home.

In a recent investigation he was deemed a ‘threat to the riding public’ by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which struck him off.

According to a report on the incident, Baig relentlessly pestered her with questions deemed inappropriate as he drove her to her Brooklyn home.

He asked whether she had a boyfriend and whether she was going to his house.

After the unnamed woman lied that she was with someone, Baig enquired as to whether she would be sleeping with him that night.

She told investigators that she was left feeling ‘violated’, the report states.

Baig told the passenger that they should ‘get together’ and by the time he reached the woman’s house she felt so intimidated that she gave him a 20 per cent tip to keep him calm, even though he refused to help with her luggage.

The report said: ‘He then yelled out the window, “Are you sure you don’t want to, you know, come back with me?”’

As the woman searched for the right key to open her apartment door the taxi driver, who had been staring at her from his car, said: ‘You have a real nice ass, baby.’ He then drove away.

Baig’s lawyer said that he’d been misunderstood and was genuinely trying to flirt with the passenger.

The TLC, however, said that he’d gone too far.

Spokesman Allan Fromberg said: ‘It is is unacceptable for a driver to cross the line of propriety with a passenger, and in the rare occasions when it happens, we are grateful to be alerted to it so we can take the appropriate actions, as we did in this instance.’

His conduct was deemed ‘unprofessional, crude and offensive’ by administrative law judge Tynia Richard, from the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, The New York Post reported.
