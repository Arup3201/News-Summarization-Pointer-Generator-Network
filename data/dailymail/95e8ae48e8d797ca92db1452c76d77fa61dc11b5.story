Star attraction: In the autumn, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt completed filming their romantic drama By The Sea on the nine-by-four-mile island of Gozo

Now that Christmas is over, the annual assault from the holiday companies has begun, with firms urging us to book our summer vacations. One of the destinations being advertised is Gozo, Malta’s picturesque smaller sister. But Gozo is not just good for a holiday rental – it is worth buying there too, especially because of the limelight that will shine upon it in the coming year.

In the autumn, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt completed filming their romantic drama By The Sea on the nine-by-four-mile island. It is scheduled for release in 2015. 

The couple, who married on August 23, seemed to treat filming as a mix of a belated honeymoon and work.

Much of this filming took place on one of Gozo’s favourite secluded beaches – Mgarr ix-Xini, which was closed to the public for three months while the production team took it over. 

They also filmed in the square in the village of Gharb.

‘It’s been very good for Gozo having Brad and Angelina here,’ says Marie Grech, manager of estate agent Frank Salt’s Gozo office. 

‘It has raised the island’s profile and increased the number of people visiting while they were filming. Hopefully, some of these people will return.’

Although small – the island has only 37,000 residents, known as Gozitans – Gozo has 13 villages and two seaside holiday areas. 

The capital, Victoria, has two opera houses and a magnificent citadel built on raised ground. There is no airstrip on the island so visitors arrive by ferry from Malta.

Homes there are remarkably good value. ‘Properties on Gozo are ten per cent to 20 per cent cheaper than on Malta, with some enjoying marvellous views of the Gozitan countryside and the Mediterranean blue seas,’ says John Abela of Gozo Prime (gozoprime.com). ‘It is much greener – and life is so much more laid-back – than in Malta. Gozo is also much safer.’

Jane Purvis, 61, bought a new farmhouse in 2009. Her late husband, Malcolm, discovered and fell in love with Gozo when he was sailing in the Mediterranean as a 21-year-old.

‘When we married 33 years ago, he promised me he’d take me there, although it was a while before he did,’ says Jane. ‘I loved it too and for 11 years we went there regularly, staying in the same hotel every time. 

Picturesque: Gozo has lots of fantastic restaurants, amazing food and wine, and it’s not expensive

'We decided we were going so often that it would make more sense to buy a house and nine years ago bought a “shell” in the village of Xaghra. The builder finished the house for us in under six months and after January 2005 we used it often.’

Sadly, Malcolm died earlier this year, which is why Jane is very reluctantly selling up. ‘The more you go, the more you love it,’ she says. 

‘Gozo has the most fantastic charm. It’s so tranquil, although some parts, such as Marsalforn, are pretty buzzy in the summer. 

There are lots of fantastic restaurants, amazing food and wine, and it’s not expensive.’ Her three-bedroom house, which has been built in rustic style, is fully furnished, with air-conditioning, a pool, lovely views of country and sea, and is for sale for €645,000 (£506,000) through Frank Salt.

Relatively cheap: Homes there are remarkably good value. Most property is built from local limestone. Ceilings are high and the older properties have traditional arches, wooden beams, beautifully patterned tiled floors and interior courtyards

Most property is built from local limestone. Ceilings are high and the older properties have traditional arches, wooden beams, beautifully patterned tiled floors and interior courtyards. 

You can buy a furnished two-bedroom apartment in the village of Xlendi for €105,000 (£82,000, franksalt.com.mt) or a new two-bedroom apartment in the village of Qala for €151,400 (£119,000, gozohomes.com). 

A furnished two-bedroom farmhouse with garden and terraces in Mgarr ix-Xini will cost you €215,000 (£169,000, gozoprime.com) or, at the top end of the scale, a farmhouse in Gharb with two bedrooms, a large living and dining room and a landscaped terraced, garden and pool could be yours for €1.175 million (£923,000, franksalt.com.mt). There are also many old properties, ripe for conversion.

Set to boom: Gozo is not just good for a holiday rental – it is worth buying there too, especially because of the limelight that will shine upon it in the coming year

One feature of Gozo is its 46 churches, with the largest in the oldest village, Xewkija. Its dome is the third-largest unsupported one in Europe, after St Peter’s in Rome and St Paul’s in London. 

There’s only one large sandy beach, Ramla, on the island, with the majority being small, rocky coves tucked away down long, winding paths – some with cafes, most without. All have crystal-clear sea, which is warm from May to Christmas.

‘People like Gozo because it has a healthy lifestyle, it takes only a maximum of 15 minutes to get to a beach or Victoria, and it’s easy to integrate into village community,’ says Marie. 

‘The government has been putting a lot of money into improving the roads, restoring all the old churches and citadel and enlarging the hospital, which is good for both residents and visitors.’
