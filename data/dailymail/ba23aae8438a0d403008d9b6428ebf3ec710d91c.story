Brighton have completed the signing of Chris O'Grady from Barnsley or an undisclosed fee.

The 28-year-old striker has been brought to the south coast on a three-year-deal in order to replace Leonardo Ulloa, who looks set to move to Leicester City for £7million.

O'Grady played 40 times for Barnsley last season, netting 15 times.

Ex-Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia, who manages Brighton, beat off competition from former Reds striker Nigel Clough who tried to lure O'Grady to League One Sheffield United.

Hyypia told Brighton's official club website: 'He (O'Grady) is a strong physical presence.

'Chris gives us something different to the other strikers we already have here at the club.'

O'Grady has previously represented Sheffield Wednesday, Leicester City, Rotherham United, Oldham Athletic and Rochdale among other clubs.

He is available for selection for Brighton's friendly with Crawley Town on Wednesday.
