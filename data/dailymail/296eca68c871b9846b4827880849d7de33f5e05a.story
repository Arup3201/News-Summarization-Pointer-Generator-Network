Quarantined: Kaci Kickox was put in compulsory isolation when she came back to the U.S. from Sierra Leone

A nurse put under mandatory quarantine at a U.S. airport when she came back from fighting Ebola has criticized new measures to contain the disease, saying she has been treated like a criminal.

Kaci Hickox, a nurse with Doctors Without Borders, arrived at Liberty Newark Airport in New Jersey yesterday after returning from an assignment in Sierra Leone, one of the West African nations hardest-hit by the outbreak.

But she has said that when she arrived she met a scene of chaos and suspicion, where officials left her in the dark, falsely declared she was feverish then bundled her into an emergency motorcade to hospital.

On arriving at University Hospital in Newark, Hickox tested negative for Ebola - but must remain under quarantine for the next three weeks under new rules.

It follows widespread concern about how Dr Craig Spencer, another Doctors Without Borders worker, was allowed to go free in New York for a week before it emerged that he had Ebola.

Hickox, writing for the Dallas News, said that she was held at immigration for three hours while a 'frenzy of disorganization' raged around her.

She added that suspicious officials who 'barked' at her as if she had broken the law made her so worried and flustered that inaccurate forehead scanners read her temperature too high - sparking fears she had Ebola.

She said that the moment an official recorded a temperature of 101 she was met with the 'smug' statement 'you have a fever now'.

She was then bundled into an ambulance, which stormed down the freeway to hospital surrounded by an eight-car police motorcade. She was pictured emerging at the hospital wearing a hazmat suit.

Media outlets were briefed that she had 'developed a fever' and she arrived at hospital to doctors expecting the worst. 

But when her temperature was taken properly, the oral thermometer  recorded a normal result of 98.6.

Hickox, who holds degrees from the University of Texas at Arlington and the Johns Hopkins University, said that her rough treatment makes her worry for her colleagues still in Africa trying to stop the virus outbreak which has killed some 5,000 people there.

She wrote: 'I had spent a month watching children die, alone. I had witnessed human tragedy unfold before my eyes.

'I had tried to help when much of the world has looked on and done nothing... I sat alone in the isolation tent and thought of many colleagues who will return home to America and face the same ordeal. Will they be made to feel like criminals and prisoners?'

She continued: 'The epidemic continues to ravage West Africa... We need more health care workers to help fight the epidemic in West Africa. The U.S. must treat returning health care workers with dignity and humanity.'

Hickox is the first person to fall under the new quarantine rules, which cover the states of New York and New Jersey, and were announced yesterday by New Jersey Governor Chirs Christie and his New York counterpart Andrew Cuomo.

Any person traveling from the three West African nations who had contact with infected, or possibly infected, people will be automatically quarantined for 21 days. This includes doctors.

It will be coordinated with local health departments. 

Governor Christie tweeted on Friday: 'Today, a healthcare worker arrived at Newark Airport, w/ a recent history of treating patients w/ Ebola in West Africa, but w/ no symptoms.' 

He said that the New Jersey Department of Health determined that a legal quarantine order should be issued.

He added: 'This woman, while her home residence is outside of this area, her next stop was going to be here in NY.'

However, the rules have not been met with universal support. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio sounded a note of caution over a 'chilling effect' on innocent doctors and nurses.

A spokesman for the mayor said: 'The mayor wants to work closely with our state partners, but he wants to make sure that there will not be any sort of chilling effect on medical workers who might want to go over to help.'

The New Jersey Department of Health was not available to comment.
