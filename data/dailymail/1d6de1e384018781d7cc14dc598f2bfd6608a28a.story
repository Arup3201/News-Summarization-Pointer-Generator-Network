The winless Giants aren't the only New Yorkers having a tough fall.

A report out Wednesday by a national tax watch group put New York in the cellar among states when comparing the complexity of tax codes and tax rates. The national Tax Foundation ranked New York at 50th.

New York's individual income tax ranking was 49th, ahead of only California, the group said. The Empire State ranked last in corporate taxes. Five of the top 10 worst states were in the northeast.

Though New York ranked last, the Tax Foundation said it was no worse than neighbor New Jersey. Both states had plenty of company in the northeast.

‘Though New Jersey has a better overall rank than New York, the states are in a virtual tie for last place this year,’ the report said.

‘New York has a more favorable corporate tax ranking than New Jersey, but its individual income tax suffers from such high rates and narrow bases that New Jersey beats New York ever so slightly,’ the report continued.

Other northeast states ranking in the bottom 10 include Rhode Island (46th), Vermont (45th) and Connecticut (42nd).

The business group Unshackle Upstate says the ranking is further evidence that bold, broad-based tax relief is needed for families and businesses.

"We must take bold steps to improve our job-killing tax climate," said Brian Sampson of Unshackle Upstate. "A stronger economy starts with lower taxes and the Tax Foundation's report shows that we've got work to do."

Agree to disagree: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (left) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (right) both feel their state offers economic advantages over their neighbor

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has established two tax commissions that will recommend ways to simplify the tax law and cut taxes.

Cuomo and the Legislature have extended an income tax surcharge on top earners and a business tax that together have generated more than $2 billion in additional tax revenue annually since 2010. That election year Cuomo and legislators promised no new taxes.

New York wouldn’t need to do much to dig itself out of last place, the foundation said.

‘If even slight improvements were made to New York’s tax system, New York has the opportunity to beat New Jersey,’ said the report, whose findings hae ben disputed by New York officials.

Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said the Tax Foundation's conclusions conflict with other performance measures.He said the state unemployment is 6.9 percent, which is under the national rate of 7.3 percent, and Forbes magazine recently ranked New York 21st among states in comparing business climates.

"Over the last three years, New York State has added more than 300,000 private sector jobs, received a positive outlook from Standard & Poor's and Moody's (credit rating services), reduced barriers and lowered taxes for businesses and put the state on secure fiscal footing," Azzopardi said.

Those looking for tax shelters close to home might want to move to Wyoming, South Dakota or Nevada, the three states with the best tax climates, according to the report.

For New Yorkers, like their sports teams, there’s always next year.
