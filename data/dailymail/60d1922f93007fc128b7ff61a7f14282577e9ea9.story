A mother-of-three was kicked out of hospital in the middle of the night and made to walk two hours home wearing just a dressing gown after doctors misdiagnosed her.

Nicky Moore, 42, was rushed to Royal Bournemouth Hospital with stomach pains but she was told she had gastroenteritis, given painkillers and discharged at 3am.

Ms Moore had no car or money on her and her husband, Roger, was at home with the couple's children so couldn't collect her. When the hospital refused to drop her because they had no vehicles, she walked the four miles home in her pyjamas and dressing gown and in severe pain.

Later that day her pain got worse and she was readmitted to the same hospital where an ultrasound scan revealed she actually had gallstones.

She stayed in the Dorset hospital for six days and is now on an emergency waiting list to have her gallbladder removed.

'I was in agony when I left hospital and it was the middle of the night,' said the Christchurch woman, who has now lodged a formal complaint against the hospital.

'I told the doctor, a nurse and the hospital receptionist that I had no transport and no money to pay for a taxi.

'My husband Roger was at home with our three children and, even if I could have contacted him, we don't have a car so he couldn't have picked me up.'

She said a nurse tried to arrange for a hospital car but there were none available.

'No one suggested I could wait in the hospital until transport was available or offered me the use of a phone, it was busy and I got the impression they just wanted me to go,' Ms Moore said.

'I was in shock as I set off and kept having to stop to take shelter from the rain and because I was in pain.

'Several police cars passed me but, even though I was in my dressing gown, no one pulled up to help.

She said that by the time she reached Christchurch the street lights had been switched off and the couple's estate was in darkness.

'I could have been attacked or collapsed and died from exposure,' Ms Moore said.

'My husband thought I was being kept in hospital overnight so he was asleep when I finally got home, two hours after being discharged.

'I'm really angry and believe the hospital should apologise, apart from receiving the wrong diagnosis I feel I was treated very badly.'

The hospital confirmed they'd received an official complaint from Ms Moore and are investigating the case.

'The emergency department continuously meets its obligations to see and treat patients in a timely way, individual to their personal needs,' a hospital spokesman said.

'Patients also have 24-hour access to phones to make their own transport arrangements. While the Trust has limited, non-emergency transport resources, patients must meet medical or social criteria to be eligible for these.

'Where a patient is not eligible they are required to arrange their own transport.'
