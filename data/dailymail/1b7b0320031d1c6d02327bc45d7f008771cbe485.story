From helping to raise the curtain on the spectacularly successful London Olympics, to the announcement that Prince William and his wife Kate are expecting their first child, 2012 has been a remarkable year for the royal family.

As the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year draws to a close, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have chosen an image that recalls the spirit of celebration that swept through Britain during 2012 for their official Christmas card.

The card features a picture of the smiling couple during June's spectacular Thames river pageant organised in honour of the Queen's 60 years on the throne.

Seasons greetings: The Prince of Wales and wife Camilla have chosen a picture of themselves on board the Spirit of Chartwell during the Diamond Jubilee pageant for their official Christmas card

Charles and Camilla were on board the Spirit of Chartwell alongside the Queen, Prince Philip, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry.

The Prince of Wales wore his Royal Navy admiral's ceremonial day dress uniform for the event, while the Duchess of Cornwall had braved the rain in an Anna Valentine coat and dress and a hat by Philip Treacy.

The nautical spectacle, which was Prince Charles' suggestion, saw 1,000 vessels sail along the Thames watched by huge crowds lining the banks of the river.

The ceremony kicked off a long bank holiday weekend of celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

'Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year': The card features a simple festive message from the couple

The picture, taken by Danny 
Martindale, is inside the Christmas card alongside the simple message: 
'Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year'.

The front of the card is emblazoned with the feather symbol of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall's cipher.

Last
year the couple chose a photograph from William and Kate's wedding day 
for their official Christmas card.

It featured a picture 
of Prince Charles holding up his step-granddaughter Eliza Lopes on the 
balcony of Buckingham Palace next to a smiling Camilla.

The photo of the Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall with bridesmaid Eliza Lopes appeared on their Christmas card last year
