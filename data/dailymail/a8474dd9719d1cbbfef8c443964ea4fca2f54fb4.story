The remains of eight Royal Air Force crew members who died in a 1945 plane crash have been buried in Malaysia.

The lost RAF crew of the Liberator bomber had been listed as missing ever since the aircraft struck a tree and came down in the dense forest in Malaysia.

But today the men were buried in a single grave with full military honours at a Commonwealth War Grave Commission cemetery in Kuala Lumpur.

Military honours: : The remains of eight Royal Air Force crew members who died in a 1945 plane crash have been buried in Malaysia

Unaware: A picture of the crew with their plane before the accident. The lost RAF crew of the Liberator bomber have been listed as missing ever since the aircraft struck a tree and came down in the dense forest in Malaysia in August 1945

In 1991, the part-buried wreckage was discovered 
in by a local tribesman, but it took another 18 years for a proper 
archaeological dig to take place.

The eight airmen actually died several days after the end of the Second World War.

The
 RAF Liberator KL654 from the long-range 356 Squadron was tasked with 
dropping supplies to prisoners of war in central Malaysia at the time.

It
 is thought the tailplane of the bomber struck a tall tree, causing a 
catastrophic loss of control sending the plane spinning into the jungle.

Poignant: Family members and army personnel pay respect during the ceremony

Remembrance: A family member scatters earth soil during the burial. The men have now been buried with full military honours at a Commonwealth War Grave Commission cemetery in Kuala Lumpur

Tragic: The men lost their lives when their aircraft crashed near Seremban, Malaysia, due to poor weather

No message or signal was sent from the crew and it was assumed the plane either crashed in the sea or in the jungle.

The
 bomber was found in 1991 in the jungle of Kuala Pilah.

But it wasn’t 
until 2007 that the British defence attache to Malaysia and the 
Malaysian Army visited the crash site.

They discovered a plate bearing the serial number of the engine fitted to Liberator KL654 but no human remains at that time.

In
 July 2009 a private expedition to the site was carried out and the 
group of British and Malayan volunteers found 63 human bones.

The excavation uncovered the remains 
of the crew as well as some of their personal effects, including 
identity tags and a wedding ring.

Forensic experts commissioned by the Ministry of Defence identified them as being the crew of KL654.

Today their relatives, who included the 
brother of FO Dovey, attended the poignant service at which members of 
the RAF Queen’s Coloured Squadron carried the Union Flag-draped coffin.

The men’s remains were interred in a single grave while a bugler played the Last Post.

Nick Bromfield, 53, the nephew of FO Bromfield said: 'John was the youngest of four brothers.

'My father Geoff died in 2004 and obviously never knew what happened to his brother.

'The whole family adopted a very stoic attitude and stiff-upper lip over it.

'But I know that my father was very 
proud of John and would have been very pleased to know what had happened
 to him and that he has now been given a proper grave.

'I feel very honoured to have been able to represent my family at the funeral.'

Mr
 Bromfield, a solicitor from Canterbury, Kent, added: 'John’s identity 
tags were handed to me at the service and I did have to bite my lip.'

FO Dovey’s brother John, 74, said: 'We think about him every day and finally finding out how he died is a relief.

'I was seven when he died, but I have memories of us at the seaside.'

Nicola Taylor, the niece of FS Blakey, said: 'We had always thought they had crashed into the sea.

'We’re very grateful to everyone involved for helping to find out what really happened.'

Simon Featherstone, the British high commissioner to Malaysia, said: 'It has been 67 years since the crash and now the servicemen, who tragically lost their lives for their country, have finally been laid to rest.

'I’m glad the family members have been able to pay their last respects and the men accorded the military honours they deserve.'
