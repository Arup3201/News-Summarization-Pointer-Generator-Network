Adnan Januzaj must have hoped that between Angel di Maria being sent off and Antonio Valencia's poor defending, eyes would be off him for Manchester United - but his blatant dive at Old Trafford was clear to see for everyone, including the referee.

The United youngster now has five yellow cards for diving compared to four goals, and added to the embarrassment for Louis van Gaal's side in their FA Cup defeat by Arsenal with his blatant simulation attempt in the 87th minute on Monday night as the 10-man home side chased the lead.

Making it into the penalty area ahead of Nacho Monreal, the Belgian went to ground in search of a late penalty but instead the only reaction Michael Oliver gave him was to dish out a yellow card.

The referee got an earful from the Stretford End faithful and United captain Wayne Rooney but was right to caution Januzaj, who made it into the all-time Barclays Premier League top two  for simulation bookings in his first full season in United's first team.

Sportsmail's Graham Poll agreed with Oliver's decision and was impressed with his performance, saying: 'Oliver was brave and correct again when Adnan Januzaj clearly dived in front of the Stretford End – some players never learn.'

Di Maria had already been booked for diving by Oliver, moments before he earned a second yellow card for inexplicably grabbing the official.

And between him and Januzaj, the home side were left even more embarrassed at Old Trafford while Arsenal fans rejoiced in the stands - and that was already after two defensive errors was their final hope of a trophy extinguished. A bad night for Van Gaal's men.
