Seized: Fifty three king cobras have been seized from a car in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi

Fifty-three king cobras have been seized from a car in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi. 

The live snakes were taken to a wildlife rescue centre near the city where were treated before being released into the wild. 

King cobras are the world's longest of all venomous snakes and can grow up to 18ft long. 

Preying on other reptiles, including other snakes, king cobras have a rapid, deadly strike. 

The venom is not as strong as some snakes, but enough is produced in a single bite to kill a fully grown elephant.

The meat of king cobras is considered a delicacy by some in Vietnam.

But hunting and selling the snakes are banned.

The man driving the car was arrested according to police who found the animals in green sacks on Friday.

Officer Dang Van Hanh said the driver told police he was paid under $50 to transport them.
