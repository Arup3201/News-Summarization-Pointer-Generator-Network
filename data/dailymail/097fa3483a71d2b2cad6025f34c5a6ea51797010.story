This is the horrifying moment a teenage boy fling himself off a cliff into a sea of jagged rocks - before limping onto the shore.

Geared on by a crowd of friends, he only had room for a few steps' run up before attempting to leap over the perilous stones.

It is the latest case of so-called tombstoning, which has caused 20 deaths and 76 severe injuries in Britain in less than a decade.

Perilous: The teenager squints as he aims his feet to land inches away from the jagged rocks of the sea in Porthleven, Cornwall, after jumping from a cliff

Painful: He winces in apparent pain, crashing into the shallow water. It is the latest case of 'tombstoning' - where youngsters jump upright from cliffs into the sea

The dangerous sport - dubbed 'tombstoning' because jumpers try to stay upright as they hit the water - sees youngsters throw themselves into shallow waters from dozens of feet in the air.

Propelling himself off the top of a cliff in Cornwall known as the 'pill box', this boy clamped his eyes shut.

He moved his arms and legs wildly in a desperate bid to make it over the 15ft stretch of stone between the cliff base and the sea.

Incredibly, his feet appeared to hit the water inches away from the jagged rocks.

But he emerged from the water wincing and limping to the shore - as his friends prepared to take their own leap.

Last week, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) issued a fresh plea to teenagers to stop the activity after footage emerged of 'the most dangerous yet'.

Life-threatening: The boy wildly moved his arms and legs to push himself forwards. The activity has claimed the lives of 20 Britons in less than a decade, figures reveal

Leap: The group of boys geared each other on as they prepared to leap over 15 feet of stone to reach the rock-ridden waters below the cliff, called the 'pill box'

The video captured a group of teenagers jumping from 35ft into water filled with jagged rocks in Old Portsmouth, Hampshire.

Although the beach at the Hot Walls is not patrolled by lifeguards, it has become a notorious hotspot for tombstoning.

Rogan Wheeldon, RNLI lifeguard supervisor, said: 'Tombstoning anywhere is incredibly dangerous but this footage is some of the most dangerous I've ever seen.

'These people are jumping from about 35ft into shallow water which hides jagged rocks on the seabed. They are risking their lives, there is no doubt about it.'

Warning: This latest incident comes just days after the RNLI issued a warning to teenagers to avoid the activity during summer as there aren't enough lifeguards

He added: 'Our advice is simple. Please don't tombstone. You will be risking broken limbs, paralysis or death for a quick thrill. It's not worth it.

'In this spot in Portsmouth there are also very strong water currents of six to eight knots which can sweep you out to sea. The best way to enjoy the seaside safely is to swim between the red and yellow flags at a lifeguarded beach.'

In 2008, a man was paralysed and confined to a wheelchair when he jumped into the water from Southsea Pier in a tombstoning incident.

The safety appeal comes as the RNLI launches a major drowning awareness campaign called Respect the Water.
