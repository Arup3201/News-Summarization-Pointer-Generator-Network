Margaret Thatcher may have been aware that Alan Clark was having an affair when she appointed him as a minister, newly-released papers reveal.

In a previously secret note to Mrs Thatcher, her principal private secretary urges her not to allow ‘this absurd girl’ to prevent the serial womaniser’s appointment.

The note does not spell out who the girl is, but Mr Clark’s many affairs are well known and documented by his biographer who had access to his personal papers.

Look the other way: Margaret Thatcher may have been aware that Alan Clark was having an affair when she appointed him as a minister

There is no reply by Mrs Thatcher to Ian Gow’s note, but he received his first ministerial posting as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Employment in 1983.

In 1986, he was promoted to Minister for Trade at the Department of Trade and Industry.

He is known to have had many mistresses – which may have included his Commons secretary Alison Young who he asked to marry him, but who denies an affair.

In the note, of August 25, 1983, top of the list for promotion into government is Alan Clark.

Mr Gow and he writes next to his name: ‘I really think that we cannot allow this absurd girl to prevent his advancement.’

Alan Clark's affairs were well-documented and numerous

The sentence is believed to be a reference to one of Mr Clark’s mistresses.

The scale of his affairs became clear when his diaries were published and through various kiss and tells, including one with the wife and daughters of a South African judge who went public.

In his biography, author Ion Trewin set out the pain of his long-suffering wife Jane, who endured his many affairs and the aftermath of the publication of his diaries.

Mr Trewin said yesterday that the woman may have been one of the South Africans who Clark referred to as the ‘coven’.

Once, Mr Clark even described Mrs Thatcher as ‘very attractive - I never came across any other woman in politics as sexually attractive in terms of eyes, wrists and ankles’.
