Tragic: Jemima Prees died after losing control while skiing at the popular Mayrhofen resort where she was staying with family

A ten-year-old girl has died after skiing head-first into a tree at high-speed on a holiday in the Alps.

Jemima Prees was on the slopes in the Austrian Tyrol with her family.

Although said to have been a good skier, she careered out of control and ploughed into a wooded area off-piste.

The schoolgirl from the Wiltshire village of Colerne was wearing a helmet but this did not prevent her suffering massive injuries to her head as well as her upper body in Sunday’s crash.

Her father Tim, a lawyer, and teenage brother were on the slopes with her but could only look on in horror.

Witnesses have reported hearing screams immediately after the crash.

Her 19-year-old brother Barney frantically gave her first aid before a helicopter with paramedics landed not far from an area crowded with tourists.

Jemima was airlifted from the Mayrhofen resort to a hospital in Innsbruck.

She failed to recover from her injuries and died yesterday morning. Jemima’s mother Karen, 46, who is a GP, had returned to the bottom of the mountain by cable car before the crash.

A witness said Jemima ‘was on the piste with her brother and father’.

‘She was a good skier. But suddenly she got faster and faster and she could not control her speed.

‘She suddenly careered off the side of the piste and went head first into a tree. She hit it brutally at high speed.

Jemima Prees was described as 'a lovely little girl - the apple of her parents' eye' by a neighbour in the village where she lived

‘Her brother gave her first aid and 
she was alive when the paramedics arrived. She was airlifted to hospital
but her injuries were too severe. She could not be saved.’

Another skier who saw the tragedy 
said: ‘I heard a lot of screaming. A short while later I saw the 
helicopter landing at the scene.’

A member of the mountain rescue team 
said: ‘The child was in a bad condition. She was wearing a helmet, but 
they cannot protect you from all injuries.’ A shop worker in Colerne 
described Jemima as ‘a lovely little girl – the apple of her parents’ 
eye’. A neighbour said the family had decided to donate Jemima’s organs 
to help others.
