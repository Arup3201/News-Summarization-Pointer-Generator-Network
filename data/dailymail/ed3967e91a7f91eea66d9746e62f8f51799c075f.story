Dean Lyness will go down in Fleetwood Town folklore after the Lancashire club made history on Monday.

The
 Burton Albion goalkeeper conceded the only goal of the game, making a 
terrible hash of Antoni Sarcevic’s long-range free-kick as Fleetwood 
won a tight League Two play-off final and clinched promotion to League 
One for the first time.

Fleetwood’s rise up the  English football ladder has been remarkable. 

This third incarnation of the west Lancashire club was only born in 1997 when they entered the 10th tier of English football in Division One of the North West Counties Football League.With six promotions in the past nine years, their ascent has also been rapid.

That success has come since chairman Andy Pilley took over in 2003. Back then, Town’s  Highbury Stadium had  windows falling in and Pilley’s first game in charge drew 80 spectators.

Manager Graham Alexander, appointed in 2012, explained: ‘It all comes down to the ambition of the chairman. We’re always believing we can smash through any glass ceilings on top of us.‘We’re proving we can achieve. That’s what the chairman spoke to me about when I came here. It’s down to a lot of people  pulling in the same direction. You’ve got to have that drive.’

Fleetwood are based in a small fishing 
town, five miles north of Blackpool, with a population of less than 
30,000. It took the club  just two seasons to make it out of League Two 
after spending only two in the Conference.

And when they went up to 
League Two in 2012 it was the first time, since the club  originated in 
1908, that they had ever been in the Football League.

Victory will be
 celebrated on the Fylde coast but for Albion it was a terrible way to 
lose such an important match — and Lyness will be keen to forget it 
quickly. With 15 minutes left, Fleetwood won a seemingly innocuous 
free-kick 35 yards from goal out on the left.

Midfielder Sarcevic, who was at Manchester City’s youth academy between the age of seven and 15, sent a high ball into the box.

Lyness dashed from his goal to claim it, ran too far and then could only flap at the ball as it sailed over his head and in.

It
 was Sarcevic’s 15th goal of the season and probably the one he least 
expected to see go in the net, but Burton manager Gary Rowett refused to
 blame his keeper.

‘I told him to get his chin up,’ said Rowett. 
‘Unfortunately, a lot of these games we’ve seen in the last few weeks — 
play-off finals, the Champions League final — often a mistake dictates 
the result and defines a close game. That’s what it did.

‘Dean’s been
 excellent. I can’t be disappointed with him, he’s going to be 
disappointed enough with himself. He’s got to learn from it.’

In the
 end, it was a deserved win. Fleetwood were unlucky not to go ahead in 
the opening two minutes when striker David Ball had a ferocious shot 
pushed over.

From the resulting corner he got his head to the cross 
only four yards out but Lyness somehow got his body behind the ball to 
keep it out.
