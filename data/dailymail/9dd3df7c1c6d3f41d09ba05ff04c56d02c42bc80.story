Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta... household names who will be hoping to fly the Argentine flag high and proud in Brazil.

Javier Mascherano and Angel Di Maria will also have crossed the radar of anyone with the vaguest interest in Spain’s El Clasico.

But not all of coach Alejandro Sabella’s squad are quite as high profile. Here is Sportsmail's pocket guide to Argentina 2014.

Preparations: Lionel Messi (second right) and Co will be desperate to win the World Cup in Brazil this year

Sergio Romero (Sampdoria) Age: 27.

Has been on loan at Monaco. The 6ft 4ins keeper has two taller brothers, who are basketball players. Won a Dutch League title with AZ Alkmaar and helped Sampdoria get promoted to Serie A. First-choice Argentina keeper for several years – played in 2010 World Cup.

Pablo Zabaleta (Man City) Age: 29.

Needs no introduction to Barclays Premier League followers. The right back is a no-nonsense defender who can switch instantly into an attack threat. Great vision, great crossing ability and a veteran member of the Argentine national squad.

Ezequiel Garay (Benfica) Age: 27.

First World Cup for a central defender with an eye for a goal. Moved to Benfica in 2011 after only a handful of appearances at Real Madrid, where a certain Jose Mourinho wasn’t convinced. Garay arrived for £4.5m as Fabio Coentrao moved in the opposite direction for ten times as much.

Federico Fernandez (Napoli) Age: 25.

Central defender who has been labelled the ‘weakest link’ by regular Argentina watchers. A year ago seemed to be on his way out of Napoli but played 32 times for Rafa Benitez in a Serie A team which won the Coppa Italia and finished third in Serie A.

Marcos Rojo (Sporting Lisbon) Age: 24.

Left back who has caught the eye of scouts all over Europe this season. Favoured by Argentine coach Alejandro Sabella since overcoming a dodgy season at Spartak Moscow two years ago.  

Javier Mascherano (Barcelona) Age: 30.

Another familiar name to Premier League fans. Formerly of West Ham and Liverpool and, since 2010, a stalwart of Barcelona.

Vastly experienced, can drop into defence, break up play, and spark counter-attacks. So, not bad then.

Fernando Gago (Boca Juniors) Age: 28.

Playing his first World Cup after missing out on 2006 and 2010.

Defensive midfielder whose Real Madrid career was ultimately blighted by injury which led to moves to Roma and Valencia before going back to where it all started with Boca. Also married to tennis player Gisella Dulko.

Angel Di Maria (Real Madrid) Age: 26.

Man of the match in the Champions League final, on a night when he was the only Real Madrid player to shine throughout.

Can play as midfielder, out wide, up front – anywhere he does not have to tackle.

Widely tipped to be on his way out when Gareth Bale arrived last summer, Di Maria has reacted on the pitch.

Lionel Messi (Barcelona) Age: 26.

Extraordinary as this may sound, but the magical little Leo has still to convince many in Argentina.

Often accused of failing to take his club form on the international stage (sound familiar, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Steve McManaman?). Had injury problems last season but has the key to unlock any door.

Sergio Aguero (Man City) Age: 26.

A question mark over the striker’s fitness remains after a season of thigh strains but he still managed 28 goals. Fabulous forward with the golden ability to score from nothing.

Gonzalo Higuain (Napoli) Age 26.

Probably
 going to be the forward prong behind whom Messi, Di Maria and Aguero 
will support. Higuain scored 17 goals in his first Serie A season after 
leaving Real Madrid and managed four in five Champions League fixtures 
before Napoli dropped into the Europa League. He has a better World Cup 
record than Messi, too – four in four in South Africa.

And don’t forget...

Martin Demichelis (Man City) Age: 33.

A surprise package in this squad, much like he has been at City. When Manuel Pellegrini tempted his former Malaga defender out of Spain last year eyebrows were raised.

Clangers plus a red card against Barcelona did little to stop the scoffing but Demichelis stuck in there and began to show real quality. So much so, that he is back in the national squad after three years, axed because of a mistake against Bolivia.

Maxi Rodriguez (Newell Old Boys) Age: 33.

Still going strong two years after leaving Liverpool. Oozes class, the midfielder/winger can be an impact player from the bench.

Ezequiel Lavezzi (Paris SG) Age: 29.

One of the hottest properties around two years ago when he was scoring goals for fun with Napoli, leaving to his big move to France.

The striker was a shock absentee from the World Cup squad four years ago and is down the pecking order now but has the capacity to trouble defences.
