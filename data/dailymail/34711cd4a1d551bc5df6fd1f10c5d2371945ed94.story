After hundreds of accusations that claim Jimmy Savile molested hundreds of youngsters, the disgraced DJ has been caught on live TV groping a petrified teenager.

Sylvia Edwards can be seen sitting next to the blonde presenter on Top Of The Pops as he announces the next song to viewers, surrounded by a group of teenage girls, after the recording appeared on You Tube.

But then a horrified Sylvia leaps off of her chair, shrieks and tried to move away from smirking Savile, who calmly talks into the camera.

Hundreds claim they have been victims to Savile's wandering hands

The presenter grins as he shoves his hand up her skirt, tries to grab her bottom and fondles her - as she clearly looks distressed and attempts to wriggle free from him.

The young blonde, who was then a trainee hairdresser, told The Sun that she was so upset she ran to a BBC employee and told them how the pervert had mauled her - but was told to 'get lost' because Savile was only 'messing about'

The 55-year-old recalls how her assault was dismissed, even though it was patently obvious she was being groped.

The mother-of-two, who was 19 at the time, recalled how the male employee was furious at her for complaining about the alleged pervert's wandering hands, The Sun reported.

She claims she was branded as stupid and says that as a shy teenager she did not have the courage to pursue her complaint.

Savile was 50 at the time of the recording on November 25, 1976 in the BBC's West London TV Centre.

Now, 36 years later, Ms Edwards says that she can remember every terrifying moment of Savile's attack, she told The Sun.

She said: ''I felt his fingers go towards my bottom. It was disgusting.

'...He just laughed and carried on mauling me while talking to the camera.'

Despite Sylvia's clear discomfort, 
the alleged pervert smirks as he says: 'I tell you something, a fella 
could get used to this, as it happens, he really could get used to it.'

Sylvia,
from Twickenham, south London, blasted the sexual predator as being 
'casual' as he sexually assaulted her, The Sun reported.

She also blames the attack for creating upsetting memories, which contributed to the collapse of her marriage nine years ago.

A
BBC spokesman said: We are horrified at these allegations. When 
allegations of this nature are made they will be passed to the BBC's 
investigation team or directly to the police.'

Ms Edwards' claims come as Savile's devastated family have finally spoken
out about the slew of sex abuse allegations that have destroyed his 
reputation and 'shattered' their lives.

Savileâ€™s
nephew, Roger Foster said that the claims have left the family in 
turmoil and has offered sympathy to the hundreds who accuse the Jim'll 
Fix It Star of molesting them.

Retired
deputy headteacher Mr Foster questioned when the string of obscene 
allegations would eventually stop and said the family were having to 
endure fresh pain at the claims every day.

He also applauded the courage victims had for speaking out about their alleged abuse.

His comments came as it was revealed 
that Savile could be the first person to be posthumously stripped of a 
Papal knighthood after the Archbishop of Westminster has asked for it to
be removed, the BBC reported.

The
head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales has asked the Vatican 
to consider removing the honour, as senior members of the Church are 
unhappy that the disgraced star's name remains on the papal honours 
list.

It has also been claimed alleged sexual predator Savile held weekly meetings with a group of senior police officers at his home, even as he was being investigated over a series of abuse cases.

A friend of Jimmy Savile told The Times newspaper that members of the presenter's 'Friday Morning Club' - said to have met at his penthouse regularly over a period of 20 years - included up to nine serving and retired police officers.

There is no suggestion that the men involved were aware that Savile was involved in abuses, or that he was being investigated in relation to allegations of child abuse by officers in other parts of the country.

Most of the officers who attended the were from West Yorkshire Police, according to the report.

Joseph Barker, a friend of Savile's since primary school, told the newspaper how he would 'hold court' during the sessions, which revolved around 'tea and light conversation', and claimed Princess Diana had been known to telephone the broadcaster during the meetings.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said that while the force had not investigated Savile in the past, it had received calls from victims in the wake of recent media coverage. The spokesman added that none of the allegations related to failure by police to investigate previously.

He said that the force had no information about officers attending Savile's Friday Morning Club but that they were free to do what they wished when off duty.
