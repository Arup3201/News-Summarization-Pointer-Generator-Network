David Cameron last night vowed to strip Scottish MPs of the power to decide policy on health, education and tax rates in England.

The Prime Minister said the introduction of ‘English votes for English laws’ at Westminster was a matter of ‘fairness’ in the wake of Scottish devolution, and vowed to make it a priority if he wins the election.

His decision to include income tax rates among the areas on which Scottish MPs will lose the vote could cause havoc for a future Labour government, or any administration propped up by the SNP.

The intervention followed talks in Edinburgh on Thursday with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who beforehand had enraged Tory MPs by threatening to end her party’s policy of not voting on English matters at Westminster.

Mr Cameron described the talks as ‘businesslike’ but said Scotland’s First Minister was ‘wrong’ to end the SNP’s bar on voting on devolved matters at Westminster. 

He had travelled to Scotland to outline a raft of new powers for the Edinburgh parliament that were promised in the run-up to last year’s independence referendum, including tax powers enabling it to raise 60 per cent of its budget.

Scotland will also gain control of £2.5billion of welfare spending, on top of its existing powers over education, health and justice.

And it will be able to extend the voting age in Scottish polls to 16 and 17-year-olds, in time for the Holyrood election next year.

Miss Sturgeon reignited the debate about English devolution on Wednesday by warning the SNP would end its ‘self-denying ordinance’ on voting on matters such as health at Westminster.

The move was seen as paving the way for a post-election deal in which the SNP could prop up a minority Labour government in return for more powers and cash for Scotland.

It also helps to neutralise Labour’s central message north of the border that a vote for the SNP risks a Conservative government at Westminster.

Yesterday Mr Cameron indicated there would be no further devolution to Scotland, describing the new powers as ‘the resting place’ for the issue, while the SNP said the proposals did not go far enough.

He made clear that the new powers for Scotland will come in parallel with a reduction in the voting rights of Scottish MPs. 

He also suggested the issue would be a ‘red line’ in any coalition talks, pledging to act on it if he remains as prime minister.

He said: ‘You will get in full these [devolution] measures, set out in a Bill in the first Queen’s Speech of any government I lead. 

'But there will also be very clearly set-out rules put in place so that English MPs have the decisive say on issues that only affect England. 

'I think that is fair and right.’

Mr Cameron also said the proposals would prevent Scottish MPs having a decisive say on income tax rates in England – potentially making it difficult for a future Labour government to pass its Budgets.

He said: ‘It wouldn’t be appropriate for English constituents to have a rate of tax essentially imposed on them by Scottish Members of Parliament.’

Mr Cameron said the Conservatives would set out their proposals on the issue ‘within days’. 

Options include a complete ban on Scottish MPs voting on English matters, and the introduction of a separate parliamentary stage on which they would be excluded – effectively giving English MPs a veto.

Former Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling warned that barring Scottish MPs from voting on tax would undermine the ‘fiscal integrity’ of the UK. 

He said: ‘We must do nothing in any reforms that ... undermine the fiscal integrity of the UK because if we do that we will end up with all the structures we see in the eurozone, which no one wants to see.’
