A long-lost Orson Welles film has finally had its U.S. premiere some 75 years after the unfinished silent movie was produced by the cinema genius. 

Too Much Johnson, which pre-dates his masterpiece debut Orson Welles, was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse and had its first ever American screening in Rochester, New York on October 16.

The
film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette
play and stars Joseph Cotten - who was to collaborate with Welles again
in the 1941 Citizen Kane and again in 1949's The Third Man. The play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped.

Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made

Welles died in 1985 and believed that the only remaining copy of the film had burned up in a 1970 fire that had destroyed his home in Spain

The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film

The U.S. screening took place at the Dryden Theater at the George Eastman House, where experts restored the 35 mm nitrate work print of the film.

Italian film archivists announced in August that a copy of 'Too Much Johnson originally believed destroyed in a fire had been found in a box by a shipping company in Pordenone, a northeastern Italian city that's home to the Le Giornate del Cinema Muto silent film festival where the film had it global premier earlier this month.

The film was turned over to a local film society, but the find seemed of no particular value and was left unopened for many years. Circo Giorgini, an Italian expert on Welles, identified the film about three years ago.

The only remaining copy was believed to have been burned up in a 1970 fire that destroyed Welles' home in Madrid, Spain. Welles died in 1985. How the film arrived in Pordenone remains a mystery.

The film was supposed to accompany a stage production of a William Gillette play, but the play opened without the film in August 1938 and flopped

Film accompaniment: Orson Welles wanted his 40-minute, three-act film to be prologues for the three acts of a William Gillette play he was putting on at the Mercury Theater

'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time,' said Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project.

'Holding in one's hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that's just impossible to describe.'

Welles made the silent slapstick comedy in New York City shortly before heading to Hollywood to film Citizen Kane, considered by many critics to be the best movie ever made.

Too Much Johnson, filmed in 1938, has nowhere near the complexity of Kane or the tense thrills of The Third Man but offers a never-before-seen glimpse at the skills of one of cinema's greats.

It had never been shown in public and 
was at one time lost to Welles himself, who expressed his shock at 
finding a copy in storage at his home near Madrid, Spain.

It
was this copy of the film, which most experts agreed was the only copy,
that was destroyed in a fire at Welles's home in the 1970s.

The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with 20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute introductions for the second and third act

But a virtually pristine print was recently discovered in an Italian warehouse, and has now been restored by George Eastman House.

The film was not intended to stand by 
itself, but was designed as the cinematic aspect of Welles's Mercury 
Theater stage presentation of William Gillette's 1894 comedy.

The play follows the fortunes of a New
York playboy who flees from the violent husband of his mistress and 
borrows the identity of a plantation owner in Cuba - who is expecting the 
arrival of a mail-order bride.

The film was designed to run for 40 minutes, with 
20 minutes devoted to the play's prologue and two 10-minute 
introductions for the second and third act.

Welles wanted it to be a 
silent film in the tradition of the Mack Sennett slapstick comedies, in 
order to enhance the various chases, duels and comic conflicts of the 
Gillette play.

In addition - and typical of Welles's innovation - live music and live sound effects would be synchronized with the footage to provide a 'surround sound' effect for the audience.

But the film was never fully 
finished. It was anticipated that the play would be a flop and Welles 
let the film project die a natural death, putting the footage in 
storage.

He recalled in a 
later interview that he was surprised to find a copy at his home, 
saying: 'I can't remember whether I had it all along and dug it out of 
the bottom of a trunk, or whether someone brought it to me, but there it
was.

Long-time collaboration: The unseen film stars Joseph Cotten - seen here with Welles in 1949's The Third Man. Welles himself said Cotten's performance was amazing, but nonetheless did not want the film shown publicly

Masterpiece: Citizen Kane - the 1941 film written, directed by and starring Orson Welles - is widely regarded as the best film ever made

'I screened it, and it was in perfect
condition, with not a scratch on it, as though it had only been through
a projector once or twice before. It had a fine quality.

'Cotten was magnificent, and I immediately made plans to edit it and send it to Joe as a birthday present.'.

But Welles never allowed the footage to be seen publicly, stating the film would not make sense outside of the full context of the Gillette play

The recent copy was found in a warehouse by the staff of Pordenone arthouse Cinemazero.

Other Mercury Theater actors that appear in the film include Eustace Wyatt, Edgar Barrier, Ruth Ford, Arlene Francis, Mary Wickes, Welles himself and his wife Virginia Nicholson.

The play opened without the film on August 16, 1938 - and flopped.

The unfinished nitrate work print was given by Cinemazero to Italian film archive Cineteca del Friuli, which transferred it to George Eastman House to be preserved with a grant from the National Film Preservation Foundation.

Paolo Cherchi Usai, senior curator of film, who supervised the project for George Eastman House, said: 'This is by far the most important film restoration by George Eastman House in a very long time. Holding in one’s hands the very same print that had been personally edited by Orson Welles 75 years ago provokes an emotion that’s just impossible to describe.'

Despite the fact that it pre-dates Citizen Kane, even Too Much Johnson is not Welles's directorial debut.

In 1934, while still attending The Todd School for 
Boys, he co-directed (with friend William Vance) a short avant garde 
film called The Hearts Of Age.
