He was the legendary British king who, according to prophecy, would return to save Britain in its moment of greatest peril.

Now King Arthur Uther Pendragon, who claims to be a reincarnation of the legendary monarch, has issued a plea to Scots with less than 24 hours to go before the vote that could break up Britain gets underway.

'I do not wish to see Scotland leave the 
Union,' he emphasises in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. 'I'd hate to see them go. I hope to see them stay better together.'

Saving the Union: King Arthur Uther Pendragon has issued a plea to the Scots to stay part of the Union

Pendragon, 60, from Salisbury, leads the Loyal Arthurian Warband, which he describes as the 'political wing' of the Druid community.

As part of his fight for 'truth, justice and honour', he is actively involved in several protest movements and will stand as an independent candidate for the second time during next year's General Election.

But right now, it is the fate of Scotland that is on his mind, with Pendragon telling MailOnline that he would 'hate' to see the people north of the border vote to leave Britain.

'I can see that they've had enough of the Coalition government and 
lets face it, Westminster isn't all that great,' he adds.

'But, like others who live south of the border, I don't want to see them go and I want to keep them in the Union.'

Thought to have lived during the late fifth and early sixth centuries, the original King Arthur is believed to have led the fight against the invading Saxons.

Tintagel, the castle in which the king is said to have been born, still exists in ruined form in Cornwall, although others have claimed that he was Welsh.

Either way, according to medieval romances and the Historia Brittonum, Arthur was a great king who defended Britain from enemies both earthly and supernatural.

In Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae [History of the Kings of Britain], Arthur is depicted as an emperor who established a kingdom that included Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul (France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and parts of Italy, Germany and the Netherlands).

Modern historians often equate him with King Alfred the Great, the Dark Ages ruler of Wessex who led the fight against the invading Danes, eventually stopping them in their tracks.

Whatever the truth of the real King Arthur, one thing is clear.

According to prophesy, King Arthur and his knights will return to Earth to defend Britain at its moment of greatest peril, which, says King Arthur Uther Pendragon, is upon us now.

Should the Scots heed his plea, Pendragon will return to campaigning on the other causes close to his heart: the environment, Stonehenge and the advent of a party-free political system dominated by independents representing their local communities.

'I'm going to be focusing on speaking to 
the people of Salisbury about my belief in free, independent politics for 
the people,' he says passionately.

''I don't believe in political parties. At the moment, you get
 a guy who was born in Wales, lives in Scotland and represents Surrey.

'I would 
like to see independents everywhere. It 
doesn't matter which party you vote for - they are all as bad as each other.

'What I'd like to see is someone from Birmingham saying: "I'm 
from Birmingham and I can represent the people of Birmingham better than anyone else". 
It's about freeing politics.'

Along with his fight for political independence, King Arthur, who was born Timothy John Roth, has another battle on his hands, this time with English Heritage over access to Stonehenge.

One of the leading lights of the British druid community, Pendragon has repeatedly clashed with the body over access to the site and over the treatment of the skeletons interred there.

'In 2008, they took 50 bodies from the Aubrey Holes [graves close to Stonehenge],' he explains. 'They said they were going to do scientific testing on them.

'I'm not against science, technology and all of that but when I asked whether they would put them back afterwards, they said no.

'I've taken them to court
 over that three times. Because at the end of the day, to have those people dug up 
and stored for future research is not OK. That is not the way to respect
 the dead.'

Modern battle: The modern King Arthur Uther Pendragon stands for truth, justice and honour

And that's
 not the only battle Pendragon is fighting. Convinced that the world is 
in greater peril than ever before thanks to corporate greed and 
environmental abuses, he has joined the fight against fracking and also 
campaigns on civil liberties.

'This is the endgame,' he adds. 'This is the time that the Arthur figure has 
returned and I am it. I believe in truth, honour and justice.

'It's 
important for druids to speak out although quite a few don't want to rock the boat. I don't mind rocking the boat - my 
order was set up to do exactly that.'

His order, the Loyal Arthurian Warband, was set up to give a political voice to the Druids and is regularly found campaigning on everything from green issues to housing benefit.

In short, it's Pendragon's modern take on the knights of the round table. 'Was the original Arthur to be here now, he'd be doing what I'm doing,' adds Pendragon.

'The legend of Arthur has been 
romanticised, changed, Christianised... What there really was was an Iron Age leader who rode 
around knocking heads together and that's exactly what I do, only I use a motorbike instead of a horse.'

And his message to those who doubt his claims? 'To people who think that it's nonsense, it probably 
is - in your opinion. But not in mine.

'I'd say forget about all the King Arthur stuff because at 
the end of the day, I want to be judged on what I do and what I achieve 
in this lifetime.

'We fight for truth, honour and justice and anyone who 
wants to follow that creed can follow us. Some people view me as their 
king but you don't have to.

'But it doesn't really matter anyway because at the end of the day, my name really is Arthur and I really am a Druid king.'
