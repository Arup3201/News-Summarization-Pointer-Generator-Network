Mocking: Brazilian paper Lance taunt England

The Brazilian press have revelled in England’s demise.

O Globo’s front page showed a picture of Luis Suarez with the headline ‘The Lad from Liverpool’.

And sports daily Lance had a mock-up of The Beatles’ Abbey Road album cover with Roy Hodgson, Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Daniel Sturridge walking across the zebra crossing with the headline:  ‘Bye Bye’.

It was as much as they deserved.

Light blue invasion

Porto Alegre is just a few hours’ drive from Argentina. And guess who play there on Wednesday?

Yes, Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero, Javier Mascherano and Co will sign off from the group stage against Nigeria and the Brazilian authorities are predicting 200,000 Argentinian fans descending on the port city.

Japan's rubbish draw

Japan supporters armed themselves with blue bin bags during their side’s 0-0 draw with Greece . . . to clean the stadium. Fans made sure the Arena das Dunas was left as they found it after the dire Group C clash in Natal. But the bags proved to be dual-purpose and were also used to cheer on their side.

Brazilian newspaper Folha had to pulp 30,000 copies after they ran a hoax interview with a Luiz Felipe Scolari lookalike.

To add to the confusion over the first 
name of Ivory Coast and Newcastle midfielder  Cheik/Cheick Tiote, he’s 
Ismael on official team sheets.

Name game: Tiote's (left) first name can be spelt in many different ways causing confusion for football fans

Best of the bets

Each day, Sportsmail's top tipsters Brian Lee and Chris Cutmore go head to head with their best bets.

Best bet Brian

7-2: Lionel Messi, used to getting what he wants, has called for Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella to go for the kill against Iran. That should mean Gonzalo Higuain starts and he is a value pick to score the first goal.

Best bet Chris

8-1: You have to admire Iran’s stubborn resistance against Nigeria, even if there was nothing else to admire in that game. Lionel Messi is a tad better than Victor Moses and Argentina can still win with a four-goal handicap.
