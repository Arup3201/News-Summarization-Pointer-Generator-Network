This is the horrific moment an amateur jockey was knocked unconscious and dragged 200 yards bouncing on his head after being thrown off his horse.

Professional accountant Oliver Wadlow's only memory of the freak accident is waking up in the back of an ambulance, with paramedics telling him he was lucky to be alive.

The 24-year-old Bristolian, who rides as a hobby, was attending an amateur Point to Point race in Worcestershire on May 12 when he was flung from his horse.

Impending danger: The jump that led to Mr Wadlow's fall

Terror: Amateur jockey Oliver Wadlow was knocked unconscious and dragged 200 yards bouncing on his head after being thrown off his horse

He tried to swing his left foot over the horse but his boot became caught on the right stirrup, throwing him off balance and leaving him to be dragged along the ground.

Terrified onlookers attempted to halt the animal as the force of the crash had knocked Oliver out cold - he was freed just seconds before the horse jumped the next fence after the saddle ripped off.

Mr Wadlow said: 'It was just a freak accident and I am so lucky to still be alive - never mind being able to walk away from it.

Amazingly, Mr Wadlow was released from hospital the same day and could be back on a horse in just three weeks

The rider was lucky to survive as his head was just a short distance from the animal's powerful hooves

Shock: His parents were in the crowd on the day and watched in horror

'It's something that I could never do again even if I tried - a complete one in a million fluke. It just all happened so fast and I didn't really have time to panic.

'All I saw was the ground and thinking "This is it. It's going to hurt". Next thing I know I'm in the back of an ambulance having bounced on my head down the track.

'In all my years of riding I've never seen something like this before, or heard of it. I was literally a few centimetres away from my head being crushed under the horse's hoof.'

Mr Wadlow's parents were in the crowd on the day and watched in horror as his body bounced sickeningly on the hard earth.

Mr Wadlow said: 'My parents were distraught and shocked to see it but they know horse riding can be dangerous'

But despite the brutal fall, Oliver was released from hospital the same day suffering a broken collarbone and coccyx and could be back on a horse in just three weeks.

Mr Wadlow said: 'My parents were distraught and shocked to see it but they know horse riding can be dangerous.

'I'll definitely be up and riding again, no question about that. It's just whether or not I can make it to ride again before the end of the Point to Point season in June.'

Photographer Richard Dawson captured the distressing scenes and couldn't believe Oliver's luck

He said: 'I'll be back on a horse as soon as I can be - it's just one of those things you have to expect when jumping on the back of these massive and powerful animals.'

Horse riding enthusiast and photographer Richard Dawson captured the distressing scenes and insisted he couldn't believe Oliver's luck.

Mr Dawson, 43, said: 'It was just horrifying to see his fall, very shocking. I couldn't believe what I was seeing as I captured it on camera.

'The young lad's had a very lucky escape - it's a very unusual fall.'

Fears: Bystanders desperately tried to stop the galloping animal
