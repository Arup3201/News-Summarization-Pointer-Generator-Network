Proposal: Lord Warner, who previously advised Tony Blair on health reform, said the levy should be paid before anyone receives free treatment

Everyone should pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS, according to a former Labour health minister.

Lord Warner called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment.

Patients should also be charged £20 for every night they stay in hospital, he added.

He said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the Health Service, which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing, unhealthy population.

There is rising concern that the NHS is running out of money and will soon have to resort to charging patients or rationing common treatments.

Lord Warner, who previously advised Tony Blair on health reform, said the NHS was ‘unaffordable’, ‘out-of-date’ and unable to meet the needs of the population.

In a report written for the Reform think-tank, he estimated that a monthly £10 charge for using the NHS would generate £2billion a year.

Certain groups would be exempt, including the elderly, the under-18s and pregnant women. Patients would not be denied emergency treatment if they had not paid the fee.

Lord Warner recommended introducing a £20 fee for every night a patient stays in hospital.

They would be made to pay extra if their stay was longer than the average for their age group – broken down into the under-65s, 65 to 85 and over-85s.

The fees would generate up to £1billion, while also deterring patients from going to hospital unnecessarily.

Lord Warner said there needed to be a ‘tough conversation with the public’ about new ways of funding the Health Service.

Need for change: The former minister also claimed the health service was 'unaffordable', 'out-of-date' and unable to meet the needs of the population

‘We can no longer pay homage to an out-of-date and unaffordable NHS that’s unfit for today’s and tomorrow’s care needs,’ he said.

‘All politicians allowed the NHS to overdose on higher budgets without shifting more care closer to home and concentrating our specialist services on fewer, safer, more highly-skilled, 24/7 centres.

The day of reckoning has arrived with an obesity epidemic on our doorstep.

‘The NHS has to change radically. It should have no more hand-outs at the expense of other public services.’

But Joyce Robins, of campaign group Patient Concern, was ‘incensed’ by his proposals. ‘Hospitals are dreadful, unsafe places – why would anyone choose to stay there if they could help it? It’s not like they are hotels,’ she said.

‘I can’t imagine who sat in their office and thought this up. It really is a strange idea.’

The Health Service has been struggling to meet the demands of patients – even with its £106billion annual budget ring-fenced from spending cuts – and there have been growing calls for patients to be charged for certain services.

In January, a poll of 800 GPs found that a third were in favour of charging patients up to £10 every time they went to casualty to deter ‘inappropriate attendances’.

Last summer senior doctors from the British Medical Association said the NHS would soon have to make patients pay for some non-urgent treatments and operations.

The NHS Confederation – which represents managers – has also said patients may have to be charged for calling out a doctor and made to pay for hospital meals.

A Labour source said the party rejected Lord Warner’s proposals. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The founding principles of the NHS make it universally free at point of use and we are clear that it will continue to be so.’
