In a World of Golf special, Sportsmail's golf correspondent DEREK LAWRENSON picks out what he is looking forward to most when the best players on the planet descend on Hoylake this week for the 2014 Open Championship.

1) THE RETURN OF TIGER. OK, it’s certainly not the Tiger Woods of 2006 vintage and he might only be around for two days. But we’ve seen enough in practice to suggest he might just surprise one or two people. It will certainly add to the event watching him try.

2) ATMOSPHERE. At Muirfield last year the golf was good, the weather even better but the event was as flat as a pancake. With an extra 80,000 spectators expected through the gates and boosting the overall attendance to around 200,000, things should be a lot different this week.

3) GOOD FRIDAY FOR RORY. Yes, it’s all very fascinating watching Rory McIlroy shoot 63 or 64 in first rounds of tournaments and then allow an imposter to take his place the following day. But this is the Open. So can the real Rory please show up for all four days here and not just three?

4) A STOUT DEFENCE FROM PHIL. Mickelson has been watching a video of his fabled final round last year which is just as well given his results sheet over the past 12 months. Let’s hope the good memories rub off on the popular American. There’s not a lot to beat watching Phil when he thrills.

Consistency issues: Rory McIlroy needs to turn up on all four days at Hoylake if he is to win

5) THE FACTORY MAN. Good to see that the Royal & Ancient have given Hoylake factory worker John Singleton a nice draw alongside American Peter Uihlein and Scot Marc Warren. No unearthly starting time either. The local man tees off in the first round at 10.32am.

6) VIDEO SCOREBOARDS. It’s only right they’ve kept the iconic yellow scoreboard at the 18th but it’s also good they’ve been replaced elsewhere with all-singing, all-dancing scoreboards telling people an awful lot more than simply a player’s hole-by-hole scores.

7) WATCHING TV WHILE WALKING AROUND THE COURSE. How brilliant to be able to follow your favourite player while still catching up with all the action on the BBC. That’s the smartphone promise anyway if you download the Open app, thanks to the internet ‘mesh’ installed. Fingers crossed it works.

8) A HOME CHALLENGE. All corners of the UK have men who are fully capable of contending. True, the Open doesn’t depend on one or two of them making a genuine tilt at winning the Claret Jug, but it tends to be a better championship when they do.

9) SPENDING AN HOUR BESIDE THE PAR-THREE 13TH. With the sun out, there’s no better place to watch than clambering up the bank on the right side and viewing the action on this gorgeous short hole beside the Dee estuary, with Hilbre Island shimmering in the distance.

10) THE PACKED GRANDSTAND AT THE 18TH. The massive grandstands have been a feature of every Open but this year organisers have excelled themselves with the first wraparound stand in history around the final hole. Should be spine-tingling come Sunday.
