FIFA president Sepp Blatter promised  that the Qatar World Cup in 2022 will not ruin Christmas for football fans.

Blatter, arriving in Belfast for the rules-deciding IFAB summit, insisted that the World Cup final will not be played on December 23 as a FIFA workshop floated in Qatar this week when agreeing on a November-December World Cup schedule.

Instead Blatter said that FIFA would recommend that the 28-day tournament would finish no later than December 18, which would potentially allow the Premier League to resume on Boxing Day.

Blatter said: 'We have to stop on the 18th for the finish. Not through to the 23rd, definitely not. No doubt the FIFA ExCo will make the decision that we will play November-December.

'There are more than six years to prepare and there is goodwill. There will be a solution and I'm sure everybody will be fine.'

The FIFA move to end the World Cup on Qatar national day will help at least quieten the upset in Europe over the domestic leagues being disrupted. The timescale allows for the Christmas and New Year football programme to take place.

Blatter added: 'It's not the first time I've said it, it's now more than a year and a half since we decided we can't play in summer. 

'They (the European clubs) are not furious. They may not be very happy, but there are more than six years to prepare for it.

'There is goodwill and there will be a solution. I'm sure everyone will be fine.'

Blatter also rejected any possibility of clubs being compensated for the World Cup's move.

'No I don't think they should (be compensated),' he continued. 'This is not a problem that we have discussed in depth.

'This is football and I'm sure the European clubs are not happy, but they should also be in solidarity. This is the important thing, in FIFA we need unity and solidarity. If there are problems there are discussions about them so that they can be solved.'
