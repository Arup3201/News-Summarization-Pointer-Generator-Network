A mother-of-six was hailed a hero today after she dragged an unconscious neighbour from his  £140,000 Bentley convertible as it exploded into a huge fireball.

Karen Buckland, 39, put 'her life on the line' to save the 49-year driver after she found him slumped at the wheel at the silver GTC supercar as it was bursting into flames on his driveway.

Despite the obvious danger, Mrs Buckland opened the driver's side door of the blazing vehicle then used all of her strength to hoist him to safety. As she did so the fire ripped through the rest of the luxury vehicle - leaving it a burnt out wreck.

Brave: Mother-of-six Karen Buckland has been commended for her bravery after putting her 'life on the line' to save her neighbour

The driver - a wealthy accountant with three children - was later treated in hospital for the effects of smoke inhalation but made a good recovery. He has moved out of the neighbourhood.

Mrs Buckland was today commended for her bravery by Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service.

Mrs Buckland, from Marple, near Stockport, said: 'I actually feel guilty thinking about how I could have saved him sooner and stopped his car exploding. We weren't that friendly, otherwise I would have popped over to say hello earlier.'

Lucky escape: Mrs Buckland managed to drag the 49-year-old man to safety just moment before the entire car went up in flames

Quick thinking: Mrs Buckland could smell electrics burning in her kitchen and heard a huge bang. She then found her neighbour unconscious in his car with the engine compartment on fire

She added: 'My husband nearly had to 
drag me to the awards ceremony - frankly I didn't know what the fuss was
about. I was overwhelmed when I found out the whole thing had been put 
on especially for me.

'The
fact is my 16-year-old our daughter Morgan was there too and she was 
brilliant, taking all the information from the control room and a 
neighbour helped as well - and the crews were obviously also very good.

'I was so touched and lost for words,
all I could say was that these fire fighters do what I did every day - 
they are the real heroes in my opinion.'

The
incident occurred when Mrs Buckland, who works as a director of 
enrichment at a local grammar school came home from work and and after 
dinner realised she could smell burning.

Mrs Buckland, who lives with property 
developer husband Eain, 52, said: 'Eain was still at work, so Morgan and
I were watching television.

'I went to fetch something from the kitchen and smelt an electrical burning smell. I checked on the tumble drier and then shouted upstairs to our friend, who is staying with us, if he knew.

'He told me the man next door, who was still sat in his car, had been revving it. I went to the front door and there was a huge bang. The front of his Bentley was on fire and the flames were spreading fast.

'He was sat behind the wheel with his head facing down and the flames were coming through the windscreen.'

With the flames towering above the car and spreading up the walls of the house - burning the ivy and causing the windows to crack - all Mrs Buckland could think about was rescuing the man before he burned to death.

She said: 'I didn't reason, I just did it. I didn't think about myself or anything else; it's all a bit of a blur but I managed to get him. As I went out, the car exploded and I just thought I had to get him out of there.'

Mrs Buckland grabbed the man under the arms and pulled him from danger while her daughter Morgan called 999 and asked for help.

Morgan took instructions from the GMFRS Control Room and crews from Marple and Offerton fire stations arrived shortly after and tackled the blaze and took over from Karen and gave first aid to the man.

Mrs Buckland said: 'As he lay on the 
ground unconscious, he looked in a bad way - he was singed, covered in 
smoke and foaming and gurgling from the mouth. That image is hard to 
forget.

'Even now I 
drive up to our house, I can spot where the tiles have been replaced in 
next door's driveway because of the damage - and what happens comes 
flooding back. It's a constant reminder.

'It wasn't until later and I saw the damage to the car that I realised how bad the fire was.

'Morgan had some flashbacks, but apart from that we've been okay - we're just happy he's alive.

'I think it would have been much more difficult for us if the outcome had not been a good one.

'It's so fortunate that I went out exactly when I did, it would have been very difficult to get to him.

'I was meant to be there, I was meant to save him - if it had been another minute, it would have been a very different story.

'I didn't think about the danger to me - you do whatever you can to help someone survive and not think about the consequences for yourself.

'The fire also made me understand just how fantastic my daughter is and how calm she can be in a crisis.'

Inquiries revealed the accidental blaze had been caused by an 'over revving' of the car's engine.

County Fire Officer Steve McGuirk said: 'It is without doubt in the minds of all those emergency service personnel who attended the incident on the day that, had Karen not displayed the utmost bravery and ignored the risk to her own life, the man would most certainly have lost his.

'Karen put her life on the line - watched by her family - to save this man and let there be no underestimation of the courage and strength of character that such actions take.'
