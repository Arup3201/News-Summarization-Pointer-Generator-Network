Matt Gilks has been called into the Scotland squad for the European Championship qualifiers against Georgia and Poland.

The Burnley goalkeeper replaces Allan McGregor, who pulled out on Thursday after being told to rest a shoulder injury for six weeks.

Gilks, who has been second choice to Tom Heaton at Turf Moor this season, was recently displaced in the Scotland squad by Craig Gordon.

Gordon has quickly returned to top form with Celtic after overcoming a career-threatening knee injury that kept him out for several years.

Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall started in Scotland's opening qualifier.

That match ended in a 2-1 defeat againast world champions Germany in Dortmund.
