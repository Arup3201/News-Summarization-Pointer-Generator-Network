Derek Rossi, the career armed robber who shot two policemen in a series of horrifying raids, who has now been given a third life sentence

An armed robber has received an astonishing third life sentence after twice being freed to strike again.

The lenience of the criminal justice system was highlighted yet again as a judge yesterday apologised to career criminal Derek Rossi’s two latest victims for the fact that he had been at liberty to attack them.

Rossi, 58, was then given his third ‘life’ sentence – but only with an order that he serves 12 years.Critics said that the case showed the phrase ‘life sentence’ was now just a ‘meaningless lie to reassure the public’.

The thug, who once almost severed a policeman’s arm with a point-blank pistol blast, was caught on this latest occasion after bursting into a bookmakers.

He was traced after he twice fired his shotgun, then dropped it and removed his balaclava to pick it up – which meant he was seen by dozens of witnesses.

But that was little comfort to the two female employees when he demanded money from the safe.

For he was only free to threaten their lives because the parole board first released him after he was jailed for life in 1984 for shooting at policemen, then again after he was jailed for life for holding up a post office in 2000.

Giving Rossi his third life sentence, Judge Peter Clarke said yesterday at Blackfriars Crown Court in London that the staff at the bookmaker, Ann Fairbrass and Hannah Bjorkvall-Green, deserved an apology.

Judge Clarke said: ‘Mrs Fairbrass and Mrs Bjorkvall-Green will be sitting in the public gallery wondering how it is that Rossi could have entered the betting shop where they worked when he was the subject of not one, but two sentences of life imprisonment for attempting to murder police officers and  members of the public while committing robberies.

‘The victims deserve an explanation about why a man who had previous life sentences for robbery was given his liberty. I wish to apologise to them on behalf of the criminal justice system for placing them in that position.’

Judge Clarke added: ‘I’m not convinced by the defendant’s protestations of future good conduct.’

Mrs Bjorkvall-Green told the court that she had been deeply traumatised by the attack, saying: ‘Every time I closed my eyes I could see this man and the gun.’

A villain since his youth, Rossi was given his first life sentence at the Old Bailey in 1984, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 18 years, for ‘terrifyingly violent’ attempted robbery.

Freed from that first ‘life’ sentence, he was swiftly given his second after holding up a post office in Dibden in Hampshire in 2000 – apparently within weeks of leaving prison – with a sawn-off shotgun. He escaped with £16,000.

This second time, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of six and a half years, but ended up serving 12.

However he had not long been released before he launched his latest attack on Ladbrokes in Holborn, central London, at 8am one morning last November.

Last night Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘This is a rare and brave example of a judge pointing out that soft sentences put the public at huge risk.

‘The case shows how the phrase “life sentence” has become a lie that falsely reassures the public. In reality it often means the same inadequate prison term and release after a few years.’
