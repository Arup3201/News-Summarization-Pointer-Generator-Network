Two 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' stars have failed to cough up $20,000 they each pledged to donate to the Detroit Public Schools Foundation in Sunday night's episode - which was filmed nearly six weeks ago.

NeNe Leakes challenged fellow cast member Kenya Moore, a former Miss USA who is from Detroit, to donate the sizable sum to a charity, during part three of a sixth-season reunion of the Bravo TV show.

The move was designed to show that Moore is broke. But Moore agreed, picking the education nonprofit, which supports value-added programs and activities for the benefit of the bankrupt city's schools.

However, the charity hasn't seen a dollar of the apparently generous gifts.

'No we haven't (heard anything about the donations),' Foundation president Glenda Price told MailOnline Tuesday.

'I'm certainly hoping we do hear something. There has been a tremendous amount of interest generated but there hasn't been any official word about contributions.'

Price said she was surprised but overjoyed when she heard news of the intended cash injection.

The two rivals agreed to donate the money during a heated exchange between the two over Leakes' behavior at a charitable event Moore had organized.

'Since you felt that I behaved so badly at your charity event, I will do this for you,' Leakes said.

'Let's
 put our differences aside for a day of charity. You pick the charity of
 your choice. I will donate $20,000, and you match me. You donate 20 
(thousand) along with me. How about that? 20K. You ready? Name the 
charity, and let's go.'

Moore, who is apparently more hard-up than her rival, agreed and, after a few seconds, decided on the Detroit Public Schools Foundation.

'I will write a $20,000 check, and I'd like to see you match me,' Leakes responded.

'All right,' Moore said.

But the show was taped on March 27 and neither housewife has been in touch with the charity about the support, the Detroit Free Press first reported Monday.

Price told the newspaper the foundation was 'gratified to learn that two members of the cast... have pledged support to us for the benefit of DPS students.

'We look forward to official notification of this gift.'

She added to MailOnline: 'We are also grateful for the opportunity to talk about what it is we do.'

Neither the women nor the Bravo network commented to FREEP about the donations.
