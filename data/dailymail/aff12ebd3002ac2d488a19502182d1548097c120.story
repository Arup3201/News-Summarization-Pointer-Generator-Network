Reading midfielder Danny Williams took to Instagram to reveal he was the lucky recipient of a signed James Rodriguez shirt.

Williams posted a picture of himself holding up a Rodriguez Real Madrid No 10 shirt alongside the Colombian superstar.

The duo would have come into contact on Friday night when the USA played Colombia at Fulham's Craven Cottage.

Williams did not feature against the South Americans but was able to meet up with the 2014 World Cup top scorer and swap his USA shirt for one of Rodriguez's club shirts, which he signed.

Rodriguez played the full 90 minutes of the friendly clash and managed to claim an assist in Colombia's 2-1 win against Jurgen Klinsmann's side.

Championship midfielder Williams played just three times for Reading so far this season due to a knee injury which ruled him out of the World Cup.
