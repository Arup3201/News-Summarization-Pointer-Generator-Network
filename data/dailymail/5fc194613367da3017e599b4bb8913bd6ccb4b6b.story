Counter terrorism police sealed off a city block outside Jay Z's New York night club 40/40 after a mysterious individual left an elaborate hoax devise leaning against a phone box next to the venue. 

NYPD counter terrorism officers secured the area around Broadway and 25th Street on Tuesday after they received an emergency call. 

CCTV footage from a camera outside the club showed an individual wearing a baseball cap leaving a wooden plank with wires attached propped up against the phone box.

Officers were forced to conduct a controlled explosion on the device which was later declared a hoax. 

The NYPD is currently trying to track down the man, who was wearing a white hat and dark jeans. After leaving the device, which included a length of pipe and a red flashing light outside the club, he escaped from the scene heading south along Broadway on foot. 

The incident happened at 3.06 on Tuesday morning outside the popular club owned by the hip hop superstar. 

The security operation as a result of the hoax caused some disruption to early morning commuters in Manhattan until the scene was declared safe shortly after 7am. 

The 40/40 club is one of a chain of sports bars and lounges owned by Jay Z. 

It is not known whether the hoaxer was looking to disrupt the club's operation or whether the location of the bomb was entirely coincidental. 

The NYPD asked that anyone with information about the hoax should call Crime Stoppers on 1-800-577-TIPS.
