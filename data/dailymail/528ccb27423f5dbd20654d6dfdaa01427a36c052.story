A rescue dog has stunned her new owner after giving birth to 14 Doberman puppies, setting a new British record in the process.

Keela the two-year-old Doberman was only thought to be carrying five or six pups when she was examined by vets, but ended up giving birth to a monster brood. 

Zara Hayes, 42, who runs the Yappy Ever After dog centre paid £450 for two-year-old Doberman Keela after noticing an online advert saying the animal was 'possibly pregnant'. 

She was worried that the dog would be exploited by its new owners for profit, as Doberman puppies can sell for £1,000, so she put her up for adoption instead.

Keela the Doberman set a new British record for the largest litter when she gave birth to 14 puppies on the rather fitting date of December 14 - beating the previous record of 13

Zara Hayes, 42, paid £450 for Keela after seeing an advert for her online saying she was 'possibly pregnant'. Ms Hayes was concerned the dog would be exploited for profit, so put her up for adoption instead

Assistant pub manager Cat Davis, 33, agreed to take Keela on after vets said she was pregnant with six or seven pups, and was stunned when the monster brood popped out

Cat Davis, 33, from Cardiff, agreed to take care of Keela in October last year after being told she was carrying six pups, slightly less than the average litter of eight, according to the Kennel Club. 

But on the rather fitting night of December 14, Keela gave birth to 14 puppies which have now taken over her house, eating a 5kg bag of dog food per day.

They spend most of their time huddled together in a basket in the corner of her kitchen for warmth, and are so close they all sleep together in one big pile.  

Ms Davis, an assistant manager at a pub, said: 'We couldn’t believe it when 14 came out, and on December 14 as well, it was a weird coincidence.

'They have taken over my house and my life, there isn’t much space left that isn’t taken up by dogs.

'But it is worth it to make sure they are kept safe and sent to loving homes rather than being exploited.

'They all have their own personalities but they are live wires and bundles of energy. The pups are so close they all sleep together in a big puppy heap. They are adorable.

'We are lucky people are donating food because they are going through a bag a day and they certainly let you know when they’re hungry.

'I am glad we have found loving homes for them all but I will definitely miss them when they leave next month.'

The puppies, who all weigh 3-4kg, are being rehomed by Yappy Ever After for their standard minimum adoption fee of £250.

They have already been snapped up by owners who will be coming to collect them a few days after they have their injections on February 9.

One of the puppies is even going to a home as far away in Germany, while the other 13 are off to new families across Britain.

The dogs were known by numbers at first but have now been given names by their new owners which are - Odin, Kaiser, Zeus, Boudicca, Oscar, Boo, Kayla, Wilson, Shadow, Stan, Zeus, Patience, Dylan and Blake.

Ms Davis said her home has now been overrun by the dogs, who are eating a 5kg bag of dog food per day

All 14 pups have now found news homes after being donated to Ms Hayes' rescue centre for the standard fee of £250 each, and one is even being sent to Germany

Ms Davis says one of the puppies wasn't breathing when it was born, but now they are all fighting fit, and will leave her on February 9 after having their injections

Zara, who runs Yappy Ever After dog rescue from Arnold, Notts., watched the birth live as Cat sent her pictures and videos as it happened.

She added: 'I got Keela because my thought was that someone could make a lot of money from the puppies with very little effort.

'I was worried about her not being of use to anyone after giving birth. I am just overwhelmed with the number of puppies to be honest, there were a lot of tears.

'It was a bit of touch and go with the last one because she wasn’t breathing, but they are all fighting strong now.

'We couldn’t believe it when it got to six and then more came out and it kept going up  until 14.

According to the Kennel Club the usual litter size for a Doberman is between eight and nine puppies. Keela had been expected to deliver six, but ended up giving birth to 14

'We have seen that another Doberman had 13 but I am planning to contact Guinness World Records because we think this must be a record.'

Yappy Ever After volunteer Vicky Day, 26, from Arnold, added: 'I was getting regular updates throughout the night as and when the puppies were born so none of us could sleep.

'By the time the 12th one was out I thought it was madness. Fourteen is amazing - I wish I could have been there. Most of all I am pleased they are all healthy and are all going to good homes.'

New mum Keela - who will be neutured so she can’t be exploited in the future - is now going to be adopted by fosterer Cat after the puppies have been rehomed.
