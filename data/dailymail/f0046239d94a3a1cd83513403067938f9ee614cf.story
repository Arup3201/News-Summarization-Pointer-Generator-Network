Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton is to appear in court charged with alleged drink-driving.

Shilton was arrested and bailed to appear at Colchester Magistrates' Court, in Essex, later this month.

The 63-year-old, of Kenilworth, Warwickshire, was arrested outside the Colchester home of his girlfriend, singer Stephanie Hayward, according to The Sun.

A police spokesman said: 'A 63-year-old man will appear at Colchester Magistrates Court on March 19.'

Shilton made more than 1,000 professional appearances and holds the record for playing more games for England than anyone else, winning 125 caps between 1971 and 1990.

Over the course of his 30 year career he played with 11 different clubs including Nottingham Forest, Derby and Southampton, appearing in two European Cup finals.

Shilton was goalkeeper for England during Maradona's infamous 'Hand of God' incident during the 1986 World Cup quarter-final, which Argentina won 2-1.
