The children who survived the Newtown massacre were so traumatized they thought a ‘wild animal’ had torn through their school and killed their classmates.

As they emerged from the blood-spattered building, a boy of seven asked a volunteer firefighter if the carnage had been caused by some a beast of some kind, according to a report.

When she replied yes - to shield him from the full horror -  the children began a chilling whisper amongst themselves which went: ‘A wild animal, a wild animal, a wild animal.’

The disclosure shows how the dozens of children who were inside the building tried to make sense of what was going on in a way they understood.

They had been told to close their eyes as they were led out of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, after the rampage on December 14 last year.

Had they not done so they would have seen the bodies of 20 of their classmates and six of their teachers, plus that of gunman Adam Lanza, 20.

According to an article in the New Yorker magazine, Shannon Hicks, a reporter and photographer with local paper the Newtown Bee and a volunteer firefighter, spoke to one seven-year-old shortly afterwards.

She was on her way to the firehouse, which is 350 yards from the school and where the survivors were taken, when the boy asked her a question.

The New Yorker article reads: ‘He asked her if there had been a wild animal in the building.

‘Yes honey’, she said. As the boy’s class continued to the firehouse she heard the children whispering to each other down the line 'a wild animal, a wild animal, a wild animal.’

The article also reveals that police initially thought that there could be up to 60 victims and tells of the moment that parents realized their children were among the victims.

Mums and dads had been asked to come to the firehouse but as the number of children left to be claimed got fewer and fewer it felt like the ‘room was filling up with some kind of gas’, said John Voket, another reporter with the Newtown Bee.

When one mother realized that her child would not be coming back, a rabbi who was in the firehouse stood by her asking her to breathe.

He said: ‘My focus was cardiac arrest. I didn’t want the physiological reaction to kill her.’

The pupils of Sandy Hook Elementary have not gone back to their classrooms since the tragedy and are being educated at the Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe which was reopened to accommodate them.

The fate of Sandy Hook itself is still being decided by a council board in Newtown which could choose to demolish it.

At two hearings earlier this year the majority of residents said it should be razed to the ground with one parent saying: ‘That ground is sacred now.’
