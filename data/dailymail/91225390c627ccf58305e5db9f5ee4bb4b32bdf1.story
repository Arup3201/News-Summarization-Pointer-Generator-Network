Shaun Edwards (pictured), 46, was spared jail after he admitted the 'appalling and terrifying' attack on 67-year-old Albert Finney

A road rage dentist who knocked out a pensioner's teeth
and broke his cheekbone with a single blow has been declared fit to practise following a year-long ban.

Shaun Edwards, 46, was spared jail after he admitted
the 'appalling and terrifying' attack on 67-year-old Albert Finney. 

The
former Army major leapt out of his black BMW and issued his victim with the
chilling warning: 'If you knew who I am, you wouldn't tangle with me.'  

Edwards,
who at the time was running the Sneyd Dental Practice in Newcastle-under-Lyme,
Staffordshire, was handed a four-month prison sentence, suspended for two
years, when he appeared in court.

He was suspended for 12 months in
January 2011 after a General Dental Council committee ruled his fitness to
practise was impaired by reason of his conviction.

Lydia Barnfather, for the GDC, had told how Edwards clashed
with Mr Finney during the morning rush hour on November 30, 2009, in Festival
Park, Cobridge, Stoke.

Mr Finney, a cleaning contractor, was at
the wheel of his red van when Edwards suddenly pulled out causing him to slam
on the brakes.

Further down the road, Edwards' BMW ended up getting
blocked by Mr Finney, who got out of his van 'to explain', said the solicitor.

Ms Barnfather said: 'Mr Edwards got out of
his vehicle and walked back to Mr Finney.

'In an appalling and terrifying moment of
loss of self-control, Mr Edwards attacked him.

'His recollection was there was a headbutt
and a punch.

'He describes a punch with his right fist
to the bottom of his left side jaw.

'He felt his nose bleeding and put a hanky
to his nose.'

Edwards, a dentist and former Army major, choked back tears as he described the road rage incident in Newcastle-under-Lyme (above) as a 'terrible error'

The victim exclaimed: 'Are you crazy?' and the dentist replied:
'If you knew who I am, what I've done and what I've been through, you wouldn't
tangle with me.' 

Edwards was interviewed by police three days later, when he
claimed he was defending himself against Mr Finney and only went for him with a
'girlish swing'.

'At this stage I think he is going to
assault me, or trying and assault me again,' he said.

'I put my head down and
swung at him in a non-accurate manner.'

Edwards admitted inflicting grievous
bodily harm at Stoke-On-Trent Crown Court on May 26, 2010.

In addition to
the suspended sentence, he was ordered to pay Mr Finney £7,474
compensation, plus £1,200 court costs. 

He was also ordered to complete
220 hours of unpaid work.

The married father-of-two, who grew up in
Cannock, Staffordshire, and qualified in Liverpool, choked back tears as he described
the affair as a 'terrible error'.

At the initial hearing, he said: 'I
totally overreacted.

'The shame I've brought on myself, the
practice, the profession, the remorse is almost overwhelming at times.

'I'd like to apologise to Mr Finney if he
was here.

'If I can offer reassurance that it won't
happen again, I'd like to do so now.

'It is a very, very painful experience. I
would not like to be here again.'
