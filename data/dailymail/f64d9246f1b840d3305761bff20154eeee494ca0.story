It's only been two months since Rory McIlroy broke off his engagement to Caroline Wozniacki, but it looks like the tennis pro is quickly getting over it.

The 24-year-old Danish beauty, who was planning to walk down the aisle with the Northern Irish golfer in November, will instead be running the New York City Marathon on November 2.

This morning, she tweeted a picture of herself trying on a bright pink pair of running shoes. 'It's on! No turning back now!!' she captioned it. 'Getting ready to run @nycmarathon. Thanks for the prep @adidasrunning #boostnyc'.

Change of plans! Caroline Wozniacki, who was planning to walk down the aisle with golfer Rory McIlroy in November, has revealed she will instead be running the New York City Marathon on November 2

The annual race courses through all five boroughs of the city, and Caroline will run as an ambassador for Team for Kids along with the reigning Boston Marathon champion Meb Keflezighi.

'When I cross the finish line in Central Park, it will be one of the most rewarding days of my life,' the athlete, who is currently ranked 13th in the world in women's tennis, said in a statement.

'Not only because of the personal accomplishment, but also because it will help thousands of kids to get healthy and fit through sports.'

In another sign that she has been getting over her ex, the tennis star was pictured walking into the CBS studios in New York today wearing towering bright blue high heel stilettos.

She paired the eye-catching shoes with a matching purse and a turquoise patterned dress that showed off her athletic physique.

The 5ft 10in blonde was famously taller than her 5ft 8in golfer beau, which made heels problematic.

She seemed to take a swipe at Rory in a similar way earlier this month when she posted a picture of herself shopping with a friend in Istanbul wearing a pair of heels.

She captioned the photo: 'It's been three
 years since I have worn high heels on a normal day out. #feelsgood 
#looksgood #shopping #highheels #sun.'

'That's a great way to say that Rory was a short man,' commented one of her followers. 'You're doing fine. Live it up!' said another.

Caroline and Rory, 25, dated from 2011 until 2014. The couple got engaged on New Year's Eve 2013 in Sydney, but on May 21 it was announced that he had called off the engagement - just days after they sent out invitations.

'The problem is mine,' he said at the time. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had,' he added.

Just eight weeks later, the golfer was spotted with a new rumored love interest, 23-year-old receptionist Sasha Gale. He has also been linked to Irish lingerie model Nadia Forde, 25.
