A former Countryfile presenter who claimed to have been told she was not 'young or pretty' enough for prime time television is in line for a return to the show.

Charlotte Smith was one of four women on the programme aged in their 40s and 50s who were controversially axed in 2009, leading to claims of ageism.

But she is now set for a return to the rural affairs series next month after an absence of five years.

Smith's colleague Miriam O'Reilly, another of the presenters who was dropped, went on to win a landmark employment tribunal ruling against the BBC which decided she had been ditched because of her age.  

Also dropped at the same time were Michaela Strachan and Juliet Morris before the show was relaunched with new presenters.

Smith, currently a presenter on BBC Radio 4's Farming Today said in evidence during O'Reilly's tribunal: 'I was told by a member of the team that I would not be able to pass the primetime test because I was not young or pretty.'

But the 49-year-old will be the first of the four women to return to the Sunday night programme next month.  

The BBC said she will stand in for the programme's investigative reporter Tom Heap while he is on holiday.

It is understood that there is then an option of her making further appearances on the show.

Countryfile, currently presented by Matt Baker, has become one of BBC1's most popular shows since it moved to a new Sunday evening slot.

She confirmed her comeback on Twitter when she told followers: 'I've been presenting for Countryfile today.'

She included a picture of herself in wellies, a lab coat and blue hair net and joked: 'TV just as glamorous as I remember.'

A BBC spokesperson confirmed that Smith is covering for Tom Heap while he is away.
