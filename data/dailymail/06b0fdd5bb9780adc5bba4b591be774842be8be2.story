Dressed in traditional Baianas women perform the 'Lavagem' or washing ritual that will bring luck to the centrepiece of Rio de Janeiro's Carnival celebrations, the Sambadrome, ahead of the festival's official launch on Friday.

The countdown to this annual feast of music and colour is continuing apace in spite of the odds being stacked against it by financial strife in the country, water shortages caused by drought and the flow-on effect of a corruption scandal within the state oil company Petrobras.

While official parades in Sao Paulo have survived the axe after intense contemplation by officials, the main event in the capital Brasilia has had to be cancelled.

Despite financial strife in the country, revellers have already begun festivities with parades such as Sunday's 'Gigantes da Lira' in Rio

Perhpas the most famous city for Carnival, Rio, is of course set to go ahead, thanks in part to its popularity with both locals and tourists.

An estimated 75,000 local and foreign spectators pack into the Sambadrome to take part in the spectacular ceremony that kicks off the five-day celebrations. 

Meanwhile other events have been scaled back as sponsors watch their pennies. Most hit have been the blocos, independently organised parties on favela streets, beaches and other venues in cities across the country as they rely heavily on outside funding.

Bloco Cru, an event that usually attracts 50,000 revellers, is one of the blocos that won't take place this year after the usual backer Lu Baratz admitted she couldn't fund it this year. 

'We didn't achieve sufficient sponsorship to guarantee the party's infrastructure,' she told the O Globo newspaper. 'It is important that the sponsors and council do more than pay for chemical toilets, they need to support the local spirit of carnival.'

Still, more than 900,000 visitors are expected in Rio for the official opening parade on Friday and already rehearsals and preliminary parades have shown markers for what the festival is famous for.

Practice runs at the Sambodrome on Sunday, less than a week before the festival begins, gave a glimpse of the full-scale extravaganzas that can be expected during the festival's actual dates from Friday until Wednesday, February 18.

Also on Sunday the colourful Gigantes da Lira carnival parade, one of the most popular blocos for children took place in  Rio with a sea of clowns and other fun costumes packing the streets.

More colourful characters could be found at the annual block party known as the 'Suvaco do Cristo', which translates in English to 'Armpit of Christ', while the 'Cordao do Boitata' had a tapestry all of its own.

In a sign of the tough times face by Brazil, the nation's main broadcaster TV Globo has decided it's not financially viable to take on the extensive costs of broadcasting the final Parade of Champions this year in a series of cutbacks to its usual coverage of Carnival.

This year's event comes after a World Cup at which Germany left the victors but the value to the host nation is said to have been minimal.

It also comes as the country prepares the other biggest sporting event in the world, the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
