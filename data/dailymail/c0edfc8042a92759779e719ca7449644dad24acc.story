For New Yorkers, the grueling search for affordable apartments is about to get a little easier.

The city is planning to build more 'micro-apartments' - economically-friendly spaces that average 400 square feet - the New York Observer reports.

'We are considering RFPs for two or three micro-unit developments later this year,' a housing official told the Observer. 'We’re in the process of vetting a number of 
city-owned sites, and RFP guidelines will be tailored to the chosen 
sites.'

Big Apple living: New York City is planning to build more micro-apartments like the one pictured here. This particular design is being used for a 55-unit block being built in Manhattan

At close quarters: The innovative apartment design, which was chosen by Mayor Bloomberg, is aimed at addressing the city's shortfall in affordable housing which currently stands at 800,000

Transformation: The floor plans show how one of the units can be adapted from a living room to a bedroom

The news comes several months after city officials announced plans to build 55 new units of micro-apartments on the East side.

Those units are planned for East 27th
 Street in Manhattan - with 40 per cent of homes available to low and 
middle-income New Yorkers. The first residents are expected to move in 
September 2015.

The 
project, which was viewed by Mayor Bloomberg in January, will be the first 
apartment building in New York where units are constructed off-site and 
then fitted together.

The design team behind the project aimed to capitalize on the sense of 'openness' in the tiny units.

The new homes are all between 250 to 370 square feet and have ceiling heights of around 9ft.

Each unit has an open-plan living space with kitchen, a separate bathroom, balcony and long storage area packed in close to the ceiling.

Just like Lego: An artist's impression shows how the prefabricated units, which will be made in Brooklyn Navy Yard, will be fitted together at the site

Who lives in a house like this? Mayor Bloomberg surveys the tiny apartment to be built at a city-owned site at 335 East 27th Street

Streamlined: The design allows single New Yorkers on limited incomes to live in spaces of under 400ft uin the prefabricated units

Modern living: The design was a joint collaboration by Monadnock Development LLC, Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation and nARCHITECTS

The apartments were designed with a pull-out pantry, fridge, range and fold-down bed.

The new homes will be at 335 East 27th Street in mid-town
 Manhattan close to the East River.  The building will have rehearsal 
spaces on the ground floor, lecture halls and a cafe. 

An attic garden and ground-level picnic area have also been planned along with a laundry room, bike room and gym.

Mayor Bloomberg said of the units: 'New
 York’s ability to adapt with changing times is what made us the world’s
 greatest city – and it’s going to be what keeps us strong in the 21st 
Century.

'The growth rate for one- and 
two-person households greatly exceeds that of households with three or 
more people, and addressing that housing challenge requires us to think 
creatively and beyond our current regulations.'

The current housing codes do not allow for an entire building of micro-apartments in NYC - despite the number of one and two-person households accelerating at the fastest rate.

Neat design: Mayor Bloomberg surveys the living space of the new apartment design which will be part of a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York

On board: Bloomberg tries the foldaway bed at the apartment which he backed as part of New York's way of adapting for the future

Inspired: The collaborative design is fitted together from different components to make it easier to live in a compact space

City of the future: The building is in mid-town Manhattan close to the East River

Communal living: The apartment complex will also have an attic garden, gym and ground-floor rehearsal spaces and picnic tables

At present 1.8 million people in New York live alone or with one another - yet there are only one million studios and one-bed apartments in the five boroughs. 

The design was a joint collaboration by Monadnock Development LLC, Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation and nARCHITECTS. They will be built by Capsys at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

The winning design along with four runners-up will be part of an upcoming exhibition at the Museum 
of the City of New York.
