Sam Burgess made a 17-minute cameo off the bench last Friday on his Premiership debut for Bath - and now the rugby league convert is preparing for his first taste of European Rugby Champions Cup action.

Bath travel to France to face Montpellier on Friday night, with Burgess hoping to be involved in the matchday squad.

Having appeared as an inside centre off the bench during the victory over Harlequins, he could be fast-tracked into the starting line-up.

The 25-year-old former South Sydney Rabbitohs star is more likely to be included on the bench again though as he gets used to union.

During training at Bath's Farleigh House complex on Tuesday, Burgess was seen practising receiving high balls and also passing drills. 

Bath are currently second in the Premiership but their continental campaign has not quite gone according to plan so far.

They sit bottom of Pool 4 having lost to both Toulouse and Glasgow.

An inability to convert domestic form into Europe has been a large part of Bath's downfall this year and they will hope to bounce back with a victory in France.

Montpellier are tough opponents, however, and sit eighth in the Top 14, having won half of their 12 domestic games this season.

Bath will have to be at their very best to leave the Altrad Stadium with a victory - and Burgess will need to impress if he gets on to the pitch.
