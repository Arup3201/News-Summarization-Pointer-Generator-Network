The FBI is asking for help identifying an American fanatic fighting for ISIS in Syria.

The unknown man, who has appeared in a propaganda video released by the terror group, is believed to be from the United States because of his pronounced American accent.

And the Bureau hopes that somebody watching the video may recognize the terrorist.

Familiar? The FBI is asking Americans to watch an ISIS terror video in the hope that they can identify this man, thought to be an American

Agents uploaded their own cut of the video, which skips the graphic and violent portions of the 55-minute original, entitled The Flames of War.

But it does show the American figure, wearing a black mask and combat fatigues, boasting over captives whom he says are being forced to dig their own graves. ISIS's black flag billows in the background.

The scene then cuts to a different scene, where a row of prisoners kneel as the American-voiced figure boasts of the Islamic State's treatment of 'kuffar' - a derogatory term for non-Muslims.

The video fades away as the figure turns, gun in hand, towards the waiting men. 

Wanted: The Bureau has set up a phone line and a website, hoping to receive tips over his identity

A statement from the FBI said: 'In releasing a segment from the video, the FBI hopes someone might recognize the man through his voice and appearance.

'In the segment, the faces of purported prisoners are obscured and their executions are not shown.

Michael Steinbach, of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division, said: 'We’re hoping that someone might recognize this individual and provide us with key pieces of information. No piece of information is too small.'

Discussing the videos, the director of the Bureau, James Comey, said they appeal to 'troubled souls' and give them the push they need to 'emerge from the basement' as full-fledged jihadists.

Brutal: In the FBI cut of the video, an excerpt of the much Flames of War film, the American-voiced man stands over captured Syrian soldiers, and gestures at them with his gun. It doesn't show their execution

He said: 'These homegrown violent extremists are troubled souls who are seeking meaning in some misguided way. 

'And so they come across the propaganda and they become radicalized on their own independent study, and they're also able to equip themselves with training again on the Internet, and then engage in jihad after emerging from their basement.'

The FBI is also urging people to report anybody they know who has traveled - or might want to travel - to Iraq and Syria to fight.

Steinbach said the agency 'need' help from the American public to identify any would-be jihadists - and have set up a phone line and web page for any tip-offs.

Suspect: These pictures are believed to be that of Mohammed Hamzah Khan, a 19-year-old from Illinois who was arrested on Saturday allegedly trying to join ISIS

The U.S. government has estimated that more than 100 Americans have left the country to fight with ISIS, some of whom have now come back.

Intelligence officials are said to have confirmed the identities of a dozen Americans on the ground on the side of ISIS.

On Saturday the FBI arrested Mohammed Hamzah Khan at O'Hare airport, Chicago, as he tried to fly to Turkey.

The 19-year-old, from nearby Bolingbrook, Illinois, is accused of attempting to travel overseas to support terrorism - which carries a maximum sentence of 15-years.

Khan is also charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

He reportedly told FBI agents how he hoped to join ISIS - and investigators who scoured his home found documents outlining his intentions, including a letter asking his parents to join him.

Americans? Around 100 U.S. citizens are thought to have left the country for Syria - and some have returned

Other Americans have made similar attempts. Twenty-year-old Adam 'Fadi Fadi' Dandach was arrested by FBI in Los Angeles in July, and confessed he was headed to Syria to join up with ISIS.

The next month investigators took in Donald Ray Morgan, 44, of North Carolina over firearms violations, NBC reports.

But the agency then discovered pro-ISIS messages on his social media accounts, including an image of him swearing fealty to ISIS's ruler, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

A Colorado woman, Shannon Maureen Conley, has pleaded guilty in court to charges that she tried to fly to Turkey to become involved with ISIS.

One man who made it was Douglas McAuthur McCain, 33, of Minnesota.

According to the New York Times, he was fighting on the front lines in August when he was killed by a rival Syrian group. 

FBI sources told the paper that American jihadists tend to be younger than those from elsewhere, often in their teens or early twenties.
