One of the UK's 'most talented musicians': Christian Flagg, pictured, died after he was swept away in the Rhine by Koln-Rodenkirchen during a race when the riverbed dropped sharply

A British rock musician has drowned whilst swimming in Germany.

Bass player Christian Fagg, 23, was swept away by strong currents as he raced friends in the Rhine, near Cologne.

His body was recovered four miles downstream after the accident on Monday.

Tragic Christian, of Cleethorpes, North East Lincolnshire, played bass guitar with the heavy rock group Trollkraft.

A message on the band's website said: 'For those who still haven't heard, our bassist, long standing friend and an all round good bloke, Christian has passed away in a tragic accident.

'Our thoughts go out to his family, brother Kurtis, to Rachel [his girlfriend] and his friends.

'Thanks to all those who made the Thulsa Doom tour a wild week to remember. You've given us all some great stories and memories to remember him by.

'His fellow band members don't want anyone to mourn in silence, feel free to message us, share his pictures and listen to music as loud as you can.

'We're all in the process of coming back together for a drink. Grimsby folks; we'll be around in the coming weeks to catch up and share the good times.

'We're unsure as to where Trollkraft will be going from here. But please, smash a tune on and crack open a beer for my friend, and one of the UK's brightest musicians. Peace, man.

'The world just got a little quieter.'

German authorities today confirmed Christian had died after residents of a German house-boat spotted his body in the water and alerted the local fire brigade.

He was found four miles from where a friend saw him swept away in Koln-Rodenkirchen, near Cologne, when the riverbed dropped sharply during a race in the shallows, exposing him to the strong currents.

Christian had been on holiday with six friends - two women and four men.

His girlfriend Rachel Muir said: 'Crying is good! I always expected this sort of thing to happen to me. Back in the day this would have happened to most people.

'Glad I have no children and that Fagg and I had no unresolved issues, few future plans and knew how we felt about each other. It could be a lot worse but he will be sorely missed.'
