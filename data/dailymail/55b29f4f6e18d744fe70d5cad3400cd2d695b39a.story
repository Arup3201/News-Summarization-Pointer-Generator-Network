Christina Regusters, 21, is on trial on charges of kidnapping, aggravated assault and rape

A 19-year-old daycare worker accused of abducting a five-year-old girl from school by posing as her burkha-clad mother, raping her and leaving her half naked in a playground has been charged.

Christina Regusters, from Philadelphia, was indicted yesterday on charges of aggravated assault, kidnapping, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and several other offenses in the January incident.

Police say Regusters covered herself in a black Muslim burkha, similar to one the girl’s mother wears, when she pulled the child from her  classroom and walked her to a nearby home where she was sexually assaulted.

The 19-year-old worked at an after-school care program the girl attended.

The five-year-old was discovered shivering 
half-naked on a playground about a mile from the school the morning 
after her abduction on January 14.

The
 girl told a passerby, 'I've been stolen' and repeatedly spoke of a 
talking bird inside the home that would 'peck her eyes out' if she 
didn't stay hiding under a bed, philly.com reports.

That talking bird proved crucial in police’s investigation, said Attorney Tom Kline who's representing the girl and her mother.

Regusters,
 who told the child her name was Tiffany, was one of four residents 
questioned on about the abduction at the home several blocks from Bryant Elementary
 School in west Philadelphia.

The other three were later released.

The 5-year-old victim was signed out at this Philadelphia school by a woman claiming to be her mother. She was missing for the next 20 hours

After she was taken to the home, the child was blindfolded, told to 
remove her clothes and to put on a black, adult-sized T-shirt.

She was then 
ordered to hide under a bed. DNA on the shirt matched that found in the house, authorities said.

The brave girl was instrumental in helping police find out where she was held captive, retracing her steps and leading police to the home with the bird.

'This brave, innocent precious little
 girl was instrumental in leading police literally to the door of the 
crime,' said Kline at the time.

'She told them that there was a bird in the house. The bird became one of the many focal points of the investigation,' he added.

Kline
 said the girl suffered 'terrible, horrible injuries' and that the 
family was 'grateful' for the arrest, but knows it isn't the end of the 
line.

The child was discovered the next day, about 4:40am, after a man walking by heard her screams from this playground

Investigators believe after the suspect and victim successfully walked a few blocks to the home a man was waiting.

'There is still more work to be done,' Kline said adding that there were clearly additional people involved. 'We are watching anxiously the next developments because this is not the end of the line.'

Regusters' attorney, W. Fred Harrison Jr., told WCAU-TV Regusters had 'no involvement' in the crime.

Authorities believe she was dumped about 18 hours later at the park before found by a passerby who hear her screaming.

Fear: The child told police that she was taken to a nearby house with a talking bird whose owner said would peck her eyes out if she didn't stay hiding under a bed

The child was hiding under a jungle 
gym play set around 4.40am and it was unclear how long she had been outside. She was 
freezing, as it was about 37 degrees outside and damp from rain the 
night before.

Nelson Mandela Myers who found her that morning said he asked where her parents were.

'She said, "I don't know. Somebody 
was chasing me. I ran",' Myers said. 'She said she came from South 
Philly. I knew something was wrong, because I knew she couldn't have run
 from South Philly.'

'As he
 starts to walk to where the screams are, a little girls runs out,' 
Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told Philly.com. 'She said, "I ran away, I ran away from the people who took me".'

The child was immediately taken to a nearby hospital to get checked out.

News of the girl’s abduction sent waves through both the community and the school where the girl was successfully released to the woman without photo ID shown.

About a week after the principal at the school was removed among four people held responsible for the horrific ordeal.

The girl had been abducted from her school around 8:50am by a woman dressed in a burkha who called herself 'Tiffany'

District officials 
said the incident violated school procedure, which requires anyone 
signing a child out of school to show ID and be on a list of as a 
verified parent or guardian. 

Allowing
 the girl to leave school with an unknown adult was a 'serious break in 
procedure,' District spokesman Fernando Gallard said.

The
 woman didn't wait at the school's front office, as is policy, but went 
to Robinson's classroom and told a teacher that the child had already 
been 'checked out' of school. 

Robinson was not reported as missing until 3pm, when a caretaker from the child's after-school program came to pick her up.

Her mother appeared on local media tearfully pleading for her safe return, and explaining how 
she also wears the traditional chador and niqab - the type of clothing 
that Robinson's abductor was wearing.

The playground where the girl was found is adjacent to a baseball field and a residential neighborhood, where police focused their search for her abductors
