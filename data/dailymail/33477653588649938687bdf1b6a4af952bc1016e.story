Energy drinks are as harmful as drugs and should be banned from schools, according to a government adviser.

Drinks such as Monster, Red Bull and Relentless combine sugar and caffeine in such high quantities that children are becoming hyperactive and difficult to control.

Some 500ml cans contain the equivalent of more than 13 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg of caffeine – which is about the same as in four cans of cola.

Manufacturers and retailers have a 
voluntary ban on the sale of the drinks to under-16s, but there is no 
law to stop children buying them.

Yesterday government adviser John Vincent warned: ‘Energy drinks are effectively another form of drugs.’

Mr
 Vincent, who co-founded the Leon restaurant group, is part of a team 
recruited by the Government to improve the nutrition of meals served to 
youngsters. He said: ‘The amount of sugar and caffeine in these drinks 
is in our view effectively allowing drugs into schools.

‘We
 don’t do that and neither do we think that should be part of school 
life. It has a hugely damaging effect on their ability to concentrate, 
how they feel and it is having health effects.’

X
 Factor judge Sharon Osbourne also said yesterday that she blamed energy
 drinks for a seizure suffered by her daughter Kelly last year. The 
29-year-old spent five days in hospital after having a fit and 
collapsing.

And evidence from teachers and pupils is that children who drink these cans may report feeling sick, shaky and dizzy.

Ian Fenn, headmaster of Burnage Media Arts College in Manchester, has banned the drinks following requests from staff.

He
 told the BBC: ‘Staff came to me and said – at a school where we are 
very conscious about the nutritional value of what they eat – we cannot 
allow boys to bring in drinks that are really unhealthy for them and 
consume not one, but two or three.’

Claire
 Duggan, a schools public health adviser, said some children report 
feeling unwell after downing the drinks. ‘They say the rush that it gave
 them could be quite scary if you drank it very fast,’ she added.

The
 Food Standards Agency advises that children limit their intake of 
drinks that are high in caffeine. A spokesman added that consuming the 
drinks ‘could potentially lead to short-term effects such as increased 
excitability, irritability, nervousness or anxiety’.

Some
 children are even opting to have an energy drink for breakfast rather 
than a bowl of cereal. A survey published in the autumn found that one 
in 20 teenagers goes to school on a can of energy drink.

Brian
 Lightman, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘They
 are in no fit state to be in the classroom. They can be hyperactive, 
and it can have a very negative effect on their behaviour.’

The
 British Soft Drinks Association code of conduct states that energy 
drinks should not be sold in schools. But a Freedom of Information 
request last year found some academies – which have the right to opt out
 of national standards on school food and nutrition – were selling the 
drinks.

An association 
spokesman said: ‘We are clear that energy drinks are not recommended for
 children, and we want to get that message across to young people and 
parents.’
