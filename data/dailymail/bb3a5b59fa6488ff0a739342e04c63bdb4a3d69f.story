This is the shocking moment a pedestrian was nearly crushed by huge chunks of falling ice.

The unnamed man was walking down a street in Syktyvkar, northern Russia, when snow and ice began to plummet from a nearby roof.

As a passerby looked on the man ran forward to get out the way - but ended up having to crawl through the debris clutching his bag to escape.

The terrifying experience was caught on a road traffic camera.  

Police said the man was very lucky.

A spokesman said: 'The man was shaken but not hurt and after clearing off the snow continued with his journey. 

'It illustrates the fact that people should try and walk well out from buildings and watch out for falling snow and ice.'
