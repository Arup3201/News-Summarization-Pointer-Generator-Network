Cara Perrett has many friends in London but her visit to the capital this month will not be easy. ‘I find it difficult coming back now,’ she says. ‘Which is a shame, as I lived there for ten years and have lots of friends whom I miss.’

The source of her fear is not crime or terrorism or crowds, but something that we all take for granted: the pavement beneath our feet.

Two years ago, in May 2012, Mrs Perrett, a barrister, was walking home along the Edgware Road in North-West London when she was engulfed by a fireball erupting from the ground.

‘I was in shock, I was terrified,’ she remembers. ‘The back of my dress and tights were blown off. The tips of my fingers had all but disappeared behind these hard fleshy barnacles that formed at the end of my fingers.’ 

Mrs Perrett suffered severe burns in the explosion, caused by a spark from a faulty electricity cable which then ignited leaking gas.

The physical scars remain to this day, but it is the mental scars that are more troubling – fears of the everyday caused by a sudden, terrifying event in the most mundane of settings.

Pavement explosions, rare and potentially fatal events, are getting less rare. Figures to September show that so far this year, there have been 124 serious manhole fires involving faulty electric cables and junction boxes in Britain, compared to 34 in 2010.

The overwhelming majority - 113 - have occurred in the South East of England, but serious incidents have been recorded over the past few years in Birmingham, Nottingham, Liverpool and, just last month, Aberdeen.

The culprit appears to be the age of the country’s network of underground electricity distribution cables, combined with - or so the half-dozen electricity distribution companies claim - the vagaries of the British weather.

Two very wet winters, it seems, have resulted in water seeping into link (junction) boxes, with delayed but serious consequences.

What the distribution companies are less keen to advertise is a previously haphazard inspection regime that has taken second place to reaping massive profits from their regional monopolies. 

That regime is now coming under close scrutiny, with the Health and Safety Executive warning UK Power Networks (UKPN), which distributes electricity to London and the South East, to improve its safety record.

Mrs Perrett, 34, who now lives in Switzerland, is one of those pushing for better safety standards via an online petition. ‘The psychological injury was much worse,’ she says.

‘I coped well with the aftermath of the explosion and thought I was going to be OK. But ten or so months after the explosion I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and related depression.’

Two other people were injured in the explosion, one woman sustaining injuries even more serious than those of Mrs Perrett.

‘The main problem, apart from the more obvious side-effects, such as being terrified of loud noises and, indeed, any reminders of that day, was an almost crippling sense of guilt,’ she says.

‘It started when the memory came back to me of running past the woman who had been even more seriously injured. In my panic, I thought there had been a terrorist attack and was worried about another bomb, so I ran for my life.

‘Afterwards, I started to question whether I should have stopped to help the other woman, whether I had a right to save myself without giving thought to anyone else.’

Exploding pavements may be a nationwide problem but the risk is greatest by far in London. Sixty-four of the 113 serious incidents in the UKPN area so far this year have occurred in the capital, an average of almost two a week.

In February, some 50 homes in Islington, North London, were evacuated when an electrical fire burst out into a busy shopping area. Then, in July, a lorry was engulfed in flames by a manhole explosion in Piccadilly. Only last month, flames erupted from a manhole cover by commuters on Old Brompton Road, South Kensington.

Colin Wingate was visiting friends in Harrow, North London, in August 2011 when he was thrown off his feet by a manhole explosion.

‘I had one foot on the manhole cover and I was thrown into the air,’ remembers Mr Wingate, who is 76 and lives in Bournemouth. ‘My friend, who was a few feet away, was knocked sideways off his feet.

‘The noise was deafening and I wasn’t sure of what was going on. But I remember being in a huge amount of pain. I had a huge gash in my leg and the tendons all around my knee were severed. 

I later found out that one of the people who had called 999 had told them: “Send everything!” because they thought a bomb had gone off.

‘Sooner or later, there is going to be a serious injury or, God forbid, a death. It’s only a matter of time. It’s as if the threat is not being taken seriously.’

When questioned by a Westminster City Council committee about the increase in explosions in the local authority area, Basil Scarsella, chief executive of UKPN, the man responsible for 22,000 miles of cable in London, claimed it was ‘impossible’ to stop more explosions, pinning much of the blame on wet weather.

Rain has not stopped play when it comes to profits, however. UKPN made close to £1 billion for its Hong Kong-based owners in 2012.

The company was later fined for its slow response to power cuts caused by last winter’s flooding.

‘There is some evidence that the age of the asset is a contributor,’ Mr Scarsella told the council committee. ‘But more important is the increase in the amount of rain.’

Some councillors were unconvinced by Mr Scarsella, who earns £1.7 million a year. They pointed out that the past two summers had been among the driest on record. 

‘It is more by luck than planning that we haven’t had any serious injuries,’ said Ian Adams, chairman of Westminster’s environment committee.

John Steed, a senior officer at the Health and Safety Executive, says he has warned UKPN to improve its act.

‘Earlier this year we twice had directors of UK Power Networks in and said: “Look, we’re not happy about this increase [in manhole incidents], what are you doing about this?”

‘They told us: “We are doing this,” - they thought they were doing enough. And I told them: “No, you’re not doing enough.” ’

Mr Steed agrees water plays a major role in manhole fires, and also points to disruption caused by the digging up of pavements by various bodies.

But he adds: ‘Ageing is very much an issue. Most of the network was laid in the 1950s and 1960s. It is difficult, if not impossible, to look at these link boxes and know exactly what stage they have reached in terms of deterioration. The best solution, probably, is to replace them on a regular basis.’

The Energy Networks Association, the voice of the electricity distribution industry, places part of the blame on increasing amounts of ‘street furniture’ and associated excavations.

‘The cables under the pavement are very robust and hardly ever fail on their own,’ says a spokesman, ‘so the main reasons for these incidents are a combination of external damage by third parties, vandalism and two of the wettest winters on record.’

For its part, UKPN says it is addressing the problem with more frequent, detailed inspections and a rolling programme to replace link boxes.

‘We are investing more than £10 million this year and will spend £80 million over the next eight years to ensure that our safety procedures remain robust,’ says a spokesman. ‘To keep London powered, we have over 100,000 cable boxes and cable pits, as well as 22,000 miles of cables under the streets, and there are relatively few cases where our equipment has faulted.’

Over the last few years, he adds, it has installed thousands of new link boxes, at a cost of almost £40 million. UKPN says it is limited in what it can spend on infrastructure by Ofgem, the Government regulator — said to be anxious to minimise the impact of such spending on electricity bill payers.

But Ofgem is understood to dispute any suggestion that it is preventing UKPN from pursuing its safety programme. ‘We have been and will continue to monitor the faults that UKPN have been experiencing,’ says a spokesman.

All too late for Cara Perrett. UKPN admitted joint liability for her injuries, together with a gas company, and has now settled her claim, the details of which remain confidential.

‘I am not convinced that the industry is taking this problem seriously enough,’ she says. ‘Why can’t they sort it out more quickly? Why can’t they be made to do so? The right to walk safely down our public pavements is surely a fundamental principle of any civilised society.

‘The question has to be asked, are they more concerned about their profits than people’s safety?’
