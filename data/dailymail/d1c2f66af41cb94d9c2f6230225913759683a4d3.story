Congressmen today watched harrowing footage of the U.S. ambassador to Libya being dragged out of the consulate during the terror attack which killed him.

Members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees were shown a video of Chris Stevens being taken out of the building in Benghazi while it was attacked by radical Islamists on September 11.

The lawmakers watched the video during a hearing in which the acting director of the CIA told them that the administration's mistaken statements on the causes of the raid were down to incorrect intelligence information.

Chris Stevens died during the terror attack at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya

In defense: Acting CIA Director Mike Morell said on Thursday that Susan Ric, pictured, e was reading from an unclassified version of what happened in Benghazi that later proved to be wrong

The footage was shown as part of an 
attempt by the CIA to provide the fullest account yet of the deadly 
assault, which left Stevens and three other Americans dead.

It captured some of the last moments 
of the ambassador's life, showing the attack on the consulate building 
as well as Stevens being removed from the building as he suffered from 
the injuries which would eventually kill him.

Senator Dan Coats told CNN the video was 'combination of video from a surveillance camera and a drone'.

He added: 'It gave us a good picture, from the surveillance standpoint, what was happening.'

Due in Washington: Hillary, pictured Thursday in Australia, will testify ihn December before Congress on the Benghazi attack

Testimony: Acting CIA director Mike Morell pictured leaving the Senate hearing on Thursday

Mike Morell, 
 the acting CIA director who took over for disgraced boss David 
Petraeus, told the committees that UN ambassador Susan Rice had been 
provided with an 
unclassified version of what happened during the deadly September attack
 
in Libya that was incorrect.

Emerging from the session, Democratic
 Rep. Adam Schiff said Morell told the panel that Rice was given an 
initial assessment that a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim video 
evolved into an attack on the consulate.

Rice's comments on national talk 
shows five days after the attack has drawn fierce criticism, with some 
Senate Republicans vowing to block her nomination if she is tapped to 
replace Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Schiff said the ambassador's interview remarks were based on the 'best initial assessment.'

Watching the watchers: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, pictured today in Bangkok, Thailand, asked service chiefs to review ethics training for military officers in the wake of the controversy surrounding Petraeus

Meanwhile, Clinton will testify 
before the congressional committee next month on the handling of the 
deadly September 11, attack, which was carried out on the 11th 
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington.

Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chairwoman of the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, said: 'The
 secretary has committed to testifying before our committee... on the 
Accountability Review Board's report, which is expected to be concluded 
by early to mid-December.'

But all eyes will be on Washington tomorrow, as Petraeus himself will testify on the Benghazi attack, appearing in public for the first time since news of the sex scandal broke.

The news came as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta asked service chiefs to review ethics training for military officers in the wake of the controversy surrounding Petraeus, who resigned in disgrace last year after admitting he had an affair with his biographer.

Panetta said he was unaware of any other top brass who could turn out to be ensnared in the debacle.

Involved:
 During the FBI's search, they also discovered 'inappropriate' and 'flirtatious' emails between Jill Kelley and Gen John 
Allen, pictured with his wife Kathy andÂ  daughter Bobbie

The socialite: Jill Kelley is believed to have exchanged flirtatious emails between her and Gen Allen

One person missing from the tableau: 
Afghan war chief Gen John Allen, whose nomination to take over in 
Europe is on hold because of suggestive emails that turned up in the 
investigation of the Petraeus affair.

Allen is under investigation over flirtatious emails he is believed to have exchanged with Jill Kelley, a Florida socialite and friend of Petraeus who has since been thrust right to the middle of the scandal.

Legislators went ahead with a hearing on the nomination of Gen Joseph Dunford to replace Allen in Afghanistan.

But with Allen's own future 
uncertain, they put off consideration of his promotion to U.S. European 
Command chief and NATO supreme allied commander.

Allen had initially been scheduled to testify.

Scandal: Petraeus and Paula Broadwell, pictured, conducted an affair from November 2011 until July 2012 - forcing his resignation when details were made public

Panetta, speaking at a news 
conference in Bangkok, gave new words of support to Allen, voicing 'tremendous confidence' in the general.

Citing a string of ethical lapses by 
senior military officers, however, Panetta asked the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff to review ethics training and look for ways to help officers stay 
out of trouble.

Petraeus said on Thursday that his resignation had nothing to do with what happened in Benghazi, and how he is determined to make his marriage work.

Breaking his silence almost a week after he dramatically stepped down, Petraeus also revealed he has not spoken to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, since the scandal emerged and denied he had ever given her classified military documents.

He maintained that his shock resignation on Friday had nothing to do with hearings about the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, which he was due to testify at this week.

Speaking out: David Petraeus, whose affair with biographer Paula Broadwell led to his resignation last week, has said he is committed to making it work with his wife and acknowledges his mistake

Instead, Petraeus, speaking with HLN reporter Kyra Phillips, said he stepped down as he was deeply remorseful about the affair and the only honorable thing left to do was to admit his failings.

And, relaying her conversations with Petraeus to HLN on

 Thursday, Phillips said he was now focusing on repairing the damage 
inflicted on his family, including his two adult children, Anne and 
Stephen.

He admitted to
 her that he had 'screwed up terribly' and that he 'felt fortunate to 
have a wife who is far better than he deserves,' Phillips said.

'He knows he made a big mistake,' she said. 'He does 
want to move forward making things work with his family. He doesn't want
 to throw 37 years out the window with his wife.'

Family: Petraeus said he hopes he can work things out with his wife Holly, pictured with their children in 2004

Sweethearts: Petraeus on the day he graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1974, with Holly

'This woman is strong,' she added of Holly Petraeus. 'She knows what she wants. She's 
obviously, according to people that know her well, not happy about this 
- very, very upset about this.

'I do not know if she's committed to 
working this out with Petraeus... But I
 do know that Dave Petraeus does not want to throw 37 years away and 
would really like to make this work and make things right with his 
family.'

Petraeus, 60, revealed 
very little about his ten-month affair with Broadwell, 
which ended in July, but said they had not spoken since Friday.

'They have not talked since this story 
broke,' Phillips said. 'They talked a couple of times when he ended this relationship 
which was a couple [of] months ago. But they have not talked since the 
story broke.'

These 
previous conversations have been confirmed by sources who saw Petraeus 
and Broadwell chatting at an intelligence event in Washington on October
 27, weeks after the start of the FBI probe.
