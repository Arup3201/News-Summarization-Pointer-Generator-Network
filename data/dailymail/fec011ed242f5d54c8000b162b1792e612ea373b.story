Graeme Jarman, 47, who was given a life sentence at Newcastle Crown Court today for the murder of 77 year old Judith Richardson

A dangerous criminal who once dubbed himself 'your everyday psychopath' has been jailed for life for bludgeoning a pensioner to death with a hammer.

Graeme Jarman struck Judith Richardson, 77, at least 30 times after forcing his way into her flat in Hexham, Northumberland, posing as a charity worker.

Jarman, who consistently denied murder during his trial at Newcastle Crown Court, fled the scene with Miss Richardson’s handbag, sparking a major manhunt before he was arrested in Filey, North Yorkshire, a fortnight later.

He showed no emotion as the verdict was handed down  by a 11-1 majority after the jury had deliberated for seven hours.

Ordering a minimum term of 35 years, Judge Mr Justice Openshaw said the defendant clearly 'presents an extreme danger to women' and may never be released from jail.

He added that Jarman 'has shown not the slightest regret or remorse' after taking the life of 'an entirely decent, respectful member of the community.

'That he will be detained until he is an old man is a price he must pay for committing such a terrible crime.'

Jarman, 48, tricked the spinster into opening her front door by showing her Age UK charity leaflets and immediately began battering her.

Her ground floor flat was ransacked and her jewellery stolen as she lay dying in her hallway. She was brutally beaten for a second time as the killer left.

During the trial, which lasted almost three weeks, Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said the horrific attack was not random and that Jarman had been following potential victims the day before.

What the jury did not know is that Jarman had already been convicted of locking a teenage girl in his car boot and raping her at gunpoint.

During the seven-hour ordeal he told her: 'I am your everyday psychopath.'

A few years later, he barged into a 23-year-old woman’s home, tied her up and sexually abused her.

He robbed that victim too, before 
going on the run, just as he did after murdering Miss Richardson, 
changing his appearance as he went.

The
court was shown CCTV of Jarman in Hexham the day before the pensioner’s
death last August, which showed him talking to elderly residents.

Mr Smith said Jarman was 'observing potential victims'.

On the day of the murder, Jarman went to Miss Richardson’s home with the charity leaflets and a hammer he had stolen from a shop in Hexham.

Miss Richardson, who lived with her terrier Hamish, was settling down to her lunch of buttered toast.

He struck her with the hammer straight after she answered the door and she fell against the wall of the lobby, bleeding from her initial head wound or wounds.

Jarman searched her bedroom for items to steal as she lay injured but still alive.

She managed to crawl a few metres along the hallway before Jarman struck again more than 30 times.

He fled, taking a number of buses to different towns where he bought clothes and shaved his head.

He arrived in Newcastle and threw her handbag in a bin before selling her jewellery for £300 at scrap value.

A member of the public found her bag, alerted police and officers responding to a simple lost property case were met by a bloody scene.

Jarman was finally arrested after the case received national publicity.

By then, his DNA had been found on tissues at Miss Richardson’s home. The tissues also had traces of her blood. Jarman’s fingerprints were also found on the charity leaflets.

Jarman denied the offence, claiming he took her handbag which had been left outside her home by the real killer.

One of the most startling aspects of 
the case is Jarman's background. A married former civil servant, those who knew 
him described him as well-educated, articulate and sociable.

But his outward demeanour hid a terrible catalogue of depravities, 
including gunpoint rape, torture, kidnap, armed robbery and indecent 
assault.

After he went on the run following Judith Richardson's murder last 
August, the police - who suspected he was responsible - warned the 
public that his air of normality made him deceptively dangerous.

Jarman had previously served long 
prison sentences for some of society’s most serious crimes, but 
repeatedly convinced parole boards he was rehabilitated and fit for 
release.

He was jailed for seven years for his
attack on the 23-year-old, but served just three before he was released
in 1991 and married his long-term girlfriend, Tracey.

But months later he went missing.

On June 7, 1992, in an incident that 
bears striking similarities to the murder of Judith Richardson, he 
tricked his way the home of a young woman in St-Annes-on-Sea in 
Lancashire.

Having compiled a 'robbery kit' 
containing a knife, rope, tape and gloves, he bound and gagged the 
23-year-old and robbed and sexually assaulted her.

The prime suspect, Jarman went on the
run only to be caught seven weeks later in the south coast seaside 
resort of Hastings and jailed for 15 years.

He was released after 10, moving to Oxford in 2002 where he slept rough.

While on licence, he held a knife to a woman and stole her car, earning him another eight years behind bars in 2003.

He was last freed in 2008 after serving just five years and went to live in Stockton, Teesside, before moving north to Consett in County Durham, where police checked on him with monthly visits due to his history of offending.

But he last spoke to his family on August 17 last year, then failed to appear at Consett Magistrates’ Court to face a petty shoplifting charge on August 23.

Miss Richardson was bludgeoned to death on August 19 in her flat, which was peppered with Jarman’s DNA, prompting a major manhunt involving three northern police forces and 80 detectives.Uniformed officers across Britain were also put on alert and ports and airports were briefed.

Police hoped his fragile emotional attachment to his mother Irene, then 71, would be the key to snaring the suspected killer.

In a candid appeal, she told her son through the media: 'Graeme, you need to hand yourself in at the nearest police station. It’s the best thing you can do. You’ve handed yourself in before and you can do it again.'

Jarman did not hand himself in but was arrested following a tip-off by library staff in another seaside resort - Filey in North Yorkshire - a fortnight after he bolted.
