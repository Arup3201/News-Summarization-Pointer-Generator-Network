Olympic hero Sir Bradley Wiggins has apologised today after a lewd joke about a sex act fell flat at a £300-a-head charity event to support child abuse victims.

The cycling great was heard asking the compere to 's*** me off' because he had a 'posh voice' but diners at the Barnado's children's charity event in Harrogate were 'stunned into silence'.

Alcohol had been running 'extremely freely' at the exclusive Rudding Park Hotel in North Yorkshire, but MailOnline understands that Sir Bradley, who was there with his wife Catherine, was not drunk.

Off comment: Sir Bradley Wiggins with his wife Catherine (pictured last year) were at the event earlier this month where the cycling star made a rude joke that shocked diners

Wiggins had donated a signed shirt to raise money and as his face appeared on a big screen he was heard saying to Jon Hammond, the auctioneer, 'You’ve got a 
posh voice. I like posh voices. S*** me off', according to the Daily Star.

His shirt still made around £5,000 for charity.

Today Sir Bradley's representatives apologised to anyone 
offended by the joke, and said the knight had been enjoying 'banter' but was then 'caught unawares'.

Guests at the Firecracker Ball event admitted they felt let down by what happened.

Star: Sir Bradley after taking gold at the Men's time trial at London 2012, in a summer where he also won the Tour de France

'Initially there was just stunned silence. It was bizarre and shocking,' businessman David Parkin told the Star.

'The chap sitting next to me said: ‘Before tonight he was my hero, but not any more.

'It was completely the wrong time and place to say something like that. People were completely disgusted by him.'

Retired PR manager Malcolm Cowing added: 'Bradley’s remarks were at very best completely misjudged. On a stag do maybe, but not at a dinner for victims of childhood sexual abuse.'

Great: Sir Bradley is one of Britain's greatest sportsman, but also has a reputation as a badboy, pictured here drinking at the London 2012 velodrome

Cycling’s ‘Modfather’ was taken to people’s hearts last year when he pulled off the minor miracle of becoming the first Briton to win the Tour de France — before  winning the Olympic time trial and celebrating with a Churchill victory sign as he sat on the gaudy throne, providing one of London 2012’s imperishable memories.

He won BBC Sports Personality of the Year by a mile after amusing Sue Barker by calling her ‘Susan’ in mock seriousness and was then awarded a knighthood to wide public acclaim.

But a year on he has suffered, failing to compete in the Tour de France after a row with rival Chris Froome over who would lead Team Sky.

After Froome won, Wiggins apparently did not phone to congratulate the new champion.

Wiggins is also becoming known as the badboy of British sport, sometimes seen swearing at photographers, stumbling out of nightclubs drunk or having a cheeky cigarette.

Last night Sir Bradley's spokesman said: 'There had been some friendly banter beforehand and Bradley was caught unawares by the auctioneer. We'd like to apologise to anyone who was offended by his language'.
