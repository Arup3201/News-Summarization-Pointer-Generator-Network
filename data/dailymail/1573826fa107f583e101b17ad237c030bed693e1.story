Tory Cabinet ministers are split over whether the party should pledge to limit child benefit to the first two children, it emerged last night.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith gave his public backing to the idea yesterday, saying it would encourage ‘responsibility’ by parents.

Mr Duncan Smith, a long-time enthusiast for the plan, has drawn up private costings suggesting the move could cut £2 billion a year off the benefits bill if it is applied to all future families.

Backs the bill: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith gave his public backing to the idea of limiting child benefit to the first two children

He has spent months behind the scenes pushing for the policy to be included in the Conservative Party manifesto, arguing it could play a major role in meeting a commitment to cut the benefits bill by £12 billion.

But other ministers are nervous that the move could alienate working families on low incomes – and draw unflattering comparisons with China’s controversial ‘one child policy’.

A Tory source said the Chancellor George Osborne is among those who are ‘worried about the politics’ of the plan.

Mr Duncan Smith yesterday suggested the policy could be limited to families on benefits – reducing the potential controversy, but also slashing the amount it would save.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘This is not a policy of the present government - if we do go down that road we will announce that. 

Pledge: Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show 'this is not about trying to penalise people'

'All I would say is this - people out there who are working, they make decisions about the size of their house, about how many children they have in accordance with what they can afford, we all do that, that’s how we work.

‘We haven’t made any announcement. All I’m saying to you is the principle that lies behind all these changes is this - you want people who are on benefit to take as much responsibility for their lives as people who are in work, that way it’s easier for them when they go to work to deal with their bills and their debts, etc. This is not about trying to penalise people.’

Large existing families would not be penalised by the Tory proposals, as they would only apply to children born in the future.

The cap would mean that a family having more than two children would lose almost £700 per child per year.

Against idea: Tory ministers originally considered capping child benefit at two children in 2012. But the plan was vetoed by Nick Clegg

Those pushed over the limit by multiple births would be exempt. The plan would also not affect those earning more than £50,000 a year, who have already had their child benefit cut.

Downing Street declined to comment on the issue last night, saying it was ‘not policy at the moment’.

Senior Tories are still debating whether new curbs on child benefit should be included in the manifesto – and whether they should apply only to those on benefits.

Tory ministers originally considered capping child benefit at two children in 2012. But the plan was vetoed by Nick Clegg.

Nadhim Zahawi, a member of the Number 10 policy board, was slapped down by Mr Cameron the following year for reviving the plan and suggesting it should be applied to all families, including those not on benefits.

But the need to find £12billion savings from the benefits bill has led to a reappraisal of the scheme.

One Tory enthusiast for the idea, said: ‘This is an idea that saves a lot of money – something like £2billion a year. 

'And it’s a good one because it’s not about squeezing or freezing existing benefits. Instead, it’s a principle-based policy that just says we should all face the same choices about how many children we can afford to support.

‘People can’t expect the taxpayer to fund lifestyle choices they can’t afford.’

The idea of capping child benefit payments has been condemned by anti-poverty charities. Oxfam UK has warned it would have a ‘devastating effect on those already struggling to make ends meet’.
