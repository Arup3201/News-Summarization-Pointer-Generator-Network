Police in Cleveland, Texas are investigating the horrifying possibility that another gang rape has occurred in the small town of 8,000, just three years after an assault by 20 men on an 11-year-old girl shocked the nation.

The latest crime involves a 15-year-old girl who has told Cleveland police that she was drugged, attacked and raped by four men in an abandoned home over the weekend before last.

The girl's parents made the complaint to law enforcement on Tuesday and the girl was taken to a Houston medical facility to be examined by rape experts before she was interviewed in a secure environment at a child advocacy center.

Horror: This is the abandoned home where the 15-year-old girl alleges that she was raped by as many as four men in late September

'Right now it’s just an alleged rape. We are running down all the leads,' said Cleveland Police Chief Darrel Broussard to the Cleveland Advocate.

'It's sad,' said a mother who didn't want to be identified to KHOU.Com 'We have too many kids getting hurt in Cleveland.'

At this point, there are no charges and no one has been arrested - but the case has reopened the wounds of three years ago - when twenty men and boys were charged with raping an 11-year-old.

All of them have either accepted plea deals or were convicted.

Police say the girl was raped repeatedly between September 15, 2010 and December 3 of that year by a gang of 20 boys aged between 14 and 27.

The victim has admitted to being a a consenting participant in the encounters and has acknowledged that she never made an outcry until she was questioned by authorities once sex tapes filmed by the boys surfaced at Cleveland High School.

Prosecutors argue, however, that an 11-year-old's consent is meaningless because she is not emotionally mature enough to understand what she is doing.

When the case surfaced three years ago, the father of the girl said he discovered the abuse in November 2010 after being sent sexually explicit pictures of his daughter on his cell phone.

Speaking to the New York Times, the victim's father said he had been worried about his daughter for 'months', as she had been climbing out of her bedroom window at night, coming home as late as 12 p.m.

One night, she returned home at 3 a.m. shaking and crying. The girl told her parents she had been visiting 'friends.'

He said: 'Her mind is a child’s mind. That’s what makes me so angry.

'She will never recover from this.'

He told the paper that although she was tall for her age, the girl remained a child; her bed piled high with stuffed animals.

Several of the suspects have serious criminal records while others have children of their own, including one nicknamed 'Mookey', who was ordered to pay child support for five children within the past year.

Among those accused are two sets of siblings, Xavier Montreal King and his older brother Kelvin.Xavier, nicknamed 'Youngmoney', has just become a father with his 15-year-old partner Markeya Mallet.

Police became aware of the alleged rape after the girl told a school district police chief about the incident on December 3, 2010.

One school employee spoke with several students: 'Who had seen the cell phone videos or heard of the incident,' the affidavit said.

The victim was then interviewed at a child advocacy center.

According to documents, one of the suspects called her, 'and asked if she wanted to ride around,' the warrant said. Three of the suspects then picked her up and took her to one residence where a fourth suspect lived.

A fourth suspect told the young girl to disrobe, she said, adding that she would be 'beaten up if she did not comply,' an affidavit recorded.

The girl was then said to have engaged in sexual acts in the bedroom and bathroom of the house.While in the bathroom, the girl said she heard one suspect calling and inviting other people to have sex with her.

After she left the bathroom, she saw four men she did not know, the affidavit said.

The party was disturbed, however, when the aunt of one of the suspects returned home.

The alleged victim and the men then 'left the residence in haste through the rear window of the house,' the affidavit said.

The group then moved to an abandoned trailer where the sexual acts continued.

The alleged victim 'stated that digital still images and digital video images of the sex acts were recorded by one or more individuals using cellular telephones.'

The incident raised racial tensions in the 8,000-strong community of Celveland, Texas, as the suspects are all black and the girl is of Mexican descent.

Latino community leaders defended the young girl, saying people who have questioned her parental supervision and dress are re-victimizing her.
