The Massachusetts State Police photographer who leaked a series of previously unseen photos of the arrested of suspected Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces being suspended from his job next week while an internal investigation into his unauthorized actions is carried out.

Sgt. Sean Murphy said he was so incensed by what he saw as the glamorization of Tsarnaev by Rolling Stone magazine, that he made public for the first time on Thursday a series of photos documenting Tsarnaev’s capture in Watertown, Mass.

The images, which Murphy handed over to Boston Magazine, show the alleged bomber bruised and bloodied with his hands in the air as he emerges from his final hiding place.

'I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets,' wrote Murphy in a posting on the magazine’s website.

'This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show.'

Murphy has been labeled a 'hero' for his actions by many with popular option - especially in Boston - that he did the right thing to counter act the cover of the current issue of Rolling Stone which was widely perceived to have 'glamorized' Tsarnaev.

Murphy's actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, more than 10,000 people have 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page and supporters have also taken to Twitter to call him a hero.

Federal prosecutors however were quick to voice their displeasure at Murphy’s actions.

'The release of these photos was completely unacceptable,'
said a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz, whose prosecutors
are preparing a case against Tsarnaev on 30 federal charges, 17 of them
capital offenses.

'We have spoken with the Massachusetts State Police, who have assured us that the release of the photos was unauthorized and that they are taking action internally in response.'

It is unclear whether the photos could damage the federal case against the man accused of setting off pressure cooker bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260.

Murphy accompanied the Swat teams as 
they descended on a boat in the backyard of a Watertown home, where 
Tsarnaev sought refuge following one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. 
history.

Within hours of releasing the photos, Murphy was relieved of his duties for a day.

A hearing is expected next week to 
determine whether Murphy will be formally suspended while the internal 
investigation is conducted, Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio told the L.A. Times.

Murphy, who has worked in law enforcement for 25 years, has been ordered by his bosses to refrain from speaking to the media.

The Rolling Stone cover story on Tsarnaev was released online this week, a few days after his public court appearance.

Critics blasted the magazine, saying the cover shot of Tsarnaev was reminiscent of the magazine's flattering portrayals or rock legends such as Jim Morrison.

Rolling Stone claimed the story was part of its commitment to 'serious and thoughtful coverage' of important political and cultural issues, but several stores - including Walgreens and CVS - have refused to stock it.

'As a professional law-enforcement officer of 25 years, I believe that 
the image that was portrayed by Rolling Stone magazine was an insult to 
any person who has every worn a uniform of any color or any police 
organization or military branch, and the family members who have ever 
lost a loved one serving in the line of duty.

'The truth is that 
glamorizing the face of terror is not just insulting to the family 
members of those killed in the line of duty, it also could be an 
incentive to those who may be unstable to do something to get their face
on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.

'I hope that the people who 
see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it 
gets.

'This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a 
television show. Officer Dick Donohue almost gave his life. Officer Sean
Collier did give his life. These were real people, with real lives, 
with real families. And to have this cover dropped into Boston was 
hurtful to their memories and their families.

'I know from first-hand 
conversations that this Rolling Stone cover has kept many of them 
up - again. It’s irritated the wounds that will never heal - again. There is
nothing glamorous in bringing more pain to a grieving family.

'Photography
is very simple, it’s very basic. It brings us back to the cave. An 
image like this on the cover of Rolling Stone, we see it instantly as 
being wrong.

'What Rolling Stone did was wrong. This guy is evil. This is
the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of
Rolling Stone magazine.'
