UEFA have modified CSKA Moscow's punishment for trouble by their fans at their Champions League match away to AS Roma on appeal.

CSKA were originally ordered to play their next three European home games behind closed doors after incidents involving their supporters, including racist behaviour, crowd trouble and setting off flares during the 5-1 defeat in Roma on September 17.

UEFA announced on Tuesday that the ban now applies to two matches.

'The latest (of the three matches) is suspended for a probationary period of five years,' UEFA added, referring to the modification.

The Russian Premier League champions have already played the first of the two matches of the original suspension, a 2-2 draw against Manchester City in Moscow last week. Their next visitors will be Roma.

The Army Men also had their fine reduced from £158,000 (200,000 euros) to £79,000 (100,000 euros). Their prohibition from selling tickets for their next two Champions League away games stands.

CSKA would not comment with their press officer Sergey Aksenov saying: 'We are not ready to make any comments until we receive the official reasoning for their decision. We expect to receive it within a week.'

The team's draw with City gave them their first points after three group matches. They lost 5-1 in Rome and 1-0 at home to unbeaten group leaders Bayern Munich.

City were left furious last week after UEFA revealed they would not take action against CSKA  for allowing fans in to their behind closed doors match.

The visitors were flabbergasted to see 300 rowdy Russian fans standing drinking beer — itself a breach of Champions League rules — in the main stand of the Khimki Arena in Moscow to watch their side snatch a 2-2 draw with a disputed late penalty.

Hearing stories of media passes and sponsor tickets being sold to CSKA fans and suspicious that security staff may also have let fans through the gates, City asked UEFA to look in to the issue.

However, UEFA declared themselves happy with the way things had been handled, prompting dismay and anger at City whose own travelling fans had been prevented by police from reaching an apartment overlooking the stadium from which they planned to watch the game.
