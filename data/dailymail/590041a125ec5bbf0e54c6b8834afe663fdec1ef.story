A 19-year-old gymnast has broken the record for the world's longest slam dunk after completing the trick shot from 10 metres away.

Jordan Ramos, from Liverpool, used a trampoline to launch himself more than 25ft through the air towards the hoop inside a television studio in Milan, Italy.

The teenager, who has represented Great Britain in gymnastics and sprinting, beat his own record of 7.75m he set in 2010, when he was just 14.

Aerial: Jordan broke the record on his fourth attempt - reaching the basket from his starting point 10m away 

The teenage athlete, who has also competed for Great Britain in sprinting and gymnastics, battled against an opponent, from Hungary, to claim the title.

Jordan and his challenger went head-to-head in front of a studio audience and the record attempt is due to air on Italian TV later this year.

The two athletes attempted four distances, starting at 8.2m, advancing to 8.5m, 9.1m and finally the 10m jump, which saw Jordan claim victory.

Jordan said: 'Words can’t describe how I am feeling right now, I’m on top of the world.

'My Manager has told me that there is an opportunity for me to fly out to Mexico and China later on this year to increase on my 10m record. 

Finish: He slams the ball into the basket before touching down on the ground

'But at the moment I feel I just want to enjoy my success with this record - and get back to the UK and concentrate on starting Drama School in September.

'Maybe when I have had a good nights sleep and I am less exhausted, I might reconsider attempting the record twice more this year.

'But for now I just want to enjoy the moment and celebrate with my family and friends.'

Sporting star Jordan is coached by his father Marcelo ‘the daredevil’ Ramos and they form part of the ‘Ramos Acrobats’ alongside mum Anita and younger brother Samuel, 11.
