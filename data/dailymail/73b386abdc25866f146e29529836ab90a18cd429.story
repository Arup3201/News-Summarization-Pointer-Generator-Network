Norwegian businesswoman Marte Deborah Dalelv, 24, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for extramarital sex after she reported being raped

The identity of the Norwegian 
woman who was sentenced to 16 months in prison for 
extramarital sex after she reported being 
raped in Dubai has been revealed for the first time today.

Smiling happily into the camera, Marte Deborah Dalelv looks like she doesn't have a care in the world.

But the 24-year-old was brutally raped while on a business trip in United Arab Emirates and was handed a prison sentence for having sex outside of marriage after reporting it to police.

Ms Dalelv
 reported the sexual assault in March this year, after which she had to 
spend days in a cell before she was allowed to use a telephone.

With
 the help of family members, the Norwegian consulate was able to 
negotiate a release and she has been living under the protection of the 
Norwegian Sailor’s Church until her sentencing this week.

'I
 received the harshest sentence for sex outside marriage, harshest 
sentence for drinking alcohol and on top of that I was found guilty of 
perjury,’ she told Verdens Gang.

‘It is a terrible situation she is in,’ said Gisle Meling, the priest at the Norwegian Sailor’s Church.

‘We
 are very surprised and had hoped it would go another way, but we live 
in a country which has a justice system which draws its conclusions with
 the help of Sharia law.’

Ms Dalelv was sentenced to one year and four months in jail but as Norway has no extradition treaty with Dubai, her future is uncertain.

The young Norwegian woman's story is not unique.

Earlier
 this year Australian Alicia Gali, 27, spoke of how she was thrown in a 
Dubai jail for eight months after she reported a rape.

Miss Gali was working at hotel chain Starwood when her drink was spiked in the staff bar.

She
 awoke to find that three colleagues had raped her, but when she went to
 a hospital for help, they turned her over to the police and she was 
charged with illicit sex outside marriage.

Under
 UAE law, rapists can only be convicted if either the perpetrator 
confesses or if four adult Muslim males witness the crime.

Under
 the Sharia-influenced laws, sex before marriage is completely forbidden
 and an unmarried couple holding hands in public can be jailed.

Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.

Dark side: Having been detained in Dubai since the assault in March, Ms  Dalelv has now been found guilty of sex outside marriage, drinking alcohol without a licence and perjury and was jailed for 16 months
