A Christian blogger and mother-of-four who begged fellow cancer sufferer Brittany Maynard not to end her life has died aged 38.

Kara Tippetts, an author from Colorado Springs, Colorado, passed away on Sunday after a lengthy battle with breast cancer, a friend wrote on Tippetts' website, Mundane Faithfulness.

'She refused to be defined by cancer and considered every moment a gift and an opportunity to learn more about Grace and trusting God,' friend Blythe Hunt wrote.

Last October, Tippetts penned an open letter to Maynard, a terminal brain cancer patient and a physician-assisted suicide advocate who had decided to take her own life before her suffering worsened.

Tippetts wrote to her: 'You have been told a lie. A horrible lie, that your dying will not be beautiful. That the suffering will be too great.

'I pray (my words) reach the multitudes that are looking at your story and believing the lie that suffering is a mistake, that dying isn't to be braved, that choosing our death is the courageous story.'

She went on: 'In your choosing your own death, you are robbing those that love you with the such tenderness, the opportunity of meeting you in your last moments and extending you love in your last breaths.'

But Tippetts also thanked Maynard for sharing her story and told her she loved her.

Speaking in an earlier interview, Maynard had explained: 'There is not a cell in my body that is suicidal or that wants to die. I want to live. I wish there was a cure for my disease but there's not.'

Plea: She famously penned an open letter to Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old brain cancer sufferer (pictured) who took her life last November. Tippetts had pleaded with Maynard to die naturally

Maynard, who was married, died on November 1, 2014 aged just 29. 

After the letter was shared thousands of times online, Tippetts' book, 'The Hardest Peace', soared to number 14 on Amazon's bestseller list. Tippetts said she was shocked.

'I knew I wanted (Maynard) to be able to hear my letter and feel my love, but I never expected to be in this position,' she told the Colorado Springs Gazette.

'I never expected to be this voice, but it's an important conversation so I'm entering it.' 

Tippetts also leaves behind her husband Jason, whom she married in 1998, and their children Eleanor Grace, Harper Joy, Lake Edward and Story Jane. Her husband founded the Westside Church in Colorado Springs.

In December, her publishers confirmed she had entered hospice care.

Final post: On March 12, she shared this picture to Facebook showing her with her husband Jason, writing: 'Today I'm fading, I can see it in the tears in his eyes... May we continue to enjoy each moment'

In her final blog post on March 10, Tippetts said a nurse had told her she had just days to live - 'News I frankly don't believe,' she wrote.

'I do see where cancer is having it's way with my body,' she went on. 'Where I'm growing weaker or pain is growing stronger. It's been made clear to me I'm fading. I'm just in denial...

'I feel too young to be in this battle, but maybe I'm not in a battle at all. Maybe I'm on a journey, and the journey is more beautiful than any of us can comprehend.'

Then on March 12, she shared a photo to Facebook showing her smiling beside her husband.

'Today I'm fading, I can see it in the tears in his eyes,' she wrote. 'There is going to be grace for this... May we continue to enjoy each moment. Will you do the same?'
