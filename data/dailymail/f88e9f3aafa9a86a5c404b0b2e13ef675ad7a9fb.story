Sir Alex Ferguson was awoken from an apparent slumber in the royal box to watch Andy Murray leap into the air in celebration as he earned a place in the Wimbledon quarter finals.

The 27-year-old stormed to victory against South African opponent 6ft8in Kevin Anderson, after beating him in three straight sets on Centre Court.

The former Manchester United manager had earlier closed his eyes to enjoy a brief snooze as rain halted play in all matches at the All England Club in the early 
afternoon, including that between Alize Cornet and Eugenie Bouchard, which was stopped while the retractable roof was brought 
out.

But he was soon back up on his feet to cheer on his fellow Scotsman, who has won every set he's played at Wimbledon so far this year, as he took the match against the towering 28-year-old from Johannesburg.

Andy Murray celebrates beating South Africa's Kevin Anderson during day eight of the Wimbledon Championships. The 27-year-old beat his giant  6ft 8ins opponent Anderson, 28, in three straight sets on Centre Court last night

The victory by the reigning Wimbledon champion will fuel hopes of a second consecutive title for Murray, as bookmakers slashed the odds on him winning to 5/2

The Countess of Wessex wore a navy blue suit with split skirt for her afternoon of tennis, while Sir Cliff wore a striped suit and tie.  Sir Richard, who was accompanied by his daughter, Holly, 31, was joined in the royal box by broadcaster Sir Trevor Macdonald, and former British football manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.

Sir Alex watched Murray's quarter-final victory last year, and the tennis star described the advice he gave him during a 15-minute chat as 'gold dust'.

Murray said after their meeting last year: ‘It's an unbelievable work ethic for such a long period of time. Spending 15 minutes with him, he's a really impressive guy and you can learn a lot from him.'

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke was also there, and was expected to be joined by singer Elaine Page, Irish golfer Paul McGinley and ex-cabinet secretary Gus O'Donnell.

Winning streak? Andy Murray got off to a strong start, winning the first set and starting the second set well against Kevin Anderson in the fourth round

Tense: Judy Murray is, as ever, hooked watching her son play. She famously refuses to talk to anyone during the matches of either Andy or Jamie

Enraptured: Andy Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo looked on open-mouthed during her player's clash with Anderson

Meanwhile Murray's fans were forced to queue for more than 26 hours to get a ticket for today's big match.

Just 500 Centre Court seats were available for fans in the famous SW19 queue, and those turning up after the early hours of yesterday morning were left disappointed.

A message 
on the official Wimbledon website at 8am yesterday read: 'There are more
 people in the queue than Centre and No.1 Court tickets for Monday.'

Bookmaker Coral has Murray at 20-1 on to beat Anderson, and just 4-11 to win in straight sets.

The odds have also shortened from 3-1 to 5-2 on Murray winning the title again.

Hooked: Jim Parsons, star of American hit TV show The Big Bang Theory, had his eyes glued to the court as Bouchard took on Cornet this afternoon

David Stevens, spokesman for Coral, said: 'As reigning champion, Andy Murray came into this tournament with an even bigger following than 12 months ago.

'That has been reflected in the number of bets we've taken on him, which in turn has forced his odds down to the shortest they have ever been at the start of the second week at SW19.'

Murray's hopes may have been boosted by avoiding any hold-ups amid heavy rain on Saturday.

Cancellations mean fifth seed Stan Wawrinka could face five matches in seven days to reach his first Wimbledon final.

But when Murray was asked if he could stand to benefit from the rejigged schedule, he replied: 'Not really. I've played many grand slams and sometimes the schedule works in your favour and sometimes it doesn't.

Undampened enthusiasm: Fans sheltered under umbrellas on Murray Mount at Wimbledon today during the brief downpour that halted play on all courts

'At least they'll have had a two-day break so they'll be completely fresh when they start. It's just bad luck. It happens sometimes.

'I've had situations where the schedule hasn't worked out. You just get on with it.'

The odds are stacked against Murray's fourth-round opponent, Anderson, but the 28-year-old has been relaxing before the big match by learning to play a musical instrument and enjoying a South African barbecue.

'I've been learning how to play the guitar. That's something I enjoy doing. My mum keeps asking me to play her some tunes, but right now I'm just learning all the different notes.

'I've got a travel electric guitar which I take on the road with me. My acoustic guitar is a bit too big so that's at home,' he told wimbledon.com yesterday.

After his third-round victory on Friday, Anderson posted a picture of himself on Twitter enjoying a traditional feast with the caption: 'A proper South African braai to kick off the weekend right!!!'

Sir Alex Ferguson (arms crossed) took the opportunity to have a quick snooze as he waited for Murray's match on Centre Court today

Meanwhile, the Wimbledon steward who reminded Andy Murray to hug his mother after he won the Wimbledon title last year has told how he helped the Scot avoid 'a great British faux pas'.

One of the most memorable moments of his victory was when he climbed up to the players' box to celebrate with his team, hugging supporters including his girlfriend, Kim Sears, but forgot to hug his mother and earliest coach.

Honorary steward David Spearing - the longest-serving steward at Wimbledon and guardian of the players' box - told how he made sure the new champion thanked his mother, too.

He told BBC Radio 5 live: 'It was rather funny because Andy climbed into the box and was high-fiving it with all his team... he started climbing off the box and I suddenly realised that he hadn't greeted his mother at all.

'So I shouted out "Andy" and he looked up and I said: "Your mother".

'He replied "Oh" and climbed back up and embraced her.'

Whoever wins this year will not have to climb over the commentary box to get to their supporters as there is now a gate for players to walk through.
