The Duchess of Cornwall served up sausages and mash at a tea party for children with terminal illnesses today.

Camilla refused to stand on ceremony as she rolled up her sleeves and handed round plates to the youngsters, who were visiting her official London home, Clarence House.

Each year the Duchess invites 12 young people and their families from the Helen & Douglas House, of which she has been patron since 2007, to help her decorate the royal Christmas tree.

Magical: The Duchess of Cornwall threw a party at Clarence House for a group of terminally ill children

The Helen & Douglas House is an Oxford-based hospice that cares for terminally ill children, young adults and their families.

It provides medical, emotional and practical support, helping families deal with implications of living with a child who will die prematurely, so that they can make the most of their time together.

Opened in 1982, it was the world's first children's hospice and cares for children from birth to 16 years old.

Sporting a pretty fuchsia dress and matching patterned scarf, Camilla chatted to each of the children and their families and heard their often heartbreaking stories.

Among them were Andrew and Kay Lyon from Oxford and their daughter, Sienna, three, who suffers from a rare genetic condition that affects her brain.

Tasty: Camilla served the children and their families a lunch of sausage and mash

Excited: The children and their families had travelled from an Oxford hospice to be at the party

Adorable: One little girl was overwhelmed with excitement as she was introduced to the Duchess

The couple told the Duchess of the support the charity has given them, even looking after Sienna, who suffers from regular seizures and is unable to walk or talk, while they took their older two children on holiday.

'Helen House has been remarkable and the care they give Sienna just unparalleled,' said Mrs Lyon during the event.

'The last three years have been filled with so much gipsies and sadness. It is something we never expected and has opened up a whole new life for us. 

'We don't know how long we will have Sienna with us so this is about up helping us to create some very happy and special memories. Today has been huge part of that.'

Afterwards, the Duchess opened the doors to her drawing room, behind which her assistant equerry from the Welsh Guards, Captain Fred Lloyd George, was waiting to salute the children.

Delighted: The children, all of whom are terminally ill, were left smiling following their encounter

Big moment: Camilla's assistant equerry Captain Fred Lloyd George was on hand to salute the children

Decorations: Each of the youngsters was invited to place a decoration on the Clarence House tree

All smiles: A beaming Camilla told the children that the party was her favourite event of the year

Camilla then helped each child to choose several decorations and carefully placed them on the twinkling tree.

Afterwards it was time for tea, which included sausages and mash, as well as chocolate Christmas trees and beautifully decorated biscuits.

It's lovely to see you all and I hope you have enjoyed yourselves,' said Camilla as her guests finished their meal.

'This is one of my favourite things to do each year and seeing your faces as the door opens is magical. Helen & Douglas House is a wonderful, uplifting place. Everyone should visit it.'

Camilla also comforted Marie McVicar from Wiltshire who tragically lost her son, Ollie Samways, seven, as a result of complication from pre-exciting brain damage, at the beginning of November.

Ollie's sister, Shayla, four, put his decoration on the tree instead.

Marie, who is pregnant with a baby boy, due in February, said: 'Ollie sadly died at the hospice from a chest infection last month and I would do anything to support them. They have become my family.

'Ollie was a very special little boy and met the Duchess when she visited the hospice earlier this year. She remembered him immediately and was a huge comfort.'

Clare Edwards, chief operating officer at Helen and Douglas House, described the event as 'magical'.

'It's such a unique day, so special,' she said. 'It makes the children feel so worthy and special and important.

'It's a real privilege to have the Duchess as our patron. She take such an interest in the work we do and her patronage helps to shine a light on children's palliative care.'

Pretty: Each of the children was allowed to choose several ornaments to hang on the tree

Traditional: Most had a traditional theme and were hung by the Duchess as well as the children

Special: According to the charity, the party leaves the children feeling 'special and worthy'
