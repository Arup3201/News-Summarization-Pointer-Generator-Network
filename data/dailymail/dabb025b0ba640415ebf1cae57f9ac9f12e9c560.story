The star of ABC's The Bachelor has sparked widespread outrage by calling gay people perverted and saying they should not be allowed on the hit reality show.

Juan Pablo Galavis, 32, was asked about his views on having a bisexual or gay version of the popular program when he candidly declared that a homosexual version of The Bachelor would not be a good idea.

TV bosses have been quick to respond calling his comments 'careless, thoughtless and insensitive'.

On the record: Juan Pablo Galavis, the 32-year-old star of The Bachelor who also appeared on the most recent season of The Bachelorette, made the remarks in an interview

Strange views: ABC's latest Bachelor says he doesn't think that there should be a gay or bisexual on the broadcast reality television show and described gays as 'more pervert in a sense'

At
 a 'network party' on Friday night in Pasadena, California, Mr 
Galavis was asked for his thoughts on allowing gay people onto the show.

Mr
 Galavis, reportedly told The TV Page's Sean Daly in a radio interview: 'No... I respect 
[gay people] but, honestly, I don't think it's a good example for 
kids...'

'Obviously people 
have their husband and wife and kids and that is how we are brought up. 
Now there is fathers having kids and all that, and it is hard for me to 
understand that too in the sense of a household having peoples… Two 
parents sleeping in the same bed and the kid going into bed… It is 
confusing in a sense.'

The off-color remarks made by Mr Galavis, who is the show's first Latino 
bachelor, didn't end there as he continued airing his conservative 
views.

'There's this thing about gay people... it seems to me, and
 I don't know if I'm mistaken or not... but they're more 'pervert' in a 
sense. And to me the show would be too strong... too hard to watch.'

Outnumbered: Juan Pablo Galavis is the first Hispanic to lead the love charge on The Bachelor, but he doesn't feel the show has room for gays

The
 single dad, who has been known to duck out of dates to spend time with 
his four-year-old daughter Camila, attempted to justify his comments by 
stating that he has many gay friends and co-workers.

In the run-up to this season's The 
Bachelor, fans of Juan Pablo Galavis were calling him 
'Juan-in-a-million' and 'Juan-derful. They may now be questioning their
 judgement.

Galavis' legions of fans pushed back against the avalanche of criticism, accusing his detractors of misinterpreting the reality star's comments and censuring him for merely expressing his personal views.

Damian Holbrook, senior writer for TV Guide Magazine who happens to be gay, came to Galavis' defense Saturday afternoon, posting a photo of himself in the company of the hunky 32-year-old.

'@JuanPaGalavis groped me last night. He does NOT have a problem with gays, Holbrook wrote in the message, which Galavis himself later retweeted to his 219,300 followers.

ABC, Warner Horizon and The Bachelor executive producers issued a statement on Saturday afternoon slamming Mr Galavis’ statements.

'Juan Pablo’s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show’s producers or studio,' the statement read.

Apology: Pablo Galavis has said sorry to anyone that he has offended. 'If you listen to the entire interview, there's nothing but respect for Gay people and their families' he says

Some of my best friends are gay: Galavis was asked whether ABC should have a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show. 'No,' Pablo Galavis responded. 'I don't think it's a good example for kids to watch that on TV. It's hard, it's hard, it's a very thin line.'

Response: ABC, Warner Horizon and The Bachelor executive producers just issued a statement slamming Bachelor star Juan Pablo Galavis¿ statements. They say his comments were 'careless, thoughtless and insensitive'

The insensitive comments come just as ABC appears to be throwing it weight behind Mr Galavis and the long-running television show.

He is one the networks' most popular stars in some time having reinvigorated the Bachelor franchise, now in its 18th season.

ABC
 has even been airing Bachelor specials in addition to the regular 
episodes with the channel added two more hours of The Bachelor a week to
 take advantage of promising viewing figures that have been generated so
 far this season.

Pablo Galavis has released a statement on his Facebook page saying the interview takes his remarks out of context.

'I want to apologize to all the people I may have offended because of my comments on having a Gay or Bisexual Bachelor.

The
 comment was taken out of context. If you listen to the entire 
interview, there's nothing but respect for Gay people and their 
families. I have many gay friends and one of my closest friends who's 
like a brother has been a constant in my life especially during the past
 5 months.

The word pervert
 was not what I meant to say and I am very sorry about it. Everyone 
knows English is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as
 it is in Spanish and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words 
to express myself.

What
 I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense 
and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept.

The
 show is very racy as it is and I don't let my five-year-old daughter 
watch it. Once again, I'm sorry for how my words were taken. I would 
never disrespect anyone.'

Outspoken: The Venezuelan former footballer said he felt that gay people were more 'pevert'

Impressionable: It makes one wonder whether the 32-year-old reality star is teaching this 'culture' to his four-year-old daughter Camila with ex-girlfriend, Carla Rodriguez

On
 Facebook, Galavis’ mea culpa has received a mixed response, with some 
of his supporters blaming the media for stirring up controversy.

Most commenters, however, blasted Galavis for his perceived bigotry and homophobia.

'What
 a jerk you are,' one Michael Shockley wrote on Galavis' Facebook page. 
'The bachelor makes a joke out of love and marriage in the first place. I
 think it is confusing for a kid to see the bachelor.'

User Sean 
Riley called out the single father as a hypocrite who espouses 
traditional family values while dating 20 women at once on TV ‘for 
money.’

In a brutal takedown of Galavis, The Salt Lake Tribune TV 
critic Scott D. Pierce went even farther, calling the Bachelor 'a big, 
stinkin' homophobe' and a 'narrow-minded bigot.'

Pierce also took 
issue with Galavis' apology, in which he insisted that he does not hold 
homophobic views because he has many gay friends. '

'Which is sort of like a racial bigot insisting that he has black friends,' Pierce wrote.

Pierce
 reported that in an amusing twist, on the day of the fateful party in 
Pasadena, TV critics staying at the Langham Hotel had roses delivered to
 their rooms with an attached card that read: 'Will you accept this 
rose? - Juan Pablo.'

'It was delivered to both the female and male critics,' Pierce wrote. 'Galavis must be horrified.'

As a single father, Juan Pablo is 
looking for not just someone to be his wife, but also someone to be a 
mother to his daughter Camila.

He explained: ‘I'm going to find hopefully the person who is going to join me and my daughter. That's what I'm looking for.’

Juan Pablo quickly became a fan favorite thanks during last years The Bachelorette to his clear devotion to his four-year-old

'It's
 a great responsibility because I am going to find hopefully the person 
who is going to be with me and my daughter,' he said.

Critics wasted no time drawing comparisons between Galavis, the suave serial dater, to Phil Robertson, the rugged star of the popular A&E show Duck Dynasty.

The bearded patriarch of the Robertson clan from Louisiana caused a monumental uproar when he equated homosexuals with terrorists, prostitutes and people who engage in bestiality in an interview with GQ magazine for the January issue.

Following a brief suspension, Phil was reinstated on the show just in time for the premiere of season 5 this week.

However, Mr Robertson’s anti-gay remarks may have done their damage, as the hit show, once considered the single most popular reality program on TV, had a 28 per cent drop in ratings compared to the debut of season 4 last year.
