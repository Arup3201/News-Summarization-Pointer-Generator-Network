The lavish spending in the Premier League has been laid bare after the transfer window closed with clubs spending £858m — more than was splashed out in Spain’s La Liga (£425m), Italy’s Serie A (£260m) and France’s Ligue 1 (£100m) combined.

Even Germany’s finest could not compete, with Premier League clubs’ outlay three times higher than the Bundesliga’s spending of £250m plus another £100m.

Much of the money comes from huge TV deals in England and allow even a middling Premier League club to splash out more than the vast majority of foreign clubs on fees and wages. Here Sportsmail analyses how the money was spent ...

MORE FOREIGN SIGNINGS THAN DOMESTIC DEALS

Of the total summer spending, Premier League clubs forked out £520.8m on players from overseas clubs (outside England, Scotland and Wales). 

Spending on those from British clubs (£336.9m) was just 39 per cent of the total. Spanish clubs collectively received £239.1m for 15 players, including Angel di Maria (£59.7m), while other big recipients were Portugal, France and Holland.

Angel Di Maria [Real Madrid - Manchester United] £59.7m

Alexis Sanchez [Barcelona - Arsenal] £35m

Diego Costa [Atletico Madrid - Chelsea] £32m

Eliaquim Mangala [FC Porto - Manchester City] £32m

Cesc Fabregas [Barcelona - Chelsea] £30m

Ander Herrera [Athletic Bilbao - Manchester United] £29m

Romelu Lukaku [Chelsea - Everton] £28m

Luke Shaw [Southampton - Manchester United] £27m (could rise to £31m)

Adam Lallana [Southampton - Liverpool] £25m

Dejan Lovren [Southampton - Liverpool] £20m

Lazar Markovic [Benfica - Liverpool] £20m

WHO HAS SPENT THE BEST?

Manchester United spent the most (gross £153.1m), and Stoke spent the least (gross £3.4m) while Southampton made a £30.7m profit on their transfers.

Fans of individual clubs will make their own assessments on whether they have stronger squads but nobody would argue United have added class.

Chelsea have done the best value business by a country mile in pure finance terms, making a slight profit while improving. And Leicester and Southampton also do well on pure value (better or similar squad strength for a small outlay or profit).

Players bought included seven goalkeepers, 36 defenders, 37 midfielders and 23 strikers.

Penny pincher: Stoke manager Mark Hughes spent the least in the transfer window with a $3.4m gross outlay
