Defiant: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson insists we will fall behind in farming technology if we outlaw GM techniques

Owen Paterson yesterday launched a stinging attack on those who are concerned about the dangers of genetically-modified food.

The Environment Secretary accused those opposed to the development of GM foods as being ‘politically-motivated’ and said blocking the technology risked making the UK a ‘museum of farming’.

Critics say that tampering with the genes in crops to create ‘Frankenstein foods’ could damage natural ecosystems or even affect human health.

But this month EU politicians are expected to approve the licensing of the first commercial food crop in 15 years using the controversial technology.

Mr Paterson will vote to approve the crop - an insect-resistant maize developed jointly by DuPont and Dow Chemical - at a meeting of the European Environment Council.

And yesterday the Environment Secretary, speaking at the Oxford Farming Conference, said: ‘If approval is granted, as it should be based on the scientific evidence, then it will be the first GM food crop authorised for planting by the EU for 15 years.

‘Whether or not this vote heralds a breakthrough in the EU’s regulation of GM crops remains to be seen.

‘Delays and blockages have been politically-motivated rather than based on evidence.’

He added: ‘I will continue to make the case for a regime that allows fair market access for products once they have passed Europe’s rigorous, independent scientific assessment.

‘Let me be clear, there are other tools in the toolbox, GM is not a panacea. But the longer that Europe continues to close its doors to GM, the greater the risk that the rest of the world will bypass us altogether.

‘Europe risks becoming the Museum of World Farming as innovative companies make decisions to invest and develop new technologies in other markets.’

Last night anti-GM campaigners responded with fury to Mr Paterson’s claims - and said he was ignoring decades of research that shows the scientific argument for meddling with nature has not yet been won.

Peter Melchett, policy director of organic farming group the Soil Association, said: ‘The accusation that opposition to GM is “political” is simply a politician’s way of sidestepping the overwhelming scientific, safety and market arguments against GM.

Backlash: Critics attacked Paterson for 'ignoring decades of research' that shows it is bad to meddle with nature

‘The fact is that no tests are done to check whether GM food is safe for people to eat.

‘Not a single British supermarket has said they will buy GM crops and sell them, and British consumers remain just as opposed to GM food as ever.

‘What Owen Paterson, the UK Government and European regulators do or do not decide about particular GM crops is neither here nor there.

‘Farmers don’t grow what Owen Paterson tells them to grow, and Owen Paterson doesn’t buy what they do grow.’

Friends of the Earth food campaigner Vicki Hird added: ‘Despite decades of research, evidence shows there are still no miracle crops to tackle important issues agriculture faces, such as climate change, soil degradation, water shortages and meeting growing demand.

Peter Kendall, president of the National Farmers' Union, said scientists were fleeing to America due to over-regulation

‘Our farming system certainly needs to change, but this should focus on less-intensive practices that increase agricultural diversity and benefit local people and the environment.’ Innovations in GM technology were, however, backed by the National Farmers Union.

NFU president Peter Kendall warned that European scientists were fleeing to America because of over-regulation.

He said: ‘They do not believe we are ever going to adopt this technology. We have got to make decisions based on science and not on politics.

‘Boy, have we got to make decisions if we want European agriculture to be globally competitive and not start with the premise that we are going to protect artisan agriculture at all costs.’

He said he was concerned that debate about GM was dominated by ‘myth and scare and no science whatsoever’ and added: ‘We have got to put science in the decision making and reduce the politics.’

If approved, the new crop would be the second GM food product to be grown in the European Union after Monsanto won approval for another insect-resistant corn variety in 1998.

The crop is unlikely to be grown in Britain because the insects it has been bred to resist do not live in the country.

France, Austria and Italy are among countries expected to oppose approval, while supporters are likely to include Britain, Sweden and Spain.

By comparison, GM crops are grown widely in the Americas and parts of Asia.

Mr Paterson faces an uphill struggle convincing the British public of GM benefits.

A recent survey by the Food Standards Agency found two out of three UK shoppers wanted products from animals fed a GM diet to be labelled.
