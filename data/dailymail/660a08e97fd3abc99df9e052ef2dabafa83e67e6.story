First-time Academy Award nominee and screenplay writer Graham Moore opened up about his suicidal past as a teenager while he accepted an award for his work on The Imitation Game.

As Moore took the stage after winning the award for Best Adapted Screenplay at the 87th Annual Academy Awards, he spoke about trying to take his own life at the age of 16 during his touching  speech.

The 33-year-old was inspired by the main character in his film, Alan Turing, who changed the course of the war benefiting the allies after he helped crack a German code during the Second World War. Turing was convicted later in his life for being openly gay.

Moore has come out saying he is not gay following assumptions with his connection to Turing, and said he was moved by Turing's story because he dealt with depression, according to BuzzFeed.

Moore said that while he could stand in front of everyone, Turing could not because he took his own life at 41 years old. And to Moore, that was the 'most unfair thing he has ever heard' (above Cumberbatch pictured bottom, with cast mates, from left: Keira Knightley, Matthew Beard, Matthew Goode and Allen Leech in scenes from the film)

He said that while everyone feels like 'weirdos' for various reasons, that just like Turing, he also had his own share of quirks which made him drawn to his story.

During his speech, Moore said that while he could stand in front of everyone, Turing could not because he took his own life at 41 years old. And for him, because Turing never had that chance, it was the 'most unfair thing he has ever heard'.

'When I was 16, I tried to kill myself because I felt weird and I felt different and I felt like I did not belong,' he said.

'I would like this moment to be for the kid out there who feels like she's weird and different and feels like she doesn't belong. Yes, you do. I promise you do.

Moore said: 'I would like this moment to be for the kid out there who feels like she's weird and different and feels like she doesn't belong. Yes, you do. I promise you do'

He said that he did not have every word of his speech planned out before taking the stage, but that it was already loosely in his head (above Moore left, and Susan Sher, right, at 87th Annual Academy Awards)

'Stay weird, stay different. And then, when it's your turn and you are standing on this stage, please pass the same message to the next person who comes along.' 

Moore, who has not previously spoken openly about depression, said that he did not have every word of his speech planned out but that it was already loosely in his head.

His moving speech has been welcomed with much praise with several stars including Ellen DeGeneres and singer Ariana Grande applauding it.

Singer Ariana Grande asked if anyone else wanted to hug and thank Moore after his moving speech (above)

DeGeneres wrote on Twitter: 'Congratulations Graham Moore. That speech was beautiful. You should think about being a writer.'

While Grande posted: 'Anyone else want to hug and thank Graham Moore?'

The screenwriter said he had imagined the moment on stage as a teenager when he would get to say those things during an acceptance speech, and said that it was surreal to be able to do it for once in real life.
