American soldiers who are returning from Ebola-stricken Liberia will be quarantined for 21 days under strict new guidelines, the Army has said.

A dozen servicemen, including their commander, Major General Darryl Williams, are already in 'controlled monitoring' at their base in Vicenza, Italy, after returning from the West African nation.

They are being confined to a housing complex with barracks, a dining hall and a gym, but no outside access, cannot return to their homes and must not interact with other personnel at the site.

They must also undergo twice-daily temperature checks for the deadly virus, which has so far claimed the lives of at least 4,922 people, mainly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

This is despite the soldiers having been kept apart from any Ebola patients during the 30 days they were helping to build treatment units and training local healthcare workers in the country.

Although the guidelines have only affected 13 personnel so far, they could potentially affect up to 4,000 in total, the number that President Barack Obama has committing to sending abroad.

Around 600 U.S. military staff - including engineers, medical officials and logisticians - are currently in Liberia; several dozen of whom will be quarantined on their return to Vicenza later this week.

In a statement, the Army told ABC that officials that the decision to issue a 'controlled monitoring period' to returning troops had been made over the weekend.

It said: 'The Army Chief of Staff [General Ray Odierno] has directed a 21-day controlled monitoring period for all redeploying soldiers returning from Operation United Assistance.

'He has done this out of caution to ensure soldiers, family members and their surrounding communities are confident that we are taking all steps necessary to protect their health.' 

A Pentagon spokesman added: 'Out of an abundance of caution the Army directed a small number of personnel, about a dozen, that recently returned to Italy to be monitored in a separate location at their home station of Vicenza. 

'None of these individuals have shown any symptoms of exposure.'

The new rules are contrary to the Department of Defense's current policy that 'as long as individuals remain asymptomatic, they may return to work and routine daily activities with family members'.

However, a DOD spokesman said there has so far been 'no decision' to implement the new guidelines 'force wide', adding: 'any such decision would be made by the Secretary of Defense'.

Upon his departure from Liberia on Saturday, Williams transferred command of Operation Unified Assistance to Major General Gary Volesky, who presides over the 101st Airborne Division.

Williams and his troop were then met off their plane by Italian authorities in 'full CDC gear' believed to include hazmat suits and protective masks, a U.S. military official told CNN.

There is no indication that any of the team have signs or symptoms of Ebola, which include a fever, a headache, diarrhea, vomiting, muscle and joint aches and in some cases bleeding.  

While in Liberia, soldiers are forced to undergo numerous temperature checks by medical professionals on a daily basis, according to NBC.

The new guidelines come as U.S. health officials have issued rules urging voluntary, at-home quarantine for all health workers that have treated Ebola patients in West Africa. 

Previously the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended screening of travelers from West Africa and monitoring of people for three weeks after they arrive in the United States.

But now, 'high risk' travelers have been told to avoid transport and allow state medics to monitor them daily.

'We are concerned about some policies that we have seen... that might have the effect of increasing stigma or creating false impressions,' CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden said today, as he unveiled the four categories of risk that travelers will be separated in to.

His words were a direct attack on New York and New Jersey governors' controversial decision to put all medics returning from the disease-hit region into mandatory quarantine.

Yesterday, nurse Kaci Hickox was finally released from a New Jersey hospital, where she was held for three days against her will despite testing negative for Ebola.

The 33-year-old threatened to sue the state for placing her in an unheated, 15ft x 20ft isolation tent with no working toilet in the University Hospital parking lot in Newark on Friday - despite showing no symptoms of Ebola and repeatedly insisting she is healthy.

She was the first person to fall under the state's tighter prevention measures. 

The latest Ebola death toll brings the total of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 10,141.
