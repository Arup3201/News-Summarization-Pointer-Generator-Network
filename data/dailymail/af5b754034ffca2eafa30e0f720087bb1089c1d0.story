Paris could become a ‘semi-pedestrianised’ city in plans set out by the mayor to tackle traffic and pollution.

Anne Hidalgo said she wanted to ban diesel cars from the city centre by 2020, while some neighbourhoods would become pedestrian only.

She said: ‘In the four central districts, apart from bikes, buses and taxis, the only vehicles allowed will be residents’ cars, delivery vehicles and emergency vehicles.’

Restrictions: Anne Hidalgo said she wanted to limit the traffic on some of the most polluted streets, such as the Champs-Elysees (pictured above), to ‘clean vehicles’. She said 60 per cent of Parisians do not own a car

Paris experiences periodic pollution spikes, forcing the authorities to impose temporary speed limits or even ban vehicles on certain days.

Miss Hidalgo, 55, told the Journal de Dimanche that the proposed scheme would start at weekends but could quickly be extended.

She also said she wanted to limit the traffic on some of the most polluted streets, such as the Champs-Elysees, to ‘clean vehicles’. She said 60 per cent of Parisians do not own a car. 

Ms Hidalgo, a member of France’s ruling Socialist Party, said financial incentives would be available for the purchase of more environmentally friendly cars. 

Bikes are expected to become the favoured form of transport, with cycle lanes ‘doubled by 2020’ as part of a plan that will cost more than £90million. 

The French capital is the most popular tourist city in the world, with Britons the biggest visitor group, and they frequently complain about the traffic problems.

Solution: Bicycles are expected to become the favoured form of transport, with the number of cycle lanes set to be ‘doubled by 2020’ as part of a plan that will cost more than £90million, according to Ms Hidalgo

Pollution increases over the summer forced the city council to impose temporary speed limits on motorists, to ban vehicles with specific number plates from being used on specified days.

Ms Hidalgo said she only wanted to see ‘clean vehicles’ in the city, saying: ‘I want diesel cars out of Paris by 2020 and if possible beyond the outer ring road.

‘Today, 60 per cent of Parisians don’t have their own car whereas in 2011, it was 40 per cent. It’s moving quickly’.
