It was one of the most iconic images of last season’s thrilling title race, Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard huddled with his players on the Anfield turf imploring them not to falter in the wake of their 3-2 victory over Manchester City that appeared to have nudged momentum their way.

In the mind of Manuel Pellegrini, though, it was the work simultaneously being done in the losers’ dressing room that day that ultimately made the difference.

From the desolation and pain of what City manager Pellegrini has always maintained was an unjust defeat grew the resolution to produce a five-match winning sequence that snatched City’s second title in three years.

Despair: Manchester City succumbed to a 3-2 defeat at Anfield last season but eventually won the title

Elation: Philippe Coutinho netted the winner for Liverpool against Manchester City at Anfield in April

Reflection: Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists defeat at Anfield inspired their title victory

‘The turning point was when we lost that game against them at Anfield,’ said Pellegrini ahead of Monday’s meeting between the teams at the Etihad Stadium.

‘We were convinced we had to win the last five games to win the title and we knew we could do it.

‘We were absolutely convinced we could do it because we felt when we lost against Liverpool that we played better than Liverpool in that game.

‘It was a special day for Liverpool and there were a lot of mistakes by the referee also, but we never complained about that.

‘We never opened our mouths or said anything about the referees. We were sure that if we were able to win the last five games we would do it.

‘Of course it acted as motivation because when you finish that game, if you feel the other team is better than you, maybe they deserved to be the champions.

‘But all of us finished that game thinking we were unlucky to lose.’

Liverpool’s Gerrard, of course, was to have his own moment of ignimony further down the stretch. A slip against Chelsea in his team’s next home game effectively handed the initiative back to Pellegrini and his City side.

‘They were very unlucky in that game against Chelsea but they were very lucky in the game they played against us because Vincent Kompany had a very similar slip before their winning goal,’ said the Chilean.

‘It wasn’t exactly the same (as Gerrard’s slip), but very similar. Of course I feel sorry for him. I always feel sorry for players who make a mistake but I don’t think that slip decided the title. There were 38 games through the whole year and, anyway, it was not really a mistake.’

‘It was a problem with the pitch. It is not that he missed a pass inside the box or something. It was slippy, it can happen to any player.’

Despite Liverpool’s efforts last season, Brendan Rodgers and his team arrive in Manchester on Monday facing some questions.

With Luis Suarez now a Barcelona player, many feel that Liverpool’s title challenge has already been neutered.

One feels Pellegrini suspects the same, even if he is too cute to say so directly.

‘It is very difficult to replace a player that did what Luis Suarez did last season,’ he added.

‘It was a very important season for Luis Suarez. Maybe in his first year at Liverpool it was not so important for him.

‘But to replace what he did last year is very difficult. But I suppose with all the players they bought they will do it.’

Liverpool manager Rodgers has occasionally spoken a little dismissively of City’s own approach to the transfer market, suggesting that the Merseyside club do things ‘differently’.

Again, though, Pellegrini has no time for the criticism.

‘It was very important the way we finished the season last year, not only to win the games in the Premier League but also to demonstrate the character of this team,’ stressed Pellegrini.

‘A lot of media always talk about money, but this is not money. You can’t do that just with money - you can do it with character, personality, with style of play, a lot of things.

‘Maybe we have to discuss longer about that some day but always when we win it is not about money.

‘I am absolutely sure that if you do not spend money on a good squad it is impossible to win the title.Other teams spend money also. This year there are a lot of teams who have spent more than us.

‘So it is not about money. It is money in the sense you need a strong squad but there are lot of things after the money you must do if you want to be champions.’
