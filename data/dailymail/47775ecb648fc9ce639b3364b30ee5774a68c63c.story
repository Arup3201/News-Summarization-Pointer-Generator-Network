Latvia has warned the Swedish hunt for a Russian submarine spotting in its water could become a security 'game changer'.

The Swedish military today began their fifth day of searchers, after yesterday closing off waters and airspace off Stockholm and widening their search area from 30 miles to 45 miles southeast of the capital.

Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics wrote on Twitter: 'Closely following events in the Swedish territorial waters, may become a game changer of the security in the whole Baltic Sea region.'

Latvia has warned the Swedish hunt for a Russian submarine spotting in its water could become a security 'game changer' in the Baltic sea

Sweden's biggest submarine hunt since the Cold War has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge

Sweden's biggest submarine hunt since the dying days of the Soviet Union has put countries around the Baltic Sea on edge.

The events in the past days have sparked alarm across the Baltic Sea in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — three small former Soviet republics already spooked by Russia's intervention in Ukraine. 

Estonia stepped up surveillance of its territorial waters, with the border guard looking out for 'potential anomalies,' spokesman Priit Parkna said.

Lithuanians were concerned over the safety of a floating natural gas import terminal currently being transported on the Baltic Sea to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda. The terminal will be key to Lithuania's plans to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.

Yesterday the military confirmed it has made three sightings - two on Friday, and one on Sunday - of foreign undersea activity and it was revealed they were also investigating reports of a mysterious man seen with a backpack wading into the sea. 

One theory was that an experimental Russian mini-sub called the Triton NN had got into trouble on a spy mission in Swedish waters.

The Triton-NN - developed around six years ago - has been called 'the synthesis of high-speed boat and underwater vehicle'. 

Yesterday the military confirmed it has made three sightings - two on Friday, and one on Sunday - of foreign undersea activity and  revealed they were also investigating reports of a mysterious man seen with a backpack 

It is a 'submersible boat' capable of landing personnel on enemy beaches or depositing divers in key locations.

On Sunday the military also released a grainy picture showing a partially submerged object, believed to be the 'foreign vessel' in the Stockholm Arcipelago.

As their hunt intensified yesterday, Russian authorities who have denied any involvement, instead pointed the finger at the Dutch. They quickly denied the allegation.  

Meanwhile, Russian media suggested the Swedes were overreacting. The Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper even speculated that the submarine hunt could be a ploy by the Swedish military to boost its defense budget, which has undergone a series of cuts since the Cold War.

The official government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta questioned whether there was any submarine at all, noting the Swedes hadn't found anything.

'Either Sweden's echo location equipment is working badly or, as the old saying goes, the eyes of fear see danger everywhere,' the paper said.

Military spokesman Jesper Tengroth said more than 200 personnel were involved in the operation, but stressed that unlike Sweden's submarine hunts in the 1980s, the military wasn't using depth charges or other anti-submarine weapons.

Speculating on whether the suspected underwater intruder was linked to a mother ship, Swedish media zeroed in on an oil tanker owned by Russian company Novoship, which had been circling near Swedish waters.

The submarine scare in Sweden comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow's growing assertiveness in the Baltic Sea region

In a statement yesterday, Novoship President Yuri Tsvetkov said he was 'flattered' by the attention but said the ship was charted for transporting oil from Russia to the U.S. and was drifting on standby awaiting loading orders. 

The submarine scare in Sweden comes after a string of border incidents involving Russian forces that Western analysts say signal Moscow's growing assertiveness in the Baltic Sea region.

Finland's Environment Institute said last week that Russian military ships had twice intercepted one of its research vessels in international waters.

On September 5 an Estonian security service officer was detained on the Russian border — Estonia and Russia disagree on which side of it — and is still in custody in Moscow.

Both Sweden and Finland, which are not NATO members, have reported airspace violations by Russian military aircraft in the past two months.

Even when they stay in international airspace, Russian aircraft are conducting more ambitious maneuvers than at any point since the end of the Cold War, Western analysts say. 

During Easter last year, Russian warplanes exercising over the Baltic Sea appeared to simulate attacks on targets in Sweden, embarrassing the Swedish Air Force which didn't have any jets on standby.

'These are aggressive attack drills where they make a clear statement to their neighbors,' said strategic analyst Magnus Christiansson of the Swedish National Defense College.

NATO says Russian airborne military activity in the Baltic region so far this year is two-and-a-half times higher than last year, and the alliance has boosted its own air patrols over tiny members Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

However, a submarine sneaking into another country's territorial waters would be much more serious than muscle-flexing maneuvers in the air, Christiansson said.

 'To have military forces operating secretly on another country's territory, that's something different,' he said. 'It is a hostile act.'
