Tottenham have severed links with one of their official licensed suppliers after three pitch invasions caused a 10-minute delay to their Europa League clash against Partizan Belgrade and left them facing a UEFA charge.

Despite securing their place in the last 32 of the competition thanks to Benjamin Stambouli’s second half goal, the club’s night was overshadowed by the serious breaches of security which led to Ukrainian referee Yevhen Aranovskiy taking both teams from the field four minutes before half-time.

All three culprits were wearing shirts emblazoned with the logo of audio manufacturers BassBuds, who sell official branded headphones through the club’s merchandise store.

The second of three supporters had his shirt ripped off by Roberto Soldado, before being dragged away by a number of Spurs stewards

BassBuds issued a statement via Facebook that condemned the actions of the pitch invaders.

'We have been made aware of an incident at the Tottenham game tonight,' the statement read.

'We are appalled that the game was interrupted in this manner. We do not condone the interruption of any sporting fixture in this way.'

Investigations revealed that all three match tickets for the invaders were bought by the same individual. A fourth ticket was also bought by that person and a member of the crowd who did not make it on the pitch has been identified by the club.

The company, who also have licensing deals with Liverpool, Newcastle, West Ham and Aston Villa, have denied that it was a PR stunt. Spurs will investigate the incident further and could take action against the company if they are found to have links to it. UEFA are expected to charge the club over the breaches in security, with a heavy fine the most likely form of punishment.

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino hit out at the farce and admitted that he was concerned for the safety of his players. The Argentine said: ‘I’m very disappointed with what happened in the first half. The club is aware of the situation.

‘You never know what can happen on the pitch, the behaviour of these people was only to go in and show I don’t know what. I’m very disappointed, for all the club’s supporters that love football, it’s a very strange situation.’

The second pitch invader was eventually stopped by Mousa Dembele, who tripped him up to cut short his time on the Tottenham field

Tottenham issued a statement saying: ‘Three pitch invaders at the match have been arrested and are assisting police with their enquiries.

‘We apologise to fans for the disruptions caused by this totally unacceptable behaviour.’

Shortly before the teams came back out, a tannoy announcement warned supporters at White Hart Lane: ‘Please do not run on the pitch. You will be arrested and banned from future matches. This is a criminal offence and police will prosecute.’

The first invader caught stewards by surprise on 21 minutes, was on the pitch for around two minutes and managed to take three ‘selfie’ photographs with Kyle Naughton, Erik Lamela and Jan Vertonghen, much to the bemusement of players. But it moved beyond a joke when another ran on to the pitch five minutes later and a third followed in the 41st minute.

On Tottenham’s website they posted a competition to win the headphones just three days ago, explaining: ‘The official Tottenham Hotspur BassBuds collection offers Spurs fans a new and exciting way to show your pride for the team wherever you go.’

BassBuds issued a statement via Facebook which read: ‘We have been made aware of an incident at the Tottenham game .We are appalled that the game was interrupted in this manner. We do not condone the interruption of any sporting fixture in this way.’

Opposition manager Marko Nikolic was left stunned by the pitch invasions. ‘Maybe we can hope something like that happen everywhere in the world but not here in England,’ he said. ‘We were a bit surprised, I must say. It was a strange thing to be part of game in England and game stopping three times in one half, then for 10 mins. Maybe that was a little bit disturbing for both sides, for us definitely, but I don’t think it was decisive.’

He added: ‘These strange things are happening around the world and it’s not good for the game. People in UEFA and national federations, government and police who must think about that problem, it’s a big problem.’
