Australian's have been making a splash, with a new study showing that swimming is the most common sporting activity in the country.

The latest National Sports Participation report by Ray Morgan has shown that one in two kids and one in ten adults frequently get their feet wet.

Most fall between the ages of six and 13 with just under half of this group (48.8 percent) participating in swimming regularly.

Soccer was a close second among children between 6 and 13 and third over all of the age groups

Cycling came second overall with nearly 38 percent of 6 to 13 year old children participating

Soccer was a close second for the rate of regular participation with 48.7 percent for six to 13 year old children with cycling second overall with nearly 38 percent of  six to 13 year old children participating.

Overall, with one in seven Australians regularly swimming, one in nine go cycling and one in 12 play soccer.

Children of the ages six to 13 appear to be the most active and 31 percent  participate in athletics, 30 percent in basketball, 30 percent in dancing, 20 percent in tennis and just over 25 percent in cricket.

Hiking, Rugby League, softball, martial arts, volleyball, baseball and field hockey were the least most popular sports among this age group with all of these sports having participation of less than 10 percent. 

There are many more sports for adults such as motorcycle racing and boxing, but walking seems to reign supreme with 45.3 percent of adults regularly walking for exercise.

The gym and weight training is more popular than swimming among adults and jogging overtakes cycling while yoga trumps aerobics.

Team sports move down the list as children get older and individual sports move up, but swimming is the one constant across the board

'10 of the 20 most popular sports and activities among Aussie kids aged six to 13 are team sports,' said Michele Levine, CEO of Roy Morgan Research.

'Soccer is the clear favourite [team sport] with 1.2 million young players across the country.'

Strangely the team sports move down the list as the children get older, with more individual and non-competitive sports moving up.

'Swimming is the one constant,' Michele said.

'[It is] the number one sporting activity for kids and adults with over three million regular participants overall.' 

With over 7000 beaches in the country it is little wonder that parents are finding out whether their kids will sink or swim and educating them about water safety at all ages.
