Dozens of coffin-shaped pits have opened up across a cemetery after weeks of rain caused the earth to give way over burial grounds.

The alarming sinkhole phenomenon, which have exposed around 50 unmarked graves, raised fears deep cavities might be concealed just below the grass.

Visitors are being warned to watch their step after the giant holes appeared at Gravesend Cemetery in Kent.

Collapse: Coffin-shaped holes have been opening up in the cemetery in Gravesend as a result of earth movements

Warning: Visitors have been told to be careful where they step in this Gravesend cemetery after large holes began to open up

Several plots have sunk below ground level following weeks of heavy rain.Â 

Worried cemetery bosses have revealed they have never before seen graves sinking into the ground on such a scale.

A technique known as backfilling has so far failed, as the heavy rain has seen the soil compact down.

Now visitors have been warned to tread carefully - as holes may be lying underneath a mere 'carpet' of grass.

The
 graves, including those at another cemetery in neighbouring Northfleet,
 have been sinking into the ground over the last fortnight.

Unsettling: Heavy rain is being blamed for disturbing the earth and causing graves to collapse in on themselves

Patching up: The local council is busy backfilling the sunken graves with more soil

A Gravesham Council spokesman said: 'It is quite common for graves to sink - especially after a period of heavy rain.

'However none of the current staff has
 seen anything on this scale. Both cemeteries have been affected but 
Northfleet is smaller and has been more manageable.

'There are two main reasons why it has happened.

Urban sinkholes are more common after heavy rain, because they are caused by water flowing through channels below ground and eroding away soil or soft rock like limestone.

As the earth is carried into other parts of the ground large caverns can open up, usually unknown to the authorities or the people living above them.

Once the cavern cannot support the weight of the topsoil above it, it collapses into the ground.

One of the world's largest sinkholes, the Xiaozhai Tiankeng in China, is more than 2,000ft deep.

'One is graves are backfilled with loose soil and they sink again once that soil gets so wet and heavy it compacts.

'One of the first areas that showed a problem had been backfilled three times and needed doing again.

'Secondly in the old section of the cemetery the graves are deeper, so there are larger cavities for the soil to sink into.

'We have been working hard to top up the affected graves using extra staff from other teams.

'It is a gradual process but it is a priority to deal with them.'

Some of the graves have been taped off to keep people away from certain areas.

Families have been visiting the site to check on family members buried there.

A sign warns: 'The ground staff are 
backfilling them as soon as they can, but due to the scale of the 
problem, have had to tape off some areas where the situation is 
particularly bad.

'Please be
 careful when walking on the grass as sometimes the soil has compacted 
but the grass remains like a carpet over the hole.'

The recent spell of torrential rain and storms seems to have caused a spate of serious sinkholes to open up.

Hidden danger: Erosion wearing away at a the earth above loose earth or a cavity is a common cause of sinkholes

Cordoned off: This enormous sinkhole opened up next to a house in South Bedfordshire

Danger zone: This map shows where and when sinkholes have been appearing across Britain over the past few weeks

Three
 houses had to be evacuated after the massive 25ft-wide crater opened up
 in Magdalen's Road, Ripon, North Yorkshire on Tuesday.

The area around the property was cordoned off as engineers prepared to check on the property's safety.

Last
 week a stretch of the M2 in north Kent was closed after a 15ft (4.6m) 
deep hole was discovered in the central reservation, while on February 2
 a teenager's car was swallowed up when a 30ft (9.1m) deep crater 
appeared in a family's driveway in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.

A
 35ft wide sinkhole opened up in a suburban cul-de-sac in Hemel 
Hempstead, Hertfordshire, at 7.30am on February 15, forcing 17 houses to
 be evacuated and leaving one teetering over a 20ft drop.

Two of the houses could have to be demolished.
