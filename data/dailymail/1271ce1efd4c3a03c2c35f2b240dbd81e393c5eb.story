A deranged young man who donned the 
gruesome mask of serial killer from the blood-drenched horror film 'Saw'
to kill his landlady has been sentenced to ten years behind bars.

Fabian Kramer, 19, killed his 
82-year-old landlady wearing the sinister mask out of 'pure murderous 
lust,' according to prosecutors at his trial in the British army 
garrison town of Bielefeld.

He must serve the whole of the 
sentence with no chance of remission from a secure psychiatric unit. If 
he is found to still be unstable at the end of his term, he will stay 
inside, ruled judges.

Guilty: Fabian Kramer, left, has been sentenced to ten years in a secure psychiatric unit after killing his elderly landlady while wearing this mask from the horror film-series Saw

He stabbed his victim Hanna Litz 50 times in her own apartment which was adjacent to his.

They say Kramer wached the 2004 movie 
Saw - about two men who are chained in an underground bathroom and are 
each given instructions via a microcassette recorder on how to escape - 
the night he killed his landlady in March this year.

He rang police after the killing with a fantasy tale about finding her body.

When police arrived Kramer was 
kneeling by the side of his victim pretending he was attempting to save 
her life. "I am an ambulanceman," he lied. "I am just doing my best to 
save her."

Gruesome: The mask was placed upon a tailor's dummy for lawyers to view before it was moved to the well of the court

Evidence: The mask and the kitchen knife (pictured) used to kill his victim were found in his flat in the hours following the attack

But he was soaked in her blood - 
splashes a forensic expert said could only have come from the wounds as 
they occurred - and police suspected him immediately as the killer.

The horror mask along with the kitchen
knife he used to end the life of his victim were found in 
his flat in the hours following the attack.

The mask was flecked also with Mrs. Litz's blood.

He denied murder up until the end and his lawyer pleaded for him to go free. But judges said he was a 'clear menace' to society.
