Arsene Wenger has given his clearest indication yet that he will sign a new deal at Arsenal.

The Frenchman has been at the helm since 1996, but has repeatedly stalled on agreeing a new three-year contract at the club before his current agreement runs out at the end of the season.

But, speaking ahead of Saturday’s Barclays Premier League clash at home against Fulham, Wenger insisted any uncertainty over his future would not complicate Arsenal’s negotiations in the January market.

No news: Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the club are not close to any transfers as the club announced a deal with Huawei as the Official Smartphone Partner, the Arsenal boss is seen here with Mark Mitchinson

Not a fan: Wenger says he would love to scrap the transfer window

He said: ‘There is always a point 
where you have to decide, of course. There is a point where you have to 
decide and there is a point where you have to make your decision public.
 You can take that sentence the way you want it.’

However,
 the Arsenal boss admitted he needed to convince supporters his squad 
could compete again for the highest honours. The capture of £42million 
signing Mesut Ozil last summer, he believes, was crucial in that 
process.

‘People were 
questioning whether I could deliver quality,’ said Wenger. ‘My 
commitment has never been a problem. I am convinced I can.

‘This
 question is not about me, it’s more about “Do people believe Arsenal 
can compete?” The fact we bought Ozil in at top-level money has turned 
belief around.

‘I would 
have loved to (sign a player like Ozil earlier). But I would have loved 
first to keep the players we had. We were not capable of doing that.’

Wenger
 said he is ready to bring in ‘another special player’, but that the 
club are not close to signing Schalke’s Julian Draxler.

There
 were suggestions this week that Draxler, 20, had been spotted at 
Arsenal’s training ground, but Wenger joked: ‘That’s like a 
non-identified flying object. Some see them everywhere.’

The
 Arsenal boss is enjoying life at the top of the table and admitted this
 season has been much easier, psychologically, adding: ‘When you are in 
our position today it is natural motivation and there is incitement to 
go further.’

Meanwhile,
 Arsenal are also looking to secure new deals for defender Per 
Mertesacker and full-back Bacary Sagna, the France international who is 
out of contract in the summer.

Wenger said: 'We are making good progress and hopefully we can announce something soon.'

'Are we close to signing anybody? At the moment I would say no.'

Wenger added: 'The transfer market in January is a low key transfer market.

'There is very reduced activity (generally). There will be some of course, but in the last three days as always.'

Arsenal have also been linked with Fulham forward Dimitar Berbatov.

Wenger said: 'Do I rate Berbatov as player? Highly. Have we made any approach to sign Berbatov? No.

'I
 don't think (we would look to sign Berbatov) because we have (Nicklas) 
Bendtner who is coming back, we have Yaya Sanogo who is making very good
 progress in training.

'Of 
course we have lost Theo Walcott and that for us was a big blow. 
Hopefully we can compensate, but we have not made any approach (for 
Berbatov).'

Targets: Wenger says Arsenal are not close to signing Julian Draxler are unlikely to move for Dimitar Berbatov

Wenger would rather do away with the whole mid-season transfer window.

'You have my signature straight away,' he said.

'Either you scrap it completely, or you leave it open until as long as possible to the last four games.

'It is like running a relay, then in the middle of the relay you change your runners.'

Wenger said: 'It gives teams a chance who are already convicted, it gives some teams hope.

'But when I arrived in England, the window was open until April, the whole season, and it was not a problem.

'Why did you change it? To create that high intense activity and suddenly in January everybody becomes nervous.

'Before it was the whole season and it did not create any problem.'

Czech
 midfielder Thomas Rosicky could play in a protective mask against 
Fulham following surgery to correct a broken nose suffered when he was 
caught by a stray elbow from Gabriel Agbonlahor during the win at Aston 
Villa on Monday night, although full-back Nacho Monreal is doubtful 
after twisting a ligament in his foot.

Arsenal,
 meanwhile, have announced a new multi-million pound commercial tie-up 
with Huawei, which will see the telecommunications specialist become the
 club's official smartphone partner on a global basis until the end of 
the 2015/16 season.
