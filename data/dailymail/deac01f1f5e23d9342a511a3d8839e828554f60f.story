Under fire: BBC Trust finance chief Anthony Fry has rejected a request to hand the emails to MPs and has not read them himself

The BBC is facing pressure from MPs to publish emails that could show the broadcaster gave the opportunity to two of its performers to avoid tax.

The messages came to light in an independent report into the corporation’s tax arrangements late last year following concerns about it paying some individuals through ‘personal service companies’.

A Deloitte review carried out on behalf of the BBC found the broadcaster had taken into account ‘a range of tax outcomes’ for two people who were paid via personal service companies.

It also criticised ‘inconsistency’ in the BBC’s approach to pay.

It pointed out individuals with similar jobs were being paid in three different ways: some as staff, some as freelancers and others via the controversial companies.

The BBC conceded the personal service deals gave ‘greater opportunity’ for avoiding tax and National Insurance payments.

Since the report there has been pressure on the broadcaster to reveal what was in the ‘range of tax outcomes’ emails.

The messages are understood to contain advice from one or more of its tax advisers. It is thought they were sent to BBC managers who were negotiating contracts with presenters.

Conservative MP Richard Bacon, who sits on the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘The issue is one about trust at the end of the day.’ He added: ‘If they have got nothing to hide then why keep them private… they could always redact the names, it is the information people are after.’

In comments to another newspaper he 
added: ‘The emails should also be published because sunlight is the best
disinfectant. Public trust has fallen in the BBC and the best way to 
restore it is to be open.’

Anthony Fry, chairman of the BBC 
Trust’s finance committee, has so far resisted the call to reveal what 
is in the emails. He has also not read the emails in question.

At the end of last year, the BBC said
that more than 100 performers should be added to its books to avoid 
suspicions of tax avoidance. It also said it would move away from its 
policy of employing many of its on-air stars through their own service 
companies.

In the report the BBC had identified 
131 employees – either currently paid via the service companies or on 
freelance contracts – who would be asked to go on the payroll and be 
taxed at source.

Refusal: The BBC paid Deloitte to trawl through the emails and they say they are happy there was nothing of note in them

This could mean stars such as Fiona Bruce and Jeremy Paxman are told to become employees.

There is no suggestion either has used personal service companies to avoid paying tax.

But it emerged that the broadcaster 
faces a bitter battle with high-profile stars over plans to add them to 
the staff payroll. Performers will be subjected to an ‘employment test’ 
to see if they have the ‘characteristics’ of a BBC staff member.

A BBC Trust spokesman said: ‘Tax experts Deloitte were engaged to carry out a comprehensive review.

‘The Trust is satisfied that Deloitte
reviewed everything in the round, including the documents referred to, 
and concluded that there was no evidence of tax avoidance and more 
generally a high level of tax compliance.’
