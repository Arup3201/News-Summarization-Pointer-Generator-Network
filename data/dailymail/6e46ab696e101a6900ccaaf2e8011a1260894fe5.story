It is a tender, natural and intimate portrait which shows, for the first time, something of the personality of young Prince George.

Released on his first Mothering Sunday, this official portrait – in a relaxed style perfectly reflecting the Duke and Duchess’s very modern approach to Royalty – depicts the eight-month-old as a curious, affectionate toddler, gazing into the eyes of the family’s beloved Lupo.

George seems devoted to the cocker spaniel and, judging by the adoration on Lupo’s face, the sentiments are returned.

Meanwhile, his parents look naturally and
 happily into the camera’s lens. What matters more, however, is that 
they are letting the public gaze in.

Never before has a Royal portrait beckoned to an audience with quite the same promise of effortless informality. 

In
 the shot, taken by award-winning photographer Jason Bell at a window of
 the Cambridges’ home, Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, Kate looks 
radiant in the fresh sunshine of spring.

William appears more mature, 
his boyish looks replaced by a new heft, reflecting perhaps both 
fatherhood and his growing stature in the Royal tableau.

Christening: The Duke of Cambridge holds three-month-old Prince George at Chapel Royal in St James's Palace. As he has grown, the young heir has developed an increasingly striking resemblance to other male members of the Royal Family 

The
 last time George was officially pictured, also by Bell, he was asleep 
in a bouffant of creamy ruffles – the historic Honiton lace gown worn by
 all Royal babies – at his christening last October.

Prince George’s personalised jumper is believed to be a bespoke design, created especially for the young Royal.

The
 unique powder blue design is understood to have been machine made using
 the finest 100 per cent cashmere yarn, much like the material favoured 
by Royal favourite Johnstons of Elgin.

The family-run woollen mill, which is based in Elgin, Scotland, currently holds the Royal Warrant for Prince Charles.

There are however alternative options.

Here, he is a 
proper little boy with a fluff of brown hair, his mother’s dark eyebrows
 and a very cool jumper which could make him a junior style icon.

Think
 back to Prince William at that age, clad in pastel romper suits and 
lace-trimmed tops.

Back then, William was dressed as a Royal baby, a 
little Prince. George, as his cute pale blue woolly clearly says, is 
just George.

Cool modernity 
with an undertow of nostalgia is the spirit of the picture. But it is 
its unusual and rather daring technical details which make it the most 
defining image of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since their wedding 
three years ago.

The 
washed-out tones seem designed to appeal simultaneously to two very 
different generations. There’s probably not a family in the land which 
does not have a similarly faded shot curling in the back of an old 
photograph album, a picture of Mum and Dad back at the start of married 
life.

And there will not be a hipster twenty or thirty-something couple 
who haven’t attempted to recreate that very shot for themselves using a 
carefully chosen filter on Instagram.

But
 the message of the image itself is that the Cambridges are one happy, 
confident family, keen to stay connected to the nation, while belonging 
more than anything to each other.
