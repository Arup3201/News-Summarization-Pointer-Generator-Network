For many teenagers, being told NOT to eat fruit and vegetables would be welcome news.

But Chrissie Roberts, now 22, was devastated when she was told she could no longer tuck into the fresh produce after developing a bizarre allergy.

The student developed a bizarre allergy to fruit at her boarding school when she was 15-years-old.

Allergic: If Chrissie ate the fruit she is pictured holding her throat would close up and she would suffocate

Now at university, Chrissie must take a cocktail of vitamins to compensate for the lack of nutrition in her diet.

She wants to raise awareness for others about her rare condition which also means she has to avoid many cosmetics and fruit-based shampoos.

Experts diagnosed Chrissie with 'oral allergy syndrome', which is made up from a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth to fresh fruits and vegetables. It typically develops in hay fever sufferers but can improve in later life.

The former public schoolgirl was boarding at Trinity School, inDevon, when she experienced her first reaction.

Miss Roberts said: 'We used to get melon every day during break times.

'One day I was messing around with my friends and I put my whole face into the fruit.

'After about 10 minutes I had a red raw rash on my face and my throat began closing up.

'I love melon and I tried to eat it again but the reaction was even moreextreme the second time so I knew I must be allergic.

'After that I started having reactions to all fruit and some vegetables. It gotso bad that I was forced to cut it out of my diet completely.

'People accused me of making it up and said I was a fussy eater orthat I was just doing it for attention.

'But nothing could be further from the truth. You've got no idea how hard it is to avoid eating or coming into contact with fruit.

'I have to take it really seriously. When it happens my airways close up andI've been told I could suffocate to death if I left it untreated.'

Chrissie not only has to keep an eagle eye out for fruit within other foods but has to check cosmetic products.

She told how an innocent sleep over turned into a nightmare when sheexperimented with a new hair conditioner.

She said: 'I was having a girly night in with my friend Harriet and we decided to use this new hair treatment she bought that's meant to repair split ends.

'After a few minutes I felt this burning sensation on my back and I had redwelts where the conditioner had dripped off my hair.

'I ran screaming into the shower and managed to get it all rinsed off.When I read the packaging I saw it had avocado in it. I though 'oh greatanother thing I can't eat'.'

Awareness: Chrissie wants to highlight oral allergy syndrome

Chrissie's mother Michelle and stepfather Kevin, from Wells, in Somerset, are both pharmacists and make sure she is fully equipped with antihistamines for whenever she goes back to university.

Currently studying animation at Camborne University in Cornwall Chrissie joked that she's not all that different from everyday students.

Chrissie said: 'Most my friends are pretty much on a fruit free diet anyway so I don't notice that I can't have it most of the time.

'But I do miss eating it. It's ironic because I was really healthy before thishappened and I always made sure I had my five a day.'

A spokeswoman from Allergy UK said: 'Fresh fruit and vegetables are common causes of an unusual condition called oral allergy syndrome.

'Oral allergy syndrome is the medical term for an allergic reaction to foodwhich is limited to the lips, mouth and throat.

'Those who suffer with seasonal allergic rhinitis or 'hay fever' are more than likely to suffer, as it has been shown that pollens from trees (especially Birch), grasses and weeds contain proteins of similar structure to those present in certain fruit, vegetables, nuts and spices.

'These proteins are recognised by the immune system of a person with hay fever and can trigger an allergic reaction in a susceptible person when they eat a food which shares the same protein as the pollen.

'If you have oral allergy symptoms, it is important that you are referred to an allergy specialist. This will ensure that you have a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

'Avoidance of the foods that cause your reactions is most important. Usually, cooking will destroy the allergens so that you need not worry about cooked food.'
