Radio comedy star Sandi Toksvig paid an emotional tribute to the love of her life today – after taking advantage of new rules allowing gay couples to convert their civil partnerships into marriages.

Sandi said she would marry her partner Debbie ‘every day’ if she could and praised the new marriage rules which she said stopped gay couples being treated as ‘second class’ citizens.

Their wedding today came as tens of thousands of gay couples were given the right to convert their civil partnerships into marriages from today.

Sandi and Debbie converted their civil partnerships into marriage this afternoon. Sandi said she would marry Debbie 'every day' if she could

Sandi said: ‘It's about being exactly the same as everyone else. I have campaigned for years and years and years and been through all sorts of things - death threats and all the unpleasantness - and all we're saying is we love each other, and it's the same as any two consenting adults.

‘I'd marry her every day if I could.’

She added: ‘I do have a confession to make, which is that I do not love Debbie as much today as I will tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will love her even more. Every day, it just gets better and better.’

Fashion entrepreneur Mary Portas was one of the first couples in the UK to convert their civil partnership to a same-sex marriage.

The conversion took place at Westminster City Hall in London at 12.01am today, one minute after the law came into effect.

Westminster superintendent registrar Alison Cathcart presided over the conversion of Ms Portas and fashion journalist Melanie Rickey's civil partnership, and said she saw it as the ‘final step in equality for gay marriage’ and Westminster City Hall was ‘very proud to play our part in it’.

Ms Portas described the occasion as ‘absolutely magical’ and said she had been planning it for about a month.

She said: ‘We have three children together and there is such a deep rooted commitment to being married, it just felt right.

‘Our last ceremony was very different, with a much wider extension of friends and family.’

Ms Rickey said: ‘I thought we were out looking for art galleries but when we started driving up and down the same street a couple of times I started getting a bit suspicious.

‘When we turned up outside Westminster City Hall I guessed what was going on.

‘I couldn't think of a better surprise.’

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who is also equalities minister, and skills minister Nick Boles, who is responsible for policy over same sex marriage, hailed a ‘proud’ moment for equal rights.

Mr Boles, who is gay, has said his own civil partner has ‘somewhat insistently’ pushed for their right to convert to a marriage.

The coalition government passed laws enabling same sex marriage in civil venues in England and Wales last year, angering some traditional Conservative supporters.

However, some gay couples who had entered into the civil partnerships legalised by the last Labour government protested that they were discriminated against because they could not become married couples.

Mrs Morgan and Mr Boles, writing for the PinkNews website, said the law is being changed from today to allow such couples to convert to a marriage.

‘We are absolutely delighted to be delivering on our promise to allow these conversions by Christmas and we are especially proud to be able to say, as of today, there is no reason in law why anyone cannot marry the person they love just because of their gender,’ they said. 

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the change in the law which means from today gay couples can convert their civil partnerships into marriages

Mrs Morgan originally voted against a bill to legalise same sex unions last year. But announcing her view had changed on the issue in October, she told critics in the Commons: ‘If you are not going to recognise that people actually change their minds then what is the point of this place and this House of democracy and debate?’ 

Recent polls show that a majority of Conservative and Ukip supporters are in favour of gay marriage.

A study by Ipsos MORI found that 61 per cent of would-be Tory voters and 54 per cent who intend to vote for the UK Independence Party support same-sex unions.

Overall, almost seven in 10 Britons – 69 per cent – believe that homosexual couples should be able to marry while just over a quarter – 28 per cent – disagree.

When the same question was asked in 1975, support for gay marriage stood at just 16 per cent, with 53 per cent against.

Ten same-sex couples also made history in Brighton and Hove as they simultaneously converted their civil unions.

Ten registrars took the couples through the administrative process simultaneously in separate offices at Brighton Town Hall at 10am and all the couples were given a commemorative certificate to mark their involvement in the day's celebration.

Ian Scott, 70, and Ron Williams, 82, from Hove, whose civil partnership took place in January 2006, were among the couples taking part today.

When they met and fell in love in 1962 homosexuality was still illegal and the couple said they never thought they would see the day when they could be legally married.

Mr Williams said: ‘It's a very good feeling and we are very happy that we have been able to do this. We have waited 52 years.’

John Azzopardi, 39, and Aaron Burns, 38, from Hove, also took part in the conversion at 10am.

Mr Azzopardi said: ‘It's a really important step for same-sex couples as it is about our marriage being equal under the law. It is important for all same-sex couples to have the same equality if they want it.’

Linda Holm, superintendent registrar, said about 150 couples had already booked to convert their civil partnerships into marriages and that following this morning's conversions, another six or seven would be taking place at the town hall today.

She said: ‘The atmosphere has been great, really positive and exciting.

For those couples that have been through the process this morning it has been life-changing. It's a great privilege to be part of that and to help them through the legal process.’

The Marriage Act came into effect on March 29 but there was no legal way for couples in civil partnerships to be married until Parliament moved to amend the law.

Couples wishing to convert their civil partnerships will have the choice of a simple process at a register office or a two-stage process, where a registrar can complete the conversion at another venue meaning the couple's family and friends can attend.

The conversion can take place at premises which have been registered for the marriage of same-sex couples - such as hotels, stately homes and religious premises.

For the first year, all couples who formed their civil partnership before March 29 (when same-sex marriage was introduced) will be able to receive a £45 fee reduction.
