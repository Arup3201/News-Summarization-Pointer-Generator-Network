Nothing says Christmas like sending a cheesy family photo to your relatives to show how much everyone has grown.

Never one to miss a trick, the nation’s politicians have jumped on the bandwagon and are using social media to send their messages of seasonal cheer along with some frankly ridiculous photos of their growing broods.

This Christmas has seen some impressively awful examples of these cheery seasonal photos with the Romneys and the Pelosis seemingly competing to see who can fit the most relatives into a photo.

The Obama family haven't released an official family portrait since 2011 but this cute photo taken earlier this month along with some children dressed as elves is a worthy stand-in

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sent a seasonal note to her supporters this year plus a message explaining that the photo was taken at a family gathering to celebrate the California Democrat's 50th wedding anniversary with husband Paul.

The Romney’s Christmas photo includes even more people and includes Mitt, Ann and almost all of their 22 grandchildren. It looks like it would have been a very noisy and chaotic photo shoot to try and organize.

Keeping things a bit more orderly are the Bush family. George W has posted a photo of him, wife Laura, daughters Jenna and Barbra, plus Jenna’s husband Henry Chase Hayer and their daughter Mila. The photo was taken on Christmas Eve service at Prairie Chapel Ranch in Texas

One family which haven’t issued an official photo this Christmas is the Obamas.

Traditionally they’ve released an official portrait of the First Family every two years, but one is seemingly overdue as the last one was issued in 2011.

For their first White House Christmas in 2009, Annie Leibovitz shot the family with the girls casually draping their arms over their adoring parents.

Then in 2011, official White House photographer Pete Souza did the honors for the navy-and-purple themed shot.

Seated on a beige couch in the Oval Office, the parents grasped their daughters' hands tightly and Sasha was still young enough to sit on her father's knee.

The closest the Obamas have got to a festive family photo this year was at a Washington charity event earlier this month when some little Christmas elves entertained them with their mischievous antics.

During the photo op at the Christmas In Washington concert, the president and his family were in stitches as some young patients from the Children's National Medical Center made hilarious faces at the camera.

The Obamas met five of the hospital's young patients, who stole the spotlight dressed as elves.

The Clintons haven’t indulged in any such shenanigans but Hillary is seeking charitable donations with a one-week special offer.

She says her husband and former president Bill Clinton will personally match any donation made to the Clinton Foundation through Dec. 31.

The former secretary of state and possible 2016 presidential candidate tells supporters in an e-mail that the Clintons have big plans for their non-profit foundation 2014.

She specifically mentioned programs that help preschoolers, young job-seekers, and women and girls ‘in every aspect of our society.’
