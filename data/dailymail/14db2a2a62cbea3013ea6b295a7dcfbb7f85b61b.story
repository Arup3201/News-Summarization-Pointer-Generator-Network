Broadcaster Andrew Marr has revealed his major stroke has left him unable to type.

The BBC presenter today made his first appearance at a public event since the serious stroke in January this year which damaged his left arm and leg, leaving him needing intensive physiotherapy.

But as he prepares to return to the airwaves next month grilling Britain’s top politicians, the former newspaper journalist disclosed the progress he has made on the road to recovery.

Return: Broadcaster Andrew Marr made his first appearance at public event since suffering a major stroke at the Edinburgh International Book Festival

Recovery: The 53-year-old author revealed his revised version of his book The Battle For Scotland had to be updated using a dictation machine because he had been left unable to type

Marr, 53, was rushed to hospital after being taken unwell seven months ago.

Doctors warned his wife, journalist Jackie Ashley, he might not survive the bleeding in his brain and that if he lived he could be left unable to move, see, speak or hear.

Following months of rehabilitation, he is now preparing to return to broadcasting full-time next month.

But speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, he said he was still unable to perform some basic tasks.

He said: ‘I can't type because my left arm is still no good. I used to touch-type but I can't any more. I used to think I could only think through my fingers.’

Physio: The serious stroke in January damaged Marr's left arm and leg, and means he has to walk with a stick

He said a revised version of his 1992 book The Battle For Scotland had been updated using a dictation machine.

Marr, the corporation's former political editor, began his career as a newspaper reporter, becoming the editor of The Independent before turning to television.

He has also presented a number of history programmes along with his politics show and has had five books published.

He has previously blamed a combination of overwork and excessive exercise for his stroke.

‘I had a major stroke, I'm frankly lucky to be alive. I had been heavily overworking - mostly my own fault - in the year before that,’ he said in April.

He is due to return to full-time presenting this autumn, taking up the helm again on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show from September 1 and is also returning to Radio 4's Start The Week.

Grilling: Marr has been off TV screens since being taken ill in January, but did record an interview with Prime Minister David Cameron in June

Marr worked to update his book on Scottish politics ahead of next year's referendum on independence.

He predicted it would be '"much closer than the polls suggest' and there was still a 'lot to play for'.

But he admitted there was a 'very strong anti-English feeling' in Scotland, adding: 'I don't think it is particularly serious most of the time, but it can become serious, it can become toxic.'

He hailed Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond as 'some kind of political genius' but after being in power for some time is now 'struggling with the gilt rubbing off a little bit'.

The Glasgow-born journalist also revealed he would choose a Scottish passport should Scotland vote yes next year. 'I am a Scot, so it would have to be a Scottish passport and not an English passport,' he said.
