These were the horrific injuries suffered by a pensioner after he was beaten in a 'cowardly and unprovoked attack' by a serving soldier who had just returned from Afghanistan.

Gordon Glynn, 84, was left bleeding, bruised and needing 14 stitches after Joseph Dickinson knocked him off his chair and punched him.

Defending his actions, the 21-year-old said he only carried out the attack to stop him from 'smacking' his own father, with whom he was furious.

Dickinson had only returned from Afghanistan two days earlier and it was later found the soldier had been suffering from partial post-traumatic stress disorder.

However, this did not stop a judge from jailing him for a year at Warrington Crown Court.

Mr Glynn had been enjoying a quiet pint with friends at the Pack Horse Inn, Culcheth, Cheshire, a few days before Christmas last year when he was punched twice and knocked off his seat by Dickinson.

The member of the Army Air Corps fled the pub and was only tracked down by police after sending texts to a friend telling her ‘not to grass him up’.

Oliver King, prosecuting, said: 'The texts said he had smacked someone and he didn’t know his name but it was either that or he smacked his dad.

'Mr Glynn was the closest person to him which was why he lashed out at him.'

Judge Roger Dutton said during the sentencing at Warrington Crown Court (pictured) that the soldier had 'difficulties controlling his temper'

Mr Glynn spent two days in hospital and was in so much pain he was unable to eat his Christmas dinner or wear his glasses to watch TV and read.

Dickinson, who was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in October 2010, had the role of protecting the Queen in 2009 when he was involved with the Changing of the Guard outside Buckingham Palace.

Michael Davies, defending, said psychological reports found Dickinson had partial post-traumatic stress disorder.

'The defendant is genuinely shocked and appalled at what he did that night'

He added: 'The defendant is genuinely shocked and appalled at what he did that night. He was horrified when he saw the pictures and was choking back the tears.

'His dad said there was a mist in his eyes and he had been a changed person since he had come back from Afghanistan.'

Judge Roger Dutton said he had given him credit because he was a soldier but it was clear he had ‘difficulties controlling his temper’.

He added: 'The career you have chosen exposed you to risks and danger but the severity of the attack and random nature means I can’t suspend the sentence.'

Dickinson sobbed as he was jailed for 12 months.

Detective Constable Matt Gagen of Cheshire Police said: 'This was an unprovoked and cowardly attack against an 84-year-old man who was out enjoying a Christmas drink.

'The people of Warrington cannot fail to be appalled by the offender’s actions, targeting a man four times his age, when he is supposed to be a disciplined member of the Armed Forces.

'My thanks go to 1 Regiment Army Air Corps (Germany) who have supported the investigation and my admiration goes to the victim who has shown great character and fortitude to carry on as normal.'
