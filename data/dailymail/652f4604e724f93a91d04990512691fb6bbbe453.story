A 26-year-old man who was caught bashing another man on video in Canberra has dodged prison time.

The moment Ben Burnell punched and kicked a man in the head until he passed out in Civic in Canberra's inner city was recorded on CCTV.

Prosecutors told ACT Magistrates Court that the July attack was 'short but sustained and very vicious', according to the ABC.

Magistrate Peter Dingwell said the assault launched by Burnell, from Canberra, was a serious offence and was a knee jerk reaction to comment made about a hair do.

'The reason he committed the offence remains a mystery,' Mr Dingwell said.

'It was a somewhat spur of the moment action, a disproportionate response to a jocular remark.'

The magistrate said he believed Burnell regretted his actions because he had entered a guilty plea, and due to his age and his previous criminal history, he did not think prison was an suitable punishment.

The court had previously heard from Burnell's lawyer that the defendant would like to pursue youth work and pushed for a conviction not to be recorded.

Lawyer James Maher said Burnell would be required to undergo a background check for work and a conviction would make it more difficult for him to pass one.

But Mr Dingwell knocked back the suggestion as the assault 'was a prolonged and serious assault on a defenceless man'.

Burnell was given a 12-month good behaviour order and required to perform 80 hours of community service.
