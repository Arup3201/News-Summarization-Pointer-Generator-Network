Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned - that is what an Illinois man learned the hard way after his ex-girlfriend allegedly tried to poison and electrocute him as payback for throwing her out of his house.

Amanda Pollard, 28, of Perkin, has been arrested and charged with unlawful tampering of food, trespassing and criminal damage to property. She was ordered held on $50,000 bond last Friday.

Pollard's former paramour, 33-year-old Joshua Brewster, told police that a friend who stopped by his house caught the woman booby-trapping his bed after spreading poison in the kitchen and sabotaging a personal care product.

Man-cave: Brewster called police to help evict Pollard from his home on Catherine Street in Perkin, Illinois

'Payback's a b***h,' Pollard reportedly told Brewster's friend.

It all started December 1 when Brewster, the owner of a local landscaping business, called police to evict Pollard from his home in the 300 block Catherine Street in Perkin.

The following day, the 33-year-old homeowner invited Pollard to stop by and pick up her belongings, but once there, the woman threatened to burn down his house with him in it, according to a police report cited by Perkin Daily Times.

Sensing that Pollard might be up to something, Brewster asked a friend to check up on his house while he was at work the next day.

The friend walked in on Pollard cutting the cord from an electric blanket, which she then slipped under the mattress in the hope of electrocuting Brewster.

The jilted loved allegedly informed the friend that she had placed rat poison pellets in Brewster's coffee container and cereal, and urinated in his mouthwash.

Fleeting happiness: Less than a week before the incident, Pollard gushed on her Facebook page about how happy she was

When questioned by police, Pollard, who has a young son and daughter from a previous relationship, confessed to poisoning her former lover's coffee, but denied the other acts of sabotage.

The woman, who wrote on her Facebook page just days before the incident, ' Im SOOOOO happy:)', told police that she felt 'hurt and angry' over the unceremonious eviction.
