Kevin Pietersen will make his NatWest T20 Blast debut against Essex.

Surrey were hoping Pietersen could begin his campaign last week, in their London derby against Middlesex at the Kia Oval.

The finger injury which troubled him during the Indian Premier League stopped the former England batsman playing last Friday. But a week on, he will be in action at home to Essex.

County action: Kevin Pietersen will return to action for Surrey in the Natwest T20 Blast match with Essex at the Kia Oval on Friday

Apparent confirmation came in the form of a Tweet on the NatWest T20 Blast feed, which read: 'NEWS: Kevin Pietersen named in @surreycricket squad, set for T20Blast action at the Oval on Friday.'

A youtube video posted on Twitter by Surrey - featuring Pietersen padding up in the dressing room - was accompanied by the words: 'This gentleman will be coming to work on Friday night @KP24'

Meanwhile, Pietersen appeared to express some regret that he will not be in the England team for the first Test against Sri Lanka at Lord's next week.

He posted on his Twitter account: 'England selectors meeting today... I'm ready to go! Fancy Lords next week...I'm a number 4 batter & bowl off spin #KPforLords' followed by an emoticon of crying eyes.

Regrets? Pietersen tweeted this ahead of the start of the Sri Lanka Test series next week
