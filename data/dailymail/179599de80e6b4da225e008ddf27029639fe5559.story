Borussia Dortmund's nightmarish start to the Bundesliga season continues. After eight games, the Champions League finalists of 2013 have notched up a mere seven points, and conceded fourteen goals. Defeat to newly promoted Cologne on Saturday meant that they were unable to haul themselves off a miserable 14th place in the table.

No wonder Jurgen Klopp looks more exasperated with each passing weekend. Neither the charming sense of humour nor the defiant bursts of anger are anywhere to be seen at the moment. Klopp simply looks at a loss.

'We're playing a kind of football which doesn't make any sense. Our passing is dreadful, we're making simple mistakes. There are various explanations for it,' he said after the defeat to Cologne.

Those explanations are difficult to identify, though. It would be easy to think that it was a personnel issue. Dortmund have lost Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski to Bayern Munich in the last 18 months, and players like Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan and Henrikh Mkhitaryan are only just returning from injuries.

Gundogan aside, however, the absentees are all forwards. Dortmund's problems are not in their attacking play, where new signings Ciro Immobile, Adrian Ramos and Shinji Kagawa have proved themselves to be reasonable replacements. It is in defence that Klopp's team are becoming a laughing stock.

'We're constantly creating chances, and most of the time we're converting chances. That's usually enough to win games,' said Klopp.

He is right. Dortmund's defence has been an eight-episode comedy box set of errors this season, complete with sloppy passing, dreadful positioning and embarrassing individual mistakes. The defence has not been overrun by superior opposition, it has gifted goals to significantly weaker teams like Hamburg, Mainz, Stuttgart and most recently Cologne.

That last defeat sparked an angry response from director of sport Michael Zorc. 'We're seeing serious slip-ups from players who are supposedly leaders,' he ranted. It was quite clear to whom he was referring. Mats Hummels, newly crowned captain and target of many a Premier League club, has failed catastrophically to organise a coherent back line this season.

It isn't just Hummels, of course. As Klopp says, the whole team has a problem at the moment. The coach has taken primary responsibility, but insists he is staying in his job: 'If I thought for a moment that I was somehow the thing disturbing the team, I would say, "thanks guys, it's been great, but my time's up". But I don't think that.'

Klopp is certainly in no danger from above. His success with the club over the last few years means he has a lot more breathing space than most coaches, and rightly so. Even the media are not on his back. One opinion piece in WAZ even said that Dortmund 'can be relaxed, even in crisis'.

There are also some positives to be taken from the Champions League. Dortmund top their group after two games, and look an altogether different team when playing in Europe, as Arsenal found to their dismay last month. A victory over Galatasary on Wednesday would be exactly the kind of thing Klopp's side are in need of. A confidence boost, but also a reminder that if they are going to be playing in the same competition next season, they had better get their act together in the Bundesliga.
