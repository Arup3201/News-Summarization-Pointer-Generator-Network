BBC Radio DJ Liz Kershaw is to lift the lid on the culture of sexual harassment at Radio 1 after sensationally revealing she was groped while broadcasting live for the station.

Kershaw, 54, has been asked  to meet with George Entwistle, the corporation’s new director-general, after she told yesterday’s Today programme that a male colleague had repeatedly ‘fondled her breasts’ while she was on air. 

In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, the BBC Radio 6 Music presenter said she would name male contemporaries who had sex with Radio 1 and  Top Of The Pops fans as well as junior colleagues.

'Sexual antics': Liz Kershaw has said she will name male contemporaries who had sex with Radio 1 and Top Of The Pops fans

Sources say this information  is likely to include details of  an ‘unsuitable relationship’ involving the late John Peel and  a schoolgirl now in her 40s.

Kershaw said: ‘I will be seeing Mr Entwistle and I will be telling him everything that I know.

‘I have been asked to see him because of the comments I made on Radio 4 yesterday.

‘I will be telling him about the sexual antics of other household names who had relationships with girls in the office or with people they met on Top Of The Pops or the Radio 1 show.

‘I should stress, however, those relationships did not involve underage girls.’

Liz Kershaw said Jimmy Savile's penchant for young girls was an 'open secret' at BBC Radio 1

Kershaw last night refused to identify any of the personalities involved and insisted her primary motive was to help  the BBC following the wave of allegations about Jimmy Savile’s relationships with young girls.

‘I love the BBC and I want George Entwistle to be prepared for anything that might be coming, because it will come out. I think it’s best he hears it from someone who was on the spot.’

When the Today programme producers called her yesterday, Kershaw told them Savile’s penchant for young girls was  an open secret at Radio 1.

She joined the station shortly after his departure but said colleagues constantly joked about the relationships.

She said: ‘The rumours were there, the jokes were there and  it was an open secret.

‘With all the piety about him when he died last year I was rather sickened, and I thought “why don’t people say what he was really like”. The main jokes were about his adventures on the Radio 1 roadshow when they went around the country.

‘It was massive then. It was rather like the X Factor going around the country then. Can you imagine the X Factor judges rounding up the contestants and asking for sexual favours after the show? I don’t think so.’

Kershaw also revealed she was repeatedly groped by a colleague.

She said: ‘There was one presenter who routinely groped me. I would be sitting in the studio with my headphones on and my back to the studio door.  I couldn’t hear a thing . . . then I’d find these wandering hands up my jumper, fondling my breasts.

‘I couldn’t say anything, I couldn’t even explain because  I was broadcasting to the nation.’Kershaw said her complaints to BBC managers fell on deaf ears.

‘When I complained, they were incredulous and said “Don’t you like it? Are you a lesbian?”Kershaw added: ‘When I walked into Radio 1, it was a culture I had never encountered before. It was like walking into a rugby club locker room, and it was very intimidating for a young woman.’
