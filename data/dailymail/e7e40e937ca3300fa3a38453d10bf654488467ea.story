For obvious reasons, the chances of one sport completing a clean sweep of the main prizes at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards are slim indeed.

But, as the panel comprising sports stars, sports editors and BBC bigwigs prepares to convene to set the ball rolling ahead of the big announcements on December 14, let’s put the case for golf breaking the mould and completing this particular triple crown.

Let’s start with Team of the Year. Did anyone put in a performance that came close to Europe’s steamrollering of the Americans in the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September?

It’s not easy dealing with great expectation. Just ask England’s footballers. But Europe’s team delivered to a man to trigger a post-mortem in America that still rages.

You can understand their angst. How does a nation with such a strong college golf system and the most glamorous tour in the world keep losing? But doesn’t that underline the scale of Europe’s achievement?

For Coach of the Year, it surely has to be Paul McGinley. For two years, the Irishman poured everything he had into the role of Europe’s captain.

Never mind not leaving any stones unturned; McGinley never left any grains of sand unturned.

Regarding that heavy burden of expectation, what an inspired move it was to seek the counsel of Sir Alex Ferguson, the man who dealt so brilliantly with it all his working life.

That was just one of many moves which made McGinley the best Ryder Cup captain since Tony Jacklin.

And so to the main award itself, the one decided on the night by the viewers. Since it began in 1954, only two golfers have won it — Dai Rees, for captaining Britain and Ireland to victory in the Ryder Cup in 1957 and Sir Nick Faldo for winning his first Masters in 1989.

A quarter-century on, the case for a third is so overwhelming it would, quite frankly, damage the credibility of the award if Rory McIlroy didn’t win it.

Lewis Hamilton is his only conceivable rival and, no doubt, the motor racing fraternity will lobby as powerfully as ever.

But let’s be honest. If Hamilton was in any other car but a Mercedes he wouldn’t be close to claiming F1’s main prize. He’s effectively winning a two-car race.

McIlroy has put together the greatest season in the history of European golf. 

Rory McIlroy has put together the greatest season in the history of European golf.

Even Faldo’s best season didn’t come close.

The Northern Irishman didn’t just win two majors, he won the European Tour’s flagship event plus one of the four WGC events that sit one rung below the majors.

There was also a singles display at the Ryder Cup so good it had some of the nation’s leading sportswriters comparing him to other superstars who transcend their game, like Messi and Ronaldo.

A clean sweep for one sport? Admittedly, it is asking an awful lot.

But then this was the year our golfers delivered an awful lot.

A rare duff shot by Garcia

Given how good it has been to see him play with a smile on his face again this year, it is with a heavy heart that I take Sergio Garcia to task.

But the fact is, he let European golf down badly last week.

The first event of the four-tournament Final Series to conclude the season sees lots of money at stake in Shanghai courtesy of loyal sponsor BMW.

Sergio Garcia sent out wrong message by snubbing Shanghai for Malaysia

Garcia has a golden chance to close the gap on Rory McIlroy, the man leading the Race to Dubai, who has been detained in Ireland by his lawyers.

So what does Garcia do? The Spaniard decides to play in the PGA Tour event in Malaysia instead.

Yes, I’m sure the appearance money was good. But did he not stop for a minute to think what sort of message this sends out?

How are the rest of us supposed to get interested in the Final Series concept if the No 2 can’t be bothered to show up?

Just to complete BMW’s week, the tournament was won by Marcel Siem — sponsored by Mercedes.

On the European Tour website, full marks for creativity to the photographer who got Siem to hold the trophy at just the right angle to block out the massive Mercedes logo on the German’s shirt.

Quote of the week

‘For some weird reason, I had this gut feeling I may make another one. When I saw the ball land and kick towards the hole, I thought, “Wow, this is actually going to happen”.’

One week after winning a £40,000 Buick for a hole in one in China, LPGA Tour player Danielle Kang (above) travelled to Taiwan, where she won a £40,000 Audi following another ace.

In case you were wondering, the odds on that happening on designated holes in successive tournaments have been calculated at over 500,000-1.
