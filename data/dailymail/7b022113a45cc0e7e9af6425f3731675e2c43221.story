First lady Michelle Obama opposes military action in Syria, President Barack Obama revealed in a series of interviews on Monday.

'You know, if you talk to my own family members, or Michelle's, you know, they're very wary and suspicious of any action,' Obama told PBS.

In a separate interview with NBC he added, 'If you ask Michelle, "Do we want to be involved in another war?" The answer is no.'

President Obama said Monday that he would prefer to find a diplomatic solution to the Syrian chemical weapons crisis

Obama made the remarks in interviews with six major television networks in which he acknowledged the lack of public support for a missile strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad as punishment for Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons.

The first lady has not spoken out publicly on the situation in Syria.

After noting her opposition to military intervention in the NBC interview, Obama continued: 'And so I recognize how important that debate is and it’s my belief that for me, the president, to act without consensus in a situation where there’s not a direct, imminent threat to the homeland or our interests around the world, that that’s not the kind of precedent I want to set.'

Obama was expected to make the the case for military intervention in Syria during the interviews, but instead he revealed that he's considering a softer approach to the conflict.

'It's fair to say I haven't decided' whether to bomb Syria if Congress doesn't vote to authorize it, Obama told NBC's Savannah Guthrie when her turn came in the White House's Blue Room

Assad insists that the White House doesn't have ironclad evidence that his government used chemical weapons, and said Obama is leading a 'social media administration'

After his administration had spent several days trying to drum up support for strikes, Obama disclosed that he has been secretly discussing a non-military resolution with Russian President Vladimir Putin 'for quite some time.'

'We will pursue this diplomatic track,' Obama told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, referring to Putin's call for Assad to surrender his chemical weapons stockpile to international control. 'I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non-military way.'
