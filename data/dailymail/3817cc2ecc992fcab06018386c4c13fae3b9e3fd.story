Labour today called for a Downing Street inquiry into the influence of lobbyist Lynton Crosby over government moves to abandon plans for plain cigarette packaging.

Ed Miliband accused David Cameron of ‘caving in to big tobacco’ after it emerged Tory election guru Mr Crosby also advises tobacco giant Philip Morris.

Pressure has mounted on the Prime Minister since Mr Crosby was hired by the Conservatives to spearhead his bid for re-election in 2015.

The row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions after the coalition shelved plans to follow Australia in forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets.

Asked if he had discussed plain cigarette packaging with Mr Crosby, whose clients include tobacco giant Philip Morris, Mr Cameron said: ‘He has never lobbied me on anything.’

But Mr Miliband accused him of using ‘weasel words’ and added: ‘He can't deny that he had a conversation with Lynton Crosby about this issue. Even by the standards of this Prime Minister this is a disgraceful episode.’

The Labour party is writing to Labour to Downing Street to demand an inquiry into whether Mr Cameron has breached the ministers' code of conduct.

The code states that ministers ‘must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise’.

The row overshadowed the publication of legislation which would force lobbyists to publicly state who their clients are.

Labour
also found itself embroiled in the tobacco lobbying scandal after it 
emerged James Barge, a former aide to Mr Miliband, left the party to 
join Philip Morris International as a Corporate Affairs Manager.

Tory MP Julian Smith today wrote to Mr Miliband to ask if he had ever been lobbied by Mr Barge.

'Clearly it is important to ensure that politicians act with the utmost transparency when it comes to lobbying,' Mr Smith said.

In the Commons Mr Miliband told Mr Cameron: 'You are the Prime Minister for Benson and Hedgefunds and you know it.

'Can't you see that there is a devastating conflict of interest between having your key adviser raking it in from big tobacco and then advising you not to go ahead with plain packaging?’

Devastating: Labour leader Ed Miliband said there was a clear conflict of interest between Mr Crosby's work as an adviser to tobacco firms and the government's decision to shelve plain cigarette packets

But Mr Cameron said if Mr Miliband wanted a ‘lobbying scandal’ he should look at his own party: ‘The trade unions buy his policies, buy his candidates, they even bought and paid for his leadership.’

He added: ‘This Government is doing something that they never did for 13 years and that is publishing a lobbying Bill.

‘Let us remember why we need a lobbying Bill: we had former Labour ministers who described themselves as cabs for hire, we had cabinet ministers giving passports for favours, we had a prime minister questioned by the police under cash for honours.

‘They are in no position to lecture anyone on standards in public life.’

Under Whitehall rules it is for the Prime Minister himself - in consultation with his senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood - to decide whether any alleged breaches require investigation by his independent adviser on ministers' interest.

It is also for the PM himself to decide what action should be taken over any breach of the code.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last night insisted there was a ‘clear dividing line’ preventing Mr Crosby lobbying on public health issues.

He told BBC 2's Newsnight: ‘He hasn't lobbied me and he hasn't lobbied the Prime Minister on issues to do with public health and there's a clear dividing line. But there's also transparency, we're not hiding this fact.’

Asked if public health was a whole area Mr Crosby was not allowed to touch, he replied: ‘Yes’.

Shelved: England will not follow Australia in introducing plain cigarette packaging

Delay: Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette 
packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking,
but the UK government will not follow suit

A Downing Street source refused to answer questions about whether Mr Cameron had conversations with Mr Crosby over cigarette packaging.

The source said only: ‘Lynton Crosby's firm advises the Conservative Party on strategy, not ministers on Government policy.’

And Mr Crosby himself declined to answer the same question, telling the BBC: ‘The Prime Minister's said everything that needs to be said on that issue.’

But Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps was more forthright in denying that there had been any conversation.

When asked on BBC Radio 4's World At One ‘Did Lynton Crosby have any conversations with ministers about the strategy on packaging for cigarettes?’, Mr Shapps replied simply: ‘No.’
