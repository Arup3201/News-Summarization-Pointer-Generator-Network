A 46-year-old mother has been jailed for more than two years after a seven-year benefit fraud that saw her wrongfully receive £75,000 of taxpayers' money.

Mother-of-three Andrea Blakeburn, of Darlington, County Durham, repeatedly told officials from the council and the Department for Work and Pensions that she lived alone with her children.

But her crime was uncovered when investigators looked around the supposed single mother’s home in January and found her partner Ronald Thomas underneath some a duvet.

'Single mother': Andrea Blakeburn, 46, of Darlington, County Durham, repeatedly told officials from the council and the Department for Work and Pensions that she lived alone with her children

Her lies helped her rake in thousands of pounds a year in council tax relief and housing benefit from Darlington Borough Council, Teesside Crown Court heard.

She was also said to have received thousands of pounds in Employment Support Allowance, Income Support and Jobseeker’s Allowance.

James Fenny, defending, argued that Blakeburn had not lived an extravagant lifestyle on the money and used it simply to feed and clothe her children.

But Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told her: ‘There are many people in your position, struggling to make ends meet.

‘The message has got to come from this court that whatever the mitigation, people who carry out benefit fraud to this extent will go to prison.’

Blakeburn would struggle to cope in jail and her son, daughters and two grandchildren would also suffer, Mr Fenny told the court.

She had endured an ordeal in the community after the media revealed her fraud when she pleaded guilty last month, he said.

Locking up Blakeburn for two years and four months, Judge Bourne-Arton described the cheating as ‘persistent, deliberate and determined’.

He said: ‘People who carry out deceptions to get benefits to which they are not entitled can come from a number of different backgrounds.

'Every bit of money you got came from people who pay their taxes, many struggling to do so. It is the public who are the sufferers. It is their money'

‘Many, like you, are otherwise decent people, not well-off, struggling, but a number of those who are struggling to bring up children don’t cheat.

‘Every bit of money you got came from people who pay their taxes, many struggling to do so. It is the public who are the sufferers. It is their money.’

Mr Fenny said: ‘Clearly it is not right, and she admits her guilt. She has suffered quite a lot already. She is frightened of going to prison. There has been no lavish lifestyle here.

‘The money has been spent on children - on their shoes, clothing and food - and not holidays and cars.’

Blakeburn admitted ten charges of making false statements and two counts of failing to notify a change in circumstances between 2003 and 2010.
