Nationwide finance director Mark Rennison said efforts to cool London's booming housing market risk holding back recovery elsewhere in the country

Efforts to cool London’s booming housing market risk holding back recovery elsewhere in the country, the finance chief of Britain’s biggest building society has warned.

Bank of England governor Mark Carney recently singled out the housing market as the biggest threat to Britain’s nascent economic recovery.

Scaling back the Government’s Help to Buy scheme would be one way of taking the heat out of the London market, say some experts.

But Mark Rennison, finance director of Nationwide, said such measures carried their own risks.

‘If you take a position to cool the London market you can have unintended consequences in places like the North East,’ he said and added that, while some London postcodes are ‘running pretty hot’, the rest of Britain was ‘by no means outside the norm’.

His comments come ahead of figures released today on the Help to Buy scheme, which subsidises mortgages.

The first stage, designed to help those with little money for a deposit get on the housing ladder, applied only to first-time buyers and new-build properties.

But the second phase made the scheme available to more borrowers by providing a government guarantee on part of any home loan.

The data will show how popular this second phase has been.

Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday revealed that first-time buyers in the capital were borrowing nearly four times their salary to get on the housing ladder.

New homeowners borrowed £2.7billion in the capital in the first quarter of 2014, up 50 per cent from the same period a year ago.

Mr Rennison admitted the London market was ‘clearly unsustainable in the long term’.

The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee is expected to take steps to scale back Help to Buy by introducing stricter affordability tests for would-be borrowers.

But Mr Rennison told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I don’t believe that’s necessary at present,’ adding that it was ‘implausible’ that Help to Buy was behind rising prices.
