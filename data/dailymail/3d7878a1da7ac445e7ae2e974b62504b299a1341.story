Three years ago to the day, I crashed to the ground with severe acute pancreatitis. My own fault entirely. To mark a diagnosis of diabetes, and being in Cornwall for the holidays, I drank several beakers of single malt, plus a few bottles of burgundy, and the next thing I remember a student nurse was inserting a catheter the size of a hosepipe up what in a Victorian dictionary would be called my ‘organ of generation’.

I was in the hospital’s high dependency unit for three weeks and received a ‘get well’ card from film director Bryan Forbes and his actress wife Nanette Newman. They’d mistaken Roger Lewis for Roger Moore.

Suffice it to say, I have been teetotal since December 2011. I’ve got used to it – I have reverted to my ancestral roots and become a frowning and disapproving Welsh puritan.

ALL THAT GLITTERS: Roger Lewis meets actress Barbara Windsor during his stint in panto

One thing I no longer do, come Christmas, is go to parties. What you realise, being on the water-wagon, is how boring other people become when they are drunk or getting drunk. By staying at home I also deny journalist Lynn Barber the chance to turn her back on me – she really did that after I was rude about her in a review. A textbook snub. Silly me, I thought she’d have been used to it.

Despite the boozelessness, I adore Christmas more than ever. As with supermarkets, which start playing Sinatra and Elvis carols, it begins for me in November, my first mince pie going down the hatch round about Armistice Day. I love the nights drawing in, the cold.

Except it seldom is cold. More of a muggy drizzle. I live in Rochester, Kent, which is pretty much unchanged since Dickens’s day – an attractively seedy town with spooky cobbled alleys and yellow fogs coming off the Medway. We have poulterers and muffin men. As there’s never real snow, however, machines spray the crowds with flecks of foam. The townsfolk can’t wait to get into their Mr Pickwick costumes and walk up and down selling chestnuts and mulled wine. Tickets for the cathedral’s carol services have been sold out for months.

I’ve never had any luck finding a white Christmas, sad to report. I went to Vermont and it rained. I went to the Canadian Rockies and there was a heatwave. I watched White Christmas yet again last week – and there’s no snow in that either, until the very end, when it is plainly a Hollywood studio set.

What this indicates is what a massive fabrication the whole glittery season is – a big cynical excuse for a commercial orgy, an eating orgy, but probably not an orgy orgy as everyone is too stupefied to want to be bothered with any of that and too pie-eyed to know whom to address scented thank-you notelets to afterwards.

Nonetheless, I am a sucker for the theatricality (ie the kitsch) of Christmas. Not only are my halls decked with boughs of holly, my tree is a death-trap. I’ve never mastered the art of getting it to remain vertical so it tilts alarmingly, the coloured lights popping and fizzing on their frayed cord. I send out more than a hundred cards. I get about 20 back, mostly from school pals I have not clapped eyes on for 40 years who insist on enclosing their boastful round-robins: ‘I was invited by HM The Queen,’ said one, ‘to the Order of the Garter Service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.’ My social highlight in 2014 was seeing Jeremy Paxman in the gents at the Garrick Club.

In Little Women, one of the monstrous moppets says that Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without any presents. For me, Christmas wouldn’t be Christmas without the telly.

For weeks now I have been munching Lindt chocolate reindeers as I watch absolutely terrible seasonal films on Channel 5. There are heaps of them – all the same: Santa and Mrs Santa incognito in an old folk’s home; single mums finding romance over the eggnog; hedge-fund bankers mending their Scrooge-like ways; divorcees in novelty knitwear getting reconciled.

On some cable channel or other, Jamie has been stuffing his birds for ages, Nigella is licking her beaters endlessly, and over at River Cottage ‘sprouts are given a new lease of life by Hugh’.

Since going teetotal Roger Lewis enjoys Christmas 'more than ever'

It is not that programmes are recycled – they are in a loop. Barbara and Jim Royle, the original goggleboxers, are always swearing and being coarse; Gavin and Stacey, the Welsh-Essex Romeo and Juliet, are forever eating Christmas dinner, as is Dawn French’s vicar of Dibley. Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, Jonathan Creek, Morse and Frost have a never-ending series of cases to crack. Happy Christmas to all the actors who are raking in the repeat fees!

It’s easy enough to sneer at Christmas and be curmudgeonly, but I wasn’t impressed when a friend in Edinburgh, a genuine Scrooge who keeps unused boiled water in a flask next to the kettle, told me he and his wife liked nothing more than to go for a walk on Christmas Day, staring in through people’s windows at families falling out.

For there are good things to be had at Christmas – love, warmth, nostalgia – not just the chance to be superior by observing greed or mocking sentimental claptrap.

For example, this year there will be a round-up of my children, who, when they weren’t being told by the doctors in Cornwall that ‘there’s a chance that your father may still be with us at Christmas’, have been abroad in more recent years, breaking down in a VW camper van in France, for example, or earning a crust in a travelling circus.

My son the clown, by the way, has been doing a stint in a red suit as Santa this past month in a garden centre near Bagshot, Surrey. He gets seven minutes off each hour when the elf does a magic show.

Actually, one of the reasons my sons will be descending is that they have been dumped by their girlfriends, so Mum and Dad will foot the bill for the sad loners’ wassailing. Now I don’t drink, what I do to create that special atmosphere of well-being is eat, so I am happy to be in charge of the feasts. No microwaved rubbish either. The smell of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and candied peel will waft about like nobody’s business.

On the menu will be carp or pike simmered in beer and gingerbread, small parcels of pasta containing chopped pork marinated in marsala, venison served with juniper berries and poached pears, plus the traditional free-range turkey and the Christmas pudding from Fortnum’s.

If I run out of brandy butter, I’ve always wanted to try to replicate Rik Mayall’s invention of vodka margarine – though saying this, it suddenly occurs to me that the alcohol in all these recipes may very well kill me. What a way to go.
