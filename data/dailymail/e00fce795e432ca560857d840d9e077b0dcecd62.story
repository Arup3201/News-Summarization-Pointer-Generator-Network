The winners of this year's Oscars have moved us to tears, laughter, fear and agony.

But how can actors produce experiences that not only engage our imaginations, but that feel real?

Neuroscientist, Jeffrey Zacks, believes it's all down to two simple rules which he has dubbed the 'mirror rule' and the 'success rule.'

How can actors produce experiences that not only engage our imaginations, but that feel real? Neuroscientist, Jeffrey Zacks, believes it's all down to two simple rules which he has dubbed the 'mirror rule' and the 'success rule.'

The mirror rule describes the powerful - yet often subconscious - compulsion to do the same thing that those around us are doing.

It explains why our body language tends to mirror those around us, why we're prone to laugh or cry, to smile or grimace as we watch someone else do the same, regardless of whether these actions are occurring in real life or on a movie screen.

The success rule tells us to 'do what has worked' in the past. In real life, we've learned to duck when flying objects approach us, to prepare to fight or flee when faced with danger, and we bring these same habits with us when we experience a film.

It's the success rule, Professor Zacks said, that explains why film goers might find themselves ducking a bit in their seats when the Jabberwock's head falls in Tim Burton's film version of 'Alice in Wonderland.'

'One of the striking things about understanding movies is that you come into the theatre with the brain that you evolved over three-and-a-half billion years to understand the real world' he said.

'For the most part, your brain just treats what it's seeing on the screen as if it were real,' added the Washington University professor. 

In his book 'Flicker,' Professor Zacks explores how film-making commandeers these and other human traits to make the viewing experience so emotional.

If you cry at sad scenes in films, tweet and post emotional links and jump to help the less fortunate, you could be genetically predisposed to 'sensory processing sensitivity', researchers say.

California researchers have found that up to 20 per cent of people are affected, having a highly sensitive brain that responds to emotional images.

The researchers used fMRI scans to monitor the level of empathy - and say the emotion levels are particularly high if pictures of partners smiling are shown.

Stony Brook University psychologists Arthur and Elaine Aron say roughly 20 per cent of the population is affected by sensory processing sensitivity (SPS), an innate trait associated with greater sensitivity, or responsiveness, to environmental and social stimuli.

In a study last year, the University of California found that Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) of brains provide physical evidence that the 'highly sensitive' brain responds powerfully to emotional images.

According to Dr Arthur Aron, lead author, the trait is becoming increasingly associated with identifiable behaviors, genes, physiological reactions, and patterns of brain activation. 

Highly sensitive people tend to show heightened awareness to subtle stimuli, process information more thoroughly, and be more reactive to both positive and negative stimuli, the researchers say.

'We're learning more and more about what makes a film gripping, what makes it engaging,' Professor Zacks said.

Yet Professor Zacks does not see science replacing aesthetics. '(Science) can't tell us if it's good or bad,' he said.

'It might be able to tell us something about what's going to be popular or not.

'The most important thing that we can do as psychologists and neurophysiologists for filmmakers is to tell them, 'If you make this choice, here's what's going to happen.'

'Then as a filmmaker, you still have to decide, 'Is this what I want to happen, is that aesthetically pleasing, is that satisfying or not?'

Mirror rule describes the powerful compulsion to do the same thing that those around us are doing, whether it is in real life or just a film

Success rule, meanwhile, tells us to 'do what has worked' in the past
