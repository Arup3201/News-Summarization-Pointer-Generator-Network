There's no denying Donald Trump is a big wig - but researchers have photographed a caterpillar that bears an uncanny resemblance to the property mogul's hair.

With its brightly coloured, carefully parted 'do' the bizarre looking caterpillar has been compared to the U.S property mogul's unique look.

The creature was spotted in the Amazon by friends Jeff Cremer, 34 and Phil Torres, 27, who run photography tours from Posada Amazonas, a 30 bed rainforest lodge in Peru.

Nicknamed the 'Donald Trump Caterpillar', this creature is actually a flannel moth. They are found in Mexico, southern parts of the US, and some parts of central America. This one was found in the Amazon rainforest

Who wore it best? Donald Trump's iconic hairstyle bears an uncanny resemblance to the flannel moth

The official name of the flannel moth is Megalopyge opercularis.

It's also known as a pussy moth, or puss caterpillar, because its hair-like setae resembles a tiny Persian cat.

Like Donald Trump, it often has a streak of bright orange running through it.

When the moth is in the early-stages of larvae the 'hair' is curly and cottony.

The moth's hair is actually venomous spines and can cause skin irritations.

Conservation biologist Phil and wildlife photographer Jeff were leading a small group of tourists on a recent tour when Phil spotted the insect on a leaf and was so struck by its fluffy mane he couldn't resist taking a photo.

Jeff said 'On these tours we take tourists and photographers into the Amazon and point out cool and unusual things for them to photograph.

'We have been leading photo tours together for two years and have never seen anything as strange as this.'

Phil, a seasoned field biologist, said 'I've seen some bizarre looking caterpillars in my time of working in the field but this was definitely the weirdest one I've ever seen.

'I wasn't sure what I was looking at at first, it was this big yellow fuzzy thing. 

This is the equivalent of the 'Donald Trump moth's' cocoon, however, the larva does not spin a cocoon in the conventional sense, instead the moth separates from its furry skin and uses it as a protective covering while it pupates

After the southern flannel moth has finished pupating and left its cocoon, it looks more like a bee than Donald Trump

Donald John Trump, Sr. is an American business magnate, TV personality and author.

He was born June 14, 1946 and is the chairman and president of The Trump Organization.

He has starred in the US version of Apprentice and came 14th on the 2012 Forbes Celebrity 100 list.

Trump is nicknamed 'The Donald' after his first wife Ivana referred to him as such in a interview in 2008.

In 2007 Trump appeared at WrestleMania 23 in Michigan with Bobby Lashley, who competed against Umaga and WWE Chairman McMahon.

Whoever lost would had to shave their head. Luckily for the flannel moth Umaga lost and McMahon's head was shaved. 

'It's actually a flannel moth caterpillar, they're really rare, I've seen this type of caterpillar before but never one of this colour.

'We put the picture of our Twitter and Facebook page and immediately people started comparing it to Donald Trump.

'We didn't see the resemblance when we first saw the caterpillar but looking at the photo it's certainly similar to his hair.

'It was pretty funny, people went mad for the photo comparing it to his toupee.

'I think if Donald saw it himself, he'd find a reason to come down and check the caterpillar out.

'It's not the most approachable of caterpillars either- if you touch that thing it would seriously hurt, it has these little hairs that can poke into your skin and release a venom.

'When we show people the image some don't even know what it is, some think it's a mammal others a bird or some have said a plant.

'But to us and most of the people who've seen it, it's Donald Trump's toupee - left on a leaf in the Amazon."
