Disgraced former Governor Eliot Spitzer choked back tears Tuesday morning as he opened up about his decision to re-enter the public sphere.

Spitzer, who resigned from office five years ago after it was revealed that he solicited prostitutes, is now running for the New York City comptroller's office, and he has spent much of the past 24 hours since he announced his candidacy apologizing to voters.

During an appearance on today's Morning Joe, Spitzer said he has reflected and grown since his fall from grace.

'You go through that pain, you change,' Spitzer said, getting visibly choked up.

Emotional moment: Eliot Spitzer's voice rattled slightly when he talked about the pain he and his family have gone through over the past five years after he resigned as Governor of New York

Spitzer announced that he would be running for the position-effectively the city's financial manager- late Sunday and made his first public appearance on Monday where he was swarmed by a mob of journalists.

He gave several interviews on Monday, but his first truly emotional moment came at the end of his Morning Joe appearance.

'I failed, I had flaws, made horrific judgements, was unfaithful to my family, to the electorate- that's why I resigned. I stood up and I said I'm holding myself accountable,' he said during the segment. 

'In those five years, I've reflected, I have thought, I've taught, I've written, I've done a multitude of things- run our family business- and I now think after five years- a lengthy period of time- and I can go to the public and say "Look at the totality of who I am."'

Back in the public eye: Before he resigned, Spitzer was known as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' because of his tough stance against banks and the role of City comptroller would have him dealing with them extensively

Though he opened the interview saying he was 'mystified' by the press attention that his involvement with prostitutes, much of the interview was dedicated to questions of whether New Yorkers could trust him again after he admitted to breaking a number of laws.

'I am ready to take the incoming missiles, some of them are hitting- I understand that. I've spent five years thinking, apologizing. I'm ready to ask for forgiveness. It's not easy, I'm ready to ask,' he said.

Women of his past: Ashley Dupre (left) is the prostitute who met with Spitzer, and Kristin Davis (right) was allegedly the madam who arranged the trysts and she now says she will run against him for comptroller

Support: His wife Silda stood by his side when he announced that he would resign in 2008 following the scandal

Out and about: Silda was not spotted alongside her husband on Monday but she has attended a number of New York charity and society functions lately

He said that one of the toughest parts of
the resignation was looking his 'family in the eye' and though he did 
not address them specifically this morning, he previously said that he 
discussed the run with his wife Silda and their three daughters before 
launching his bid.

Some critics said that the show of emotion seemed contrived- and noted that there were no actual tears- but co-host Mika Brzezinski sided with the former governor.

'He was raw and all there. It was pretty powerful. Don’t know if it’ll change things for him, but I do appreciate a person who’s made mistakes coming and facing the cameras and facing the questions. That’s actually a test of character,' she told Politico.

His choice to appear on Morning Joe, the daily political and economic news show aired on MSNBC, as opposed to a local news program may not help him in his immediate agenda.

In order to actually qualify for the position, Spitzer must collect 4,000 signatures by Thursday in order to qualify for the race.

His direct competition is Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer, a Democrat who was initially expected to run for Mayor but opted for the more financially-focused role. 

Taking the insults: The former governor was met with some shouts from hecklers when he went to Union Square on Monday in his first public appearance since announcing his bid

While he has the attention of the media, his first real goal is to connect with voters as he has to gather at least 4,000 signatures by Thursday from residents who support his campaign in order to run
