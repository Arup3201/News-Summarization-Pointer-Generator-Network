Celebrities have been watching millions of their Instagram followers vanish after the social media site announced that it was going to crack down hard on spammers and fake accounts.

Justin Bieber, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Ariana Grande and Harry Styles were among those hardest hit by the process - dubbed 'Instagram Rapture' - that kicked off this week.

The photo-sharing site said it was removing deactivated spam accounts and accounts that violate their community guidelines.

The Instagram crackdown has caused a major shake-up in the Instagram stakes, with Kim Kardashian (right) taking the crown from Justin Bieber (left) as the most followed person on the site, with 22.2 million followers

Bieber lost a massive 3.5 million fans in 24 hours (15 per cent of his total), while Kim Kardashian watched 1.3 million disappear and Harry Styles saw his followers tumble by more than 800,000.

This has caused a major shake-up in the Instagram stakes, with Kim Kardashian taking the crown from Bieber as the most followed person on the site, with 22.2 million followers.

Bieber is now in third place behind Beyonce Knowles, who lost around 866,000 followers after the purge, but is still sitting pretty with a total of 21.4 million followers.

According to an infographic produced by web developer Zach Allia, other casualties in the spam crackdown included Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Niall Horan and Bruno Mars, who all lost more than 700,000 followers each.

Rapper Ma$e is reported to have gone so far as to delete his Instagram account, after losing 1.5 million followers out of 1.6 million, taking his new follower total to just 272,000.

'We want to maintain the best possible experience on Instagram, so we do our best to remove spam, fake accounts and other people and posts that don't follow our Community Guidelines,' the company wrote in a blog post last Wednesday.

Instagram uses took to Twitter to express their shock - and even outrage - over the clampdown this week

'As we remove these accounts, some people may notice a decrease in their follower/following counts.'

'When we remove accounts from Instagram that don't follow our Community Guidelines, you may see a decrease in your follower count.

'This shouldn't affect engagement from authentic accounts that like and comment on your posts.' 

Celebrities have long been suspected of buying followers to improve their standing on social media sites - and for some commentators this 'Instagram rapture' appeared to confirm these suspicions.

'This Instagram bloodbath is hilarious,' Josh 'The Fat Jew' Ostrovsky, a popular Instagrammer with 2.2 million followers, told Business Insider.

'This should be a national Holiday. We all know who bought followers, so today just corroborated everyone's suspicions. So many people losing their followers, watching their digital worlds crumble. Today is so fun.' 

But it wasn't only celebrities who lost followers, as users across the site saw their follower numbers drop, causing many to lash out at Instagram's new policy.

'Why the hell would u do this?!?!? I lost like 30 followers! We earned them!!! We don't care if they're spams or fake!! We just like the fact that they follow us!!! Please give them back!!!!!' one user wrote.

But other users welcomed the Instagram crackdown and have called for other social media sites to follow suit and clean-up their acts.

Talk show host Andy Cohen tweeted: 'I lost 20k followers in the #InstagramPurge and I'm feeling cleaner than ever! Only real people, please! Twitter, next?'
