Liverpool and Chelsea meet at Anfield on Tuesday night in the first leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final.

The two sides have a recent history of producing memorable moments in cup competitions, with a number of fierce battles in the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup over the last decade.

Here, we take a look at the games which have defined one of football's modern rivalries.

2005 CARLING CUP FINAL - LIVERPOOL 2-3 CHELSEA (AFTER EXTRA-TIME)

Jose Mourinho's first piece of silverware as Chelsea manager came courtesy of an extraordinary League Cup final success over Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium.

John Arne Riise put Rafa Benitez's side ahead with a volley inside the opening minute but a Steven Gerrard own-goal took the final into extra-time.

Mourinho was sent off during normal time but watched Didier Drogba and Mateja Kezman both strike to put his side in control, with the Blues able to hold on for the win despite Antonio Nunez reducing the deficit with a late header.

2005 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL 1-0 CHELSEA (ON AGGREGATE)

Later that same season the two sides met for a place in the Champions League final, with Mourinho looking to defend the trophy he had won at Porto the year before.

After a goalless first leg at Stamford Bridge, controversy reigned as Luis Garcia scored the only goal of the game on four minutes to send Liverpool into the final in Istanbul.

Garcia's 'ghost goal' caused hysteria among Chelsea's camp as the ball did not appear to cross the line before being hacked away by William Gallas - but it was the Reds who went on to win their fifth European Cup after a penalty shootout victory over AC Milan in the final.

2005-06 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE GROUP STAGE - BOTH GAMES 0-0 

After winning the Champions League but finishing fifth in the Premier League, Liverpool were invited to take part in the competition again.

However, they were not afforded country protection and were subsequently paired with Chelsea in the group stages.

This time there was nothing between them, with both games ending in goalless draws.

2006 FA CUP SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL 2-1 CHELSEA

The two teams met once again in a cup competition when they were drawn against each other in the FA Cup semi-finals.

John Arne Riise opened the scoring for the Reds at Old Trafford, before Luis Garcia netted another goal against Mourinho's men.

Didier Drogba grabbed a goal for the Blues but they couldn't prevent Benitez's side reaching the final against West Ham, a game they won via a dramatic penalty shootout.

2007 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL 1-1 CHELSEA (ON AGGREGATE, LIVERPOOL WON 4-1 ON PENALTIES)

Joe Cole's strike at Stamford Bridge gave Chelsea a 1-0 advantage heading into the game at Anfield, but once again Liverpool found a way to reach the final.

Defender Daniel Agger swept home the equaliser to force extra-time, before Pepe Reina made himself a hero by saving spot-kicks from Arjen Robben and Geremi in a shootout.

The Reds faced AC Milan once again in the final but this time they couldn't conjure up a miracle, eventually going down 2-1 in Athens.

2007-08 CARLING CUP QUARTER-FINAL - CHELSEA 2-0 LIVERPOOL

Second-half goals from Frank Lampard and the much-maligned Andriy Shevchenko were enough for Chelsea as they cruised into the semi-finals of the Carling Cup.

Liverpool striker Peter Crouch saw red for a reckless tackle on John Obi Mikel as the visitors to Stamford Bridge exited the competition.

The Blues went on to reach the final but were defeated in extra-time by London rivals Tottenham.

2008 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE SEMI-FINAL - CHELSEA 4-3 LIVERPOOL (ON AGGREGATE)

Chelsea were the side celebrating when the two teams met in the semi-finals this time - with the match following a similar script to their 2005 League Cup final encounter.

Having drawn 1-1 at Anfield, Drogba drilled Chelsea ahead only for future Blues striker Fernando Torres to level and send the game into extra-time.

There, a Frank Lampard penalty and a second of the night for Drogba put Avram Grant's Chelsea on course for the final and they reached Moscow - where they would lose on penalties to Manchester United - despite Ryan Babel scoring a late consolation for Liverpool.

2009 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE QUARTER-FINAL - CHELSEA 7-5 LIVERPOOL (ON AGGREGATE)

The teams met yet again, this in the last eight of the 2008-09 competition, with Chelsea holding a 3-1 advantage after an impressive win at Anfield.

But Liverpool threatened to stage a remarkable comeback as a Fabio Auerilo free-kick and Xabi Alonso's penalty put Benitez's side back in the tie with a 2-0 half-time lead.

The fightback was ended before the hour however, as Drogba and Alex struck for the hosts - with Lampard adding a third before Lucas and Dirk Kuyt put Liverpool back in front on the night.

Lampard levelled late on to end the scoring and take Guus Hiddink's side into a semi-final with Barcelona that ended with the Spaniards qualifying for the final.

2011-12 CARLING CUP QUARTER FINAL - CHELSEA 0-2 LIVERPOOL 

Blues boss Andre Villas-Boas was put under more pressure after this home defeat, which was secured by two goals in the space of just five minutes.

Maxi Rodriguez and Martin Kelly struck for the visitors in the second half as an under-strength Chelsea side were dumped out at the last-eight stage.

The Reds continued their cup form by making it all the way to the final, eventually beating Championship outfit Cardiff on penalties to lift the trophy.

2012 FA CUP FINAL - CHELSEA 2 - 1 LIVERPOOL

Chelsea, under interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, got the better of Kenny Dalglish's Liverpool as Drogba once again proved the thorn in their side.

The Ivory Coast striker netted his fourth FA Cup final goal to double Chelsea's advantage after Ramires had put them in front at half-time.

Liverpool rallied and the introduction of Andy Carroll from the bench caused problems for the Blues defence, with the former Newcastle man pulling a goal back before seeing a header tipped on to the bar by Petr Cech.

Di Matteo's side hung on and went on to complete a double by sealing their first European Cup success two weeks later with a penalty shootout victory over Bayern Munich.
