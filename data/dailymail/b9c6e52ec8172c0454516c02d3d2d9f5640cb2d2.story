A British jihadi fighting for the Islamic State in Syria has been showing off his rapping skills on Twitter - urging his followers to stop playing video games and devote their lives to terrorism instead.

Peppering his bizarre schoolboy rhymes with UK street slang and references to popular Western culture, Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro's page is filled with references to life in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, where he says 'death is near' but he claims to 'show no fear'.

Declaring himself to be a 'poet', al-Britani Afro also hints at a past life as a drug dealer in the UK, saying: 'Not many seen wat I have seen... Used to be on the street like a vending machine [sic]'.

It is thought that al-Britani Afro - who has also used the nom de guerre Abu Qaqa al-Afreeki in an apparent nod to his African descent - is in his early 20s and first arrived in Syria earlier this year.

Militant: Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro, whose real identity is not known, regularly posts 'selfies' on Twitter showing him wearing a floppy floppy fisherman hat, a balaclava and glasses in the majority of his pictures

Rapper: Each of the militant's simplistic rhymes draws a string of positive comments from the 500 people following him on Twitter - suggesting his bizarre rhymes are held in high regard by ISIS supporters

Al-Britani Afro, whose real identity is not known, regularly posts 'selfies' on Twitter showing him wearing a floppy fisherman hat, a balaclava and glasses in the majority of his pictures.

Posing with AK47 assault rifles resting between his arms, the rapping jihadi also dresses in light Western-style rain jackets, rather than the heavy combat gear his fellow militants typically wear.

However it is in his bizarre rhymes celebrating ISIS' brutal interpretation of extremist Islam that Al-Britani Afro truly betrays his Western upbringing.

'Call of Duty Drop the Fifa and come give bayeh to the Khalifah,' he writes in one message urging his followers to stop playing popular video games and declare to their allegiance to the leader of the terror group Abu Bakr as-Baghdadi.

Another message trumpeted the recent sickening filmed beheading of 16 Syrian soldiers by a band of ISIS killers including the groups British chief executioner 'Jihadi John'.

'That video was epic / Head chopped of no need for the medic / Fake Scholar all apologetic / So pathetic / Remember to kuffar [non-Muslims] we ain't sympathetic,' he wrote

Each of the militant's simplistic rhymes draws a string of positive comments from the 500 people following him on Twitter - suggesting his bizarre rhymes are held in high regard by ISIS supporters.

Armed: Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro first emerged on Twitter in mid-October 2014, using the now suspended twitter handle, @BritaniQaqa. He is understood to have arrived in Syria a short time before

Following the suspension of his first Twitter account, al-Britani Afro  created a second profile @AbuQaqaBrit

Self-declared poet: Abu Qaqa al-Britani Afro's page is filled with references to life in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, where he says 'death is near' but he claims to 'show no fear'

Al-Britani Afro first emerged on Twitter in mid-October 2014, using the now suspended twitter handle, @BritaniQaqa. 

One of his fellow British ISIS fighters, Abu 3antarr al-Britani, was among the first to raise awareness of Abu Qaqa's account.

'Everybody follow my brother @BritaniQaqa, he is new on Twitter. He is in dawla [ISIS-held areas of Syria and Iraq]. He is radicalised and he is armed.'

Following the suspension of his first Twitter account, Abu Qaqa hastily created a second profile.

Again, Abu 3antar, was quick to promote the extremists' latest Twitter page, writing that 'his rhymes are affecting the kuffar [non-Muslims], so support him.'

The close online relationship between the pair suggests they may well be stationed together in the group's de facto capital city Raqqa.

Al-Britani Afro, who also uses the name 'Greenbird Express', has recently been tweeting about the airstrikes being carried out on Raqqa by the Assad regime.

He urges his followers to pray 'nothing happens to our women and children' in Raqqa but insists his own safety is of little concern. 

'This is the life I choose / None can oppose / Trapped in the Dunya [on Earth] trying to perfect my flows / The cursed one, I don't want to be one of those,' he recently wrote.

Al-Britani Afro also repeatedly expresses a desire to die fighting for ISIS, continually expressing his warped belief that killing in the name of Islam will somehow lead him to heaven.

'Upgrade your stature / Hijra is the starter/ Die as a martyr/ Green bird that's another chapter,' he writes, going on to say that he hopes to be reincarnated as a green bird in the afterlife.

Rapping jihadis: Al-Britani Afro is not the only ISIS militant to express extremist views. Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary (left) - the Londoner once suspected of being Jihadi John - was an aspiring rapper who appeared on Radio One before joining ISIS. German jihadi Denis Cusper (right) - was also once a successful rapper

Jihadi poetry has a long history in the Islamic world. 

Details on the lives of militants known as the Mujahideen during the 1979 Afghan war, were often recorded through poems

Many of these rhymes feature elaborate musings on what the fighters expects to be met with in the afterlife.

They were typically written during the quieter moments of the conflict with the Soviet Union. 

Osama bin Laden was well known for his poetry on jihad.

His verses described the thrill of battles and the companionship of his fellow fighters. 

Al-Britani Afro is not the only ISIS militant to use rap as a means to express extremist views.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary - the Londoner who was once suspected of being Jihadi John until security officials ruled him out - was an aspiring rapper who appeared on Radio One before swapping the microphone for an AK47.

Formerly known by his stage name, L Jinny one of Bary's friends was previously quited as saying: 'He had the talent - he could have been as big as Dizzee Rascal.'

Likewise German fighter Denis Cusper - who was recently shown beheading an Iraqi tribesmen in another sickening ISIS murder film - was also once a successful hip hop artist.

Performing under the name Deso Dogg, Cusper gave up his music after embracing radical Isla, adopting the nom de guerre Abu Talha al-Almani and travelling to join ISIS in Syria.
