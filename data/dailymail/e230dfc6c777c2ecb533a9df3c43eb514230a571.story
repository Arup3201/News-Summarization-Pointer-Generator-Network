A former escort and transsexual is hoping to find the man of her dreams this Valentine's Day having already bedded over 100 men in just two years on her search. 

Tiffany Davies, 23, was born male and says that despite her luck in the bedroom, she is struggling to bag a Valentine's date.

Tiffany, from Birmingham, grew up as a boy called Niall. She says that she knew from the age of 12 that she was a transsexual after using the internet to search her symptoms.

Although Tiffany is yet to undergo a full sex change operation she has made progress on her journey thus far and says that she now receives plenty of male attention. 

Tiffany is an aspiring glamour model and feels that it is this self-confidence and appearance that has bagged her so many men in the past two years.

However, despite proving popular with men Tiffany says that she will be spending February 14 alone. 

'I'm desperate for a Valentine's date this year. I'll have a microwave ready meal for one but I want to be wined and dined like other women.'

Tiffany added that she thinks she has a lot to offer a man as she puts a lot of effort into her appearance, she says unlike a lot of other women. 

'I'm probably a lot more glamorous than most real women, I love doing my make-up, wearing fake eye lashes and curling my long brown hair.

Tiffany has bedded over 100 men in the past two years but is on the hunt for a husband 

Tiffany says she receives plenty of attention from men in bars and she says she thinks that this down to the fact that she makes a lot of effort with her appearance and is more glamorous than most women 

Tiffany says that despite her success in the bedroom she will be spending Valentine's day alone this year

'Jealous girls will sometimes laugh and stare at me in the street but I don't care, I know I look great and that's all that matters. 

'I find men always shower me in compliments on nights out, they love my womanly frame and big bum.'

Tiffany hopes that her by having a full sex change it will be easier for her to find a man 

Tiffany is hoping to undergo a breast enlargement later this year, something she feels will help her bag a boyfriend.

'I can't wait to have big boobs, I feel that it will help me attract even more attention from men on nights out.'

Tiffany says that her looks have become so convincing that a lot of the time men will approach her not realising she is transitioning.  

'I love it when men don't realise I'm a transsexual, I do always tell them when they're chatting me up but often they won't even care that I still have all my male parts.'

Tiffany has previously used her good looks to her advantage working as a professional escort which saw her take on many partners.  

'I did escorting for a while and I have bedded around 100 men but I rarely do that any more.'

Tiffany, who is currently unemployed, has high hopes of getting married one day and once her full gender transition is complete, she feels her luck in love will change.

'I want a husband who spoils me when I'm transitioned.

'I have no problem getting men into my bedroom but I find it hard holding down a relationship.

'The operation will be funded by the NHS but I have chosen to pay for my boob job myself when I save up enough money.' 

Her hormones have aided her transformation to become a woman, and as she watched her body change, she was over the moon to see her womanly shape appear.

'My frame is naturally small but instead of feeling like a nerdy boy with no shape, my bum has grown huge.

'I love my bum, especially when I'm out with friends, I always try and wear dresses that emphasise it.

'Men always compliment my figure, I'm so thankful to the hormone treatment as they make me feel so feminine.'

Tiffany uses web cams to talk to men intimately online and says that she finds this a more convenient way to find possible dates.

'I often chat to men online as it's an easy way to meet new people and start new relationships.

'I'm hoping to meet the man of my dreams one day but I don't think I'll be going on a Valentine's Day date this year.'
