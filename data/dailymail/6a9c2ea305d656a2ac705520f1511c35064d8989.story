Thomas Hindhaugh, who admitted theft after stealing over £10,000 from Karen Ann Bolton, whom he met online

A divorcee was left devastated when a new partner she met online stole £10,000 of her savings and broke her heart.

Recently divorced single mum Karen Ann Bolton met Thomas Hindhaugh of Dunston, Gateshead on dating website Plenty of Fish.

Ms Bolton, 40 believed they were in a serious relationship after smooth-talking Hindhaugh,who has 86 previous convictions, many for dishonesty, expressed his undying love for here.

But one night after she went to bed, Hindhaugh helped himself to £10,800 of Ms Bolton's money that she had recently received from the sale of her marital home.

The 27-year-old then used the money to book into Newcastle's Vermont Hotel before blowing the rest of the cash on drink and drugs.

Today, Hindhaugh was jailed for 20 months at Newcastle Crown Court after pleading guilty to theft.

Ms Bolton, had withdrawn the money to pay to renovate her new home in Blyth, Northumberland and says she has now been left in terror and suffering nightmares as a result of the betrayal.

In a statement read to the court she said: 'The relationship I had with him was serious, I loved him.

'I was absolutely devastated when he stole my money after expressing his undying love for me.

I thought it was a fantastic relationship but after he stole my money I was left heartbroken because I never thought he would do this to me.

'This was meant to be a new beginning after the breakdown of my marriage, it was meant to be the start of a new life.

'He destroyed all my plans for a new beginning as well as breaking my heart, he preyed on me and used me for the money.'

Ms Bolton met Hindhaugh online last July and they began dating, becoming a couple.

By January this year she received some money from the sale of her former marital home after her divorce went through.

And it was after she withdrew it to pay some builders that Hindhaugh decided to steal it and leave his lover.

After booking into the Vermont Hotel he went on a drink and drugs binge before being arrested two days later.

However, police didn’t find any of the cash and Hindhaugh continued his binge after being bailed.

Ms Bolton said the offence has left her feeling afraid in her new home, which she was unable to have renovated due to the loss of the money.

She added: “I can’t describe the terror I’m feeling since that night, I’ve been really nervous, I cant sleep and I’ve had nightmares about him finding and hurting me.

'I’ve never felt this frightened before, my world has turned upside down.

'I realised he was obsessive but I thought that meant he loved me. I now realise he lied about everything.'

Richard Bloomfield, defending, said: “These sorts of offences are often described with language that begins with mean and ends with despicable.

'He spent the money on drink and drugs, he has been addicted to drugs for many years.'

But jailing him, Judge Penny Moreland said: “The effect on her and her family and their plans for the future has been devastating.

'You have an appalling record for offences of dishonesty and this was a great deal of money. Your callousness in going on to spend that money after your arrest aggravates your position.'
