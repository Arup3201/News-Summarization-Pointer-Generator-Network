Theresa May’s Cabinet role could be under threat from Boris Johnson if voters get their way when the London Mayor makes his anticipated Commons return next year.

Asked which Cabinet job David Cameron should give Mr Johnson, Mrs May’s Home Secretary role is the top choice in one of two polls that will boost the growing ‘Boris mania’ in the Conservative Party.

A second survey suggests he will double the Conservative majority if he stands in Uxbridge, Middlesex, where the party is seeking a candidate for next year’s General Election.

Is this the face of a future Home Secretary? An opinion poll suggests that voters want Boris Johnson in the Home Office instead of Theresa May, the present incumbent

Asked which Cabinet role Mr Johnson should be given if he returns as an MP, the first choice is Home Secretary, according to a ComRes poll commissioned by public affairs firm PLMR. However, Mr Johnson’s Tory critics, who claim he lacks attention to detail, may draw comfort from the Cabinet seats voters do not want him to occupy.

Chancellor of the Exchequer, occupied by George Osborne, who is seen as a future Tory leadership rival to Mr Johnson, comes sixth on the list of preferred Cabinet posts for him. Defence Secretary, which includes responsibility for nuclear weapons, is in last place.

A separate poll by Tory peer Lord Aschroft puts Mr Johnson on course for a massive victory if he is picked for Uxbridge, where the current MP Sir John Randall is standing down.

Sir John won an 11,216 majority at the last Election, but more than half of people in Uxbridge would vote for Mr Johnson if he stands there in 2015, claims the poll.

According to the survey, when asked which party they would vote for in Uxbridge, the Tories have a 14-point majority over Labour. However, if Mr Johnson stands, the margin more than doubles to 29.

Mr Johnson has until August 28 to apply to stand in Uxbridge.
