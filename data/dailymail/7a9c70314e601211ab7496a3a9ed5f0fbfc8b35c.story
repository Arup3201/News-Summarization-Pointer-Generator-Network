The driver of the car that killed a Salford scientist in Australia in 2012 was high on drugs and driving the stolen car at more than 160mph, and has pleaded guilty to two counts on manslaughter in Western Australia's Supreme Court.

Antony Edward Fogarty, 24, was driving with a suspended licence when he sped through a red light and hit a taxi in October 2012.

British tourist Dr Sean Barrett, 36, and his taxi driver Kuldeep Singh, 28, were both killed instantly less than an hour after Barrett had arrived in Australia.

Antony Edward Fogarty (Taken from his facebook) The Supreme Court heard how Fogarty drove dangerously and recklessly across suburban Perth streets for at least half an hour before the crash, reaching speeds of up to 171 kilometres-an-hour in 60 kph zones.

The court heard that Fogarty ran a succession of red lights while driving at more than twice the speed limit, with blood tests showing that he was high on a combination of cannabis, amphetamines and methylamphetamines, as well as being intoxicated when the stolen Toyota 4x4 crashed into the taxi.

The court heard how Fogarty had climbed 
out of the wreckage of the car following the crash with a broken leg, 
only to tell witnesses that he had not been behind the wheel of the car.

A police helicopter had followed his car, but lost sight of the car when Fogarty switched off the headlights.

Police patrol cars had originally chased the stolen 
Toyota FJ Cruiser, but had dropped back, deciding the pursuit was too dangerous.

Assistant
 police Commissioner Gary Budge said the police aborted the chase 'a long, long way from where the crash occurred.'

While he didn't admit his guilt to the police, he was recorded on the phone in prison admitting to his family that he was responsible.

Dr Barrett, a doctor of quantum physics who worked at Imperial College London, had traveled to Australia to speak at a physics conference, and had planned to spend two weeks in Perth following the engagement.

But at the time of his death he had only been in the country for 20 minutes.

His mother, speaking at her home in Whalley Range in Manchester, said: 'Everybody loved him and had great respect for the work he was doing.

'He was renowned in his field even though he was only 36.

'He had an awful lot of papers published and would've gone on to do more great things.'

His family paying tribute to him at the time of his death, said: 'Sean was a brilliant mind, and a brilliant man.

'Anyone who had the pleasure to meet him in physics and beyond would tell you that.

'He was a charismatic man who had the rare gift to light up any room.

'He is a loss to science, and to life.

'He was cut short in his prime.'
