Drama teacher Vanessa Greening could be sacked after she was found guilty of smacking a pupil over the head with a folder

A drama teacher could be sacked after being convicted for smacking a 13-year-old boy in the head with a folder because he was talking in class.

Vanessa Greening, 49, lost her temper with the child as he watched other pupils perform at a high school in Tipton, in the West Midlands.

A court heard Greening flipped and 
slammed the folder she was holding into the schoolboy's head after 
hearing someone speak during the performance.

Greening from Bearwood, Birmingham, 
was sentenced to a six-month community order at Sandwell Magistrates 
Court on Friday last week after being found guilty of common assault.

The young victim, who was sat next to
 his teacher at Alexandra High School, had admitted speaking when he shouldn't, but claimed when 
Greening lashed out with the binder he hadn't said a word.

She was hauled before magistrates after parents of the pupil complained to teachers who then contacted the police.

Greening, who turned up to court clutching a folder, now faces the sack following a career in the classroom spanning 30 years.

Prosecuting, Kelly Crowe said: 
'Whilst they were watching the group do the piece of work, someone 
spoke, and the defendant who had a folder in her hand slammed it once to
 his head.'

The court heard the boy was shocked but uninjured and later told police 'it didn't hurt'.

JPs were also told Greening, who had pleaded not guilty, had been previously reprimanded for her conduct.

Defending Laura Culley said she didn't accept that the incident happened 'intentionally or otherwise.'

Following the case, headteacher Ian Binnie did not confirm whether Greening would lose her job or not.

Headteacher Ian Binnie said in a statement: 'The school reported the allegations made to the police and worked closely with them during their investigation.

'I am aware of the verdict but I am unable to comment further at the moment as the school's disciplinary procedures are underway.'
