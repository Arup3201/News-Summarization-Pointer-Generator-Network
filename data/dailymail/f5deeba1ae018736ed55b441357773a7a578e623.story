Under scrutiny: Baroness Warsi is to be investigated by the parliamentary watchdog

David Cameron has referred Baroness Warsi to his independent adviser on ministerial interests over an official trip she made to Pakistan with a business partner.

It is the first time the Prime Minister has referred a minister to Sir Alex Allan, who rules on whether politicians have broken the Ministerial Code.

The move contrasts with Mr Cameron’s refusal to ask Sir Alex to investigate Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt over his closeness to the Murdoch media empire.

Baroness Warsi yesterday issued a grovelling apology for failing to disclose her shared business interest with Abid Hussain, a relative.

The beleaguered Tory Party co-chairman apologised for any ‘embarrassment to the Government’. In response, the PM said: ‘There are clearly some lessons for future handling and I have asked Alex Allan, my adviser on ministers’ interests, to consider the issues that have been raised.’

Baroness Warsi’s position is precarious because she is unpopular with some Tory backbenchers, who want Mr Cameron to appoint an MP to the Tory chairmanship to give the position more authority.

Downing Street, however, is understood to rate the minister and is keen to keep her in the Cabinet. One rumour is that she could be given the job of International Development Secretary, in charge of Britain’s aid programme, in a reshuffle later this year.

Pressure: David Cameron is being attacked by Labout for referring Baroness Warsi to Sir Alex Allen but not Jeremy Hunt

However, if Sir Alex rules against her, it could spell the end for her ministerial career. The referral relates to an undeclared relationship with Mr Hussain, who accompanied her to Pakistan in July 2010 and assisted the British High Commission with outreach events there.

She said Mr Hussain was her husband’s second cousin and this fact was ‘widely known’. But she added that she did not realise the need to declare they had ‘a common business interest as minority shareholders in a small food company’.

Labour’s Michael Dugher, shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said: ‘Baroness Warsi clearly has very serious questions to answer.

‘But David Cameron’s actions in this case draw into sharp relief his refusal to hold a similar investigation into Jeremy Hunt, despite clear evidence that he broke the Ministerial Code by misleading the House of Commons on at least three occasions.’
