A postal service worker has been caught on CCTV throwing parcels from truck windows instead of delivering them.

The worker was seen chucking parcels - reportedly including a HD Kindle Fire worth around $400 -  on to the driveway of a home in Georgetown on Saturday.

The owners were perplexed as to why their parcels had not been delivered properly and watched their CCTV footage of the delivery to find out.

Mr Smith and his wife complained to the local post office, but he said the response was not satisfactory

'The cameras are to catch criminals, not post men,' said Tarry Smith, Georgetown homeowner told  ABC36.

'To throw packages out of your vehicle catapult-style is a little shocking,' he said.

'I mean even if they don't ring the door bell, what's the harm in walking four or five more steps?'

Mr Smith and his wife complained to the local post office, but he said the response was not satisfactory.

His wife then posted the footage on Facebook titling it: 'Ever wonder why USPS is going out of business?'

David Van Allen of USPS Corporate Communications wrote the following when contacted by ABC 36 news: 'It is very disappointing and does not represent the kind of service we strive to provide our customers.

'This matter is currently being investigated to determine the appropriate actions taken with regards to the employee and our customer.'

The Smiths do not want the driver to lose his job.
