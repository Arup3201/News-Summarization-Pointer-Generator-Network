Lee Webb has been jailed for four years after shocked staff at his son's nursery found drugs and knives in the boy's lunch box

A father accidentally sent his son to nursery with a 'drug dealer's kit' consisting of Class A drugs and knives instead of a packed lunch, a court heard.

Drug dealer's stooge Lee Webb, 23, confused the two bags before dropping off his three-year-old child at the Smarty Pants Nursery in Folkestone, Kent.

Shocked staff opened up the toddler's rucksack at snack time expecting to find food and drink, but instead, discovered cocaine and banned stimulant mephedrone inside.

Childcare workers also found two knives, a set of scales and other drug paraphernalia, Canterbury Crown Court heard.

Webb, a tree surgeon from Folkestone, has now been jailed for four years after being convicted of possessing Class A and Class B drugs.

Judge James O'Mahony told him: 'You sent your three-year-old son to nursery with a rucksack containing a significant quantity of Class A and B drugs. In effect, you sent your son there with a drug dealer's kit.

'Your stupidity put children at risk and I consider the potential exposure to children of these drugs is so serious only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified.'

Mary Jacobson, prosecuting, said staff at the nursery alerted police but, shortly afterwards, Webb turned up and demanded the bag back.

She said that they refused to hand over the Tupperware box and Webb then left.

Ms Jacobson said the incident happened in March last year when the father of two dropped his son off at the nursery with the rucksack at 8.45am.

She said: 'The staff noted the bag contained what they thought could be drugs and they called the police.

'A PCSO arrived and took possession of the Tupperware tub with white powder, a blue wrap, a spoon, weighing scales and two knives.'

Officers later raided Webb's home and arrested him, noticing that he had written on his hand details of a local solicitor.

Webb, who also had a stash of £680 at his house, claimed he had been given the bag by another person to look after overnight.

The judge told him: 'You maintain you were holding the drugs on behalf of another and that you were expecting to be paid cash for holding the drugs.

'You must have been well-trusted by those further up the chain, although you indicated you felt intimidated by the individual you assisted.

'Yet you have rejected an opportunity to give evidence in relation to this man and, in reality, profits from selling drugs mean that those involved are invariably intimidating.'

The judge added that he accepted that giving the drugs for his son to take to nursery had been a mistake - and Webb was now genuinely remorseful.
