Diplomats in London have racked up a staggering £70 million in unpaid congestion charge fines, it emerged today.

Over the past ten years foreign embassies have accumulated more than 600,000 penalty charge notices after refusing to pay the controversial charge.

Transport for London today said 
embassies now owed £70,068,175 - and named and shamed the biggest 
culprits - with the U.S topping the list.

Over the past ten years, our Atlantic ally has picked up 66,372 penalty charge notices totalling £7.5 million - an increase of £1.2 in the last year alone.

Japan is the second most prolific offender, owing Transport for London £5.08 million while the Russians have £4.95 million in unpaid fines.

Making up the top five are the Nigerian high commission on £4 million and the German embassy, which owes £3.8 million.

The congestion charge, which brings in around £110 million a year, currently costs £10 and is active in certain areas of London from 7am to 6pm on weekdays.

For the £70 million owed by embassies, TfL could employ 3,000 bus drivers for a year or pay for 368 double-decker buses.

The total of unpaid embassy charges has rocketed by £15 million in the last year alone - a rate of £57,000 per working day.

And the cost of not paying the congestion charge is going to rise on Monday, from £120 to £130.

Around one quarter of embassies refuse to pay the charge, calling it a tax, as diplomats are exempt from paying local taxes under the 1960 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

Despite this, TfL is not giving up and has been advised by lawyers to take the matter to the Internationals Court of Justice.

However, this will require government support and TfL is currently waiting for a response from the Foreign Office.

John Mason, TfL director responsible for the Congestion Charge, said: 'We and the UK Government are clear that the congestion charge is a charge for a service and not a tax.

'This means that diplomats are not exempt from paying it.

'Around three quarters of embassies in London do pay the charge, but there remains a stubborn minority who refuse to do so, despite our representations through diplomatic channels.

'TfL will continue to pursue all unpaid congestion charge fees and related penalty charge notices and are pushing for the matter to be taken up at the International Court of Justice.'

Since it was introduced in February 2003, the Congestion Charge has generated more than £1.2 billion in revenue.

Around £960 million of this has been spent on improvements to the bus network, £102 million has gone on roads and bridges and £70 million on road safety.

Mr Mason added: 'Recovering unpaid penalties incurred by vehicles registered outside the UK can be problematic and is a well-known issue for traffic authorities such as TfL.

'Nevertheless, we work hard with our European debt recovery agency to recover penalties in relation to non-UK registered vehicles where it is possible to do so.'
