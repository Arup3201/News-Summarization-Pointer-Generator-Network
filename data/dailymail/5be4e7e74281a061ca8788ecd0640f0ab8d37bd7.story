Sepp Blatter has clinched crucial Asian support in his attempt to hold on to power despite the crisis enveloping Fifa over the World Cup anti-corruption probe.

In a major blow to the FA and UEFA who want to see the back of Blatter and are pushing for change at the top, FIFA's veteran Swiss president has been given a massive boost in his attempt to fend off rivals and win a controversial fifth term next May.

Blatter was among the guests invited to Sunday's 60th anniversary of the Asian Football Confederation in Manila and in a letter to all 47 Asian federation presidents, AFC chief Salman bin Ebrahim Al-Khalifa urged delegates to get behind him.

'President Blatter has proven to be a strong leader and a true supporters of Asian football,' Salman's letter, seen by the Mail on Sunday, said. 'I therefore ask you to join me in supporting the FIFa president and to carry on developing our prosperous collaboration in years to come.'

UEFA boss Michel Platini has ruled himself out of contention at next year's election and Salman's pro-Blatter stand will test the mettle of anyone planning to take on the 78-year-old.Â

So far only former FIFA administrator Jerome Champagne has declared his firm intention to stand while Jordan's Prince Ali bin al- Al-Hussein and Harold Mayne-Nicholls of Chile are both considering their positions.

Meantime, Alexandra Wrage, who quit FIFA's panel of advisors at the lack of proper reform, says the organization can only move forward if Blatter hands over.

In an interview recorded with CNN, Wrage said: 'I don't think FIFA is really going to turn its reputation around and really restore public confidence while [Mr Blatter] is at the helm. He's been there a very long time and lived through a large number of scandals without anything really changing.'
