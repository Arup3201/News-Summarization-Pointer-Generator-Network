Missing the old days when everyone said ‘please’ and ‘thank you’? Wondering what happened to the glorious springs of times gone by? If so, you are far from alone.

Millions of Britons are just as rueful as you about the decline in manners and the miserable weather, according to a survey.

Nearly two in three of us think people have poorer manners or are not as polite as they used to be, while more than a third believe the worst thing about modern life is the bad weather.

It never use to be this bad: Second on the list of things which people think are worse is the weather

To add to the glumness there are not 
even any decent pubs left to drown your sorrows in, as nearly one in 
three think they have got worse.

The research was conducted by 
internet search engine Ask Jeeves, which asked 1,000 men and women aged 
from 16 to 60-plus which aspects of modern life they think have gone 
downhill the most.

Manners topped the list, followed by the weather. Pubs and schools were in equal third.

Coverage of flooding and freezing 
temperatures prompted 37 per cent to think the weather has gradually 
deteriorated over the years.

Television programmes and public transport came equal fifth.

One in five said doctors were better 
in the old days, while policemen and politicians both only narrowly 
avoided places in the top ten.

Gone are the days of personal banking, with more than a quarter of those quizzed, 28 per cent, saying banks are worse.

More
 than one in four people even said children were not as good as they 
used to be, while others said doctors (20 per cent), policemen (19 per 
cent) and politicians (17 per cent) used to be better.

Despite coming more than 50 years 
after Fings Ain’t Wot They Used T’Be was a hit for Max Bygraves, the 
survey suggests that, in one way at least, little has changed in the 
public consciousness since then.

Just as the song tells how ‘we used to
 have stars, singers who sung’, one in four said music today is not as 
good as it used to be.

Not as helpful: Gone are the days of personal banking with 28 per cent believing high street banks are worse

List of people's top moans

1. Manners/politeness - 63%

2.  Weather - 37%

3. Pubs - 29%

4. Schools 29%

5. TV - 28%

6. Public transport  - 28%

7. Banks - 27%

8. Children - 26%

9. Music - 25%

One in four believe modern-day music is not as good while 17 per cent said Hollywood films were worse.

Seventeen per cent said football was not as entertaining and bizarrely, 11 per cent said sex used to be better than it is now.

But it's not all bad.

When
 it came to things that are considered better than they use to be, 
people said restaurant meals and cars had improved considerably.

The expansion of air travel 
prompted one in 10 people to say holidays are better, while a 
similar 10 per cent said fashion had improved over the decades.

A spokesman for Ask Jeeves, which polled 1,000 people, said: 'Our research shows that a number of aspects of modern day life are believed to be worse than they once were.

'It is not clear whether people look 
at things through 'rose-tinted spectacles' or just have a romantic 
notion of things being better in the past.

'Many
 people have never had it so good when it comes to things like public 
transport, choice of TV channels and entertainment venues, so it is 
interesting that these are often branded worse now than in the past.'

Moans: People's main gripes include public transport, the police and doctors. Surprisingly football is considered not as good as it use to be when footballers like George Best (right) played
