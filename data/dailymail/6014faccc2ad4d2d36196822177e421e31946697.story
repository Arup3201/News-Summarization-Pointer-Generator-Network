Nick Hancock must be the only man on the planet who didn’t know Germany had won the World Cup until this morning.

The chartered surveyor has spent the past 43 days on the most remote outpost in the UK – Rockall – beating the previous record set by a solo man by three days.

Just 20 metres high and the size of two tennis courts, the tiny granite chunk 286 miles off Scotland’s west coast is almost uninhabitable.

Save for a satellite phone, Mr Hancock was completely cut off from civilization.

But the 39-year-old wasn’t too bothered about being left out of the football mania that’s gripped the world over these past few months.

Mr Hancock, who is married to Pamela with whom he has a two-year-old son called Freddie, said:  ‘I’m not a football fan so I feel quite fortunate that I missed out on the television being dominated by the World Cup.

‘My wife, on the other hand, is a fan and joked that she was glad I was away so she could watch all the games without me complaining.’

But rather than fleeing civilization in a bid to avoid the World Cup, Mr Hancock spent 43 lonely days on the island to raise £10,000 for Help the Heroes charity.

Speaking about his achievement, Mr Hancock said: ‘I reminded myself this morning as soon as I woke up, that today was a new record.’

But Mr Hancock has had to postpone the celebrations until he gets home to Ratho, near Edinburgh, because he has no-one to toast with on the remote island.

The only other inhabitants include a few birds that he befriended earlier in his stay.

He said: ‘It’s strange really, as it’s just another day on the rock.

‘I had a little smile to myself, but there’s been no euphoria as such.

‘I had no one to celebrate with.’

Mr Hancock told how he began talking to some homing pigeons and guillemot birds to alleviate his boredom, but the wildlife had all since disappeared by the time he broke the world record.

He said: ‘It’s been relatively quiet on the wildlife front since there was a storm. ‘There’ve been no new oddities like the racing pigeons, and I haven’t seen much of the minke whales.’

Mr Hancock landed on the rock on June 5, a week before the first World Cup match kicked off, and set up his tiny yellow ‘house pod’.

He had originally planned to stay for 60 days but was forced to curtail his quest after losing four barrels of supplies in a storm at the beginning of the month.

The pod, which was secured to the rock with bolts, was just 15 metres above the lapping waves.

Mr Hancock had thought the pod was watertight but it sprung a leak in the hinge of the top hatch during the storm.

To stop more water from coming in, Mr Hancock had to close his ventilation hatches causing the temperature in the pod to soar.

After enduring the elements for more than a month, Mr Hancock is glad to be coming home.

And having eaten nothing but army ration packs, he has a few food items in mind for his arrival home.

He said: ‘I’m looking forward to a glass of wine and a pint of good ale when I get back. I think a pizza is in order too.’

Mr Hancock will no doubt be looking forward to the prospect of walking to his local Italian when he gets home, as Rockall offers little opportunity for exploring.

Much of the land is too steep and rocky to be accessible.

When Mr Hancock did stray from his pod, he wore a harness attached to the rock with a strong lifeline so he wouldn’t be blown into the sea.

The little area that his pod rests on is just 3.3 x 1.2 m (11 x 4 ft). There are no bushes or trees — just seaweed, algae and a single black lichen.

Occupation: In 1997, three Greenpeace members set the group record of 42 days.  In 1985 the former SAS soldier Tom McClean set the 40-day solo occupancy record, which Mr Hancock has just beaten

Twenty species of bird and six species of animal have been recorded on or near the island, but human beings have never been in abundance.

The first recorded landing was in 1811 by a Royal Navy officer called Basil Hall, who gave the name Hall’s Ledge to the flat area where Nick has anchored his pod.

In 1955, Rockall was claimed by a group of Royal Marines who hoisted the Union Flag there — worried that foreign forces might invade the island and use it as observation post.

Then the 1972 Island of Rockall Act was passed by Parliament, formally declaring it to be part of Inverness-shire, even though the nearest permanently inhabited settlement is 228 miles away on North Uist in the Outer Hebrides.

Over the years, Ireland, Iceland and Denmark (on behalf of the Faroe Islands) have each lodged competing claims.

In 1974 the Navy landed again, then in 1985 the former SAS soldier Tom McClean set the 40-day solo occupancy record, living in a wooden shelter. In 1997, three Greenpeace members set the group record of 42 days.
