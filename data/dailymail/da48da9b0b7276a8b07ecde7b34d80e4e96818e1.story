Stranded in a field 20 miles from the sea, he was hardly likely to make a quick escape.

Yet the emergency services were taking no chances when they launched operation Seal Rescue yesterday.

Wearing helmets and armed with brooms, firemen tried to corner the bewildered grey seal that had been spotted flopping around the field by a dog walker.

Experts have been so far unable to explain how the mammal found itself some 20miles from the coast

Local people were baffled by the seal's appearance and say it is not being 'friendly' to those trying to secure its safe return to a natural habitat

Then the police turned up to help, dressed in protective knee and elbow pads. But they could only man some fencing panels and offer advice on how to go about the tricky task. Judging by the seal’s frightened expression, maybe a few more of them should have stayed behind at the station.

In total around ten police officers, six firefighters and four wildlife rescue volunteers worked together to herd the lost seal on to a trailer in the field near Newton-le-Willows in Merseyside.

Wildlife experts are baffled at how he managed to get himself lost in the middle of a field. He is thought to belong to an established colony on Hilbre island in the Dee estuary, from where he swam to the Mersey and through a series of brooks to Newton Brook. There he may have become disoriented before making his way into the muddy field.

 ‘It is absolutely incredible that a seal has managed to get this far inland,’ one resident said. ‘He just must have kept following each water course he came across.’ 

The mammal was flailing across the muddy field when local people discovered it this morning

Fire crews have been caught to winch the creature, which is expected to be sedated by a vet later today

The animal was discovered by a dog walker in the rural setting early this morning, before police were called

Locals have described the seal as 'not very friendly' and police are warning people to stay away

Nearby residents think the seal may have swam up a local brook, which runs into the River Mersey

Local people and emergency services were left baffled by the discovery of the seal some 20miles from the River Mersey and Irish Sea

 Nicola Watkinson, who works at the nearby Red Bank Farm shop, said the seal was ‘quite large and not very friendly’.

Volunteers transported the seal to the RSPCA wildlife centre at Stapeley Grange, in Nantwich, Cheshire, where it underwent medical checks.

The RSPCA is working on a plan to escort him back to his colony. 

Police were the first called to the scene, but say their role is mainly one of 'crowd management'

Members of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, who usually deal with beached animals, are at the scene

The nearest sea to the animal's location is the estuary of the River Mersey in Liverpool - seven miles away
