A mother who went from a vivacious young woman to a drunken wreck has been handed an Asbo after terrorising neighbours with a series of raucous parties at her home.

Photographs reveal that in just five months of binging, Rebecca Proctor was transformed from looking healthy and fresh-faced to being haggard and sullen, with local children dubbing her 'The Attic Monster'.

The 28-year-old constantly drank Lambrini and had a stream of friends to her house in Burnley, Lancashire for all-night parties accompanied by drugs and loud music.

The stark deterioration in Proctor's appearance was revealed by comparing photos taken by friends and uploaded to Facebook in April with her police mugshot, taken when her Asbo was imposed last week.

She has now been forced to leave her home, and banned from her regular haunts such as local shopping centres.

If Proctor, a mother of one, returns to the house and causes further distress to neighbours she could be jailed for up to five years.

Reedley Magistrates' Court imposed the order after hearing that she was 'repeatedly responsible for causing noise nuisance and displaying drunk and disorderly behaviour'.

After: She became addicted to drinking Lambrini and other types of alcohol during her binge sessions

Proctor's former neighbours welcomed the decision to evict her from the area, describing how she would keep them awake with parties which went on for up to five days at a time.

One said: 'It's an absolute total relief to the neighbourhood that she's gone, and it's fair to say we've had our first peaceful night's sleep in ages.

'Rebecca was nothing but a drunk and a terrible drunk at that. She may look as though butter would not melt in some of her pictures but the reality was she was nothing but trouble.

'She would have three or four blokes around every weekend and they would be sat there drinking for England and taking drugs. It was disgusting.

'When she first moved in she was alright and I tried to help her. I even mended her child's bike and helped her out with odd jobs. But then she lost it and her true colours shone through ever since.

'Sadly it was the drink which took over her life and she's been a constant source of problems round her. It was parties every weekend and we couldn't sleep. It would just be noise from them shouting more than noise from music.

'Sometimes it was just a couple of them, and sometimes it was four or five people and they would be out here in front of our house and in the street drinking and taking drugs.

'Sometimes she would be downstairs with people having a party when her child was upstairs. It was nightmare living next door to her.'

The 52-year-old woman, who gave evidence at Proctor's Asbo hearing, added: 'Sometimes parties would go on from Thursday until Monday. They would sleep in the day when we're at work and in the night be all shouting and drinking.

'I believe she is seeking treatment for her alcohol abuse and she says she has managed to curb her drinking - but only from two bottles of Lambrini a day to one and a half.'

Natalie Whittaker from Lancashire Police said: 'This Asbo is an excellent result for local residents who were being kept up until all hours because of noise and excessive drinking by Rebecca Proctor.

'They had really had enough and I hope that this result will enable them to sleep without disruption.

'I hope this sends out a clear message that police and other agencies will not tolerate this type of behaviour and will take firm action against those involved in anti-social behaviour.'
