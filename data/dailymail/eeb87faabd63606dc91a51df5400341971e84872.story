A passenger has recorded video of the terrifying moment flames shot out of a Lufthansa plane’s engine after striking a flock of birds off the coast of Lebanon.

The bird strike occurred moments after the Airbus A321 took off from Beirut’s international airport en route to Frankfurt.

The plane was carrying 144 passengers when it lost power in one of its two engines and was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing in Beirut.

Footage recorded by the passenger shows bright flashes of light outside the window as birds were sucked into the left engine over the Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday morning.

In slow motion, the footage shows flames shooting out of the engine as it failed, illuminating the left wing as the plane ascended shortly before 5am local time.

Passengers applauded and cheered when the plane landed safely about 10 minutes later.

The person who recorded the footage wrote online: ‘Thirty-six seconds after take-off we were already above the sea, we heard the sound of two brutal explosions from the engine underneath.

Flight DLH1307 was forced to turn around and land at Beirut's international airport after hitting a flock of birds

‘The aircraft started shaking and vibrating. It also smelled burning from the inside.’

A Lufthansa spokesman told MailOnline Travel: ‘The aircraft landed safe and all passengers left the aircraft over the normal stairs.

‘All passengers have been offered hotel accommodation and were rebooked on other airlines and on our scheduled daily services.’ 

The bird strike involving flight DLH1307 prompted a warning from Lebanese aviation authorities, who told pilots to exercise ‘extreme caution’, the Daily Star reported.

Daniel al-Haiby, director general of Lebanon’s Civil Aviation Authority, told the newspaper that bird strikes are common at this time of year due to bird migration near Beirut’s international airport.
