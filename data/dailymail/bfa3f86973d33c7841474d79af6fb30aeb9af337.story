Anderson Cooper is opening up one of his Hamptons homes to renters this summer for a cool $150,000.

And because the CNN anchor owns the home next door, there's always the chance to share a few beers come the Fourth of July.

Living like a blueblood in the quaint hamlet of Quiogue will cost you though.Â  While renting the home from Memorial Day to Labor Day is $150,000 - the home can also be rented on a monthly basis. The cost for June is $30,000 while July goes for 60,000 and August to Labor Day is $80,000.

This six-bedroom home in the tony Hamptons could be yours for $150,000. CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who luckily owns TWO homes, is renting his newer purchase out

Neighbors: Cooper also owns the home next door which means prospective renters can look forward to being the CNN anchor's neighbor - at least for three months

Cooper, who is the son of socialite and jeans designer Gloria Vanderbilt, purchased the home two years ago, talking down the asking price of $3.5million to a steal of $1.7million.

A source told the New York Post at the time that Cooper bought to property to make sure it wasn't torn down and replaced by a McMansion.

The home was built in 1946 and was previously owned by Hollywood screen writer Budd Schulberg who penned 1954's 'On the Waterfront' there.

In 2003 he paid $1,150,000 for his first home, next door to the rental.

Since becoming the new owner of the pedigreed Quogue home, Cooper has completely renovated the six-bedroomsh the help of a 'well-known' designer, according to listing agents at Douglas Elliman.

Features of the home include views of Aspatuck Creek, a heated pool, white chef's kitchen and a separate above-garage apartment.

The waterfront great room comes with a brick fireplace, vaulted ceiling and french doors which lead out to the patio on the creek.

To escape the blistering summer heat, renters can chill in the air conditioning in the den while watching a movie on the 60-inch television or take a dip in the gunite pool.

Anderson reportedly purchased the home for rent two years ago, seen left, in order to prevent a McMansion from being put up in its place. He has owned the home next door for over a decade

The pool area also has a Jacuzzi and pool house with bathroom and a sitting room.

The home has one master suite and three other bedrooms for guests. In addition to the rooms inside the home, a breezeway leads to an above-garage apartment with its own living area, bedroom and full bathroom.

The home up for rent is just one in Cooper's expanding real estate portfolio.

In the New York City, Cooper lives in a renovated firehouse in Greenwich Village with boyfriend Benjamin Maisani. He purchased the home in September 2009 for $4.3million.
