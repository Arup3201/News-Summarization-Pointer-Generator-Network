Cannabis growers have been caught using a clothes horse to dry drugs in their house after police spotted a six foot cannabis bush in the garden.

One of the biggest ever found, the bush was so tall it was visible over the garden fence as it was seized by police when they raided two houses in the Bournville area, Weston-super-Mare today.

Police also found cannabis buds drying next to radiators and on a clothes horse while buds in jars and weapons were found in the house next door as well as a partially cultivated plant in the garden.

Neighbourhood beat manager Andy Vallender was on the scene and searched the addresses.

He said: ‘While we obviously had information to prompt us going to the houses, we did not expect to find anything like the size of plants and quantity of cannabis.

‘People need to understand that cultivating cannabis is against the law and we will act on any information we get about people growing it.

‘When you consider the other things seized - the scales, the money, the weapons - you can see it is not a harmless pastime.’

The raid comes after an elderly couple were busted for growing cannabis after unknowingly buying a plant at a car boot sale.

who seized the bush in a drugs bust at the couple's Bedford home on 
Friday.

The couple were shocked to find that their carefully tended 
shrub was in fact a gigantic cannabis plant.

They had bought the plant as a shrub at a car boot sale, without realising that is was a cannabis bush.

Website howtogrowmarijuna.com said that despite many cannabis farms being hidden in the roofs of homes, the species actually benefit from natural sunlight in gardens.
