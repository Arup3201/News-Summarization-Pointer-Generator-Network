Lewis Holtby has admitted he could be moving on from Tottenham Hotspur this summer due to a lack of first-team action at White Hart Lane.

The former Schalke midfielder has been linked with a return to the Bundesliga with Hamburg, and he admits it may well be an attractive prospect.

'We're just going to have to see what happens in the next few days and weeks,' he told t-online.de.

'I'm a young player and I want to be playing all the time. That's very important for me, for my development and for my career.'

Holtby, who finishes last season on loan at Fulham, has found his opportunities limited at Spurs with new coach Mauricio Pochettino not giving him much consideration in the first few weeks of the season.

Decisions, decisions: With transfer deadline day approaching, the German needs to decide whether to go on loan or fight for a first team position at White Hart Lane 

Happier times: Holtby scores in Spurs' 2-1 win against Fulham last season (left) and celebrates with Eric Dier (right) in their 1-0 win against West Ham on the opening weekend 

However Holtby, who has a contract until 2018 with Spurs, still hopes he will get to prove his worth in London.

'Preferably, I would stay here with Tottenham of course and that's why I really hope that I get a chance,' he added.
