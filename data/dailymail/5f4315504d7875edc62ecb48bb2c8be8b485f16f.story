The leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees say the terrorism threat against the United States is increasing and Americans aren't as safe as they were a year or two ago.

Senator Dianne Feinstein says there are more terrorist groups than ever, with more sophisticated and hard-to-detect bombs.

The California Democrat says ‘there is huge malevolence out there’.

Terror: The leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees, Senator Dianne Feinstein, right, and Mike Rogers, left, say the terrorism threat against the United States is increasing

Michigan Republican Mike Rogers says there's enormous pressure on U.S. intelligence services ‘to get it right, to prevent an attack’.

Rogers says that job is getting more difficult because al-Qaida is changing, with more affiliates around the world. He says those groups that once operated independently of Al-Qaida have now joined them.

The lawmakers spoke on CNN's State of the Union in an interview aired Sunday.

Feinstein and Rogers agreed that despite the death of Osama bin Laden and drone strikes aimed at decimating al Qaeda's leadership, President Barack Obama's administration has lost ground in the on-going battle with global terrorism.

Rogers warned that the Obama administration's successes against high-value targets have fostered a false sense of security.

‘People think that, well, we've got this thing beat,’ Rogers said. ‘And that's just not the case.’

Feinstein said increasingly fundamentalist Islamist groups are gaining power and winning the minds of the disenfranchised in the Middle East and Near Asia.

‘I see more groups; more fundamentalist, more jihadist, more determined to kill to get to where they want to get,’ Feinstein said.

As evidence the U.S. is in greater danger, the California lawmaker cited a rise in fatalities from terrorist-related activities and increasingly specialized and dangerous technology available to terrorists.

Feinstein specifically highlighted bombs as a growing threat to American security - and not the kind of improvised devices that plagued U.S. armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, or rudimentary explosives like the pressure-cooker bomb used by the Boston marathon bombers.

She said terror groups had already tried, on four separate occasions, to send these newer, more deadly explosives into the United States.

‘There are new bombs, very big bombs, trucks being reinforced for those bombs,’ Feinstain told CNN.

‘There are bombs that go through (metal-detecting) magnetometers.’

‘Al-Qaida as we knew it before is metastasizing to something different,’ Rogers said.

Rogers said the terrorist network has changed its modus operandi. Rather than placing a premium on large-scale terror attacks - like those of September 11, 2001, and embassy bombings throughout the 1990s - the new breed of Al-Qaida is more decentralized, he said, something that will make it ’exponentially’ harder to stop the next attack from happening.

‘They've now switched to this notion that smaller events are OK, so if you have more smaller events than bigger events, they think that might still lead to their objectives and their goals,’ Rogers said.

Rogers said the potency of the Al-Qaida threat comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of the American intelligence apparatus working to root out the next terror events.

‘The pressure on our intelligence services to get it right, to prevent an attack, are enormous,’ Rogers said.

Rogers said the revelations about the agency's methods of surveillance have already prompted three Al-Qaida affiliates to change the way they communicate.

They now feel smaller events are equally as good to target as big events which makes it difficult to anticipate and detect an attack
