Binge drinking among teenagers has led to a ‘meteoric’ rise in alcohol-related deaths, a leading doctor warned yesterday.

Professor Ian Gilmore said too many children were getting drunk on a regular basis – and some of them would die in their twenties as a result.

Sir Ian, who is the country’s leading authority on liver disease, has called for urgent government action and accused David Cameron of backing down over minimum pricing per unit and other controls.

‘It is tragic to see young people 
coming into hospital and dying of alcohol-related liver disease,’ said 
the president of the British Society of Gastroenterology. ‘Liver 
specialists are seeing people as young as in their 20s dying due to 
alcohol.’

Sir Ian said 
he was concerned by the number of people drinking while their brains 
were still developing: ‘We could see up to a quarter of a million 
preventable deaths from liver disease in the next 20 years.’

Speaking
at a conference in London hosted by the charity Alcohol Concern, the 
professor said a recorded four-fold rise in deaths from liver disease 
was ‘meteoric’.

Cirrhosis claimed 1,200 lives a year in 1970 but the toll in 2010 was 5,000 and rising.

The
UK and Ireland are the only Western European countries where deaths 
from liver diseases are on the increase. ‘No other disease has shown 
anything like this,’ added Sir Ian.

The conference also heard that alcohol-related admissions to UK hospitals are at an all-time high of 1.2million a year.

According
to a survey carried out in 2011, 30 per cent of girls and 25 per cent 
of boys reported being drunk in the previous 30 days.

Prof Gilmore said he was ‘very encouraged when David Cameron as Prime Minister made a personal commitment to the value of bringing in a minimum unit price for alcohol’.

But he added that he had since been disappointed that the promise appeared to have been dropped.

‘I am aware that in politics there are difficult decisions and trade-offs,’ he said.

‘My guess is that factors for the change of position would be pressure from the drinks industry and concerns from MPs that the person who is not well off and drinks responsibly would be disadvantaged.

‘The Secretary of State, Jeremy Hunt, is not following the evidence on how we can reduce alcohol-related liver diseases in terms of availability, promotion and pricing of alcohol.

‘Instead, regulation is getting laxer - we hear the Government is considering changes to licensing laws so people can get a gin and tonic when having their hair cut.’

Prof Gilmore said minimum prices per unit would not affect the cost of drinks in pubs or restaurants - and only mean a slight increase for moderate drinkers.

And he said an experimental ban on bulk discounts for alcohol has seen a 4.5 per cent decrease in wine sales over 12 months to October 2012.

As well as minimum pricing, Prof Gilmore suggested district hospitals should create Alcohol Care Teams to work with people admitted with drink-related conditions and help them reduce their consumption.

Prof Gilmore said these teams could save £1.6 million a year by reducing future admissions at a cost of £600,000 a year per hospital.
