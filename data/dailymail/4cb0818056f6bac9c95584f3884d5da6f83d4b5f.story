Choosing your wedding dress is probably the biggest style decision a woman will ever make and as wedding season begins once again, brides-to-be should heed the warning of celebrities who have got their outfit oh so wrong on their big day.

While the style of dress chosen by each 
bride is deeply personal, common themes of the list of the most style 
challenged bridal frocks were 'meringue' type dresses along the lines of
 'My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding', and those that veered too far from the 
traditional shades of ivory, white and cream. 

Topping the list of examples not to follow is model Katie Price, who it is seems is as unlucky with her wedding dresses as with her marriages.

An example not to follow: Katie Price has featured three times in a top 10 worst wedding dresses list - and topped the list for the shocking pink number she wore in her nuptials to Peter Andre in 2005, pictured

Fashion: In at number four was the dress Katie Price wore for her wedding to Kieran Hayler, pictured

Three strikes: Tenth place went again to Katie Price for the dress she wore to marry Alex Reid in 2010

All three of Katie Price’s wedding dresses have featured in the 10 worst celebrity wedding frocks of all time.

The pink puffy gown Katie Price wore to marry Peter Andre in 2005 won the title scooping a quarter, 25 per cent of the vote.

Celine Dion was runner up in second place with 20 per cent
 of the vote for her The Age of Innocence inspired dress, complete with a
 huge Swarovski crystal tiara which she wore to marry René Angélil in 
1994. 

Third
 place went to Emma Thompson with 18 per cent of the vote for the 
untraditional colourful wedding dress she wore to marry Kenneth Brannagh
 in 1989. 

Katie 
Price appeared again at number four with 11 per cent  of the vote for 
her most recent dress, which she wore to marry Kieran Hayler.

Katie Price chose the bubble-gum pink dress, consisting of a sequined low cut bodice and huge tulle skirt, for her nuptials to Peter Andre

Respondents thought the asymmetric dress lacked class and were surprised she wore it on her big day.

Fifth position went to Nicole Richie, who received nine per cent of the vote for her extremely puffy wedding dress.

Joint
 sixth place went to daughter of the Earl of Wemyss, Lady Mary Charteris
 and Jada Pinkett Smith, wife of Will Smith, each receiving five per 
cent of the vote for their dresses.

Those
 questioned commented that Jada’s dress looked too tight and restricting
 and that Lady Mary Charteris’ cut out wedding dress, which was designed
 by the same designer who has dressed Lady Gaga, was far too revealing.

The Emanuel designed Princess Diana wedding dress came in at eighth place with four per cent of the vote.

Celine Dion got 20 per cent of the vote for her The Age of Innocence inspired dress, complete with a huge Swarovski crystal tiara which she wore to marry Rene Angelil in 1994

Third place went to Emma Thompson with 18% of the vote for the dress she wore to marry Kenneth Brannagh in 1989 (L). Gwen Stefani’s wedding dress, which was dip dyed pink received 2% of the vote (R)

8. Princess Diana

9. Gwen Stefani

10. Katie Price (Alex Reid wedding)

Although it was admired at the time, respondents said the dress looked a bit excessive and overdone with the 25-foot train. 

Pop star Gwen Stefani’s wedding dress, which was dip dyed shocking pink only received two per cent of the vote and last place went again to Katie Price for the dress she wore to marry Alex Reid with only one per cent.

A spokesperson for Wrappler.com, who conducted the survey, said: 'Celebrities inspire many people’s fashion choices and everyone loves a celebrity wedding.

'Perhaps 
Nicole’s gown was too puffy for the public and although Diana’s dress 
was wonderfully made, I can understand why the public thought her dress 
looked excessive.

'Fashions change overtime and when you compare it with 
Kate Middleton’s more fitted dress, you can see how fashion has 
transformed. 

'It
 is no surprise that Katie Price topped the public’s vote for the worst 
celebrity wedding dress. Her dresses are always far from traditional, 
maybe next time she’ll finally get it right.'

One
 voter said: 'I voted for Emma Thompson for the worst celebrity wedding 
dress just because her dress looked nothing like a wedding dress. I 
think it’s important to stick to a traditional white dress on a wedding 
day.

'I
 also think that Lady Mary Charteris’s dress was far too revealing to 
get married in and Celine Dion’s just looked over the top.'

The Emanuel designed Princess Diana wedding dress came in at eighth place with four per cent of the vote
