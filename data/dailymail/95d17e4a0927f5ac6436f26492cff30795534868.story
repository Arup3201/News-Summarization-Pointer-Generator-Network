Ravel Morrison may have been cast into the shadows by West Ham but he's found a way to fill his free time while on loan at Cardiff.

The controversial former Manchester United youngster posted a snap on Instagram as he did his French homework.

Attacking midfielder Morrison has found his feet back in the Championship with the South Wales club after failing to break into Sam Allardyce's set-up at Upton Park.

The 21-year-old is no stranger to the Championship after impressing during a loan spell at QPR last season, notching six goals as Rangers sealed promotion to the Premier League.

Former Hammers boss Harry Redknapp believes Morrison is one of the most talented players he's seen, but has issues with his attitude.

In his new book A Man Walks On To a Pitch, serialised in Sportsmail, Redknapp said of Morrison's loan spell at Loftus Road: 'There was one game last season when we'd lost confidence and were losing. I asked him to change his position, to play on the left. His face fell into a petulant pout.

'I pulled him away from the rest, took him outside and explained as patiently as the time allowed. "Ravel, we are losing the f****** game," I said. "I just want you to play there and do a job for the team. We have to win the game. It's not about you, OK? It's about the team. People look at your face in there when I've asked you to do something, and they will all go away and think you are a big-headed b******, because your attitude stinks. That's what people say about you".

'Second half he was absolutely different class. He ran the game, everything good we did came from him and we were all watching it thinking, "What a talent". 

'You looked at that performance and thought he could get us promoted on his own if he put his mind to it. It was like watching a player with Gareth Bale's class in the Championship.' 

West Ham co-owner David Sullivan says time is running out for Morrison if he wants a future at Upton Park

In a recent Q&A with the Evening Standard, West Ham co-owner David Sullivan echoed Redknapp's thoughts on the maverick playmaker, admitting time is running out for Morrison if he wants to forge a long-term future for himself at Upton Park.

He said: 'The biggest disappointment is Ravel is such a talented individual.

'Thousands of kids would give anything to have his ability. Maybe the penny will drop eventually but his contract is up next summer.

'We all love him but we can't do it all for him. He has to do it himself.'
