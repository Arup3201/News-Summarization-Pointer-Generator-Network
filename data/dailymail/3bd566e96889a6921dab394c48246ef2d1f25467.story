More than 400,000 people have spent Thanksgiving without power as a nor'easter causes chaos across the East Coast and forces the cancellation of more than 700 flights in holiday travel misery.

Snow fell in every state from Virginia to Maine as Winter Coast Storm Cato hit its peak - by Wednesday evening 6.7 inches of snow fell in Albany, New York, breaking a single-day record.

In Towanda, Pennsylvania Wayne Vanderpool, National Weather Service Co-Op Observer, reported that he measured 11.2 inches of snow, 'with it still snowing lightly.' 

He said it was 'the most snow ever measured in Towanda on any November day, since records began back in 1895,' reports the Daily Review.

Later Thursday snow is expected in Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and interior New England, according to ABC News.  

The sloppy mix of rain and snow rolled into the Northeast on Wednesday just as millions of Americans began the big Thanksgiving getaway. 

Numerous traffic accidents were reported across the Northeast, where by midafternoon the line between rain and snow ran roughly along Interstate 95, the chief route between Washington and Boston.

Schools and businesses also closed in some areas, and state government offices let workers go home early.

Pat Green and her husband drove from Saugerties, New York, to the Albany airport for the first leg of their trip to San Francisco. She said the drive on the New York State Thruway was 'a little hairy,' but they made it, and their flight was on schedule so far.

'It was snowing so hard you couldn't see the car ahead of you,' she said. 'We slowed down so we were fine. We also give ourselves a lot of extra time.'

Major Northeast cities were likely to see moderate to heavy rain most of the day, though New York could see 1 to 4 inches of snow, and its northern suburbs 6 to 8 inches, the National Weather Service said. Higher elevations west of the I-95 corridor could see as much as 6 to 12 inches.

Dan Albert hoped to beat the snow as he, his wife and 15-year-old daughter refueled their SUV Wednesday morning along I-81 in Hagerstown, Maryland, about halfway between their Greensboro, North Carolina, home and their Thanksgiving destination in Mahwah, New Jersey.

'Traffic was fine last night, no problems at all, but today's going to be a real booger,' Albert said. 

But he added: 'Got to see the folks. We only get to see them once a year. Got to muscle through it, right?'

Abdullah Masud, a lawyer who lives in Kuwait, was heading from Boston to Washington with a cousin.

'We were originally planning on leaving Wednesday morning, but when we heard about the snowstorm we changed our mind and left Tuesday night. But I don't think it made that much of a difference,' he said, noting the heavy traffic.

By early afternoon, airlines had canceled more than 10 percent of their flights at Philadelphia, Newark Liberty and LaGuardia airports.

The wintry weather was not confined to the Northeast. An Alberta clipper left many highways in North and South Dakota slick, and a winter storm warning was issued for parts of Minnesota.

An estimated 41.3 million travelers are expected to hit the nation's highways between Wednesday and Sunday, a 4.3 percent increase over last year, according to AAA.

Kevin Roth, a meteorologist at The Weather Channel said the conditions in areas can change dramatically. 

Roth said the cut-off line between heavy and light snow was likely to be very abrupt.

'Someone could go from an inch in the southeast of a city and drive 10 miles northwest and find themselves in more than 10 inches,' he said, reports NBC News.  

On Wednesday Governor Chris Christie said in New Jersey: 'Today's storm is expected to produce travel hazards and potentially cause power outages throughout the state.'

'I've authorized state officials to take all necessary action to prepare, and my administration will continue monitoring conditions throughout the remainder of the storm.

'With higher than normal traffic volume due to the Thanksgiving holiday, I strongly encourage all New Jerseyans to drive carefully so that they and their families arrive safely at their destinations. ' 

Major airlines dropped their ticket-change fees for people flying in and out of the Northeast, allowing passengers to try to sneak on an earlier flight, though that appeared to be a challenging proposition since most planes were filled. 

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty airports, said it was lining up extra staff and snow removal equipment in the event of a heavy snowfall.

Crews were prepared to work in 12-hour shifts if necessary, officials said.

TThe AAA recommended that the 41 million road travelers due to drive over Thanksgiving choose to  wait until Thursday in order to dodge the storm.

Some travelers did not wait for the precipitation to start before heading for their holiday dinner tables.

'I don't want to risk it,' said Jenna Bouffard, a New York City public relations executive who headed for her family home in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, a day earlier than she had planned

'I'd rather be safe than sorry, and if it doesn't snow, then I just have an extra day at home with my family.'
