Two math-notebook pages recently authenticated as belonging to Abraham Lincoln suggest the 16th president, who was known to downplay his formal education, may have spent more time in school than usually thought.

And the Illinois State University math professors behind the discovery say the work shows Lincoln was no slouch, either.

Math professors Nerida Ellerton and Ken Clements said Friday at the university in Normal that they'd recently confirmed that the two pages were part of a previously known math notebook from Lincoln's childhood. It was found in the archives of Houghton Library at Harvard University, where it remains.

It had long been thought that Lincoln, who was an avid-reader, was mainly self-educated as well. However it now appears the future President did attend classes for a time over a period of three to five years.

Facts: Here is one of two pages from President Lincoln's math notebook believed to be the oldest surviving document written by Abraham Lincoln. The pages are from the 1820s

The book, known as a cyphering book in Lincoln's day, is a sort math workbook in which Lincoln wrote math problems and their answers. It's the oldest known Lincoln manuscript.

Based on the difficulty of the problems involved and dates on some of the pages - 1824 and, on the recently authenticated pages, 1826, when Lincoln was 17 - Lincoln likely worked in the book intermittently over several calendar years while his family lived in Indiana, the married professors said. They think he could have started as early as the age of 10 and believe his work happened while he was in school.

School days: The professors say the papers from the notebook show Lincoln may have attended school during parts of several years. That's more than usually believed

'Most people say he went to school for anything between three months and nine months' over the course of his life, Clements said. 'We think he went to school (up to) two years.'

And very little of the work is wrong, he added.

'He made very few errors, and he 
always knew what he was trying to do,' Clements added. 'We've studied 
thousands of these cyphering books. You don't always get the feeling 
that `this guy knew what he was doing.'

The
professors' find suggests Lincoln may have gone to school over as many 
as three to five winters, according to historian Daniel Stowell, 
director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln project at the Abraham Lincoln
Presidential Library in Springfield. The library owns one previously 
identified page of the book.

'They
are arguing with some merit that a cyphering book would have been 
created in a school setting,' Stowell said. 'It does at least open the 
possibility that he may have had more formal schooling than originally 
thought. Not a whole lot more, but still more.'

The
pages - attached as a single leaf - include word problems that are the 
equivalent of roughly eighth-grade modern work, Clements said.

'If 100 dollars in one year gain 3 1/2 dollars interest, what sum will gain $38.50 cents in one year and a quarter?' one reads.

Figures: Lincoln's stepmother gave the notebook to Lincoln law partner William Herndon after the 16th president's death

Any student doing such work in the 1820s would have been more advanced than most on the frontier in Indiana, Clements said.

'If you got to that stage, you'd sort of done well,' he said.

Lincoln is known to have later studied trigonometry and geometry on his own.

The
newly authenticated pages have been in the Harvard library's archives 
since 1954. They were known as Lincoln documents, but their origin 
wasn't known, the professors said. The two looked at the documents as 
they researched a book they've written on math books from the period.

A
letter from former Lincoln law partner William Herndon from 1875 that 
accompanied the papers, describing them, made the authentication 
relatively straightforward, Clements said.

Lincoln's
stepmother, Sarah Bush Lincoln, gave the cyphering book to Herndon 
after Lincoln's death, and Herndon then gave them to other people, 
Stowell said.
