George W Bush doesn't readily offer political opinions.

But when it comes to portraits, he has some broad-brush advice.

'Never paint your wife or your mother.'

Bush's new book about his father includes a portrait he painted of his dad, the 41st president.

A word of warning: George W Bush said his wife did not like his painting of her so it won't see the light of day 

Strong critics: The former president's mother (pictured) is also critical of his work, Bush revealed

Bush tells CNN's 'State of the Union' that 'I think it's nice,' but his tough-to-please mother 'kind of wasn't' happy with it.

The 43rd president also painted his wife, Laura. 

The verdict?

She didn't like it and neither did one of their daughters, 'so I just scrapped it.'

Well, maybe not.

'I may have saved it although they probably think I destroyed it.'

Broad brush strokes: All of the paintings, like this self portrait, are created using thick lines and bold colors

Bush has said that an essay by Winston Churchill on painting inspired him to take lessons after leaving office.

Speaking about his artistic process, he told the Today Show: 'I was very proud to be standing next to a man I admire greatly. 

'First thing I wanted to make sure is I got the noses right. I've tried to paint a gentle soul, and I did it. As for me, I kind of bumbled through.' 

Last year, a hacker leaked his images of animals, landscapes and self portraits, such as him in the bath.

'I was annoyed,' Bush said. 'It's an invasion of one's privacy... nor do I want my paintings to get out.

'The truth of the matter is my paintings are not ready to be released. I mean, I'm still learning, and I don't know if they ever will be or not.'

He also reflected on what others think of his work.

'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.'

In March last year, an artist who taught Bush how to paint both animals and landscapes in a recent month-long course spoke out his skills as a late-in-life painter.

He had spent four weeks in private lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic horizons.

'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood.
