Could a T-shirt improve your posture?

The makers of the Up Couture T-shirt would certainly like you to believe so.

Their new T-shirt, designed in France, has just launched in the UK and claims it can, ‘through its innovative, patented, flexible’ design which ‘encourages the holding of the shoulders in a beautiful position’ give you ‘a dream posture.’

Of course this isn't the first bit of kit designed to get us sitting upright with our shoulders back.

A new T-shirt, called Up Couture, has just launched in the UK and claims it can give you 'a dream posture'

Last year M&S launched their £25 Perfect Poise posture bra, while Shoulders Back, £37.99, is a slightly complicated looking strap and harness contraption that was originally developed to help horse riders sit up straight but has become popular with everyone from nurses to yoga fans.

But this is the first time such technology has been put into a T-shirt.

So how does it work?

From the outside it looks like a simple white cotton T-shirt but turn it inside out and you'll find a stiffer blue fabric that's bonded to the cotton in a pattern that goes across the top part of the back, over the shoulders and around the upper arms.

The idea is that the stiffer fabric should sit flat against your back - as it will when you have your shoulder blades back and down, and your back flat.

The company says that the T-shirt is made in France from very specialist materials using a very time-consuming process which, they maintain, justifies the £108 price

But start to curve your back or bring your shoulders forward, and the stiffer fabric won't flex with you, so you feel some resistance across your back, shoulders and upper arms, sort of strait-jacket lite, if you will.

Apparently the T-shirt is ‘most efficient when it is fitted’ basically if you’re undecided, opt for a smaller size. As I usually wear a 10-12, I go for the Small, which is equivalent to a 10.

It's nicely cut - although could do with being a little bit longer in the body - and just looks like a normal white t-shirt, albeit quite a tight one.

I can feel it pulling across my shoulders - which is of course the point as it reminds me to pull my shoulders back.

Unfortunately - maybe because I'm too easily distracted - the reminder doesn't last for long. All too soon with an urgent email and a couple of phone calls vying for my attention, my shoulders are rounding and yes, while feeling the shirt pull across my back and at the tops of my arms is not terribly comfortable, it's not so painful that it's forefront of my mind.

What is painful is the price - €127 or a staggering £108. For that, I want something that's going to give me the deportment of a ballerina who's spent three years at a Swiss finishing school, not something that allows me to slump back into my previous poor posture without much effort or discomfort.

The company says that the T-shirt is made in France from very specialist materials using a very time-consuming process which, they maintain, justifies the price.

Personally, I'm not convinced - maybe if your concentration is better than mine, or your bank balance is bigger, it's a worthwhile investment, but with proven posture prompters that are less expensive, I won't be bending over to get my wallet out of my bag for this one.
