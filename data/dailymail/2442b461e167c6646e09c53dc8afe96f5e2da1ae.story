President Barack Obama has welcomed the Ukrainian Prime Minister to the White House and issued a stern warning to Russia about any plans to continue their occupation of Crimea.

Mr Obama said that if Russia continues an aggressive path in Ukraine, the United States and other countries will, in his words, be ‘forced to apply costs’ to Moscow.

Obama referred to the Russian military presence in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and said the greatest threat facing Ukraine is to its territorial integrity.

Together on the issue: President Obama welcomed Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to the White House on Wednesday amid the ongoing crisis in his country

Serious issue: President Obama has continued to speak out against the Russian occupation of Crimea which started as the Ukraine was in political turmoil following a crackdown on protestors and the exile of their former prime minister

Obama made his remarks after meeting with Ukraine's new prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, at the White House in a display of support for the fledgling government.

Yatsenyuk said Ukraine will ‘never surrender’ in a fight over its territory.

The Crimean regional government has scheduled a referendum Sunday on whether to separate from Ukraine and join the Russian federation.

Obama said he will stand with Ukraine in ensuring that its territorial integrity is maintained.

In addition to issuing warnings, Obama expressed hope Wednesday that a referendum on the future of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula can be halted, as he met with the new leader of the former Soviet republic.

Sitting side by side in the Oval Office with Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Obama said he hoped last-ditch diplomatic efforts might lead to a 'rethinking' of Sunday's Russian-backed referendum.

Symbolic: The Ukrainian Prime Minister's visit shows how closely the turbulent government is aligning itself with the United Staets

Diplomatic talks: Yatsenyuk  also paid a visit to the State Department and spoke with Secretary of State John Kerry who traveled to Kiev earlier this month

If the vote does occur, Obama said, 'We will not recognize any referendum that goes forward.'

Obama and Yatsenyuk met as the Senate began considering a package of both possible new sanctions on Russia and economic aid to Ukraine.

The bill stops short of going after Russian banks or energy companies as some legislators proposed, but it would give Secretary of State John Kerry more leeway as he readies for diplomatic talks with his Russian counterpart in Europe on Friday.

Yatsenyuk, a 39-year-old pro-Western official, took control in late February after Ukraine's pro-Russian president fled after three months of political protests.

First handshake: Obama's meeting with Yatsenyuk amounted to a diplomatic dig against Russia, which does not recognize Ukraine's new government

Looking on: Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry were in the Oval Office for the historic meeting

With Ukraine now caught in a diplomatic battle between East and West, Yatsenyuk said Russia must recognize that his country can have ties with both.

'Ukraine is and will be part of the Western world,' Yatsenyuk said, speaking in fluent English.

Obama's meeting with Yatsenyuk amounted to a diplomatic dig against Russia, which does not recognize Ukraine's new government.

Russia has moved military forces into Crimea, a pro-Russian area that will vote Sunday on whether to become part of Russia or remain in Ukraine with broader powers.

Obama urged Congress to quickly approve the $1billion loan guarantee to help Ukraine's fledgling government.

That guarantee is supposed to supplement $15billion in assistance from the European Union, as well as additional money from the International Monetary Fund.
