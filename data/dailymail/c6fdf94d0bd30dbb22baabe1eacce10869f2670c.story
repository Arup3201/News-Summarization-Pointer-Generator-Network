Antique jewelry made out of real human hair is once again being worn by collectors who are intrigued by the deeply personal keepsakes, which were originally created as a sign of affection or mourning.

Wearing an accessory crafted out of a loved one's hair may sound creepy, but wearing jewelry containing the lopped-off locks was a common practice in the United States and Europe throughout the late-Georgian and Victorian eras - and now, it seems, the trend is back in fashion.

'I think part of the reason people are fascinated by it is that it does repulse on a certain level,' jewelry collector Evan Michelson told Racked.  

Hairy situation: Jewelry made out of human hair was widely popular throughout the late-Georgian and Victorian eras

Morbid memento: Mourning jewelry, created out of a deceased person's hair, was worn to remember the dead

'It's powerfully charged because hair really affects people on this visceral level.' 

Ms. Michelson, who co-owns antiques store Obscura Antiques, added that buyers are often drawn to the slightly morbid pieces because of the strange emotions that they evoke.

Mourning jewelry fashioned out of the hair of the deceased was worn as a part of the grieving process. Victorian hairwork was also seen as a token of affection for a lover, a family member or a dear friend, similar to a locket or a friendship bracelet. 

Collector, jeweler and scholar Karen Bachmann agrees. 'When I wear hair jewelry, people that know the genre will appreciate it and admire it,' she said to the outlet. 

'But people that don't know it will look and wonder what it is. That also, in a perverse sort of way, is what interests me.'

The sentimental pieces were created out of elaborately woven hair typically set in glass and adorned with gold or gemstones.

Throughout the 19th century, human hair was used to create everything from braided bracelets to brooches. 

Ms. Michelson compared the 'obsessive' attention to detail to 'prison work'.    

'Victorian hairwork is just so well done,' Ms. Michelson explained. 'It takes years of dedication and practice - it was a real craft. 

'The labor involved makes you appreciate the difficult aspect of working with it. I can imagine how working with hair would be an act of devotion, turning these precious relics of someone you love into something more precious.'

The collection of hair jewelry has gained popularity, although Ms. Michelson noted that a one time, 'you couldn't give hairwork away.' 

She recalled that when she first started looking for the unique pieces, she learned that many dealers were disposing of the hair and only selling the expensive antique frames. 

Ms. Bachmann said she was interested in the 'esoteric and odd' when she was an undergraduate student at Pratt and fell in love with Victorian hairwork during that time. 

Both women are avid collectors of hair jewelry.  

'I just can't get enough of it,' Ms. Michelson said. 'It's so beautiful.' 

Ms. Bachmann noted: 'The more I collect it and the more I see the forms that can be made, the more interested I am.'

Hair club: The Victorian Hairwork Society is an internet based organization that brings together those interested in the art of hair jewelry

Both women are personally involved with the Morbid Anatomy Museum in Brooklyn, which opened in June 2014.

Ms. Bachmann is an artist and scholar-in-residence at the museum, while Ms. Michelson is on the board of trustees.

Pieces from their personal collections are a currently on display as apart of 'The Art of Mourning' exhibit, which showcases decorative arts relating to mourning culture from the 18th to the 20th century. 

'It's given me a place to speak about my passion for hair jewelry,' Ms. Bachmann said of the institute.  

For those who are fascinated by hair jewelry but live outside New York City, the Victorian Hairwork Society is an internet based organization that brings together those interested in the history, preservation, restoration and continuation of the art.
