Jane Doe #1 was the first girl to accuse billionaire Jeffrey Epstein (pictured) of sexual abuse

The first girl to accuse billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse has claimed she was 14 when she was paid £130 to give him a massage wearing just her knickers.

The girl, known only as Jane Doe #1, claims she was taken to Epstein's mansion by one of his associates in February 2005 and forced to straddle him as he bragged about his business conquests and 'different girlfriends'.

The teenager - who had been told to lie to Epstein about her age - also claims the disgraced tycoon paid her an extra £65 after masturbating in front of her and using a vibrator on her.

The extraordinary claims come just weeks after Prince Andrew was thrown into the spotlight following a series of lurid allegations about his friendship with Epstein.

The Duke of York has been accused of sleeping with a 'sex slave' who was allegedly loaned out by Epstein to a series of his high-profile friends.

Virginia Roberts - also known on court papers as Jane Doe #3 - alleges she was 17 when she slept with Prince Andrew in 2001, a claim the royal strenuously denied. 

In an unprecedented move last week, the duke used a televised speech in Davos to ‘reaffirm’ Buckingham Palace’s emphatic denials that he had ever had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with his accuser. 

Separately, Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution with a minor and was jailed for 18 months. 

Jane Doe #1's allegations, which she made in 2005 in a series of affidavits to police, led to a wave of alleged victims coming forward and claiming they had also been abused by Epstein at his Florida mansion.

In her first extraordinary interview since the allegations were made, Jane Doe #1 - whose anonymity is protected - told how she was living with her father and step-mother in West Palm Beach, Florida, when she was approached by one of her neighbours and asked if she would like to give a massage to a 'rich man'.

She told The Daily Beast how the woman - who police say admitted being one of Epstein's procurers - told her to pretend she was 18, if asked by Epstein.

She then revealed how she was taken to his El Brillo Way mansion, where an assistant led her to the a fold-out massage table in the bathroom connected to the master bedroom.

It was there she was told to strip down to just her underwear and allegedly presented with a range of lotions to use on the billionaire, she claims. 

Although she was terrified, the girl said she stayed because she did not want Epstein to become suspicious that she had lied about her age.

According to the girl, Epstein then entered wearing just a bath towel and immediately told her to take off her bra.

She said: 'I was a little shrimp, didn't have boobs, and didn't look 18 at all. My face, the way I spoke, and my body didn't look like I was 18.'

During the massage, Jane Doe #1 says Epstein told her about his business conquests and his different girlfriends.

Virginia Roberts, known as Jane Doe #3, has also made allegations against Epstein as well as Prince Andrew. The royal denies the claims 

He also asked her to sit on him 'piggy-back style' to carry out the massage as she was too short to reach him properly, she claims. 

Once the massage was over, Epstein allegedly told her to 'write down your name and telephone number in the little pad next to the couch', before leaving the room.

Jane Doe #1 was taken back to her house and never saw him again.

But the story unraveled after she told her close friend at school about the encounter.

The rumours soon spread around the school and reached the principal, who reported the incident to the police and encouraged Jane Doe #1 to testify against Epstein.

According to Jane Doe #1, she was harassed and 'bullied' by one of Epstein's lawyers during the court proceedings.

But, despite testifying to a court, she says she did not hear from prosecutors until 2008, by which time Epstein had already negotiated the non-prosecution agreement (NPA). 

Experts in criminal law in America still question how Epstein’s legal team pulled off the deal that saw him avoid a jail sentence of ten to 20 years. 

Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, the name used in US legal proceedings for people with anonymity, are now suing the U.S government over the NPAs. 

They claim the government failed to protect their rights when it entered a plea deal with Epstein.

Two more women, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4, now want to join the case. It is the woman known as Jane Doe #3 - Ms Roberts - who has made claims regarding Prince Andrew.

Since Jane Doe #1 made her claims, 40 women have come forward claiming that Epstein abused them too. Almost all have settled their cases.

A spokesman for Epstein declined to comment. He said all Epstein's statements have been and will be made in legal papers filed with the court.
