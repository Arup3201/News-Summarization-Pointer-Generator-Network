Four players involved in a brief brawl at the end of the Super Bowl last Sunday have been fined by the league.

The NFL levied a $10,000 fine against Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bruce Irvin, along with $8,628 fines for Seahawks lineman Michael Bennett and Patriots tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Michael Hoomanawanui.

After New England's Tom Brady kneeled on the five-yard line to kill the last seconds off the game clock, Irvin and Gronkowski began shoving one another.

Fined: The NFL fined Bruce Irvin and Michael Bennett of the Seahawks along with Rob Gronkowski and Michael Hoomanawanui of the Patriots for a late-game brawl 

Another player shoved Irvin through the pile, before more players joined in the scuffle in the end zone.  

Irvin was ejected from the game following the fight. Bennett, Gronkowski, and Hoomanawanui were fined for striking an opponent.  

Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live the day after the game, Gronkowski made light of the incident, feigning ignorance and appealing to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell not to punish him.

'Roger, that wasn't me,' Gronkowski joked. 'Don't fine me.' 

ESPN reports that Irvin tweeted an apology for the fight the day after the game, saying things 'got out of hand.'

'I want to apologize to all of the younger kids for my actions last night,' Irvin wrote. 'I was trying to protect my brother.'

The league handed the biggest fine out to Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin for a touchdown celebration that was dubbed the 'poopdown.'

For squatting over the football in the end zone after his touchdown in the third quarter, Baldwin was slapped with a fine for unsportsmanlike conduct for $11,025.
