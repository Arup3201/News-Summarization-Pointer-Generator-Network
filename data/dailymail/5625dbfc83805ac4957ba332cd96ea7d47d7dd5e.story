Brazil's friendly with Argentina in China is under threat because Beijing is engulfed in smog.

Stars such as Neymar, Lionel Messi and Angel di Maria are all set to play at the Bird's Nest stadium in the Chinese capital on Saturday, but the match could now not even go ahead.

And all the players are now stuck in their hotels after Chinese authorities put out an orange pollution alert.The air quality on Thursday was 18 times worse than the recognised safety level.

'One of the pieces of advice that those responsible for pollution control give is that people should stay indoors and this is what we have done,' said Brazil's team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar.

'Our athletes stay inside the hotel and only go out for training. Out of every 24 hours, they spend 22 inside the hotel.'

Should the fixture go ahead as planned, it will be the first time that the two bitter rivals have met since November 2012.

Brazil coach Dunga urged his team to focus on the football as much as possible, however, acknowledging there was little they could do about the less-than-ideal conditions they will likely face at the Bird's Nest stadium.

He said: 'It is there. It is like when we played at the altitude. We have to face the match. There is nothing we can do about it. Nobody has the power to change it.'

Santos forward Robinho added: 'It is difficult to breathe. The throat remains dry. It seems like we are close to a bonfire, with a lot of heavy smoke. We can not escape from that. The ones who can cope with it best will have the advantage on the pitch.'

The Bird's Nest was the main stadium for the 2008 Olympics, where Usain Bolt became the star of the Games.
