Most of us enjoy a takeaway every now and again but a couple who ate them every day and piled on the pounds as a result have shed more than 13st by learning how to cook them at home.

Katie and Roy Marks, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, embarked on their bid to lose weight after being told they were too fat to have IVF.

Now, Mrs Marks, 30, who once weighed 22st, is now a slimline size 12, while her XXXL husband has also slimmed down with the couple losing an impressive 13st combined.

As a result of their impressive weight loss, the pair will now start IVF treatment in a bid to finally have the family they have always longed for.

'When we wanted to lose weight, we realised that we didn't know how to cook which was really embarrassing,' explained Mrs Marks, a children's nanny.

'We used to eat take-aways at least twice a week and the other days were microwave meals so it was really hard to learn.

'I remember the first meal was a home-cooked meat kebab and we made our own chips as well. We were really surprised it turned out as well as it did and it tasted so lovely.

'We cook everything together now, with the kebabs a firm favourite, and have lost 13st.'

Astonishingly, the pair's new healthy diet isn't all salads either. Both still enjoy full English breakfasts and roast dinners but cook them from scratch and use low-fat ingredients.

Fattening snacks such as chocolate and crisps are out and in their place, lean ham, low-fat quiche and yoghurts.

Looking good: Mrs Marks says learning how to cook proved crucial in their battle to lose weight

What's more, say the couple, their bid to lose weight and learn how to cook has brought them closer together as a couple - saying that they are much happier as a result.

'It has been really supportive having Roy there losing weight with me,' said Mrs Marks. 'We've always done everything together, but now instead of just sitting and watching a film together, we walk the dogs and cook together too.

'Every Wednesday morning before I go to weigh at my Slimming World class, Roy weighs himself first so we can do it together, and we measure our waists together too.

'We have never been competitive and it is just a massive support going through it side by side.'

Their new look is a far cry from the heftier physiques both had at the start of their relationship. When the couple married in 2007, Mrs Marks walked down the aisle in a size 24 wedding dress.

'I was happy at the time,' she admits. 'How I ate and looked was my just my life and what I knew, it didn't affect me at all.'

But that all changed when the couple decided they wanted to start a family and discovered that their weight was playing havoc with their fertility.

'We were back and forwards to the GP as I struggled to get pregnant,' explains Mrs Marks. 'The doctor said my weight would be contributing to problems with fertility.

'I was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and went on to have four miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy. 

'They said I would never be able to fall pregnant by myself naturally. My only hope was IVF treatment.'

Unfortunately for the Marks, the NHS refused to fund IVF treatment until they shed some of the weight and, desperate to have a family, the duo joined a local slimming club.

'I had to have a BMI under 30, and Roy under 35,' said Mrs Marks. 'But me being a size 26 and Roy an XXXL, we were nowhere near.'

'At first I was too embarrassed to go to classes so I tried to lose the weight at home. But over two years I only lost two and a half stone because I didn't know what I was doing.

'I decided enough was enough and joined a Slimming World class. Roy works full time so I went to the class and came back to teach him what I had learned.

'The main thing was to cook everything healthily. The first meal we cooked together was Slimming World Kebab meat and we made our own chips as well. We had never cooked before so it was really hard to start learning.'

Hopes: The newly slimline couple are now having IVF while Mrs Marks has started her own slimming class

Despite being beginners in the kitchen, the couple soon realised they shared a passion for cooking and haven't looked back since.

'We realised we both loved cooking,' adds a delighted Mrs Marks. 'Maybe things would have been different if we had known this before.

'In just one year I lost five and a half stone and now I am a healthy size 12, and Roy lost five stone too.

'Now we cook every night together and walk our dogs together for exercise. It's been great going through it together and we motivate each other to keep going.

'We have a completely different lifestyle and eat so much healthier.'

Better still, the couple are now about to begin IVF treatment having reached the perfect weight, while Mrs Marks is so enthused, she is now running her own weight loss classes.

'It has worked wonders for us,' she added, 'and we have never felt happier.'
