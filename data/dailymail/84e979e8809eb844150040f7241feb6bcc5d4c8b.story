'Patronising': Colin Baker as Dr Who in the 1980s worked with Jimmy Savile on a specially written scene

Former Dr Who Colin Baker claims Jimmy Savile behaved like an overindulged child who lacked professional respect.

Baker, 69, worked with Savile on a specially written Dr Who scene which aired on Jim’ll Fix It in 1985.

The scene had been set up after young boy Gareth Jenkins wrote to Savile asking if he could help him meet Dr Who and travel in the Tardis, the doctor’s famous time machine.

Baker, who played the doctor from 1984 to 1986, said: ‘I met Jimmy Savile briefly in the 1980s when I was working on Dr Who. A young man had written asking if he could “fix it” for him to meet the Doctor and travel in the Tardis.

‘After the lad had saved the day and the Sontarans had been “fixed”, Savile entered the set and did his usual self-congratulatory shtick. 

‘I didn’t warm to him. His demeanour was neither friendly, nor inclusive. He behaved much as one might expect a child to behave who had been indulged and led to believe that life revolved around them.

‘There was certainly none of the professional respect that one would expect to be shared when two programmes combine for a special purpose. Even though we were on the Tardis set, it was very much his territory and his agenda.’

Baker said all the actors had worked hard on the specially written scene, called A Fix with the Sontarans.

He said: ‘A special scene was written, called A Fix with the Sontarans, which we duly rehearsed and recorded.

‘The other actors and I had worked hard over a couple of days to create a relaxed atmosphere, but the first and only time he saw Savile was when he came on the set when the cameras were rolling.

Big difference: Savile kisses Fielding's hand in the scene in which Baker described him as 'creepy and 'patronising' but said that there was a big difference between that and suspecting him of a sexual predator

‘His eyes were cold and his demeanour patronising. I recall clearly the disappointment I felt for the young boy for whom I suspect the whole experience was daunting and overwhelming.

‘At least it was I who got to put the Jim’ll Fix It medallion around his neck.’

'Should have been braver': Baker said there may have been people who could or should have come forward when rumours about Savile surfaced

Speaking on the mounting abuse allegations recently made against Savile, Baker said: ‘There is of course a huge difference between finding someone creepy and patronising and suspecting them of being a sexual predator.

‘I only hope that the BBC’s failure 
to investigate him does not tarnish, in the eyes of the world, an 
organisation that has rightly been regarded as a bastion of honest and 
honourable broadcasting for decades.

‘There may have been individuals who 
could or should have been braver in confronting the unpleasant 
possibility of his depravity when rumours and accusations surfaced, but 
that is evidently also true of the hospitals and mental institutions 
that trusted him to the extent that he had his own set of keys for 
Broadmoor with living quarters on the site and a bedroom at Stoke 
Mandeville Hospital.

‘A picture is emerging of a man 
unusually adept at manipulation and concealment. Identifying willing 
co-conspirators and abusers is much more important than demonising the 
bamboozled who may have thought their suspicions so far off the scale of
 decent human behaviour as to be unbelievable.’

Janet Fielding also starred in the 
scene where Dr Who accidentally teleports himself and companion Tegan 
Jovanka (Fielding) in the tardis before unintentionally beaming 
‘earthling’ Gareth Jenkins (playing himself). Two evil Sontarans are 
also onboard the time machine but Gareth kills them.

Savile appears and presents Gareth with a 'Jim fixed it for me' medal and a ‘Mezon gun’ used by the Sontarans.
