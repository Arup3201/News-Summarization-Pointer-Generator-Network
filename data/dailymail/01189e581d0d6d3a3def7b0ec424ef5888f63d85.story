Amanda Knox has become engaged to a 27-year-old musician who  wrote to her while she was in an Italian prison.

The 27-year-old will reportedly marry Colin Sutherland, who Knox has known since middle school.

But as their families celebrate in Washington, a legal back and forth continues in Italy as Knox and her co-defendant and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito fight back against their 2014 re-conviction by an Italian upper court for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher.

The news of Knox's engagement was first reported in a Seattle Times column on Wednesday. 

Columnist Jonathan Martin writes that Knox confirmed the engagement to him via email buut said no more. The pair were engaged last week. 

No date has been set for the nuptials.

Before her current love was revealed in September, Knox was known to be living in Seattle with her classical guitarist then-boyfriend James Terrano.

A LinkedIn profile for Sutherland once listed his name as Thunderstrike after the Marvel comic-book character - says he studied French at Sarah Lawrence

Sutherland once lived in Brooklyn but has since moved back to Seattle, where he and Knox attended middle school.

Childhood friend: Sutherland reportedly wrote to Knox as she sat in an Italian prison following her 2009 conviction. The pair have known each other since middle school

She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing. 

She's now working at a Seattle bookstore and as a writer for the West Seattle Herald.

Meanwhile, her case is headed back into the Italian courts once again following an initial conviction, an overturning of that conviction followed by her reconviction along with Sollecito.

It seems unlikely Knox, who now lives in the U.S, will ever be returned to jail for the crime as she has repeatedly refused to return to Italy. If she is convicted again, Italy is likely to request to extradite her but her longstanding battle to prove her innocence has made her a cause célèbre in the U.S who may ignore political pressure to send her back. 

Sollecito and Knox were first found guilty of murder in November 2009.

The previous man: Knox was last known before Sutherland to be dating classical guitarist James Terrano, who she reportedly lived with in Seattle, Washington

The killers' convictions were later quashed after experts said forensic evidence had been contaminated and they were released. Prosecutors then appealed that finding and the case was re-tried in March 2013.

In January last year a court upheld the original verdict, but the pair remained at large as under Italy's legal system, any verdict reached after a second appeal but be ratified by the highest court. 

Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology. 

Back then: Knox was accused along with her then boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (both at left) of brutally murdering Knox's roommate in Perugia, Italy Meredith Kercher, 21 (right) in 2007

Kercher, 21, was found dead on the floor of her bedroom. Some of her belongings were missing and Knox reported an apparent burglary to police.

Detectives concluded the supposed break-in looked staged and Knox became the prime suspect.

She then implicated Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner she worked for. The duo were arrested along with Sollecito. Mr Lumumba was later released when evidence pointed to Rudy Guede's involvement.

Guede was then accused of committing the murder along with Sollecito and Knox. In October 2008 he was found guilty of sexually assaulting and murdering Kercher. 

Home for good: While it's highly unlikely that Knox would be extradited no matter what happens in court in March, her ex Raffaele Sollecito must face the music in his home country

Still at risk: Since the last verdict, Sollecito, 30, has stayed in Italy. He was ordered to remain there after being found near the Italian border with Slovenia and Austria hours after being found guilty for the second time. He has since completed a degree in information technology
