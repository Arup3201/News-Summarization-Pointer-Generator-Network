Young-at-heart Kathleen Connell celebrated her 100th birthday and shared the secret of her long life - playing on her handheld games console.

Instead of knitting or playing bingo, Kathleen - known to all as Kit - spends two hours a day tapping away on her Nintendo DS Lite.

Instead of knitting or playing bingo Kathleen gets stuck into one of her many Nintendo games

The grandmother-of-one, who still lives independently, said she is so addicted to the hand-held device she wore out her first console and had to replace it.

Kit turned 100 last Friday but, according to the Brain Trainer, one of her favourite games, she has a mental age of just 64 - the same age as her daughter Pam.

She said yesterday: 'It's absolutely super. I don't feel a day over 80.

'I can't speak highly enough of it. I try to keep my brain active by playing my Nintendo. I don't know what I would do without it.'

Her daughter, Pam Stewart, bought her mum the console as a 96th birthday present but Kit had to replace the console two years ago when she wore out the power switch.

The pensioner, who lives alone 
despite having had both legs amputated, spends her evenings painting 
pictures using the computer, completing puzzles and said she now knows 
5,000 words.

She has a 
stack of 10 games including Scrabble, Zenses puzzle game, My Word Coach,
Family Fortunes, Puzzler World, Art Academy and Left Brain Right Brain.

Kit, who lives in Thornliebank, East Renfrewshire, and turned 100 on Friday, said: 'I'll play it in the evening, then I'll have a break and a cup of tea, then I'll go back to playing my Nintendo.

'If there's nothing on the television I'll sit for an hour or two and try my hand on a game. I'll do some of the brain training exercises and I'm also learning to paint on it.

'I can't speak highly enough of this Nintendo. It helps to keep my brain as active as possible in my old age.

'If there's any secret to a long life it's to think positive and keep your mind active.'

Pam, from Rutherglen, said she has been stunned at how easily her mother has taken to gaming.

She added: 'I'm very proud of the way mum keeps active after all those years. I bought it for her six years ago and she has loads of games for it now. It certainly keeps her sharp.'

A Nintendo spokesman said: 'We're delighted that Mrs. Connell is such a Nintendo fan and enjoys the challenges of Brain Training on her Nintendo DS.

'This game has had huge success thanks to its' ability to stimulate the brain and challenge memory skills simply by using it for just a few minutes each day.

'It is wonderful that she also hones her creative skills on Art Academy. Our products are designed to be enjoyed by all ages and generations and Mrs Connell is true testament to this.'
