MailOnline cemented its place as the world's biggest newspaper website last night after scooping another gong at the 2012 Press Awards – the Oscars of British journalism.

The Daily Mail's online operation triumphed for the third year in a row in the digital category at the annual event hosted by the Society of Editors.

The win caps another record-breaking year for the site, which registered more than 114million monthly unique browsers in December and continued its phenomenal rise into 2013 when it enjoyed its highest-ever figures of 126,753,431 in January.

MailOnline won the judges over with its 
dynamic coverage of three vastly different stories - Hurricane Sandy 
which struck the United States in October, the tragic death of the 
hoaxed nurse at the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital in December and the 
Olympics Closing Ceremony in August.

Tragic: The judges were also impressed by the coverage of the death of Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse at the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital who took her life after taking a prank call from two Australian DJs

Diverse themes: Judges said the site was 'brilliantly edited with compelling pictures' such as the ones shown here during the Olympics Closing Ceremony

Judges praised the site for its 'willingness to tear up the formula when the story demanded it, with great use of images and video'.

They said: 'The large amount of original content makes it essential reading in the newsrooms of not just competitors, but on an international scale.'

When shortlisted, the judges had described MailOnline as an 'online 
powerhouse', saying it was a 'must-read site, brilliantly edited with an
unparalleled sidebar, its brilliant, compelling news and pictures 
showcase some of the world's most fascinating tales'.

They said it has the 'most extensive showbusiness coverage around'.

After accepting The Digital Award at The Lancaster Hotel in London last night, MailOnline Publisher Martin Clarke said: 'The success of the MailOnline, in establishing itself as the biggest newspaper website in the world, has been achieved thanks to the hard work and dedication of the website's staff and I'm delighted that their talent has been recognised by our peers with this award.'

It was also a night of success for the 
Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers, which picked up five awards 
between them.

Humorous columnist Craig 
Brown added to his ever-growing trophy cabinet after taking home two 
awards - Critic of the Year for the Mail on Sunday and the Best of 
Humour Award for his writing in the Daily Mail.

It follows his success at the 2011 awards when he became the first journalist to scoop three personal honours in a year.
