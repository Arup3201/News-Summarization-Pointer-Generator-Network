Brendan Rodgers has brushed off scrutiny on his position by insisting he is the best man to lead Liverpool forward.

Rodgers has come under fire since his side were dumped out of the Champions League, with former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol claiming he 'would be sacked' if results don't improve.

It has been possibly the hardest week of an increasingly difficult season and Rodgers has been in contact with the club's owners, Fenway Sports Group, following the 1-1 draw with Basle.

Despite pressure on his position, Rodgers says he is the best man to lead Liverpool going forward

He admitted FSG are disappointed with how the campaign has gone but Rodgers has faith he can spark a revival, starting on Sunday at Old Trafford against Manchester United.

Rodgers said: 'I think the message for me is clear, I don't think there would be anyone better to do the job here. Seven months ago we nearly won the title unexpectedly, I had time to work with players and above expectation and took them beyond where the club has been.

'This has been a difficult start with new players, less coaching time, young players, virtually starting again. I don't think there is anybody equipped better to deal with that .

'I have been here for the last two and a half years and experienced what this club is about and seeing what we get from the players whenever we are at our best.

'It comes with the territory [criticism and people calling for a new manager] when you don't win games, football is very short term. The same people maybe six or seven months ago, I couldn't do anything wrong. Listen, command is lonely

'That is the way football works. You have to accept that as a manager and fight even harder to bring success and something that in this period has ensured I will do for sure.'

Rodgers says the influx of new players, including Mario Balotelli (back centre) and Alberto Moreno (right), has been like 'starting over again' after Liverpool narrowly missed out on last season's Premier League title

Mario Balotelli, meanwhile, has accepted an FA charge over posting an alleged anti-Semitic image on social media. Balotelli had until 6pm on Monday to respond to the FA after they found he had breached social media rules.

Balotelli has not requested a personal hearing but has submitted written mitigation. There is no time scale on when the case will be concluded.

The Italy striker has not played for Liverpool since November 8 but could be involved in the squad at Old Trafford  after recovering from a groin problem
