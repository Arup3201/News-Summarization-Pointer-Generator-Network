Jose Mourinho lauded 'historic' John Terry after the Chelsea captain became only the sixth Englishman to play 100 Champions League matches.

The Blues beat Sporting Lisbon 1-0 in Portugal thanks to Nemanja Matic's first-half header as Terry marked his milestone in typical fashion by helping keep a clean sheet.

Mourinho said: 'The club of 100 is a limited group. Only very few people can play 100 games in the CL for the same club.

'He may not have been captain in all those games, but surely in most of them. He's an historic player and will go down in the history of the club.'

On reaching his century, Terry told Sky Sports 5: 'I'm very proud, there's not too many players to achieve that.'

The Chelsea captain was glad missed chances by Diego Costa and Andre Schurrle did not come back to haunt his side, adding: 'They're a good side but it's been about 10 years since they've been in the Champions League so it was a big night for them.

'We had so many chances, it was one of those nights where it just didn't go but thankfully Mati came up with a good header.

'We lost our first game last year and came back to win so that was in our mind, that we had to win.'
