John Lowe, 82, told officers that his ex-partner and her daughter 'had to be put down', a court has heard

An elderly dog farmer accused of murdering his ex-partner and her daughter told police he would 'rather have put them down than the dogs', a court has heard.  

John Lowe allegedly told officers he 'was not sorry' and that his alleged victims 'had to be put down' after being arrested at the scene of the double shooting in Tilford near Farnham, Surrey.

The 82-year-old is accused of murdering Christine Lee, 66, and her 40-year-old daughter Lucy Lee 'amid a scene of carnage' at his run-down farm on February 23 this year.

The pensioner - who was arrested at the scene after a stand-off with armed police - allegedly made several comments about the shootings as he was taken into custody in the back of a police van. 

In evidence at Guildford Crown Court today, PC Philip Potter told the court that Lowe stated: 'I'll tell you now, I'd rather have put them down than put down the f****** dogs.'

Lowe later signed all his comments - which were noted by officers at the time and read back to him - as true, the court was told. 

The jury was also shown a video of Lowe in the holding area at Guildford Police Station after his arrest. 

The footage shows him making comments to officers about the 'torment' he claimed he suffered at the hands of the Lees.

He is also seen expressing concern for his dogs, including his four pet Chihuahuas, one of which he said he had cost £7,500.

Talking about the mother and daughter, he later said: 'They have been giving me such a terrible f****** time. The daughter was worse than the mother.

'I know it's terrible thing to say, but it's a terrible relief that all that harassment has gone off my shoulders. F****** hell, terrible, morning, noon and night.'  

PC Richard McEwan told jurors that Lowe had said: 'They had to be put down, there was nothing else I could do. I've had terrible problems with Christine, they wouldn't let me eat.' 

He later added: 'I'm not sorry, I'm out of the problem, they are causing me problems every day', the court was told.

During the video shown in court, Lowe was seen asking officers to call the area manager of the RSPCA, whom he apparently knew well. 

Christine Lee, 66, had been living with Lowe and providing him with care and assistance after he fell on hard times, Guildford Crown Court was told 

Mr Lowe is also accused of murdering Mrs Lee's daughter Lucy, 40, who made a frantic 999 calls moments before her death 

An image of the gun allegedly used to murder Christine and Lucy Lee was today shown to the jury 

He said: 'Tell him I've put four dogs down at Keeper's Cottage, a cane corsa, which is an Italian mastiff, and three alsatians.

'They were four dogs I didn't want to leave for anybody else to look after as they were pushy. Somebody would have gotten bit.'  

Later on, he claimed to officers that Christine's shooting was an accident, the court was told.

He allegedly said: 'That shooting, the older one, was a complete accident. It happened as they were pushing me out the conservatory and a gun went off by accident.

'A lot of things will go in my favour, about how they acted, but you can't get past the fact I shot them so that's that.'

PC Potter told how Lowe had commented that he 'should've thought more seriously' about his actions.

He allegedly said: 'If that cow hadn't gone all f*****g mental at me, I wouldn't gave gone and pulled the trigger. I didn't mean to pull it.'

Later that evening, Lowe said he had 'made a mistake today and I'm very sorry about that', the court was told.  

Christine Lee's daughter Stacey Banner left the court in tears as the alleged comments were recounted 

The court also heard how Lowe told an officer at the scene the pair, who were supposed to be caring for him at his home, had starved him and spent his money. 

He was also heard referring to 'the two I shot' while travelling in the van to Guildford police station, jurors were told.   

Christine's daughter, Stacy Banner, ran screaming from the court in tears as officers recounted the comments allegedly made about her mother. 

The trial has heard that Ms Banner spent a period in 2013 living in a caravan with her partner in the grounds of Lowe's farm.

Detective Constable David Jones told the court that the defendant had also made comments about Ms Banner, saying: 'I didn't want to get in s*** over her but she had two young kids otherwise I would have sorted her out.' 

After his arrest, Lowe showed no remorse or regret for the shootings, which he said were accidental, according to prosecutor Mark Dennis QC.  

Describing the killing of Lucy, Mr Dennis said: 'The defendant in effect ended her life in the same heartless way as he used to dispose of the lives of the four dogs.' 

In court, the jury was shown a shotgun which was recovered from the house by scenes of crime officers.

It had two spent cartridges inside, which jurors heard had been used in the shootings.

Mr Dennis also showed the court two notes allegedly left by Lowe at the scene.

One of the notes appeared to leave Keeper's Cottage - the name of the farmhouse - 'lock stock and barrel' to an unnamed person.

A second note transferred ownership of a horse named Lucky and its foals to a friend, Lesley.

The court heard the note, which was signed by Lowe, said: 'I'm sorry about what has happened here but I've been having a really bad time with Christine.'

The jury had previously heard that Lucy had made a 'desperate' 999 call to police moments before she died aying that Lowe had killed her mother and she was 'running for her life'.

She then told the operator that she was going back to confront the pensioner. She was then shot twice, the court heard. 

Christine was found dead in the lounge of Lowe's home, while Lucy's body was discovered lying on steps outside the property.  

Lowe, who had a valid shotgun licence at the time, had used the same weapon to kill the pair and the four dogs.  

A post-mortem examination confirmed Christine was killed by a single gunshot fired into her chest from about 1ft away 

The court heard officers found a 'scene of carnage' at the rural site, with four dogs also shot dead

Mr Dennis said evidence suggested that he shot Christine as she was in a 'cowering position' as he stood over her.

Lucy was shot in the back of her head from around 9ft away. Lowe then had to reload before firing a second fatal shot into her chest.  

The court heard that the former gamekeeper had a love-hate relationship with the pair.

Mr Dennis said that Christine had known Lowe for many years and had occasionally been in a relationship with him.

She had moved into his house to care for him after he fell on hard times. Lowe's long-term partner Susanna Wilson had died in 2013 and he had lost his licence to breed dogs at the farm.  

But Mr Dennis said that the defendant had complained about the mother and daughter interfering in his affairs.

A few weeks before the killings, Lowe told a mechanic who visited the property to repair a vehicle: 'Those two between them drive me ******* mad, they want to know about the ins and out of everything.'

PC Chris Gleeson, who arrested Lowe, said: 'He said she [Christine] was an ex-girlfriend and added, "She's been supposed to be looking after me but she's been starving me to death and she's been keeping me short of money. I just sold my Toyota Landcruiser for £5,500 and they've spent the lot."'

Lowe denies two charges of murder and a third of possessing a firearm with intent of endangering life.   

The trial before High Court judge Mr Justice Singh, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.
