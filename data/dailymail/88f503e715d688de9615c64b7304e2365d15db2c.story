Six-time Paralympic champion David Weir has pulled out of this week's IPC Athletics European Championships.

Weir was due to compete in four races in Swansea against his great Swiss rival Marcel Hug but has been forced to withdraw with tendonitis in his arm.

The 35-year-old won four Paralympic gold medals at London 2012 in T54 events at 800 metres, 1500m, 5000m and the marathon following two golds at Beijing four years earlier.

Main rival: Weir was scheduled to race alongside Marcel Hug of Switzerland in four separate events

Weir took a break from competition last year and missed the World Championships in Lyon but won Commonwealth Games gold in the Para-sport T54 over 1500 metres in Glasgow last month.

Nearly 40 countries and over 550 athletes will be competing in the Swansea event from August 19-23, many of the British team fresh from taking part at the Commonwealth Games.

And English discus thrower Dan Greaves insists there will be no let up after his Glasgow gold.

Greaves hit the headlines when he won England's first track and field gold at the Commonwealth Games in the men's Para-sport F42/44 discus competition at Hampden Park.

The Leicestershire athlete's throw of 59.21m pushed Welshman Aled Davies into second place and now he is aiming for European gold at championships which start in Swansea on Tuesday.

'The fact that the Commonwealth Games were only a few weeks ago means I'm still in great shape,' said Greaves.

'It's not as if the Europeans have come later in the year and you have to double peak.

'It was fantastic to compete at a multi-sport Championship and to win the first gold medal for England was a great feeling.'

Greaves, 31, won Paralympic discus gold at Athens in 2004 and also picked up silvers in 2000 and 2012 and a bronze in Beijing in 2008.

But Greaves admitted: 'Glasgow was one of my most special medals.

'The Paralympics is the top of tree for us athletes but it was fantastic to compete in the Commonwealth Games, especially as it was held in Britain.

'I've got a picture of the medal of my phone and when I see it between training sessions it gives me a constant reminder of the motivation I need to succeed.'
