Staff members, as well as a grandmother who was at the hotel for a swim, jumped into the water and hauled the girl to the poolside where they tried to resuscitate her.

She was taken by ambulance to Blackpool Victoria Hospital and then transferred to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, where she later died.

Last night a 40-year-old woman from Galashiels, believed to be the child's mother, was arrested on suspicion of murder by Lancashire Police.

Detective Inspector Nick Connaughton said that investigations were still at an early stage.

He added: ‘This is a terribly tragic situation where a young girl has lost her fight for life after an incident in a hotel swimming pool.

‘We are now treating this sad case as murder and need to know just how the child has come into difficulties in the pool.’  

Police launched the probe after paramedics failed in their efforts to revive the child at the poolside as shocked guests looked on.

The pool is situated on the ground floor and has its own bar. The hotel is family owned and no one from the establishment wished to comment last night.

Health and safety officials will also carry out an investigation into the incident.

Last night, police confirmed that they believe the child who died had been left in the pool, which has no separate children’s section, by an adult.

One witness said: ‘If this is not death by neglect I don’t know what is. Kiddies should not be left in a pool like this - there are so many risk factors.’

Witness Carole Greenwood, who has been lifeguarding and doing first aid for the past 36 years, told how she tried to rescue the little girl.

She said: 'I was in the changing rooms and a lady came in and said "There's an incident in the pool, is there a life guard?"

'The child was on the bottom of the pool, so I dived in and got her out. I wasn't really aware of what had happened when I got there, my concern was with the little girl and rescuing her and resuscitating her as best I could.

'She was on the bottom, she was unresponsive and I pulled her out as per my training and then I resuscitated her on the side.

'I did manage to resuscitate her and she was breathing when the ambulance arrived. Obviously I'm devastated for the poor little girl, it's very sad.

'At the time you are quite shocked because all your training is coming into action something you think you will never ever do but I'm satisfied I helped out in this case.'

She added that no lifeguards had been on duty in the pool, because it is not the policy in a private pool.

She said: 'Basically children in swimming pools should be looked after by their own parents.

'It's not necessary to have lifeguards necessarily because life guards are there to prevent accidents and parents have got to be aware that children can't swim, they are not strong swimmers and they need to wear floatation aids especially little children and older children need to be monitored as well.'

Simon Barr, on holiday with his wife, Linzi, 42, and children, Sammy, aged three and Jacob, seven months, said: 'I think it’s totally tragic for somebody to come on holiday, we have a three-year-old child as well, to come away on holiday and all of a sudden this to happen.'

He added: 'We heard a girl had been taken away by ambulance then from that moment lots of police arrived. It was only later on we heard on the news the girl had died. The hotel didn’t want to divulge anything.

'The pool was closed, it was a crime scene yesterday but re-opened today. The atmosphere is pretty subdued really. The only conversation going on is what’s happened.'

Another guest said: 'It’s shocking, especially when it’s a child’s death, it’s just so sad. I don’t know what happened but it was caught on CCTV one member of staff said.'

A guest, who did not want to give his name, said he saw the arrested woman being taken away by police, 'in shock'.

He said the night before she had been with two young girls enjoying dinner at the hotel with the other guests.

He added: 'They just seemed like a normal family on holiday. I was in the room yesterday and I saw the ambulance outside and saw them come out with what looked like a defibrillator.

'Because my wife is six months pregnant I thought...then my wife came up to the room and said a little girl has been pulled from the pool. My daughter saw the little girl being carried out to the ambulance.

'I saw the woman arrested going with the police. She wasn’t cuffed. She looked just in shock. The pool was closed. Police arrived and started taking statements from anyone who was there.'
