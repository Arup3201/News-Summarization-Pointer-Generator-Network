Diners making their way towards the famous McDonald's golden arches in Australia might be surprised when they stumble upon a Macca's.

The fast-food giant is hoping to win over locals by rebranding a number of stores in the country with its widely-used Aussie nickname.

The move is part of a campaign to mark Australia Day, the country's official national holiday, which falls on January 26.

Rebrand: Fast-food giant McDonald's is changing the name of 13 branches in Australia to Macca's, a nickname widely used by Australians

The new name will adorn 13 branches in the country, including restaurants in the southern Sydney suburb of Engadine and an outlet in Queensland's Kangaroo Point.

But the move, described as a first for the international company, is only a temporary measure, with signage to return to normal at the beginning of February.

'We're incredibly proud to embrace our 
â€˜Australian-only' nickname,' said Mark Lollback, the company's chief 
marketing officer in Australia.

'What better way to show Aussies how proud we are to be a part of the 
Australian community than change our store signs to the name the 
community has given us?'

Temporary: The company is carrying out the changes to mark Australia Day but stores will revert to their original branding at the beginning of February

The company was persuaded to carry out the name change after market research revealed that at least 50 per cent of Australians use the nickname.

A national survey placed the term as the second most recognised 'Australianism', behind 'footy' for Australian
Rules football.

The popularity of the nickname has also prompted McDonald's to call on 
Macquarie Dictionary, the authority on the English language in 
Australia, to include 'Macca's' in their online edition.
