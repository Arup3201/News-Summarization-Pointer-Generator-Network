Jack Wilshere is not a holding midfielder or a No 10, according to legendary Arsenal midfielder Liam Brady.

Instead, Brady wants to see the England star shuttling between the two positions as a traditional midfield player.

Wilshere starred in a holding role for England in European Championship qualifying wins over San Marino and Estonia.

Wilshere has shone for his country in recent games playing as a defensive playmaking midfielder

Arsenal career: 1971-1980 

Position: Attacking midfielder 

Appearances: 307 (295 starts, 12 as a sub)

Goals: 59  

Arsenal academy director: 1996 - 2014  

But Brady, who continued his association with the Gunners into an academy director role until May this year, wants to see more of Wilshere around the penalty area.

'I don't like Jack playing in the holding role,' Brady told talkSPORT. 'He's a much more valuable player when he's up around the box.

'I don't like him as a number ten, he's a midfield player you want to encourage to get forward where he can beat players with his dribbling.'

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes holds a different view to Brady. 

Speaking in his column for the Independent, Scholes hailed Wilshere as the best performing England player at present and believes the Gunner is flourishing in his deep-lying role for Roy Hodgson's men.

'I thought Jack Wilshere had two very good games for England during the last week,' Scholes said. 

'I would go one step further than that and say that, at the moment, Wilshere is England’s best player.

'The penny has dropped and he has added another dimension to his game. He has always been capable of that intricate passing game. Now he can play the ball long, too.

'The quality of some of those passes into Wayne Rooney in Estonia was very high.

Arsenal stalwart Brady spent almost two decades as the north London club's academy director 

Wilshere has shaken off his injury problems to star for club, above, and country this season
