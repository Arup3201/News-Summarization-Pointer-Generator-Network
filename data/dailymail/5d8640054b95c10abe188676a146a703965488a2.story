After years of cutting back in the wake of the worst recession in living memory, it seems we have started spoiling ourselves again.

This year saw families splash out more on eating in restaurants and going on holiday, according to analysis of our spending habits.

The improving economy has helped bolster confidence and encouraged Britons to ‘shake off the shackles of the downturn’, according to Barclaycard which carried out the research.

After years of cutting back in the wake of the worst recession in living memory, it seems Britons have started spoiling ourselves again, spending more on eating in restaurants and going on holiday

Spending on travel rose 4 per cent, on airlines 3.2 per cent and hotels, 6.4 per cent; those who stayed at home prompted an 8 per cent rise in DIY spending

Spending on eating out jumped the most in 2014, while people spent significantly less on petrol

However, we haven’t entirely forgotten the dark days of the financial crisis, which started seven years ago. Households have become more financially savvy by cutting back on the weekly shop to pay for more leisure activities, the analysis found.

This year spending on restaurants grew 14.6 per cent, while our bills for entertainment – including drinking in pubs and going to the cinema and concerts – jumped 11.3 per cent.

Consumers snapped up more gadgets, parting with 6.4 per cent more in electronics stores. Spending on travel rose 4 per cent, on airlines 3.2 per cent and hotels, 6.4 per cent. Those who stayed at home prompted an 8 per cent rise in DIY spending.

Families are balancing the books by cutting back on essentials, according to Barclaycard, which said the desire to seek out a bargain has become more ‘entrenched’ since the crisis.

Spending on food and drink grew just 2.1 per cent – less than any other category – and consumers forked out 1.8 per cent more in supermarkets, which the analysis attributed to shoppers ‘squeezing the best value from essential purchases’.

It suggests thrifty consumers are also making the most of a supermarket price war, in which the big names have slashed their prices to compete with discounters Aldi and Lidl.

Shoppers are also ditching the big weekly supermarket shop. Consumers spent 6.5 per cent less every time they went to the supermarket but made 8.9 per cent more purchases. And this trend applies to shopping generally, as households adopt a little and often approach.

The average amount spent per transaction has fallen by 3.7 per cent this year, but the number of purchases increased 7.4 per cent.

The plummeting price of petrol, driven by the slump in the cost of oil, is helping keep more cash in consumers’ pockets. Prices have dropped from 130.79p a litre to 114.07p, according to the AA, while the Barclaycard figures show spending on petrol has dropped 5.5 per cent this year.

Valerie Soranno Keating, chief executive of Barclaycard, hailed a ‘steady recovery in consumer spending’.

‘Greater confidence in the future, stemming from an improving economic backdrop, continued falls in unemployment, lower inflation and discounting by retailers have all tempted consumers to part with more of their money,’ she said.

‘Despite increased confidence, the value-seeking behaviour that we saw take hold in the tough economic times has become entrenched and we’ve seen consumers responsibly balancing the books by cutting back in one area to spend in another.

‘I suspect it’s a behaviour we’ll continue to see until meaningful wage growth.’

There are signs that this is starting to happen. Figures released last week show regular pay grew 1.6 per cent in the year to October, while inflation fell to 1 per cent – its lowest level for 12 years.
