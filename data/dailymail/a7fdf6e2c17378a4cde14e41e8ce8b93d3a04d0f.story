A 22-year-old seasoned skier has revealed the terrifying moment that he came close to death after being buried up to his neck in an avalanche during an off-piste trip.

Edwin Lamair was skiing with his brother Davis and a friend last Sunday about 4.30pm on top of 
Vail Mountain, Colorado when he was hit with a wall of snow.

Mr Lamair told the Today show on Monday: 'I saw debris falling and I started to fall. I inhaled some snow, I was choking and wasn't able to breathe. Luckily they could search for me.'

His brother Davis was about 100 yards up the mountain when he saw the avalanche swallow his brother.

He said: 'I could see him sliding down to my right. I started to see debris flow down.'

Luckily Davis, who had a camera mounted to his helmet, was able to find Edwin in the fading light of day and quickly started digging him out using his hands.

By the time that Davis reached Edwin, he was buried up to his neck in snow as he struggled to keep his head up for air.

It took four hours of digging to free the survivor. Once at the bottom, LaMair was checked out and discovered he had torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his knee.

Edwin Lamair escaped the terrifying situation with a knee injury which will require surgery and keep him off the slopes until next season.

Edwin said that he would be forever thankful to his brother for saving his life. He said: 'I'll have his back, I'll always be looking out for him.'

His brother Davis added that the terrifying situation had made him reflect on their pastime of back country skiing.

He added: 'We never really thought that run would slide, we skied it earlier in the day. We will definitely be a lot more cautious.' 

What started out as a regular ski quickly turned into a near-death situation for two brothers in Colorado

According
 to experts, the brothers' story should serve as a warning to other skiers, 
especially ones that like the adventure out of bounds.

Ethan
 Greene, director of the Colorado Avalanche Information, said skiiers 
should always check avalanche forecasts before setting out.

'Just
 like if you're going into the mountains in the summer time when you 
check the weather forecasts ... you want to check the avalanche 
forecasts to see what conditions you're facing that day,' he said.
