Muslims, Jews and Christians will worship under one roof as an architect sets out to make religious history.

The so-called House Of One will be a multipurpose synagogue, church and mosque set in the heart of Berlin.

Incredibly, the move has been met with unerring support from rabbis, imams and priests.

Carefully designed: Each chamber will cater to the faith's specific requirements, with a foot bath and two levels in the mosque, an organ in the church, and two levels in the synagogue

The £35m building, being paid for by donations, is set to be completed in 2018.

Last week, three religious leaders met to give their blessing to the project - and the first brick was ceremonially presented.

It was the culmination of five years of work, after archaeologists unearthed the city's first ever church - Petrikirche - which dates back to 1350.

'We decided we needed to use the space to develop a sign of peace and tolerance, rather than another old empty church,' House Of One spokesman Anna Poeschel told MailOnline.

'Petrikirche was the start of Berlin, which has now grown into a multicultural, multi-faith city. A lot has happened over the centuries, this is a sign of peace and tolerance.'

Groundbreaking: German architect Wilfried Kuehn holds a model of his design for the House Of One, a multi-faith prayer building to be set in the heart of Berlin that combines a synagogue, church and mosque

The building, designed by architect Wilfried Kuehn in a competition created for the project, will provide one of the only inner-city places of worship for Berlin's Muslims, with most mosques located on the outskirts.

Despite some voices of criticism, Ms Poeschel said the overwhelming reaction from all faiths has been welcoming.

'We have not always had as many Muslims in Berlin as in London. And this is the place where the Second World War started, with the persecution of Jews. This is a perfect symbol of peace.

'You hear so much these days of religions coming together in violence and terrorism so this is a different message.'

Each of the three areas in the House will be the same size, but of a different shape, Mr Kuehn points out.

There will be a central meeting place, with doors leading off into spaces for each faith.

In the mosque and synagogue there will be two levels to cater for the traditional gender divide. There will also be space to wash feet in the mosque.

The church will have just one floor, and will house an organ.

With different days of worship, congestion will be manageable.

Muslims attend mosque on Fridays, while Jews congregate on Saturdays and Christians pray on Sundays.

While each have different architectural requirements, architect Wilfried Kuehn insists they are not as different as many think.

For example, it has not always been customary for mosques to have a minaret - spire.

And according to ancient Christian designs, churches do not need a tower.
