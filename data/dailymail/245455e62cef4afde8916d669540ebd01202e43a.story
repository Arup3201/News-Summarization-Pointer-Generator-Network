Nineteen-year-old Giulia Arena was crowned Miss Italia 2013 in a glittering ceremony – but it was not aired by Italy’s state broadcaster, which dropped it from its schedules for the first time in 25 years.

Anna Maria Tarantola, president of the state TV station, RAI, deems the contest – which launched the careers of screen sirens Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida - a sexist anachronism.

The final of Miss Italia, which took place at the end of last month, was shown instead by private television network La7, with 900,000 people tuning in.

Tarantola, 68, believes it’s an event that reinforces a two-dimensional view of women.

She told The Guardian: ‘Perhaps here, even if things are changing, which they are, the prevailing image of women [on television] is as housewives, mothers … or as showgirls, that kind of thing.’

She added: ‘A woman must make a name for herself because of her talent, her ability. She must have the opportunity to express her capabilities… Public TV should not, in my opinion, be sending out the message, 'look… you can become someone if you're beautiful'.

‘No, you can become someone if you are committed, know how to value [your] own talent, know how to highlight it, and cultivate it. And then, if you're beautiful, all the better.’

House Speaker Laura Boldrini, of the Left Ecology Freedom party welcomed RAI’s decision saying: ‘This is a civilised and modern choice.

‘We should be delighted that Italian women can now have a chance to make themselves appreciated and valued without parading wearing a number. Only two per cent of women on TV express and opinion and speak. The rest are silent and more often than not semi-dressed.’

But Patrizia Mirigliani, organiser of the show, hit back, saying: ’Maybe the honourable Boldrini does not know that across the country hundreds of local councils are hosting similar events with thousands of young women happily taking part in - neither naked or silently - to acquire that visibility that no other event allows them to in a clean and serious way.

‘These sort of beauty contests have been taking place in the civilised world for years and is not only an appreciation of a woman’s beauty but also gives her the opportunity to express her thoughts and ideas. It does not degrade women and I would love the opportunity to explain that to the honourable Boldrini.

‘I have been in talks with RAI for several years to try and update the format and bring it more into modern times and we are still in talks at the moment.’

Following the decision to drop the show the Vatican’s official newspaper L’Osservatore Romano said: ’Rather than criticising Miss Italia, it is better to let it fall into the oblivion that it deserves and instead condemn other forms of female manipulation such as the increasing willingness to turn to cosmetic surgery to perfect themselves.’

It also hit out at the Italian TV staple diet of scantily clad women, saying: ’We have enough young ladies in bikinis, we see them on all channels at all hours. Miss Italia has become an old wreck but it was not always like that - after the War it was an opportunity for women to display their natural beauty, humble origins and dressed without the aim of starting a showbusiness career.

Political opponents were quick to jump on the bandwagon with Luca D’Alessandro, of Berlusconi’s People of Freedom Party, saying: ’It’s really rather interesting to note that the Speaker of the Lower House has closed the door to Miss Italia but thrown it open to Gay Pride. I am not opposed to any show or rally and in fact the more colourful the better but her decision has the air of racism.’

Gian Marco Centinaio, of the Northern League, said: ’Women have a right to show their beauty. There is nothing scandalous in silent women dressed in bikinis. What would she prefer? Miss Burqa?’ Does she now know that Muslim women are also not allowed to speak to men unless to members of their own family?’

Respected Italian daily Corriere Della Sera said in an editorial: ’If banning Miss Italia from TV makes us feel more modern and civilised as a country then we really are in a bad way.’

The Miss Italia pageant has been blighted in controversy several times with another row in 2007 when judges asked to be allowed to consider the ‘size and shape of a contestant’s bottom’ as part of the selection criteria.

Last year the rules of the swimwear section were also changed with competitors asked to wear more sober one-piece outfits in either black or white instead of thigh revealing bikinis.
