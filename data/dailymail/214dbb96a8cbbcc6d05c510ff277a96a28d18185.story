India looks set to trigger demands for an instant end to British aid handouts after it revealed plans for a £50million mission to Mars.

Prime minister Manmohan Singh made the space journey announcement in  a speech marking the 65th anniversary  of his country’s independence from British rule.

British taxpayers are committed to an eight-year, £1.6billion package of aid to India which is due to run until 2015.

However, there is growing pressure to 
end it earlier because of austerity measures in place here. Mr Singh’s 
announcement will only fuel the calls.

He said the unmanned spacecraft would enter orbit around the planet and collect scientific information.

It is likely to be launched in November 2013 with a rocket developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation.

‘This spaceship to Mars will be a huge step for us in the area of science and technology,’ Mr Singh said.

Scientists say the spacecraft is expected to take nearly 11 months to get close  to Mars.

Last week, Nasa’s new robot rover 
named Curiosity landed in a huge crater on Mars and has begun a host of 
scientific studies of the planet.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh heralded the plan as 'a huge step for us in the area of science and technology'

India is ramping up its ambitious space programme with confirmation of plans to send a probe to Mars

The Coalition earlier this year said 
it would finally end aid payments to India, but not until the end of the
 current programme in three years.

The average annual spend on India is 
about £280million a year, even though the now-booming Asian giant has 
had its own space programme for years.

Despite the British cash, India 
rejected a British-built Typhoon fighter jet as preferred candidate for a
 £13billion defence deal and chose a French option instead.

India’s former finance minister, 
Pranab Mukherjee, has said he did not even want Britain’s aid and that 
it was just ‘peanuts’ in the booming country’s development expenditure.

Unlike other Whitehall departments, 
the Department for International Development’s budget is rising by 35 
per cent in real terms by 2015.

And a Bill is to be introduced in this
 Parliament to enshrine in law the commitment that 0.7 per cent of 
Britain’s national income will be spent on aid.

However, polls have shown that 71 per 
cent of Britons disagree with the plan, and that two-thirds of the 
country believe Britain spends too much on international development.

International Development Secretary 
Andrew Mitchell, accepting earlier this year that the aid to India 
should end, said the Indian economy was booming and its own efforts to 
end poverty were proving more effective.

‘I completely understand why people question the aid programme to India and we questioned it ourselves,’ he said.

India has had an active space programme since the 1960s.

Since the mid-1970s, it has launched 
scores of satellites for itself and for  nearly two dozen other 
countries. India sent a spacecraft into orbit around the moon in 2008.

In all, there have been about 40 
missions to Mars with just about half of them being successful – with 
attempts made by the USA, Russia, France, Europe and China.

Critics of Singh’s Congress party say 
instead of the Mars mission, the government should concentrate on 
providing the basic needs of people such as electricity and safe 
drinking water.

Two weeks ago, the electricity grids  
that serve more than 600million Indians collapsed for hours in the 
world’s  largest blackout.

The cost of the mission has been estimated at $70-90million
