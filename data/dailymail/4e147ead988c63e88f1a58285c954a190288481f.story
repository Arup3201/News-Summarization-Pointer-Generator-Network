One of America's top spies has revealed key details of the shadowy world he lived in for 24 years - including how he used his own wife in a mission.

Hank Crumpton, who served as deputy director of the CIA's Counter-Terrorism Center and led the U.S. response to 9/11, told 60 Minutes he owes his wife 'everything'.

Asked about an operation involving the mother of his three children, Crumpton told CBS: 'This one operation that you refer to we had a communications device embedded in a cooler.

'We were transporting it across a 
border to deliver to an agent so he could 
install it and so we could have regular communications with him.

'My spouse was an integral part of that effort as she was with many more.'

Asked whether his wife had training 
as a spy, he said: 'No training but just through the course of necessity
while raising three children.'

Crumpton, who also led the team hunting Osama bin Laden, described the wife he met in
Africa as a 'terrific partner in marriage and in espionage'. 'I owe her
everything,' he added.

The former officer ran
one of the spy agency's secret domestic networks conducted 
counter-intelligence within the U.S. as the chief of the CIA's National 
Resources Division.

Crumpton also led the U.S. response 
to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and talked about the months in 
Afghanistan after America declared war on the country and the CIA led 
the mission to topple the Taliban.

Ex-CIA: Hank Crumpton spoke to CBS's Lara Logan regarding his pessimism about how many foreign spies there are in the U.S.

In his book, The Art of Intelligence, he tells how he learned about insurgency first-hand from African rebels.

He learned about blood feuds from Afghan tribal leaders and he learned that al Qaeda terrorists and enemy agents from North Korea all have a weakness for porn.

Crumpton said: 'I never met a North Korean that did not like pornography.'

Telling interviewer Lara Logan what he would have to do in his line of work, Crumpton said: 'Supplying porn to a North Korean official to entice them to spy for America, along with money or whatever else it might take. Well, for me the answer was yes, I was willing to do that.'

Crumpton also told how he led a special unit tasked with finding bin Laden five years before 9/11 and, in late summer 1999, had the former al Qaida leader  in his sights - but was refused permission to kill him.

He said: 'From 98, '99 all the way up to 2001, the warnings were there. We had extensive human networks in Afghanistan, Afghan sources that had been reporting on al Qaeda, on the presence of bin Laden.'

'I would hazard to guess there are more 
foreign intelligence officers inside the U.S. working against U.S. 
interests now than even at the height of the Cold War. It's a critical 
issue.'

But Crumpton said President Clinton's White House didn't trust the CIA's Afghan sources alone and they wanted U.S. eyes on the target.

'So we were driven to look at various technical options. And we looked at a range of things. Long-range optics, they were too heavy, too cumbersome to get over the mountains.

'We looked at balloons. The prevailing winds would take those balloons to China. That would be a bad thing. We scrapped that. And then we stumbled across the UAVs, particularly the Predator.

'And sure enough, wasn't long before we had the Predator in theater over Afghanistan, the Predator unarmed at the time. And our human sources took us to a village-- far-- not far from Kandahar.

'We saw a security detail, a convoy and we saw bin Laden exit the vehicle. Clearly. And we had-- the optics were spot on. It was beaming back to us, CIA headquarters.

'We immediately alerted the White House. And the Clinton administration's response was, "Well, it will take several hours for the TLAMs, the cruise missiles launched from submarines, to reach that objective. So you need to tell us where bin Laden will be five or six hours from now." The frustration was enormous.'

Crumpton said he wanted to kill the terrorist there and then, but was denied permission.

Speaking about the amount of foreign spies on U.S. soil, he told CBS: 'If you look at the threat that is imposed upon our nation every day, some of the major nation states - China in particular - have very sophisticated intelligence operations, very aggressive operations against the U.S.

'I would hazard to guess there are more foreign intelligence officers inside the U.S. working against U.S. interests now than even at the height of the Cold War. It's a critical issue.'

He also expressed his concerns about what al Qaeda are doing in North Africa and the danger they pose.

'I'm
particularly concerned about al Qaeda in Yemen, which is fractured as a
nation state. The Sahel, if you look at al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb, 
they pose a threat, and in Somalia. Those are the places I'd be 
concerned,' he said.

He
also believes the U.S. government should not withdraw the troops too 
quickly as he fears al Qaeda could make a comeback in Afghanistan.

He said: 'You've got so many mistakes on the U.S. side, and you've got a feckless, corrupt government on the Afghan side.

'I am really more pessimistic now than I've been in a long time.'
