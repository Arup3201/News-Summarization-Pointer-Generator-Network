A Darwin man discovered a huge sinkhole which had opened up just metres from his home late last week after he heard the sound of the earth collapsing in on itself.

Darwin River resident Lance Hart told Nine News he was alerted to the hole when he heard a 'rumbling kind of like distant thunder'.

'Can't be thunder, it's dry season,' Mr Hart said, before he revealed that when he ventured out into his backyard a few days later he realised something was wrong when he came across a large crack in the earth.

Darwin river man Lance Hart was amazed when he discovered a gaping sinkhole just metres from his home

Though it's not the first of its kind in the area, this sinkhole is the biggest locals have ever seen.

Mr Hart likened it to the famous scene from Crocodile Dundee where Paul Hogan's character bragged, 'that's not a knife, this is a knife', and laughed that he now had the biggest sinkhole.

In a video posted to YouTube Mr Hart walked less than 50 metres from the back of his home and stood at edge of the gaping hole, which swallowed trees and boulders.

Mr Hart told Nine News he watched enourmous boulders swallowed by the water at the bottom of the hole

His footage shows the sheer size of the sinkhole, estimated to be 40 metres wide and drop down 15 metres to the point where it's filled with water. 'That, is a big hole,' Mr Hart narrated.

'I have no idea how deep that water is, but from the rocks that are still falling in to it... We're seeing massive boulders slide down and disappear underneath the surface so it's obviously very deep,' he continued.

Trees as tall as 20 metres which once stood tall where the hole now lies are nowhere to be seen, and experts are unsure whether the gap will continue to expand.

Neighbour Daniel Cocks told the program he was extremely grateful the gap didn't appear on his property, where he keeps his collection of 24 old Land Rovers.

'They're 30, 40 year old Land Rovers, I've got 24 of them... I don't really want to lose them, not in a great big hole,' Mr Cocks laughed.

At the end of the YouTube video, Mr Hart summed up his new backyard feature in one word: 'Amazing.'
