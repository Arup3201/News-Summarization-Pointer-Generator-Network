A woman has gone missing from a cruise ship after she disappeared while it sailed across the Atlantic Ocean.Â 

The 47-year-old, who has not been identified, was reported missing from the Celebration Cruise Line ship by her boyfriend when it docked at Port of Palm Beach in Florida yesterday. The ship left Grand Bahama Island at 8pm on Tuesday.

The man had last seen his partner, from Canada, at 1am on Wednesday when  he left her at a gift shop on board while he went to the casino before returning to their cabin.

When the man woke up and realized she had not returned, he notified the ship's crew at 8am.

Federal and local authorities along with the U.S. Coast Guard were searching for the missing passenger over an area of 900 miles.

Charles Kinnear, president of Celebration Cruise Line, told ABC: 'We've given [investigators] our complete track from when we left Grand 
Bahama last night, every position that we took during the evening.

'We're still hoping for the best - that somehow she sneaked off the vessel or she is still hiding somewhere.'

The woman was known to have boarded the ship in Grand Bahama as all passengers must use a swipe card when getting on and off the vessel.

Two searches of the boat, which holds 2,000 people, have now taken place. It is scheduled to leave on its regular route to Grand Bahama at 6pm this evening.

Celebration Cruise Line is the only company to run a two-night trip to the Bahamas.
