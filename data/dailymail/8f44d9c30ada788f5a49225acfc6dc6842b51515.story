She may have been thrown from the ninth floor of an apartment building, but this cute cat has certainly landed on her feet with plenty of loving friends to help her recover from her nightmare fall.

Christened Hei Hudie - meaning Black Butterfly - because of the black fur on her face and body, the unlucky moggie fell 32 feet down to the fifth floor of the block in the city of Chongqing, southwest China.

Her cruel assailant had reportedly stepped on her before flinging her to what could well have been her death, as reported in People’s Daily Online.

But the resilient feline survived the fall, which fractured her spine, and after four major operations in six months the eight-month-old kitty she is able to get around again using a wheeled brace.

The poor cat has lost the use of her hind legs and requires daily physiotherapy following the fall in the Jiulongpo Shiqiaopu area of Chongqing in November last year.

Eight-month-old Hei Hudie, or Black Butterfly, has to be encouraged to get around on her wheeled brace with cat food after suffering a terrible fall in the city of  Chongqing in southwest China

She can no longer use her back legs as a result of plummeting 32 feet - a fall which also fractured her spine

She has been inundated with well wishers at the Yu Bei Area Animal Hospital, including an anonymous woman who has put more than 10,000 yuan - nearly £1,100 - towards helping Black Butterfly recover.

Because of her frailty the director of the hospital, Cheng Yu, placed her in her office to make it easier to take care of her.

When she sees a stranger, Black Butterfly will hide her head under her blanket. 

Cheng has to gently take her out to pet her and before attaching the wheels to her back legs and encouraging her to walk with them attached using food as an incentive.

Black Butterfly weighs 2kg and the wheels make up almost 30 per cent of that weight. 

With her wheels attached she is able to gingerly walk on her two front legs and after a few steps she will stop for a rest then start over again.

Cheng said: 'She is still on the slow road to recovery and needs to exercise her front legs daily to develop the strength in them. 

The unlucky cat has made many friends since her fall, including one benefactor who gave nearly £1,100

Black Butterfly needs daily physiotherapy and has had to undergo four major operations in six months

'Last year we operated on her three times and had to repair her spleen, liver and bladder as well as amputate her hind legs.' 

Cheng said that earlier this month Black Butterfly suddenly developed a swollen cheek and to save her life they had to operate on her again on March 8 to remove a gland under her tongue. She is currently in good health.

After going under the knife four times she is not able to relieve herself in the normal way anymore and will have to use nappies every day.

Cheng added: 'Black Butterfly is lucky to survive the fall of more than 10 metres, not to mention the stress of four operations in the space of six months.

'From my more than 10 years as a vet I can say she has the strongest will to live of any animal I have seen.'  

The director said last week she told the story of Black Butterfly to an American client called Alison. 

Since then Alison has been coming almost every day to help with the lucky cat's recovery process.

Cheng says 'Alison also has some problems with her back and comes every day to accompany Black Butterfly through her exercises on the mechanical wheels.'

With her wheels attached Black Butterfly is able to gingerly walk on her two front legs and after a few steps will stop for a rest before starting over again 

Alison is a full time mother and her husband a car engineer and two years ago they moved to Chongqing together.

They have an eight-year-old daughter called Claire who studies at an international school in Chongqing. The family already keep four stray cats and dogs at their home.

As soon as Alison heard of the plight of Black Butterfly she immediately put out a call for help on Facebook and hopes one of her American friends in Chongqing may adopt the tough little cat. 

Alison, her daughter and two of Claire's classmates have been to the animal hospital to visit Black Butterfly.

Claire is concerned that the mechanical wheels for Black Butterfly are too heavy and the length is not suitable and needs to be fixed.

Alison said: 'I am very proud of my daughter.At home she helps with the cleaning, feeding and walking of our four strays. 

'Helping these animals will instil a stronger sense of empathy in her and will encourage her to be friendly to strangers.

'I will do my best to help Black Butterfly.'

Alison said she will get all of her daughter's class to care for Black Butterfly and hopes that she can quickly find a home of her own.
