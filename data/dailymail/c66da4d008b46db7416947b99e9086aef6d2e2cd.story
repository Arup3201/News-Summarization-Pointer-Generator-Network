Sean Day-Lewis, 81, reportedly fell out with his famous brother over a 'misunderstanding' about a biography of the actor - pictured with his Oscar

The estranged brother of Daniel Day-Lewis has revealed he is  desperate to end their 19-year feud sparked by an unofficial biography of the actor.

Sean Day-Lewis says that the Lincoln star – who last week made history as the first man to win three Best Actor Oscars – cut him off in 1994 and that the pair have not spoken since.

Sean said: ‘He [Daniel] phoned me up and told me to get a f****** life and to f*** off. I couldn’t get a word in. That was our last conversation. I have no means of getting hold of Dan now except through his agent.’

Sean, 81, insists that his only crime was to lend another author a copy of a biography he himself had written about their father, the former Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis.

‘I only gave him [the author] my book because I wanted him to get the facts right, and he didn’t even do that – he got birthdays on the wrong days,’ he said.

‘It was full of errors. He acknowledged my help in the foreword and Dan saw that and completely blew me out of the water.’

Asked if he hoped the notoriously private actor, 55, would one day end his silence, he said: ‘I would like that, very much.’

Sean also revealed in the  interview, published yesterday, how the pair had previously enjoyed a good relationship, despite the 26-year age gap between the half-brothers.

Their father had several affairs while he was married to Sean’s mother, Constance Mary King, before leaving her for actress Jill Balcon, Daniel’s mother.

‘We all got on quite well,’ he said. ‘Dan was a boy. I was allowed to beat him at ping pong.’

He claimed relations first began to 
sour while he was working on their father’s biography.

‘Jill liked it at
first, but when it got on to  the affairs, she marked the manuscript up
with more and more virulence,’ he added.

‘She came to hate me when the book came out.’

Although Sean and Daniel remained on good terms, the actor made it clear he did not want anything written about him.

Sean said: ‘He didn’t like me writing 
anything about him, naturally. Dan hates publicity and doesn’t like 
journalists, and I was in a tribe of hacks.’

Relations between the 
siblings suffered another setback when Sean discovered that his 
father’s gravestone had gone missing from the churchyard in Stinsford, 
Dorset, where he was buried following his death in 1972.

‘Without telling me, Dan and his 
sister Tamasin had decided their mother should be buried beside him,’ he
said. ‘I thought I might have been told at least.’

The stone has been replaced with Jill Balcon’s name on it.
