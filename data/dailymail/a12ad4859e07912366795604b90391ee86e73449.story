The mother of a teenager accused of hacking into the British equivalent of the FBI today told how she feared he would commit suicide as he appeared in court.

Rita Cleary, dressed in black, wore a pained expression as she watched magistrates remand her son Ryan, 19, in custody to allow police to quiz him about attacks on the  CIA and U.S. Senate.

But Mrs Cleary, 45, fears her son, who was described by a ‘vulnerable young man, would attempt to kill himself if he was not granted bail soon.

Cleary is accused of hacking the UK’s Serious Organised Crime Agency.

He appeared for the first time in 
public at the City of Westminster Magistrates Court after he was charged
 with five hacking offences.

The reclusive computer nerd is said to
 be ‘cooperating’ with Scotland Yard in  their probe into LulzSec, a 
hacking group which has claimed responsibility for  computer attacks on 
Soca website, the CIA,  U.S. Senate, NHS and games firms, Sony and 
Nintendo.

Today the loner was remanded in 
custody for up to three days to allow detectives to question him about 
other alleged computer offences in America, which could result in him 
facing extradition.

But his mother Rita, 45, warned that any attempt to extradite him to the United States would be a death sentence for him.

Today the alleged hacker, who suffers from agoraphobia, appeared anxious and frightened during the short hearing.

Just moments before he appeared in court, he warned his mother that he may attempt suicide.

Mrs Cleary told the Mail:  'He said, ‘If I don't get out, you know what I'll do mum”.

'That's his way of telling me he'll kill himself.

'His threat is very real and I'm terrified of what will happen if he is not given bail.’

Cleary also told his mother that he 
had not slept and asked her to bring some  detective crime novels, 
clothing and razorblades so he could shave. 

During the hearing, his tearful mother waved to her son from the public gallery.

Afterwards she said: 'It was a relief to finally see Ryan but it was clear he is not coping well.

'I'm very worried and anxious about what this is doing to his mental health. He  is a very vulnerable person.

‘He seemed very frightened. I told him to cooperate with police as much as possible.

‘This is his worst nightmare. All he wants to do is go home.

‘He told me, “Can you look after my cat, I love you mum”.’

Lawyers are now pushing for an urgent medical assessment of the troubled youth.

Yesterday District Judge Quentin Purdy granted police permission to continue  questioning him at Charing Cross police station.

Officers will be keen to know whether 
he carried out attacks in the US and  whether he can identify other 
hackers in the network. 

Ben Cooper, defending, said: 'The defendant is fully cooperating with the  police and wishes to continue to assist the police. 

'In those circumstances, I do not oppose the application for further  questioning.

'In view of the ongoing police 
interview I will not be applying for bail today  but I will be applying 
for bail on the next occasion when the interview process  has concluded 
and it is clear exactly what Mr Cleary is facing. 

'It should be made clear that Mr 
Cleary is a vulnerable man and certain matters  are being looked into 
with regards to his vulnerability.’

Dressed in a crumpled T-shirt and 
tracksuit bottoms, the pale and unshaven  defendant nervously bit his 
lip throughout the hearing.

Staring blankly at the packed courtroom, Cleary’s red-rimmed eyes were hooded  by deep bags.

He spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth during the  five-minute hearing. 

The defendant, who was arrested at his
 home in Essex on Monday as part of a  joint investigation by Scotland 
Yard and the FBI, has yet to plea to the  charges.

He is accused of taking part in 
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks -  coordinated assaults 
that cripple websites by overwhelming them with requests  for data - 
which briefly brought down Soca's site on Monday. 

He is alleged to have attacked the 
websites of the  British Phonographic  Industry's website in October 
last year and the International Federation of the  Phonographic 
Industry's website in November last year.

Cleary is also charged with conspiring
 with other people to create a  remotely-controlled network of zombie 
computers, known as a ‘botnet’, to carry  out DDoS attacks.

The offences under the Computer Misuse and Criminal Law Acts carry a possible sentence of 10 years.
