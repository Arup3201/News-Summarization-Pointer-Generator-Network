The number of students starting university has slumped by around 30,000 following the imposition of £9,000-a-year tuition fees.

The disclosure will fuel claims that the Coalition Government’s steep rise in maximum fees from £3,375 a year is deterring many youngsters from taking degree courses.

The shortfall of 28,634 students on last year is also set to cost universities hundreds of millions of pounds in lost fees and force the closure of struggling courses.

Slumped: The number of students starting undergraduate courses at university has fallen by 30,000 this year following the tuition fees hike

If overseas students from outside the European Union were stripped out of the data, the decline would be even sharper.

Demand for UK university places from home undergraduates and students from the EU – many of whom faced a near-tripling in tuition fees – has plummeted by 50,000.

Universities offset this to some extent by boosting their intake of students from outside the EU, whose fee levels are largely unchanged on last year.

The Universities UK group said more institutions had attempted to attract students through the post A-level results ‘clearing’ service than ever before.

‘Although there was much anticipation and trepidation in the run up to clearing this year, it has proved a real success,’ it said.

‘More institutions have entered clearing than in any other year.’

Figures from the UCAS university admissions service, cited by UUK, show that the number of students accepted through clearing rose by around 2,500.

Many elite universities used the system for the first time in years, partly due to an unexpected drop in the number of top grades at A-level this summer.

Reports also emerged of lower-ranking universities enrolling teenagers onto courses with as little as two E grades at A-level, prompting claims that ill-prepared youngsters were being ‘set up to fail’.

The UCAS figures also show that more than 187,000 candidates who made initial university applications ended up without places.

Admissions tutors say that many of these students - who were officially eligible for clearing - simply never materialised.

It is thought many fired off applications and only then began to fully understand the costs involved and failed to take the process forward.

Of the 187,000, 16,000 formally withdrew their applications, giving an increase in withdrawals of nearly 1,800 on last year.

Worth the cost? The decline in acceptances 
prompted a leading headmaster to warn that British universities were 
seeing a 'brain drain' to U.S. institutions

The data will prompt universities to carefully consider their fee levels for future years.

Controversial Coalition reforms allowed them to raise maximum annual charges this year from £3,375 to £9,000, although no money has to be paid upfront.

While headline fees for 2013/14 have already been decided, universities may be tempted to offer more generous bursaries or fee discounts.

In its analysis, UUK, which represents the executive heads of the country’s universities, said the reasons for the decline in acceptances this year - which amounts to about 6 per cent of last year’s 486,917 crop of students - were ‘complex’.

Researchers said the trend was partly driven by youngsters who applied for degree courses last year cancelling plans for gap years to avoid being liable for higher fees due to kick in this autumn.

There had also been a fall in the population of 18-year-olds following a dip in the birth rate.

But higher fees are still estimated to have put off an estimated 15,000 18-year-olds, and unknown numbers of older students.

‘UUK will continue to monitor closely how the picture evolves and the impact on institutions,’ it said.

In the final few hours of UCAS vacancy listings yesterday, more than 20,000 courses across UK universities and colleges still had available places.

These included several top universities such as York, Lancaster and Leicester. Some universities, mainly former polytechnics, still had vacancies on 200 or more courses.

While the course vacancy search has now closed, would-be freshers still have until October 22 to contact universities directly if they wish to inquire about available places.

The decline in acceptances prompted a leading headmaster to warn that British universities were seeing a worsening ‘brain drain’ to U.S. institutions.

Dr Anthony Seldon, master of Wellington College, said: ‘There is a real sense of dissatisfaction with UK universities: those of us in schools are very aware of that.

‘We are seeing the end of the inexorable rise in numbers going to universities in the UK.

‘A number of factors - financial, educational, cultural - have come together to persuade some of the great talents of this generation to seek their fortune in the U.S.

‘As numbers fall here all but the most selective UK universities will lower their offers as they seek to fill places. The consequences are predictable.’
