A report reveals anti-cholinergic drugs - used to treat asthma, high blood pressure, insomnia, dizziness and diarrhoea –- even affect everyday activities such as eating and getting dressed

Many drugs prescribed to the elderly could be to blame for a decline in their mental and physical abilities, warn doctors.

A report reveals anti-cholinergic drugs – used to treat asthma, high blood pressure, insomnia, dizziness and diarrhoea – even affect everyday activities such as eating and getting dressed.

Up to half of the UK’s elderly population are prescribed at least one medication with anti-cholinergic properties, which include antidepressants, antihistamines, sleeping pills and antipsychotics.

The heart drug digoxin, the blood thinner warfarin and the painkiller codeine have a mild anti-cholinergic effect.

Those with more severe effects include the antidepressant Seroxat, a drug for an overactive bladder called oxybutynin and schizophrenia drug clozapine.

Others are sold over the counter, such as some hay fever and heartburn remedies.

These medications affect the brain by blocking a key chemical messenger called acetylcholine, which has a range of functions.

As a result the drugs may trigger side-effects including dizziness, sedation, confusion, delirium, constipation and blurred vision, which although uncomfortable for young users may aggravate existing health problems in the elderly.

The research, by a number of centres including the University of East Anglia and the Regenstrief Institute in the US, will be published next month in Age and Ageing, a journal of the British Geriatrics Society.

It looked at 46 worldwide studies that included 60,944 patients who had taken anti-cholinergic medications for up to ten years. Two-thirds of studies were carried out in care homes, the remainder in hospitals.

A number of studies found the drugs were linked to a deterioration in physical function, while others showed a ‘negative effect’ on cognitive function.

The higher the dose of anti-cholinergic medication, the lower the physical functioning, which could be a cause of falls.

Dr Chris Fox, from UEA’s Norwich Medical School, said: ‘This is the first research to show a significant decline in physical, as well as cognitive, function.

‘This means patients could become less and less able to carry out everyday activities like walking around, feeding themselves, washing and getting dressed.

‘This is likely due to the direct effect on cholinergic neurons compounded by an increase in the blood-brain permeability.

‘We have also seen the type of drug may be important, and more research needs to be done to ascertain which types are more dangerous than others.’

The researchers advise that rather than taking sleeping pills with anti-cholinergic properties, people could skip naps, limit evening exercise and remove distractions from the bedroom.

Meanwhile, hospitals and nursing homes could work to keep older folk awake and stimulated during the day, naturally encouraging sleepiness, they said.
