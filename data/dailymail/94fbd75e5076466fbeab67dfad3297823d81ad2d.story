A drunk Mexican police dog handler has been sacked after swinging his dog around by its leash and slamming it into walls.

Arturo Kovalev, 38, was caught on video abusing his Doberman police dog so savagely that it almost died.

The video footage shot by laughing colleagues during a training day showed that they seem to find it amusing that he was drunk and picking the dog up by its choke chain, and throwing it over his back before smashing the animal into the wall.

He swung it around repeatedly, slamming the dog into a motorbike and against the wall.

He also picked the dog up and punched it in the ribs, causing several injuries that need to be treated by a vet.

The incident happened at the Mexican police training ground in the city of Cuautitlan Izcalli, in central Mexico.

The abuse is videoed for several minutes and only ended when officers finally stepped in to order him to leave the animal alone.

At this point he denied he had done anything wrong and insisted he was simply disciplining the police hound.

Kovalev was initially suspended for 30 days as a punishment but after officers considered the case and the fact that he had been drunk on duty, he was fired.

The dog survived but was given a discharge from police duties and is now in private hands. 

His colleagues have also been disciplined.
