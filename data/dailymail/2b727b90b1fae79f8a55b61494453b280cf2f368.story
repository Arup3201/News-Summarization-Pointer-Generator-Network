Ryan Bertrand has an interesting take on the match that made him famous overnight. Thrust into the starting XI against Bayern Munich on May 19, 2012, he did the job requested of him by Roberto Di Matteo to help Chelsea claim Champions League glory.

‘It’s something I don’t want people to forget, I’ve had success at the highest level,’ says Bertrand.

‘But, personally, I don't want to rest on my laurels, I've got the taste and it’s something I want to actively pursue. I want that again.’

It is that mentality that influences his next choice; to stick or twist. Bertrand does not want to be remembered solely as the shock selection that paid off; he craves fresh accomplishments.

He made 38 appearances last campaign, as well as earning two England caps, and when Chelsea turned down an approach from Liverpool in the summer Bertrand believed game-time under Jose Mourinho would follow.

Yet after only 244 minutes of action in the first-half of this season he went on loan to Aston Villa in January in search of football and has enjoyed a personally successful spell despite the team’s struggles.

This summer will be the most definitive of his career; talks with Mourinho will determine his future.

‘At the start of this season the aim was to play first-team football and that’s the impression I was under,’ says Bertrand. ‘That’s the reason I was at Chelsea; I’ve never been one to just sit there and be comfortable in my surroundings.

‘If you look at my record since I’ve been back at Chelsea from my loan spells (in January 2011), the games have been increasing by season – as long as I could see that I was always happy to stay

‘The start of this season has been the only time when there has been quite a delay in my development. As soon as those alarm bells were ringing it was important I got out to play.

‘It’s something we’ll sit down and talk about in the summer. At this stage in my career I need to be playing. To go back next year to Chelsea and sit on the bench is not what I want.

‘I feel I deserve the chance to play consistently, having had the experiences that I have done under numerous managers.’

At 24 years old that feeling is understandable. If Bertrand were to depart it would leave promises about increasing the number of home-grown graduates in the Chelsea team sounding hollow. Here is a player, signed by tribunal from Gillingham in 2005, who has developed through the system only to find a blockage at the end.

Villa represented a good opportunity and while a relegation fight was not on the agenda it has added a string to Bertrand’s bow. Brendan Rodgers, who Bertrand knows from his Chelsea days, was again interested in the winter window but by this time Liverpool were title challengers and Chelsea could not countenance assisting a direct rival.

Villa’s financial situation means a permanent switch to Birmingham for Bertrand, who has a house with his Brazilian girlfriend and two-year-old daughter in Surrey, is unlikely.

‘If I was to leave Chelsea I want to stay within the best teams in the Premier League. To keep my own ambitions to progress and play for England I need to be right up there, playing consistently at a decent level.’

Bertrand has two years left on his Chelsea contract but money elsewhere will not be a deciding factor. Nor will location, having been all over the country in six loan moves.

‘I was saying to my mate the other day: “I think I could drive round the whole country, no problem.”

I've been to Bournemouth on the South Coast; Oldham, that’s Manchester; Norwich, the far east of the country; Reading, towards the west country; Nottingham, the East Midlands; and Birmingham, West Midlands.

‘I’m looking forward to getting settled for the first time. It'll be purely about playing football.’

It was all about playing on the biggest stage two years ago. But his mum Debbie nearly did not travel to Munich.

‘I had given away my tickets and told her there was no point in her coming out, my chances of playing were at best slim,’ says Bertrand. ‘She ended up booking the flight anyway without me knowing. It must have been mothers’ intuition. Imagine if I'd played the final and she's been stuck at home – I'd never have lived it down.

‘That January there was talk of a move to Newcastle, then Di Matteo took over. That’s football. It can change at a drop of a hat. That’s why I always say, “Make sure you're training, make sure you're ready.”'
