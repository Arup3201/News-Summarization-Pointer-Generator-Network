Marine biologists scouring the seabed have discovered an new species of carnivorous sponge that bears a remarkable resemblance to a harp or lyre.

A team from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in Moss Landing, California, found the weird deep-sea predator off their state's northern coast.

They named the new species Chondrocladia lyra - or harp sponge - because the basic structure of its body is shaped like the musical instrument.

Using remotely operated deep-sea vehicles, the MBARI team led by Dr Lonny Lundsten collected two harp sponges and recorded video footage of ten more, sci-news.com reported.

The first speciments they discovered had only two vanes, but subsequent dives revealed examples with up to six vanes radiating from the creature's centre.

The sponges barbed hooks covering their branching limbs to snare tiny crustaceans before enveloping the creatures in a thin membrane and slowly digesting it.

The scientists who made the discovery believe that the harp sponge - which lives on the ocean floor at depths of between 10,800 â€“ 11,500 feet - has evolved its distinctive candelabra-like structure to increase the surface area it exposes to the ocean currents to catch its prey.

Sponges typically feed by straining bacteria and bits of organic material from seawater filtering through their bodies, and its less than 20 years since scientists first discovered some species that were carnivores.

'C. lyra is an extraordinary example of the kind of adaptations that animals must make in order to survive in such a hostile environment,' the MBARI team reported in the journal Invertebrate Biology.
