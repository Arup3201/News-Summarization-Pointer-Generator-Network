Simon Laxon has alkaptonuria, a highly rare genetic disease which often leads to a range of other conditions such as osteoarthritis, heart problems and kidney infections

A 46-year-old man is suffering with a million-to- one condition that gives him the body of a 90-year-old.

Simon Laxon, from Coventry, was diagnosed at birth with alkaptonuria or AKU, a highly rare inherited genetic disease. 

He is one of only around 80 people in the UK known to have the condition, which often leads to a range of other debilitating conditions such as osteoarthritis, heart problems and kidney infections. 

The rare disease - which gets its name because it can turn urine a blackish purple colour - is an enzyme deficiency which sees acid attack bones and cartilage effectively aging them far faster than normal.

The crippling pain caused by the condition has forced Mr Laxon to leave his job as a former brake systems engineer. 

The father-of-two said: ‘I feel like a 45-year-old in a 90-year-old’s body.'

As the condition has progressed, leading to severe joint and back pain, the keen sportsman, with a black-belt in Kung Fu, has had to give up his hobbies.

Despite knowing about his condition since he was a child, his symptoms only got worse in the last few years. 

‘I suffered from AKU even as a baby as my mother would tell the doctors about seeing the black and purplish marks in my nappy.’

And despite then being told the condition was harmless, research has since shown it is linked to severe early onset osteoarthritis. It causes cartilage to become black and brittle and break away.

Other symptoms include kidney and prostate stones created as the acid crystallises and heart problems due to calcification of blood vessels.

Now, Mr Laxon has become one of the first people in Britain to undergo pioneering new medical treatment at a first-of-its-kind UK clinic.

Now accepted on to a new trial using the drug nitisinone, Mr Laxon can live a more active life, pursuing his hobbies such as model-making

He is taking the drug nitisinone, a compound that started its life as a weed killer. It is currently used to treat hereditary Tyrosinemia type 1, a rare disease that leads to liver and kidney problems.

It’s thought the drug may stem the acidic effect caused by the enzyme deficiency, preventing the bones from being attacked.

Mr Laxon says the effects of the drug have been remarkable. ‘Since I went to the trial this summer I have been able to do so much more – even helping my wife with the DIY and decorating.

‘Not being able to work has been hard, as I was such an active person, doing kung fu and playing squash. I made brake pods and systems for tanks and cars.

‘It’s so liberating to be able to do the things I used to take for granted.’

He is expected to continue taking the drug for the foreseeable future.

The AKU centre at the Bone and Joint Centre in Liverpool has already treated 13 other patients.

Dr Lakshminarayan Ranganath, medical director of the AKU Society, told the Daily Express: ‘I believe nitisinone will effectively provide a cure. It won’t repair the genetic defect but it will block symptoms at an early age.’
