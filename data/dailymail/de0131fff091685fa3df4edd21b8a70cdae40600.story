A terminally ill bride has been granted her dying wish of a dream wedding after being given just six weeks to live.

Natalie Price, of Redditch, Worcestershire, planned her big day in just 20 days after being told her lung disease, which also claimed the life of her mother, was terminal on March 6.

The mother-of-two, whose eight-year-old son Bradley has just been diagnosed with the same condition - fibrosing alveolitis - and her partner of 11 years, Andy, planned the wedding to ensure they had a fairy tale wedding.

Andy sprang into action along with family and friends to make it happen. And yesterday Natalie enjoyed her dream wedding day as she married her long-term sweetheart in front of family and friends.

'I'm so happy to have finally married Andy,' Natalie, who lost her ten-week-old baby daughter, Paige, to cot death, said. 'Our wedding day was the best day of my life.'

Now the 30-year-old has just one more bucket list wish - to raise enough money to send her two sons, Callum, 11, and Bradley to Disneyland Florida after she dies to take their mind off the pain of losing their mum.

Andy, 48, said he was determined that Natalie would have the dream wedding she always wanted.

'Natalie and I have been together for 11-years and we are soul mates. We'd always wanted to get married but we just never got round to planning it.

The couple said they had always planned to marry after being together for 11 years

'After ten months of regular scans and X-rays to monitor Natalie’s health we were told the devastating news that she had declined rapidly and had just six weeks to live. We knew from that moment we needed to act fast.

'Our wedding day was the best day of our lives, it was perfect in every way - I just wish I could have my wife for longer than just a few short weeks.

'It was mine and Natalie’s dream to get married and thanks to our family, friends Lisa Dorgan and Laurence Walsh, and local businesses, we were able to fulfil that wish before it was too late.

'It breaks my heart to think about the future without her but I need to stay strong for our boys.

'Seeing Natalie come down the aisle in her dress allowed me to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute.

Fibrosing alveolitis is a relatively rare lung condition which causes scarring and thickening of the alveoli - tiny air sacs - leading to shortness of breath.

Developing over a number of months or years, the condition is difficult to treat and is usually long term.

In some cases, fibrosing alveolitis is the result of an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the body’s own healthy tissues.

However, about half of all cases are idiopathic, which means no cause can be identified.

'It was the most magical day and we will never forget it.'

Natalie’s wedding day was provided free of charge by Micheala Evans, manager at The Southcrest Manor Hotel, Redditch, who arranged for the registrar and 100 guests to attend the ceremony.

'I can’t believe how amazing our local community has been, they’ve made mine and Natalie’s dream come true and it’s a day we’ll never forget,' added Andy.

'She looked beautiful on our wedding day and our boys Bradley and Callum really enjoyed themselves too.

'Before the wedding we sat down with the boys and the Primrose Hospice to tell them that their mummy is going to die.

'That was the most difficult and heartbreaking thing we have ever had to do.'

Family friend, Lisa Dorgan, decided to help raise funds to pay for specialised treatment for Natalie in America by taking part in the 10km Birmingham Morrisons Run in May and so far has pledges amounting to £5,000 via her GoFundMe page.

'I've known Natalie for years as our mums were best friends,' she said.

'I decided to raise funds for her to go to Chicago for a life-saving transplant but Natalie’s health deteriorated so rapidly and after being given just weeks to live, that was no longer an option.

'The money raised is now going towards sending her boys to Disneyland as we managed to tick off her dream wedding without dipping into it.

'I’m over the moon that her big wedding day was organised so quickly and that her boys will hopefully get the chance to go on holiday as well.' 

'Natalie has been through so much in her short life,' said Andy.

'Her mother, Tracy, died of lung cancer at just 39, when Natalie was pregnant with our eldest son, Callum, so she never got to meet him.

'Then in 2006, Bradley was born and at four months old he was rushed to hospital with a collapsed lung. Bradley spent seven months in hospital and was later diagnosed with the same disease as Natalie.

'We now have the worry that he too will end up like his mum, although he is a normal healthy boy at the moment.

'The wedding helped us to forget all the heartbreak for just a minute.

'There are many people to thank and we will get round to doing just that.'
