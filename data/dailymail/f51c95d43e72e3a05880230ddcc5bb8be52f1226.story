Thug: Jai Falconer has been jailed for six years for beating up his mother Joyce, 69, over £20 

A thug addicted to drugs and alcohol broke his own mother's back because she refused to lend him £20.

Jai Falconer has been jailed for six years for the brutal attack on his pensioner mother Joyce, 69, in his childhood home.

A court heard the 40-year-old woke his mother up by banging on her door in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire at  7am on June 7.

Falconer told his mother he was going to make himself breakfast  before demanding to borrow £20.

When she refused he punched her in the face before throwing her to the ground and took cash from her purse.

Falconer then grabbed his mother by the throat and beat her with a plastic brush as she lay on the kitchen floor.

The pensioner managed to struggle to the front door and alerted a neighbour who had already dialled 999 after hearing the disturbance.

She was taken to hospital where it was confirmed she had a fractured vertebrae in her back.

Yesterday Falconer admitted robbery and grievous bodily harm at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court and Judge Paul Glenn jailed him for six years.

He also made him subject to a restraining order, preventing him from contacting his mother and going within 100 yards of her home.

Prosecutor Paul Farrow told the court Falconer, stole £60 and Mrs Falconer now wears a supportive brace and may need surgery on her back.

He added: 'He looked around the fridge and said he was going to have toast, and wanted £10. Then straight away he said 'no, give me £20'.

Shocking: Stoke Crown Court heard that Falconer beat his mother so viciously she broke her back before she crawled to the front door for help

'She said she didn't have any money. He asked where her purse was in an aggressive tone.

'Using his right fist, he punched her on the right side of the head. This blow knocked her backwards and she said she'd had enough of this.

'He pushed past her and rushed upstairs. His mother followed him. He went to her bedroom, grabbed her handbag and took out her purse.

'He went back to the kitchen and emptied the contents on the table.

'Ms Falconer told him to give her purse back and finally said she had had enough and was phoning the police.

'The defendant reached towards his mother, telling her she wasn't.

'He grabbed her by the throat, causing her to fall backwards and onto the floor.

'She lay on the floor, curled up in a ball. The defendant then began to hit her with a plastic kitchen brush, at least five or six times, striking her all over her body.'

Defending Falconer, Anis Ali said: 'It's clear that the catalyst of this offending appears to be his habitual use of illicit substances and alcohol.

'It was a sense of desperation that lead him to be in the situation he found himself. I don't condone what he did. It's a serious situation and unpleasant.

'He does express regret and understands what he did was wrong.'
