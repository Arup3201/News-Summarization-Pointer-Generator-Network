A single father was left red-faced when he received an anonymous note at a playground which accused him of being a poor parent.

Quills, the father-of-two, had taken his children out to a park in Sydney's inner west on Thursday morning while anxious about trying to find a place to live by next Saturday.

The 26-year-old believes a cowardly act was prompted by him spending time on his mobile phone to search for future homes while his son was asleep in his pram and his daughter was playing with other kids.

However this was unbeknownst to the scribe who left a note to the father, reading: 'Dear Mummys and Daddys, Please Get off Your Phones. Thank You! Your Kid.'

The note was written on a paper plate and left on the empty pram while Quills took his son to play with his sister

Quills, who became a single father this year, says the note made him feel 'violated'.

'For me it seems ridiculous because the person was being judgemental for no reason,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

When his one-year-old son Jasper awoke from his nap at Camperdown Memorial Rest Park in Newtown, Quills picked him up and took him over to play with his three-year-old sister Indigo while he quickly tried to finish off a message he was writing to a potential landlord.

'Then as I was walking back to the pram, sitting on the seat was a paper plate,' Quills said.

'There were a lot of people at the park - a lot of them on phones too - so I looked around, trying to see if anyone claimed responsibility for the note.

'No one did so I tore it up because I knew there was a good chance that the person was looking at me and I wanted to show them that it wasn't a worthwhile message.'

The note was a huge insult to Quills, a professional artist, as he's been trying hard for the last four months to make ends meet.

'I've been looking for a place online hoping to find somewhere to stay because I don't want to put my stuff on the street,' he said.

'But it's been a bit of a struggle because it's quite difficult to find a share house that will take in two kids.

'At one point I couldn't afford to feed myself and buy nappies or baby formula for my kids.'

Since Quills was evicted from his last Sydney home nearly four months ago, he's lived at three temporary homes.

While he is required to move out by next Saturday, the father-of-two hopes to finally settle down in his fourth home - for the sake of his kids.

For a single parent who only gains little support from his family, Quills said he's always been committed to being a good father.

'My dad was absent most of my life,' he said.

'So I've always wanted to be around my kids to play a role in their lives – a role that I wanted my dad to have in mine.' 

But since him and his partner of five years separated, the split custody of their children has left Quills shattered. 

The 26-year-old says being a good father has always been top priority to him

Quills took to Facebook and shared his thoughts on the recent incident

'It's devastating for me that I only get to spend half the time with my kids now,' he said.

'Both of them were planned and at the time my partner and I were prepared for them. 

'But one of the big changes in my life since becoming a single dad is that I often feel I am no longer allowed to engage with other people's children. People, particularly traditional mothers, tend to assume the worst of a lone young man taking an interest in their charges.'

So the recent incident has added salt to the wound, leaving Quills indignant which brought him to post his thoughts on social media.

'I just received this obscene gesture from some person,' he wrote.

'Maybe if you didn't have such rigid ideas about parenting you would realise that the world is actually a pretty nice place. 

'I think that it is, despite being typecast as a pervert or a distant parent for no good reason. It must be awful walking around making negative snap judgments about people all the time.'

Quills further told Daily Mail Australia that he hopes others think before they made judgements about single fathers.

'I think a lot of other parents agree with me that they often get judged too harshly for the way we choose to raise our children,' he said.

'I think people generally have their own idea of parenting and an idolised notion of it until they become one.'
