It doesn't get more romantic than this. An 80-year-old man in China has spent his life-savings to buy his wife of many years a diamond ring for because she has had 'a hard life'.

Staff at a jewellery store in Xinjiang, in the north-western province, were approached by the elderly couple and asked if they could see some 'reasonably priced' rings.

The OddityCentral website reports that the man wanted to make his wife happy because they had experienced of lifetime of struggle.

I think this will do nicely, thanks. The 80-year-old agrees the ring is the right one

'We’ve been leading a hard life,' the 80-year-old told the jewellery store employees. 'I just hope to cheer her up.'

A sales staff member picked out a reasonably priced and discounted diamond ring for the pair to look at and once it had been tried on, they began the process of payment.

What's more, according to the website, as the man pulled out a large roll of small banknotes he apparently revealed that what he was using was his life-savings.

Some reports suggest they have been together for at least 50 years and the man may have spent much of his life working as a cleaner.

His reason for buying the diamond ring? He said simply that 'she has had a hard life'

Locals took to social media to declare the moment among the most romantic they'd ever heard of.

All done. The pair finish up the purchase with the saleswoman. It's believed they may have been married for at least 50 years
