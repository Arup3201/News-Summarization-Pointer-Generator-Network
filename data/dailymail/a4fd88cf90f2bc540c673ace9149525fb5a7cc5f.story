Milton Keynes Dons' talented midfielder Dele Alli has been rewarded for his impressive start to the season by being handed the Football League Young Player of the Month award for August.

The 19-year-old, who has been linked with moves to Liverpool and Bayern Munich, scored twice during the month, against Peterborough and Crawley, and has since continued his form with another goal at the start of September.

Speaking to The Football League, Alli said of the award: 'I'm delighted, it's a good achievement but I couldn't do it without the team. It's a credit to be able to win this award in such a young team.'

'Without the manager giving me the opportunity and supporting me - I can't say thank you enough to him or the players.'

Alli's development at MK Dons was rewarded on Thursday, when he was given a contract extension until 2017. 

With plenty of admirers further up the league, it seems unlikely that Stadium MK will be his home for the duration, though. Brendan Rodgers is one manager keen on aquiring Alli's services, and the player is well aware of the interest.

'Before games, the gaffer will sit me down, tell me I'm being watched, and make sure I'm not getting carried away,' Alli told The Telegraph.

'I've heard he (Brendan Rodgers) has (been watching). It's not something I really worry about.'

Alli's talent was shown to the wider world last month, when his performance against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup turned heads.

MK Dons ran out comfortable 4-0 winners, and Alli admits that he enjoyed testing himself against top level oppostion.

'That game against United gave me great inspiration because that's where I want to be playing - in the top leagues against the top teams. 

'It showed I am capable of doing that eventually.'

For now though, Alli feels at home in Milton Keynes - the city in which he was born and raised - and will continue to impress until the big clubs come knocking.
