We all know that when it comes to doing as they're told, toddlers can take a little convincing before they comply.

However one particularly stubborn little girl refuses point blank to give into her father's demands and provides a compelling argument despite the fact she is not yet able to speak.

Irish father Gareth Roe was captured on camera telling his 15-month-old daughter Lola to get down off their television table.  

Adorable Lola seems absolutely adamant that she does not want to get down off the television table as her father, Gareth Roe, pleads with her 

But the defiant young toddler is determined to stay where she is and gets impressively mouthy with her dad, not letting her lack of speech stop her.

The  37-second video has received over one million views on YouTube and is currently being shared across social networking sites such as Twitter. 

The video begins with Gareth firmly telling his daughter: 'Get your foot down off that table!'

The super-cute 15-month old is clearly having a good time standing on top of the television table 

At one point Gareth leans over poking his cute young daughter gently in the stomach 

But little Lola is having none of it and shouts back at her father, shaking her head confidently while staring straight back at him.

Gareth then decides to point out that he is in charge and attempts to reinforce his authority with his daughter.

'You can't tell me what to do' he says while pointing a stern finger at her before adding 'I'm your boss until you're 18, now get down!' 

Lola does not seem intimidated by her father whatsoever and continues to shout and wave her arms. 

At this point Gareth decides to play on his daughter's muddled speech and pokes her lightly on the chest asking: 'What did you call me?' 

The person behind the camera, who we can only assume to be Lola's mother, then giggles as Lola shouts back at her unimpressed father. 

'Get down this second' he tells her one more time before Lola simply turns away, leaning nonchalantly on the laundry while ignoring her dad's request. 

At this point Gareth decides to give up the fight and the video finishes with him picking Lola and embracing her as the pair reconcile.

One thing that does remain unclear, more than Lola's broken speech, is how she got up there in the first place. 

Eventually Gareth gives up, hoisting his young daughter off the table and over his shoulder
