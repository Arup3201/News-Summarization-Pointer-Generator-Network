Travis VanderZanden has been accused of stealing trade secrets from rideshare company Lyft

The former chief operating officer of Lyft is being sued by the rideshare company for allegedly stealing more than 1,400 sensitive documents before joining arch rival Uber.

Travis VanderZanden has been accused of uploading the files to his personal Dropbox account before leaving Lyft in August. Weeks later, he joined competitor Uber as vice president of international growth.

Lyft claims some of the documents contained extremely confidential information, including the company's strategic plan for 2014, financial plans through 2016, growth data and international expansion plans.

The complaint, filed in San Francisco yesterday, alleges Mr VanderZanden  has used the confidential data in his current employment with Uber, Bloomberg reports.

'We are disappointed to have to take this step, but this unusual situation has left us no choice but to take the necessary legal action to protect our confidential information,' Lyft said.

'We are incredibly proud of the dedicated and people-powered culture that we've fostered to support drivers, passengers and the entire Lyft community and we will not tolerate this type of behavior.'

According to the complaint, Uber's lawyers told Lyft that Mr VanderZanden 'has no Lyft proprietary information in his possession, not now, not when he started at Uber, and not since he left Lyft'.

It is thought Mr VanderZanden left Lyft after falling out with its co-founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, over how the company was being run.

Lyft, whose drivers sport distinctive pink moustaches on their cars, is seeking to have the confidential documents returned and destroyed from Mr VanderZanden’s personal computer or any other devices he might be able to use to access it.

In addition, the company has accused Mr VanderZanden of soliciting Lyft employees to leave Lyft and to join Uber, including vice president of operations Stephen Schnell and fellow employee Ryan Fujiu.

Both Uber and Lyft use special apps to connect passengers who are their customers with drivers of vehicles for hire. The two San Francisco-based companies have battled in the taxi market since Lyft came onto the scene in 2012, three years after Uber.

Their rivalry has been dogged with allegations of backstabbing, spying, turf wars and driver-poaching. 

In an interview with Vanity Fair, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick openly acknowledged he tried to disrupt Lyft's funding efforts.

He told the magazine: 'We knew that Lyft was going to raise a ton of money and we were going [to their investors saying], 'Just so you know, we're going to be fundraising after this, so before you decide whether you want to invest in them, just make sure you know that we are going to be fund-raising immediately after.'
