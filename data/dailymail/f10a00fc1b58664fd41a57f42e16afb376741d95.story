An elderly woman has been left a prisoner in her own home for three months after the building's owners refused to mend a broken lift. 

Widow Florence Bailey suffers from heart problems and is too ill to get down the stairs of her flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester.

The 84-year-old, who has lived in the property for 14 years, last left her home in Rena Court in Sparth Lane, Heaton Norris, on September 21.

Trapped: Widow Florence Bailey has been stuck in her flat in Stockport since September 21 and cannot get down the stairs

She fears she will now be stuck in the top floor flat for Christmas and New Year.

The owners of the building, Northern Estates, refused to mend it claiming it will cost too much to fix. In addition, they are not legally obliged to provide lift access for people living there.

Mrs Bailey said: 'I am really missing going out, I don't like losing my independence. I feel like a prisoner in my own home.' 

The firm, which is based in Manchester, wrote to all the residents at Rena Court on September 22 saying repairs would cost £15,000 and it had been decided that it was not 'economically viable to continue to maintain the lift in operational condition'. 

Mrs Bailey, who used to run a sweet shop in Heaton Chapel with her late husband, has been relying on neighbours to get her shopping.  

The owners of Rena Court, Northern Estates, refused to mend the lift claiming it will cost £15,000 which it says is too much to fix

She said: 'I would normally get a bus to Stockport two or three times a week. I don't know when I will get out again.' 

'It is very frustrating, I feel guilty having to rely on the kindness of others. But they shouldn't have to do it - there should be a lift that works.' 

Sarah Woods, residential properties manager for Northern Estates, said: 'We have been working hard to identify the problems with the lift at Rena Court, but it has been deemed unsafe and beyond economic repair by our lift engineers.

'Under the circumstances, and because we cannot procure appropriate insurance cover, we have no alternative other than to de-commission the lift at this time for the safety of tenants.

'We sincerely regret any inconvenience or difficulties that this may have caused.' 

The company submitted plans to the council to renovate the flats in September 2010, including proposals for a new lift.

But the plans are yet to be approved. 

Mrs Bailey added: 'These plans could take years to go through, if at all. So then we would never get a lift. I just don't know what I would do then.'
