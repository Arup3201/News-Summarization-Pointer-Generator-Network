Liverpool fans hoping to watch their side take on AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round are in for a nasty surprise.

The Reds are only selling tickets to supporters who have been to their last 13 away games in the FA Cup, the first of which was just shy of 10 years ago at Burnley's Turf Moor.

In arguably the tie of the round Liverpool were drawn away to League Two AFC Wimbledon, the phoenix club risen from the ashes of Wimbledon.

League Two club AFC Wimbledon play their games at Kingsmeadow, with a full attendance of 4,850

The Wimbledon of old caused arguably the greatest upset in FA Cup final history when they beat Liverpool in 1988.

Liverpool will be hoping to avoid a repeat of Wimbledon's famous victory in front of a packed out crowd at the old Wembley. 

In fairness to Liverpool, one of the best backed teams in the world, Wimbledon's Kingsmeadow does only hold 4,850, but these have to be some of the strictest away ticket criteria ever.
