A council has been accused of wrecking a popular Easter holiday beach after it dumped 100 Christmas trees on it as part of an anti-erosion project.

The firs were stripped of their fairies and planted on Porthtowan, Cornwall, in January to help build a defence against pounding waves.

But residents – who have been threatened with legal action if they remove them - fear the eyesore will be damaging to the tourist trade, which is ‘vital’ to the local economy, over the long weekend.

Branching out: Sunbathers use the dumped Christmas trees as barriers on the Cornish beach

Cornwall Council said the trees would bind with the shingle and form a defence line of new dunes to stop the beach being eroded by waves.

But the Porthtowan Dunes Community Group say the plan has failed, leaving the battered and weather-beaten Christmas trees sticking out of the sand.

They claim it will make the beach a laughing stock when holidaymakers arrive this Easter.

Frustrated locals wanted to dig up 
the Christmas trees themselves but were threatened with legal action if 
they carried out ‘unauthorised’ work.

Residents say many of the trees simply blew away in winter storms, littering village roads and gardens with branches and debris.

Those
 that remained have gradually turned orange and died, leaving pine 
needles and splinters scattered across the golden sand, creating a 
hazard for bare feet.

Eco-campaign: The council's green move has backfired, with locals wanting to remove the trees

Rose Trengove, community group spokesman, said: ‘We were told by the council's dunes expert that the Christmas trees would be covered by sand come April.

‘We wanted to see if it would work, but it hasn't and is now an eyesore and a blight.’

The
 council has banned villagers - who were encouraged to take their 
Christmas trees to be planted on the beach in January – from taking them from the beach.

A plan to hold a community event to remove the trees was stopped at the last minute after Cornwall Council stepped in.

A letter from countryside officer Jolyon Sharpe warned members of the Porthtowan Beach Management Group they could face legal action if they pushed ahead.

It read: ‘If the group feel that it is appropriate to act independently of Cornwall Council it will have to consider its options regarding taking action to prevent such unauthorised interference and any appropriate recompense.

‘I would sincerely hope that we can work together to ensure the most appropriate outcome for this area and that the Council will not have to resort to such a response.’

'Alienating visitors': The Christmas trees will prevent tourists from visiting, according to locals

Luke Morris, who runs the Blue Bar 
yards from the straggly stumps, said the trees are now 'an eyesore on 
what is a fantastic beach'.

He added: ‘It's alienating visitors at a time when Cornwall, as a whole, needs as much support as it can get.’

The council claimed in January that the trees would act as 'wind traps' and allow grass to grow and bind the sand together, to stop the beach being gradually washed away by storms.

Making do: Local residents are still using the Cornish beach but fear tourists will stay away this weekend

Cornwall Councillor Joyce Duffin said ‘I can't comment if the trees are or are not working, though I think they are trapping some of the sand.’

About the villagers' threat to uproot the trees, she warned: ‘They would need to have permission because it's council land.’

Secluded Porthtowan has a long-standing problem with sandstorms being whipped up the sea, damaging local homes and businesses.

Hazard: The Christmas trees have shed prickly pine needles over the popular Cornish beach

Cornwall Council's Natural Environment Manager Jon James said the authority was in talks with experts about what to do next.

He said: ‘We do not want to take any action which could be detrimental to the protection of properties, so we are seeking independent expert advice from a specialist company to fully understand what works are required for the long-term future and stability of the dune system and to determine the best course of action.

‘The recent storms which Cornwall has suffered has clearly demonstrated the importance of the dune systems in protecting Cornwall's coastline and we need to ensure that all parties take a measured approached to ensure that we retain the best level of protection to communities.’
