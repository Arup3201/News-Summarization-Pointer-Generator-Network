Esther McVey: She said the cash was a personal donation by Henry Angest, not by his company

An employment minister was under fire last night after accepting a £10,000 donation from the head of a controversial high-cost loans company.

Esther McVey's constituency party received £10,000 from Henry Angest, boss of the company that owns Everyday Loans. The firm offers personal loans to people with bad credit ratings.

It provides unsecured loans at interest rates of up to 80 per cent APR – much higher than the rate available to those whose finances are secure enough for them to borrow from their bank.

Critics said it was wrong of the Tory MP for Wirral West to accept the money from a man behind a firm charging vulnerable poor people such high rates.

The move is particularly controversial because Miss McVey is a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions, the ministry accused of cutting benefits.

Although Everyday Loans charges borrowers up to 80 per cent APR, this is not as much as 'payday lenders' such as Wonga, whose rates can be as high as 4,000 per cent.

Everyday Loans does not offer short-term loans designed to last until the next pay day. Its loans are more long term.

Mr Angest is chairman and chief executive of Arbuthnot Banking Group, which owns Everyday Loans. Over the past decade, the banker has given the Conservatives £7million in loans and donations.

Latest Electoral Commission figures show that in the first quarter of 2014, he gave the party £17,500.

Miss McVey, a former presenter on Children's BBC and GMTV, received £10,000 in February. Last night Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West, said: 'At the same time as working in a department which is being harsh and ruthless to people with tiny incomes, she is accepting money from someone in charge of a company exploiting the weakness of the most vulnerable.

'No politician should appear to be in hock to any donor, because it gives the impression that any decision taken is influenced by sponsorship.'

Mr Flynn said there should be no need for politician to accept such money anyway, because stringent caps on how much can be spent during election campaigns means large donations are unnecessary.

'The amount they need for campaigning can be raised from jumble sales and raffles,' he said. Miss McVey has a majority of only 2,436. Yesterday she told her local newspaper, the Liverpool Echo: 'This is a bank – and a bank that did not need a bailout from the taxpayer. And the donation came from an individual who is the chief executive officer of the bank, not through any company at all.'

Last night a source close to the minister said Mr Angest's company 'fully complies with all the laws and regulations they are subject to'.

Everyday Loans has more than 30 branches around the country. Its website says many people on low incomes are 'struggling' because of the Government's failure to put up the minimum wage to £7 an hour.

Mr Angest is not the only Tory donor with links to high-cost lenders. Venture capitalist Adrian Beecroft, who has given the Conservatives just under £800,000 in the past seven years, has a major stake in Wonga.

A spokesman for Arbuthnot Banking Group said: 'This was a personal donation and is completely above board.'
