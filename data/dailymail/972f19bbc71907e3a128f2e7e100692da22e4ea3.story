Kell Brook successfully defended his IBF world welterweight title against Romanian Jo Jo Dan at Sheffield's Motorpoint Arena on Saturday night.

Brook defeated his challenger in four murderous rounds before fans joined him in calling out Khan for what Brook envisages as ‘the biggest fight out there for both of us.’

‘Who do you want to see me beat next,’ he asked. ‘Khan, Khan, Khan’ came the crowd's response.

Brook's triumph and return to the ring came just six months after surviving a machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg.

It's all over and Kell Brook remains the IBF world welterweight title holder.

JEFF POWELL: Brook's red shorts covered that wound on his left leg but there was no hiding place for his challenger.

Dan was taking right hands to the head as if by habit and he went down for the third time from an accumulation of blows. Make that a fourth, Dan falling a split second before the bell. American referee Earl Brown completed the statutory eight count before agreeing with the challenger's corner that enough was enough.

10-9.

JEFF POWELL: Brook was looking for the finish but Dan managed to weather the storm at the opening of the round – and somehow fought back. The Brook attack was relentless and Dan reeled around the ring like a drunk, yet still made it to the end of another three minutes of hell.

10-9

JEFF POWELL: There were no signs of distress from that left leg which had been savagely severed. This time it was Brook inflicting the pain. 

One sharp sent Dan reeling. The next, an uppercut, put him down. The third sent him to the canvas again.

Only a mix of gallantry and clinching got Dan through more punishment to the bell, which seemed more likely to have condemned him to a continuing world of pain rather than to have saved him.

10-7

JEFF POWELL: Dan had pronounced himself ready not only to rumble but to ignore the sound and fury of the partisan Sheffield crowd. He started brightly enough to suggest nerves might not be problem but he promptly pressed forward, playing into Brook’s preference for counter punching.

The home boy’s straight lefts over the Canadian based Romanian’s southpaw leads were especially effective and he was off to a good start. 

10-9

JEFF POWELL: The Motorpoint Arena was packed to the tank-full, waiting to welcome the fighter Sheffield believes can be its successor to Naseem Hamed.

That atmosphere generator had to be restarted after the electric shock of seeing another son of the Steel City, Adam Etches, brutally knocked out by his veteran Belarus rival for the IBF international middleweight belt.

The deeply experienced 40-year-old Sergei Khomitsky drew Etches into a clever trap midway through the third round, opening him up for the perfect right cross.

Etches went down like an axed tree, crashing his head against the canvas as he landed, and there were no protests as referee Howard Foster instantly waves his arms over the prone body and summoned medical assistance.

Video-screening of Brook’s triumphs in the ring and his leg-slashed tribulations outside the ropes restored he mood of optimism.

Special K came in to a thunder of expectation and to be greeted by famed Ready to Rumble announcer Michael Buffer.

The 28-year-old's Sheffield homecoming has finally arrived.

Dan makes his way to the ring with a smile on his face and is looking calm and confident.

Kell Brook has vowed not to make the same mistake as the man from whom he ripped the world crown.

Brook had been considered a convenient underdog when he went to California in August and surprised the incumbent champion Shawn Porter to wrest the belt by split decision.

Brook's trainer Dominic Ingle said: 'Shawn Porter under-estimated Kell Brook and believed his own hype and then he was forced to admit he had over-looked him.

'There is no danger of Kell overlooking Jo Jo in the same way. Jo Jo has got into the mandatory position and he wants to win that title. Kell is looking for big fights ahead but Jo Jo sees no reason why he shouldn't get them too.'

Kell Brook is talking about fighting Floyd Mayeather or Manny Pacquiao, Juan Manuel Marquez or Brandon Rios — in no given order — before a Wembley blockbuster with Amir Khan sometime next year.

Nothing wrong with ambition but the first question Brook has to answer comes in his home town of Sheffield tonight.

It has less to do with his undeniable boxing ability than with whether he truly is recovered from the machete attack which inflicted horrific wounds to his left leg.
