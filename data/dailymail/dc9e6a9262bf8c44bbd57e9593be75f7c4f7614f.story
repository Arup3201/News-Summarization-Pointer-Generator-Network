Care: A study has found a third more heart attack patients died a month later in Britain than Sweden

More than 11,000 deaths of heart attack patients could have been avoided if British care was as good as Sweden's, a study has claimed.

A third more Britons than Swedes died within a month of having a heart attack, according to the research on half a million patients.

Scientists from University College London examined death rates in the two countries between 2004 and 2010.

They said a key reason for the striking difference between the two was that British patients are not receiving the best possible treatment.

Professor Harry Hemingway, from University College London, said: 'Our findings are a cause for concern.

'The uptake and use of new technologies and effective treatments recommended in guidelines has been far quicker in Sweden. This has contributed to large differences in the management and outcomes of patients.'

In total, the team analysed records relating to 391,077 patients from 242 hospitals in the UK and 119,786 from 86 hospitals in Sweden.

They found that 30 days after a heart attack, 10.5 per cent of patients discharged from hospital were dead in the UK compared with 7.6 per cent in Sweden.

At the start of the study the difference was even more stark, with almost 50 per cent more patients dying in the UK than in Sweden. But by 2010, the gap had narrowed to 20 per cent.

Taking into account age and sex differences, heart attack severity, risk factors including rates of smoking and diabetes, and other influences, the scientists estimated that over the study period 11,263 British lives could have been saved by matching Swedish standards.

Co-author Dr Tomas Jernberg, from the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, said: 'Our findings suggest that failure to get the best treatment is one likely reason why short-term survival for heart attack patients is lower in the UK.'

Concerning: The study, which looked at half a million patient records, said surgery and drugs like beta blockers were offered earlier and more often Sweden than in Britain, and processes must be improved

The study found drugs such as beta 
blockers were less likely to be prescribed to British patients and surgery on constructed coronary arteries were used earlier and more often in Sweden - 59 per cent of the time compared with 22 per cent in the UK.

The research was published in the medical journal The Lancet.

Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The reasons behind the differing survival rates are complex, but one explanation could be the speed with which the two countries adopted primary angioplasty as an emergency treatment.

'Sweden's early adoption meant they saw the benefits quicker and this is reflected in the figures. However, the UK has caught up and last year the majority of patients received this treatment.

'The lesson here for the UK is that we need to be led by the research and introduce pioneering practices quickly and on a large scale.'
