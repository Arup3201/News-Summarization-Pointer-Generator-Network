Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella has suggested that his side might have got the better deal when Egyptian winger Mohamed Salah moved to La Viola on loan as part of Juan Cuadrado's January transfer to Chelsea. 

Chelsea paid £27 million to prize Cuadrado away from the Serie A club with Blues outcast Salah offered as a makeweight exchange. 

But, after banking that huge sum and overseeing a fine run of form from Salah, Montella believes that Fiorentina have coped with the sale of their previous star man very well.

Speaking after Salah had scored Fiorentina's second goal in a 2-0 victory over Tottenham in the Europa League's round of 32, Montella told Goal.com, 'Who did better out of the Cuadrado exchange? Fiorentina earned a lot of money and, on the pitch, they are similar players.' 

'Salah is a player that, even if he takes some breaks, is devastating over 40 or 50 yards,' he added.

Fiorentina are currently fifth in Serie A with 39 points, six behind third-placed Napoli, who occupy Italy's third and final Champions League qualifying spot; and will look to close that gap starting with their trip to Inter Milan on Sunday.
