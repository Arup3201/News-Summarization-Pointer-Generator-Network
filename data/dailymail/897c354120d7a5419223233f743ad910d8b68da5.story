Suburbs with higher percentages of younger residents will experience a bigger growth in value from having railway constructions, a new study has found. 

Onthehouse Research found the suburbs where the median age of residents was below the national average of 37 years showed a stronger relationship between train stations and price growth.

The new stations will allow younger residents to access Sydney CBD, therein generating thousands of jobs.

The seven suburbs to watch out for are Kellyville, Rouse Hill, Bella Vista, Baulkam Hills, Paddington, Randwick and Kingsford.

'In Kellyville, the building and maintenance of the station, increased dwelling construction and new commercial establishments are expected to create over 3,000 jobs in the area, said Eliza Owen, Onthehouse market analyst.

'Whereas in Kingsford, where one third of the residents fall between 20-29 years old, the light rail is expected to be popular with young people and students travelling to the city for entertainment and work outside of study hours.'
