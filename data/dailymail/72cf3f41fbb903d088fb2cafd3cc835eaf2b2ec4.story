Two registered sex offenders stand accused of raping and killing four California women since October of last year - and police believe there are likely more victims.

Transients Franc Cano, 27, and Steven Gordon, 45, were each charged Monday with four felony counts each of special circumstances murder and rape of women with histories of prostitution, but more charges are likely to come.

Both accused killers were wearing ankle monitors last fall when the women were killed in Anaheim and Santa Ana, Anaheim Chief Raul Quezada said during a Monday press briefing.

Gordon has admitted to killing a raping five women, a police source told CBS Los Angeles, but no information regarding the fifth victim has been made public.

The case broke open when the body of Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, was found on a recycling plant conveyer belt, authorities said.

'The lifestyle that we are aware of of these four individuals, their pattern of behavior and the location where they frequented ties the four of them together,' said Anaheim Police chief Ralph Quezada.

Officials said they also used both the GPS readings from their ankle bracelets and their supposed victims' cell phone records to match up the times and places where the slayings are believed to have occurred.

The discovery brought to an end the serial killings, but investigators said they are convinced there is at least one more victim, and perhaps several more even outside of California, cops said.

'They put a stop to a serial killing that would likely have continued beyond this point,' District Attorney Tony Rackauckas added.

Both men were arrested Saturday and 
charged Monday with four counts each of special circumstances murders 
and rapes of Estepp, Martha Anaya, 28, Josephine Vargas, 34, and Kianna 
Jackson, 20.

Special 
circumstances murder charges are filed when the killings are committed 
during rape or when there is more than one victim, according to the 
Orange County District Attorney's Office.

If convicted, the men could face a minimum sentence of life without parole or the death penalty.

Authorities believe the two men have 
known each other since at least 2012, when they chopped off their ankle 
buses and rode a Greyhound bus to Las Vegas under fake names before 
eventually being arrested and returned of California.

They
 were required to check in with police every 30 days after that and 
provide addresses, finger prints and photos - but that didn't stop their
 violent rampage.

Jackson, their first-known victim, went missing October 20 in Santa Ana.

She had flown in from Vegas to face prostitution charges and disappeared shortly after her court hearing, even failing to check in with her mother.

Vargas
 went missing October 24 after leaving a family party. She had battled 
drug addictions and had a history of prostitution, her family said, but 
they insisted she was trying to better her life.

Anaya
 went missing November 12 after asking her boyfriend to pick up her 
five-year-old daughter from school so she could work that night. She 
also had a history prostitution charges.

'It's so hard for my family, so hard for my sister. We've been doing a lot of things to find her,' Anaya's aunt, Angelica Salcedo, told KABC. 'It's so hard, there's no word to explain the pain.'

Anaya's grief-stricken daughter struggled to find words to comprehend what has happened to his mother.

'My mom was a good person, I don't see why anyone would want to hurt her in any way,' Melody Anaya told the station before pausing to gather her thoughts. 'She didn't deserve it.'

Their bodies still have not been found, according to KABC.

Long haul ahead: Police found Estepp's body at this recycling plant, but will now begin searching local landfills for the other four victims

Estepp was known among local law 
enforcement for frequenting an Anaheim road known to Johns as an easy 
spot to score prostitutes.

After her body was found on the conveyer belt, evidence led to Cano and Gordon.

Authorities then linked the previous missing women to her case and realized they had potential serial killers on their hands.

Without any leads on where the other bodies may be, police admitted to CBS Los Angeles they will begin searching to local landfills for their bodies.

They are being held without bail and are scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday.
