So, it transpires, it is going to take more than the zap of a turbo smile from a £60million footballer to lighten the mood at Old Trafford. It will take more than the dazzle of his diamonds and the glisten of gel in his hair.

It has been a gloomy few days of introspection since the mauling in Milton Keynes and Manchester United’s unveiling of Angel di Maria, the most expensive player ever signed by a British club, was not enough to unfurrow Louis van Gaal’s brow.

There would be no quick fix, no miracles and no magic, warned Van Gaal, stern beside Di Maria. The mood was enhanced by the choice of Going Down by the Stone Roses as the soundtrack to the event.

Manchester United £401.2m

Manchester City £344.15m

Chelsea £341.8m

Liverpool £245.8m

Arsenal £209.5m

Di Maria must have wondered why no-one had warned him.

Still, the 26-year-old Argentine seemed happy enough to be there, nodding and explaining through an interpreter how he was here to win trophies and help United back to the top. He would, he stressed, be happy to play in any position, and was not concerned by his price tag.

His unburdened delight began to ebb away, however, when Van Gaal intervened and suggested his own words ought to be translated for the benefit of Di Maria, in effect providing the new arrival with a handy summary of a dismal start to the season.

It certainly isn’t like this at the Bernabeu. When Real broke records to sign Gareth Bale they packed the stadium and put their new Galactico on a podium to juggle the ball while fireworks were shot into the sky.

Di Maria was shoved before the in-house television station for a quick interview, snapped holding his new shirt and sat before a brisk press conference, held without irony in the Europa Suite on a day when the Champions League draw was going on without United for the first time in nearly 20 years.

Di Maria will wear No 7, an iconic shirt at Old Trafford.

‘I was aware of the importance of the No 7 shirt,’ said Di Maria. ‘Cristiano Ronaldo had spoken to me at Real Madrid and told me how important it was. The club also wanted me to wear it so I want to live up to it.’

Ronaldo said on Thursday night: ‘I wish the best to him, he’s a fantastic player, he’s going to do well at United. I said to him “No 7 is a big responsibility” but he will be able to take that shirt because he’s a fantastic player. Personally, it’s a shame for me because I liked Di Maria.’

Manchester United, of course, have no pretension to mimic Real’s obsession with glitz and glamour. For all their global reach and commercial power, they have always been a club where substance matters more than style.

And perhaps here is where Di Maria fits in, with his reputation for humility and hard work, which he combines on the pitch with his pace and superhuman stamina to great effect.

‘He is a very modest guy,’ said Van Gaal. ‘He wants to work. He showed that last year. He played 52 matches and gave 22 assists. How many players can say that? It means you are a social human being and in the football world that is not always the case.

‘He will be a player who can enjoy defence. It is important that he is a team player. He can accelerate our play but also plays in interests of the team. He fits our philosophy. What’s more, he means I can change the system.

‘He played at Real Madrid not only on the right wing but also in midfield. That’s also a reason we are convinced he will succeed. But he has been with us for two days. He has to adapt to the team and the team to him. We cannot expect that he is a miracle after two days. No, you have to work for the miracle and he knows that.’

Patience and time was central to the message, as well it might be. David Moyes was granted only one summer transfer window after replacing Sir Alex Ferguson and Van Gaal is three days from the end of his first.

Asked if he was surprised at the scale of the work required, only 15 months after United’s last title, the Dutchman said: ‘Yes, but that is looking at the past. That’s a question I don’t want to answer because I want to show my respect to David Moyes and Mr Ferguson.

‘We have to look at the future and we are doing that by restoring and rebuilding a new team. That costs time — I’m sorry to say that, sorry for the fans because the fans are amazing. We lost 4-0 in MK Dons and they were singing and supporting the players. I hope we will fulfil their expectations, but it is not done in one month.’

United will attempt to follow the signing of Di Maria with more, with sights set on William Carvalho, Arturo Vidal and Daley Blind. They will also hope to soon have Marcos Rojo available. He was in Madrid on Thursday awaiting a work permit.

‘Also, players shall go,’ said Van Gaal. Aston Villa last night had an £8m bid for Tom Cleverley accepted, with Hull and Everton also keen. Javier Hernandez is in talks with Juventus and Valencia and Wilfried Zaha has returned to Crystal Palace on loan. Di Maria can be forgiven if his head was in a spin. He must have wondered what was changing in the background as he smiled for the cameras in the crash of the flashbulbs.
