A Hollywood-style sign on a hillside overlooking Bristol which read 'BRISTOLAND' has been removed - after jokers re-arranged it to read 'IT'S BLAND'.

The original sign - seen as a good advert for the area - mysteriously appeared overnight on the side of the picturesque Avon Gorge in January.

But on Sunday night, jokers accessed the site and removed some letters before adding an apostrophe to produce the sign 'IT'S BLAND'.

The original Hollywood-style sign became popular with locals after it appeared on the slopes in January

But the new feature has been removed after jokers rearranged the letters to spell out IT'S BLAND

The National Trust, which owns the site, then stepped in and removed all the letters on Monday because the new wording was considered 'inappropriate'.

Head warden Bill Morris said: 'We can see the funny side of Bristoland, but we always said the sign had a finite life and the change to It's Bland was the point to remove it.'

It is still not known who created the original sign or the altered one.

Mr Morris added: 'I certainly wouldn't have liked to have put them up - it's a pretty steep slope so it would have been a difficult job.

'It was fun while it lasted and I hope they can come up with something new.'

The original sign appeared on the slopes of the pretty Avon Gorge near Bristol in January

The original sign was hailed by organisers of the local arts festival, Upfest, after it mysteriously appeared on the hillside earlier this year.

People in Bristol have hit back at claims their local area is boring.

They proudly boast their city is 'the street 
party capital of the UK' and was named one of the worldâ€™s top 10 cities to visit 
according DK Eyewitness guides.

Top attractions include Isambard 
Kingdom Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, popular theatre the Hippodrome, 
and the Cabot Circus shopping centre.

The city has a history of guerilla public art - and is peppered with works by world-famous artist Banksy.

Other well-known former residents include illusionist Derren Brown, model Sophie Anderton and TV chef Keith Floyd (above).

It was fixed to mesh fencing halfway up a
 rock face and the 8ft high letters became a familiar site to commuters 
on the busy A4 Portway into the city.

Upfest's Stephen Hayles, who was sent images of the original letters by street artists shortly after the word first appeared, hoped the sign would become permanent.

He told MailOnline: 'I'm a little bit sad that it's gone, but that's the nature of art like this I suppose.

'Fair play to whoever got up there, as I'd have thought it was no mean feat. And fair play for putting the apostrophe in.

'I don't know what they were trying to say, whether they thought the original wording was bland or something else, because Bristol is definitely not a bland place.'

The famous Hollywood sign in California was unveiled in 1923 and originally spelled out 'Hollywoodland', the name of a nearby housing development.

Mr Hayles said his group are hoping to meet the National Trust to arrange a longer-lasting feature on the hillside site.
