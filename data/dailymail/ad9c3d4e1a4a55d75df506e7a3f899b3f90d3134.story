The new series of Broadchurch is providing millions of TV viewers with a weekly cliffhanger.

But fans following in the footsteps of the stars are in danger of creating their own drama.

Hundreds are flocking to the 80ft cliffs at West Bay in Dorset, where the ITV show is set, risking a fatal fall from the crumbling edge or creating a landslip that could kill anyone passing below.

Despite signs warning sightseers to stay away, one group of three was photographed with legs dangling over the edge.

The shocking photos, taken by a local, show people sat right on the edge of the 80ft cliffs in West Bay

Passers-by stopped to take pictures of the shocking scene which put both the people on the cliff and anyone standing under it at risk

The photograph of the three thrillseekers was taken after the first episode of the second series was screened last week.

The photographer, who asked not to be named, said yesterday: ‘I was walking towards West Cliff when I saw the scariest sight. Perched right on the edge were three people taking photos. They were sat with their legs dangling over the edge for at least ten minutes.

‘At ground level, others were concerned about their reckless, shocking and irresponsible behaviour.’ 

Mark Collins, from West Bay Coastguard, said: 'Anyone going that close to the edge is risking themselves, anyone below them and us if we have to go and rescue them.

'I don't understand why people don't heed the warnings, there have been several accidents there.

'People tend to want to look over the side and they don't quite realise they are just stood on turf with nothing below.

'It's hard to say what effect the new series of Broadchurch will have. Local people know how unstable the cliffs are, it's visitors that don't understand the risks, but there are signs at every entrance to the cliff walk so people should see them.' 

Tourists standing at the edge of cliffs can dislodge rocks that could fall and injure people below

Ironically, the show’s TV crew were themselves criticised for taking ‘silly risks’ as they set up their cameras just yards from a cliff edge while filming the current series. 

One hotel booking website said interest in Broadchurch had already led to a 200 per cent increase in holiday searches for Dorset and Somerset, following the airing of the second season.

Meanwhile, the show is also having an effect on property prices.

The 100-year-old chalet in West Bay used in the series as the home of Detective Inspector Alec Hardy (Tennant) is for sale at £275,000.

The price is an example of what local estate agent Malcolm Gill calls the ‘Broadchurch effect’, which added up to £50,000 to its value.

The ITV drama, starring Olivia Coleman and David Tennant, has returned to screens for a second series

The West Bay and Bridport area experienced an increase in visitor numbers after the first series was aired in February 2013.

Fans flocked to the area to view the now famous spots, including the cliffs where 11-year-old Danny Latimer was found dead at the start of the first series and the West Cliff chalet which was later revealed to be the murder scene.

This influx of visitors is expected to start again after the second series started airing on ITV last Monday.

Geologist Richard Edmonds, from Dorset County Council, said the main risk was to people on the beach below if rocks at the top are dislodged.

In July 2012, 22-year-old holidaymaker Charlotte Blackman was killed by a rockfall at nearby Hive Beach at Burton Bradstock.

Mr Edmonds said: 'People don't seem to think these continuous safety warnings apply to them but that is very much the case.

'The main thing to be concerned about is that they might dislodge rocks and hit people below on the beach.

'The top of the cliff is quite weathered and climbing around by the edge could cause rocks to tumble down and really hurt someone.

'We want people to enjoy themselves, it's just a matter of being sensible.

'They might think they are not going to fall but that's not the main risk. They should think about other people and not do anything stupid.'

The mystery drama has a;ready prompted a tourism boom to both Dorset and Somerset, where it is shot
