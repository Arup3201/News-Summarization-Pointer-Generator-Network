A heartbroken husband has revealed his young wife cried 'My love, we're going to die!' before she and their 17-day-old son were killed in the Oklahoma City tornado last week.

Maria Pol Martin, 26, uttered her final words to  Miguel Chicoj seconds before  the EF5 tornado ripped her and her son, Rey Chicoj Pol, from the family's minivan along Interstate 40 on Friday evening.

Her husband and their two other children, five-year-old Juan Chicoj Pol and one-year-old Tomasa Chicoj Pol, were injured but survived when their vehicle was thrown into a field.

As he recounted his devastation to The Oklahoman, Chicoj revealed that he accidentally had driven his family into the deadly tornado's path.

The family left their home near Hinton to go to Oklahoma City to check on insurance coverage he needed for hand surgery, and began returning home at around 6pm.

Chicoj said he had misheard a radio broadcast and believed the tornado was going to hit at 2am, rather than 2pm.

'He thought he had plenty of time to make it home before anything happened,' Chicoj, who is originally from Guatemala, told the Oklahoman through an interpreter.

They continued to drive on Interstate 40 as the storm worsened. And after his wife unbuckled her seat belt so she could comfort the baby, they saw the storm head their way.

Victim: Their son, 17-day-old Rey Chicoj Pol, was also killed when the tornado threw their van into the air

Chicoj said he considered turning around but it was too late and, as the tornado rattled through, their car began to spin in the road before being swept into the air.

When the minivan landed, Chicoj awoke to hear his children crying but was devastated to see no sign of his wife or their youngest son.

He was able to escape the crushed vehicle. Another driver stopped to help him retrieve his children.

The three survivors were hospitalized. Tomasa suffered a broken leg and head trauma but they have all since been released.

Maria and baby Rey were found soon after, and an Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper said the baby was still alive - yet the child passed away in his arms before help arrived.

Devastation: Eight people were killed by the tornadoes and 11 people drowned in subsequent flooding

They both died from multiple blunt force head trauma, the medical examiner's office said.

Chicoj, who works at a hog farm in Hindon, said he has no plans to return to Guatemala as he believes his two surviving children will have a better life in Oklahoma.

Maria and Miguel were among the eight victims who lost their lives in the tornadoes on Friday; eleven more died from flooding afterwards.

Among the deaths were four storm chasers and a family of seven.

The tornado that struck El Reno on Friday night is believed to be the widest on record in the United States at 2.6 miles across, the National Weather Service reported on Tuesday.

Path: The young family were swept up in a massive tornado on Friday afternoon as they tried to get home

The May 31 twister beat the previous record, a 2.5-mile wide storm that struck Hallam, Nebraska, on May 22, 2004.

The National Weather Service on Tuesday announced that the twister that hit El Reno was a top-of-the-scale EF5 twister - the second to strike the area in less than two weeks.

Friday's tornado was initially rated as an EF3. But the agency upgraded that ranking after surveying damage and concluding that the storm had winds of 295 mph.
