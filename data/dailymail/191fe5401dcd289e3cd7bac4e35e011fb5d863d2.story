From his first appearance it was clear he was going to be a trendsetter.

The muslin swaddling cloth that his proud parents bought Prince George for his first public appearance sold out in less than four hours.

And it seems the youngest royal, who was tightly wrapped in the cloth when he left the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, has sparked a renewed interest in the age-old tradition of swaddling itself.

Trendsetter: George seemed to be tightly wrapped in his first official photo

It is not known if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have actually decided to swaddle their baby, or if they simply used the Aden + Anais cloth as a wrap.

Supporters believe swaddling a baby by wrapping the body, arms and legs in a thin cloth can help to calm a child and help it sleep.

Divided opinion: Some healthcare professionals advise against swaddling, while others recommend it

But medical studies have suggested a link between swaddling and an increased risk of cot death, hip development problems and posture issues.

Now mothers who were inspired to swaddle their babies after seeing Prince George in his wrap say that they have been faced with conflicting advice.

Grandmother Valerie Bachelor, from Okehampton, Devon, said her daughter was told swaddling could put her baby’s life at risk. ‘My daughter swaddles her baby (also George, born a week before the royal baby) as he seems to sleep better this way,’ she said.

‘Last week, on a visit to her local clinic, she was sternly told off for doing so as it is against guidelines.

‘My daughter now has a note on her file saying that she is swaddling her baby against professional advice and is willing to put her baby’s life at risk by doing so.’

She added: ‘What should she do – follow the advice of health professionals or the example of royalty?’

Mothers on parenting websites also said they had been told not to swaddle by health visitors and nurses – who warned them that their babies’ development would suffer if they were wrapped up.

Some said they had been told that official guidance now said babies should not be swaddled.

But a Department of Health spokesman confirmed that there have been no national guidelines issued about swaddling.

One exasperated mother wrote: ‘This is so confusing. Do we or don’t we? The changing guidelines make me quite anxious sometimes.’

Rosemary Dodds, from the National Childbirth Trust, said: ‘It is not straightforward, there is evidence for and against swaddling.

‘Some health professionals prefer to give clear instructions and tell parents not to swaddle because that seems like the simplest option in the light of the evidence.’

A baby's nursery is now the most expensive bedroom in the house to decorate and furnish – costing £3,825, according to a survey.

The study found that the average cost of preparing a room for a newborn has more than doubled in only a generation.

Parents now insist on buying their baby matching furniture and accessories, worth £1,473.

Clothes and electrical equipment, such as baby monitors and even TVs, also add to the cost.

The poll, by retailer Littlewoods.com, found that only the kitchen and the living room cost more to furnish – at £5,919 and £5,418 respectively.

New mother Lucy Brown, from Brighton, said: ‘Shopping for baby goods and clothes is addictive. It’s easy to get carried away in all the excitement of the birth.’
