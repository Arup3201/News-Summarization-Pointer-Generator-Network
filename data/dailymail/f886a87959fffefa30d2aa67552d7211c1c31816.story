On trial: Publicist Max Clifford outside Southwark Crown Court today

Max Clifford played a ‘tickling game’ with a 12-year-old girl before sexually abusing her in a Jacuzzi, a court heard yesterday.

He had invited the girl to join him and his daughter Louise in the Jacuzzi during a holiday in Spain in 1983, it was alleged.

The woman, now 43, said she was staying at a villa with her parents and had made friends with Louise, who was about the same age, around the communal swimming pool.

She told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that Clifford ‘liked to play a tickling game with me’. She said: ‘He would play it in the swimming pool. He would just tickle me and ask where I was ticklish, like people do with a child. I didn’t think much of it.

‘Then he would ask me to tickle him and he would say, “Guess where I am ticklish”, and I would guess the obvious – like the armpit – but I never got it right.’

She said on the final day of the holiday she and Louise and Clifford went to the Jacuzzi together, but that at first she was alone in the pool with Clifford.

The woman said: ‘He started asking me again if I wanted to know where he was ticklish, and I said yes. He then started touching me. He put his hand down my bikini bottoms and asked me if I was ticklish there.

'I knew it was wrong': The court heard one alleged victim claim she was abused by Clifford while on holiday in Spain in August 1983. The woman, who was 12 years old at the time, told the court she was in a jacuzzi with the media mogul when he forced her hand down his swimming trunks and made her masturbate him. She told the court she 'knew it was wrong'

‘I said, “No, no, I’m not ticklish 
there”.’ Then she said Clifford gripped her hand and forced it on to 
him, under the water, for several minutes. She added: ‘I was shocked. I 
was scared. He just smiled.’

She told the court that Clifford only released her when his daughter returned.

As
 they walked back to their villa later, she told Louise where her father
 had made her touch him. ‘She told me not to be so silly,’ said the 
woman.

She did not tell her 
parents at the time or for years afterwards, because ‘they might blame 
themselves and I didn’t want to put that on them’.

Richard
 Howell QC, defending, suggested the woman’s account was ‘quite false’. 
He said Louise had suffered from severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a
 condition that would have made it ‘extremely difficult’ for her to walk
 and get in and out of a Jacuzzi.

his Puerto Banus apartment in Spain, and right in his younger years,

The
 woman replied: ‘I don’t remember the fine detail. I remember what has 
given me nightmares for 30 years. I have not made this up. I didn’t want
 to be here today.’

Earlier
 the court heard Clifford sexually assaulted a teenager while on the 
phone to his wife, then promised to make her a Bond girl.

The
 blonde former model said she had gone to see the PR guru in 1983 
because she wanted to get into fashion. But once in his Bond Street 
office, she claimed Clifford locked the door and boasted of sleeping 
with singer Diana Ross. He made the 17-year-old remove her dress and 
began fondling her chest, saying he was ‘turned on’ by the ladders in 
her tights.

Then he took a 
phone call from his wife and at the same time exposed himself before 
forcing her to perform a sex act on him, she claimed.

Afterwards,
 he offered to introduce her to James Bond director Cubby Broccoli over 
dinner, but in return she would have to give Clifford sexual favours 
under the table while he sat next to his wife, it was alleged.

Clifford, 70, of Hersham, Surrey, denies 11 counts of indecent assault on teenagers aged  14 to 19 between 1966 and 1984.

The trial continues.

Jurors at the trial of PR Max Clifford, 70, were sent out by the judge today after they started giggling during a discussion about the size of his penis

The
 Max Clifford jurors were sent away and warned to 'settle down' by the 
judge today after some of them were overcome with giggles during a 
discussion about the publicist's 'small willy'.

A
 former model had been telling Southwark Crown Court she had thought 
Clifford was 'well-endowed', but added: 'I have a small mouth. I do, my 
dentist has always said...'

As a blonde female juror burst into laughter, Judge Anthony Leonard said: 'Whoa whoa...we are going to have a short break.'

After the jury filed out, hoots of laughter could be heard from behind the closed door.

When they returned, the judge said: ‘Members of the jury, it is inevitable in a case dealing with this sort of graphic detail that there will be times when members of the jury want to burst into laughter... but we have got to remember that this is a court of law and we are considering serious allegations.

'Can I ask you to settle down?'

The jury disruption happened after the court was told that Clifford, 70, groped a teenage model who went to him for career advice in 1983.

The
 woman, one of seven alleged victims of indecent assault by Clifford, 
told the court that she was advised to go to see him when she was about 
17.

Clifford
 told her how important he was to the press, that he made people’s 
careers, and that he had had sex with Diana Ross, she said.

'For me, Diana Ross was a very beautiful, famous woman, I couldn’t imagine why she would sleep with him,' she said.

Clifford told her that she needed to get some publicity, and it was very important she was seen with the right person.

She said: 'I thought, this is not what I
 want to be involved in, I couldn’t think of anything worse than being 
in the papers, or being on TV - I wanted to be a fashion model.'

Defendant: A former teenage model told the jury that Clifford boasted to her that he had slept with Diana Ross

He said he wanted to 
see her figure and told her to take her dress off, which she did 
reluctantly, partly because she was wearing a thermal vest and holey 
tights, as she was 'poverty stricken' and had only one pair.

'I hadn’t gone there thinking "I’m going to see a photographer", I thought I was going to get career advice.'

She
 took her dress off and Clifford was 'overcome', she said, adding: 'It 
was the tights, he was absolutely riveted about the tights.'

She
 said he groped her chest area and arms and added: 'At this point I’m 
feeling utterly stupid, totally in shock, I’m just not doing anything.'

Then
 the telephone rang, and it was his wife, the court heard. He motioned 
to the teenager to sit down, and she put the dress back on.

She said he then performed a sex act on himself while on the phone to his wife.

Courthouse: The jurors at Southwark Crown Court were asked to 'settle down' by Judge Anthony Leonard

She said she thought 
Clifford was well-endowed, but when questioned over the issue because 
the court had already heard claims that his penis was 'tiny', said she 
had only seen one penis before, and not at such close proximity.

Order: Judge Anthony Leonard sent the jury out, telling them to 'settle down'

The
 witness, who is now 48, said Clifford told her he wanted her to come to
 dinner with him and his wife and film producer Cubby Broccoli, saying 
that if she slept with Broccoli, she would get a part in a Bond film.

She
 told jurors she went back to the hotel where she was staying, and 
stayed in bed for a number of days, telling staff not to put Clifford’s 
calls through as he rang 'relentlessly'.

The
 woman said she told her sister and some friends what had happened, but 
rang police years later when she saw that Clifford had been arrested.

Later,
 the court was told by Clifford's defence barrister, Richard Horwell QC,
 that the media mogul had never claimed he had slept with Diana Ross.

The woman replied: 'He absolutely did, you don't forget that.'

Pressing
 the point, Mr Horwell said: 'I suggest that's complete fantasy', to 
which the women retorted: 'No, it absolutely isn't.'

And
 he said it was 'absurd and an invention' to say that Clifford had told 
the then-teenager she would have to sleep with Cubby Broccoli to get a 
part in a James Bond film.

Clifford,
 from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault 
against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges.
