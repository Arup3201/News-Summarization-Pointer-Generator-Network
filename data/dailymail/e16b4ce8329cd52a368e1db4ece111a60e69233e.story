Swamped by marriage offers: Gigi Chao has received numerous proposals since her father made his offer

A lesbian whose billionaire father offered £40million to any man who could turn her straight has claimed he is determined to make her ‘live in the closet’.

Property and shipping tycoon Cecil Chao offered the ‘marriage bounty’ after his daughter Gigi announced that she had married her female partner in France.

But in a forthright response Miss Chao, 33, claims her 76-year-old playboy father is only concerned with the impact her sexuality will have on her place in Hong Kong society.

She said she and her 45-year-old partner Sean Eav have been ‘overwhelmed’ by the deluge of emails proposing marriage and 1,500 Facebook friend requests in just a few days.

‘My father wants me to live in  the closet and marry a man to  promote my social status, and thinks marriage is a prestigious thing,’ she said.

‘Hong Kong is a long way from even talking about legalising gay marriage, but we need to change first social perceptions so the word “gay” doesn’t immediately cause blushing and embarrassment.’

She also told how she had been discreet about her sexuality to  protect her father, a well-known figure in Hong Kong high society, and was uncomfortable with the sudden global attention. She said: ‘Due to my parent’s high public profile, I don’t flaunt [my sexuality]. And that’s a very Chinese cultural way of life.

‘We accept people in the closet.  In Europe, one could say to be  gay is cool, but in Asia we’re far from that.

In denial: Hong Kong billionaire Mr Chao, who claims to have slept with 10,000 women, has refused to accept that his daughter is gay

‘I’m a private person. I hadn’t 
envisaged us becoming the face of gay Hong Kong but to change public 
perception one has to be honest and live with integrity.’ Although Miss 
Chao has been discreet about her relationships, her father has  
previously boasted about sleeping with 10,000 women.

She said: ‘We laugh about it. He’s 
really happy that he’s slept with 10,000 women. I mean, he definitely 
sees it as a good thing.’

The Manchester University  graduate 
met marketing manager Miss Eav through her work as an executive director
for her father’s property company.

She also has her own luxury goods, 
PR and marketing company, Haut Mond Talent.

And she revealed she had 
dated men in the past: ‘I’ve had boyfriends but never labelled myself as
gay or straight. I’m true to my heart as to what I found attractive. At
the moment, I’m sure I’m gay but it’s a personal experience.’

five months ago

Miss Chao, who regularly appears in Tatler Asia, now hopes that her life will return to normal as soon as possible.

‘Even my friend from  Denmark has read
the news. I am secretly praying for a blackout so I can get some peace 
and quiet.’ Since Mr Chao made his £40million offer he has received more
than 200 proposals from men as far afield as Oklahoma, Bulgaria, Turkey
and India.

Mr Chao has said of his potential 
son-in-law: ‘I don’t mind whether he is rich or poor – the important 
thing that is he is generous and good-hearted.

‘Gigi is a very good woman with both talents and looks. She is devoted to her parents, is generous and does volunteer work.’
