Arrested: Jesus Leonel Sanchez Meza was taken into custody on Thursday

One of the men suspected of murdering U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry has been arrested in Mexico.

The agent's death kicked off a national scandal into Operation Fast and Furious, a government programme which allowed gun smugglers to keep their weapons.

Jesus Leonel Sanchez Meza, who was arrested on Thursday in Sonora state, is one of the five men charged with killing Mr Terry in December 2010 during a shootout in Arizona near the Mexico border.

One of the men is on trial in Arizona and the other three remain fugitives.

Two guns found at the scene were 
bought by a member of a gun-smuggling ring that was being monitored in 
the Fast and Furious investigation.

Critics
 have attacked U.S. federal authorities for allowing informants to walk 
away from Arizona gun shops with weapons, rather than immediately 
arresting suspects.

In Operation Fast and Furious and at least three earlier probes during the administration of George W. Bush, agents in Arizona employed a risky tactic called gun-walking - allowing low-level 'straw' buyers in gun-trafficking networks to leave with loads of weapons purchased at gun shops.

The goal was to track the guns to major weapons traffickers and drug cartels in order to bring cases against kingpins who had long eluded prosecution under the former strategy of arresting low-level purchasers of guns who were suspected of buying them for others.

Victim: Federal agent Brian Terry was killed in a border shoot-out in 2010

During
 Operation Fast and Furious, many of the weapons were not tracked and 
wound up at crime scenes in Mexico and the U.S., including the Terry 
shooting.

In July, U.S.
 authorities made a rare disclosure linked to the botched gun-smuggling 
probe, revealing identities and requesting the public's help in 
capturing the four fugitives accused over Mr Terry's death.

The
 release of the suspects' identities in an unsealed indictment came with
 the offer of a $1million reward for information leading to their 
capture.

The FBI said 
it was seeking information related to Jesus Rosario Favela-Astorga, 31, 
Ivan Soto-Barraza, 34, Heraclio Osorio-Arellanes, 34, and a man 
identified as Lionel Portillo-Meza, which Mexican police said was an 
alias of the man arrested on Thursday in Puerto Penasco.

Charges: Three suspects in the killing are still on the loose

Accusation: Attorney General Eric Holder has been repeatedly criticised by Republicans for his role in Operation Fast and Furious

Authorities had previously released the identity of the fifth suspect, Manuel Osorio-Arellanes of El Fuerte in the Mexican state of Sinaloa. He was shot during the gunfight and has been in custody since the night of the shooting.

Osorio-Arellanes has pleaded not guilty in the case, telling investigators that he raised his weapon toward the agents during the shootout but didn't fire, the FBI said in records.

All five men have been charged with murder. They also face charges of assaulting four federal agents.

FBI agents declined to discuss which fugitive is suspected of firing the shot that killed Terry. They also would not comment on whether the weapon was linked to an Operation Fast and Furious purchase.

The five men, plus another who faces lesser charges in the case, went to the U.S. from Mexico in order to rob marijuana smugglers, according to the indictment.
