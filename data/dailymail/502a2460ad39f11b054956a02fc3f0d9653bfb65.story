A Second World War veteran has been reunited with the Spitfire he flew on his final mission nearly seventy years ago.

Lieutenant Rolf Kolling, now 91, returned to North Weald Airfield in Essex last Friday to catch another glimpse of the Mark IX Spitfire.

He was joined by wingman and compatriot Eigel Stigset at the home of 332 Squadron, where celebrations were taking place this weekend to mark the 70th anniversary of the wartime links between North Weald and Norway.

The pair are the two surviving veterans of the last combat mission flown by the RAF's Norwegian wing in the Second World War.

As they and five other veterans, their families, and senior serving Norwegian officers arrived at the airfield, near Epping, they were warmly greeted by an honour guard of veterans bearing RAF Association standards and local schoolchildren waving Norwegian flags.

Returning to the base, where Norwegian pilots arrived from 1942, brought back bittersweet memories for Kolling, who in his combat career of 120 
sorties was credited with one confirmed kill and a 
share in one probable.

The son of a railway engineer, Kolling joined
Norwayâ€™s merchant marine at the age of 18, just before the outbreak of war in September 1939.

In 1941, a year after Norway fell to the Nazis, he jumped ship in Melbourne, Australia, and headed to Canada, where Norwegians were being trained as pilots.

Before long, Kolling was serving with the RAF's 332 Squadron and flew alongside Stigset in Spitfire ML407.

Their last mission came on April 21, 1945, during which the pair took out a large German armoured patrol vehicle while flying at just 500ft and about 400 miles per hour.

They returned to Schijndel, their temporary Dutch base, and the next day were taken out of the front line. By the next month, they had returned to liberated Norway.

In total, the two Norwegian squadrons based at North Weald shot down 180 enemy aircraft while losing 72 pilots.

In an interview with The Telegraph, Kolling said: 'Four Spitfires would go up. And none would come back. Two pilots would be dead. Two 
would be prisoners of war. Every time you got into the cockpit, you knew it could be your last flight.'

He added: 'Even now I think about those times. Every night.
Before I left home, I told myself that this would be the last time I 
came back to North Weald. I am very, very glad I came here.'

A slab of rock from the mountains of Norway will be installed at the airfield to commemorate their bravery.

After the war, the grandfather, who now lives in Lysaker, near Oslo, served as a commercial pilot.

Meanwhile Spitfire ML407 was converted into a two-seater by the Irish Air Corps and was used as a training aircraft until 1960.

It was bought by Nick Grace, a design engineer and amateur pilot in 1979, who restored it to flying condition before his death in 1988.

His son, Richard, 28, flew ML407 from its base in Suffolk to North Weald for the poignant reunion.

Later on, the veterans looked on with nostalgia, as the plane performed two low level passes on the runway before finishing with a victory roll.

Major General Finn Hannestad, the head of the Royal Norwegian Air Force, said: 'It is an absolute privilege to be able 
to bring him and veterans like him back to North Weald, to where they 
started everything, to our roots as an air force.'
