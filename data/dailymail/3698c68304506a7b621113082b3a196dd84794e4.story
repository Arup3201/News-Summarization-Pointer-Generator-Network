Adam Johnson has been suspended by Sunderland after his arrest on suspicion of having sex with a 15-year-old girl.

The 27-year-old former England winger, who earns £50,000 a week, was arrested by Durham police at his £1.85million mansion on Monday morning and later bailed.

Sunderland have confirmed that Johnson, who recently became a father, will not be available for selection pending the outcome of the investigation, beginning with Tuesday’s Premier League clash at Hull. The Black Cats signed the Sunderland-born midfielder for £10m from Manchester City in 2012.

Johnson was released on bail on Monday night and will continue to help police with their inquiries 

He has scored 20 times in 105 games for the club, including the winner at Newcastle in this season’s Tyne-Wear derby.

However, he has struggled to rediscover the form which won him an England call-up in 2010. His last cap for the Three Lions came three years ago. Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough before joining City in 2010, where he won a Premier League title and the FA Cup.

The FA refused to comment on the arrest of the winger who has represented his country 12 times, although he failed to make the squad for the World Cup in Brazil last year.

Johnson gained a reputation as a keen party-goer when he played for Manchester City five years ago. At the time, he was renting Cristiano Ronaldo’s former house near Alderley Edge and would often be seen in the village socialising with fellow players and women. ‘He liked the attention of being a well-known footballer and attracting women was not a problem,’ said one local, who did not wish to be named. ‘He would often leave his car in the village after a night out as he liked a drink and would always get a taxi home.’

But three years ago, after returning to his native North East, Johnson began dating Stacey Flounders. Miss Flounders recently posted photographs of the couple’s first child, Ayla Sofia, who was born on January 8. It was unclear if she and her daughter were at home at the time of the player’s arrest. 

And speaking from Miss Flounders' family home, her mother told the Daily Mirror that her daughter and Johnson were still 'very close' and 'absolutely still together'.

She added: 'He is 100 per cent innocent and we will stand by him.

'He hasn't been found guilty of anything. He is a great lad and has not done anything wrong. This is a horrible situtation.'

Friends say Johnson opted to live near the quiet hamlet of Castle Eden to get away from the ‘bright lights’ of city life.

Three unmarked police cars, a police van, several plain-clothed officers and a forensics team were seen at his house as he was questioned at a Durham police station.

Johnson’s stunning gated property boasts six bedrooms and a sweeping gravel drive and is set in more than two acres of mature woodland. The house is a typical Footballers’ Wives-style property with Italian stone flooring, and a spiral staircase to a mezzanine level. The master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom, dressing room and balconies at the front and rear while the other five bedrooms are all en-suite.

It is unclear where the alleged assault is said to have taken place and police would not release any further details.

Johnson was born in Sunderland and raised in Easington, County Durham, before joining Middlesbrough’s youth academy as a 12-year-old. After making his Premier League debut for Middlesbrough in 2005 he was sold in February 2010 to Manchester City before being signed three years ago by Sunderland.

On Monday night a Durham Police spokesman said: ‘A 27-year-old man was arrested earlier today on suspicion of sexual activity with a girl under 16. He has been released on police bail pending on-going investigations.

‘A blank firing pistol, which replicates the sound of real gunshots but does not require a licence to own, was also recovered during a search of the property.’

Former Middlesbrough star: Adam Johnson has represented England  at senior level 12 times

Adam Johnson began his career at Middlesbrough, where he made his debut in a Uefa Cup game in 2005, aged just 17.

Almost six months later, he turned out for the first time in the Premier League, taking part in a 2-1 home win against Arsenal.

He was loaned out to Leeds United then Watford, scoring 12 goals in his three-month stay at the Hertfordshire club.

On his return to Middlesbrough, he again showed strong form, then made a £7million move to Manchester City in February 2010.

In three seasons at the Etihad Stadium, the speedy winger made 97 appearances, helping win the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Community Shield.

In August 2012 he moved back to his native North East, to Sunderland, in a £10million deal, and highlights of his time there have included a hat-trick on January 11 last year in a 4-1 away win over Fulham.

He said after taking the match ball as a memento: ‘These days don't come along too often unless you're Messi or Ronaldo, so it was nice for me to get that ball as a souvenir to look back on.

‘This is up there with one of my best days of my career along with playing for England, scoring for England.’

He was awarded the Barclays Player of the Month award that month.

The 27-year-old has represented England at under-19 and under-21 level, and at senior level 12 times, the last of them in a friendly victory over Italy in August 2012.

He has struggled to reproduce his best form on a sustained basis at Sunderland, but endeared himself to the fans with goals in each of the club's three derby victories at Newcastle in as many seasons, including a late winner at St James' Park on December 21 last year.
