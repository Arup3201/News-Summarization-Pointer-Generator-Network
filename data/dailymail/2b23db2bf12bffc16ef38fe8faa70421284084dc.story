A reclusive Missouri man shot dead four relatives and three neighbors in a nighttime rampage after he found his elderly mother dead on her couch, police claim.

Joseph Aldridge, 36, allegedly opened fire in four separate locations on Thursday night after his 74-year-old mother Alice, who had been ill, died  at home in Tyrone, Texas County. 

Nine people are dead in the tiny rural community - including Aldridge, who turned the gun on himself after the shooting spree. 

The alarm was first raised around 10.15pm by a 15-year-old girl wearing nothing but a nightgown who ran barefoot to her neighbor's house through the snow when her parents Garold Aldridge, 52, and Julie Aldridge, 47, were shot.

'She said she seen a man in her dad's bedroom, talking to him in a normal voice. Then she said she heard gunshots and screaming,' an unidentified neighbor said.

The shooter (pictured in high school) is suspected of killing Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48

Joseph Aldridge, 36, was found dead in his pickup truck in the middle of the highway after shooting seven people dead in rural Missouri. He was described as a recluse by those in town who knew of him

'She was barefoot, in a nightgown with no sleeves at all and her legs were all scratched up from briars, he told the Springfield News Leader. 

Armed with a .45-caliber handgun, Aldridge shot two male cousins, their wives, and three neighbors before killing himself in his pickup truck on the outskirts of Summersville, Missouri, to the east of Texas County, police say.

Authorities identified four of the victims as Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, his wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and his wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. 

The shooter was a cousin to the male victims Garold and Harold.

His uncle Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between them 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to Arkansas Online.   

Around town, Aldridge was described as a recluse, and it was unclear what, if anything, he did for a living.

Vernetta Lucille Swartz, 76, Joseph Aldridge's aunt, now lives California and said was grief-stricken.

'Two of my nephews and wives were shot, and I guess another nephew was the shooter,' she said.

The teenage girl had heard her father talking to a man in a normal voice before screaming and a gunshot made her flee for her life 

Police first heard of the incident after the young girl contacted police at around  10:15pm on Thursday evening

Local media identified the other three victims as Darrell Shriver and Shriver's son and daughter-in-law, Carey and Valerie Shriver.

Shriver's wife Martha was wounded and hospitalized with serious but stable injuries. His grandson had hidden in another room and is staying with relatives while his mother is treated. She is expected to survive.

'Everybody is kind of just dazed, I'd guess you'd say,' their cousin John W Shriver, 72, said.

The elder Shriver discovered the bodies Carey and Valerie after getting a call from Martha around 10.30pm but couldn't immediately find their 13-year-old child, according to the Kansas City Star.

The boy, who hadn't woken up, was later found in his bed and taken in by his relative. 

He said that Aldridge 'didn't have much to do with people' and 'kind of stayed to himself'.

A neighbor told Daily Mail Online that everyone in the small towns of Tyrone and Summersville are aware of each other, and that Aldridge 'probably killed 10 per cent of the town's population last night'.  

John Shriver, 72, is a relative of the Shriver victims, two of whom he found dead on the floor of their bedroom after being called by Martha Shriver, who was wounded but expected

The shootings occurred within three miles of each other near Tyrone, a small town in Texas County, Missouri. Some of the victims were Joseph Aldridge's cousins

Sheriff James Sigman (pictured) identified four victims and a woman who died of natural causes as related to Aldridge, but did not identify three victims, believed to be the Shrivers

He said that there had been an ongoing feud between the suspected shooter's family and some of the victims.

Tyrone is estimated to have around 50 residents. 

All victims lived within a three mile radius of each other. 

Alice L. Aldridge, 74, the suspect's mother, 'died of natural causes' on the couch and is thought to have been dead for more than 24 hours before being found Thursday night.

The woman, who Aldridge lived with, died of a heart attack, the Summersville man said.

Police discovered her while looking for her son. 

Her death may have sparked the suspect to go on his rampage, Texas County Coroner Tom Whittaker told the St Louis Post-Dispatch.

Alice's brother Doyle Lay, 70, of Tyrone, said that tension between Joseph Aldridge and his cousins 'had been brewing like this for a year, year and a half,' according to Arkansas Online. 

Joseph Aldridge has a previous criminal history that includes being sentenced to 21 months in federal prison for possessing a handgun while being a marijuana user. He was released in 2010.

The shooter later died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his GMC pickup, which was in the middle of highway WW early Friday morning.

He did not leave a note. 

Troopers began an investigation in the area following the shootings. A resident reported that authorities were knocking on doors at 3.45am on Friday.

The state-wide Missouri State Highway Patrol is assisting the small town in the investigation. 

Authorities did not release a suspected motive for the killings and are not looking for any other suspects. 

'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents' the superintendent of nearby Houston's school district said

Staff of the Houston's school district were told to arrive early for counseling, according to the Houston Herald.

Superintendent Scott Dill said that residents of the close-knit community are in a 'state of shock' and he has been trying to help kids come to grips with the situation.

Children related to victims were not in school on Friday. 

'This is a bucolic area, one of the reasons people move here is to avoid these kind of incidents,' he told Daily Mail Online. 

Texas County, Missouri is an Ozark region of about 25,000 people located east of college town Springfield and south of Army base Fort Leonard Wood.

Tyrone is located in the southern portion of the county, south of Houston, the county seat, which has about 2,000 residents.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon said that the shootings were 'a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families.'

Department of Mental Health in the state have also made contact with local authorities to provide crisis intervention services and counseling.  

Autopsies will be performed over the weekend. 

Mr Whittaker said that the county averages about one homicide a year, many years having none.
