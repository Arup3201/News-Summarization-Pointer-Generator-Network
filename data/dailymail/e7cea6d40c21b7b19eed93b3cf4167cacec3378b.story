She's the heir to the Formula 1 empire and judging by her father's fortunes, it comes as little surprise that Tamara Ecclestone lives a life of privilege and unparalleled luxury.  

But, proving that she's just like the rest of us, the 30-year-old revealed that even she feels 'scruffy' on her down days. 

The glamorous star, who seemingly never has a hair out of place, told MailOnline: 'I like to look good when I go out but I look like a scruffy homeless person in the day! I'm either very casual or glam.'

The main reason for her laidback approach to styling is her new role as a mother - and it's clear that her daughter Sophia is her number one priority.

'I'm obsessed with Sophia and she is such a good baby that she can come everywhere with me,' Tamara said.

Polished Tamara is even taking a more relaxed approach to her beauty regime now that she's a mother - and doesn't even wear make-up on her off days.

She said: 'Since becoming a mother, I can get ready in 45 minutes and I'm a pro at fishtail plaits now because Sophia is such a hair destroyer.

'I hate having a full face of make-up when I'm kissing Sophia. After a shoot, I take it all off with a face wipe so I can kiss her.'

Despite showcasing an enviably toned physique in recent months, Tamara has been so focused on little Sophia that she maintains she hasn't worked out since March.

'I haven't done any exercise since giving birth. I walk her in her pram around the park but other than that, I've done none,' she said.

She does, however, plan on taking up more exercise next year. 'December is all about eating because it's cold and Christmassy but I will get back into my healthy regime in January; life is too short to say no to everything,' she said.

'It's my New Year's resolution to start pilates because my back is so stiff from carrying Sophia.' 

Tamara's first and foremost priority is her daughter Sophia, who she had in March with husband Jay Rutland

Next year is certainly looking bright for Tamara, who cites Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot as her beauty icons. 

The entrepreneur founded her hair care range, Show Beauty, 18 months ago - and it's already going global.

Show Beauty is set to expand  by adding a chain of blow-dry bars - Show Dry - across the UK, America, Canada, Ireland and United Arab Emirates.

The new mother has been working on the salons for 12 months and says they take cues from the luxurious feel of sumptuous interiors, the service of sleek designer boutiques and exclusivity of private members clubs for a 'truly integrated experience.'

She's been travelling across the globe (with Sophia in tow, of course) to launch her new blow-dry bars, which she promises give you that glossy, bouncy Tamara look in just 30 minutes.

The socialite has taken every last detail into consideration, and for someone with a taste for the finer things in life, you can expect iPads, flexible opening hours, valet parking, exclusive loyalty programmes, a healthy menu, and even a personal driver service to protect newly styled hair.

Despite the swanky surroundings, getting your hair styled a la Tamara will only set you back between £18-£45.

Tamara and her team have plans to introduce further concessions across the UK, including the full Harvey Nichols portfolio as well as Fenwicks and House of Fraser over the next twelve months. 

Speaking about her brand, she said: 'It's been crazy but it's all good. I've always been a beauty junkie and my mother was a model so I am obsessed with cosmetics. 

'I realised there were no luxury hair products out there so decided to make my own. I know what it's like being a mother and being in a hurry so I wanted to create something that was easy and accessible for every woman.'

While she's focusing on her blow-dry bars for now, Tamara is in talks to create a bodycare range and would love to venture into childrenswear. 'I'm obsessed with my daughter, so it would make sense,' she said.

Luxurious: Tamara launched Show Beauty last year and it includes dry shampoos and styling essentials, priced at around £35 per product
