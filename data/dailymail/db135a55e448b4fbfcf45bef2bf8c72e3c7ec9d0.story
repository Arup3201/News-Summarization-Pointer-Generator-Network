Romanian vagrants have set up home in the private gardens of one of London's most exclusive squares, it has been claimed.

Residents of Bryanston Square in Marylebone, say half a dozen of the migrants sneak into the picturesque gardens at night, leaving rubbish and human waste behind.

A gardener has said they have even left bottles of urine in a children's playground.

It comes just days after Romanian beggars returned to Park Lane, near Marble Arch, where they are now sleeping rough - fuelling concern of a repeat of last year's long running saga.

Residents of Bryanston Square in Marylebone, claim half a dozen of the migrants sneak into the gardens at night, leaving rubbish and human waste behind

Bryanston Square is one of London's most exclusive areas

A 40-strong group moved into the area ahead of last year's Olympics, turning the site into a rubbish dump. They were also accused of knife-point robberies and other crimes.

Now locals say a group of about five or six Romanians have been sleeping rough in Bryanston Square gardens for over a year, despite efforts by police to move them on.

A two bedroom flat in the area is currently on the market for £2million.

The picturesque garden is reserved for the affluent residents, yet late at night the gang scale the spiked fences to sleep.

A worker in the gardens, who did not want to give his name, said the group have made their home in there, bringing blankets and duvets to keep warm.

They then leave early in the morning or when police kick them out, often leaving behind two litre bottles filled with urine, he said.

He said: 'I have seen them here many times in the morning. They sleep at the end in the playground. It is usually the women here but sometimes they are with men.

'They sometimes leave behind their electric blankets and duvets.

'We throw them in the bin but they come and get them again.

'We have to pick up after them. It is mostly chocolate bar wrappers and cans of drink.'

It comes just days after Romanian beggars returned to Park Lane, near Marble Arch, where they are now sleeping rough

The group have taken over a patch of grass near Marble Arch and it is feared they may set up a camp

'We must clean up because there are young children coming to play there.'

A gardener, who also did not want to be named, said: 'We clean up the urine so they do not know they leave it here.

'Most people who live round here feel sorry for them because they are homeless.

'But this England we have the welfare system and salvation army. You cant just come to one of the richest parts of London and just set up camp.'

He said police regularly patrol the area, moving the gang on.

He said: 'They are around here a lot. One policemen said to me 'don't feel sorry for them, they are scum'.

'I do resent them. Firstly for what they leave behind for us to pick up but also because they don't work. I work hard for not much money, yet all they do is spend their time begging.'

One resident, living on Byranston Square, added: 'Yes it is a worry because who would want to move in around here with neighbours like that.

'Houses around here are extremely expensive so obviously if you have this sort of problem then it would put you off. I would not move here now.

'Will house prices go down? It is possible.'

The group store their equipment in doorways and in front of shops during the day

Another, who was playing with her daughter in the playground but didn't want to give her name, said: 'We do have a problem. The residents' association have had meetings about it and we are working with the police.

Jon Tann, who works as a security guard at a private residence on Byranston Square, said: 'They have been here for over a year. Police move them on but they just come back. 

'They started off sleeping in doorways up in roads nearby but recently they have been moving into the Gardens more often.'
