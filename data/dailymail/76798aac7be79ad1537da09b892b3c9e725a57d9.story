Extraordinary bugged calls between separatists that suggest flight MH17 was shot down by a Russian-made missile over Ukraine were revealed today by investigators.

The intercepted dialogue strongly suggests a Russian military crew was accompanying a BUK missile smuggled into eastern Ukraine shortly before the Boeing 777 was shot out the sky.

It also indicates the weapons system was smuggled back over the border to Russia afterwards.

The disclosures support an earlier MailOnline story highlighting the use of a Volvo truck to transport the BUK. 

The revelations came as the Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) probing the Malaysian Airlines crash called for witnesses 'who can tell more about the transport, crew and launch of a BUK rocket in the area in the days before and after the crash,' it said.

Their video appeal, carrying images of the BUK weapon system on a flatbed truck and audio recordings of the intercepted telephone conversations, was being aired on television and radio and distributed on websites and social media. 

Dutch prosecutors released a video appeal for witnesses in eastern Ukraine who may have seen a Russian-made BUK rocket (pictured, above, on a Volvo truck) being fired at Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, saying this was the 'leading scenario' in their  investigation into the disaster last year which killed 298 people on board

All 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines jet - the majority of them Dutch - died when it was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine last year.

The call for witnesses confirms that investigators are taking seriously the scenario that the Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky by a Russian-made BUK missile fired from an area of Donetsk region controlled by pro-Moscow separatists.

Moscow has strongly denied these allegations.  

Investigators say it is 'too early to draw conclusions on the disaster', but their appeal for witnesses could not be clearer.

It was coupled with the release of an intercepted phone call 'between two separatists on July 17th at 9.08am in which they have discussed the transportation of BUK to Donetsk. 

'Apparently, the conversation reveals that the BUK was accompanied by a crew'.

Investigators say it is 'too early to draw conclusions', but their appeal for witnesses could not be clearer

Intercepted phone calls also indicate the missile was smuggled back over the border to Russia afterwards

The appeal from the investigators stated:

'If you saw this transport in Donetsk or have any information regarding the crew members, or their uniform, please contact us. 

'From Donetsk the BUK was transported to Snizhne, passing through Makiivka, Zuhres and Torez.

'The JIT would like to speak with witnesses who have seen this transport or who might have other information that can help the investigation.

'Around midday, the BUK was seen in Snizhne, heading south. The BUK had been unloaded off the Volvo truck and was driving by itself.

'The JIT is looking for witnesses who saw the BUK and the crew on 17 July between 12.00 pm and 4.20 pm

'At 4.20 pm near Hrabove, the Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 crashed which was carrying 298 civilian passengers. 

'The JIT is looking for witnesses who have seen any of the following events including transport of the BUK, the launch of the BUK missile, the shooting down of the flight MH17 and those who can identify those who are responsible for this crime.

'Even small pieces of information could assist us in our investigation.'

Crash investigator survey the wreckage in July last year. All 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines jet - the majority of them Dutch - died when it was shot down over war-torn eastern Ukraine last year.

Another intercepted call between two separatists which took place on 17 July 2014 at 9.32 pm indicated that the BUK is located at a checkpoint where it was expected and one of the crew members has been left behind.

The transcript reads:

A - yes!

B - hello, commander. Have you already left, yes?

A - me? yes, I have left for my task, you - for yours.

B - I got it. are you within that very region or not?

A - no, I am not within that region. I am to the other direction.

B - (inaudible) - a fighter has got lost there from this one... (inaudible) from this missile launcher... he has f***ed his crew.

A - what a launcher?

B - from BUK.

A - from BUK?

B - yes.

A - and where is he, f*** him?

B - here he is, standing at the checkpoint.

A - Take him and bring in here, f***. I'll be waiting for him in Snizhne near the petrol station.

B - good.

The investigators say 'from the conversation we can conclude that one crew member was forgotten at this checkpoint' and appeal for details of the location of the checkpoint or any information about the missing crew member.

'In the early morning of the 18th of July, around 5 am the Volvo truck transporting the BUK was seen in Lugansk heading in the direction of Krasnodon\Sjeverne. 

'Have you seen the transport of this BUK in the morning of July 18th? Please contact the JIT.

'We have recorded and analysed the following intercepted telephone call between two separatists which took place on 18 July at 8am. 

'It indicates that missile launching system BUK has left Ukraine and crossed the border to Russia.'
