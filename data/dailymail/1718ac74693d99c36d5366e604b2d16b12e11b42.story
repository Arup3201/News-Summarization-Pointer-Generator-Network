It is often said that the best times of our lives are when we are young.

Now, however, a survey suggests we are in fact happiest in our seventies – because after we reach retirement we rediscover the everyday joys of life.

Indeed, far from being grumpy old men and women, it seems Britain’s senior citizens are more content than those younger than them.

And the key to happiness, they say, is simple – good friends, good health and having the freedom to go shopping whenever you want.

More than one in three over-70s told researchers they considered themselves ‘very happy’, compared to only one in six of those aged 50 to 60.

The research revealed that the three most unexpected joys of retirement are regaining a social life, enjoying good health and not having to leave chores and arduous tasks until the weekend.

Some 36 per cent of those aged 71 to 80 said they lived life with a smile on their face, compared to only 16 per cent of 51- to 60-year-olds.

In addition, only 9 per cent of 70-somethings said they didn’t feel they had a meaningful role to play in their community, compared to 22 per cent of 50-somethings.

The findings emerged in a study carried out by Oddfellows, the 200-year-old ‘friendship group’ that holds social events and provides support for pensioners, to mark the start of its annual Friendship Month.

Jane Nelson, the society’s chief executive officer, said: ‘What our research shows is that it’s perfectly possible for life to begin at 50, 60 or even 70. They key is how positively you choose to use your time. If you approach retirement in the right way then you can become happier as you get older.’

She added: ‘Our study shows that the reality of retirement doesn’t necessarily meet expectations for a lot of people.

‘Many simply look forward to having a lot more time on their hands, but that can translate into loneliness, a lack of purpose and a longing for social interaction.

‘Above all, people often discover they miss the kind of camaraderie and everyday engagement that they took for granted in the course of their working lives.’

The study questioned nearly 1,000 over-50s to gauge their perceptions of retirement and their place within their communities and society. Nearly half – 45 per cent – of respondents in their fifties said spending time with friends was what they were most looking forward to about being retired.

Yet nearly two-thirds of participants aged in their seventies said they considered it the most enjoyable element. Having less stress was the aspect of retirement that was both most looked forward to and most enjoyed, selected by more than 60 per cent of those questioned overall.

The Oddfellows helps 280,000 members enjoy a social life, as well as providing care, advice and support. Throughout September its 146 branches will stage special events to ‘connect old and new friends’.

Professor Tarani Chandola of Manchester University, a leading expert on the links between work, stress, friendship and happiness, said yesterday: ‘There’s a wealth of research on how people with stressful jobs get a temporary boost in happiness upon retirement, but this boost isn’t sustained by everyone.

‘Older adults who remain socially active in community and voluntary organisations like the Oddfellows are the ones most likely to maintain their happiness in retirement.’

The findings are supported by a 2011 study of the health and well-being of pensioners since 1971, which found that not only are the over-70s happier, but also better educated and enjoying a more fulfilling sex life than their counterparts 30 years ago.

Professor Ingmar Skoog, who led the Swedish study at Gothenburg University, said: ‘This is the rock and roll generation born in the 1930s and 1940s now getting old and they are not going to be sitting on a park bench feeding the birds. Being 75 today is probably like being 55 was 30 years ago.’

Older people are smarter than ever too, according to intelligence test scores, due to better schooling.

Researchers suggested that many may be inspired by active and glamorous 70-somethings such as American actress Jane Fonda, 76, and designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, 73.
