President Obama said Tuesday that he has a 'businesslike' working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, but that the two men have virtually irreconcilable differences in their approaches to establishing a Palestinian state as a road to Middle East peace. 

'We believe that two states is the best path forward for Israel's security, for Palestinian aspirations, and for regional stability,' Obama said during an afternoon  joint press conference with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. 'That's our view, and that continues to be our view.'

Netanyahu, he said, 'has a different approach.'

'And so this can't be reduced to a matter of, somehow, "Let's all hold hands and sing Kumbaya",' the president told reporters in the East Room of the Whtie House.

'This is a matter of figuring out, "How do we get through a real knotty policy difference that has great consequences for both countries and for the region?"'

NO KUMBAYA: Obama said Netanyahu would likely kill off any chance for a two-state solution in the Middle East, and it couldn't be achieved simply by holding hands and 'singing' for peace

TENSIONS: Israeli security forces stand guard following clashes with Palestinian youths during protests against Jewish settlements in the West Bank

Netanyahu declared in the final days before last week's high-intensity elections that there would be no Paleestinian state as long as Israeli voters continued to give his Likud party enough seats in parliament to establish a governing majority and keep him as prime minister.

'I took him at his word, that that's what he meant,' Obama said, later saying of prospects for a two-state solution that 'that possibility seems very dim.'

'We'll continue to engage the Israeli government as well as the Palestinians,' he insisted, 'and ask them – Where are they interested in going? And how do they see this issue being resolved?'

'But what we can't do is pretend that there's a possibility of something that's not there. And we can't continue to premise our public diplomacy based on something that everybody knows is not going to happen, at least in the next several years.

Netanyahu had said in 2009 that he would be willing to endorse a 'demilitarized' Palestinian state as long as it recognized Israel's right to exist. But his pledge barely a week ago seemed to erase that option.

After the election, Netanyahu clarified his campaign promise about never allowing a Palestinian state to take root.

'I said that the conditions for that today are not achievable for a simple reason,' he said during a Fox News Channel interview. 'Mahmoud Abbas, the leader of the Palestinians, rejects consistently the acceptance of a Jewish State. He's made a pact with the Palestinian terrorist organization Hamas that calls for our destruction.'

'And the conditions in the Middle East has changed to the point where any territory you withdraw from is immediately taken out by Iranian backed terrorists or by ISIS.'

'Right now we have to get the Palestinians to go back to the negotiating table,' he added, 'break their pact with Hamas and accept the idea of a Jewish state.'

DISTRACTION: The president was in the East room with Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai to talk about a potential troop withdrawal, but talk of Israel occupied nearly 20 minutes of the press conference

'ASPIRATIONS' OF MAHMOUD ABBAS: While Palestinian-aligned terrorists call for the destruction of Israel, Obama aims to create conditions for the Palestinian Authority's peaceful coexistence with Israel

Obama declared on Tuesday that those conditions were unworkable. 

'He pointed out that he didn't say "never",' the president said of Netanyahu's apparent flip-flop. 'but that there would be a series of conditions in which a Palestinian state could potentially be created.'

'But of course the conditions were such that they would be impossible to meet any time soon.'

Obama brushed off a follow-up question from a reporter about whether his administration would try to force the issue through the United Nations Security Council, where the U.S. has for decades blocked measures designed to establish a Palestinian state despite Israel's objections.

He said he would wait until Netanyahu assembled his new coalition government before decidign whetehr to take action. 

Obama also took pains to clarify that any reassessment of U.S.-Israeli relations wouldn't have an impact on defense arrangements with Tel Aviv.

'Our military and intelligence cooperation with Israel will continue – unabated, unaffected – and we are absolutely committed to ensure that the Israeli people are safe,' he said, 'particularly from rocket attacks and terrorist attacks aimed on civilians.'
