Auction website eBay is on alert to stop people making a profit by re-selling poppies from the Tower of London installation.

The ceramic poppies created for the 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' art project have been so popular that all 888,246 of them have sold in advance for £25 each - raising money for armed forces charities in the process.

But it has emerged that some of the ceramic poppies are being sold online for profit.

One seller has listed two ceramic poppies on eBay for £49.99 and £65 - more than double the price.

The seller known as '2250leanne' said in the description: 'Please note delivery of this item is due late January, early February 2015'.

To add further insult the trader asked up £9.99 for postage - double the official website price.

Luckily website bosses spotted the dubious listings and removed them immediately. 

They have now put a system in place to automatically remove any such listings in the future.

An eBay spokesman said: 'We are not permitting resale of the limited edition Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red ceramic poppies on eBay. 

'Any listings attempting to sell these items will be cancelled before any sale takes place.

'Our marketplace is not an appropriate venue for the limited edition ceramic poppies in view of the significance of each individual poppy as a memorial to an individual British military fatality.'

He also said 'pre-sale' listings are not permitted on the site so the listings would have been removed in due course anyway.

Millions of people have flocked to see artist Paul Cummins' remarkable installation at the Tower of London to mark the centenary of Britain's involvement in the First World War.

There will be 888,246 in place by November 11.

The number represents each British military fatality during the Great War.

The poppies have been sold for £25 each, plus £5.95 for postage, and 10 per cent from each plus all net profits will be divided between six service charities; The Royal British Legion, SSAFA, Combat Stress, Help for Heroes, Coming Home and Cobseo.

The poppies first appeared in August and were sold out by October 17.

A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said: 'The Royal British Legion works closely with eBay and have a dedicated eBay shop selling official poppy products. 

'We urge all members of the public using eBay to buy their poppy items, to do so directly from our store.

'We strongly encourage anyone re-selling poppy items to donate to the Legion and advise buyers on eBay to look for the 'eBay for charity' ribbon which identifies listings where a percentage of the sale will be donated to charity.

'In this instance we are grateful that eBay have taken this decision to remove the listings and prevent people profiteering from charity campaigns.'

A Historic Royal Palaces spokesman said they have been in ongoing conversations with eBay to ensure the poppies are not sold on and they are also monitoring any other merchandise associated with the installation that appears on the marketplace website.

Historic Royal Palaces, which runs the Tower of London, has warned people on its website not to expect their poppies to be delivered until January or February next year due to the huge number they have to process. 

Work to make the 888,246 ceramic poppies started in August last year and involved 400 people manufacturing them using 400 tons of clay.

Some 25,000 people have volunteered to help install the poppies at the Tower of London.
