Penn State fans stood together today in support of the university's football team after a week full of sex abuse allegations and the surprising firing of head coach Joe Paterno.

The stadium was packed with 100,000 attendees, though the mood was not as lively as normal. The beleaguered team went on to lose against Nebraska, 17 to 14, even though they were ranked higher.

While they typically dress in all white, the crowd was dressed in blue as a sign of support for the victims of sexual assault by the team's former defensive line coordinator Jerry Sandusky.

Advocates for victims of sexual assualt called for a 'blue-out' at today's game, urging attendees to change their wardrobe from the typical 'white out' seen at home games.

Donations for two child-abuse prevention organizations were accepted at the stadium gates. Earlier fund-raisers raised more than $200,000 in the days leading up to the game.

'This has been one of the saddest weeks 
in the history of Penn State and my heart goes out to those who have 
been victimized. I share your anger and sorrow,' new school president 
Rod Erickson said in a video played in the first quarter. 'Although we 
can't go back to business as usual, our university must move forward. We
are a community.'

Saturday home games are a town-wide event in State College, Pennsylvania, and are normally the source of joy and excitement. That feeling was not present at today's game, as the sacking of Paterno left fans with heavy hearts.

'I love Penn State football, always will love Penn State football. Tough week, cried in my office a couple times when I had moments to myself,' said Dave Young, a longtime Penn State fan.

'But now it's time to release and watch the football game and enjoy it,' Mr Young continued.

Paterno is one of the most successful coaches in the history of college football, and has been lead Penn State's team for the past 46 years.

Showing support: Fans dress up like Joe Paterno and wear sweaters dedicated to him at Saturday's game

Angry: Many fans were upset at the sacking of the famed coach after he failed to properly handle the allegations of sex-abuse

He was fired Wednesday after reports surfaced that one of his former assistant coaches, Jerry Sandusky, had assaulted a number of young men while working on the team. Paterno reported the abuse to university higher-ups, but did not contact police, which is the crux of the university's decision against him.

Paterno initially said that he would retire at the end of the season, but university trustees then decided that he needed to be fired immediately.

Intense: Their actions reflected the heavy weight of tension surrounding Saturday's game

The move angered fans and students as the coach is seen as a legend.

'Having [Paterno] taken away from us made us feel lost,' said student Leah Blasko.

The team was lead by Tom Bradley on Saturday who had served as Paterno's assistant for the past 11 years.

'We are obviously in a very unprecedented situation,' Bradley said Thursday. 'I just have to find a way to restore the confidence and to start a healing process with everybody.'

Security: Police are on high alert at Beaver Stadium after an earlier bomb threat

Threat: The school sent out an emergency text to students Saturday morning confirming that there had been a bomb threat against the football stadium

Assistant coach Mike McQueary was put on administrative leave Friday after he had several threats made against him since speaking to a grand jury panel about Jerry Sandusky's activities with young boys.

The university president and two administrators were fired and the administrators were arrested in for perjury.

An unidentified caller tipped police off to a bomb threat against the famed Beaver Stadium Friday evening, but two sweeps by police and FBI forces were done and nothing was found, allowing Saturday's game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers to go on as scheduled.

True colors: Fans typically wear white at games, calling it a 'white out' but more blue was seen Saturday in support for the victims of sexual assault at the hands of one of the team's former coaches

Remembering: Fans of all ages paid tribute to the long career of the recently-fired coach

Missing: Saturday's game was the first in 46 years that Joe Paterno was not a part of

Pre-game events reflected the determined yet repentant mood of the university, with the entire stadium pausing for a moment of silence before the alma mater was sang.

When the team members- none of whom were actually involved in the scandal- the players were linked arm-in-arm, showing their level of commitment to the victims. Normally, they rush the field and wave on fans who are screaming in anticipation.

'It's heartbreaking and sad and almost surreal. You can't get it out of your head for more than a minute. I'm sure just about everyone here feels the same way,' said fan Emmie Fay.

'But we're here because we love the school and believe in it,' Ms Fay continued.

Legends: Coach Joe Paterno will not be leading the Penn State football team Saturday for the first time in 45 seasons

Fall: Paterno was fired by a school trustee due to his involvement in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal

A number of former players attended the game and watched on from the sidelines, rallying behind the team, but the most talked about presence was one that was lacking: Joe Paterno was nowhere to be seen.

Paterno's son Jay attended the game and cheered on fans, encouraging them to support the team.

'That's Joe Paterno's decision,' new Penn State president Rod Erickson said Friday when asked if he expected Paterno at the game. 'Clearly he's welcome to come, as any other member of the public would be.'

The
eight victims of sexual assault by former Penn State defensive line 
coach Jerry Sandusky will have to testify if the case goes to trial.

Legal experts say that while two of the eight men remain anonymous, they would have to testify in court.

That said, there is the thought that the case may not even make it into a courtroom.

'Ninety-four percent of state cases
plead out,' legal commentator Beth Karas told CBS News. 'So, yeah. 
Chances are it will, but a lot of cases still do go to trial, so it 
could.'

Sandusky has been charged with 40 
counts relating to sexual assault and many are expecting more victims to
be added as the case continues.

'This was a two-year investigation. There's no reason to believe these eight children are the only ones,' Ms Karas said. Â 

'Jerry Sandusky had his foundation 
since 1977. I believe the investigation will widen, and the net cast is 
very broad. I did speak with a spokesman for the attorney general's 
office, and he will not comment on further victims who are coming 
forward.

'Two of the eight are unidentified.
They're known as victims two and eight. No one is named in that grand 
jury report. But, yes, they will have to testify. That's very common,' 
Ms Karas continued.
