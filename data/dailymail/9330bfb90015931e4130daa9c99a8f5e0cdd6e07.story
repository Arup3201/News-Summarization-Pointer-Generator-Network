A seven-year-old boy has become the youngest child in Britain to gain the top grade in any GCSE exam after his mother snapped up a study aid book for 5p at a charity shop.

Thomas Barnes secured an A* grade in maths this summer to beat the previous record.

The home-schooled boy, from Leigh in Lancashire, was awarded the grade in maths after taking an exam with students more than twice his age.

Thomas, who lives at home with parents Angela and Simon and three-year-old sister Ellie, sat the paper at Westleigh High School in June.

He was overjoyed to receive his grade on results day last week.

Thomas was born on February 14 and beats the previous four-year-old record held by Oscar Selby from Surrey, who also secured the top grade in GCSE maths in 2010 at the age of seven.

Mr Barnes, 41, said: 'I am so proud of him. When I heard he was the youngest ever it made me cry and I shed a little tear for my late father. I had a blubber. he would have been so proud.'

But Oscar was born just a few days earlier in February which means Thomas is a few days older and now takes the title as the youngest ever pupil to gain a top grade.

Thomas has had a knack for numbers from a young age and shows potential in a number of other subjects. The youngster, who also loves science, now plans to study physics and chemistry.

His parents teach Thomas from home to ensure he is constantly challenged and doesn't get bored.

Mr Barnes added: 'We are very proud of Thomas, the future is bright for him. He has done this on his own, with only our help. He loves science and has a natural ability for maths.

'Other than that, he's a normal kid who plays video games. His grandmother gave him £20 as a reward. He spent it on a toy gun for himself and a toy puppy for his sister - he has a heart of gold.'

Mr Barnes said Thomas showed astonishing academic ability from an early age and an impressive thirst for knowledge.

He added: 'Thomas was reading quite early, at the age of three, and started writing when he was four. When he was five, his mum picked up a GCSE maths book from a charity shop and we put it aside for when he was older, but he couldn't get his head out of it.

'Some of it was really hard stuff, but he just wanted to learn more and more. We were surprised how much he picked up so quickly.

'We put him through a Key Stage 3 test and he got a level seven, which is high. We then knew the next step was a GCSE exam. He's naturally good with numbers and is very good at figuring things out in his head.

'It's hard keeping up with him. I'm an accountant by trade, so I'm quite good with numbers. Before the exam, I took the same practice paper as him and he beat me. We're delighted for Thomas. Hopefully this will open a few doors for him.'

Mr Barnes said they began teaching Thomas at home after taking him to a preschool when he was three.

'He could already read and do basic maths. We were trying to find out what they could teach him and they were saying they would teach him to read but we said he could already do that. We felt it was wasting time.

'At that stage we thought he is not going to learn anything apart from learn to play. But we took him to a lot of playgroups so he could learn to play there.

'When it was time for him to start primary school we were in the same situation as before. We visited 13 primary schools and spoke to many of the headteachers to explain our situation.

'It is hard when there is an exceptionally bright boy. If it were the opposite, say he was dyslexic, he would get some help. It sounds awful but if you are one of the brighter kids you get left alone. We felt the only way to find an education suited to his ability was for us to teach him ourselves.

'I felt in school he would not be getting the help he needs. I was teaching him basic addition and I could see him picking it up quickly.

the plan was for him to do a GCSE at 13, two more at 14, three at 15. To spread it out so it would be easier for him.

'We realised he was way ahead at maths when my shop went to Leigh and bought a GCSE maths book from the hospice charity shop for 5p. She brought it home and I started throwing sums at him and he was just taking everything in his stride. He was getting better and better. He just went through the whole book.

'We decided to see if we could put him in for his exam and in February we got confirmation he could sit the exam. before that he would study from 9am until lunchtime.

'From February we increased the teaching to full time so that he would begin, have a lunch break and carry on in the afternoon with a few more lunch breaks.

'We have not hot housed him. The idea of teaching him just happened because we thought he is not going to get stretched at school.

'Education is geared towards the kids below the target line. We just felt Thomas would not learn a lot and that he wouldn't get stretched.

'He has always dictated the pace of learning to us.'

Mr Barnes, an accountant, said Thomas decided he wanted to be a scientist when he grows up after watching a documentary about the Large Hadron Collider based near Geneva, Switzerland.

Mr Barnes added: 'He has loved science from a young age. When he was three he asked me why leaves are green and wanted to know all the reasons why they are that colour.

'But he always wanted to know more. He just has this thirst to understand the world. I enjoy teaching him.'

But his dream of being taught chemistry at home in under threat as his father is unable to buy the right equipment - as the youngster could be considered a terrorist threat.

Mr Barnes explained: 'You can't buy the chemicals you need. The companies that sell them will only do so to an educational institution because of fears someone might use the chemicals to make a bomb.

'You can get a basic chemistry set from Argos, but I can't get the equipment I need to teach him because of security fears after 9/11 and 7/7.'
