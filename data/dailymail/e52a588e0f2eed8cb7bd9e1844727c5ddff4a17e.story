A man has gone on trial accused of molesting a 13-year-old girl before going on to rape her daughter two decades later.

Lee Crutchley, 45, denies a string of 16 sex offences against five girls including indecent assault, sex with a girl under 13 and two charges of rape.

Crutchley is accused of indecently assaulting one of his victims in the mid 1990s when she was about 13, the court heard.

He is also accused of sexually assaulting and raping her daughter at a later date.

David Gordon, prosecuting at Sheffield Crown Court yesterday, said Crutchley, of Dinnington, South Yorkshire, took advantage of his victims' innocence and naivety.

He said Crutchley targeted his first victim when she was 13 and he was in his mid twenties.

Another of his victims was 12 or 13 when the alleged offences took place and she later fell pregnant but suffered a miscarriage, the court heard.

Mr Gordon told the court: 'He told her not to tell anyone what was going on. He had sex with her over a four-year period several times a week.'

Mr Gordon claimed Crutchley did not force himself on the girl but she was unable to consent because of her young age.

Crutchley denies eight counts of indecent assault, two of sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, three of assault by penetration, one of buggery and two of rape. The trial continues.
