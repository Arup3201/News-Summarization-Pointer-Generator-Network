A woman from Tippencanoe County in Indiana allegedly had been living with her husband's decomposing body for nine months before he was discovered dead and rotting in doorway of their home,

Tippecanoe County Coroner Donna Avolt said on Tuesday that 88-year-old veteran Gerald Francus Gavan Jr. died over nine months before his decomposing body was discovered on May 3.

Neighbors of the Lafayette veteran say his wife Ila Solomon acted as though Gavan was not dead and they were shocked to hear that a forensic entomologist would be testifying in court that Gavan's death occurred on July 15th or sometime before.

Neighbor Tom Vaughan told WLFI that Solomon was a nice woman, but she frequently told unbelievable stories and even claimed that Gavan was at the Kentucky Derby the day he was found dead

The Mail Online spoke with John Withers of the Lafayette Police Department who said that officers were sent to the home on a well-being call because a friend of Gavan had been trying to get in touch with him to invited him to his birthday party.

When the friend wasn't able to get a hold of Gavan he called the police who then discovered Gavan's rotting body.

'It's really disturbing,' said neighbor Tyler Imel to the Indy Star, 'the fact that we've been living here the whole time and talking to her.'

Imel's roommate Joe Childs said that Ila Solomon was 'friendly' and that she would leave her house on a regular basis.

'If I lived with a dead body in my house, I couldn't compose myself the way that she did every day,' said Childs.

Neighbor Tom Vaughan told WLFI that Solomon was a nice woman, but she frequently told unbelievable stories and even claimed that Gavan was at the Kentucky Derby the day he was found dead.

Solomon said on Tuesday that her husband was not dead for nine months and that he suffered a small stroke on April 28.

She said that the coroner was not right about the date of her husband's death and that the dry environment of her home in addition to a pest problem made it seem like he were dead for longer than he actually was.

Solomon says that her husband's body
 decomposed faster than usual because of flies, rodents, and 
dehumidifiers that her husband kept around for woodworking projects.

'I think that there is enough proof and evidence that that's not true,' Solomon said.

Solomon said that a pungent odor from her husband's body forced her to sleep in the house she owns next door during the five days she claims he was dead.

When asked why she didn't report his death to the authorities she said, 'I would love to answer," she said. 'I would love to tell you. I really, really would.'

She said that her husband wanted to follow a tradition he heard about in India in which human bodies are put on a hill for birds to eat. She said her husband wanted a , 'bird's eye view' of his death.

She said that she was planning on transporting his corpse to a 'body ranch' in Texas where researchers study vultures feeding on bodies.

'I love Scooter,' Solomon said. 'There's nothing I wouldn't do for him.'

She says that the flies came from fertilizer in the house and that the rodents were meant to be fed to Gavan's snakes who are now missing.

The forensic entomologist Avolt said that she was able to identify Gavan's body by matching the screws and metal plate in his leg that matched medical records.

Gavan's cause of death is unknown but Avolt says that a toxicology report will point to more answers.

'Once toxicology is done,' she said, 'then I can issue cause and manner.'

An ongoing investigation by law enforcement is underway. No charges have been issued as of yet.Â
