Increased temperatures on America's West Coast are not a result of human-caused climate change, but rather naturally occurring wind changes according to a new study.

The 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming that has been recorded on the coast of the northwest Pacific Ocean is due to weaker winds and changing ocean circulation, not a buildup of greenhouse gasses.

These weaker winds accounted for more than 80% of the warming trend along the Pacific Northwest coast between Washington and Northern California, and 60% of the warming in Southern California.

Getting hotter: Temperature increases on the coast of the northwest Pacific Ocean (above) are due to weaker winds and changing ocean circulation

Not expected: In places like Oregon (above) 80% of the warming trend is due to weaker winds, not global warming

This was discovered in a study conducted by researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington. 

'Changing winds appear to explain a very large fraction of the warming from year to year, decade to decade and the long-term,' said study leader James Johnstone according to the Los Angeles Times. 

The slower the wind gets, the less evaporation that occurs, which then leads to lower pressure, less rain, and, over time, higher temperatures.

Greenhouse gasses do, however. play some role in the rising temperature, just not as much as had been assumed in this region of the world.

Most of the warming occurred between 1900 and 1940 the study found, when the wind was much weaker and greenhouse gasses far, far lower.

Keeps rising: temperatures in places like Washington (above) have increased roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past 100 years

Some however are calling this study into question, including Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research., who questions if there is enough data, and the quality of the data, from the first half of the twentieth century to make these claims.

He also said this study in no way calls into question 'the concept of global warming.'

According to a new study increased temperatures on the West Coast of America are the result of changing wind patterns, not global warming

Temperatures in that area have increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past 100 years
