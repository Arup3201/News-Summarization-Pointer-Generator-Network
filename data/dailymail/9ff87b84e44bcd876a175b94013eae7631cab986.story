James Costello became one of the iconic figures of last year's Boston bombing tragedy when he was photographed staggering from the blast peppered with shrapnel, his clothes shredded and his legs burned.

AP photographer Kenshin Okubo captured the April 15, 2013 image of what Costello later described as 'one of the worst days of my life, suffering not only physical injuries of my own but the emotional difficulties when I learned about my friends' - three of whom each lost a leg in the tragedy.

Now Mr Costello's horrific experience has been used by The Daily Telegraph to mock Mike Carlton, sacked columnist of the rival Sydney Morning Herald in a tit-for-tat media feud. It comes after weeks of News Corporation papers The Daily Telegraph and The Australian accusing the Herald of publishing insensitive anti-Semitic cartooons and columns on the Gaza conflict.

First edition blunder: This is the Daily Telegraph's first edition printed on Thursday, August 7, featuring the photoshopped image of Boston bombing victim, James Costello - who became one of the iconic figures of the terrorist attack tragedy -  on the right hand side of Page 11. The image shows the stricken body of Mr Costello as he staggered around dazed in shredded clothing with severe burns to his legs and shrapnel wounds. The paper replaced his face with that of Sydney Morning Herald columnist Mike Carlton's, complete with an Arab headdress

The original: This is the real photograph taken of 30-year-old James Costello as he staggered from the blast of the Boston bombing on April 15, 2013, his body peppered with shrapnel, his right leg severely burned and his mind dazed and fearful that he was going to die. The Daily Telegraph used this image of the terrorist attack victim in its pages on Thursday to attack a rival publication

Social media users condemned the Telegraph for using the agonising photograph of Mr Costello in his darkest hour, topping it with an image of Carlton wearing Middle Eastern headdress.

On Twitter, one reader said '@NewsCorp's Sydney @DailyTelegraph depicted a Boston bombing victim as a 'terrorist'. They think this is funny'.

The Telegraph published the offending image in its first edition on Thursday, August 7. By its second edition, the newspaper had replaced the image of Mr Costello's body with the torso of a man wearing a buttoned brown suit coat and shirt.

The photoshop blunder comes after an attack by another News Corp newspaper on its Fairfax Media rival over a Sydney Morning Herald cartoon on the Gaza conflict, which had deeply offended the Australian Jewish community.

On Monday, Fairfax editor Darren Goodsir apologised for a cartoon by Glen Le Lievre, which had depicted a Jewish man in an armchair pointing a remote control towards a building erupting in a bombing attack.

Whoops, take two: The Daily Telegraph removed the photograph of Boston bombing victim James Costello from the photoshopped image, replacing his injured torso with that of a man buttoned up in a brown suit, but keeping Mike Carlton's head and the Yasser Arafat style headdress

Unreserved apology: Telegraph editor Paul Whittaker

The cartoon had accompanied a column written by Sydney media commentator Mike Carlton, who likened Israeli attacks on Palestinians in Gaza to 'genocide'.

Carlton was criticised for being anti-Semitic and resigned on Wednesday from the Sydney Morning Herald.

The Daily Telegraph covered the resignation in its first edition the following day with the photoshopped image of James Costello, which featured on a page with a mock masthead of its rival entitled 'The Sydney Warring Herald'.

On Twitter, @Show Patience responded to the image, saying 'Talk about a tabloid news organization with mistruths and false depictions. shame'.

Also on Twitter, @Brendan_E said, 'this is disgusting' and @glenpen60 described it as 'Absolutely disgraceful'.

Mr Carlton told Daily Mail Australia that the photoshopped image of the Boston bombing victim was 'a new low in bad taste'.

'It's a third rate photoshop anyway and the Telegraph is no longer a newspaper, it's a comic,' he said .'But to use the victim of a terrorist attack, it stinks. It is vile and scummy, but [from] the Daily Telegraph, not surprising.'

Following the Boston bombing, the victim James Costello revealed that moments before the iconic photograph of him staggering down the street was taken, he had just removed two rusty nails from his stomach and had thought, momentarily, that he might be dying.

Not impressed: Twiiter has erupted with protests from readers about the use of the iconic photograph a Boston Marathon terrorist bombing victim James Costello (right side of the Twitter image) in a photoshopped image (left) with media commentator Mike Carlton's face an an Arab headdress

Twitter user @glenpen60 thought the use of Mr Costello's photograph in a Daily Telegraph attack on its rival 'disgraceful'

Social media users are unhappy about the Daily Telegraph's use of the Boston bombing victim's image in its attack on the Sydney Morning's Herald's coverage of the Gaza conflict in a cartoon and column which were critical of Israeli attacks on Palestinians

Happily, during his recovery Mr Costello met a nurse, Krista D’Agostino, nine months after the tragedy the pair became engaged.

The Daily Telegraph's editor Paul Whittaker responded to questions from Daily Mail Australia about the issue with an emailed statement, saying he was not aware of the image being published in his newspaper.

'The photoshopped image was an amalgam of different images put together during the art production process,' Mr Whittaker said.

'I was unaware that that particular image had been partially used. It is an inadvertent but regrettable mistake for which The Daily Telegraph apologises unreservedly.'

The ongoing conflict in Gaza city (pictured, above) is at the centre of the issue which the Daily Telegraph sought to photoshop an image of Boston marathon terrorist attack victim James Costello, causing a storm of protest from readers on Twitter
