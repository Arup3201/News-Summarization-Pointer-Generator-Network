Holidaymakers were shocked to see a monster rise from the deep - a giant anchor which has been buried under sands for hundreds of years.

Visitors to the Welsh beach saw the 12ft high anchor, which is estimated to be 170 years old, rise up out of the sands overnight, after a strong tide moved the shifting sands.

The one tonne anchor was recovered from Cefn Sidan Sands in Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, and tests will now be carried out it to discover where it came from.

The massive anchor was uncovered by the shifting sands in Carmarthen Bay, West Wales after remaining buried for 170 years

Visitors to the beach were stunned to find the 12ft anchor had been uncovered by the tide in a matter of hours

A tractor was required to lift the massive anchor, which weighed in at one tonne, from the sand and transport it for testing.

The anchor, while a significant piece of maritime history, is by no means the first large piece of debris to have been discovered at Cefn Sidan Sands.

The beach is known as Wales' equivalent of Africa's Skeleton Coast as over 300 ships have been wrecked at the picturesque beauty spot in the past.

Carmarthenshire Council spokesman Ron Cant said: 'Many wrecks floundered on Cefn Sidan before detailed records were made.

'Over time stormy weather and the shifting of vast tonnages of sand, the beach has given up scores of wrecks and jetsam and flotsam artifacts - including many anchors.

'Wreck provenance only started to be recorded in some detail when newspapers started to record in the first decade of the 19th century the misfortune of hapless mariners.

'Little if anything is known about the names of more than 300 vessels thought to have floundered there.'

The beach, part of the Pembrey Country Park leisure and nature complex, is often the resting place of the washed up skeletons of steel and wood vessels.

The mysterious debris is washed in on spring tides which often send the sea two miles up the shore.

As the sands levels rise and fall artifacts can be shifted or buried deeper, and many remain undiscovered for years.

Nature reserve rangers make daily sweeps of the beach to check for washed up items.

Senior Ranger Gavin Hall said: 'Finds have varied from lost cargoes of sun tan oil to coconut trees with coconuts that are washed up on the tide.

'But it is what is revealed from under the sand or storm ripped dunes that is of more interest.

'It is a veritable treasure trove of maritime ages past - Items can lie buried for several hundred years before being given up by the sands.'
