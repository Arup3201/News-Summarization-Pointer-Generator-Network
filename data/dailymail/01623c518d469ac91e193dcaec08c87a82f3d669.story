'Revenge': The prosecution were building a case against Aurora shooting suspect James Holmes that his actions were premeditated

James Holmes sent an ominous text message to a classmate he had tried awkwardly to flirt with: She should stay away from him. 'I'm bad news,' he wrote.

Weeks before the movie theater shooting spree that killed 12 people and wounded 50 others, the University of Colorado-Denver student suggested he suffered from 'dysphoric mania,' an especially troubling form of bi-polar disorder.

Worse, he seemed to say he had lost control of the mental disease.

It has now emerged that relatives of 
the people killed in the attack are due to hold a news conference on 
Tuesday to discuss unspecified events they say need to be addressed.

Anita Busch, a spokeswoman for the 
group, said in a statement that they would 'speak with one voice' for 
the benefit of all of the victims.

She did not elaborate on the topics 
to be discussed at the news conference, but said that she expected the 
families of most of the 12 people killed to be represented.

Meanwhile The New York Times reports how classmates watched James Holmes, 23, become more withdrawn and less stable in the weeks before his alleged attack on a midnight screening of the blockbuster Batman movie 'Dark Knight Rises.'

One woman, who was part of the University of Colorado's neurosciences program along with Holmes, told the newspaper that the shy student seemed to fancy her and tried to clumsily flirt with her.

He once sent her a text message in class that read 'Why are you distracting me with those shorts?'

When she was absent from class with stomach flu, he seemed concerned.

'You still sick, girl?' he asked.

Holmes was always a loner, always introverted and awkward, his classmates -- who talked to the Times anonymously -- said. However, they watched him become more isolated as the school year wound down.

When he failed an oral exam in June, his professors suggested that perhaps he should drop out of the program.

In March, prosecutors said last week, he told a student that he planned to 'kill people... and that he would do so when his life was over.'

In July, just a few weeks before the July 20 theater rampage in Aurora, Holmes sent the girl another message.

He wanted to know if she had heard of dysphoric mania. She hadn't. She asked if treatment was controlling it.

His startling answer: 'It was.'

She needed to stay away from him, 'because I'm bad news,' he warned her.

Dysphoric mania is a startling combination of depression -- despair, suicidal thoughts and even hallucinations and delusions -- and mania -- agitation, paranoia -- both at the same time.

In severe cases, patients can suffer from a dangerous cocktail of delusion, paranoia, violent agitation and suicidal thoughts.

It's not known whether dysphoric mania was the diagnosis Holmes' psychiatrist had given him or if he come up with it on his own.

Holmes' attorney said during a previous 
court hearing that he suffers from an unspecified mental illness and had
tried to get help, and local media have reported he saw at least three 
mental health professionals before the shooting.

Police were first alerted to Holmes' behavior six weeks before the shootings when he made unspecified threats to a professor six weeks before the shootings-- around the time he failed his year-end final exam.

Prosecutor Karen Pearson did not elaborate on the nature of the threats.
