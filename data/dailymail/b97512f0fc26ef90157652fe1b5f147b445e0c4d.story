Hundreds of British tourists were evacuated from Kenya last night as the capital Nairobi was rocked by bombings.

Holidaymakers had their trips cut short after the Foreign Office warned against travelling to beach resorts along the coast.

Travel firms chartered planes to bring people home early from Nairobi, the Indian Ocean resort of Mombasa and other parts of the country.

Yesterday, as anxious travellers 
arrived at Kenyan airports to check in for their flights to Britain, two
 bombs went off in Nairobi, leaving at least 13 dead and 70 injured.

The
 explosions follow a recent spate of terror attacks by the Islamist Al 
Shabaab group, including an explosion at a bus station that killed three
 and the discovery of a bomb at a hotel. These prompted the Foreign 
Office to alter its travel advice for Kenya, warning against all but 
essential travel to areas within 37 miles of the Kenya-Somali border and
 Nairobi.

It added: ‘There 
has been a spate of small-scale grenade, bomb and armed attacks in 
Nairobi, Mombasa, and North Eastern Province.’

The US, France and Australia have also issued alerts.

Most
 travel insurance policies are invalid in areas the Foreign Office rules
 are unsafe, so tour operators have cancelled Kenyan holidays.

came from a 14-seater matatu (minibus), and the second came from within 
the market

However,
 some tourists claimed the tour companies had overreacted to the 
Islamist terror threats, which are understood to include plans to bomb 
beach hotels and kidnap Western tourists.

More
 than 500 British tourists are expected to have been evacuated from the 
region by tomorrow night, with those expecting to visit Kenya in the 
next six months facing the cancellation of their holidays.

The
 unusual move follows intelligence warnings to the British Government of
 a high threat of attack in Mombasa and Nairobi by Al Shabaab, which is 
based in Somalia and is linked to Al Qaeda and the Nigerian group Boko 
Haram.

The group includes British fighters such as Samantha Lewthwaite,

Al
 Shabaab was behind the attack on Nairobi’s Westgate shopping mall in 
September, when 67 people were killed after its fighters took it over.

Tour
 operators Thomson and First Choice cancelled all flights to Mombasa 
until October and said 400 holidaymakers were being flown back.

Some 5,000 Britons are on holiday in Kenya, with an estimated 500 in the Mombasa area subject to the warning.

Long-haul
 travel firm Kuoni also flew customers home and said it would not be 
offering holidays to the Kenyan coast until the situation improved.

Returning Briton Sharron James said: ‘It is really scary.’

Miss
 James, 27, from Slough, Berkshire, who was on a two week tour in 
Mombasa, added: ‘We just want to get home now. It is really sad for 
Kenya.’

But some Britons said they would simply move along the coast to the Diani area, which is not covered by the warning.

IT
 consultant Gavin Moore, 31, from Hastings, East Sussex, said: ‘We have 
saved for a family holiday to Africa for a long time and we are not 
going to pack up and go home.’

Tour operators Thomson and First Choice have cancelled all flights to Kenya until the end of October as a result of the concerns

Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right) murdered British Army solder Drummer Lee Rigby in 2013

Islamic militant group Al-Shabab, which means 'The Youth' in Arabic, was formed in 2006 as a radical offshoot of the Islamic justice system.

It is thought to have between 9,000 and 15,000 members and in 2012, it joined the militant Islamist organisation al-Qaeda as a cell.

The group wants to overthrow the UN-backed government in Somalia, and is suspected of links to a string of attacks in neighbouring Kenya.

It has been pushed out of most of the main towns it once controlled, but it remains a potent threat.

As of 2013, pressure from African Union Mission In Somalia (AMISOM) and Ethiopian forces has largely degraded Al-Shabab’s control and conflict among senior leaders has exacerbated fractures within the group.

Following the death of British Army soldier Drummer Lee Rigby in May 2013, it emerged one of his murderers had travelled to Kenya to train with Al-Shabab.

Michael Adebolajo, 29, was arrested in Kenya in 2010 with five others. At the time, the head of Kenya's anti-terrorism unit said he believed Adebolajo was planning to train with Al-Shabab, yet he was released to British authorities in Kenya and deported.

Adebolajo and accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, were convicted in December last year of murdering Fusilier Lee Rigby outside his barracks in Woolwich.

The British Muslim converts ran him over in a car, almost decapitated him and then dragged him into the middle of the road while ordering onlookers to film them.

Adebolajo was given a whole-life term and Adebowale was jailed for a minimum of 45 years.

Explosion: Three people were killed and 16 were injured in a bomb attack at a Mombasa bus station earlier this month. Officials have blamed al-Shabab for the incident

Luxury: The coastal city of Mombasa is popular with British tourists, but many have had dream holidays cut short

Where exactly have tourists been warned they cannot go?

The latest advice for tourists is to avoid all but essential travel to Mombasa Island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek, north of the city, and Tiwi in the south.

However, the warning does not include the popular beach resort of Diani or Moi international airport, which is the gateway to the coast. I have a holiday booked on Kenya’s coast, will it be cancelled?

Tour operators will cancel any holidays that are based in the areas that have now been declared off-limits.

They are not obliged to cancel trips to other parts of Kenya. However, some companies, such as Thomson and First Choice, have also evacuated holidaymakers from Diani, which is not included in the latest advice.

Therefore it is advisable to contact your holiday company to see what its policy is. My holiday has been cancelled, what are my rights?

Rest assured, if you have booked through a tour operator you are entitled to a full refund or you will be offered an alternative trip.

Customers who have booked flights and accommodation separately should expect to be refunded as long as their accommodation is 

If you have booked your trip independently and have travel insurance it should pay out for any trips cancelled due to changing travel advice. Always make sure you check your policy closely.I am booked for a safari holiday and am not going near the south coast, will my trip still go ahead?

Tour operators offering trips to areas that are not affected by the latest travel update will go ahead as usual.What if I have a holiday to Kenya booked but don’t want to go following this news?Unless your trip is to one of the affected areas which tourists have been advised to avoid then your booking still stands.

Companies in general will not allow customers to cancel bookings to other parts of the country which are still considered safe according to government organisations.Where is considered safe?

Almost all of the rest of Kenya, including popular safari areas, is considered safe. The only new areas tourists have been told to avoid are Mombasa island and within 5km of the coast from Mtwapa creek in the north down to and including Tiwi in the south.

Long-standing advice about non-essential travel includes areas within 37 miles of the Kenya –Somali border, Kiwayu Island and coastal areas north of Pate Island (in the south east of the country), the Garissa district (in the east), the Eastleigh area of Nairobi and the slum areas of the Kenyan capital.
