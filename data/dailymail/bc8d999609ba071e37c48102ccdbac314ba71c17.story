Oscar Pistorius’s PR team have set up a Twitter account it claims will reveal ‘the hard truth’ about his imminent murder trial.

The paralympian is accused of murdering his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp and is due to stand trial at a Pretoria court on March 3, which will be televised.

Pistorius, also known as the Blade Runner, shot Ms Steenkamp dead on Valentine’s Day last year, but he claimed he mistook her for a burglar and denies murder.

However, the loose contempt of court laws in South Africa mean newspapers have reported the story with what some might say has been a carefree attitude to objectivity and this has clearly worried Pistorius’s PR team.

As a result they have set up a Twitter account called @OscarHardTruth, which immediately claimed would set the record straight.

After it was created on Sunday, a tweet was posted that said: ‘As the trial approaches, many untruths half truths and versions of the truth have, and shall be spread across the world.'

Another read: ‘We WILL address the truth and expose those with ulterior motives. The Truth will Prevail.’

However, these two tweets have since been deleted, with the only remaining post from Sunday carrying a more sober tone.

It said: ‘This feed will provide the hard truth as it unfolds and provide information that will become clearer during the trial.’

Other tweets on the profile link to stories about the trial that throw doubt on the prosecution case.

At the time of writing the account has attracted over 18,000 followers.

A South African judge ruled on Tuesday that most of Pistorius's trial can be broadcast live, but not the Paralympian's own testimony.

Judge Dunstan Mlambo said cameras would be allowed 'to obtain a video and audio recording' of opening arguments, the evidence of state witnesses, closing arguments and the verdict and sentencing.

But cameras will not be allowed to film Pistorius, witnesses for the defence, or anyone else who objects to appearing on camera, he added.

The news follows an allegation that Pistorius was looking at pornographic websites the night Steenkamp was shot and killed.

The paralympian used his mobile phone, which was recovered at his home in Pretoria, to access the material online, reports from in the South African media suggested recently.

A document, believed to be court papers leaked from the investigation, are thought to state data from the phone shows he would have visited the sites while Ms Steenkamp was in the building.

The document goes on to state the sites are in 'direct contrast to that of a loving couple spending their time together', it is alleged.

The reports come two days after it was claimed neighbours heard screams in between gunfire on the night Ms Steenkamp was killed.

Court documents suggest a final round of shots ‘extinguished’ the screams, it is believed.

On Valentine’s Day 2013, Pistorius is alleged to have shot the model four times through a locked bathroom door of his home in a gated community in Pretoria.

Pistorius says he thought his girlfriend was an intruder.

Pistorius took to Twiiter on the anniversary of the shooting and said: 'No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved - and continues to love Reeva.

'The pain and sadness - especially for Reeva's parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow.

The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.'

The claims come as the athlete was pictured posing with fans in Johannesburg.

In one picture, Pistorius looks relaxed and tanned as he poses with Tatum Moodley and Pegan Trivangalo.

Meanwhile, the family of Ms Steenkamp are said to be struggling as the trial approaches.

The model's father Barry, 69, recently suffered a near fatal stroke.

He is now at home in Port Elizabeth and is said to be recovering.

Mr Steenkamp's brother Mike said his condition was a direct result of the forthcoming trial.

He told the Sunday People: 'When my brother opened a newspaper report about the upcoming trial and an out-of-court settlement, it broke him to pieces.

'That's why he had a stroke. He is not coping very well.'
