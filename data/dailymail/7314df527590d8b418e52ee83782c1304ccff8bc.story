To some, the Des Plaines Oasis is just a glorified food court with hungry truckers and greasy snacks.

But for 21-year-old Kevin Walters, the glass pavilion straddling the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway in Illinois means so much more - he claims it's the site of his conception.

So when news broke that the highway rest stop would close on Sunday after more than 50 years to make way for new roads, the Crystal Lakes resident handcuffed himself to a door in protest.

'It is a weird story, I must 
admit,' Walters said, according to CBS Chicago. 'About 21 years ago, my parents were 
at a Phil Collins concert here in Chicago, and one thing led to another.
 They ended up at the oasis…and I was conceived there.'

When he was asked how he found out about his origins, he said it 'just sort of came out' during a conversation with his parents.

'They were like, ’Oh yeah, hey, we never really told you how you were born, or your conception,’ and my parents are weird people, so it’s not that surprising,' he said.

While Walters's one-man protest on Friday has received a lot of coverage from 103.9 The Fox radio station where he works, his parents (unsurprisingly) have not weighed in.

The oasis, as it’s known by locals, opened in 1959 and houses a customer service center, a 7-Eleven, gas station and numerous fast food joints.

With its floor-to-ceiling glass windows and range of facilities, it's a popular rest stop for travelers and concert-goers seeking a late night snack...or anything else.

But Chicago Tribune reported the mega rest stop will close for good on Sunday.

It
 will be torn down to make room for the Tollway's multibillion-dollar 
plans to add a fourth lane in each direction from O'Hare to Elgin, and 
to connect the Elgin O'Hare Expressway with I-90 and the Tri-State 
Tollway along O'Hare's western edge.

Expansion plans: The oasis will be closed on Sunday as part of Tollway's multibillion-dollar plan to add a fourth lane in each direction to the highway

Not just a truck stop: The oasis has been a popular rest stop for visitors and locals since it opened in 1959
