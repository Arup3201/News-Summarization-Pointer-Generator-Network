David Moyes insists that no-one is good enough to displace Wayne Rooney up front for both Manchester United and England.

Moyes, who put Rooney at the heart of his Manchester United side before being sacked in April after less than a year in charge, reckons that the best could be yet to come from the forward - so long as he concentrates on scoring goals rather than all-action forays across the pitch.

The Scot did, however, urge Rooney's team-mates to help ease the pressure on their captain by creating more chances for him.

Rooney has taken over the armband for both club and country this season but both teams have been lacklustre and the 28-year-old is showing far from his best form, despite scoring the winning goal in last week's friendly win over Norway.

Radamel Falcao's blockbuster loan signing at United has raised questions over Rooney's role in his club team, while Raheem Sterling's emergence has led to calls for the Liverpool starlet to fill the No 10 role in Roy Hodgson's side currently occupied by Rooney.

'Some people might wonder if we have seen the best of him. I don't,' Moyes told The Sun. 'I still believe he is one of the best in the Premier League.

'What he needs to make sure is that he's not trying to do everyone else's job too. Sometimes he feels like he has to do everything.

'Other players have to help Wayne, find him in the right positions, supply him so he can score goals.'

Rooney will lead England against Switzerland in Basle on Monday night in the Three Lions' first Euro 2016 qualifier.

Despite 19-year-old Sterling's brilliant displays for both Liverpool and England, Moyes made it clear that he thought Rooney remained a better player than anyone younger than him and deserved his lead role in Roy Hodgson's side.

Moyes also added that in future he could see Rooney dropping deeper into a midfield role but not while he still had plenty to offer as a striker.
