A schoolgirl who went to hospital suffering from headaches was horrified to be told she had a brain tumour the size of an orange.

Doctors discovered the benign tumour inside Holly Dougill-Brooks's brain after they realised she had lost sight in her left eye over a matter of months.

Holly, eight, had started getting headaches last year but after an eye test showed no problems a viral infection was put down as the cause.

Hope: Holly Dougill-Brooks will fly to Florida with her mother Melanie (left) for proton beam therapy, to treat her brain tumour

But the headaches came back in February and after visiting the GP with her mother Melanie Dougill, she was referred to the ophthalmic department at Northampton General Hospital.

When she had her appointment in July doctors said that unbeknown to Holly she had gone blind in her left eye. An emergency MRI scan revealed an orange-sized tumour in her brain.

Holly was diagnosed with craniopharyngioma, a slow-growing tumour which is normally impossible to remove without causing serious damage.

She had an operation to shrink the tumour by half around five weeks ago. She will travel to Jacksonville in Florida for a revolutionary treatment called proton beam therapy, which doctors hope will cure the condition.

However, she will be blind in her left eye for the rest of her life.

The treatment, which is only available in the USA, France and Switzerland, is similar to radiotherapy but does not damage the surrounding tissue, and reduces the risk of secondary tumours in later life.

Miss Dougill from East Hunsbury, Northampton, said: 'Holly deals with everything remarkably bravely. She is the most resilient child I've ever come across. She's happy, cheerful and takes it all completely in her stride.

'It's so hard to describe how we felt. It was absolute devastation. I don't think I'll ever forget that moment when they sat us down and said: "Holly has a brain tumour". But you learn to deal with it day by day.'

'Remarkably brave': Holly has already had one brain operation

Talking about Holly prior to the diagnosis, she added: 'We are pretty certain Holly's eyesight was fine when she first went to the opticians (in August 2010) and just deteriorated rapidly that year.

'There was nothing obvious at that point to suggest there was a problem. Her school teachers or family didn't notice anything. When I talked to Holly she thought it was no big deal.

'She had an emergency MRI on the Monday, and on the Wednesday we were called back and informed she had a brain tumour and was being referred to Nottingham for a biopsy and further investigation.'

The NHS is funding the U.S treatment, which is being coordinated by the National Specialised
Commissioning Team.

The health service is also paying Holly's and her mother's travel costs.

Miss Dougill's employer, the Continuum Group, is raising money to help Miss Dougill's partner Nathan and Holly's dad Alan to visit her during her treatment.

Miss Dougill said: 'It's fantastic. I can't thank them enough. They have really gone above and beyond what we expected anyone to do for us.'

Holly will undergo treatment for two months in America. It finishes on December 23 but she will be recovering for two weeks before she is well enough to fly back.

Miss Dougill added: 'She will have this condition for life. Essentially there will still be a tumour left in her brain but it won't be growing and will be significantly smaller.

'It has virtually destroyed her pituitary gland and she will be on medication for the rest of her life but she should be able to lead a normal life.'
