Elle McPherson: Tabata built this Body

Our inspirational fitness columnist Ruby Warrington reports from New York on the fitness and lifestyle trends that have transformed her life - and could do the same for you.

A workout that delivers maximum results in the minimum amount of time is the Holy Grail of fitness in New York.

Manhattanites want to stay in great shape, but they also need time for all that working and playing hard – which is why the 5.45pm Tabata class at my gym is always packed.

This is how it works: for 20 seconds, do an exercise as fast and hard as you can. Rest for 20 seconds. Repeat eight times. Essentially, that’s it.

Just four minutes of this patented protocol will burn as many calories as an hour on the treadmill.

Now that’s what you call efficient. But in a class, you then go on to do this routine for a total of 45 minutes.

SCIENCE MEETS FITNESS

It comes as little surprise to learn that this futuristic-sounding workout was actually developed in a lab.

It is named after Dr Izumi Tabata, the Japanese professor of sports science who invented it.

Back in 1997, Professor Tabata was working as an Olympic training coach for the Japanese speed-skating team when he began analysing the effectiveness of a training regime that involved rotating short bursts of maximum effort with short periods of rest.

Prof Tabata soon hit on High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which he believes is the magic formula for increasing both aerobic (cardiovascular) and anaerobic (muscle) fitness levels. It breaks down as 20 seconds on, ten seconds off, repeated eight times, for a total of four minutes.

NO PAIN NO GAIN

Back in class, this translates into a boot-camp atmosphere and lots of shouting from the teacher – because, in the words of Prof Tabata himself, ‘it has to feel extremely difficult for it to be working’.

‘You should be pushing yourself so hard you are NOT PHYSICALLY ABLE TO FINISH THE SET!!’ our teacher shrieks above the pounding techno soundtrack.

The idea is that you go to your absolute 
edge in any of the given exercises, which are all designed to raise your
 heartbeat as much and as quickly as possible.

Exhaustion rotation: Tabata sees you do an exercise as fast and hard as you can for 20 seconds, rest for 20, and then repeat eight times

This might mean a punishing round of ‘spicy burpees’ – where you crouch down, place your hands on the ground and jump back into a plank, before performing two push-ups, jumping back to your hands and springing up so your feet come off the floor – or a bout of ‘sumo jumping jacks’, where on each jump in and out you land in a static squat and hold it for one agonising beat.

IT’S ONLY 20 SECONDS

It all sounds pretty terrifying, I admit. But actually, because you know you’ll get ten blissful seconds of rest for every 20 seconds of effort, it’s easy to stay motivated.

Which isn’t to say I’m not always gasping for air – not to mention feeling light-headed and sometimes like I might actually be sick – within minutes of the class getting underway. Oh, and you sweat buckets.

Elle Macpherson and new Superman actor Henry Cavill are already fans – and classes will be starting in the UK this year.

If you want to do it at home, there are masses of YouTube videos featuring variations on the workout.

Whether or not you’ll be motivated to push through each and every set without an actual live drill sergeant barking at you is another question, however. But don’t be scared to give it a try – after all, you can do anything for 20 seconds, right?
