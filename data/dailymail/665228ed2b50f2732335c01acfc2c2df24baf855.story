Kenny Jackett hopes Arsenal forward Benik Afobe can add firepower to his Wolves side after wasteful finishing almost cost them at Ewood Park.

A David Edwards piledriver just after half-time ensured Wolves clinched a win which lifted them to within a point of the play-offs.

But the victory should have been more comfortable with Wolves guilty of failing to take a number of clear-cut opportunities.

And Jackett hopes the permanent signing of England Under-21 goalscorer Afobe from the Gunners, which could be sealed within 24 hours, will solve that issue.

Afobe has scored 19 goals in 27 on-loan appearances for League One MK Dons, including two in their 4-0 thrashing of Manchester United in the Capital One Cup.

‘We’ve watched Afobe come through at Arsenal and seen his progress,’ Jackett said. ‘He’s proved an asset at MK Dons and is ready to (make the) step up.’

Wolves were without seven-goal top scorer Bakary Sako who has linked up with Mali for the Africa Nations Cup but compatriot Nouha Dicko showed his early threat.

Playing as a lone striker he burst into the box and forced Rovers goalkeeper Jason Steele to make a save smart at his near post.

That seemed to rouse the home side into life and a deep cross into the penalty area from left-back Markus Olsson was flicked on by Rudy Gestede for fellow striker Jordan Rhodes, but he could only head over from close range.

Ben Marshall went close for the hosts when he curled a spectacular 25-yard free-kick over the Wolves defensive wall, but visiting goalkeeper Carl Ikeme scrambled across his goal and dived to parry the ball to safety.

Despite Blackburn’s pressure immediately before the interval it was Wolves who opened the scoring three minutes after the break with a well worked goal.

Dicko’s clever pass found Edwards, who with a flick of his left boot took the ball away from Grant Hanley to open up space on the edge of the box and then with his right foot arrowed a low shot into the bottom-left corner.

The Wolves fans in the Darwen End then breathed a sigh of relief shortly after when Richard Stearman misjudged a headed clearance and struck the post of his own goal.

A neat passing move from Wolves saw them create another gilt edge chance when Dicko spread the play out to James Henry who crossed for Edwards, and he somehow failed to hit the target from close range.

Wolves sensed the chance to kill off the game and Dicko’s brilliant curling effort rattled the the top-right corner of the goalframe, with Rajiv van La Parra unable to profit from the rebound.

Henry was the next Wolves player guilty of poor finishing with 10 minutes remaining when he fluffed his close-range finish from Dicko’s low cross.

Blackburn pushed for an equaliser in the remainder of the game and went close when substitute Craig Conway outmuscled Kortney Hause and brought a near post save out of Ikeme.

The Wolves keeper had to be alert again a minute from time as Josh King struck a powerful low effort from distance which Ikeme smothered, but the visitors hung on.
