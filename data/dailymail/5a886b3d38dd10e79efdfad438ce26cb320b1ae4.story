Fabian Delph believes he could have earned more money by switching clubs this summer but leaving Aston Villa for nothing ‘would not have sat right’ with him.

The England midfielder admitted the prospect of moving to a team challenging for Europe had been tempting but insisted the pull of becoming a Villa hero swung the balance.

He conceded his decision had shocked team-mates but argued he can make Roy Hodgson’s Euro 2016 squad playing regularly under Paul Lambert.

He also revealed his close bond with owner Randy Lerner, who offered words of encouragement during a year with a serious knee injury, proved a factor.

Delph surprised many by penning a four-and-a-half-year deal worth £55,000 per week despite interest from Liverpool and Tottenham, who he could have joined on a free this summer once his previous deal ran out.

‘I feel like I’ve been treated really good by the club. It wouldn’t have sat right with me leaving, especially on a free,’ said Delph. ‘Being on a free means financially I would have been better off. But I’m a kid from Bradford, brought up on a council estate. I am not money-driven.

‘I live a simple life. I love my family, and take care of them. If I can play week in, week out and feel like I’m still developing, I’m happy.

‘The lads are absolutely delighted. As soon as I told some of them they looked at me shocked to start with. Most people in my situation would be looking to move on.

‘They know what type of guy I am – I’m quite driven. They expected me to try to challenge for something that others clubs are challenging for. It would have been exciting.

‘But I got into the England side by playing here and I’m sure I can stay in the England squad playing here.

‘I’ve got a lot of time for people at this club, even the cleaners. I love my team-mates. I see them as brothers. I’d run through a brick wall for them.

‘The chairman has been great. As a young boy, injured, for the guy who has invested money in me to call me saying, “Don’t worry you’ll come out the other end”, you can imagine what that meant to me. It was huge.’

Delph instructed his agent not to come to him with offers from clubs this month.

‘If I made the decision to leave Villa when I was out of contract, then conversations can start. Until then, there was no way I was going to be speaking to anybody. I told my agent to leave me alone as I want to focus on my football and getting myself fit.’

Delph did not elaborate on whether his contract contained a release clause.

‘I’m happy here and wanting to push on,’ he said. ‘If somebody did come in the future, put a bid in and it was right for the club I’m sure people would have a look at it. I’m here to stick it out.’

That includes providing Villa supporters with more to cheer than in recent years. An FA Cup run would help. 

‘It would be absolutely terrific for the fans. I’ve been fighting relegation for three years. They have had to watch it. For them to have a bit of joy would be great.’
