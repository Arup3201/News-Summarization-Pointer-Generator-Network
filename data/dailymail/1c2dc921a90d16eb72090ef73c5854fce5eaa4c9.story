These haunting images provide a rare glimpse inside a dilapidated New York City hospital that has become a popular stop for curious tourists after being shut for 60 years.

Like a scene from a horror film the long-abandoned immigrant hospital on Ellis Island is filled with eerie corridors, crumbling rooms and forgotten equipment.

It was where one out of ten arrivals deemed too ill to enter the US were sent to recover or die as they landed in America aboard ships from overseas.

Tourists can look inside rooms that were previously shut, including a linen room where mattresses were dried after being cleaned

Ellis Island – known as the ‘Gateway to America’ – was the country’s largest and most active immigration station from 1892 to 1924.

More than 12 million newcomers were processed, but some were deemed unfit for entry and sent to the hospital which is in ruins after years of decay.

The 29-building medical complex, which opened in 1902, was in its day the largest public health institution in America.

A giant cage was attached to this building, which was used to house psychiatric patients after they arrived from overseas

It operated as a hospital until 1930 and was left to rot when the immigration station closed in 1954.

Located on the Hudson River between the Statue of Liberty and Lower Manhattan, Ellis Island's main building was restored and reopened as an immigration museum in 1990.

But the hospital complex on the island's south side remained shuttered until officials reopened the buildings for public viewing.

Gordon Donovan, from New York, captured these incredible images during a hard-hat tour through select areas of the 750-bed medical complex, including large hospital wards, kitchens, laundry facilities and morgues.

He said: ‘The tour is for history buffs and especially photography lovers.

‘The fading colours of the interiors, corroding machinery, metal stairs and doors, strong textures and challenging lighting are wonderful photography experiences.’ 

For $25 per person, visitors are taken on a 90-minute guided tour of some of the hospital's buildings, including its powerhouse

Much of the medical equipment has been removed over the years but visitors can still see some of the original machinery

Superintendent John Piltzecker of the Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island added: ‘Even though much of the hospital equipment is no longer here, these special buildings are able to speak volumes.

‘The National Park Service is pleased to work with Save Ellis Island in their efforts to bring visitors to the South Side to learn more about the island's unique story through this special tour program.’

Led by a group called Save Ellis Island, the 90-minute guided tours cost $25 (approximately £15) per person.
