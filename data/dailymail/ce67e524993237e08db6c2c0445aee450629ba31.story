Cameras are to be allowed into court for the first time from today, ending a 90-year ban.

The decision to allow filming of the closing stages of cases at the Court of Appeal has been hailed as a ‘landmark moment for justice and journalism’.

Ministers rejected fears it would lead to ‘Americanising’ of the justice system, where trials of the likes of OJ Simpson to Michael Jackson have become treated as entertainment.

In focus: Cameras have been positioned around the Royal Courts of Justice to broadcast live pictures from selected court cases from tomorrow

Hidden: Remote-controlled cameras tucked away on bookcases will capture the summing up and sentencing of selected cases

It will be the first time that cameras have been allowed in courts other than the Supreme Court since filming was banned by the Criminal Justice Act 1925.

Lawyers' arguments and judges' summing up, decision and - in criminal cases - sentencing remarks may be filmed.

However victims, witnesses and defendants will not be captured on camera and proceedings will only be shown from one courtroom per day.

Small, remote-controlled cameras will be operated by the court video journalist Matt Nichols, who has both legal and journalistic qualifications.

While the footage can be used by news and current affairs programmes but it cannot feature in adverts or on comedy shows like Have I Got News For You.

The filming could be extended, with ministers now considering allow cameras to capture sentencing remarks in Crown Courts, with victims, witnesses, offenders and jurors still protected.

Limits: Court video journalist Matt Nicholls will operate the cameras and ensure that no witnesses are seen on screen

From Judge Judy to Judge John Deed, from OJ Simpson to Michael Jackson, a host of pop-culture personas have been cited when airing anxieties over filming in court.

A fear of ‘Americanising’ the justice system has been frequently raised by critics of allowing cameras in court, particularly in the wake of the trials of OJ Simpson and Dr Conrad Murray in the US and Amanda Knox in Italy.

The Simpson murder trial in LA, where the former professional American football player was accused of killing his wife and a friend, was one of the first major cases to catch the public's attention.

Footage of Simpson's lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, standing in front of the jury holding a glove saying ‘If it doesn't fit, you must acquit’ has gone down in courtroom history. Simpson was acquitted in 1995.

Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, who enjoyed a lengthy career in broadcasting before joining Parliament, said: ‘This is not about transparency or democracy, it is about television showbusiness and we do not need our law courts to be turned into yet another reality TV show.’

The decision to open up courts to the TV media comes after years of campaigning by broadcasters BBC, ITN, Press Association and Sky News.

James Harding, BBC director of news and current affairs, said: ‘This is a landmark moment for justice and journalism. It is a significant step on the way to helping millions of viewers gain a greater understanding of how our judicial system works.’

Judges hope the move will allow the public to better understand what actually happens in court.

The most senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, said: ‘‘This will help a wider audience to understand and see for themselves how the Court of Appeal goes about its work.’

There are a number of safeguards in place to protect the administration of justice, ensure no disruption to proceedings and protect witnesses and victims.

Some cases will be broadcast live with a 70-second delay to allow the removal of anything that contravenes broadcasting regulations or standard court reporting restrictions - such as contempt of court laws and court orders.

In addition, appeals against conviction which might result in a re-trial will only be shown once the case is decided, and and the judge can order no filming or broadcasting if it is in the interests of justice.

ITN chief executive John Hardie said: ‘Filming in courts has been a long time coming and is for the benefit of open justice and democracy. Never before will television viewers have had such an insight to justice being seen to be done.’

Head of Sky News John Ryley said: ‘Seeing justice being done will no longer be restricted to those members of the public who have the opportunity and time to go to court.

‘We anticipate that the next step should be to allow the filming of sentencing remarks in criminal trials, which the coalition Government envisaged when it first announced the lifting of the camera ban two years ago.’

Almost all the proceedings of the Supreme Court have been filmed since it opened in 2009 and are sometimes broadcast on major TV and radio news networks.

And broadcasters in Scotland have been allowed to apply to film in court since 1992, but only with the consent of all parties.

A pilot took place in the Court of Appeal in the Royal Courts of Justice in 2005, in which cameras were allowed to film in the court. Footage from the pilot study was not broadcast.

Courts minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘This is a landmark moment that will give the public the opportunity to see and hear the decisions of judges in their own words.

‘It is another significant step towards achieving our aim of having an open and transparent justice system.

‘We are clear that justice must be seen to be done and people will now have the opportunity to see that process with their own eyes. It will also help further the public's understanding of the often-complex process of criminal and civil proceedings.’

Captured: One of the most famous snatched pictures from an English court was taken of Dr Hawley Crippen with Ethel Le Neve, his alleged accomplice, during their trial for murder in 1910

The ban on bringing cameras into court - including video cameras - dates back to 1925.

But even before this date, taking pictures was not supported by the court and photographers were supposed to seek permission.

One of the most famous ‘snatched’ pictures from a courtroom was taken of the notorious Dr Crippen and his mistress Ethel Le Neve in 1910 as he stood trial for the murder of his wife.

While publishing photos from courtrooms was debated in the House of Commons and broadly opposed by politicians, it was not until 1925 that legislation was brought in banning photos and sketches.

A small passage in the Criminal Justice Act 1925, which mainly dealt with the system of probation, said: ‘No person shall (a) take or attempt to take in any court any photograph, or with a view to publication make or attempt to make in any court any portrait or sketch, of any person, being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court, whether civil or criminal; or (b) publish any photograph, portrait or sketch taken or made in contravention of the foregoing provisions of this section or any reproduction thereof.’

More recently, individuals who have taken photographs in court have been dealt with under contempt of court laws rather than under the 1925 Act. 

A 19-year-old man who took pictures inside Luton Crown Court on his mobile phone was jailed for two months in 2011, while a Frenchman was held behind bars for two hours after taking a picture during Julian Assange's appearance at the High Court.

Since it opened in 2009, almost all the proceedings of the Supreme Court are filmed and are sometimes broadcast on major TV and radio news networks.

Even under the latest changes there is no chance of a Dr Crippen style shot - only judges' remarks will be shown - not those of victims, witnesses, offenders or jurors.
