'Lisa Filth': Stapley advised a friend to leave town within minutes of an assault being reported

A lesbian police community support officer known to friends as 'Lisa Filth' has been jailed for passing on confidential information to other gay people in her area.

In the worst data breach Lisa Stapley, 39, who was recruited by North Wales Police because she is gay, tipped off a lesbian friend wanted for assault with a text saying: 'Get out of Wrexham, the police are looking for you.'

Jailing her for ten months at Mold Crown Court, Judge Philip Hughes said that she had breached trust after she admitted four charges of misconduct in public office.

The worse incident was when, within 
five minutes of an assault complaint being made, Stapley sent a string of 
text messages to a friend telling her to get out of town.

She
sent a total of 19 text messages to that friend while meant to be 
on duty, also suggesting an alibi strategy for her to use if the police caught up with
her.

Judge Philip Hughes 
said that she had provided confidential police information to other 
people but added there was no financial gain.

In three of the four charges, while serious, she was not advancing 
any criminal purpose for anyone else or prejudicing any police 
operation.

In those instances she could be described as 'misguided and naive', the judge said,' adding, 'By doing so you helped your friend evade the attention of the police'.

'That is the most serious aspect of your offending.

'It was a gross breach of trust.

'The court has a duty not only to punish you but to send out a 
message to those who work in the police, either as police officers or 
community support officers, that such behaviour is so serious that only 
immediate custody can be imposed,' he said.

There were three other breaches.

Prosecuting barrister Paulinus Barnes said she accessed the force's system to obtain information when her former civil partner was allegedly assaulted by her new girlfriend.

Stapley also sent her a text saying: 'How dare she lay a finger on you. God help her if I see her.'

The new partner then raised concerns at Wrexham police station and an 
investigation showed Stapley had accessed police computer records about 
her former partner nine times.

On another occasion she gave her then partner a police printout relating to an incident where a work colleagueâ€™s daughter had gone missing.

And she also used her force issue Blackberry mobile phone to do a background check on the seller of a car for a friend.

Her barrister Patrick Cassidy said that his client was a lesbian who was recruited by North Wales Police as part of its equality and diversity policy.

Stapley had been recruited in 2008 and there were no problems when she initially worked in Anglesey.

But she was posted to her home town of Wrexham, where she had worked for ten years as a taxi driver, and where she was a member of the very close-knit lesbian community, which she knew well, he explained.

She suffered from depression, and in 2009 her civil partnership broke down and her mother died.

'She tipped off a friend', Mr Cassidy said.

'There was no payment or any corruption above and beyond the act itself.'

When interviewed, she had said that she had acted out of concern and told how she saw herself as an unofficial point of contact for the lesbian community of Wrexham.

She said that she would receive calls from unidentified people telling her about incidents that she felt obliged to research.
