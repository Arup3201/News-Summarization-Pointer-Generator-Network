Decision: Bruce Davis, a former Charles Manson follower who has spent more than 40 years in prison

One of cult leader Charles Manson’s follower was denied parole and will continue to serve his jail sentence after the California governor stepped in and stopped him from being released.

The state’s parole board had recently approved the release of 70-year-old Bruce Davis, who was convicted in two Manson-related murders, since he has served more than four decades in prison.

Governor Jerry Brown reversed that decision and ordered Davis to remain in jail after having a meeting with the Los Angeles district attorney.

'I find the evidence ... shows why he currently poses a danger to society if released from prison. Therefore, I reverse the decision to parole Mr. Davis,' the written decision said.

Davis would have been only the second Manson-related murder defendant to be granted parole since the killing spree began in 1969.

Davis was not involved in the notorious Sharon Tate-LaBianca killings but was convicted with Manson and others in the murders of a musician and a stuntman.

Brown's six-page decision focused on Davis' role in the murderous Manson Family in the late 1960s.

'The record indicates that Davis fully embraced and championed the family's distorted values and goals, and was willing to protect the family's interests at all costs,' the decision said.

Brown said that Davis' refusal to fully acknowledge his responsibility for two killings was central to his decision.

'I do not believe that Davis was just a
reluctant follower who passively went along with the violence,' he 
said. 'Davis was older, more experienced, he knew what the Manson Family
was capable of, and he knowingly and willingly took part in these 
crimes.'

The decision outlined in gruesome 
detail the killings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman ranch hand 
Donald 'Shorty' Shea. Manson was a direct participant in both killings, 
according to witnesses.

Steve Grogan, another participant in 
those murders, was released many years ago after he agreed to lead 
police to where the bodies were buried on a remote movie ranch in the 
San Fernando Valley.

The decision relied heavily on trial 
testimony of Barbara Hoyt, a former Manson Family member who has become a
constant attendee at parole hearing and an advocate for keeping all 
members of the cult in prison.

Many of the details she gave were 
proven wrong when the bodies were exhumed. She had spoken of dismembered
bodies but both men's bodies were found intact.

'Until Davis can acknowledge and 
explain why he actively championed the family's interests and shed more 
light on the nature of his involvement, I am not prepared to release 
him,' Brown said.

Davis was 30 when he was sentenced to 
life in prison in 1972 in the case that was a postscript to Manson's 
notorious reign as leader of the murderous communal cult.

Davis long maintained that he was a 
bystander in the killing of the two men. But in recent years, he has 
acknowledged his shared responsibility. He said his presence may have 
emboldened others to take action because he was an elder of the group.

Davis became a born-again Christian in
prison and ministered to other inmates, married a woman he met through 
the prison ministry, and has a grown daughter. The couple recently 
divorced.

Davis also earned a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy of religion.

Brown commended him for his self-help efforts but said the work was outweighed by other factors.

'After 42 years of incarceration, it 
is encouraging that Davis is beginning to reveal the actual details of 
what happened. But it is clear that he continues to withhold information
about these events,' Brown said.

The governor's decision echoed that of
his predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who also reversed a parole board
that found Davis suitable for parole.

Manson and three of his followers, 
Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles 'Tex' Watson, remain 
in prison for life in the Tate killings. Their co-defendant, Susan 
Atkins, died of cancer behind bars in 2009.
