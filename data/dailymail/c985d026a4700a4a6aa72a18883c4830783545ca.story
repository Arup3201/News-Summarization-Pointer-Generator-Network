Construction sites are regularly labelled ugly eyesores, but a new video has revealed they can be elegant and even beautiful.

A total of 42 cranes were 'choreographed' by their drivers during the Kranensee event - dubbed 'a ballet of cranes' - in the town of Aspern, Vienna in February.

Production company FilmSpektakel recorded a timelapse of these dancing cranes throughout the day, which climaxed with a 30-minute light show.

Local
 residents were invited to come and view the dancing cranes throughout 
the day and the 30-minute long light show began after sunset.

Peter
 Jablonowski  and Thomas Pöcksteiner from Vienna-based FilmSpektakel 
spent the whole day at the construction site in February to film the 
timelapse video.

The cranes are currently being used in the Urban Lakeside Vienna project in the town of Aspern, just outside the Austrian capital.

Urban Lakeside Vienna is Europe’s largest construction site and the project is building a 590-acre suburb for 20,000 people - complete with a 'shopping mile' - set to open next year.

The Kranensee event was organised by the Aspern Urban Lakeside management company and took place on 15 February.
