Charismatic Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp saw the funny side of his team's current predicament when trying to explain their injury crisis ahead of taking on Arsenal at the Emirates on Wednesday evening.

The Gunners know a draw against Dortmund will ensure progression to the knockout stages of the Champions League having drawn 3-3 with Anderlecht in the Champions League last month before losing to Swansea City and Manchester United in the Premier League.

There hasn't been much for Klopp to laugh about with his side languishing in the Bundesliga's bottom three following a 2-2 draw with minnows Paderborn on Saturday.

Star names Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan, and Henrikh Mkhitaryan have all had spells on the sidelines but instead of churning out the usual platitudes at his Champions League press conference on Tuesday, the German offered up his own unique way of describing the situation.

'We know about the reasons but we've also had injuries with the foot that we've never heard about. Sometimes one comes through the other,' said Klopp, before bursting into laughter.

Journalists were lost as to what Klopp's explanation could mean and the 47-year-old responded: 'You don't understand? What a pity?

'You should learn, there's a very good German explanation for some problems, Alles hat eine ende nur die wurst hat zwei ' - but Klopp couldn't pick out the right translation and needed an interpreter to explain 'everything has an end except for a sausage has two.'

Klopp had the press room in stitches but managed to compose himself to continue: 'With injuries, they start to play and the next thing, [there is] another problem. If you look at Marco Reus, all the injuries are because of that.

'It is a problem for the players with no injuries, too, because they have to play all the time.

'I can't have a squad with 45 players. It is not a problem with training. We didn't get silly over the past year. We know how to train.'

As a consequence of Dortmund's Bundesliga troubles, Klopp is relishing taking on the Gunners, as the Champions League has been a happy hunting ground for his side so far this campaign.

'Now, I can't change the Bundesliga situation,' he said. 'It is little bit like a holiday for me. It is only the Champions League. But Bundesliga, we go back to that on Sunday.'

Despite his comical side, Klopp is serious when he says he takes the blame for their slump in the Bundesliga.

'I feel maximum responsibility for this because it is easy to celebrate victories together, it is easy to feel responsible for winning games,' Klopp continued.

'It is much more difficult to handle this feeling now because I am responsible, of course. Sometimes I make mistakes. All the faults together is my responsibility, for sure.'
