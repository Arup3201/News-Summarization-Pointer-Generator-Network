I was at Carrow Road to watch Norwich 0-0 Manchester City, and here is the Durham Dossier.

Lots of expensive attacking players forgot how to score.

Blunted: Strikers Edin Dzeko (left) and Alvaro Negredo (right) were left frustrated at Norwich

Manuel
 Pellegrini. He hasn’t won anything in Europe as a manager, but he’s 
been gifted a golden opportunity to do something special and historic at
 Manchester City. It looks to me like he was out-coached by Mourinho on 
Monday and had no answer, and you could even argue he was out-coached by
 Chris Hughton at Norwich.

Expectations: Manuel Pellegrini will be considered a failure if he can't win a trophy this season

Nous: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho out-thought Pellegrini in their midweek clash

Read Mark Ryan's report from Carrow Road

Fernandinho has been brilliant but Pellegrini has struggled to cope 
without the midfielder. The elite managers are made of stronger stuff 
than that. And when you need a goal I’m not sure Aleksandar Kolarov for Alvaro Negredo was
 the right substitution, and indeed City didn’t score and didn’t really 
threaten after that substitution. In fact Norwich looked more likely to 
win it.

Martin Demichelis made Chico Flores look like Rambo at one point in the second half. Being useless, the Argentine centre back completely misjudged a bouncing ball and realised it was about to sail over his head to send Gary Hooper clear on goal.

Back to your feet: Manchester City's Martin Demichelis spent too much time on the ground at Carrow Road

So after feeling the slightest touch of Gary Hooper’s fingertips on his back he threw himself forward to the ground, and somehow referee Jon Moss bought it and blew for a free kick. Demichelis was booed, I suspect by his own fans as well as the Norwich faithful.

Maybe Yaya Toure was frustrated with his own dreadful performance but 
that’s no excuse to kick out at an opponent who’s on the floor.

Ricky van Wolfswinkel and Yaya went for a ball, for some strange reason
 the Ivorian decided to flick a boot at the Dutchman. He should have 
seen red, City are lucky he didn’t. Another one missed by ref Jon Moss, 
who should have stuck to drumming with Culture Club.

In pain! Ricky van Wolfswinkel is left on the deck after receiving a kick from Yaya Toure

Distraught: The pair went up for a ball together and Van Wolfswinkel was left incandescent with rage

Norwich fans were magnificent, getting behind their team, even if celebrating a home draw like they’d won a trophy was a touch over the top. But that song they sing – 'On The Ball, City' - is just plain wrong.

Not giving up: A Norwich fan sings loud and proud during the uninspiring 0-0 draw

Its opening line probably didn’t make sense when it was first penned in 1902: 'Kick off, throw in, have a little scrimmage.' Does this only have meaning in Norfolk? Fair play to them, they sung it very loud and proud. Unfortunately the last line 'Hurrah we’ve scored a goal' (I’m not joking) had no relevance to this game.

Nathan Redmond. The Norwich teenager has got pace and balance, his touch is usually excellent, but his final ball – be it a shot or a cross – needs improvement.

He can play wide and in the hole, and Man City really struggled to keep him quiet. If his rate of progression continues I expect him to be in the England picture by the time World Cup 2018 comes around, if not Euro 2016.

Prospect: Nathan Redmond flew down the Norwich wing on more than one occasion on Saturday

Tempted to give it to Ricky van Wolfswinkel who has now scored just once in his 17 appearances. For £8.5m Norwich City expect more, that’s big money for them. 

But it has to go to Stevan Jovetic. He cost £22m and he looks like the kind of striker who might have the occasional brilliant game, but at Carrow Road he looked lazy and languid, and not physically made for a dust-up with the Premier League’s centre-half beasts. He was a poor man’s Dimitar Berbatov. He was taken off, unsurprisingly. Must improve.

Abysmal: City's Stevan Jovetic needs to pull up his socks and prove why they spent so much money on him

Joleon Lescott’s contract is running out and he’s failed to rediscover his title winning form under the new boss; Matija Nastasic has gone backwards; and Demichelis – a genuine Pellegrini signing – is frankly awful. City have one decent centre back, Vincent Kompany. That’s poor squad management.  

If Pellegrini wins the quadruple or a treble then he’s a genius. If he wins a trophy he’s done well in his first season. If he wins nothing with this City squad he’s failed. 

Reliance: Vincent Kompany is the only world class centre defender that City have

Joseph Yobo. 13-and-a-half years after first playing in the Premier League, he slotted in straight away and looked solid at the back for Norwich alongside Sebastien Bassong. He was David Moyes first signing at Everton, and was excellent for the Toffees.

If he continues the form he showed on his Canaries debut then that will be a shrewd signing from Hughton, because defensively they’ve not been great this season.

Solid: Joseph Yobo is back playing in England after a spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce

Chris Hughton may possibly be doing just that. In December 1982, as a 24-year-old full back at Spurs, Hughton was interviewed about his football philosophy. The subsequent article in a football magazine was titled: 'Less Attacking – More Success'.

It seemed to be a philosophy he was pursuing rigidly at Norwich, but without the success bit. But at Cardiff last week (even in defeat) Hughton’s side attacked and created chances. Against Manchester City you’d have been forgiven for thinking he would send his side out to defend. But with Anthony Pilkington, Nathan Redmond and Hooper all starting, it was more 4-3-3 than 4-5-1.

Unfortunate: Gary Hooper thought he had scored for Norwich but it was ruled out for offside

Even when Hooper was injured half way through the second half Hughton resisted any temptation to sit deep, making a like-for-like substitution bringing van Wolfswinkel on.

Hopefully he won’t revert to negative, defensive ways because Norwich were good to watch.Now he just needs to teach his strikers to score.
