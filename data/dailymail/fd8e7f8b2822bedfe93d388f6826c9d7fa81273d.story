Goal hero Christophe Berra said Scotland were rewarded for their patience with a late winner in the 1-0 victory against Northern Ireland.

The Ipswich defender headed home in the 85th minute from a Matt Ritchie corner in the friendly at Hampden Park on Wednesday night.

Berra's goal finally broke the resistance of Northern Ireland and goalkeeper Michael McGovern, who had frustrated Scotland with a succession of saves.

He said: 'It was a difficult game, they made it very difficult. When teams do that it's very hard to break them down.

'Sometimes games are won on set pieces and luckily enough I managed to get my head on the end of a good corner kick and it just sneaked in.'

Scotland boss Gordon Strachan was happy with a win and a clean sheet as preparation for Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar.

Bournemouth star Matt Ritchie, who made his debut in Wednesday night's game, controls the ball in midfield 

He said: 'The start was good, lots of efforts on goals, McGovern played very well but after half an hour it became a friendly feel. But we kept plugging away and doing the right things. And to win the game and keep a clean sheet is good.' 

Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill insisted there more positives than negatives following the narrow defeat.

He said: 'When you make so many substitutions, you are continually changing markers from set-pieces. Under normal circumstances, I don't think we'd have lost that goal - and it's disappointing for Michael McGovern who had a good game.

'We can take an awful lot (from the performance). We ended up with three 20-year-olds or under-20-year-olds on the pitch. The likes of Paddy McNair, Luke McCullough, Ryan McLaughlin - it's great for those lads to get minutes in this type of game.'
