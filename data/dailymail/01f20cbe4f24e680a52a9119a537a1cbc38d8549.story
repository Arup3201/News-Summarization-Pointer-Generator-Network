High Street megastore TK Maxx is famous for its labels for less ethos, and the company's new autumn/winter campaign sets out to prove that being stylish is a state of mind, not an age bracket or a dress size.

Led by 85-year-old supermodel Daphne Selfe the eclectic line-up of UK models and street style stars chosen to showcase the new season offerings also includes Britain’s hottest new plus-size model, Felicity Hayward.

The campaign aims to celebrate individuality and personal style, rather than slavishly following the trends, and the high energy shoot gives the latest in-store bargains a cool new twist.

High Street megastore TK Maxx is famous for its labels for less ethos, and the company's new autumn/winter campaign sets out to prove that looking hot is all about a state of mind, not an age or a dress size

The eclectic line-up of UK models and street style stars chosen to showcase the new season offerings is led by 83-year-old supermodel Daphne Selfe

Silver-haired Daphne has been the star of countless catwalk extravaganzas, campaigns and magazine spreads in a career spanning seven decades.

In the pictures she is seen modelling a mannish trouser suit as well as coral cigarette trousers and a boucle belted coat.

Talking about her style she said: 'I have and wear a lot of vintage clothes and it is how I have always dressed. 
I still have my ‘going away suit’ which I bought in Madrid in the 
‘50’s. It’s thick white brocade cotton and can be put in the washing 
machine. It’s had several ‘updates’ over the years but is still as good 
as ever and I would hate to part with it.

And her top tip for TK Maxx shopping? 'Definitely to go when you are feeling fit and energetic, there's a lot of choice!'

Blonde, beautiful Felicity, 24, has been described as fashion's 'next big thing' and recently featured on the cover of i-D magazine

Felicity said:  'My favourite trend from the TK Maxx autumn collection is winter pastels as I am a big fan of those colours, I could be a little biased on the grounds that I want to be an ice-cream lady when I'm older'

Blonde, beautiful Felicity, 24, has been described as fashion’s ‘next big thing’ 
and recently featured on the cover of i-D magazine.

Vogue magazine decsribed her as a British bombshell 'with plus-size curves worthy of a painting by Reubens, a doll like face and infectiously fun personality that comes with an expected, endearing dirty laugh.'

On the shoot Felicity modelled a block-coloured shift dress worn with a faux fur coat, as well as a pattered dress layered with more faux fur and finished with an oversized clutch.

She said: 'My favourite trend from the TK Maxx autumn collection is winter pastels as I am a big fan of those colours, I 
could be a little biased on the grounds that I want to be an ice-cream lady when I am older and the colours in this trends remind me of all the flavours from mint choc chip to tutti frutti.'

'I would decsribe my style as a modern day Jayne Mansfield, whose wardrobe got mixed up with the costume department of a John Waters movie.

'One of my most treasured possessions is a thong which once belonged to Prince and was worn by one of 
his dancers at the VH1 Fashion Music Awards in 1994. That baby isn’t 
going anywhere.'
