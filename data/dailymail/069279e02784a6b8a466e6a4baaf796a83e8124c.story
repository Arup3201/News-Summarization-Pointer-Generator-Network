A Colorado woman is recovering after being stranded in her car for five days after crashing off a rural highway southwest of Denver

Kristin Hopkins wrote pleas for help on a red-and-white umbrella that she managed to push through a broken window of her crashed car and open, hoping to attract the attention of drivers on a scenic highway above.

Days later, someone spotted the flipped car of the 43-year-old single mother of four children about 80 feet down an embankment in a central Colorado aspen grove.

Found: Kristin Hopkins, a 43-year-old Highlands Ranch woman who had been missing since Tuesday, was found alive in her wrecked car Sunday afternoon

Timely discovery: Hopkins was found in the wreckage of her car by a group of hikers 140 feet below the scenic road she had been traveling on

Missing person: Hopkins was discovered off the Red Hill Pass, near Fairplay in Colorado, USA, on Sunday May 4 after being reported as a missing person by Douglas County Sheriff's Office on April 29

Authorities say at least one motorist 
hiked down from Red Hill Pass on U.S. Highway 285 and alerted 
authorities on Sunday that there was a body inside the car. Rescuers 
found Hopkins alive, conscious and coherent - but critically injured and
 extremely dehydrated.

Hopkins was flown by helicopter to St. Anthony Hospital in suburban Denver, Park County undersheriff Monte Gore said.

She was in critical condition Monday, said hospital spokeswoman Loralee Sturm. Hopkins' family issued a statement saying she will lose both her feet because of injuries sustained in the crash and is expected to survive.

Hopkins drove off the roadway near the old mining town of Fairplay sometime after she was last seen on April 27. The accident occurred beneath a spot overlooking the sprawling ranchlands and surrounding mountains of Colorado's South Park area.

Her 2009 Chevrolet Malibu struck multiple trees and rolled several times before landing on its top.  

Serious condition: Kristin Hopkins was airlifted to hospital where she is being treated for severe dehydration and is in a critical condition

Recovered: Hopkins was found inside her upturned vehicle 140-feet below the 10,051-foot Red Hill Pass - some seven miles north of Fairplay - off U.S. Highway 285

Hopkins had been entered into a statewide police database as a missing person. But since she is an adult and there were no indications of foul play, there was no active search for her.

When rescuers reached the car Sunday, firefighter Jim Cravener asked a colleague to break a window and feel for a pulse.

'He started to break the window and she put her hand up to the window,' Cravener said. 'At that point, it became a rescue.'

Hopkins' notes on the umbrella were hard to make out but appeared to say, "six days, no food, no water; please help me; need a doctor," Cravener said.

'It's really something off that "Shouldn't Be Alive' show,"' he said. 'She really had a strong will to survive.'

Survivor: Rescuers were stunned when they found a dehydrated and critically-injured Kristin Hopkins, 43, in her upturned vehicle 140 feet below the 10,051-foot Red Hill Pass

Pure chance: Emergency crews who rescued Kristin said she had written notes on an umbrella to try and get help, but that the area usually doesn't receive many visitors until fall

Rescuers set to work cutting into the vehicle, pulling out Hopkins and taking her to the helicopter. It was a complicated extrication because of the location, Cravener said.

Hopkins was fairly responsive at first, even telling her rescuers she was not hurt. But they could see her face was badly bruised, possibly by the steering wheel or air bag.

'She didn't talk a whole lot. She started to become less responsive as we carried her down the hill. We had to keep waking her up,' Cravener said.

The area had spring snow storms but not bitterly cold temperatures in the past several days.

Sightseers often stop at the spot but usually in the fall when the leaves are turning color. It was just by chance that somebody would stop at this time of year, Cravener said.

Her family thanked people for their prayers and thoughts.
