Chris Christie has proved he is ready to joke about last autumn's damaging scandal over lane closures on George Washington Bridge after appearing on Jimmy Fallon.

The New Jersey Governor joined The Tonight Show's host in a 'dad dancing' skit poking fun at September's events.

Governor Christie and Fallon had a Father's Day special dance-off called The Evolution of Dad Dancing, dressed in high-waisted khaki trousers and blue golf shirts.

Bridging joke: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and The Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon joke about the George Washington Bridge scandal

Not finding it funny?

After first dancing to moves with names like The Belt Grabber, The Lawn Mower and The Dance at a Springsteen Concert, Fallon introduced The Bridge is Closed – at which point Christy pretended to become upset and walk away.

Fallon also 'apologised' to Governor Christie over a Born To Run cover he performed with Bruce Springsteen on his show in January which mocked the bridge scandal.

Governor Christie, a favourite for Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential elections, also quipped he would beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 if they both 'hypothetically' both won their parties’ nominations - but in a dance off.

The Evolution of Dancing is one of the most popular segments on Jimmy Fallon, which has previously seen Michelle Obama and Will Smith perform dance styles through history with the talk show host.

Chris Christie's appearance on The 
Tonight Show was his first late night talk show appearance since the 
George Washington Bridge scandal broke earlier this year.

Two out of three toll lanes on George Washington Bridge, which connects the New Jersey borough of Fort Lee and Manhattan, were closed from September 9th-13th last autumn.

There had been no warning to emergency services, local officials or the public and it caused severe gridlock and traffic jams in the local area.

Initial reports said the closure was due to a traffic study, but it soon emerged that it had been planned by a member of Chris Christie’s staff and political appointees.

Although never officially confirmed, it is believed the lane closure was an attempt to create animosity against Mark Sokolich, Fort Lee’s Democrat mayor who declined to back Governor Christie in the 2013 gubernatorial election.

So far, four political appointees have resigned over the scandal. Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie's deputy chief of staff, who is believed to have instigated the lane closure, was fired by Christie.

Chris Christie has firmly denied knowing anything about the closures, and later visited Mayor Sokolich to apologise in person.

Governor Christie's appearance on Jimmy Fallon came as officials from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey confirmed the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched an investigation into its operations after the bridge scandal.

New Jersey newspaper The Record reports the Port Authority acknowledged the SEC investigation in a document it released Thursday to prospective buyers of its bonds.

The newspaper says the SEC is looking at the Port Authority's justification for diverting $1.8 billion to pay for New Jersey road repair projects at the urging of Governor Christie's administration.

The document also discloses the agency and related people have received several subpoenas, including from New Jersey federal prosecutors and the Manhattan district attorney's office.

Additional investigations by the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, the New Jersey Legislature, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey are already underway.
