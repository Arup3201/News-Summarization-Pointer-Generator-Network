Betting websites are accessed hundreds of thousands of times a year from parliamentary computers used by MPs, peers and their staff.

In just one month bet365.com was clicked on 16,986 from computers used by members of the Houses of Parliament and their employees.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act showed gambling sites were opened almost 700,000 times - or 1.3 times a minute.

The number of hits gambling websites receive drops during recess at the Houses of Parliament.

Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers' Alliance criticised the amount of time staff spend on gambling websites.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Those in Parliament should spend their time working, not trawling the net for a chance to bet the house.'

MPs, peers and their staff have attempted to access porn websites from their work computers 309,316 times in a year.

The figures were embarrassing for the Prime Minister who has repeatedly spoken out against internet pornography.

And when they're not accessing adult websites, Parliament's workers are clocking up thousands of hours a year on Facebook and online games websites.

Records show computers on the Parliamentary estate access Facebook up to three million times a month â€“ 400 times as often as the BBC News website.

The figures also reveal an extraordinary number of visits to supermarket shopping websites and computer gaming sites and the controversial music downloading site Grooveshark, which is being sued by records labels for alleged copyright offences.

Mr Oxley added although some 'legitimate' use of gambling websites should be expected, these figures were too high.

He said internet misuse by Parliamentary staff should be taken seriously as it is funded by the taxpayer.

It comes after it was revealed by the 
Mail On Sunday this year that a website used by married people to have 
adulterous affairs was accessed up to 289 times a day by Westminster 
staff.

Out Of Town Affairs, which brings together married men and women seeking sex, was clicked on 52,375 times in seven months but has since been banned.

A House of Commons spokeswoman said the gambling figures were not an accurate reflection of the time spent on betting websites as an unknown number may have come from spam.

She told the newspaper: 'These figures are not a reliable guide to the level of usage within the house.'

Parliamentary internet use in monitored.

Previous figures showed Facebook receives 28million hits a year and online games such as FarmVille are clicked on thousands of times a month.
