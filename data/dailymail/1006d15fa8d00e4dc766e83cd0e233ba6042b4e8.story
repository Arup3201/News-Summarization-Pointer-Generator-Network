Yasmin Thomas, 21, attacked Ronnie Lee with broken glass, leaving him with a deep gash just millimetres from his eye

A woman who smashed a broken glass 
into a stranger’s face in a nightclub has been spared jail – despite it 
being her 18th conviction for assault.

Estate
 agent Yasmin Thomas, 21, left her male victim with serious eye injuries
 after she lunged at him with the potentially lethal object.

A court heard she has already been convicted for 17 crimes of assault and battery.

A judge branded Thomas’s criminal history ‘breathtaking’ and one of the worst he had ever seen of a woman her age.

But
 the female thug escaped with a 12-month sentence, suspended for two 
years, and 80 hours community service after pleading guilty to a charge 
of causing actual bodily harm.

She was also ordered to attend anger management classes.

Thomas
 attacked Ronnie Lee, whom she did not know, in Bar So nightclub in 
Bournemouth town centre after a row over an e-cigarette.

Thomas’s friend had snatched it from a friend of Mr Lee, and had thrown it on the floor.

Thomas
 then picked it up and thrust the device at Mr Lee, demanding: ‘Are you 
not going to say thank you? Who do you think you are?’

She then lunged towards Mr Lee with a broken glass, causing a serious gash to his left eyelid and two smaller cuts to his face.

The
 injuries were so close to his eye that Mr Lee feared he would lose his 
sight.

Tiny shards of glass were later removed from his eye.

Prosecuting,
 Carolyn Branford-Wood told Bournemouth Crown Court: ‘Miss Thomas, with a
 glass in her hand, lunged towards Mr Lee, who felt a blow to his left 
eye and blood trickling down his face.’

The court was told that Mr Lee was ‘very lucky’ not to have suffered any permanent damage following the brutal attack.

Miss
 Branford-Wood said  doctors initially feared he had suffered a 
fractured eye socket following the assault, which also left him needing 
stitches to the cut on his eyelid.

Thomas,
 who lives in Bournemouth, worked as a sales negotiator at Palmer Snell 
estate agency. Yesterday the company refused to confirm whether Thomas 
was still employed.

In 
mitigation, Audrey Archer said Thomas had been diagnosed with an 
emotionally unstable personality disorder and had struggled to manage 
her temper from childhood.

She
 said she had sought help from mental health services prior to 
committing this offence and was waiting to undergo cognitive analytical 
therapy.

Mrs Archer added that Thomas was trying to turn her life 
around and, prior to the attack, her last offence was committed in 
2010.

Thomas was also 
ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge and £1,000 in compensation to Mr 
Lee.

Thomas has a record of violence which includes 17 previous convictions for assault

Sentencing her, judge John Harrow said: ‘You have a breathtaking 
record of violence, one of the worst I have ever seen from anyone your 
age.

‘It is not without a 
lot of hesitation and some reservations, I must confess, that I’m going 
to suspend that 12 month sentence for two years.’

He
 added: ‘Any offence at all will be sent back to this court and you will
 go straight down those steps to prison for at least 12 months.’

Yesterday
 residents of Bournemouth questioned the judge’s decision.

One wrote 
online: ‘So what do you actually have to do to go to prison these days?’

Another comment read: ‘It’s barbaric that she has avoided jail.

'She is a danger to the public and disgrace to society.’

Last
 night Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, said: ‘I am
 particularly concerned that the judge mentioned that he suspended 
[Thomas’s] sentence with ‘a lot of hesitation and some reservations’.

'He
 was clearly troubled by her record.’ 

Mr
 Ellwood, who was himself the target of a violent attack after he 
reprimanded a group of youths, added: ‘This is now the third case of 
this nature that I have seen in Bournemouth in recent months.

'So I will 
now be seeking a meeting with the Attorney General to discuss these 
particular cases and to ask whether changes to the law are necessary to 
ensure that cases of this kind do not occur again.’

Dorset
 police, the Crown Prosecution Service and Bournemouth Crown Court all 
refused to disclose details of Thomas’s previous convictions, all of 
which occurred when she was under 18.
