A worshiper found his prayers for financial security were answered at Jerusalem's sacred Western Wall.

The man discovered an envelope containing $500m of cheques stuffed into one of its cracks of the holy landmark.

The iconic wall in Israel's capital has for centuries been a focal point for worshipers of numerous religions, who tuck slips of paper with prayers written on them into the historic structure.

The envelope, discovered on Wednesday, was filled with more than 500 signed cheques - some written for $1m.

Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who oversees the wall, said most of them were Nigerian, with some from Europe, Asia and the United States.

But the cheques were not addressed to anyone and would most likely bounce if someone attempted to cash them in.

The worshiper handed the envelope to police, via a lawyer. Officers are investigating whether the cheques are forgeries.

Rabbi Rabinowitch said he has found cheques, mainly written by worshipers from Africa, in the wall's charity box before, but all them bounced.

He told New York Daily News he believes who ever left the $500m of cheques was well intentioned and thinks he 'wanted to give all they had to the creator of the universe.'

The Western Wall is located in Jerusalem's Old City at the Temple Mount and is one of the most sacred sites in Judaism.

It is part of an ancient wall which surrounded the Temple's courtyard and is believed to have been built in 19BC, with much of structure now lying below street level.
