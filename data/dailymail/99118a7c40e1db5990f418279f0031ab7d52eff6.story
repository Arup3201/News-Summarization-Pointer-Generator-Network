A carer who stole nearly £10,000 to go on a spending spree including clothes, shoes and handbags was jailed yesterday.

Laura Nichols, 26, sobbed as she was sent to prison for plundering the life savings of a vulnerable man she was meant to be looking after.

Nichols was team leader for a care company, but also worked as a barmaid to help pay for her love of fashion.

A court heard that she stole £9,831.99 over a year from the man’s bank account.

Theft: Laura Nichols, 26, of Houghton, Pembrokeshire, plundered the bank account of a vulnerable 41-year-old man she was looking after while working as a team leader for a care company

Alongside her job as a carer, Nichols worked as a barmaid to help pay for her love of fashion

Ellie Morgan, prosecuting, said: ‘Police found clothes, shoes and handbags at her parents’ house.

‘Nichols said she had bought them herself, but admitted supplementing her account with the stolen money.

‘When interviewed, Nichols told police she used the money for bills and loan repayments.’

Her victim, 41, could not manage his own finances and received 24-hour care at his home in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire.

Nichols had full control of his finances because he could not remember his pin number to use a cash machine.

The court heard large sums had been withdrawn across Pembrokeshire and in Cardiff.

Magistrates
 at Haverfordwest were told withdrawals were also made when the victim 
was visiting his parents in France. She even transferred the man’s ISA 
into a current account to get access to it.

Nichols admitted stealing from the bank account ‘40 or 50 times.’

She
 got away with almost £10,000 before a colleague at Elliots Hill Care 
Ltd temporarily took over her duties and realised what had been 
happening.

Jailed: Nichols was sent to prison for eight months after stealing £9,831.99 over a year-long period from the man’s bank account. She spent the money on her love of fashionable clothes, shoes and handbags

Geraint Walters, 
the barrister representing Nichols, said: ‘She found herself living 
beyond her means.’ Mr Recorder Ian Wyn Lloyd Jones, sitting at Swansea 
Crown Court, told her he would not be doing his job if he suspended the 
sentence and jailed her for eight months.

He
 said: ‘You were working for a company caring for vulnerable adults. On 
dozens of occasions you helped yourself to the victim’s money.

‘This was repeated offending by someone in a position of trust. You were there to look after him, not to take his money.’
