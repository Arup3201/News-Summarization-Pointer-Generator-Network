Former SBS Dateline presenter Anjali Rao has broken her silence about why she quit her role hosting the respected current affairs show saying she needed a new challenge, but fears she may struggle to land a 'dream' role because of her distinctive British accent. 

Rao also told Daily Mail Australia rumours she left the show because of cuts announced to the ABC and SBS were untrue, but said: 'I might be doing them a favour by leaving'.

The 40-year-old enjoyed a successful six-year stint at CNN International in Hong Kong but the lure of working in her homeland proved too much in early 2013 and she signed with SBS to host Dateline.

But now, almost two years later, she believes another  challenge beckons.

'I am up for any broadcaster, commercial or public,' she told Daily Mail Australia, while  admitting there may be a problem with that plan.

'I am not going to deny that there have been issues surrounding my accent and I cannot say that I have experienced this at any time, anywhere in any country other than since moving to this country and this is my country, so it's been a little difficult,' she said.

How the popular presenter made her decision known on social media

Presenter and journalist Anjali Rao has quit after two years as host of SBS program Dateline and is seeking a new 'high octane' challenge in Australian TV

'I get told on a multiple times, daily basis, "oh my God, we love your accent" where's that from and ordinary people love it which is great, fantastic.

'I went to boarding school in the UK which is what did this to my accent but people say to me "when can you get back on TV because it's so distinctive we automatically know it's you, if we are not even watching or preparing the dinner or whatever, we know it's you" and I think that is a really valuable thing.

'It means a huge amount to me as well because I am very proud of my accent. I would hope that it is not an obstacle also given my experience in this industry.

'One would hope that a silly little thing like my accent is not going to stand in the way of great things.

'I moved here for new opportunities and those are the sorts of things I want to now investigate.

'I love this country, I am half Australian, my mother is from Bendigo and my passport is Australian, it always has been, despite my accent.

'I am committed to staying here and I have a five year old son who lives here, I will be staying here.'

'I love this this country, I am half Australian, my mother is from Bendigo and my passport is Australian' 

Anjali Rao said that 'I had always planned at about this time, I have been incredibly fortunate to have hosted Dateline for the past two years it has just been an absolute privilege to work with these people'

Hard news reporting and once-a-week programs behind her, Anjali Rao's eyes are now firmly fixed on in-depth interviewing roles.

'I had always planned (to resign) about this time, I have been incredibly fortunate to have hosted Dateline for the past two years it has just been an absolute privilege to work with these people.

'For me, I realised that I wanted something more. Dateline is just once a week and I come from a breaking news background, six years doing breaking news at CNN and prior to that breaking news at Sky News in London. So I come from a very high octane environment and I just wanted a bit more of that, I felt like as far as hosting Dateline was concerned I had done pretty much all that I could do.'

The spectre of cutbacks didn't help, she admitted. 

'I can't deny that when you see the writing on the wall with something like this, it certainly hurried things up in my mind.

'More than that, it just cemented what I was feeling was the right thing to do, that was to step down and you know if budget cuts are part of it then I might be doing them a favour by quitting.'

Rao says of the imminent cutbacks at the public broadcaster that she feels sad for 'those wonderful people who are now going to be on the job-hunt I guess but they are such good journalists that I have absolutely no doubt they will go onto fabulous things'

She leaves with a heavy heart, aware her colleagues face an uncertain future.

'I was always very sad of just myself leaving because I thought I won't get to see these fantastic people as often any more. That already made me sad but now with the sort of snowball-effect of what has happened, of course, I do feel a bit gutted.

'I do feel particularly sad for those wonderful people who are now going to be on the job-hunt I guess but they are such good journalists that I have absolutely no doubt they will go onto fabulous things.'

She is proud at what the show achieved with her in the hot seat.

'The idea that we were actually hitting a quarter of a million in audience figures on a very frequent weekly basis shows there is a significant appetite for what we were serving up, which is incredibly encouraging.

'Then again if management saw something to which we are not privy to, in that the format was not working any more for whatever reason, they are totally within their rights to go ahead and change that format, there is nothing anyone can do, it is the nature of the industry.

When she once was the face and voice of CNN International. Anjali Rao spent six years at the broadcaster in Hong Kong, fronting breakfast and talk shows

'I have had 18 years of hard news but what I was best known for at CNN were two shows, my daily prime-time breakfast and also my weekly talk show, "Talk Asia" and that is the style of thing of what I would like to get back into.

'Meeting people, famous or otherwise and just finding out about their lives and what makes them who they are. Anybody who has got a story, that's essentially what I am into, more like psychological journalism.

'I've done enough of the hard news I want to get into the interviewing one-on-one, finding real slice of life stories, that's absolutely where my passion lies.'

And as for future television bosses who may need a little more convincing about just how Australian she really is, Anjali Rao concluded by saying 'I do speak fluent Bendigoian'.
