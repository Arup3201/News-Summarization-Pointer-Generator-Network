A Texas nine-year-old's family plan to move out of the state if she can't be medicated with cannabis for her seizures. 

Alexis Bortell's seizures strike about twice a week, and though they're non-violent, they are still serious and other drugs don't seem to help. 

Alexis, from Rowlett, Texas, is unable to ride a bike or sleep over at friends' houses because adults who can administer her emergency relief medicine must always be present in case she has an episode.

Alexis Bortell, 9, is fighting to legalize cannabis oil in Texas. She has the backing of a State Senator and State Representative who have bills that they hope to get to committee. If they reach committee, Alexis will testify 

Alexis's story has attracted attention across Texas as two Republican lawmakers in Texas introduced bills to approve the legalization of medical marijuana in the form of cannabis oil

Alexis has been given a number of drugs in an attempt to reduce episodes, but they gave her side effects including tremors, spasms and personality changes, and the seizures still remained, according to the National Monitor.

Her family relies on emergency relief medicine that is administered after she has a seizure.

But Alexis and her family believe cannabis - which is illegal in Texas - just might help reduce her seizures. 

Her story has attracted attention across the state as two Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would approve the legalization of medical marijuana in the form of cannabis oil, according to WFAA. 

'Medical cannabis will help me. It's illegal in Texas and we're trying to change that,' Alexis said.

The bills are sponsored by Republican State Sen. Kevin Eltife and Republican State Rep. Stephanie Klick. 

If their bill for cannabis oil is passed in its original form, the use of the substance will be regulated by the Texas Department of Public Safety instead of the Department of State Health Services. 

Dean Bortell, Alexis's father, said that he is unsure if the cannabis oil will work, but he feels like he's failed her, knowing there's something out there that could help the seizures that they can't get access to because of their ZIP code.

Bortell, a conservative Christian, said that the family will move to Colorado if the bill is not passed in May. 

Since Alexis already has a card that will allow her to obtain cannabis oil in Colorado, Bortell told WFAA that they plan to begin treating Alexis in late June. 

Alexis has yet to try cannabis oil because her father is worried that she might get tested by the Texas Department of Protective Services because she has a high-profile position on the issue. 

She plans to explain her experiences and seizures before lawmakers if the bills reach policy committee.

Regardless of the decision made in May, the Bortell family plans to continue to push for the legalization of cannabis.
