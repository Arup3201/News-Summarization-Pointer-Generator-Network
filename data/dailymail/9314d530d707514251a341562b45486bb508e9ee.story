Paul Conibeer, who spent 300 days behind bars with the Bali Nine ringleaders, finds it unbearable to think about what his good mates are going through at the dreaded news they will be executed.

Conibeer, a New Zealander who has permanent residency in Australia, developed a special bond with Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran over the 10 months he spent in Bali's infamous Kerobokan jail until he was released on June 24, 2013.

The 46-year-old was instantly embraced and treated like a brother by the reformed drug smugglers and can not imagine having to endure his sentence without their constant love and support.

Paul Conibeer spent 300 days behind bars with the Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran

The pair had already been calling the prison their home for seven years after plotting to smuggle 8kg of heroin into Australia a decade ago when Conibeer arrived - but they received the news they had been dreading on Wednesday when the final appeal to spare their lives was rejected by the Indonesian courts.

'Hearing the footsteps at night would frighten the hell out of them - it would be a haunting feeling - how could they sleep properly at night? ' he said of living in the confined cells he knows too well.

Conibeer quit his job as a car salesman in 2012 and headed off on a solo three-month overseas adventure which quickly turned into the holiday from hell.

The trouble started around August 27 on a night out in Kuta, Bali's popular party district, when he had his wallet and a phone pickpocketed outside a nightclub.

When Conibeer explained to the hotel staff that he could not pay his bill they took him to the police station to report the incident when found himself handcuffed. 

After refusing to pay a bribe, he was locked in a cell at the station where he slept on a tiled floor for 60 days.

Following the two months with 13 inmates who didn't speak English, ironically, Conibeer couldn't wait to move into Bali's most notorious jail where he was met by Sukumaran and another Bali Nine member, Matthew Norman.

'They met me at the front door because they had heard through a friend that I was coming,' he said.

'I didn't know what to expect when the big doors opened and they welcomed me straight away saying "we'll come and get you tomorrow morning and tell you what to do and what not to do''.'

It was couple of days later that Conibeer was greeted by a smiling and energetic Chan. 

'He gives 100 per cent everyday - I don't know how he does it with a death sentence hanging over his head,' he said.

'He's so full of life - positive is the best way to describe him - he just has this aurora that makes you smile and feel happy.'

Conibeer, who has released the book 'I Surivived Kerobokan' about his traumatic ordeal, said Sukumaran is the polar opposite to his best mate.

'Andrew only has one gear which is straight forward while Myu is idle,' Conibeer said.

'I call him The Thinker - he drifts off and can be distant which is fine because you need people to have time by themselves in a place like that.'

Helping Sukumaran run the boxing classes was Conibeer's saving grace throughout his imprisonment 

Sukumaran and Chan are known for transforming the lives of prisoners at what is dubbed 'Hotel K' including organising boxing, cooking, computer, art and bible classes.

Helping Sukumaran run the boxing classes was Conibeer's saving grace throughout his imprisonment.

'I had a lot of respect from the Indonesians I was training,' he said.

'The gang members would rock up to do boxing so that way they weren't as likely to kill me - plus I didn't take drugs or owe anyone money.'

He was angered that Sukumaran and Chan were now facing a death sentence despite transforming their lives and remaining sober throughout the past decade.

'How can you put someone on death row when the prison is full of drugs?,' he said. 'It's hypocritical and double standards.'

'I know they don't use (drugs) but lots of Aussies who have been in there have.

'They don't want a reduced sentence - they just want to live.' 

Conibeer said he was 'gutted' when he heard that their appeal for presidential clemency was denied.

'I was stopped in my tracks and thought "don't they see what they've done for other inmates?" he said.

Despite the harsh conditions, Conibeer was conflicted about leaving his good mates behind

It was so difficult to bid farewell to his close mates that in some way Conibeer wanted to remain living in that harsh world without freedom.

'It was the worst - I said goodbye to Myu in the morning and then Andrew walked me to the door in the afternoon,' he said.

'I will never forget the hug Andrew gave me - it was so strong and I really felt that bond between us - all of these emotions were going through me.'

He sent a message to Chan about a week ago through a friend of the Bali Nine members who visits them regularly.

'I told him "I haven't stopped thinking about you and I love you as a mate" and he replied with "thanks for your thoughts".'

'The friend said he was in surprisingly good spirits - that's the type of guy he is.' 

Conibeer was speechless when asked what he would say if he had the opportunity to say goodbye to his dear friends in person.

'I don't think would be able to get a word out - I would just break down and cry.'
