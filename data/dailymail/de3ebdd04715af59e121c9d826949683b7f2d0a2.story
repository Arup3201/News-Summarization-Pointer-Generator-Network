He was ridiculed by opposition MPs for making the unprecedented move of setting out an alternative plan to the Chancellor’s Budget in the House of Commons.

And now Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury Chief Secretary, has been mocked for a subsequent photo opportunity yesterday holding a yellow briefcase.

The stunt saw the box – which was auctioned off to a Lib Dem activist for £1,500 - held outside the Treasury building in an echo of George Osborne outside 11 Downing Street on Wednesday.

SpongeBob SquarePants and Trunki: Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Treasury Chief Secretary, has been mocked for a photo opportunity yesterday holding a yellow briefcase for the 'alternative budget'

PlayStation and Meccano: Social media users were quick to post mocked-up images of 42-year-old Mr Alexander standing with other yellow boxes, including the above two examples

But social media users were quick to post mocked-up images of Mr Alexander, 42, standing with other yellow boxes - including a SpongeBob SquarePants lunchbox and a Trunki ride-on suitcase.

Other photographs showed the politician holding a PlayStation, Meccano set and posing with ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond playing football and Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe falling over.

Yesterday, Mr Alexander was harangued by Labour backbenchers and faced accusations that he was abusing his ministerial office as he set out the plan for those ‘left cold’ by Mr Osborne's Budget.

Despite confirming that the Budget was agreed by the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Alexander criticised the plans in it to cut government spending to 1964 levels - ‘the era of Cathy Come Home’.

Prior to Mr Alexander's comments, Speaker John Bercow insisted that such statements ‘have to be ministerial, delivered not in a personal or party capacity but on behalf of the Government’.

But as the Treasury Chief Secretary set out his Lib Dem plan that ‘borrows less than Labour’ and ‘cuts less than the Conservatives’, he was met with a volley of heckling from Labour backbenchers.

Shouts of ‘this is an abuse of office’ and ‘this is ridiculous’ could be heard as Opposition MPs and others waved the coalition Budget document.

At one point, Labour frontbencher Andrew Gwynne reached across the table separating the despatch boxes with a copy of the red book and dropped it in front of Mr Alexander.

Mr Alexander insisted his statement was ‘entirely legitimate’ because the plans were in a Treasury document, but deviated from the Tories' ‘cuts for cuts' sake’ and Labour's ‘dragging out the pain’.

He said: ‘They may not like it but I'm setting out the numbers in the Treasury document published today, which is an entirely legitimate thing to do.’

The Treasury Chief Secretary outlined Lib Dems plans to achieve the £30billion of savings needed to eliminate the structural current deficit through a combination of tax rises, tackling tax avoidance, departmental cuts and welfare savings.

Mr Alexander's plans would mean significantly less welfare cuts than under the Tories but also introduce tax rises which the senior coalition partners have not set out.
