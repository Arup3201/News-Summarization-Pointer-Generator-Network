CLICK HERE to catch up on all the stats from the big game, including the patient build up to Raheem Sterling's strike 

They played with pace, subtlety and panache. At times they threatened to overwhelm the opposition. And some of their football was a delight to behold. But, no, it was not the team of Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Steven Gerrard that so pleased the eye at Upton Park.

Rather it was Sam Allardyce’s West Ham. At times they looked scintillating. Granted, the opening ten minutes of the game was the period in which they were most devastating. And they had to endure a more uncomfortable second half when Liverpool, after a change of formation, finally hit their stride.

But when, on 88 minutes, Stewart Downing found Morgan Amalfitano and the Frenchman, on his home debut, simply prodded the ball past Simon Mignolet to seal the victory it felt like a fitting finale.

Ratings by Sami Mokbel at Upton Park

Alex Song had just been named man of the match and it was as though every signing made this summer was playing his part.

In Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate, Allardyce has assembled a front-three with enough speed and craft to thrill home supporters, who for so long have shown discontent with the attacking verve of their team.

In playing Downing behind those three, Allardyce has added guile to his line-up and rejuvenated the man best known for his ability on wing. The manager has remodelled West Ham. They are, as Liverpool discovered, an entirely different proposition to last season.

The Hammers, without a home win this season and cast as the perennial ugly sisters at the Premier League Ball, started with such verve and incision that it seemed even to surprise themselves. Certainly Allardyce will have been purring.

Asked to employ an attacking coach and with a chairman, in David Sullivan, who used his programme column to remark favourably on how many more passes the team are now making, the manager bears the inferences with seemingly good grace. So to see his side tearing apart the darlings of last season in those opening exchanges must have been particularly satisfying.

Downing was at the heart of most of it, playing centrally, just behind Sakho and causing Liverpool a host of problems. The first came after just two minutes, Downing’s delightful inswinging free-kick inducing panic in the Liverpool back four. Goalkeeper Simon Mignolet failed to come and no defender dealt with it so James Tomkins headed it back across goal for Winston Reid to nod over the line.

Upton Park erupted but the excitement had yet to reach its peak. Just five minutes later, the home side worked the ball crisply to Sakho on the right. The Senegal forward sprinted away, took a touch and then simply dinked the most delightful of chips over Mignolet. Now the stadium truly roared.

The Belgian keeper looked exposed on both goals but recovered enough to push away Aaron Cresswell’s shot on 13 minutes while Adrian incurred the wrath of Mark Noble when he kicked out at Mario Balotelli after the Italian had made a late challenge on the goalkeeper. Both Balotelli and Adrian were cautioned, the Spaniard fortunate not to have been handed a more severe punishment by referee Craig Pawson.

Liverpool looked increasingly shambolic and manager Brendan Rodgers intervened, making a 25th-minute switch to a back three by taking off right-back Javier Manquillo for centre half Mamadou Sakho.

It sparked a reaction as Liverpool had a brief period in which they established some midfield control and within that they scored. Balotelli somehow brought down a cross that seemed beyond him and, though the Italian forward’s shot was deflected away, Sterling followed up to hit a superb strike past Adrian with Valencia failing to track his man.

Yet it was a brief respite for Liverpool and West Ham continued to threaten. Valencia had two further chances to restore a two-goal advantage and Mignolet needed to be alert to parry away the danger. As it was, Liverpool would have been relieved to regroup at half time just the one goal down.

Rodgers brought on a summer signing of his own in Adam Lallana at half time to play behind the front two for another change of shape, this time more subtle. And amid the steady east London drizzle Liverpool finally began to demonstrate some genuine attacking creativity.

Sterling was starting to find space in which to run at defenders and Balotelli at last got a chance to show some of his undoubted quality: a curling, crossfield ball on 53 minutes, nicely weighted to run into the path of Fabio Borini, was one such moment. Borini opted for a shot, which Adrian saved comfortably, when he might have pulled the ball back for oncoming team-mates.

Then, in the 59th minute Balotelli curled a shot at Adrian which the Spaniard saved.

Borini’s strike on 64 minutes caught a deflection and almost wrong-footed Adrian, the goalkeeper scrambling to recover as he failed to take the ball. He did so, but with his foot up, managed to take out a late arriving Borini as well.

West Ham, with Valencia, Sakho and Kouyate offering genuine pace and attacking intent, remained a considerable threat, Sakho shooting just over on 69 minutes. But Liverpool’s back three were much more alive to the threat than previously as the midfield in front of them slowly established some dominance.

West Ham’s attacking threat never disappeared, however, and it was fitting that the home side ended the match as they started it by putting the ball into stunned Liverpool’s net.
