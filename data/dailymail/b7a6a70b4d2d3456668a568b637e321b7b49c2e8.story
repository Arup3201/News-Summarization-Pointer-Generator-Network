This is the heartbreaking moment a dog desperately chased after the owner who abandoned it at a gas station on the side of a Louisiana road.

A witness snapped the photograph after she saw a man drop off the dog on Highway 11 in Slidell. She said the owner yelled at his pet to 'Go! Go over there!'

Lorie Hollis said the dog, a black German shepherd mix, was confused and jumped up, putting his paws on the tailgate of the man's pickup truck. 

This is the heartbreaking moment a German shepherd desperately chased after the owner who abandoned it at a gas station on the side of a road in Slidell, Louisiana 

The dog then gave chase after the truck sped off, trying desperately to keep up. 

Hollis told the Louisiana Humane Society that she got into her car and tried to follow the dog and truck, watching the shepherd cross two lanes of traffic as it attempted to reach its owner. 

But after driving for a couple of miles, Hollis lost sight of them both. 

'My heart is broken,' she told WDSU. 'I am in shock that someone would treat a dog like this.' 

A spokesman for the Humane Society said it is all too common for dogs to be abandoned and 'left to fend for themselves' on the sides of highways or back country roads. 

'People can be cruel and heartless,' Jeff Dorson told WDSU. 'If people feel they can no longer care for a pet, all they have to do is surrender him or her to a nearby rescue group or shelter.' 

Dorson said when animals are abandoned in a 'random location' they have 'almost zero' chance of survival. 

'This is truly a cowardly act and a punishable offense,' he added. 

The Humane Society of Louisiana said they will accept custody of the German shepherd and find it a home when it is  returned.

They are also offering a $250 reward for any information that could lead to the owner's arrest or his abandoned dog's safe return.
