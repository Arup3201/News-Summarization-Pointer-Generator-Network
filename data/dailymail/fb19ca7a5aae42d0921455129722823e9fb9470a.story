Britain's contributions to the European Union have doubled in five years, even before the latest demand for an extra £1.7billion, it has emerged.

After billions have been paid into Brussels coffers - and some returned through the rebate and EU spending programmes - the UK was £8.6billion in 2013, up from just £4.3billion in 2009.

It comes as UK ministers launch a fresh attempt to persuade other member states to tear up the £1.7billion bill which David Cameron has refused to pay by December 1.

Figures dating back to 2007 show how the UK's net contribution has risen dramatically in recent years

The British government has been stunned by the demand, which emerged a week ago.

The European Commission used rules dating back to 1995 and found Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels.

To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling.

However, payments dating back to 2007 show how the payments to the European project have been quietly rising.

A major cause has been Tony Blair's decision to agree to a 7 per cut in the rebate during negotiations on the last seven-year budget deal. It cost Britain £7billion over seven years.

Margaret Thatcher famously secured the rebate in 1984 by banging the table and demanding 'our own money back' during a summit with European leaders in Fontainebleau, in France.

However, the rebate has fallen from £5.4billion in 2009 to only £3.3billion in 2013, figures published by the FT show. At the same time total payments from the UK have risen from £14.1billion to £17.2billion.

The revelation will pile pressure on Prime Minister David Cameron, who was in Downing Street with actress Barbara Windsor today to mark Poppy Day in London

Even allowing for £5.2billion of EU spending in the UK, on farming, fisheries and regeneration, the UK was still £8.6billion worse off last year.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage told MailOnline: 'Thank you Mr Blair for sacrificing a large chunk of the British rebate in return for absolutely nothing.

'Much of the money that has come back to Britain has been used to make rich landowners richer (through the Common Agriculture Policy).

'The question is no longer can we afford to leave, it is can we afford to stay.'

Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of Business for Britain, said: 'We've been pouring more and more money into the EU every year, only to see far too much of it squandered. 

'Tony Blair threw away much of our rebate in return for empty promises of reform that never materialised. It's about time Brussels curbed its spending, rather than making extra demands on the UK because our economy is growing.'

A new poll today showed there had been a sharp shift in public opinion about the EYU in the wake of the latest demand for more money.

YouGov found a week ago that only 40 per cent of people would vote to leave the EU, with 41 per cent wanting to stay.

But now 44 per cent say they would leave, with only 35 per cent wanting to stay.

Nick Clegg travelled to Paris today for talks with the French prime minister to seek support for renegotiating the EU's demand for £1.7 billion in additional funding. 

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today insisted the government would 'scrub' the EU's figures to examine how the £1.2billion figure was calculated

In the wake of the row over the £1.7billion bill, there has been a sharp rise in support for leaving the EU, according to a new poll by YouGov

Britain faces the biggest increase to its payments covering the last four years. The UK is being asked for an extra €2.1billion euros.

Preliminary figures show that the Netherlands will have to pay an extra €642million (£506million), while Germany will receive a rebate of €779million (£614million), France €1billion (£790million) and Poland €316million (£250million).

Mr Clegg warned Manuel Valls that, while France is a winner from the current round of readjustments to national contributions, it could find itself targeted with a massive bill through the 'arbitrary and random' process in future.

Speaking ahead of the meeting in Paris, Mr Clegg said that the UK will 'scrub these figures very, very hard' - including an analysis of any impact on the UK's £3 billion-a-year EU rebate - and pledged: 'We will make sure that it is lower.'

France is the biggest gainer from the recalculation of national contributions to EU budgets, and is due to receive one billion euro (£800million), while EU partners including the Netherlands, Italy, Greece and Malta face surcharges

Chancellor George Osborne last night insisted he is 'confident' of securing changes to the figures, which shocked David Cameron when they emerged during a European Council summit in Brussels last week.

New figures reveal the increased bill the UK faces, on top of the £8billion-a-year it already pays, is higher than any other EU country, because its economy has been growing faster than expected. France, Germany and Denmark are among those told they will get money back from Brussels

After talks with fellow EU finance ministers on the fringe of an OECD forum in Berlin, Mr Osborne said Italy and the Netherlands were 'allies' in the drive to review the figures.

Mr Cameron has insisted the UK will not pay 'anything like' the amount being demanded, and secured agreement at the European Council for the issue to be discussed at a scheduled meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels on November 7.

Mr Clegg told LBC Radio that he and the Prime Minister were 'as one' on the issue.

'We are not going to pay this money by the December 1 deadline that has been set,' said the Deputy Prime Minister.

'It is a completely arbitrary, random way to behave to suddenly have this bill dropped into your lap without any warning and without any explanation.;'

Mr Clegg said the UK needed to 'build alliances' to challenge the European Commission demands, adding: 'We are not going to pay this money. It is not a way to do these things. It is not just a British problem, it is a European problem.

'If it is Britain in the spotlight today, it could be France or Germany next time.'

He added: 'We want to have a really close look at this and see what the retrospective effect is. We want to see what the effect is on the UK rebate. We are not going to pay it by that deadline, no matter what they say elsewhere.'
