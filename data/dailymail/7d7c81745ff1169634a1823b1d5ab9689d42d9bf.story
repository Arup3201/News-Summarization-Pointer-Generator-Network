You don't have to fly to some swanky Caribbean island owned by a millionaire if you fancy sipping a cocktail while being styled by a top designer next week.

The man who styles Benedict Cumberbatch, P.Diddy, Alex Turner, David Gandy and Jason Statham is bringing his design credentials to Leicester Square hotel W London.

High up on the hotel’s seventh floor with
 a bird’s eye view of Leicester Square, in the city’s most stylish hotel
 suite - The Spencer Hart Suite - guests can be dressed by designer du jour Nick Hart and the Spencer Hart team.

The hotel is launching its personal styling service during the capital’s three-day menswear fashion event, offering guests personal styling and shopping sessions.

The Suite will be open from June 16-17 to reveal the SS15 Palm Springs collection and two new footwear ranges, in the luxurious surroundings of the hotel’s EWOW Suite.

Visitors will be served bespoke Palm Springs-inspired cocktails, created by W London’s team of mixologists.

'The SS15 Spencer Hart Palm Springs collection is wholly inspired by the Californian desert resort city in its heyday,' says Nick Hart, creative director of Spencer Hart.

'There is a very clear connection between Palm Springs and Savile Row and that’s a meticulous attention to detail in the quest to create something of clean, bright beauty.

'For me, The Spencer Hart Suite will represent a little corner of Palm Springs in London - hidden, exclusive and utterly glamorous.'

Nick Hart and his team have created a modern adaptation of this time and its Ratpack cast, using modern shapes and fabrics and taking inspiration from a cast of current day muses including Downton Abbey actor Dan Stevens and modern day Sherlock Holmes, Benedict Cumberbatch.

The W hotel on Wardour Street opened three years ago and has 192 rooms, including the EWOW penthouse high in the sky over central London.
