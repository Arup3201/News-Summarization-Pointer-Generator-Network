A 91-year-old driver crashed her vintage Bentley into a wall at a petrol station after mistaking the accelerator for the brake.

The elderly driver suffered cuts to her face and had to be taken to hospital following the accident, just yards from her Bournemouth home.

The bonnet of the classic car was crumpled into the wall as a result of the impact.

An eye-witness described hearing a 'loud bang' and said it is thought the driver mistook the pedals, hitting the accelerator instead of the brake after filling up the automatic car.

The elderly woman crashed the vintage Bentley after filling up the car at the pump

The bonnet of the classic car crumpled into the wall directly opposite the petrol pumps at the garage, which is next to the driver's home

The car crashed into the wall directly in front of the pump and underneath a sign which reads, 'a happy car is a clean car'.

The driver was taken to hospital having suffered cuts to her face, which required stitches.

Meanwhile her car was taken to a nearby garage for repairs.

Gunasekaran Periasamy, who works at the garage at Bear Cross in Bournemouth, Dorset, said: 'I was behind the counter when I heard a loud bang.

'I went outside and saw the Bentley crashed into the wall. The lady had been filling up at the pump and she must have pressed the wrong pedal.

'My first concern was for the driver. The car door was very difficult to get open but with the help of a customer we managed to get it open.

'Thankfully the woman was not badly hurt.'
