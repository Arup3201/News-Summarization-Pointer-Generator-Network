California Chrome, the 2014 Kentucky Derby winner who finished second to Prince Bishop in Saturday’s Dubai World Cup, has been confirmed as a definite runner at Royal Ascot in June.

The four-year-old, trained by Art Sherman, has the 10-furlong Prince Of Wales’s Stakes on June 17 in his sights but could first take in the one-mile Lockinge Stakes at Newbury on May 16.

California Chrome will be based at Rae Guest’s stable in Newmarket during his stay here.

Co-owner Perry Martin said: ‘We are grateful for the opportunity to race at Royal Ascot and hopeful that California Chrome can put up a good show. We are looking forward to the experience.’

Further overseas interest in the Prince Of Wales’s Stakes could be supplied by Japan’s Spielberg, a Grade One winner on his home turf and third in the Japan Cup in November.

The news of California Chrome’s British venture emerged hours before Newmarket trainer Roger Varian confirmed that his 2014 St Leger winner and Arc fourth Kingston Hill will miss the first half of the season.

Races like the Coronation Cup at Epsom and the King George at Ascot had been expected to be on Kingston Hill’s agenda.

Varian said: ‘He has sustained a superficial injury to his left fore. He is sound but sore. He has an area of significant bruising and inflammation which will take time to settle.

‘We will now target the top middle distance races later in the season with all roads leading back to Longchamp in October for a another crack at the Prix de l’ Arc De Triomphe.’
