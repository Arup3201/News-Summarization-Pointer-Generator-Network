A seven-year-old boy has been left 'numb' after his Christmas was ruined by thieves who stole the brand new BMX his mother hasn't even paid for yet.

Ryan Rose had only ridden the bike once before it was snatched from a communal area at his Trident Close home in Erdington, Birmingham.

Single mum Corina Barratt, 45, said her son had been left devastated by the theft of the £180 Zinc Echo, which she had bought on credit.

Ryan Rose left his bike in the communal hallway to his flat, pictured, and it disappeared before he had a chance to ride it a second time

'This has turned my stomach, it's such a disgusting thing to do on Christmas Day,' she said.

'They are the lowest of the low scumbags doing that to a child, knowing he had it for Christmas.

'Ryan was really excited about his new BMX. Now he's just numb and gobsmacked.'

Unemployed Corina said Ryan had only ridden the bike once in the garden before he left it in a communal hallway of their flats.

She discovered thieves had struck after cooking Christmas dinner for the family, including her daughter Sophie, 25, and her two grandchildren, who live in the same building.

The BMW Zinc Echo, like the one pictured, cost £180 and Miss Barratt has still not paid for it yet as she got it on credit

The
theft came as the family were trying to get over a difficult year in 
which Ryan lost his grandmother and then Corina was made unemployed.

She added: 'My nan died in February and then my mum died in August.

'We'd had a lovely day but it had been hard on everyone before this theft. This has made it a bad ending to a bad year.

'I've not even paid for the bike yet, but it's going to have to be replaced. It just kills me, it's disgusting and I want them to know how low they are.'

West Midlands Police are investigating the theft.

A spokesman said: 'Police in 
Birmingham were called on Christmas night after a child's new bike had 
been stolen from a block of flats in the city.

'The
youngster's Christmas present had been left in a communal area of the 
flats, on Trident Close in Erdington, but the family discovered the lime
green BMX had gone later that night.

'Police were called and are investigating the burglary.'

Ryan still has the box for his BMX Zinc as a constant reminder that he only got to ride the present once before it was taken
