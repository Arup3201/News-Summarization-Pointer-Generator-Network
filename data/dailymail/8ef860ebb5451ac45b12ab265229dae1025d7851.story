An escaped Colombian convict got breast implants and dressed as a woman to avoid being sent back to jail, police said.

Giovanni Rebolledo - sentenced in 2012 to 60 years in prison for kidnapping, robbery and extortion - underwent surgery to become 'Rosalinda.'

After his extreme make-over, he started working as a prostitute in the Viejo Prado district of the northern coastal city of Barranquilla.

But, despite his new appearance, police still recognised him on Saturday during a routine stop-and-search.

He was arrested and paraded before the country's media.

El Tiempo newspaper reports that Rebolledo, originally from the capital of Bogota, was jailed last year for his involvement in the Los Topos criminal gang.

The group allegedly used beautiful women to seduce wealthy men into coming home with them.

Once under the gang's control, the men would be tortured with electric shocks into handing over bank cards, their pin numbers and other valuables.
