A nine-year-old girl has shunned endless hours of watching TV and playing children’s computer games to read an amazing 364 books - in just seven months.

Faith Jackson is such a bookworm she prefers a daily intake of Secret Seven and Famous Five to TV’s Four O’Clock Club and Bear Behaving Badly.

The youngster has been hailed a real-life 'Matilda' after the book-loving Crunchem Hall schoolgirl created by author Roald Dahl.

Faith Jackson, a nine year old girl from Knutsford, Cheshire, is a real-life Matilda who just loves to read, just like the Roald Dahl character

And she has been rewarded with a certificate of achievement from award-winning author Cressida Cowell who penned That Rabbit Belongs to Emily Brown and How to Train Your Dragon.

Recent figures show that, unlike, Faith, today’s youngster spends more time during their childhood watching TV than they spend at school.

According to scientists, by the age of seven, a child will have spent a full year glued to screens, with the average 10-year-old having five TVs readily available to watch at home.

But Faith’s mother Lauren, 35, a housewife from Ashley, Cheshire, said: 'Faith says reading is just as stimulating as TV or computer games, more so even, as you have to use your own imagination rather than letting the screen conjure it all up for you.

'I don’t think it’s particularly bad, or inherently wrong, for children to be sat in front of the television, or playing on computers - but I do think it’s a shame that for many children these forms of entertainment have entirely taken the place of reading.

Her reading has even caught the eye of acclaimed author Cressida Cowell and she has her own review section in the local library

Faith initially found reading a struggle but fell in love with it when she was seven after being encouraged to read more by her family and teachers

'Personally I don’t think there’s anything wrong with watching television, and films - but only as long as you keep a pretty close eye on the subject matter of what your children are viewing.

'My only real "rule" on the TV revolves around the fact that we have always had only one television in the house.

'So, whatever programme is on has to be suitable for whoever is in the house at the time, and there has to be a group decision to play on the Wii computer games.

'But I always take the time out to help Faith by listening to her read. I think more parents should share a bedtime story with their children in the hopes that they will develop a passion for reading as much as my daughter has.'

Faith initially found books a struggle but fell in love with reading when she was seven after being encouraged to read more by her family and teachers at Mobberley Church of England Primary School.

She started with short stories which were moderately easy to read but now, only two years on, takes on more challenging Enid Blyton books and novels penned by Cressida Cowell - which can run to 400 pages.

Faith began to keep track of her reading at the suggestion of her mother. As well as Enid Blyton, she reads The Hardy Boys adventures created by Edward Stratemeyer, the Harry Potter series, plus books by Tracy Beaker author Jaqueline Wilson.

After classes she scours her local library at Knutsford looking for the latest new titles.

Staff have even give her a section of the library to herself to quietly read and have created a display board showing her book recommendations for other youngsters.

She has also written a guest review on Enid Blyton for the American blogsite: 'This Kid Reviews Books.'

Mrs Jackson said: 'I am thrilled Faith has found something that she takes such pleasure in, that makes her feel positive about her own ability and of course, helps her at school too.

'I initially read all the Harry Potters to her - it took nearly a year to read all seven aloud and she has read a few of the earlier ones to herself too.

'She’s read a lot of Roald Dahl and particularly likes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - although I’m not sure Faith is like Matilda because until she was seven Faith could hardly read at all.'

She added: 'It is wonderful to see Faith's excitement with every new book she opens. I’m proud in everything that she does.

'The only minor point of contention over her reading is that she doesn’t seem to have much time judgement. Often my husband and I will head for bed at around 11 or midnight and she’ll still have her nose in a book.

'We have to ask her to stop reading and switch off the light because she just doesn’t want to stop - it seems like she has escaped into her own little world.'

Faith said: 'I mostly like the kind of books with animals or magic or adventures in them. If they have all three of those things then it’s even better.

'When I first started, I wasn’t actually trying to read that many books, my mummy just thought that it would be a good idea to keep track of every book I had read.

'But my life is not all about books. I do four hours of gymnastics every week, do karate classes, play netball and I’m learning to play the drums.

'I also like climbing, and riding my bike, rollerblading - and watching the odd bit of television. But for me, reading is the most fun thing to do.

Faith Jackson loves sports as well as reading and has just started to learn kickboxing

'My bedroom looks like it’s built out of books,' she said. 'I have three packed bookcases and piles of books wobbling everywhere so yes, I’m running out of room!

'It’s just too hard to choose a favourite book but if I had to I would probably like The Hardy Boys series the best though. Reading can help your education, your imagination - and it’s just so much fun.'

Author Cressida Cowell said: 'Reading for pleasure is one of the key factors in a child’s later educational success, and as a nation we need to get our children reading for the joy of it, and talking excitedly to their friends about books, just as Faith is doing.'
