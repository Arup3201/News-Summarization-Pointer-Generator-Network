Finland's glamorous entrant in this year's Eurovision Song Contest plans to 'make a statement' about her country's ban on gay marriage during her performance.

Krista Siegfrids, 27, will perform 'Marry Me' at the competition in Sweden on Saturday 18 May and said she is planning a 'surprise' at the end of her routine.

In a previous performance of her song at a Eurovision concert in Amsterdam last week, which you can view below, she shocked the audience by kissing one of her female backing dances.

Planning a surprise: Krista Siegfrids said she wants to 'make a statement' during her Eurovision performance

A gay kiss broadcast across Europe on the night of the contest would cause a huge controversy for the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) as it would draw outrage from some homophobic quarters of Eastern Europe.

But Krista said they won't be able to stop her.

'Homophobic people are 
angry with me for doing this. But I'm planning a surprise at the end of 
my performance. It's live on TV, so nobody can stop me,' she said in the Independent on Sunday.

Singing for victory: Political statements are not allowed in the contest but the Finnish entrant said her song is about 'love and tolerance'

The rules of the Eurovision Contest state that 'no lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted during the ESC'.

They add: 'The lyrics and/or performance of the songs shall not bring the Shows, the ESC as such or the EBU into disrepute.'

The lyrics of Krista's catchy dance song, which she performs in a wedding dress, refer to a woman wanting her boyfriend to propose to her.

Krista said: 'I don't think 'Marry Me' is political. It's about love and tolerance. But gay marriage is not
 allowed in Finland and that's wrong. I wanted to make a statement about
 that.'

Spectacle: Her performance will involve her wearing a bridal gown with a 'surprise' at the end

Finland created same-sex civil partnerships in 2002 but same-sex marriage is not recognised by law.

Earlier this year, thousands of Finnish people flocked to sign a petition on equal marriage rights calling on politicians to take a vote on the issue.

According to Yle, Finland's national public-broadcasting company: 'Public enthusiasm for the petition was
 so great that the Ministry of Justice's civic proposal website 
kansalaisaloite.fi crashed as a result of the overwhelming demand.'

'I want to get everyone's support': The popstar hopes she can count on votes from Britain

However, Krista won't be able to count on votes from her compatriots to help her win Eurovision and spread her message on equal marriage rights further because viewers aren't allowed to vote for their own country's entry.

Instead she hopes she can count on British support to propel her to victory.

She said: 'Since you can't vote 
for your own entry, I hope you will vote for Finland. I know the show is
 watched on huge screens in gay bars in Soho and I want to get 
everyone's support in Britain.'

The Eurovision Song Contest will be broadcast on BBC1 from 8pm on Saturday 18 May hosted by Graham Norton. The UK's entrant is 80s pop sensation Bonnie Tyler, 61.

Referring to her own chance of success, Bonnie said: 'It's a tricky one the Eurovision Song Contest because it's not all about the music, is it?'
