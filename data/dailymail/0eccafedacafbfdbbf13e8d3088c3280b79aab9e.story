A red phone box has been transformed into Scotland's smallest internet cafe and tourist information centre.

The box, in Aberdeenshire, purchased from BT for £1 by Ballogie and Birse Community Council, is proving a popular stopping point for travellers making the journey over Cairn O'Mount between Angus and Royal Deeside.

Despite only being 0.8 square metres, the box has facilities to allow guests to to brew themselves a coffee, check emails, or simply relax and take in the view while they browse its selection of leaflets and information on local attractions.

Happy customers: Local residents use the miniature cafe next to the Butterworth Gallery at Ballogie

Coffee break: Sarah Harker's family run the neighbouring Butterworth Gallery at Ballogie

Sarah Harker, whose family run the neighbouring Butterworth Gallery at Ballogie, said the box was proving to be a real boon to the area.

She said: 'We used to have a tea room attached to the gallery and after we closed it to concentrate on the art side of business, we were forever getting visitors looking for coffee or tea, so we decided to install a machine in the phone box.

'We then thought as we are in a very rural part of Scotland it might be useful to let our visitors go online while they are taking a break from driving.'

Self-service coffee machine: Visitors can help themselves to a drink while surfing the Internet

Pit stop: Customers are welcome to drop by and check their emails 24 hours a day

She said the cafe would be open 24 hours a day and would remain self service for the foreseeable future.

She added: 'There isn't room in the box for a waitress service or indeed any staff,

'There is an honesty box and our visitors just leave whatever they think is appropriate.'
