The unidentified man has been charged over the incident after he damaged the police vehicle parked outside the entrance of Penrith Police Station on Tuesday.

Footage of the incident shows the man standing on the roof of the vehicle in a red shirt and dark pants as he used a long object to smash the top of the car.
