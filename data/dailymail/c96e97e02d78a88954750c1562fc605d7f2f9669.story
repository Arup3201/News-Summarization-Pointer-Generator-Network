Tottenham are refusing all offers for Erik Lamela and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.

Napoli and Inter Milan have both tried to take Lamela back to Italy while Paris St Germain and Roma have designs on Lloris.

Yet Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino sees both as pivotal to his plans.

Argentine Lamela could finally blossom under compatriot Pochettino and is keen to finally replicate the Serie A form he showed with Roma that attracted so many suitors.

Opportunity: Erik Lamela could get a chance to prove his worth under Mauricio Pochettino

Going nowhere: Spurs are refusing all offers for goalkeeper Hugo Lloris

Key: New Spurs boss Pochettino sees Lamela and Lloris as pivotal to his plans

Tottenham have given him permission to train with former club River Plate but have rebuffed loan offers and want him to play a more active part in the first team.

Lloris is highly valued and his presence may also have a bearing on who Tottenham bring in as an understudy with the likes of Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall unlikely to get a significant run apart from in cup competitions should he join.

Napoli are continuing to court Tottenham over Brazilian midfielder Sandro while Chelsea's pursuit of Paulinho could yet be revived depending on their talks with the respective clubs of Cesc Fabregas, Koke and Paul Pogba.
