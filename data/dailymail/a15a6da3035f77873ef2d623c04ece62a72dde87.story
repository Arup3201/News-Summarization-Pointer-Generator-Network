A young Texas couple buried their five-day-old daughter today, after an obstetrician fatally cracked her skull and spine with forceps during delivery.

Rachel Melancon, 24, and her fiance Allen Coats wrote on a Facebook support page today how pleased they were with the turnout at the funeral in Port Arthur, Texas.

'So many people came and donated and gave us support. We are standing here at peace because all of you! Y'all are truly carrying our pain in y'all's heart.'

Hard Day: Rachel Melancon and Allen Coats buried their five-day-old daughter today, who died after suffering injuries during birth caused by forceps

Damage: Baby Olivia was born with a fractured skull and broken spinal cord, which left her brain damaged

Tribute: At the funeral today, mourners celebrated baby Olivia's short life by releasing hundreds of balloons into the overcast sky

At the memorial, mourners celebrated 
baby Olivia Marie's short life, by release hundreds of balloons into an 
overcast sky. The grieving parents called it the 'most beautiful thing 
ever'.

Since the 
infant's passing, family, friends and strangers have been rallying to 
support the young couple in their fight to sue both the obstetrician and
 the Medical Center of Southeast Texas.

Four
 days ago, father Allen Coats started a Go Fund Me campaign for $20,000,
 with the proceeds to cover medical and funeral costs, as well as spread
 awareness about the damage forceps can do.

As of Saturday evening, the campaign had raised nearly $9,000 of that goal from 432 donors.

The sudden loss of their baby truly came as a surprise to the parents, as Melancon had experienced a healthy pregnancy.

Ms Melancon, at 4ft 11in and weighing
 95lb before she became pregnant, had asked for a cesarean section when 
her baby was overdue and large, considering her mother's petite frame.

But
 doctors warned her against having that type of delivery, saying she'd 
be left with a scar, her mother-in-law Angie Coats told ABC News.

After going into labor, baby Oliva's heart rate was increasing but the expectant mom kept being told to wait.

Hope: Rachel had experienced a healthy pregnancy and the couple were looking forward to their baby's arrival

'It was 18 hours until the delivery. 
[Rachel] was running a 103 fever ... Five hours passed, then [the obstetrician] came in 
and she started to push. But she was so worn out and the baby wasn't 
even in the birth canal,' Ms Coats said.

She claimed the baby was facing the wrong way and Dr Backardjiev tried to turn her with his hands.

'When he couldn't do that, he took the 
small forceps to try to pull the baby out. He kept going and even put 
his foot up on the bed trying to pull,' she said.

In a forceps delivery a metal instrument, shaped like salad tongs, is clamped around the baby's head.

They are used to either guide the baby out the birth canal or, if the baby is facing the wrong way, to rotate the baby.

The mother is generally given an episiotomy - an incision from the vagina to the anus - as there is an increased likelihood of tearing.

It is considered a risky delivery, with the Mayo Clinic reminding expectant mothers that generally when a forceps delivery is recommended a C-Section is also an option.

In the mother, forceps can cause long-term urinary or fecal incontinence; genital tears; and damage to the uterus or bladder.

For babies, forceps can cause fractures, bleeding within the skull and facial injuries.

'When he touched the top and side of the skull, we heard a pop, like clay cracking in pottery and heard her skull crush.'

Ms Melancon was rushed off for an emergency cesarean but when Olivia was finally delivered the family say she was unable breathe.

Their baby was rushed to Hermann Hospital, where the parents were told that she had suffered numerous fractures.

In a post on their Facebook page, Ms Melancon said she heard 
'2 big popping sounds (it was her skull)' as the doctor used the 
forceps.

She claimed 
her baby was then left in the birth canal while the doctor stitched
 Ms Melancon up before she could have the emergency C-section.

'I
 felt her pulled out of me and the room was silent. No crying baby and 
they told Allen to leave the room. That's the last I remember before 
waking up to my baby girl lifeless,' she said in a heartbreaking post.

The parents kept a vigil at Olivia's bedside for five days before she was taken off life support.

Her heart valve and tissue behind her legs and knees were donated to save another baby's life.

Hospital chief executive Matt Roberts released a statement saying that Olivia's death 'rips at our hearts'.

The statement added that the hospital could not comment on specific cases but confirmed that a review would be carried out.

As well as a Facebook page to detail their experiences and raise awareness, the couple have set up a Go Fund Me page to pay for the funeral and try to pass Olivia's Law to ban the use of forceps.

Skull
 fractures are a risk during forceps births. The Mayo Clinic advises: 
'Keep in mind that whenever a forceps delivery is recommended, a 
C-section is typically also an option.'
