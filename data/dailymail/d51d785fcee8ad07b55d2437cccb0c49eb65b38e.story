The Church of England is fighting to claim the rights to minerals beneath thousands of homes and farms, it emerged last night.

Legal action has already begun, raising fears the Church could try to cash in on the controversial process of fracking.

Under a new law, landowners have until October to assert their rights over minerals.

The Church still holds rights in several parts of England, including some places where geologists believe energy can be extracted by fracking

Residents across the country have now started receiving letters from the Land Registry, informing them that the Church is seeking to register the mineral rights to the earth beneath their property.

Church Commissioners – who manage the Church’s investments – are trying to assert  ownership of 500,000 acres of land, an area roughly the size of Sussex.

The claim, which lawyers believe could allow the Church to profit from fracking, is being made under laws dating back to the Norman Conquest.

The age-old laws give ‘lords of the manor’ the rights to extract anything of value from the earth underneath property on their estates.

The Church still holds these rights in several parts of England.

Residents and environmentalists have mounted strong opposition against shale gas drilling near their homes, claiming the process could contaminate water supplies and even trigger earthquakes

These include some places where geologists believe energy can be extracted by fracking – the controversial process of extracting oil and cash by fracturing underground rocks with water and chemicals.

Residents and environmentalists have mounted strong opposition against shale gas drilling near their homes, claiming the process could contaminate water supplies and even trigger earthquakes.

But the commissioners have started sending legal letters to residents informing them of the Church’s ‘unilateral’ right to benefit from any mines and minerals under their land. One recipient spoke of his concerns that the Church’s claim could be linked to future fracking projects.

Dr Richard Lawson, a retired GP who lives in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, said: ‘It’s an ethical question for the Church – will they use their mineral rights to block fracking or to make money out of it?’

And one recipient, whose home in Nottinghamshire is less than five miles from an area with proven oil reserves, said: ‘It’s quite perplexing that you can own your own home but then someone comes along and tells you they own the ground beneath your feet.

‘It’s a bit of a coincidence that this happens when people are talking about fracking.’

However the Church has released a statement insisting that they have ‘no particular plans to mine under any property,’ adding: ‘This is confined to registering what the Commissioners have owned for many years. There is absolutely no link with fracking.’
