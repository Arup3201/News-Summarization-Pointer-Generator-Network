A killer superbug which claimed the lives of two patients in a Los Angeles hospital has been linked to a surgical tool used on more than 500,000 patients a year. 

At least seven people have contracted the antibiotic resistant bacteria while undergoing endoscopic procedures at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center between October and January. 

Medics fear that more than 170 patients may have been put at risk having been treated with the suspect piece of equipment.

Dr Robert Cherry, the hospital's chief medical quality officer, confirmed that two endoscopes that were used to diagnose and treat patients with pancreatic and bile-duct problems here contaminated with 'embedded' infections.

Five other endoscopes were found to be clear. 

Worryingly, the two infected endoscopes had been cleaned according to the manufacturer's instructions. 

Dr Cherry said that a more stringent sterilisation technique had been introduced following the fatal outbreak. 

Dr Benjamin Schwartz, deputy director of acute communicable disease control and prevention for the LA County Department of Public Health said: 'This outbreak is not a threat to public health.' 

Scientists have confirmed the infection is a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE. 

The bug was found on the endoscope which is inserted down a patient's throat to allow a doctor to examine internal organs without the need for major surgery.

The infection has been linked back to a 'source case' patient responsible for the outbreak. 

Medics only discovered the problem in mid December after a patient, who had just undergone an endoscopic procedure developed an infection which could not be treated with antibiotics.  

Attorney Kevin Boyle said Thursday that one of his clients, an 18-year-old student, was among those infected after he entered the hospital for a procedure that involved using an endoscope to examine his pancreas.

Mr Boyle said: 'After he had the procedure he was released. Then he came down with his illness, and when they studied him and noticed he had the CRE bacteria in him they quickly put two and two together.

Mr Boyle declined to release the teenager's name or say where he attends school but said he spent 83 days in the hospital at one point and was released but recently relapsed and is currently hospitalised. 

He said the family doesn't blame UCLA but is considering suing the endoscope's manufacturer.

Dr Deverick Anderson, infectious-disease expert at Duke University said: 'You can very easily do everything right and still have some contamination

'We're finding this is a problem, but it's probably one that we don't have a very good solution to right now.'

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday issued an advisory warning doctors that even when a manufacturer's cleaning instructions are followed, germs may linger. The device's complex design and tiny parts make complete disinfection extremely difficult, the advisory said. Between January 2013 and December 2014, the FDA received 75 reports involving 135 patients in the U.S. who may have been infected by tainted scopes.

In a statement, the FDA said it is trying to determine what more can be done to reduce such infections. But it said that pulling the device from the market would deprive hundreds of thousands of patients of 'this beneficial and often life-saving procedure.'

'The FDA believes at this time that the continued availability of these devices is in the best interest of the public health,' the agency said. 

The bacteria can cause infections of the bladder or lungs, leading to coughing, fever or chills. CRE infections have been reported in every state except Idaho, Alaska and Maine, according to the CDC

Similar outbreaks of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been reported around the nation. They are difficult to treat because some varieties are resistant to most known antibiotics
