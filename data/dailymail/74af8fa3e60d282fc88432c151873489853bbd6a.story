A grandmother who complained of neck pain after a fall died after medics repeatedly failed to take her to hospital - instead telling her to take paracetamol.

Ruby Rice, 89, of North Walsham, Norfolk, did in fact have a broken neck - and died after becoming paralysed from the neck down as a result of the fall.

Her devastated son Paul, 55, said paramedics and her GP were called several times but she was simply told to 'take paracetamol'.

She was not taken to hospital for X-rays until November 19th - about three weeks after the fall which caused the fracture to her neck.

Mr Rice wants a review into procedures and policies around when a patient should be transported to hospital for further assessment, and has written to the Care Quality Commission health watchdog.

East of England Ambulance Service and Mrs Rice's GP surgery have offered their sympathies and encouraged her family to contact them to discuss concerns.

Mr Rice said: 'I am not apportioning blame to the crews. I am concerned about policy.

'My mother had osteoporosis and brittle bones - they should have acted.'

The ambulance service was first called on November 13 when Mrs Rice fell in the hallway of her home.

The medical report stated the slip caused 'slight' discomfort to her neck and no injury was discovered.

The next day, a GP visited her at home, having been contacted about Mrs Rice's neck pain.

On November 15, she suffered yet another fall, yet the according to her medical report 'no new injuries' were reported, although her neck was still 'painful'.

The following day, she was referred back to her GP for a medical review and took paracetamol for her neck pain.

On November 19th, following yet another fall in her kitchen, she was finally taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where she was diagnosed with a broken pelvis and an 'historic break' to her neck.

After a long stay in hospital, she was discharged to a care home in North Walsham, but became paralysed from the neck down. She died on February 3rd.

Her son said: 'It is possible that my mother's neck condition would have been discovered earlier had she been taken for further assessment during one of these earlier attendances.'

Her surgery, Paston Surgery in North Walsham, offered sympathies but said it was 'inappropriate to comment further due to patient confidentiality'.

In a statement, the East of England Ambulance Service said: 'Our sympathies are with Mrs Rice's family at this time. 

'We were called to Mrs Rice a number of times in 2014 and our crews made referrals to other community healthcare including GPs and social services. 

'Our last call to Mrs Rice was on November 20 when we took her into hospital.

'If Mrs Rice's family would like to speak to us about her treatment and care last year, we would be happy to do this.'

Joan Skeggs, assistant director of quality and safety at NHS England (East) said: 'We would like to offer our sincere sympathies to Mrs Rice’s family, at what must be an extremely difficult time for them.

'We have not received a formal complaint regarding Mrs Rice’s care.

'We take complaints about the services we commission very seriously and would be happy to speak to Mrs Rice’s family about the care and treatment that she received from her GP practice.'
