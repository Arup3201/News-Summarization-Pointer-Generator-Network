Whether at sunrise, sunset or the heart of the day, in the height of summer or engulfed by snow, photographer James Grant is convinced that the Peak District offers some of the most spectacular landscapes Great Britain has to offer.

The parochial landscape photographer has a passion for hills and mountains, in particular those surrounding his home town of Matlock on the south eastern edge of the Peak District, although he also has a soft spot for the Lake District, Snowdonia and Scotland.

These images of rolling hills bathed in light and mist show the breadth of an already formidable mountain of work from the 26-year-old.

Photographer James Grant is on a one-man mission to show the public how beautiful the Peak District and Great Britain really is

A sea of mist sits peacefully on the dry limestone valley known as Cave Dale in the Derbyshire Peak District

He captures rolling hills, rippling rivers and panoramic views to show the region from all angles and share the remarkable views he enjoys on his meanderings through the landscape. 

'I think every single person in this world enjoys a good view, it's just about knowing how to get there and what is involved,' Grant said.

'I also want to share what I have seen over the years to help people see similar scenes.'

James work began in 2008 when he realised he was missing a trick by walking on Kinder Scout, Derbyshire and the Peak District's highest point, without a camera. He soon fixed that with the purchase of a Sony a200, his first digital camera. 

The Rushup Edge ridge, also in the Peak District in Derbyshire, rises from the mist as a raggedy tree defies gravity

Great Ridge peeks up through the fog - the ridges separates the vales of Edale and Castleton in Derbyshire's Peak District

The stunning Lumsdale Falls are a beauty to be hold at the best of times, highlighted only further by a delicate dusting of snow

Grant is also planning to release a book of more than 250 of his works in mid-July this year, with advice on where and how to take the most beautiful landscape photographs in the Peak District. 

Images include a stunning sunset over a snow-capped Shutingsloe and and brilliant sight of the Milky Way from Arbor Low.

Peak District Through The Lens: A Photography Guide to the Most Picturesque Places in the Peak District will also include Ordnance Survey-style mapping, directions on the best times to get the best shots and how to get to James' favourite spots.  

Lose Hill stands proudly under the pink sky in the south-east corner of Edale parish, as seen from Pindale - to the east is Win Hill

The small but impossible-to-miss Parkhouse Hill, with its sharp top edge, is a distinctive feature of the district near the Staffordshire border

Higger Tor on the Dark Peak glows as it lords over the Burbage Valley (left) and a majestic view of the Milky Way from Arbor Low

This spooky shot does little to dissuade us from believing the legend that Winnats Pass is haunted by a young couple murdered by miners

Alport Castles get their name from the protruding grit-stone mounds that from the distance look like a fortified structure

While walking through these autumnal Larch trees to Nether Hay, James decided to look back along the path he walked along

Kinder Scout, the highest point of the Peak District at 2,087 ft, is covered in cloud but it's no less a brilliant view from the road

Below the mist is the village of Baslow, in Derbyshire, between Sheffield and Bakewell and just north of the famous Chatsworth House

Doxey Pool (left) at the top of The Roaches is said to be home to a water spirit, while Ashopton Bridge (right) offers an outstanding reflection

It's not all majestic natural masterpieces in the Peak District, the region has to work for a living with plants such as the Hope Cement Works

Wolfscote Dale is a peaceful and wonderful sight covered in snow as the river ripples through the landscape

Or, given James' aim to inspire others to get out there and enjoy Britain's national parks, enthusiastic walkers can simply use its pages as a stepping off point for their next adventure.

'I want people out there to be enjoying our national parks that, as a country, we work hard to preserve,' he said.

'We spend a lot of time at work in the week and it's a great escape people can enjoy for a relatively low cost.'
