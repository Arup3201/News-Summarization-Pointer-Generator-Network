A surveillance video was released Wednesday showing the moment an off-duty police officer in Brazil dropped his infant daughter to the ground to shoot an armed robber who threatened his family.

The unnamed officer was standing with his 3-month-old daughter in his arms and talking to his relatives in the city of Campinas, Sao Paulo, on Tuesday when they were approached by a man carrying a gun.

The 21-second footage posted on the video-sharing site LiveLeak shows the 41-year-old man wearing shorts and a white T-shirt glancing about before heading for the cop and his family as they chatted outside their gated home.
