Vince Cable launched a withering attack on the Tories yesterday as he talked up the prospects of a possible Lib-Lab Pact after the next election.

The Business Secretary insisted that any future government should ‘have Liberal Democrats at its heart’ and boasted of his recent flirtations with Labour.

He even pretended to take a text message from Ed Miliband during his speech – saying ‘Please Ed, not now’ – and referred to ‘Plan V’ the secret plot that could see him made Chancellor in a Labour government, which was revealed by the Mail at the weekend.

Controversial remarks: Business Secretary Vince Cable today used his a 
speech at the Liberal Democrat conference to talk up the possibility of an alliance with the Labour party after the next election

The conference speech was seen as a 
naked bid to curry favour with the party grassroots and position him for
a leadership challenge.

He also taunted David Cameron for his ‘split’ with Boris Johnson calling it ‘enticing’ for the Lib Dems. 

And he dismissed Tories who want to 
see deregulation of employment laws as ‘head bangers’ and ‘backwoodsmen’
who find sacking workers ‘an aphrodisiac’.

Mr Cable said: ‘Most of our MPs will 
face Conservatives at the next General Election. They face the enticing 
prospect of a Tory split.

'I don’t know what Boris and Dave got up to in 
Eton. Perhaps a pillow fight got out of control in the dormitories.’

Pillow talk: The ongoing rivalry between London Mayor Boris 
Johnson and Prime Minister David Cameron gave Mr Cable reason to predict a Tory 
party split at the next election

He then stirred up the controversy 
surrounding Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell’s rant at a policeman: ‘I 
have been told that jokes about social class are not good for the unity 
of the Coalition. But as a mere pleb, I couldn’t resist it.’

Mr Cable boasted of blocking Tories 
who wanted to deregulate the workplace, saying: ‘We have seen off the 
head bangers who want a hire and fire culture and seem to find sacking 
people an aphrodisiac.’

'Fairer tax in tougher times': Mr Cable vowed to press ahead with plans to for 'the proper taxation of wealth and land' despite Tory objections

And he vowed to press ahead with plans
to introduce ‘the proper taxation of wealth and land’. ‘It horrifies 
the Tory backwoodsmen but it is popular and right,’ he said.

In a clear signal of where his 
political heart lies, Mr Cable praised the virtues of the Labour Party, 
of which he was a member in the 1970s.

‘Labour can still be a ruthless 
political machine but it used to be a lot more than that. It once had a 
soul and new ideas,’ he said.

Mr Cable insisted he still backs the 
Tory plans to rein in the deficit.

‘Actually it is not a matter of Plan A
versus Plan B or Plan C or even Plan V,’ he said. ‘Plan A+ is OK by me.

‘I believe we struck the right balance
and adopted a deficit reduction plan. I make no apology for my 
continued support for that fiscal discipline.’

But he also warned that failure to spark growth would lead to ‘economic disaster and political oblivion’.

Mr Cable said the Lib Dems should 
‘fight the next General Election as a totally independent, national, 
credible challenger for power’ but made it clear he believes they will 
remain in government whoever wins the election.

‘I don’t believe tactually that the 
British people will want to entrust their future to any one party next 
time,’ he said.

‘That government must have Liberal Democrats at its 
heart.’

Mr Cable also launched an outspoken assault on bankers, accusing them of ‘greed and stupidity’.

‘Our leading banks are often 
anti-business especially anti-small business. They threw traditional 
relationship banking over the side and sold useless insurance and dodgy 
derivatives instead.

‘Public anger at the greed and stupidity in this industry will continue for a long time.’

Later, in an interview with Channel 4 
News, he again hinted that he would like to be party leader, insisting 
that at 69 he is not too old.

‘I work hard, I’ve got plenty of 
energy, I’ve got good health, I don’t see my age as being a problem,’ he
said. ‘I’m not bidding for the leadership but whatever job I have, I 
don’t see my age as an impediment.’

And he even claimed that if the Tories
will not sanction his plans for a Mansion Tax on homes worth over 
£2million, he could impose it in coalition with Labour instead.

‘If we don’t persuade the Conservatives we will continue to make the case into any future election, of course.’
