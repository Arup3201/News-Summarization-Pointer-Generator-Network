Barcelona and Arsenal have joined Manchester City in monitoring San Lorenzo forward Angel Correa.

The 18-year-old has been compared to City striker Sergio Aguero in his style, although is yet to prove as prolific. Atletico Madrid have reportedly already had an offer rejected.

Barcelona are also closing on a deal for Croatia starlet Alen Halilovic.

The former Tottenham target has been the subject of increased bids from the Spanish champions as they look to groom a replacement for Xavi. Dinamo Zagreb want a deal worth £12m with add-ons.

Hopeful players duped by fake agent scams

Fake agents have been luring footballers into paying out thousands of pounds in exchange for trials at Premier League clubs.

Young players, particularly from Spain, 
Africa and Australia have been duped in recent months by people posing 
as other agents, scouts and club employees offering trials, contracts 
and extra training at clubs such as Manchester City, Chelsea and 
Liverpool.

In exchange for £500, the players are
 promised contact with the clubs and a help with necessary visas while 
an extra £2,500 will help cover travel costs, medical fees and 
insurance.

One incident resulted in a 16-year-old boy arriving at Manchester Airport unaccompanied to await a club representative who never turned up as they knew nothing of any proposed deal. 

Although such dealings are not new to the game, they do seem to be on the increase as fraudsters sense a financial gain.

The cases are now being investigated by International Centre for Sports Security (ICSS), based in Doha, Qatar, who have raised the issue with the Premier League.

They have circulated an alert to all licensed football agents which outlines how players have been contacted via Facebook and social media and particularly file sharing sites where players upload videos of themselves playing football.

So far, ICSS say clubs that have been unwittingly used include Hull City, Stoke, Sunderland, Bursaspor and LA Galaxy as well as the three Champions League contenders in Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.

Fake documents with forged signatures have been uncovered and bank accounts traced to England, USA and Ukraine.

An ICSS statement said: 'If players have any doubts they should contact the relevant clubs, check their official websites for contact details and phone them direct. Clubs will not contact you via Facebook, Linked In, Twitter. They are not likely to use Hotmail, Gmail or Yahoo email accounts. If they contact you it will only be by using their official email.'

Beckham trains at United's HQ Beckham was back at Manchester United last week. Not David but Brooklyn. 

The 14-year-old spent a few days during the October half-term training at United's Carrington HQ and took advantage of last week's school holidays to make a return.

Brooklyn, who has been playing with Fulham's academy this season and has had training spells with Chelsea and QPR, spent two days at Carrington again last week as he joined up with United's Under 15s.

United are on a push to bring in more young talent as well as at first-team level but, at this stage, Brooklyn is only training with the boys of his age group.

Old Trafford legend: Beckham has gone down in United lore after his trophy-laden time with the club

A keen United fan, he was spotted with his father David at Stamford Bridge last month as the family watched the Red Devils lose 3-1 at Chelsea.

David wasn't around to accompany Brooklyn at Carrington last week but has been keen to play down the expectation on his eldest son when discussing his prospects. Talking to ITV's Jonathan Ross show in December, he said: 'The unfortunate thing for the boys is, any time they go and have a kick about with the youth team at Chelsea or at Fulham, or even their Sunday league teams, people say "They've signed for them." Or ''They're going to be playing for them."

'And that's quite a lot of pressure on them as young kids. And they're just training at the moment. They're enjoying themselves, they're not signed with anyone, they're just enjoying playing football.'

Everton are keen on Colback

Everton remain among clubs interested in Sunderland's Jack Colback, who has rejected the latest contract offer from the club.

The 24-year-old and team-mate Phil Bardsley have both been made fresh offers but want to take stock of their options at the end of the season. Sunderland are keen to keep the duo and will make a revised offer next month when they hope to have a clearer indication of their Premier League status, although that could yet go down to the final day of the season.

Sunderland expect to lose Sebastian Larsson and Craig Gardner with Larsson, 28, an option for several Premier League sides including Stoke. Gardner is an option for Leicester also.

Stoke, meanwhile, have missed out on Hoffenheim's USA defender Fabian Johnson. The 26-year-old is joining Borussia Monchengladbach on a free in the summer.

Wigan target McAleny and TunnicliffeWigan manager Uwe Rosler is keen to sign Everton striker Conor McAleny and is competing with Ipswich Town to sign Ryan Tunnicliffe on loan from Fulham.

McAleny, 21, impressed Rosler when on loan at Brentford at the start of this season. The Liverpool-born forward broke his leg in only his fourth game yet has battled back to fitness and Rosler is keen to give him a chance in the Championship.

Tunnicliffe only moved to Fulham from Manchester United in January but could be surplus to requirements under Felix Magath. Rosler and Mick McCarthy are keen to take him on loan.

Wigan are prepared to let defender Ivan Ramis go out on loan also after the collapse of proposed moves to Cardiff and Crystal Palace.

Leeds and Bolton eye MoxeyCrystal Palace defender Dean Moxey is wanted by Bolton and Leeds United.

Manager Tony Pulis is willing to let the 28-year-old left back go out on loan even though he has figured in 20 games this season.

Moxey has competition from Jonathan Parr, who Bolton also like, with manager Dougie Freedman knowing them well from his time at Palace.

However, Leeds' new owners are also looking to push on for promotion and are keen to help Brian McDermott by adding Premier League quality to his squad.

Inter close on Vidic as United weigh up striker options

Inter Milan hope to finalise the smaller details of Nemanja Vidic's contract by the end of this week and remain keen on Patrice Evra, too.

United assistant Phil Neville watched Porto's Eliaquim Mangala last week but staff still have reservations the centre back is worth his £37m valuation. They have also considered Jan Vertonghen at Tottenham. 

United remain hopeful of signing Borussia Dortmund's Ilkay Gundogan, as reported by MailOnline
 last month, and are weighing up strikers with PSG's Edinson Cavani, 
Atletico's Diego Costa, Mario Mandzukic at Bayern and Luciano Vietto at 
Racing Club among the options.

Liverpool kid Ilori wanted for good at GranadaGranada are considering a bold attempt to sign Liverpool's Tiago Ilori on a permanent basis after the Portuguese defender's impressive loan spell.

Ilori, 20, joined Liverpool last summer for £7m from Sporting Lisbon and is yet to play a game for the Anfield club but since moving to Granada on loan he has impressed sporting director Juan Carlos Cordero.

'For the experience he has he is calm, he has pace, moves the ball well. He has come in and fitted into the team very quickly,' said Cordero. 'When the end of the summer comes we'll see if he is wanted by the Liverpool first team or if they want to sell or loan him.'

Liverpool are continuing discussions with Glen Johnson over his future but are unlikely to pursue any interest in right back Bacary Sagna, who is awaiting an improved contract offer from Arsenal.

The 31-year-old has offers from Turkey and France but Liverpool are likely to look at younger options should Johnson fail to agree new terms.

Time to wave goodbye? Arsenal could lose Bacary Sagna this summer with contract talks unresolved

Villa scouts establish French connection

Aston Villa were among clubs represented at Auxerre's Coupe Gambardella tie with Strasbourg on the weekend. The tournament is for French Under 19 sides and Auxerre won 1-0 with a goal from 18-year-old striker François-Xavier Tamuzo, while midfielder Samed Kilic, 17, also impressed.
