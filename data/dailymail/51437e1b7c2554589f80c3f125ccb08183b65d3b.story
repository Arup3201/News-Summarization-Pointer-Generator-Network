In the never-ending search for exclusivity amongst high-end home-buyers the latest must-have feature is to have a moat encircling your property.

Back in medieval times, moats served as a line of defense from marauders, but nowadays the concept has been re-branded by exclusive architects as ‘wraparound water features.’

Celebrity home-owners are of course ahead of the curve on this kind of thing and so supermodel Gisele Bundchen and New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady had a moat included as part of their $20 million French-style estate in Brentwood, California, which they moved into earlier this year.

The couple's extensive water feature looks more like a winding stream than a means of defense and is home to some expensive koi fish rather than alligators. A stone bridge leads to the main entry.

The amazing property was the work of architect Richard Landry, one of the hot designers credited with creating this new trend.

Another celebrity who was at the forefront of the trend for ‘wraparound water features’ is Jennifer Lopez.

The star’s former home in Bel-Air, which recently resold for $10 million, includes an arched footbridge and a cobblestone driveway cross a stone-lined waterway that encircles the French-style villa.

Moats were historically deep, broad ditches used to provide castles and towns with a preliminary line of defense.

In some places, moats evolved into more extensive water defense systems, including lakes and dams, though in later periods they became largely ornamental.

The modern day equivalent have taken on a much more atheistically pleasing design features.

At one $36-million Beverly Hills contemporary, a narrow ‘demi-moat’ serves a practical purpose and takes the place of a guardrail, which would have obstructed the outstanding views of the city.
