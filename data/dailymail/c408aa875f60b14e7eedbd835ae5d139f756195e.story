The Northeast was under attack from brutally cold weather today as a winter storm swirled up the coast, creating blizzard conditions on Cape Cod, disrupting government work in Washington and leaving New York City under a foot of snow.

Winter storm Janus stretched from Kentucky to New England but hit hardest along the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor between Philadelphia and Boston.

About 1,400 flights were canceled nationwide on Wednesday, according to according to flight-tracking site flightaware.com.

About 3,000 commercial flights had been 
canceled on Tuesday in and out of some of the nation's busiest airports, 
including in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, 
where Logan Airport advised passengers to expect extremely limited 
domestic service at least through Wednesday morning.

Snow
 began falling on Tuesday morning in Philadelphia and had dumped as much
 as 14 inches by Wednesday morning. Manalapan, New Jersey recorded the 
highest snowfall with nearly 16 inches.

Philadelphia recorded slightly more than a foot of snow and Brookhaven, near Philadelphia's airport, received 15 inches. 

The storm, which dropped more than a 
foot of snow in parts of Massachusetts, largely spared Boston and areas 
to the west and north of the city.

Cape Cod was under a blizzard warning through Wednesday afternoon.

Boston and Philadelphia ordered schools closed on Wednesday, following the lead the day before of many districts in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.

Schools also were closed on Wednesday in Rhode Island, Connecticut, upstate New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, northern Virginia and the District of Columbia.

Federal workers in Washington who got a snow day on Tuesday were getting a two-hour delay on Wednesday.

Amtrak told passengers on its busiest line, the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, to expect fewer trains. Lines serving Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Albany, New York, also were slowed.

The storm put a damper on New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's inauguration, forcing the cancellation of a Tuesday evening gala on Ellis Island.

In Massachusetts, Governor Deval Patrick postponed his annual State of the State address, saying he was worried about guests trying to get to the statehouse.

On I-95, one of the nation's busiest 
highways, traffic was bumper to bumper on Tuesday evening north of New 
York City, where some people simply gave up and tried to navigate side 
streets, creating another traffic jam in suburban New Rochelle.

It
 was slow-going on roads elsewhere including New Jersey, where a speed 
restriction was issued for the turnpike and in the New York metropolitan
 area, authorities cautioned motorists about black ice.

Commuters
 in Philadelphia and New York had packed early trains or spent hours 
inching along roads in swirling darkness to get home.

The
 relentless snow fall on Tuesday brought angry criticism that local 
authorities in some areas didn't do enough to ensure that roads were 
cleared for the evening commute.

In
 New York, Mayor de Blasio's administration has been accused of being 
slow to react to the snow which hit a few hours earlier than expected on
 Tuesday. Residents in the Upper East Side neighborhood in Manhattan 
complained that their neighborhood was being deliberately ignored by 
snowploughs. 

The storm was
 a conventional one that developed off the coast and moved its way up 
the Eastern Seaboard, pulling in cold air from the Arctic.

Unlike the 
epic freeze of two weeks ago, it was not caused by a kink in the polar 
vortex, the winds that circulate around the North Pole.

In New York, Mayor de Blasio has come in for sharp criticism for his handling of the snow storm after residents in the Upper East Side complained that their neighborhood was being ignored by snow plows.

At one point on Tuesday afternoon the city's PlowNYC website appeared to show no snow plows between East 59th and 79th Streets and between Second and Fifth Avenues.

Residents complained to the New York Post that the wealthy area had been deliberately ignored.

'He is trying to get us back. He is very divisive and political,' said one angry resident.

But Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty has claimed the map was inaccurate because one spreader had a broken GPS and so wasn't reporting its progress.

'The GPS was not working,' he said. 'Also, traffic created a lot of problems for us in that area.'

At the same press conference de Blasio stood by his performance.

'All city agencies are acting [like] usual very, very effectively and in a coordinated fashion.'

All public schools will be open Wednesday.

Nonetheless, overnight temperatures in the single digits were expected in Philadelphia and New York, with wind chills dipping into the negative teens.

The frigid air extended to Kentucky, which was forecast to see similar temperatures and subzero wind chills.

On Tuesday morning, temperatures
 had plunged to minus 40F over the Upper Midwest and were below zero as
 far south as portions of the Ohio Valley and as far east as northern 
New England.

Dangerously low temperatures will spread southward in the East on Wednesday morning.

The advancing cold will be severe 
enough to bring life-threatening conditions, hypothermia and the risk of
 frostbite to areas from the northern Plains to New England, reports Accuweather.

The
 penetrating cold has the potential to cause water main breaks as far 
south as the Ohio Valley and mid-Atlantic and to freeze pipes into parts
 of the South.

While
 the winter blast is expected to be gone by Thursday, meteorologists 
predict it will be followed by another blast of cold air pushing down 
from Canada on Friday or Saturday.

The storm was blamed for at least one death in Maryland, after a car fishtailed into the path of a tractor-trailer on a snow-covered road about 50 miles northwest of Baltimore and the car's driver was ejected.

Police said the storm might have claimed more lives: A preliminary investigation showed wet conditions played a role in a two-vehicle crash that killed two people in Prince George's County, Maryland, and a tractor-trailer that jackknifed on Interstate 81 in Frederick County, Virginia, ran off the highway and hit a tree, killing the driver.

A total of three waves of arctic air will blast across the Midwest and Northeast and into next week.

The next blast of arctic air will reach the Upper Midwest by Wednesday.

While
 temperatures will briefly rebound in between the reinforcing waves of 
cold air, the rebounds will be much less pronounced from the Midwest to 
New England and may be barely noticeable in the northern tier states.

Temperatures
 may stay below freezing in Minneapolis, Chicago, Milwaukee, Detroit and
 Cleveland through the end of the month, where highs most days will be 
in the teens.

In 
Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City and Indianapolis, 
temperatures may only surpass the freezing mark on one or two days 
through Jan. 31.

The persistent cold will cause a renewed buildup of ice on rivers in the Northern states.

Ice jams could again become a problem during the coming weeks.

At least two of the cold waves will reach into the South. In much of the South, temperatures will not be as low as that of the first week of January.

However,
 many areas over the interior will have multiple nights where the 
temperature spends multiple hours well below freezing.

Temperatures will dip to near freezing during a few nights along the upper Gulf Coast.
