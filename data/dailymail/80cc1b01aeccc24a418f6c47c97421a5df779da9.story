A stay of execution was ordered on Wednesday morning for a schizophrenic killer who was set to face lethal injection within hours amid outcry that he is not mentally fit to be put to death.

The judgement from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas ordered that the execution of Scott Panetti, 56, be postponed 'to allow us to fully consider the late arriving and complex legal questions'. 

The condemned killer was due to be put to death at 6pm (CST) in Huntsville. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia some 14 years before shooting dead his estranged wife Sonja Alvarado's parents in front of her and their three-year-old daughter  in Fredericksburg in 1992. 

In a sworn affidavit in 1999, Ms Alvarado said that although she hated what her ex-husband did, he was a good man who suffered mental illness and should not be put to death.

Texas death row inmate Scott Panetti, pictured in 1999, talks during a prison interview in Huntsville, Texas, where he is on death row for the 1992 murder of his wife's parents. He is due to be executed later on Wednesday - as attorneys made 11th hour pleas to save him, claiming he is too delusional to stand trial

The prisoner's attorneys made an eleventh-hour appeal for their client saying he 'stands on the razor's edge of competency' and needs psychological evaluations to illustrate that his severe mental illness has worsened since he last was examined seven years ago. 

State attorneys contended Panetti's condition 'has not markedly changed' and he should not be given a reprieve from lethal injection.

No court has ruled Panetti mentally incompetent or insane.

The 56-year-old native of Hayward, Wisconsin, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1978.

He had been hospitalized more than a dozen times for treatment in the decade before fatally shooting Joe and Amanda Alvarado at their home in the Texas Hill Country in 1992. 

Their daughter Sonja, who was married to Panetti, and her three-year-old daughter, Amanda Lea, had moved in with them and she obtained a court order to keep Panetti away.

Ms Alvarado filed for divorce because of her husband's drinking and she said he was obsessed with the notion that the devil lived in their house.

He buried furniture and nailed the curtains shut. Panetti was also having hallucinations that the devil lived in the walls of the house and began washing the walls, believing that they were running with blood. 

On the morning of September 8, 1992, Panetti armed himself with a rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and knives, dressed in camouflage clothing and broke into his estranged wife's parents' home in Fredericksburg, about 60 miles north of San Antonio. 

Both Joe and Amanda Alvarado were shot at close range in front of his wife and daughter, before Panetti allowed them to leave. He later changed into a suit and handed himself into the police.  

Panetti's attorneys also have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the broader question of whether executing people who have mental illnesses violates the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment.

In 1986, the high court ruled states may not execute killers whose insanity means they can't understand why they're being put to death. 

In 2002, the justices prohibited the execution of the mentally impaired. 

Five years later, ruling on an appeal from Panetti, the court said mentally ill condemned prisoners could be put to death if they have a factual and rational understanding of why they're being punished.

Panetti has insisted Satan is working through Texas prison officials to execute him to keep him from preaching the Gospel.

Testimony from Scott Panetti's 1995 murder trial showed the depth of his delusions when he insisted on representing himself in court. He recounted the murders as such: 

Panetti: '... Sarge woke up. Cut off Scott's hair. Sarge suited up. Shells, canteen, pouch, 3006, tropical hat, tropical top, bunkhouse, fast, haircut fast, suited up fast, boom, ready fast, fast, haircut, webgear, top, brush hat, boots, out the door, in the jeep, driving, wife, the bridge. Why is it taking so long? In front of Joe and Amanda's house...

'Sarge, everything fast. Everything fast. Everything slow. Tapped on the window, shattered window. Sonja screams, runs, follow her. She runs out, out the front, knife, Birdie, Birdie [Scott and Sonja's daughter]. Where's Birdie? Pick her up, she's in bed...

'Scott, what? Scott, what did you see Sarge do?

'Fall. Sonja, Joe, Amanda, kitchen. Joe bayonet, not attacking. Sarge not afraid, not threatened. Sarge not angry, not mad. Sarge, boom, boom. Sarge, boom, boom, boom. Sarge, boom, boom.

'Sarge is gone. No more Sarge. Sonja and Birdie. Birdie and Sonja. Joe, Amanda lying kitchen, here, there, blood. No, leave. Scott, remember exactly what Scott did. Shot the lock walked in the kitchen. Sonja, where's Birdie? Sonja here. Joe, bayonet, door, Amanda. Boom, boom, boom, blood.

Demons. Ha, ha, ha, ha, oh, Lord, oh, you.

Judge: Mr Panetti, let's stop.

Panetti: You puppet.

Panetti's delusions 'have become more pervasive,' according to one of his attorneys, Gregory Wiercioch, who met with the inmate last week.

Wiercioch said Panetti told him devices implanted in his teeth by prison system dentists were sending command messages to his brain, that in the sixth grade he had a fight with future President Barack Obama at a Chicago museum and that his tooth told him to write a letter of apology to Obama.

Ellen Stewart-Klein, an assistant Texas attorney general, told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that records failed to support claims that Panetti's mental condition had deteriorated and that some of his odd behavior could be deliberate.

'Panetti's mental health condition has long been exaggerated to his benefit and he continues this long established pattern here,' Stewart-Klein said.

At his 1995 trial, Panetti acted as his own attorney, testified as alternate personality 'Sarge' to describe the Alvarado slayings and tried to subpoena Jesus Christ, the pope and the late President John F. Kennedy. 

Panetti wore a purple cowboy outfit, including a big cowboy hat, and largely ignored a standby attorney the judge appointed to assist him.

During a prison interview in 2006,  Panetti claimed he had been taken over by an alter ego he called Sarge Ironhorse, The New York Times reported. 

He also clutched Bible verses and tried to pull off his prison overalls to show scars which JFK had healed with coconut milk while he fought with the late president in the Pacific during the Second World War. 

Three years after her ex-husband's trial for the murder of her parents, Sonja Alvarado filed a petition saying that he should never have been tried for the crimes.  

According to her affidavit in 1999, Ms Alvarado said that she and her mother had tried to alert the police about the threat that her ex-husband posed.

'My mother and I begged the police to take the rifles. Scott had his deer rifle, the 30.06 rifle he used to kill my parents, and the other shotgun at my parents house,' she said. 'Even though the police were told to take the guns, they did not. Scott had made threats against my parents.'

She said that her initial police statement was made on the day of her parents' shooting before she had received medical care and was completely traumatized. 

Ms Alvarado said that she called the District Attorney about a week later when she felt her state of mind was more clear and wanted to add to her statement. 

She said: 'He [the DA] told me it was best to leave things as they were and they would stick to the original statement given.... Too many mistakes. I feel this was wrong of him... I feel now that I was used on the stand so that I would cover up for the law enforcement mistakes and the Sheriff of knowing Scott’s mental illness for years, not to mention all the other reports that were not written out.'

She added: 'I do not hate Scott. I hate what Scott did. Scott was a good person except when he changed... I know now that Scott is mentally ill and should not be put to death.'
