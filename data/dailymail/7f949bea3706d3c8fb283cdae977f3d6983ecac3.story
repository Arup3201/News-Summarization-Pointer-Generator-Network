Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated his goal during Real Madrid's 4-1 victory in the Champions League final by doing a Mario Balotelli.

After scoring the final goal of the game from the penalty spot, the superstar forward saw fit to copy AC Milan man's iconic celebration from Italy's 2-1 win over Germany in the semi-final of Euro 2012.

Diego Godin had given Atletico the lead in the first half, and they seemed to be heading to victory, before a dramatic stoppage time equaliser from Sergio Ramos took the game into extra-time.

Gareth Bale then put Real ahead in the 110th minute, before Ronaldo set up Marcelo for the third then tucked away the fourth from the spot.

He then immediately dispensed of his shirt and headed for the corner flag where his wild celebrations began.

The 29-year-old was booked for his troubles, but in all honesty it's hard to imagine that he was too bothered about it.Â
