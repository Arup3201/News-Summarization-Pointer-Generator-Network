That’s the thing with Chelsea. They can do it on a mild Monday night in Stoke. Unseasonably warm. That is the bad news for those betting on a white Christmas this year.

The good news for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea is that they will wake up on December 25 three points clear at the top of the Premier League table and playing like champions.

For Mourinho, this is a very good omen. He has been in pole position at Christmas on seven occasions in his managerial career, and each time he has won the title; twice at Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan, once at Real Madrid. It is a stunning record.

We are used to winners who come from down the field — and that was Manchester United’s style under Sir Alex Ferguson. Mourinho is different, a front-runner.

His campaigns start well, and on Monday night Chelsea looked the team to beat. Stoke were disappointing, but theirs was still a robust challenge, and plenty of good teams will lose here. This place hasn’t changed all that much from the Tony Pulis days, as Eden Hazard’s battered legs will confirm.

Stoke present a significant physical challenge and it is easy to see why teams with fainter hearts have a problem here. At Anfield on Sunday, Arsenal couldn’t find a defender who wanted to head away a 96th-minute Liverpool corner; Chelsea often had two men jumping to make the same clearance.

There are stronger attacking forces than Stoke, but this was still an impressive rearguard action, seeing off a second-half bombardment. Chelsea scored after two minutes. That is a hell of a long time to defend a 1-0 lead away from home.

Stoke rode their luck, could have given away a penalty when Ryan Shawcross fouled Cesc Fabregas, and Chelsea had the best chances of the night. But Mark Hughes’s men were still in there fighting until 12 minutes from the end. Hughes upped the tempo and the ante with substitutions and every half-chance brought a mighty roar. Chelsea sucked it all up, and then swatted Stoke away with a second goal to put the match beyond reach.

Fabregas made certain of victory with a goal that had a small degree of good fortune, but it was no more than he and Chelsea deserved. His build-up play with Hazard was typically precise, but he took the finish off the toes of Diego Costa and seemed to scuff his shot, which squirmed in at the far post.

Stoke had the odd shot from range but the stadium was mute and half-empty by the end. Chelsea are too smart and too good to lay on a grandstand finish. They more than had the measure of Stoke.

The goal that set them on their way came from the first attack of the game. A lovely move saw Fabregas feed Hazard and the ball slipped to Branislav Ivanovic on the overlap, his shot charged down, but winning a corner.

Fabregas curled it in and had Geoff Cameron kept his eyes on the delivery, he may have been in a better position to head it away. Instead he had decided to enter Strictly Come Grappling with Terry, in and out of hold, nice top line, Len would have loved it. Terry then spoiled the routine by ignoring his partner and heading the ball past Asmir Begovic in Stoke’s goal.

It could have been more were it not for the unlikeliest sight — two sitters missed by the fearsome Costa, one in each half. The first came in the 32nd minute when a full-blooded tackle by the outstanding Nemanja Matic sent the ball into the path of Fabregas. He thought quickly and played it into Costa, who beat the offside trap and sped towards goal.

At the start of the season you would have put your house on him scoring, but Costa steered his low finish narrowly wide of the far post.The second was teed up nicely by Andre Schurrle with seven minutes remaining. Costa was spare at the far post, but Begovic smothered.

Even factoring in these errors, it was still a mightily impressive win. Chelsea have the stuff of champions right now and in Matic, Fabregas and Hazard three of the most important footballers in the English game.

Matic was voted man of the match and understandably so given the battle in the heart of the pitch, but Fabregas is on course to break Thierry Henry’s record of 20 assists in a Premier League season, and Hazard was simply the bravest soul out there.

Stoke tried to kick him into submission, and failed. He never stopped taking them on, never stopped probing, teasing, testing them to the limit. By the time his brutal treatment saw him limp down the tunnel, injury-time was being played and the match was won. Yet Hazard deserved better from referee Neil Swarbrick; indeed, the same could be said for good footballers everywhere.

Stoke manager Hughes has a well developed chip on the shoulder about the treatment his team receive from referees, but heaven knows why on this evidence.

With 20 minutes gone, right back Phil Bardsley was lucky to still be on the field after two poor tackles on Hazard. The first was a booking, the second arguably a straight red. Bardsley received nothing initially, and then a limp-wristed yellow from the ineffectual Swarbrick. Mourinho was rightly furious.

Any bad behaviour that is not stopped is encouraged, so Swarbrick must take his share of the blame for the treatment Hazard received. The Belgian is a candidate for Footballer of the Year, and Bardsley had clearly made it his mission to test his mettle.

In the 14th minute, he went in high. That was the moment when Swarbrick should have offered protection. It was a yellow-card challenge, no more, but it would have put Bardsley and Stoke on notice. Yet he let it go with just a free-kick and six minutes later Bardsley could have ended Hazard’s participation in the game, maybe even the season.

Some tackles look worse than they are. This one didn’t. It looked exactly what it was: late, high, reckless, hitting Hazard at full pelt and launching him into the air.

Swarbrick could easily have made amends for his earlier leniency. Instead, he produced an overdue yellow. Mourinho looked fit to burst, so too Hughes — although he was fortunate to still be managing 11 men.

The pair exchanged words and Mourinho appeared to be suggesting — without irony — that Hughes had too much to say. He had a point, though. Hughes is a ball of discontent in the technical area, always unhappy with some perceived injustice or slight, often without cause.

He moaned when Costa went down after a challenge by Shawcross, although replays showed the Spain striker had every reason. He appeared agitated when Bardsley was injured making a tackle on Hazard, but the Chelsea man most certainly did nothing wrong.

The play up Stoke’s end, Bardsley still floored, Hazard kicked the ball into touch to allow his adversary to receive treatment. A touch of class.

So it was a sad indictment of Swarbrick’s officiating that he ultimately allowed the best player to be kicked out of the game.

Jonathan Walters’ foul was not as blatant as Bardsley’s assault, but he clumsily trampled on Hazard’s heel late on and, after a literally lame attempt at continuing, the Chelsea man signalled he could not continue.

Would Walters have been as wanton had Swarbrick done his job sooner? The fans who accused Hazard of diving may feel pangs of guilt, too. Far from being a faker, he was the most courageous player out there. Anyone can kick. Getting kicked and going back for more: that takes guts.
