Jota cut inside, not an awful lot was on, and let fly. We had crept into the 92nd minute at Griffin Park and this frantic night looked destined to end all-square. Call Dan Burn’s deflection into his own net unfortunate, but Brentford will argue you make your own luck.

The place went wild. Facing their bitter rivals for the first time in the league since 1998, this was more than just three points. If they weren’t already, Mark Warburton’s side are firmly in the Championship mix.

And they know it. A snapshot of the table flashed up just after the final whistle. ‘Just look at that,’ beamed one fan. The Bees find themselves fourth in a division which includes Leeds United, Derby County and, of course, the Cottagers.

Harlee Dean’s calamitous slip had looked to gift the visitors all three points, but they rallied brilliantly to turn this on its head. The villain Dean equalised - sufficiently redeeming himself - and then Jota sealed what is their biggest win of an encouraging season.

‘It’s tremendous for all of us and so important for the supporters,’ Warburton said. ‘It was a packed house and a great place to be.

‘They deserve to be there.’

This was Brentford’s opportunity to show they mean business in English football’s second tier and nobody came away disappointed on a night Fulham were shaken.

These have been long, tortuous years for the Bees and Friday night under the lights felt very much like the outpouring of 16 seasons of frustration.

Simply put, Warburton’s side were superb. They buzzed, pressed and provided real moments of quality to suggest they are at home in the top six.

‘I’m disappointed to say the least,’ Fulham boss Kit Symons said. ‘We were poor first half but stayed in the game - weathered the storm. We got our noses in front and it’s galling to come away with nothing.’

Brentford are now making those who had previously sneered at them for being a gentle, harmless club sit up and take notice. Whether they would have enjoyed the same impact under Uwe Rosler is up for debate, but what these supporters know is that Warburton has put them back on the map.

The accusation levelled at Rosler - here and during his ultimately doomed spell at Wigan - is that he never took enough risks. The same can’t be said of his replacement. During a frantic start he had the foresight to switch wingers Alan Judge and Alex Pritchard, and that move almost paid off immediately.

Andre Gray was tenacious in unsettling the gangly Dan Burn out wide, surging beyond the central defender before clipping a ball to Pritchard. The away supporters behind that goal sensed the danger, wincing as the sea parted for the on-loan Spurs man, and were indebted to the brilliance of right back Elsad Zverotic who courageously threw himself at the goalbound effort to deflect wide. If there were any suggestions Brentford would find themselves overawed by the evening, that move dispelled them.

It was they who enjoyed the majority of possession, pinging the ball about as if it was they who had mixed it in the top flight years previously. Tony Craig watched his chance palmed over the bar by Marcus Bettinelli while Jan Toral’s diving header was tipped wide and Jonathan Douglas fluffed his lines six yards out.

Make no mistake, Symons’ men were flustered. But for a blocked Ross McCormack shot, they had barely ventured into the home third.

The intense Warburton has his players following. They press all over the pitch, but none more so than Gray, who skipped away from halfway after a Fulham to dangerously cross again.

This time the ball fell to holding midfielder Toumani Diagouraga bounding from his holding station, whose side-footed strike was superbly beaten away by Bettinelli before he saved superbly from a Judge free-kick. This might’ve been over by the break if it wasn’t for the goalkeeper.

And then a reminder of Fulham’s undoubted menace. McCormack scampered down the left and found Rodallega free eight yards out, but Button admirably pushed clear his header. The Colombian might’ve done better. McCormack’s rasping drive was well saved as the visitors showed flickers.

But the best chances came at the other end. Gray was thwarted by Bettinelli, having a night to remember before what seemed a sucker punch. The unchallenged Dean looked to play a ball up to halfway but slipped on impact, gifting possession to George Williams. Now the hosts were stretched. Dean’s parter Craig was left exposed, McCormack finding the unmarked Rodallega and this time he made no mistake.

‘It happens. We encourage the players to be brave,’ Warburton reasoned. ‘I don’t mind a mistake.’ Perhaps the single line tells you all you need to know about his team.

Warburton must have been annoyed had they not found the net beforehand given their dominance. Brentford had wasted their earlier chances before Dean’s vicious strike slammed its way past Bettinelli.

Then bedlam. Substitute Jota cut in from the right and saw his rather weak effort deflect beyond Bettinelli to send this pocket of the city absolutely potty. ‘They deserved the points,’ McCormack said. Never a truer word spoken.
