They look like the vanguard of an alien invasion fleet.

But these ‘UFOs’ hovering over the village of Fionnphort on the Isle of Mull have certainly come in peace.

Lenticular clouds are stationary, lens-shaped formations which can appear at high altitudes.

They have often been mistaken for UFOs because of their characteristic appearance and smooth, saucer-like shape – while bright colors are sometimes seen along their edges.

Similar clouds also turned up over Perthshire yesterday – where they assumed a shape more like that of Earth’s most famous spacecraft, the fictional Starship Enterprise.

The clouds – scientific name altocumulus lenticularis – are a  phenomenon seen in every country in the world where there are hills and moisture.

They are formed when a smooth, stable airflow strikes these hills and are sometimes found at extreme altitudes, composed of ice particles.

Just as a rock in a stream will form ripples downstream, a similar effect occurs in the air – with the clouds forming at the peaks of the waves.

You’re most likely to notice them in winter in the UK, especially if you live to the west of hills.

Glider pilots use these waves in the air to achieve high altitudes.
