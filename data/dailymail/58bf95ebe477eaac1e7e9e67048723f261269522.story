Wrongful dismissal: Former bank executive Raphael Geys could claim damages

A high-flying City banker who claimed that he was sacked for being ‘too successful’ today won a Supreme Court fight with his former employers.

Judges ruled that Raphael Geys, former managing director of European fixed income sales for French bank Societe Generale, could now claim damages for wrongful dismissal.

Mr Geys - who was employed by the bank’s London branch and claimed that he had been dismissed without cause - had already argued his case in the High Court and Court of Appeal.

The bank disputed his claims but a panel of five Supreme Court justices ruled in his favour by a 4-1 majority after a hearing in London.

Mr Geys will now claim around £10.1million in unpaid severance pay from Societe Generale.

He can also pursue the bank for damages worth 'several million euros' more for failing to ensure his bonuses were paid in a tax efficient manner.

One judge, Lady Hale, said ‘clear and unambiguous notification’ had not been given.

‘The bank could easily have done things properly,’ she added. ‘But for whatever reason they did not do so.’

Raphael Geys, an executive with Societe Generale, told the High Court in 2010 that during 
three highly lucrative years at the bank he doubled the income of his 
division from £184m to £394m.

But he was shocked when, he was summarily dismissed in November 2007.

He said he was ‘dismissed for being too successful’ because the bank considered provisions in his contract to be ‘too generous’.

The bank, France's second largest, offered him a £7m pay-off but 
Mr Geys, former managing director of European fixed income sales, sued.

Mr Geys’ lawyers said after today’s ruling by the Supreme Court, the highest court in the UK, that he had been vindicated.

‘This successful outcome for Mr Geys vindicates his decision to take his case to the UK’s highest court,’ said Tom Custance, partner at law firm Fox Williams.

‘The judgment has established several key points of employment law which protect the rights of the innocent party. It should be widely welcomed.’

Mr Custance said the ‘overall effect’ of the Supreme Court’s ruling was that Mr Geys would be entitled to a termination payment worth millions of pounds.

Mr Geys, whose 20-year career in investment banking includes stints at the London branches of UBS and Merrill Lynch , was headhunted by Societe Generale in 2005 although he warned the bank at the time it should consider employing a less senior and less expensive banker.

His bespoke remuneration package, which included an offshore "tax efficient" pay structure he says Societe Generale never implemented, was designed to persuade him to shelve plans to set up an entrepreneurial business with former Merrill Lynch colleagues.

He says the package was attractive because it was based on an entrepreneurial approach, with a formulaic bonus that could be wiped out if he failed to perform, a tax efficient wrapper and a generous termination deal if things did not work out. 

Societe Generale, he said, never expected him to meet the higher performance criteria.
