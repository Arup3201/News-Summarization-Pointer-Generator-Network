Paris has recorded an 8 per cent drop in the number of tourists targeted by muggers... but only after using police officers from other countries.

Amid mounting pressure to make the city safer for visitors, police announced that violent muggings at Paris’ principal tourist sites have dropped and physical attacks have fallen by 4.5 per cent in the opening nine months of 2014.

The announcement comes after the French capital launched a 26-point anti-crime strategy and brought in police officers from other European countries to beef up security at top attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, Champs-Elysees, Notre Dame Cathedral and the Louvre.

With about 30 million visitors a year, Paris police brought in reinforcements from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Romania to help to patrol areas visited by tourists.

It appears the plan is paying off as police announced this week that violent thefts against tourists from China, who are frequent targets for the City of Love’s criminals, have dropped by 25 per cent in 2014 compared to the same nine-month period in 2013. 

There has been a 13 per cent drop in violent thefts targeting tourists at the Louvre, while the area around the Champs-Elysees has seen a 24 per cent drop in thefts and 22 per cent drop in minor injuries attributed to violence, The Local reported.

Thefts were down by six per cent in Montmartre and around Notre Dame Cathedral.

Part of the strategy is focusing on Eastern European gangs, who were believed to be responsible for much of the thefts from tourists.

Police said the number of Eastern Europeans who have been arrested for crimes has dropped by nearly a quarter.

Earlier this year Paris officials announced that police from China would be brought in to support the crackdown, but the plan has been put on hold.
