Work is to begin on filling a sink hole that has swallowed the grave of a soldier called Private Ryan in a military cemetery.

The grave, in the Pembroke Dock war cemetery, Wales' only military graveyard, collapsed into a 20ft hole after a prolonged spell of heavy rain caused the limestone layer beneath the coffin to shift.

And now military
 chiefs are working to prevent the headstone collapsing into the 
pit. Five other graves are also thought to be at risk of falling into 
the cavern.

Final resting place: Private Ryan's grave has lain undisturbed in the corner of this cemetery for nearly a century after he died in England during the First World War in 1915

The grave, in the Pembroke Dock war cemetery, Wales' only military graveyard, collapsed into a 20ft hole after a prolonged spell of heavy rain caused the limestone layer beneath the coffin to shift

The soldier, Private Francis Ryan, of
 the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, King's (Liverpool Regiment), was born in 
Longford in Ireland in 1875 and died in 1915, aged 40.

His army unit never served on the 
frontline during the First World War, and it is thought the serviceman 
may have died after an accident during a training exercise. His soldier number was 3/10511.

The
 6ft-wide and 20ft-deep sinkhole has left a gaping circular hole in the 
ground with only rocks and tree roots visible to visitors of the war 
cemetery.

The
 Ministry of Defence has been unable to trace any living relatives of 
the deceased serviceman, whose name echoes the title of Tom Hanks' 
Second World War film.

The MoD has said it has no plans to exhume the grave but instead intends to fill the hole to prevent it growing.

A
 spokesman said: 'Work to fill the sink hole will begin next week and 
will be completed by the end of March. The chosen option does not 
involve exhumation.'

Regiment: The 3rd Battalion Kings Liverpool Regiment which Private Ryan served in is seen here parading on Margate seafront in 1915. It is unclear exactly where and how Private Ryan died

Currently, the hole is covered with just a protective metal grille to deter tomb raiders.

The west Wales graveyard will host events to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War in August.

Five other military graves are in danger 
beside the sinkhole with the names J O’Brien, Private J McGuiness, 
Gunner William Henry Hurley, Private Charles Joseph Duffy and Private E 
Sullivan.

The
 cemetery is the final resting place for 23 Commonwealth servicemen 
killed during the First World War and 51 who died during the Second 
World War.

It was closed for several months until a protective metal fence was erected around the six 'at risk' graves last week.

The
 sinkhole was caused by natural water erosion through the limestone 
beneath Private Ryan’s grave - and his remains are hidden beneath the 
fallen mud and rubble.

The affected section has been cordoned off to the public while work to make the graves safe continues.

The MoD has so far failed to trace a living relative of Private Ryan - who was born in Longford, Ireland, in 1875

Pembroke Dock district Parade Marshal 
David Boswell said yesterday: 'The graveyard is a monument to the Army, Navy and 
Artillery stationed here during the First World War.

'But unfortunately Mother Nature has taken over and when she opens up her body there is not much you can do.

'It’s
 a shame it’s happened but the MoD have looked into it and are trying to
 restore the grave to its original condition as soon as possible.

'This is the only military cemetery in
 Wales so it will be nice to have it re-opened and ready for the 
centenary of the First World War.

'We
 will be holding a service of remembrance in August to mark the 
centenary and it will be nice to have the cemetery back to its best so 
we can remember our fallen.'
