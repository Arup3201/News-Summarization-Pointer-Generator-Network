Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney made the most of the last day of the school holidays, splashing out on a visit to the Blue Planet Aquarium in Ellesmere Port with his sons Kai and Klay.  

The 29-year-old, who won his 100th England cap in November last year, took time to sign autographs and pose for photographs, including a group shot with the aquarium's clownfish mascot, Charlie, which Rooney later posted on his official Instagram account.

Speaking to The Chester Chronicle, a spokesman for the aquarium said: 'The whole family seemed to have a really good time and Wayne was more than happy to chat to staff and visitors.' 

'It was a surprise visit for us and Charlie the clownfish couldn't resist the chance to get a picture with the England ace.' 

Wayne Rooney has scored eight goals in 16 Premier League games for Manchester United this season 

Rooney isn't the first footballer to have visited the aquarium. Manchester City and Spain playmaker David Silva visited last year as part of his role as an ambassador for Anfi, a luxury holiday company based in his hometown of Arguineguin.
