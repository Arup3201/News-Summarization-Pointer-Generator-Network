Rick Santorum and his wife Karen have revealed the agony they faced when their daughter was born disabled and had a very low chance of survival. 

Bella was diagnosed with Trisomy 18 - a condition potentially more life-threatening than Down Syndrome - which doctors said is 'incompatible with life' and has a very low rate of survival.

The former US Senator, was initially 'at peace' with whether his daughter lived or died right after his daughter was born, believing he saw her as 'less of a person'.

He questioned whether he would love her the same as his six other children, while receiving pamphlets for coffins and grave sites as they left the hospital. 

But as the family prepares for her seventh birthday, they say every day is a blessing and have come to terms with the reality that they do not know how long they will have their beloved daughter for.

Reaction: Rick Santorum pictured with his daughter Bella - who has the debilitating condition Trisomy 18 - was 'at peace' with whether his daughter lived or died when she was born 

They have chronicled their story in a book titled Bella's Gift which is set to be released on Tuesday 

The pair hope it may act as guidance for other families in similar situations.

The Republican politician, who revealed the heartbreak surrounding his daughter's debilitating illness during his 2012 presidential campaign, told The Washington Post when Bella was born he initially thought: 'The best thing I could do was to treat her differently and not love her'. 

The youngster was released from the neo-natal unit and transferred to a hospice just 10 days after she was born - a paradox Karen described as 'painful'.  

Then, when she was strapped to gurney in an emergency room aged just five months, he had an epiphany.

He added: 'I remember holding that finger, looking at her and realizing what I had done.' He admitted to The Post he had seen Bella as 'less of a person'.

Preconceptions: When Bella was born the former US Senator initially thought: 'The best thing I could do was to treat her differently and not love her'

Rick described how, because of the dire outlook, they were given pamphlets about coffins and grave sites soon after Bella was born while friends sent them letters of sympathy rather than congratulations. 

When he was putting together the crib, he told his teenage daughter Elizabeth to save the box, in case they needed it to send the bed back to the store - because they weren't sure 

A doctor is also believed to have told the family: 'You have to let her go. Statistically, there's no hope here.' He also referred to her as a 'baby' rather than by name, 

Only half of those born with the disorder survive a week and less than 10 per cent reach their first birthday. 

However Bella is nearly seven and her father has adapted fatherhood to life with her.

Mr Santorum, pictured with Bella in 2011, described how one doctor told the family: 'You have to let her go'

Karen describes how the youngster 'squeals' when she sees her father arrive home and now has him 'wrapped around her little finger'. 

She added that if Rick has another shot at the presidency, the family may fair better as the children are older and Bella's condition is more stable. However it is a mystery as to why she is still alive.  

He told The Post: 'Bella gave me the ability to talk about the dignity of every human life without talking about abortion, because there is a bigger issue.

Rick added: 'Even if we don’t know how long we’re going to have Bella, we’re blessed. We’re just blessed every day. We don’t live on the edge. But we realize what we’re dealing with, and there’s all sorts of things that can happen.' 

Trisomy 18 is caused by an error in cell division, known as meiotic disjunction.

All babies are born with 46 chromosomes - 23 from the father and 23 from the mother.  A trisomy occurs when the baby has three number 18 chromosomes instead of the normal two.

Mr Santorum has previously said he often has to catch himself to stop from tears when talking or thinking about Bella.

Mr Santorum has largely kept his daughter off the campaign schedules, preferring her to stay home with her mother.
