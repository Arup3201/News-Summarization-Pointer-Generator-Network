Lord Tebbit suggested sales of junk food would be higher in areas where food banks are most popular

People use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, Lord Tebbit claimed yesterday.

The former Cabinet minister said there was a ‘near infinite demand’ for anything free.

The Tory peer was speaking in a House of Lords debate about food banks – which Labour claim are booming because Coalition austerity policies leave many people unable to make ends meet.

But Lord Tebbit suggested more people were using them because the number of banks has increased and they would prefer not to pay for food.

It follows research showing the number of families claiming they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years – as the number of food banks has risen.

The peer said: ‘There is always a near infinite demand for valuable goods that are given away free.

‘One can even notice it in the catering departments of this building. If food is given away at prices grossly below the markets more is used.’

He invited environment minister Lord de Mauley to ‘initiate some research into the sales of junk food in areas where  people are living for their basic food on the food banks’. The minister declined.

Earlier this month Tory welfare minister Lord Freud said the demand for food banks was difficult to understand.

‘Clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly,’ he added. ‘However, it is very hard to know why people go to them.’

The intervention came after a series of peers in the House of Lords had called on the Government to tackle the scale of food bank usage in the UK.

Lord Palmer, an independent crossbench peer, said it was a ‘scandal in today’s society that food banks have to exist at all’.

Labour peers’ leader Baroness Royall 
of Blaisdon said food banks in the South West gave aid to more than 
40,000 adults and 20,000 children last year.

She
 described it as down to ‘desperate pressing demand due to a cost of 
living crisis’ and called for Lord de Mauley to visit one.

Lord de Mauley said he had visited a food bank and they were run by ‘wonderful people and donated to by hugely generous folk’.

The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need

‘They perform a very valuable service distributing food to people who really need it and they tend to operate at a local level,’ he said.

‘Britain has a great tradition of charitable giving and I think it would be a bad day when we started to interfere with that.’

Only 8.1 per cent of Britons admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007

Last
 year Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked outrage when he 
claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks 
because of their own ‘decisions’.

He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.

‘Those
 pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which 
mean they are not best able to manage their finances.

‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’

A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found Britons were among the least likely in the developed world to say there were times when they could not afford food, an international report found.

Only 8.1 per cent reported this in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 – before the economic crisis and when Labour was in power.

The study, which represents industrialised nations, flies in the face of Left-wing claims that cuts in public spending are leaving thousands of families going hungry.

The number of food banks has increased over the past few years, with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them.

It emerged this month that more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £3million to the taxpayer.

While most town halls paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food.
