They are no strangers to the official portrait or, indeed, the wax figurine, but now Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia have been immortalised in another substance entirely - chocolate.

The life-size statues of the Spanish royals are the work of Córdoba bakery, Galleros Artesanos, and join a group that also includes Pope Francis and former Spanish king, Juan-Carlos.

Making the enormous sculptures required a truly king-sized amount of chocolate - 340kg for Felipe and 320kg for Letizia.

Juan-Carlos proved the heaviest hitter in chocolate terms, with a hefty 450kg of the sweet stuff needed for his likeness.

Pope Francis, whose sculpture is, unlike the others, made from white chocolate, required an impressive 350kg.

Lightest is former queen Sofia, whose statue needed just 280kg of chocolate to complete.

Sadly for those who fancy finding King Felipe in their stockings, the sculptures are one-offs and will be polished off by the children of Galleros Artesanos' owner come Christmas Day.

The sculptures, some of which were first unveiled during Christmas 2013, aren't the first time the Spanish royals have found themselves on the end of an unusual artistic tribute.

In October, the Wax Museum in Madrid revealed their latest likenesses of the Spanish royal family - but with rather less success than the Galleros Artesanos.

Tradition: A few years ago the patisserie owners decided to celebrate Christmas time by creating life size copies of prominent personalities made of chocolate with two patisserie chefs working for three months on each sculpture

Lowlights included a bizarre frozen-faced take on Letizia and a creepy version of the usually adorable Infanta Leonor.

Odd-looking waxworks aren't only a problem for the Spanish royal family, however, with the British royals also immortalised in a series of terrible statues.

Prince Harry, who now boasts an updated and considerably more lifelike waxwork at Madame Tussaud's in London, was, until recently, another victim of a royal waxwork disaster.

Not only did the sculpture have hair that was noticeably lighter than the real Harry's copper hue, the figure also looked considerably more like Barbie's boyfriend Ken than the prince.

Other horrible royal sculptures include the terrifying take on the Duchess of Cornwall that once graced Madame Tussaud's and an unusual rendering of the Prince of Wales that looked more like a Spitting Image puppet than the royal himself.

Family: Along with Felipe and co, the museum has made waxworks of King Juan-Carlos and Queen Silvia

Frightening: The Spanish royals aren't the only ones to be afflicted by bad waxworks as this one proves

Back to normal: The real Camilla is much prettier (and far less frightening) than her wax doppelganger

Much better: The real royals are both better looking and a little more rugged than the waxworks

One royal who has had no such problems with waxwork tributes is the Queen, whose Madame Tussaud's sculpture is updated regularly to ensure it looks as close to the real thing as possible.

The current version was made to coincide with the Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and wears a stunning silver lace dress embroidered with 53,000 Swarovski crystals.

Another set of royals to boast accurate waxworks are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, whose likenesses first entered the waxwork museum shortly after their wedding in 2011.

Although the Duchess' smile does look slightly fixed, her long chestnut locks are spot on as is the dress - a copy of the blue Issa number worn to announce her engagement to Prince William.

Like Prince Harry, the royal couple got a makeover this year, with Kate now sporting a pretty teal dress and a regal swept-back hairdo. 

Big improvement: A new Prince Harry sculpture that looks far more like the real thing was recently unveiled

No problem: The Queen's waxwork is regularly updated and wears a dress that boasts 53,000 crystals

New look: The latest statues of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were unveiled in July
