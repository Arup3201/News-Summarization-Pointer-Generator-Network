Reverend Al Sharpton, who once tipped the scales at 305 pounds, regularly fat-shames friends and followers, calling them 'jumbo' and expressing his disgust at their eating habits, it has been claimed.

The civil rights leader, who hosts MSNBC's 'Politics Nation', regularly derides people in sermons and conversations at his Harlem-based organization, the National Action Network, The Smoking Gun reported. The website cited examples between March and July.

'Since I lost weight, I talk about 
fat folk real bad,' Sharpton, who has lost 167 pounds, reportedly said at a meeting for a fashion show 
organized by his daughter, Ashley, in April.

'I like keeping fat folk 
around me so I can just talk about them.'

Half the man: Rev Al Sharpton, pictured left earlier this month and right in 1988, once weighed more than 300 pounds. He has now turned on other obese people to deride them for their weight, according to reports

He also mimicked some 'jumbo' women who were not asked to model in the show because of their sizes, saying: '"Why Ashley didn't have me model?" 'Cause you too fat!'

In another incident, 59-year-old Sharpton described his horror at seeing a woman eat half a fried chicken, two sides and a dessert at a soul-food restaurant in Harlem.

She then 'had the nerve' to ask for Sweet'N Low in her drink.

'I couldn't take it anymore,' Sharpton said, TSG reported, 'and said "Miss, lemme ask you something. All of that you took, what do you need 
Sweet'N Low? I mean, you just make yourself feel better? You might as 
well pour the whole bag of sugar in the cup".'

Heavier days: Sharpton is pictured in July 1992 - ten years before he shed nearly 170 pounds

Slimmer: Sharpton, pictured in 2004, lost 30 pounds during a hunger strike in 2001 and then became vegan

Sharpton, who TSG notes has easy access to multiple healthy options beneath his Manhattan building, also often tells followers that they should be skipping meals.

'A lot of y'all ain't doing nothing but 
going to lunch,' he reportedly told protesters at a rally against Boko Haram outside the United Nations in May.

'And most of y'all don't need no lunch. Y'all need to 
walk over to the UN and lose some weight anyhow.'

And after seeing a once-slim high school friend who had piled on the pounds in March, he quipped: 'Every fine girl is two big Whoppers away from being obese', according to TSG.

Svelte: Sharpton now weighs just 138 pounds and reportedly now ridicules 'jumbo' people

The National Action Network and Rev. Sharpton have not yet responded to a request for comment.

Sharpton, who once squeezed himself 
into plus-sized tracksuits, lost 30 pounds during a prison hunger strike
 in 2001 when he was locked up for protesting against the government 
using Vieques Island in Puerto Rico for bombing exercises.

But when he left, he said he wasn't able to keep that weight off so realized he needed more exercise and a better diet to slim down.

He became vegan apart from eating fish twice a week and refused to eat after 6pm. He eventually dropped to 138 pounds, meaning he shed 167 pounds in total.
