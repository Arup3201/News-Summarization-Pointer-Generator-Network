'Unwelcome advances': An independent report leaked today makes serious allegations about the sexual conduct of MP Mike Hancock

Nick Clegg was last night struggling to contain another sex scandal after his party tried to suppress ‘credible’ allegations of misconduct by an MP.

The Liberal Democrats finally suspended Mike Hancock yesterday, more than three years after a vulnerable constituent first complained about him.

Incredibly, Mr Clegg acted only after an   independent report by a QC,  who found prima facie evidence that the 67-year-old MP was guilty of ‘serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour’, was leaked online.

This is despite the fact the complainant, known only as Annie or AH, wrote to Mr Clegg in March 2011 about her frustrations over the case.

Her letter said: ‘I am also deeply upset that as the Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats, you have done nothing to oust this man from politics. He cannot be trusted and he is a liability to women, the public and also your party. His conduct should be a matter for you as leader of the party.’

The report into Mr Hancock’s conduct was given to the party last August. He had resigned the Lib Dem whip last June after the woman threatened to sue.

But the report was never published and on Tuesday the Lib Dem-controlled council in Portsmouth – where Mr Hancock is also a councillor – voted to keep it under wraps. It emerged only when political internet blogger ‘Guido Fawkes’ published it yesterday.

In his report, Nigel Pascoe QC also says he could see no reason why it should not be published straight away.

Last night critics asked how it was possible that the party leadership had done nothing to discipline the married MP for so long – and had not even asked to see the report into one of their MPs until yesterday.

Coming at the height of the furore engulfing Lord Rennard – who is refusing to apologise for a string of sex allegations by female party members – the case will ingrain the idea that Mr Clegg has little or no grip on his party.

'You are special and sexy':  Liberal Democrat MP Mike Hancock allegedly sent a string of lewd texts containing filthy comments to woman, who had mental health problems and had previously been sexually abused

The allegations against Mr Hancock, MP for Portsmouth South, are even more serious than those against Lord Rennard.

The alleged victim accused the father of two – who was more than 30 years her senior – of exposing himself in front of her,  ‘forcibly’ kissing her until she had red marks on her arms, and begging her to perform sex acts upon him.

Mr Pascoe found that the vulnerable constituent – who had a personality disorder and had been sexually abused as a child – had also been bombarded by lewd text messages from Mr Hancock for months.

On a later occasion he allegedly took her to the House of Commons where he ‘kept topping her wine up’ and ‘ran his fingers through her hair’. He bought her gifts, including a House of Commons teddy bear – which he sprayed with his aftershave and asked her to sleep with.

When Annie was told that the police were not going to prosecute she said she felt like shooting herself.

Mr Hancock was arrested in 2010 in connection with the allegations, but Hampshire Police decided there was not enough evidence to mount a criminal case. A civil case is pending in the High Court.

Portsmouth Council, which commissioned the report, said its legal advice was that it could not publish the report until that case had been completed. But Mr Pascoe said that, in his view, there was no reason why it should not be published.

It is not the first time Mr Hancock has been embroiled in a sex scandal. Four years ago an affair with researcher Katia Zatulieveter was exposed

In addition, a Lib Dem spokesman said last night that the leadership had not even seen the QC’s report until yesterday. ‘Given Nigel Pascoe QC’s conclusions in his report, we have immediately suspended Mike Hancock’s membership of the party,’ he said.

Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: ‘The Lib Dems are descending into chaos. This case once again sends out an appalling message to women. Nick Clegg needs to stop dithering and show some leadership.’

It is not the first time Mr Hancock has been embroiled in a sex scandal. Four years ago an affair with Russian researcher Katia Zatulieveter, 27, was exposed. She worked for him in the Commons and was accused of spying for Moscow – but the allegations were never proved.

The damning report into the latest scandal includes interviews with AH about the events of early 2010, when she was aged 35.

The alleged victim, who gave evidence under oath, said of Mr Hancock: ‘He forcibly kissed me. He grabbed my arms and he stuck his tongue down my throat.’ On another occasion, she said, Mr

Hancock undid his belt and exposed himself. ‘I said, “put it away, I think you are disgusting and you need some help; you have a sexual problem”,’ the report said.

The alleged victim told the QC: ‘That was the worst time, this really affected me.’

Party split: Lord Rennard denies any wrongdoing and has refused to apologise for the distress caused to women who allege that they were groped by him

In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe said: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock.

‘I am of the clear view that her account if credible and merits both compassion and respect.’

Mr Pascoe called on the authorities to decide whether criminal proceedings should start again, adding: ‘The time for equivocation has ended. These matters should have been addressed definitively a long time ago in the interests of AH and Mr Hancock.’

Mr Hancock is also a city councillor in Portsmouth and still represents the Liberal Democrats at City Hall

Claims: Mike Hancock (pictured) has repeatedly denied claims he sent sexy texts and made sexual advances towards a troubled female constituent

The woman had originally contacted Mr Hancock over a dispute about noisy neighbours.

She
 told the solicitor that Mr Hancock knew she had mental health problems.
 She had been abused ‘in a family setting’ between the ages of ten and 
14, raped at 18, and had suffered from eating disorders since the age of
 14.

Last night Mr Pascoe said he was disappointed that only a redacted version of the report had come to light, adding: ‘It would be better for my full report to be published sooner rather than later,’ he said.

Before the suspension was announced, a spokesman for Mr Hancock said: ‘These matters have twice been looked at by the police, first in 2010, and in conjunction with the CPS, they have found that there is no case for Mr Hancock to answer and have taken no further action.

‘As this is an ongoing legal case, it not appropriate for Mike to give a running commentary.’

A Lib Dem source last night denied the report had been suppressed.

‘Portsmouth councillors were advised by the city solicitors that the report should not be published until the outcome of the civil action,’ he said.

‘This was not a political decision.’
