Gambian President Yahya Jammeh following his reelection in Banjul, Gambia (file).

The West African nation of The Gambia 
is withdrawing from the Commonwealth, saying it will 
'never be a member of any neo-colonial institution'.

It was not clear what triggered the decision to leave the 54-nation association of countries but despotic
President Yahya Jammeh - who likes to be called His Excellency Sheikh 
Professor Doctor President - apparently made the decision on a whim.

He is the first leader to do so unilaterally since President Robert Mugabe chose to pull Zimbabwe out ten years ago.

Mr Jammeh, who claims to have developed a cure for Aids, has been criticised in the past by Britain for human rights abuses, including when he executed nine death-row inmates by firing squad in August of last year.

Rights groups such as Amnesty International have also criticised the Gambian government for cracking down on dissent and targeting political opponents and sexual minorities for arrest and detention, among other alleged abuses.

The move to leave the association, largely made up of former British colonies, was announced in a statement yesterday, just six weeks before the club's biennial summit.

The gathering, to be held in Sri Lanka on November 16, will be opened by the Prince of Wales. He will be joined by David Cameron and about 50 other heads of state.

The Foreign Office told MailOnline: 'Decisions on Commonwealth membership are a matter for each member government.

'We would very much regret Gambia, or any other country, deciding to leave the Commonwealth.'

It is not thought the decision would affect Britons travelling to the country, which has become a popular tourist destination for UK nationals.

Bakary Dabo, former vice president of Gambia and chairman of the country's campaign for democratic change, said the Gambian people are generally 'very happy' to be part of the Commonwealth.

He said Gambian authorities had 
recently been seeking attention and 'picking up war against poorly 
specified enemies called 'western powers'.

He
told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This has been building up over the
past few years and accelerated, especially as the last week he (Mr 
Jammeh) was at the UN General Assembly and used his time located to him 
to go into some long rambling about the "western powers" and their supposed hegemonic plans around the world.'

Mr Jammeh's reign since he seized power in a coup 19 years ago has been dogged by controversy and sheer eccentricity.

Just last month in a speech at the UN, he claimed homosexuals were 'very evil' and declared that any who did not leave The Gambia would be beheaded.

Last year, he chose to mark the Muslim
festival of Eid, a time traditionally honoured with gestures of 
clemency, by ordering the execution of 38 prisoners. He later reversed 
his decision.

Weeks later, 
he then announced capital punishment would be carried out 'to the 
letter' because 'there is no way my government will allow 99 per cent of
the population to be held to ransom by criminals'.

Eight men and one woman held in prison near Gambia's capital, Banjul, were executed by firing squad four days later.

In 2009, Jammeh's administration rounded up nearly 1,000 people last year in a 'witch hunt' that spanned the nation of two million after he declared someone had killed his aunt by casting a spell on her.

Authorities forced the supposed witches to drink a hallucinogen that caused diarrhoea and vomiting.

The unidentified liquid led to serious kidney problems and two people died after the forced treatment, according to the international human rights group Amnesty International.

And in 2007, the ruler claimed to have developed his own cure for Aids and insisted that patients stop taking their anti-retroviral medications so his herbal rub and banana cure could take effect.

It is not known what happened to them.

Mr Jammeh seized power from Sir Dawda Jawara in a military coup in 1994 when he was a lieutenant.
