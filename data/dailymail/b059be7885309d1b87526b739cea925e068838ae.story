Brazil superstar Neymar feared he was paralysed after being kneed in the back by Colombia’s Juan Zuniga.

Neymar’s anguish was revealed yesterday by Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari who told Marca newspaper: ‘Marcelo ran up to Neymar and asked him how he was feeling and he told him, “I can’t feel my legs”.’

Scans later revealed he had fractured a vertebra, ruling him out of the rest of the World Cup.

Neymar’s absence is a major blow to Brazil as they prepare to take on Germany in Tuesday's semi-final.

Brazil team doctor Jose Luiz Runco 
said Neymar would be out for about six weeks and added: ‘He does not 
have any neurological injury that would compromise his life as an 
athlete or a human being. He will be able to pass, to run.’

Neymar thanked his team-mates for 
their support in an emotional video recorded at the team’s 
training ground before he was flown home to Guaruja by helicopter to 
begin his rehabilitation.

But Scolari knows the importance of 
Neymar to the squad and has asked the 22-year-old to come to Belo 
Horizonte and cheer the team on against Germany.

‘He will be with us if he can, on the 
bench or in the stands,’ the former Chelsea manager said. ‘It all will 
depend on how he is.’

As well as being without Neymar, 
Scolari will probably have to replace Thiago Silva, who is unlikely to 
win an appeal against his second booking of the tournament during the 
2-1 victory against Colombia on Friday.

3 - Karim Benzema (France), Arjen Robben (Holland), Enner Valencia (Ecuador), Robin van Persie (Holland), Xherdan Shaqiri (Switzerland)

Those in italic are out of the World Cup through injury or elimination.

But the biggest task for Scolari is 
filling the gap left by Neymar, who was Brazil’s top scorer at the World
 Cup with four goals.

‘It’s equivalent to a catastrophe,’ 
Scolari said. ‘Neymar is our reference. He is a player that would make 
the difference in any team. We have lost the one player we did not want 
to lose.’

The Brazilian federation confirmed 
yesterday that team psychologist Regina Brandao would visit the training
 ground after Scolari admitted he found the ordeal of seeing his best 
player injured hard to take.

‘It was a big shock,’ he said. ‘The 
image of Neymar being carried off a stretcher towards the plane, the 
difficulties, the tears.’

But Bastian Schweinsteiger has warned Germany the injury to Neymar could galvanise Brazil.

‘We are all very sad Neymar can’t play,’ he said. ‘It is always best if all the big players are on the pitch for the big games.

‘But the loss of Neymar can create strength and weld together the Brazilian team.’
