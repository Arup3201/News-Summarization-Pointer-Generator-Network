There are historical allies and there are strong allies, and John Kerry may have confused the two yesterday when he hailed France as America’s oldest friend.

It was supposed to be a calculated snub to Britain, of course.

With a few exceptions, in the past 100 years it’s become a rule of thumb that America no longer goes to war without Britain at its side.

Francophile: Secretary of State John Kerry was mocked for his Francophilia during the 2004 presidential race. Yesterday he called them America's 'oldest ally' as he hailed the government for supporting Syria strikes

So the UK’s failure to follow the US into action over Syria inevitably stung in Washington, prompting Mr Kerry to cosy up to France.

But in reality Americans tend to mistrust the French even more than the British do. Famously, Americans refer to them as ‘cheese-eating surrender monkeys’.

And French-speaking Mr Kerry was mocked for his Francophilia during the 2004 presidential race.

The relationship had started well. 
French troops and ships under the Marquis de Lafayette provided crucial 
help during America’s war of independence from Britain.

Links were strengthened by Founding Father Thomas Jefferson, who lived in Paris as US ambassador.

A good start: French forces helped Americans secede from Britain and Founding Father Thomas Jefferson (pictured) lived for a while in Paris...

But the friendship crumpled when Napoleon took power and resented America’s treaty-making with Britain. By 1798 a state of undeclared war existed between the two former allies.

In the 1840s, France supported Texas’s moves for independence from the US and blocked American moves to gain control of California.

The situation became even worse during
the American Civil War. While France was technically neutral, Napoleon 
III favoured the Confederates.

It managed to antagonise the US further by installing the Austrian archduke Maximilian of Hapsburg on the throne of Mexico.

America, which wanted French troops out of Mexico, refused to recognise the government.

In the 20th century France and the 
United States got on a little better, but relations were strained 
between Franklin D Roosevelt and Charles de Gaulle during the Second 
World War.

De Gaulle and his
Free French refused to take part in the Normandy landings but the 
Allies still generously allowed French troops to be the first to 
liberate Paris.

After De Gaulle became president, he clashed with the US over France’s decision to build its own nuclear weapons.

... but Napoleon, left, resented America's treaty-making with Britain in the 18th century, while in the 20th, President Charles de Gaulle, right, clashed with the U.S. over nuclear weapons and took his country out of Nato

In 1966, France pulled its forces out of Nato and kicked the US-led organisation out of its HQ at Fontainebleau.

France earned its ‘surrender monkey’ moniker during the 2003 US invasion of Iraq.

The French opposed a UN resolution authorising the invasion and, in retaliation, anti-French feeling swept across the US with public campaigns to boycott French goods.

History of French relations with U.S. hardly one of unwavering support
