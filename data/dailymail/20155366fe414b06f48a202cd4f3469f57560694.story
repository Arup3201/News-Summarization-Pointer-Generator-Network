George Remus, a Cincinatti lawyer, was known as 'King of the Bootleggers' and may have been the inspiration behind F. Scott Fitzgerald's Gatsby

A Cincinnati lawyer who was known as 'King of the Bootleggers' and turned to crime after noticing his clients were getting rich may have been the real life inspiration behind The Great Gatsby.

George Remus was born in Germany in 1874, before his family moved to Chicago when he was five.

After supporting his family by working in a pharmacy from the age of 14, he bought the pharmacy at 19, expanded and bought another in his early twenties before deciding to become a lawyer aged 24.

He specialised in criminal defence, particularly in murder cases and by 1920 he was earning $50,000 a year - a huge amount at the time.

In 1920 Remus divorced his first wife Lillian after embarking on an affair with his legal secretary, Augusta Imogene Holmes, whom he subsequently married.

That year U.S. Congress decided to ban toting or selling alcohol - but bizarrely, drinking was still allowed.

'Remus soon noticed the criminals he was defending  were getting rich off bootlegging,' Roy Hotchkiss of the Price Hill Historical Society told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

'He saw all this money and thought he'd better get in on the action.'

Remus began studying the Volstead Act – the law that enforced Prohibition – and soon found several loopholes.

His pharmaceutical background came in handy when he realized the loopholes meant he could buy distilleries and pharmacies to sell 'bonded' liquor to himself under government licenses for 'medicinal' purposes.

Remus's employees would then 'steal' his liquor so he could sell it on illegally.

By this point he had moved to Cincinnati and bought up most of the whiskey manufacturers.

In less than three years Remus made $40 million - in today's currency  almost $900 million.

George Remus shared many characteristics with the character of Jay Gatsby (pictured is Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio as Gatsby in the 2013 film) - he was overly generous, ostentatious and yet introverted

He owned many of America's most famous distilleries, including the Fleischmann Distillery, which he bought for $197,000 - a price which included 3,100 gallons of whiskey.  

In addition to becoming the 'King of the Bootleggers' Remus was known as a generous host.

He held many parties, including a 1923 birthday party for Imogene in which she appeared in a daring bathing suit, serenaded by a fifteen-piece orchestra.

Remus enjoyed flaunting his wealth - his mansion in Price Hill was decorated in rare art and exotic plants.

For his daughter Romola he installed a massive indoor pool at a reported cost of $125,000.

He was renowned for throwing lavish galas and events where he showered guests with expensive gifts.

He and his wife held a New Year's Eve party at their mansion in 1922.

As parting gifts, Remus presented all the men with diamond watches and gave each woman a brand new car.

But despite his overt generosity Remus was an introvert. He did not drink or smoke and during parties he would sometimes retreat to his personal library – much like Jay Gatsby.

Mr Hotchkiss said: 'F. Scott Fitzgerald met Remus by chance at a hotel in Louisville.

'The writer was fascinated with this larger-than-life personality, and based the eponymous character in 'The Great Gatsby' on Remus.

'There used to be a photo of Remus surrounded by the police chief, Capone and Fitzgerald, all in laughter. He truly was a character that transcends time.' 

Remus was also seen as charitable, donating money and presents to those in need - along with those who were perhaps not so needy.

'Remus had an untold amount of bribes to the police, lawyers and government,' Mr Hotchkiss said.

He allegedly even paid off the U.S. Attorney General of the time.

But his luck finally ran out and in 1925 he was charged with thousands of violations of the Volstead Act and was sentenced to a two-year prison term in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary.

But according to biographers he still managed to throw a lavish party on his private train coach to Georgia.

While behind bars he enjoyed his meals at the prison chaplain's residence, his cell was always decorated with flowers and he was even waited on by servants.

His cellmate was Franklin Dodge and the pair got on so well Remus even confided how he was hiding his personal assets from the government - by keeping his wife Imogene in charge of his estate.

But Dodge was an undercover FBI agent, sent to prison to investigate a corrupt warden.

Dodge, for his part, did not tell the agency but instead resigned his post and headed to Cincinnati.

There he embarked on an affair with Imogene Remus and helped to spend most of her husband's empire, leaving Remus destitute.

She sold his mansion, his distilleries and all of his possessions, leaving him just $100.

After Remus left prison Imogene filed for divorce, but on her way to the courthouse to finalise it Remus had his cab driver chase her down.

She was forced to abandon her vehicle in Eden Park and in front of a shocked crowd Remus shot and killed her.

The subsequent trial attracted national attention.

The prosecution was led by Charles Phelps Taft II, the son of former President William Howard Taft.

Despite the testimony of several witnesses, Remus was found not guilty by reason of insanity.

There were rumours of trial fraud, a theory that appeared proven when Remus threw a celebratory party after the verdict with all 12 jurors in attendance.

Remus' stay in the asylum was short as he used Taft's reasoning that he was not insane to get himself back out again.

A free Remus tried to restart his bootlegging venture, but found other bootleggers had taken control of the market in his absence and so he retired, dying in 1952 of natural causes aged 77.
