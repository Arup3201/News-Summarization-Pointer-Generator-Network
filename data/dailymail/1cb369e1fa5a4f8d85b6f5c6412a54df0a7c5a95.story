Police are searching for a man they believe killed his wife and her grandfather in what is described as ‘a horrific crime of passion’.

The body of Don William Shedd, 69, was discovered by his nine-year-old great-granddaughter at their Dalton, Georgia home. Jessica B. Neal, 27, was later discovered dead in the pool house.

Authorities would not say how the two were murdered, but have named Ms Neal’s husband, Adolph Ray ‘Sonny’ Neal, 49, as their prime suspect.

Mr Shedd's body was found on Thursday by Ms Neal's 9-year-old daughter, who was on her way to school.

The terrified girl ran to a neighbour’s house for help, and authorities later discovered the girl’s mother dead in the pool house, according to the Dalton Daily Citizen.

Authorities have not said how the two were killed but Sheriff Scott Chitwood has called the deaths 'extremely violent.'

Captain Rick Swiney from the Whitfield County Sheriff's Office said on Friday that the 49-year-old wanted in the deaths of Ms Neal and Mr Shedd.

Capt. Swiney said authorities are unsure of Sonny Neal's whereabouts but are searching woods around the neighbourhood where Neal lives and have extended the manhunt into other states.

Swiney would not clarify which states were involved in the investigation.

According to 11alive.com, Ms Neal, who was 22 years younger than her husband, was considering a return to school to become a dental assistant. 

Sources also told the station that she was contemplating getting divorced.

The violent crime has shocked the quiet neighbourhood outside of Dalton. Neighbour Eugene Cochran described Sonny Neal as an ‘average fellow.’

He added: ‘You wouldn’t think about him doing something like that,’ according to 11alive.com.

The manhunt includes local, state and federal authorities. In addition, a reward has been offered for Sonny Neal’s capture.
