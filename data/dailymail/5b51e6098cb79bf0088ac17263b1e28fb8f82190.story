Low vitamin D levels could make childbirth more painful, scientists have warned in a new study.

A team in the US discovered women were more likely to opt for an epidural to ease their pain if they were Vitamin D deficient.  

The scientists measured the vitamin D levels of 93 pregnant women prior to them delivering their babies.

All of the women had requested an epidural for the pain during labour.

The team then measured how much pain medication each woman required during labour. 

They compared the quantity of pain medication used by women with higher vitamin D levels to those of the women with lower vitamin D levels.  

The findings, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists in New Orleans, showed women with lower vitamin D levels required more pain medication than those with higher levels.

Dr Andrew Geller, an anesthesiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and senior author of the study, said: 'Women often experience lower than normal levels of vitamin D during pregnancy.

'We found that patients with low levels of vitamin D experienced an increase in pain during childbirth.'

While vitamin D deficiency has long been associated with depression and pain, this is the first study to highlight the link with pain levels during childbirth. 

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said vitamin D deficiency is common during pregnancy, particularly among high-risk groups including vegetarians, women with limited exposure to the sun and ethnic minorities.

It is largely found in fortified milk, juice, fish oils and dietary supplements. 

The authors of the study noted an estimated 41 per cent of pregnant women in the US are deficient in vitamin D, with another 41 per cent having insufficient levels. 

Dr Geller said: 'Given the research results, prevention and treatment of low vitamin D levels in pregnant women may have a significant impact on decreasing labor pain in millions of women every year. 

'This topic needs to be revisited and additional research should be conducted to determine how we can improve the labor experience for women everywhere.'
