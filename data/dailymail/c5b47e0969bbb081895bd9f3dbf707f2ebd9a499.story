Families have been spending more of their income on pleasure to try to escape the pressures of recession, an official report said yesterday.

It found that we have been spending more on package holidays, televisions, hi-tech gadgets and sports tickets and less on food and soft drinks.

The increase in the amounts devoted to leisure has come at a time when family budgets remain stressed, according to the annual Family Spending report from the Office for National Statistics.

Families are spending increasing amounts of money on gadgets inside the home as the economy improves 

The report said that last year a typical home was able to spend £517.30 a week, up £16.30 on 2012 levels. But, after allowing for inflation, this was over than £30 a week less than each household was able to spend before the recession struck, in 2006, and below spending levels of the early 2000s.

According to the ONS spending measurements, charted in an annual survey of 5,000 homes, people have been turning to entertainment to try to compensate for their stagnant incomes.

Last year an average family spent the biggest share of its income on paying for its home, and for fuel and power - £74.40 a week – as utility bills went up. The second category was transport, which took £70.40 out of a typical home’s budget.

But next came spending in the area described by the ONS as recreation and culture, at £63.90 a week, 12 per cent of the average budget. The category includes TV and audio-visual equipment; computers; books and newspapers; sports, theatre and cinema tickets; package holidays, and pets and garden furniture.

Report editor Giles Horsfield said it was ‘interesting that spending on recreation and culture has held up’ during the recession and added that a reason could be ‘desire for escapism’.

More than a third of recreational spending in a typical home went on package holidays - £22.40 a week – while sport, cinema and TV subscriptions took up £18.60, and £2.20 on pet food.

The urge to spend on items that may not be necessities was also apparent in the transport section of family spending. Transport spending went up, the ONS said, partly because people were buying more new cars. On average families devoted £8.30 a week to new vehicles.

As well as holidays, families have been splashing out on the latest new technology such as mobile phones 

‘Purchasing new cars is an area where households could moderate or defer expenditure,’ the ONS said, ‘which may lead to demand building up over time. This is sometimes referred to as pent up demand. This may have fuelled the increase in sales of new cars seen in 2013, with consumers replacing vehicles they kept hold of through the recent downturn.’

The survey also found that people spent almost as much on air fares - £5.40 a week – as on rail, tube and bus fares put together, at £5.50 a week.

Spending on food and non-alcoholic drink went downwards compared with rising interest in entertainment and the steep demands of energy, rent, bills and mortgages. The ONS said there were indications of a fall in spending on food, likely to be linked to families taking advantage of growing price competition between supermarkets.

The survey showed that the average mortgage cost £145.40 a week, and families that rent typically paid £92.10 a week for their home.

The poorest 10 per cent of homes spent just £189.80 on goods and services, well under a fifth of the £1,119.50 spending of the wealthiest tenth of households.

The wealthiest parts of the country were the South East, which over the past three years had typical household spending of £585.40 a week, and London, spending for each home on average £579.60. Lowest spending was in the North East, at £424.60 a week. In Scotland average family spending over three years was £449.00, and in Wales £438.50.

The report noted that spending reached £539.80 in 2006, ‘and started declining, just before the economic downturn’. In 2007 average household spend was £531.70 at 2013 prices, and reached bottom level at £501 in 2012.

The decline in family spending is fresh evidence that many incomes were strained before the onset of the recession in 2008. Last month a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that poverty among people who have jobs began to rise in 2004.

Some analysts believe pressure on wages and incomes began to rise in 2004 and 2005 when more than a million Eastern European workers began to arrive in Britain, many to compete for low-paid jobs.
