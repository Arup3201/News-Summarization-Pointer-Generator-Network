Meet Sammi, the Springer Spaniel who amazed vets in Simi Valley, California with his overwhelming desire to walk again after being left quadriplegic by a nervous system defect. 

These heartwarming videos shows Sammi’s inspirational journey to recovery and the moment his mom, Janie, first saw him walk again.

Janie drops her handbag and sinks to the floor, her hands over her mouth before smothering Sammi with kisses and hugs, crying tears of delight. All she can say is ‘oh my god, look at you!

Touching: Sammi's mom Janie was delighted to see him walking again after his long, painful stint in rehab

Shock: Sammi's mom Janie can't believe her eyes

Amazed: She drops to the floor covering her face

Reunion: She smothers Sammi with hugs and kisses

She the rehab staff who and thanks them for working tirelessly to bring Sammi back to health.

In March 2008 eight-year-old Sammi went from active pup to paralysed when a bone started growing inside his spinal column,  putting pressure on his spinal cord.

Surgeons battled to remove the rogue bone but were unsuccessful, meaning the start of intensive, painful rehabilitation for Sammi.

Water: Sammi's muscle strengthening treatment included hydrotherapy and physiotherapy

He began a course of daily muscle strengthening exercises, hydrotherapy and physiotherapy, much like that used in human rehabilitation.

At the start Sammi’s legs were so stiff that vets struggled to make them simulate a walking motion, supported in a hoist, as he squealed in pain.

Lengthy: Sammi had to have treatment ever day to gradually learn how to walk again

Success: Today Sammi is back to his old self, walking, running and playing with his family at their California home

It was a slow process but eventually Sammi reached a milestone when he managed to sit up by himself after three long months of therapy.

From there he developed enough muscle in his legs to stand while aided, and kept working hard until he could do it by himself. ‘Unbelievable,’ one member of staff can be heard saying on the video. ‘That dog is a miracle’.

Today he is finally back to his old self – running, jumping, and playing with his family at their California home.
