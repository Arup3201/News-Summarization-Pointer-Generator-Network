Nicole Dufault, 34, is charged with the sexual of three male students and now prosecutors say they have video proof

A New Jersey high school teacher accused of sexually assaulting three 15-year-old boys 
in her car and at the school where she taught was even captured on video performing oral sex on one victim.

In investigating the allegations against mother-of-two Nicole Dufault, 34, authorities discovered the video and a piece of clothing she was wearing while searching her apartment.

Dufault is charged with several counts of aggravated sexual
 assault and endangering the welfare of a child, NJ.com reported.

At least one other victim is supposedly present in the video.

Essex County Assistant Prosecutor Gina Iosim unveiled new details in the case Friday as the court heard a motion to reduce Dufault's $500,000 bail on the grounds she had no criminal record and longstanding community ties.

Her attorneys argued she had not even received a traffic ticket.

She is awaiting trial in Essex County jail.

The motion was denied by Superior Court Judge Michael R. Ravin.

He said the bail was reasonable given both the severity and number of charges, and added that the video meant the likelihood of conviction was very high.

Iosim also argued that Dufault had seen two prior complaints lodged against her at Columbia High School for 'lack of professionalism and her conduct.'

She was accused of having 'inappropriate sexual conversations in the classroom,' in one complaint.

She's also accused of lying about her work experience on her resume, listing one former employer where she never actually worked.

Dufault's attorney, Timothy Smith, has not said the video and said after the hearing he could not comment without seeing the new evidence.

He did say 'sometimes a video...doesn't tell the entire story

'If the video depicts certain things happening...that doesn't mean my client's not innocent,' he told NJ.com. 'For example, she could be the victim. People are victimized by juveniles all the time.'

Prosecutors
 in Essex County say that Dufault, who taught language arts at Columbia 
High School for nine years, assaulted the boys during the regular 
academic year and summer school between 2013-2014.

The
 encounters allegedly took place in the teacher's car and the school's 
campus in Maplewood, New Jersey, and included oral sex and intercourse, 
authorities charge.

She faces 12 separate charges. Each alleged victim was 15 at the time of the encounters.

Dufault's two minor children have been removed from her custody.

She only spoke briefly during the hearing, saying she was 'well' when asked by Ravin at the opening.

Dufault has been a language arts teacher for nine years at Columbia High School (pictured) in Maplewood, New Jersey. Prosecutors say some of the assaults happened in her car and on school property and that they now have eyewitnesses to testify

Beyond the videotape, the state evidence reportedly includes statements from each of the five victims about their encounters with Dufault and witnesses that also 'witnessed her in sexual acts with others.'

Smith also tried to argue that Dufault should be released from the county jail as she has a 'horrific medical condition' of a shunt in her brain because of accumulated spinal fluid that can not be properly treated while incarcerated.

However Ravin did not see anything in the evidence leading him to believe the jail could not address her medical needs.

'I don't understand how someone can't pick up the clues for something like that or how any one of those kids would not have said something before now,' parent Jennifer Berkeley told WABC.  'It's really surprising to me.'

'They do background checks on the teachers, so I don’t understand,' another Columbia HS parent told CBS New York.

Dufault was arrested at her home on Wedneday. One neighbor, who's known the teacher for six years, was shocked to hear about the allegations.

'Seemed like a, you know, just an average mom going to work,' Maureen Messina told CBS New York.

'Not only did she destroy her life and her children, but the boys who are involved as well,' the neighbor added.

Dufault is being held at the Essex County Jail in lieu of $500,000 bail.
