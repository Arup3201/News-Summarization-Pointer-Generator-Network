Catwoman meet your less stealthy match.

Police are on the prowl for a man dressed as a leopard who harassed employees at a Shell gas station in Indianapolis.

Local cops said the man in the feline costume told a gas station clerk he was hungry and threatened to hurt him.

‘Every time, they think that it's funny,’ Sylvano Houessou, the manager of the gas station store, told Fox59. ‘They come to the store just to mess with you, fight with you, trying to do stuff. They just don't care about nobody, you know?’

The leopard man struck twice in three nights at the Shell station.

Surveillance video caught him and his two friends walking in on a recent Sunday morning.

The video shows the costumed prankster entering the store, rubbing his belly while waiting behind a customer and then tossing a green stuffed animal at a cashier. The leopard man then tackles a rack of junk food before running out of the store.

He was followed by a gas station employee carrying a big stick.

Houessou and his employees told Fox59 that the costumed man and his friends are no longer allowed in the store.

They will also keep their doors locked during late hours, they said.
