On the run: Somali-born jihadist Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed may have been in possession of his passport when he cut off his tag

Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed may have been in possession of his passport when he gave authorities the slip by cutting off his ankle tag with a sharp instrument.

The details of how easily he got away heaped fresh pressure on the Home Office and police yesterday.

Theresa May was forced to admit inadvertently misleading Parliament when she said on Monday police had seized the fanatic’s travel document. In fact, officers were never able to find one.

The Home Office said Mohamed’s passport had been cancelled – but refused to say if this happened before or after he fled.

Sources revealed how the terror suspect removed the ankle tag, fitted as a condition of his terrorism prevention order (T-Pim), after entering the An-Noor mosque in West London last Friday.

He had arrived at 10am and left at 3.15pm.

The tag sent a ‘tamper-alert’ to its maker, private security firm G4S, which then rang Mohamed to check where he was.

It was only when he did not respond to the call that police and the Home Office were alerted.

But by the time officers arrived he had disappeared.

Security officials launched a major manhunt for the jihadist, but fear he may already have fled to Somalia.

On Monday, Mrs May told MPs  that police had Mohamed’s British passport.

But yesterday she said Mohamed was not in possession of his British passport when he returned to the UK after being arrested overseas, so ‘there was no passport for the police to seize’.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons  Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘When there are only eight people on T-Pims they [the Home Office] ought to know every detail about them.’

A Whitehall official dismissed suggestions Mohamed had fled using the travel document, saying: ‘As far as we know he didn’t have a passport.’
