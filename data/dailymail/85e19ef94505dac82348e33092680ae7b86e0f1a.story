Betty Draper wannabees can head to Surrey to join the UK's top housewife hotspot

In Desperate Housewives, all kinds of drama and intrigue unfold in the fictional US town of Fairview.

Now, it seems, Britain has its own equivalent... Tandridge in East Surrey.

This leafy corner of the commuter belt has been declared the housewife capital of Britain.

A study found 64 per cent of women in the area, described by residents as full of ‘body-conscious yummy mummies’, were housewives who do not work.

By contrast, only around 30 per cent of married mothers nationwide are in a similar position, Office for National Statistics figures suggest.

Tandridge – home to celebrities including  Dame Judi Dench and businessman Mohamed Al Fayed – is a largely affluent area.

It contains part of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, as well as part of the Weald. Its biggest towns – Caterham, birthplace of actor Bill Nighy, and Oxted  – are within easy reach of London and over half its working population commute to the capital, 22 miles away.

Almost half of households – 48 per cent – have two cars or more.

Clare Francis-Bird, 47, a mother of 
two from Tandridge, yesterday suggested the percentage of stay-at-home 
women could be even higher.

She said: ‘At the school my children go to I would say that the figure is more like 80 per cent of housewives.’

Describing the typical Tandridge 
‘yummy mummy’, the former  nursery teacher added: ‘A newish  4x4 is a 
must, typically very  body-conscious, maybe a size six or an eight.

Leafy Surrey is a housewife haven, with two thirds of women living there not needing to work

‘They are very aware of keeping fit 
and also have the time to do it. Many around here are yummy mummies. If 
I’m really honest I think people have got the money for the wife not to 
work.’

The average house price in  Tandridge 
is £535,000 and just  20 per cent of residents rent, compared with a 
national average of  32 per cent.

Peter Gottelier, of East Surrey-based Rayner’s Estate Agents, said: ‘There are certainly some very affluent areas in Tandridge.

‘For example, in Oxted you will struggle to pick up a property for anything less than a million pounds.

‘Because there is an abundance of very
large schools in the area, naturally that attracts a lot of families to
live here.’  The study, launched by film subscription service LoveFilm 
and based on ONS figures, found that the top ten locations for 
stay-at-home wives and mothers were almost all around the capital, in 
Surrey, Kent and Greater London.

But Gloucestershire’s Forest of Dean 
came second, ahead of Merton –  the Greater London area which includes 
Wimbledon – in third.

Pendle, in Lancashire, was the first 
northern district to feature in the list, in 17th place – one of just 
two northern entries in the top 25.

Helen Cowley, of LoveFilm, said: ‘Our 
study shows that there are significantly more housewives in the South 
with just a couple of cities in the top 25 representing the north of the
UK.’

Nationwide 70.9 per cent of  married 
or co-habiting British women with dependent children were working in 
2011, according to ONS figures.

Tandridge is just 22 miles from London, it contains part of the North Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, part of the Weald and the towns of Warlingham, Caterham, Oxted, Godstone and Lingfield.

The area has several woodlands and some open heathland. Elevations range from 267m at Botley Hill, North Downs to 42m above sea level near Edenbridge.

The average house price is £363,586

Notable residents include Katie Price, Mohamed Al-Fayed, Dame Judie Dench and Shayne Ward.
