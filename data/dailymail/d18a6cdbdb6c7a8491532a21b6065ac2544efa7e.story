Transformed: Mayra Rosales, who has lost over 800lbs, has told how she is fighting for custody of her sister's three surviving children

The woman dubbed the 'half-ton killer', after falsely confessing to killing her two-year-old nephew, is fighting for custody of her jailed sister's three surviving children after shedding an incredible 800lbs.

Marya Rosales, 33, who once weighed around 1,100lbs, told police she accidentally killed her sister Jaime's son Eliseo by rolling on top of him while babysitting five years ago.

But investigators found she was too heavy to have committed the crime and at her 2008 murder trial in Texas they proved she was actually covering for her sister who had who beat her son to death with a hairbrush.

Rosales, who was barely able to move and had to be cut out of her home and carried to a removal van by ten men, admitted her sister had begged her to cover for her.

Although she knew it was wrong, she said she felt she had already 'given up on life' and effectively had nothing to lose by pleading guilty to the crime, ABC reports.

After she was cleared of the killing, her sister Jaime Rosales went on the run but was eventually persuaded to return to Texas where she pleaded guilty to causing injury to a child and was sentenced to 15 years in jail.

In a documentary special 'Half-Ton Killer: Transformed', to be aired on TLC tomorrow night, Rosales tells how she is now hoping to be granted custody of Jaime's three other children.

She said the children, currently living with their grandmother, call her 'mom' and were the imspiration behind her incredible weight loss.

She said: 'They were first to know when I was able to stand up for the first time, and then when they saw me walking, they saw me walk in the door, they were very excited. They are my motivation.'

Rosales, who has shed around four fifths of her body weight also reveals why she stuck to the story that she had killed Eliseo, even after being charged with murder.

She said: 'I tried to protect my sister, and I was already dying so I didn't see ... like I was doing [something] wrong.

Too fat to kill: Rosales, pictured weighing around 1,100lbs, claimed she had accidentally killed her nephew, but investigators found she would have been incapable of the crime

'I was already giving up in life, and the way I saw it, when they began saying I was going to get capital murder charges, I really saw it like they were doing me a favor.'

'I knew I was not doing right, but I was willing to give up my life for her.'

Rosales was found innocent after doctors revealed Eliseo could only have died from a blow to the head - which could not have been struck by Rosales because she was too big to lift her arm.

In 2008, shortly before Eliseo was murdered, Mayra and her husband Bernie had moved in with her sister Jaime in Sullivan City, Texas.

Jaime had agreed to be a full-time carer when Mayra became so large she struggled to walk.

However despite the fact that Mayra was almost entirely bed-ridden, Jaime would often go out, leaving Mayra in charge of her four children.

'I was more of a mother than Jaime,' Mayra has previously said. In March 2008, Mayra witnessed her sister hit Eliseo Jr.

‘Jaime was giving my nephew breakfast and he didn’t want to eat,’ Mayra said. ‘I told her if he was crying he wasn’t going to eat, but she got mad, got a brush and hit him on his arms, legs and head which left a bump.'

Later that day, Eliseo Jr began suffering breathing problems and Mayra called an ambulance.

Jaime
phoned her sister from the hospital, sobbing that police would not let 
her see her son unless she told them who had hurt him.

Jaime
begged Mayra to tell the authorities she was responsible for the 
injuries. In a move she would come to bitterly regret, Mayra accepted.

Rosales said she did so to help her sister so that she would not lose her other children.

‘I
told the investigators that I rolled over to the edge of my bed to 
where Junior was and my hand slipped and I fell on him with my hand. I 
fell. I was the one to blame. But only by accident,' she explained.

When her two-year-old nephew later died, Mayra Rosales was arrested and charged with capital murder.

Manpower: It took ten men to remove Mayra in a removal truck from her sister's home in 2008

At
her trial, the court heard that the fatal injuries sustained by the boy
were consistent with a blow to the head and could not have been caused 
by someone falling on him.

'It
would have required her to have to swing her arm to strike the child on
the head but she could never move her arm in that manner,’ said Mayra’s
lawyer Sergio Valdez. ‘We knew that her size was her best defence 
because she couldn’t move her arm.'

Despite the physical impossibility of 
Mayra committing such a crime, the authorities had to conduct a full 
trial, with Mayra as chief suspect.

Months
went by before a courtroom was found that was large enough to 
accommodate Mayra, and doors and walls had to be removed to fit her in.

The
stress of the case caused Mayra's health to deteriorate to the point 
that she had to be admitted to a hospital for the super-obese.

When a regular ambulance was too small to transport her, a removal truck had to be used.

‘I began retaining more water in my legs and they got so hard,’ she said.

‘The skin is so stretched out that it hurts. It feels like my legs are going to pop like a balloon.

'Sometimes the sores open up and water oozes out. I wondered if we should amputate.'

She added: 'Sometimes I got mad. I tried not to show it that much because I didn’t want anyone feeling bad for me.

'It was like I was in prison, with chains holding me there so I couldn’t move.’

Rosales admits she despised the nickname and told how aftter she had cleared her name she underwent surgery six times to remove tumors and excess skin.

She had to lose 600 pounds before she was safely able to undergo gastric bypass surgery.

She added:  'I think it's a miracle of God that I'm healthy.

'I'm alive, and I'm not diabetic. I do not have cholesterol [problems]. I don't have high blood pressure, so I'm healthy.'
