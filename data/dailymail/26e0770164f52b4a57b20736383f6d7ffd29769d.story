Accused: Roland Wright, 82, allegedly watched while another teacher molested a boy in his dorm room, a court hears

The former headmaster of Nick Clegg's old prep school stood watching while another teacher molested a young boy in his dorm, a court heard today.

Roland Wright, now 82, subjected a dozen boys - some under the age of 14 - to a catalogue of abuse between 1959 and 1970, the jury was told.

The offences are said to have happened at the exclusive Â£20,000-a-year Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire, which was attended by the deputy prime minister, although he was not a pupil at the time of the abuse.

Aylesbury Crown Court heard today how a former pupil woke one night to find he was being fondled by sports teacher Hugh Henry while 'suave' Wright looked on.

Jurors have been told how Wright - also known by his middle name Peter - may have 'afforded' Mr Henry opportunities to 'indulge his interests' in young boys at Caldicott.

At the time Wright was a sports and French teacher at the school but he became headmaster in 1968 and held the position until 1993.

The witness, who was a full-time boarder at the school between 1960 to 1963 but cannot be named, said: 'I was in the dorm room where I and 12 other students slept.

'It happened very late about 11pm or 11.30pm. Lights out was between 8pm and 8:30pm.

'I was asleep with the other boys. The first thing I was aware of, I was being sexually assaulted by Hugh Henry.

'He wasn't alone in the room, Peter Wright was there too. Peter Wright was the other male teacher responsible for the sports activities with the school.

'He was very suave, very well dressed, very articulate and likeable. He had some considerable pride in the success he was able to bring through the school's sporting achievements through his coaching skills.

'He drove a sport car, I believe it was an E Type Jaguar.

'I can't be sure what he was doing that night, but I know he was in there because he was speaking to Hugh Henry. This occurred about two months after my commencement at the school.

Abuse claims: Roland Wright, 82, is accused of abusing a dozen boys between 1959 and 1970. He denies wrong-doing

'I formed the very strong impression that both men had been drinking - there was a very strong smell of whiskey from Hugh Henry, who was a smoker so there was a strong smell of cigarette smoke.'

The witness told the court he turned in his bed, which forced Mr Henry to stop, and heard the other boys in the dorm waking up.

He said he had been abused on numerous occasions by Mr Henry, who tutored him in his house on school grounds - but was never molested by Wright.

But the witness did say there was a 'collusion' between the two teachers.

John Price QC, prosecuting, read a statement from the witness's mother, who had contacted the school at the time raising concerns about Mr Henry's tuition taking place in his home.

Former school: Wright was a master then a headmaster at Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire

Former school: Nick Clegg went to Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Royal, Buckinghamshire. He was not there at the time the incidents are alleged to have taken place

The mother said in her statement: 'I 
asked my son how are the extra lessons. He said 'alright, but whenever I
get anything wrong, Mr Henry tackled me on to the bed.

'I was surprised and shocked. He informed me he was being tutored in Mr Henry's bedroom.

'I
contacted the school and relayed my concerns it was taking place in Mr 
Henry's bedroom and wasn't happy with the rugby tackling and physical 
contact. The master laughed at me and said "Oh, you're not casting 
aspersions on Mr Henry are you?".'

A short while after, Mr Henry was escorted from the school premises by police after being found in bed with a pupil.

Wright,
of Farnham Royal, was a French and sports teacher, coached the first 
rugby XV and later took the post of headteacher at the top school.

The
court heard yesterday how Wright fondled young boys in his study 
bedroom near to the dorms, and in a cottage close to the school where he
still resides.

Wright denies 15 counts of indecent assault - including two counts of indecency with a child.

The former headteacher, who uses a hearing aid to listen to proceedings, sat intently while the evidence was being given today.

The trial, expected to last eight weeks, continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
