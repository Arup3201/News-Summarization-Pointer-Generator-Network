If you've always dreamed of seeing the world's southernmost continent but can't bear the cold, then perhaps these day trips are for you.

An airline is offering 12-hour tours over the expanses of Antarctica so passengers can enjoy the view, but there will be no venturing out in the snow because the planes don't land.

For a truly unique extravagant experience, the company Antarctica Sightseeing Flights even offers a special New Year's Eve Party flight, where guests will be treated to a live jazz band and arguably the 'coolest' party experience in the world.  

Antartica Sightseeing Flights offer once in a lifetime day trips to see the southernmost continent from the sky

Currently, the tour company offers flights from five major Australian cities, including Sydney and Brisbane

Operating out of Australia on a private Qantas 747 plane, the unusual tour flies from five Australian cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane.

But you'll need deep pockets. Prices start from AUS$1,000 (£535), but that is for an aisle seat. For a spot next to the window you'll be parting with $1,999 (£1,069).

And if you want to travel Ice Class, with Champagne and lie-flat beds it will set you back $7,999 (£4,280). New Year's Eve Party flights are priced on application.

Each of the flights takes anywhere between 12 to 13 hours with planes flying above the continent for about four of those hours - without ever touching the ground.

Flights go as low as 10,000 feet, offering spectacular views of major landmarks, such as Ninnis Glacier and Mertz Glacier, as well as the Transantarctic Mountains and the Ross Sea.

Each of the flights takes between 12 to 13 hours, with about 4 hours spent over top of Antarctica

Passengers will be able to view the Mertz Glacier (pictured) as well as the Ninnis Glacier from 10,000 feet

The stunning Transantarctic Mountains will also be visible from the plane, like these frozen rapids 

Depending on weather conditions, the pilots have several different routes that they can take to ensure the best visibility. 

The aircraft will also fly 'figure 8's' over these specific points of interest so that they can be viewed on both sides of the aircraft. 

Unfortunately, however, the low altitude is still not close enough to see any wildlife up close.

Experts on each flight will be present to answer all of your questions, as well as to give talks on the environment and the history of the area.

Video screenings and live radio link ups with sciences on the research bases will also take place.

Experts are on board the flight the entire time to share stories, answer questions and explain video clips

Still, the incredible views will last for over four hours as the pilots fly 'figure 8s.' Pictured: the Ross Sea

During the 12 hour flight, passengers will experience the full Qantas flight service, including two meals, in-flight snacks and complimentary bar service. 

During all flights, cabins are separated into seven classes, from Economy Class to Ice Class (first class). 

Flights are classified as domestic, meaning that no passport is required. However, passengers must bring photo ID.

Prices begin at AUD$1,199 (£647) per person and the next flight departs from Brisbane on January 18.
