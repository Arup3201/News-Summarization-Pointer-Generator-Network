La Liga clubs are edging towards a deal that would sell their TV rights collectively in a bid to end the financial dominance of Real Madrid and Barcelona.

At present, Spanish clubs sell their rights individually. But this has lead to a complete lack of competition with Barcelona and Real Madrid each receiving around £120million a season.

Their nearest rivals, Atletico Madrid, receive less than half that amount. But, as revealed today in The Times, that financial dominance is set to end as the clubs look to copy the Premier League and sells their right together.

President: Barcelona's Josep Maria Bartomeu has been a main advocate of a collective TV rights deal

The deal, which would start from the beginning of the 2016-17 season, would help the image of Spain's league, which has been won by Barcelona or Real Madrid in 15 of the last 20 seasons. 

Barcelona's president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, said: 'Barcelona and Madrid sell individually and we negotiate with a lot of success.

'That helps us to have as many of the best players in the world as possible. But we know the problem: the Premier League is very competitive. 

'You never know who will win. In Spain, between 2004 and 2014 it has been just Barcelona and Madrid, mainly Barcelona.

Poached: With so much more money, Barcelona and Real Madrid have been able to poach opposition palyers

Initially it seems a counter-intuitive move for Spain's big two, but an increasingly competitive league will eventually mean more money for them. And, in the mean time, they will not lose any money.

Bartomeu said: 'We are leading the attempt to find a consensus. It has been our objective for a long time to convince all the clubs in La Liga to sell the rights as a competition. 

'Not all of them have been helpful. We will make the same, but the (revenue) increase will go to the other clubs.'

Achievement: Considering the financial disparity, Atletico Madrid's title victory deserves enormous credit
