Watches by Baume et Mercier (example pictured) and Givenchy, which can be worth as much as £3,000, are among items accepted by diplomats abroad then sold by the Foreign Office

Luxury watches and jewellery given as gifts to ambassadors and their staff are being auctioned off for a fraction of their original value.

Watches by Baume et Mercier and Givenchy, which can be worth as much as £3,000, are among items accepted by diplomats abroad then sold by the Foreign Office.

The Mail on Sunday has obtained a list of auctioned gifts, which includes bracelets, a gold coin, Mont Blanc pens, prayer beads, cufflinks, candle sticks, a blanket, a tie, earrings and even a 3G mobile device.

In two years the Government has taken
 in £10,401.66 at Birmingham auction house Fellows. The buyers are not 
aware they are bidding on diplomatic gifts and any inscriptions are 
removed.

Watches sold by the FCO fetched anywhere between £800 and just £18. A watch and bracelet set sold for just £20.

Geoff
 Whitefield, of Fellows, said: ‘A watch that might be worth £2,000 or 
£3,000 could sell for less than a third of that at open market.

‘It’s a bit like buying a brand new car – the minute you drive it off the forecourt you’re taking first hit depreciation.’

Though
 the FCO refused to say which countries’ presents it had sold, a Freedom
 of Information request revealed it has received tens of thousands of 
pounds’ worth of gifts from regimes such as Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and 
Burma in the past three years.

The FCO said the watches were worn for a short time to avoid causing offence and then sent back to the UK. If staff want to keep gifts worth more than £140 they must pay the difference themselves.

Last night, Labour MP Andy Slaughter said: ‘This seems terribly two-faced that they’re prepared to accept lavish gifts from disreputable regimes but then flog them off quietly.’

Mont Blanc pens were included in the list of items accepted by diplomats abroad then sold by the Foreign Office

The list also includes cufflinks, candle sticks, a blanket, a tie, earrings and even a 3G mobile device
