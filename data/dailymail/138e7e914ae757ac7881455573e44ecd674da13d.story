An ultrasound sensor kit could enable people with visual impairments to ride a bicycle independently.

The UltraBike unit has sensors to give the rider constant directional feedback of obstacles ahead and at each side, via vibrating buttons beneath each thumb.

The device, which is detachable and can be fitted onto the handlebars of any bike, was designed by electronics engineer and entrepreneur Paul Clark.

It uses the same obstacle detection capability in the award winning UltraCane, an electronic mobility aid that is used by people with sight loss all over the world.

The UltraCane mimics the echolocation abilities of bats and was featured on the BBC documentary series Miracles of Nature, fronted by Richard Hammond in 2012.

The programme makers approached Dr Clark’s company Comms Design, to adapt the UltraCane technology for use on a bicycle that could be tested with a blind rider.

Dan Smith, who had been a keen cyclist before losing his sight, was shown on the programme steering a straight course through a heavily wooded cycle path using the first UltraBike.

Since the programme, Sound Foresight Technology has made the kits more widely available, to give groups of visually impaired riders the opportunity to try an UltraBike, most notably at a world first event run by Life Cycle UK in Bristol, on a specially constructed cycle track.

Dr Clark commented: 'The UltraBike is not suitable for visually impaired road cyclists because road drivers assume a cyclist can see, so this is clearly too hazardous. 

'It is designed for use in a supervised and controlled environment and has great potential for use in sport and velodrome settings in particular. We are now looking at specific enhancements to the technology for this purpose.'

Sound Foresight Technology is currently working with sports organisations around the country to run UltraBike events.

The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) and the organisers of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow have both already shown an interest.

Anyone else can go and see the device for themselves at London’s Science Museum, where it is part of a new exhibition highlighting innovative engineering that transforms lives.

The display an interview with Dr Clark in which he explains how he approached the challenges of turning a ground breaking ‘what if’ idea into an engineering reality.
