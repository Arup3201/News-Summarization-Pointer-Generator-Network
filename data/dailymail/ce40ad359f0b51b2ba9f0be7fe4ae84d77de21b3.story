Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes, who was mugged outside his home last month, said receiving £330,000 from well-wishers was 'like a fairy story' as he spoke at a glitzy ball in his honour.

The celebration was organised by Katie Cutler, the 21-year-old beautician who started the fundraising campaign which led to 25,000 people donating worldwide. 

The 4ft 6in visually-impaired pensioner, 67, said he still had no firm plans on how to spend the money but has previously hinted at buying a house near his new friend Katie.

'Fairy story': Disabled pensioner Alan Barnes, pictured with Katie Cutler, who organised the appeal, thanked people who donated as he spoke at a celebration thrown in his honour

Mr Barnes broke his collar bone after the attack outside his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, last month. 

The pensioner was left too scared to return home, but Katie's appeal has left him with enough money to start fresh.

At the ball in the Assembly Rooms in Newcastle, Mr Barnes said: 'It is just absolutely like a fairy story. You might read about it in a book, but it has come true. It is hard to find the words really, it was just a total, total surprise.' 

Mr Barnes, who also plans to undertake charity work, spoke of his recovery. He said: 'I'm getting there. I can do small things like clean my teeth and get a bath now, eat biscuits and sweets with that hand.

'I haven't attempted to open doors with that hand, I want my fracture to heal before that.'

He spoke modestly of his painful break, calling it an 'inconvenience', adding: 'I didn't think you got people fundraising for that.'

Katie Cutler, the 21-year-old beautician who started the fundraising campaign which led to 25,000 people donating worldwide, handed Mr Barnes the huge sum of money this evening

Katie, who handed over the official cheque this evening, said: 'It gives you a warm feeling inside when you help people.' 

Around 150 people bought tickets for the event, with many more special guests invited along. 

When she set up the fund for Mr Barnes her aim was to raise £500 to pay for new curtains and carpets if he moved house.

The appeal quickly spiraled as more and more people donated, with Mr Barnes eventually calling on pledges to stop when the total passed £300,000. 

'It doesn't feel real,' she said. 'It has been very overwhelming. Once it dies down and things get back to normality, that's when it will sink in.' 

The fund was originally set up to raise £500 for the pensioner, but ended up with a total of more than £300,000

Mr Barnes - who was born with sight and growth problems after his mother contracted German Measles during pregnancy and now stands at just over four feet tall - vowed earlier this week not to spend the money on 'flashy holidays'. 

Richard Gatiss has been charged over the incident

He said: 'I have really enjoyed today and I now know where I am going to live. I'm going to get a house in Greenside near to Katie.

'If we're going to be doing things together all the time then it seems sensible to not be living too far away.

He added: 'I've decided that's where I want to go and I would like that to happen. I'm not sure how easy that will be but I'm sure we can think of something.

'My life is like three chapters, I've had the attempted robbery and mugging, then Katie came on the scene and now we get to do exciting things together.'

Katie said: 'It would be lovely if Alan moved near me. There are some great houses with nice gardens that he can use his gardening skills in.

'He can also come over to mine for BBQs and stuff in the summer.'

Richard Gatiss, 25, appeared at Gateshead Magistrates' Court this week charged with assault with intent to rob.

The case has been transferred to Newcastle Crown Court where Gatiss is set to appear on February 24.
