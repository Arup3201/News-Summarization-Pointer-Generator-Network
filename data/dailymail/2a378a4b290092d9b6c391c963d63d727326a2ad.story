UKIP leader Nigel Farage enjoyed dinner with media boss Rupert Murdoch this week, in a fresh sign of the anti-EU’s emergence as a significant political force.

The UK Independence Party is riding high after coming second in the Eastleigh by-election, pushing the Tories into a humiliating third place.

News that Mr Murdoch has hosted Mr Farage for dinner – thought to be the first of its kind – will be seen as a fresh blow for David Cameron’s Conservatives, who had previously relied on the support of the Murdoch empire.

The two men dined at Mr Murdoch’s London flat on Tuesday night. They discussed the possibility of a UKIP pact with the Tories, but only if Mr Cameron was ousted as leader.

UKIP is growing increasingly confident of winning the elections to the European Parliament next year, and Mr Farage told Mr Murdoch he could win half of all the seats up for grabs, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Last night Mr Murdoch claimed Mr Farage was ‘reflecting opinion’ and suggested new leaders are ‘emerging on distant horizon’.

In a new opinion poll, carried out by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft, 12 per cent of people said theyb would vote for UKIP in a general election, compared to nine per cent for the Lib Dems.

While UKIP has traditionally been seen as a threat mainly to the Tories, appealing to party traditionalists on issues like Europe and immigration.

Mr Farage's success has spooked the Tories, but Lib Dem president Tim Farron has warned the Conservatives not to trumpet policies which appeal to 'the man in the pub'

But a separate survey carried out in the wake of the Eastleigh by-election suggested that much of the UKIP support came from voters from all the major parties, keen to deliver a stinging rebuke to the Westminster elite.

It revealed that 22 per cent of 2010 voting Tories switched to UKIP, along with 19 per cent of Lib Dems.

Another poll this week suggested that 38 per cent of people would now ‘consider’ voting for UKIP.

Mr Murdoch took to Twitter last night with political observations about his European visits this week - drawing parallels between the UK and Italy.

‘Politics both places very fluid, economies going nowhere. New leaders emerging on distant horizon,’ he wrote in one post.

‘Stagnant Europe wracked by discontent and resentment of EU. Glad we contributed to UK resisting the Euro over many years,

‘Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, few excellent, frustrated ministers. Farage reflecting opinion.’

Meanwhile, Lib Dem President Tim Farron has warned the Tories against trying to woo UKIP supporters with populist policies.

Mr Farron told The House magazine: ‘What David Cameron has not understood, what William Hague got so wrong, is that saying things that the man in the pub tends to chime with doesn’t win you an election.

‘Because those people when they’ve sobered up realise it sounds ridiculous. The other thing is UKIP prove that their vote is not just about Europe at all.

‘It’s a general discontented, broadly right wing but not exclusively, protest vote. So Cameron is fighting the wrong issues.’
