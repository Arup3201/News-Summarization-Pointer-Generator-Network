Hunched in their snow burrows, Britain's mountain hares brave some of the harshest conditions our island can throw at them.

And for the past three years, photographer Andy Howard has shared the freezing temperatures, blizzards and snow storms with them, often lying in the snow for hours to capture incredible images of the typically timid animals.

The 43-year-old, who also acts as a mountain guide, says the hares are one of Britain's truly native creatures, having been here since the last ice age.

'I believe to truly understand a species you have to spend as much time as possible with them and in their environment,' he said. 'This day in particular, a few weeks ago, was the hardest I've experienced to date.

'It was persistent blizzards for most of the day and at times I was wading up to my chest through snow drifts.

'Mountain hares have to endure some of the harshest conditions found in the UK. I try to photograph the mountain hares at least once a fortnight throughout the year, this way I can capture their lives in all types of weather conditions they have to endure, even the severest winter storms.'

Andy has one particular hare that he has known for the past three years which is more than happy to have his picture taken.

'It's not unusual for me to spend four or five hours with my favourite hare. In fact I find if I talk to him he relaxes more and  at times he has even fallen asleep in front of me. No wild animal would do this if it wasn't totally relaxed in your presence'

As part of Andy's ongoing photographic project with the Mountain Hares of the Cairngorms he paid repeat visits to the same mountain hare over a 23 day period.

In these series of images you can see the hare's coat (pelage) morphing from its brown summer colour to its thick white winter coat. As it happens, this occurred just in the nick of time as the first heavy snow fall of the winter came a few days later.

Mountain hares are indigenous to Britain having survived from the last ice age.

They are now rarely found in the UK below 500m.

They are also spread across Europe, from Scandinavia to Siberia.

Smaller than the more common European hare, the species adapted to live in polar and mountainous habitats.

During the winter months, their fur changes from brown to white to help camouflage among the snow and avoid predators such as eagles and foxes.

The hares are also hunted for sport as small game and have been subject to culling because they allegedly carried a tick borne virus which can kill grouse chicks.

Exact numbers of mountain hares in Scotland are unknown by research by the British Trust for Ornithology found local populations had fallen by 43 per cent since 1995.

Andy added: 'In winter they are almost completely white and through the spring they moult, become a mottled brown and white colour and in summer they are brown a grey twinge, the grey colour can look like a shade of blue, in fact in the Highlands they are often referred to as blue hares.

'Mountain hares are one of only a few truly native species of mammals found in the UK.

'They have survived from the last ice age. They live in the high mountains of Scotland and prosper on well managed grouse moors, which in turn brings them into conflict with the grouse shooting fraternity as it's believed they pass on blood sucking ticks on to young grouse. 

'Mountain hares spend all year exposed to all elements and in winter move to the more sheltered leeward sides of the mountains.

'Unlike rabbits, hares don't burrow but live in shallow scrapes called forms. In the winter months hares are often completely covered in snow with just their heads visible above the snow, the snow acts as insulation against the bitter winds which can reach as low as minus forty with the wind chill.'

Andy spends most of his time photographing and guiding other wildlife photographers in the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland.

He added: 'Mountain hare photography takes a lot of patience as hares will often sit for hours without moving, it can also take up to two hours to get close enough to take a picture due to their timid nature.

'After all their Latin name is Lepus timidus.

'Good field craft and a solid understanding of their behaviour is essential to be a successful hare photographer. Also as important is layers of thermals and down jackets to stay dry and warm.'
