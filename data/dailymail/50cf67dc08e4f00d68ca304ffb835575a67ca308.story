A state of emergency was declared in Sardinia yesterday after a cyclone left at least 18 people dead and thousands homeless.

Streets vanished under floodwater and bridges collapsed as rivers burst their banks when the equivalent of six months of rain, almost 20in, fell on the island in less than 24 hours.

Gianni Giovannelli, the mayor of the north-eastern town of Olbia, where 13 of the victims died, described Cyclone Cleopatra as ‘an apocalyptic storm’.

In the town of Arzachena nearby, four 
members of the same family, including a 16-year-old girl, were drowned 
when their basement flat was submerged in a flood.

Other children were among the dead as torrential rain lashed the island.

'State of emergency': A truck and a bus are stranded by flood waters in a tunnel near Olbia, Sardinia. Cyclone Cleopatra hit the island on Monday night, killing 18 people

Flood: A rescue worker wades down a flooded street in San Gavino Monreale, Sardinia - where 450mm of rain fell overnight

Clear-up: Rescuers work in the small town of Uras next to a submerged car. Sardinia's regional government has put aside 5 million euros for the clean up

Affects: This picture, issued by the Italian Police, shows a wrecked police car recovered from a crack in a bridge that was caused by torrential rains, in Dorgali, Sardinia

Aftermath: People work to shift floodwaters surrounding their homes in Olbia, Sardinia. Hundreds have been left homeless following the storms

Last night the Costa Smeralda, the playground of the international jet set, was virtually unrecognisable.

Rivers of mud ran down the streets, train lines were destroyed and farmland disappeared under the water.

Environment
 minister Andrea Orlandi estimated that around 2,700 people have been 
displaced after their homes were submerged by water and mud.

Some spent the night in makeshift shelters in school gymnasiums, while others stayed with relatives.

Many
 Sardinians are questioning why government departments, including the 
Civil Protection Agency, did not issue warnings before the cyclone 
struck on Monday night.

However,
 agency head Franco Gabrielli defended the warning system, saying it 
worked but that nothing could predict such ‘an exceptional event’.

Rubbish: Piles of debris lie in a flooded street in the town of Olbia. The Prime Minister said today the storm was a 'national tragedy'

Flash flood: A man walks in a flooded street of Siliqua, Sardinia. The government have set aside 20 million euros in emergency funds for the clean up operation

The
 Italian government has pledged £17million to tackle the immediate 
emergency, which was described by the prime minister, Enrico Letta, as 
‘a national tragedy’.

He said: ‘At the moment the priority is saving lives.’

However, the rescue operation last night was hampered by renewed storms and the fact that many roads have been destroyed.

The rainfall caused many rivers to burst their banks, sweeping away cars and flooding homes across the island.

Prime Minister Enrico Letta said today, 'This is a national tragedy.'

Bad weather is forecast to continue today.

The
 mayor of Olbia, the northeastern 
Sardinian town that was among the worst-affected areas, said the sudden 
flooding had burst 'like a bomb'. He added that the same amount of water
 fell in 90 minutes that usually falls in the city of Milan in six 
months.

Mayor
 Gianni Giovannelli said houses across the area had been left 
half-submerged by the floods and rescuers were still searching for 
possible victims.

Livelihood: A wider view of the room showing more flooding. Authorities have said around 2,700 have been damaged

Level: A badly flooded garage in Cagliari, Sardinia, that looks out on to the flooded street in the distance where debris can be seen floating in the water

'We've just found a dead child we had been searching all night for,' he told SkyTG24 television.

Residents told of narrow escapes as sudden floods of water surged into their houses.

'We
 managed to open the door with all this water inside, it was just 
devastating. The kids didn't have anything, they were naked, naked, they
 managed to get out by the back stairs,' Olbia resident Francesco 
Brandano said.

'Everything is wet, everything needs to be thrown 
away. Everything is gone, documents, everything. We haven't got anything
 left.'

The declaration of a
 state of emergency will mean resources will reach devastated areas more
 quickly, with swathes of the island under muddy flood waters that 
covered cars and swamped houses, displacing 2,700 according to 
authorities.

The government set aside 20 million euros in immediate emergency funds to help the rescue and clean-up work. The regional government of Sardinia separately approved 5 million euros in aid funds.

The Red Cross said hundreds of people had
 been forced out of their homes and into temporary shelters set up in 
sports halls and other centres. Several bridges were swept away in Olbia
 and in the region near the central town of Nuoro.

'The situation is 
tragic,' regional governor Ugo Cappellacci told SkyTG24 television. 'The
 hotels in Olbia are full of people who have had to escape, but there 
are thousands who have damage to their homes.'

The disaster raised questions about how well prepared Italy's cash-strapped local governments, under increasing financial pressure after more than two years or recession, are to deal with sudden emergencies.

'We're facing an exceptional event here which has put our system of territorial planning and management into crisis,' said Antonello Frau, deputy head of the island's geological service.

'We really have to assess how we manage these situations, which are becoming more frequent.'

Rainfall: A woman wades through her flooded garden last night - with floodwater well above knee-level

Flooding and landslides have been common in Italy, dominated in many areas by rugged mountain ranges.

However Legambiente, Italy's main environmental group, said the disaster showed there was an urgent need to step up measures to handle floods and other disasters, a call backed by the national geological council.

It said more than 6 million Italians faced a potential risk from flooding but it said the risk had been made worse by reckless building, particularly in coastal areas.

'This is not just the fault of climate change' the association's president, Gian Vito Graziano, said in a statement.
