They were the candid photos seen across the world of a First Lady supposedly acting like an ordinary mom.

But five days after Michelle Obama 
was snapped shopping in Target, speculation is growing that the White 
House tipped off the photographer who captured the supposedly off guard 
pictures.

Mrs Obama was photographed as she left the checkout of the store in Alexandria, Virginia, on Thursday afternoon.

However, the person who took the pictures has been revealed as an Associated Press photographer, who has taken pictures of the First Lady at the White House.

Both the White House and the Associated Press have remained tight-lipped about how photographer Charles Dharapak came to be the only press photographer in the store.

'All I can say is that it was the result
 of good source work on his part,' said AP spokesman Paul Colford.

A White House spokesman also refused to comment, saying: 'It is not uncommon for the First Lady 
to slip out to run an errand, eat at a local restaurant or otherwise 
enjoy the city outside the White House gates.'

Scepticism has been growing from commentators about how the informal photographs came to be.

'First Lady Michelle Obama shopping at 
Target with an AP photographer in tow....planned? I think so,' tweeted 
Fox News host Sean Hannity.

'It has gotten so bad they had to send Moochelle out there in a Lady Gaga-type getup,' said Rush Limbaugh on his radio show as he denounced the 'photo-op'.

'One wonders if First Lady Michelle Obama truly thought she could pass 
for an ‘everywoman’ as she shopped' at Target, said Glenn Beck's website the Blaze.

Conservative blogger Michelle Malkin mocked the idea that it was a chance meeting as, 'snortalicious'.

She blogged: 'She left the bling at home. But her shirt and sunglasses are 
about as "incognito” as Lady Gaga’s outfit at her younger sister’s 
graduation.'

Radio host Rush Limbaugh also denounced the visit on his show as a 'photo-op'.

He said: 'It has gotten so bad they had to send Moochelle out there in a Lady Gaga-type getup,'

'What a phony baloney plastic banana good time rock-and-roller optic photo op this was!'

'You
 think the AP has photographers waiting outside stores for Moochelle to 
show up?" Limbaugh asked. "Who do they think we are?'

Secret
 Service officers reportedly swept the store on Highway 1, 30 minutes 
before Mrs Obama popped in for her housewives' essentials- dog food and 
cleaning products.

Wearing a Nike baseball cap, sunglasses and a floral-print button-down shirt, the usually glamorous mother walked in 
through the main entrance with just one assistant, an unknown female aide.

The former lawyer spent about 30 minutes 
minutes shopping, pushing her own trolley. She was recognised only by the 
cashier who rang up her purchases, Today reported.

After shopping for around 40 minutes she reportedly left the store with towels and cleaning supplies, according to Today.

Alongside the humble groceries were dog food and treats for First Dog Bo, People magazine reported.

Maria Panagopulos, a store manager at
 the Target in Alexandria, told NBC News claimed the store was given no 
advance notice about the first lady’s visit.

Mrs Obama checked
 out at around 3.30 pm she said, and daughters, Sasha and Malia, were 
not with her.

'People did not approach her, she was
 very incognito,' Maria Panagopulof told CNN. 'We didn't realize truly 
what was happening until she had almost left. The cashier recognised 
her, but she was very unassuming.'

'We did not have advance notice; it was as big a
 surprise to us as it was to everyone else.'

Mrs Obama's casual slip-out trip to Target has been criticised as a 
well-timed PR stunt.

Only last month the First Lady was accused of indulging in luxury holidays worth $10million dollars on the taxpayers’ dime.

And barely a week ago, the 47-year-old mother-of-two was criticised for wearing $40,000 diamonds to a fund-raising event.

Release: The photographs of Michelle Obama came as the White House released photos of her and the President meeting with Americans in September

President Obama has been seen to have been trying to recast himself since Labor Day.

He has made attacks on millionaires, corporate-jet owners, and oil companies, in what has been seen as an attempt to return to his populist persona that was seen before his election.

This weekend he released a set of official photographs that show him meeting with Americans during September.
