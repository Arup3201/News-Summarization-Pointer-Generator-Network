New York City have signed Manchester City goalkeeper Eirik Johansen on a permanent deal after impressing during pre-season.

The 22-year-old is a product of the Premier League champions' academy - having joined in August 2008 before signing a professional contract at the Etihad Stadium in 2012.

Johansen, a Norway Under 21 international, came on as a second half substitute in two matches for New York City during pre-season - first against Brondby and then in a Carolina Challenge Cup clash against Houston Dynamo.

'I had a great experience working with squad and coaches during the pre-season and I'm excited to re-join the team on permanent basis,' Johansen told the New York City's official website on Tuesday.

'The quality of the training really impressed me, as did the way the team came together in such a short period of time.'

New York head coach Jason Kreis believes the signing of Johansen merely strengthens their options in the goalkeeping department.

'We had a good look at Eirik over the course of the pre-season, and he adapted well to the team and to our style of play,' he added.

'It's always good to have strong competition for places in the team, and Eirik will add to an already strong group of goalkeepers vying for game time.

'It's a long season and guys will get their opportunities for various reasons.'

Johansen will be linking up with Frank Lampard once more when the latter's loan at Manchester City expires this season.

The former England international has been using the international break to admire the scenery of New York as he prepares for his highly anticipated move to the city's football team and Major League Soccer on July 1.

The attacking midfielder will join up with New York City after the Premier League season finishes and he has been taking time to get used to his new home city while the club season pauses for Euro 2016 qualifiers and international friendlies.

On Monday, the 36-year-old uploaded a picture to his Facebook account posing with the city providing a spectacular backdrop after going for a jog alongside fiancee Christine Bleakley.
