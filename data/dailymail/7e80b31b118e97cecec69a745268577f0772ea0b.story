A coroner has called for tougher laws on ‘legal highs’ after a 20-year-old student took one and died just one month before it was outlawed.

Tragic Grant Mace was found dead in the sea after taking methoxetamine - known as MXE or mexxy - billed as a ‘safe’ alternative to ketamine.

Grant, a first year robotics student at the University of Plymouth, died after taking the hallucinogenic drug on March 4.

Methoxetamine or MXE commonly called Mexxy is a synthetic drug sold on the internet with similar effects to Ketamine

Tragically MXE was made illegal just four weeks later on April 5, the inquest in Plymouth, Devon, heard.

Just four weeks after his death it became the first drug banned by the Government under a new temporary class drug order.

This week anti-drug campaigners have warned a new ‘legal high’ is hitting Britain’s streets every week.

Campaigners are currently calling for the Government to outlaw a substance called ‘Annihilation’ which is available legally and has been linked to several deaths in Europe.

An inquest in Plymouth, Devon, heard Grant had taken methoxetamine with two friends in his student halls.

He was found floating dead in the sea the next day and it is unclear if he went swimming or fell in.

But the inquest heard the cause of death was drowning after the drug had caused Grant to 'lose control of his mind and body'.

Plymouth coroner Ian Arrow recorded an open verdict and called for the Government to tighten the laws on legal drugs.

He said: “I’m satisfied that the drug had an adverse effect on Grant’s cognitive function and I am satisfied that he hallucinated.

'We don’t know what his movement is after that. At some stage he was in the sea, but I’m afraid the full circumstances will never be known.

'The effects of this drug are unknown and you would do things you wouldn’t normally do.

'We need to get the message out there to the people who want to take it and to the shops which sell it that this drug is dangerous and is not fit for human consumption.

'Some form of legislation needs to be put in place to prevent further deaths.'

The inquest heard Grant and two friends bought a capsule-form of the drug from a local shop and took it in the university’s hall of residence.

Grant’s friend Charlotte Bundy told the inquest: “Grant had never taken it before. It was powder in a capsule so we swallowed it.

'It’s like a legal form of ketamine and it made everything like Alice in Wonderland, it made you feel all happy and it makes it difficult for you to get about.'

The inquest heard shortly after taking the drug in student digs a fire alarm went off and Grant and his friends left the building.

But Grant was so out of it his friends lost sight of him and they tried contacting him on his mobile phone but with no success.

Grant, of Basildon, Essex, was 
spotted by a member of the public at around 10.30am the next day in the 
sea near the Royal Plymouth Corinthian Yacht Club.

The inquest heard Grant bought the drug from the Dam (corr) Good Head Shop in Plymouth.

Speaking
after the inquest, a spokesman for the shop said he had started selling
MXE after receiving 'a lot of requests' for the drug.

It was sold in the shop at £10 for 0.2g of powder and £8 for one of the 'maxi' pills.

He said: “It was more of a request thing. A lot of people ask for it and if there is demand for it I will buy it in.

'There are quite a few that we won’t touch, and I obviously won’t sell the illegal stuff.

'It has been banned now. You would be surprised how little of that you needed. That was lethal that stuff.'

The inquest was told that Mexxy was 'like a legal form of ketamine and it made everything like Alice in Wonderland, it made you feel all happy and it makes it difficult for you to get about'

Detective Constable Stuart Payne, a drugs liaison officer at Devon and Cornwall Police, told the inquest that anyone who took the drug and then entered water would 'possibly drown'.

He said: 'The drug can put you in a state where you are conscious but you’ve got no control over your body, over your body movements or your thoughts.

'You think you’re in a nice warm cosy place but really you have no control over what you are doing.

'Because of the relaxed state when you take this drug, if you are near water then the possibility is you will drown.

'It is a comparatively new substance. No one is sure what it contains.

'It’s very similar to walking into a garden centre, picking weed killer up and swallowing it to see what effect it has.'

Methoxetamine - which can easily be bought online - saw a surge in popularity in Britain and across northern Europe.

The drug, also known as MXE or mexxy, is described as having the same effect as ketamine without the side effects.

But despite claims that MXE is ‘safer’ than the illegal alternative experts say it can cause mental health problems.

It was sold online as plant feeder or bath salt.

Grant’s box of MXE was marked as ‘not fit for human consumption’, the inquest heard.
