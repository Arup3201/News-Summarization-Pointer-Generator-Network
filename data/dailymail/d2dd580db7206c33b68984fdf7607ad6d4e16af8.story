Mario Balotelli has turned heads once again with another bizarre Instagram video but this team he professes his support Liverpool ahead of their crucial clash with Manchester United. 

The Italian striker looks set to return to the squad after missing the clash with Swansea but is unlikely to start for Brendan Rodgers side with his form being less than impressive.

Balotelli, however, took to Instagram and posted the video saying he's a Reds fan.

'I support Liverpool, no matter what I support Liverpool especially tomorrow. But remember I do what I want, I do what I want and remember...yes? No? Yes? Cool.'

Liverpool can continue their surge for the Champions League places with a win on Sunday against Louis van Gaal's side.

The Red's can leapfrog United into fourth and will put themselves just three points off Arsenal, who squeezed past Newcastle on Saturday.
