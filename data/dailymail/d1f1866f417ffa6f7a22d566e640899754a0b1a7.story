Andy Williams, the silky-voiced singer whose recording of Moon River brought him fans all over the world, has died at the age of 84.

Williams passed away on Tuesday night at his home in Branson, Missouri, following a year-long battle with bladder cancer, his publicist said.

Williams revealed in November 2011 that he had been diagnosed with the disease but planned to keep performing. Until recently, he continued to appear at the Moon River Theater he built in Branson for two shows a day, six days a week, across nine months of the year.

Tributes poured in for Williams after news of his death. Singers Tony Orlando and Jimmy Osmond 
said that Williams convinced them and other performers to come to 
perform at the Moon River Theater. Orlando said the 
nation had lost a 'great treasure'.

Singer and chat show host Kathie Lee Gifford said: 'He had perhaps the most beautiful male voice ever. Perfect pitch.'

Pop star Robbie Williams tweeted: 'God bless Andy Williams. RW x.'

Williams began singing with his brothers as a child, and his easy style and mellow voice led President Ronald Reagan to call him 'a national treasure'.

The singer proved ideal for television. The Andy Williams Show, which lasted in various formats from 1957 to 1971, featured Williams alternately performing his stable of easy-listening ballads and bantering casually with his guest stars. 

He received 18 gold and three platinum albums over his long career and was nominated for five Grammy awards. He released an autobiography in 2009, Moon River And Me: A Memoir.

Though his version of Moon River made him world famous, it was among his many hits, including Butterfly and Can't Get Used to Losing You.

It was on his show that Williams 
introduced the world to the original four singing Osmond Brothers of 
Utah. Their younger sibling Donny also made his debut on Williams' show,
 in 1963 when he was six years old.

The singer's unflappable manner on television and in concert mirrored his offstage demeanor.

He once said: 'I guess I've never 
really been aggressive, although almost everybody else in show business 
fights and gouges and knees to get where they want to be. 

'My trouble is, I'm not constructed temperamentally along those lines.'

Williams' clean-cut persona, which made him a popular act in conservative Branson, also carried over into his personal life.

He was connected with scandal only once - indirectly - when his 
ex-wife, former Las Vegas showgirl Claudine Longet, shot her lover, 
skiing champion Spider Sabich, to death in 1976. The Rolling Stones 
mocked the tragedy in the song Claudine.

Longet,
 who said it was an accident, spent only a week in jail, and Williams 
provided support for her and their children, Noelle, Christian and 
Robert.

Born in Wall Lake, 
Iowa, on December 3, 1927, Howard Andrew Williams began performing with 
his older brothers Dick, Bob and Don in the local Presbyterian church 
choir when he was eight years old. Their father, a postal worker, was 
the choirmaster.

Soon after, the Williams Brothers 
Quartet landed a regular spot on Des Moines radio station WHO's Iowa 
Barn Dance. The show quickly brought attention from Chicago, Cincinnati 
and Hollywood.

Movie classic: Moon River was originally written for Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany's although it later became synonymous with Williams

They joined Bing Crosby in recording the hit Swinging On A Star in 1944 for Crosby's film Going My Way, and Andy, barely a teenager, was picked to dub Lauren Bacall's voice on a song for the film To Have And Have Not.

His voice stayed in the film until the preview, when it was cut because it didn't sound like Bacall's.

Later the brothers worked with Kay Thompson, a singer who had taken a position as vocal coach at MGM studios, working with Judy Garland, June Allyson and others.

After three months of training, Thompson and the Williams Brothers broke in their show at the El Rancho Room in Las Vegas to a huge ovation. 

They drew rave reviews in New York, Los Angeles and across the nation, earning a peak of $25,000 a week.

Williams, analyzing their success, 
once said: 'Somehow we managed to work up and sustain an almost 
unbearable pitch of speed and rhythm.'

After
 five years, the three older brothers, who were starting their own 
families, had tired of the constant travel and left to pursue other 
careers.

Despite a long catalogue of hits, the song for which Andy Williams will forever be remembered is the timeless Moon River.

Written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer in 1961, it was originally composed for the movie Breakfast At Tiffany's to be sung by Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly.

In the same year, Moon River won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. It was performed at the Oscars in 1962 by Williams who quickly became identified with the track.

Although he never released it as a single, Williams' album Moon River And Other Great Movie Themes was certified gold in 1963 after grossing $1million in sales. 

In 1992, he opened a theatre in Branson, Missouri, named after his famous song. 

Andy Williams' biography, Moon River And Me, was published in October 2009. 

Williams initially struggled as a solo act and was so broke at one point that he resorted to eating food intended for his two dogs.

'I had no money for food, so I ate it,' he recalled in 2001, 'and it actually was damned good.'

A two-year TV stint on Steve Allen's Tonight Show and a contract with Cadence Records turned things around.

The Andy Williams Show followed, along with a host of gold albums and records.

Among
 his hit records were Canadian Sunset; The Hawaiian Wedding Song; Dear 
Heart; Days Of Wine And Roses, the theme from the movie Love Story, and 
Charade.

Williams was also known for his political involvement and campaigned for his close friend Senator Robert Kennedy.

He was in Los Angeles when the senator was shot dead and sang the Battle Hymn of the Republic at his funeral, later saying it was the 'hardest thing I've ever done'.

However, Williams was not a natural Democrat and accused President Obama in 2009 of 'wanting the country to fail'.

After leaving TV, 
Williams headed back on the road, where his many Christmas shows and 
albums made him a huge draw during the holidays. 

One
 year in Des Moines, however, a snowstorm kept the customers away, and 
the band's equipment failed to reach Chicago in time for the next 
night's show, forcing the musicians to borrow instruments from a high 
school band.

'No more tours,' Williams decreed. He decided to settle in Branson, the 
self-proclaimed 'live entertainment capital of the country,' with its 
dozens of theatres featuring live music, comedy and magic acts.

When
 he arrived in 1992, the town was dominated by country music performers,
 but Williams changed that, building the classy, $13 million Andy 
Williams Moon River Theater in the heart of the city's entertainment 
district and performing two shows a night, six days a week, nine months 
of the year. Only in recent years did he begin to cut back to one show a
 night.

Not surprisingly, his most popular 
time of the year was Christmas, although he acknowledged that not 
everyone in Hollywood accepted his move to the Midwest.

'The fact is most of my friends in LA still think I'm nuts for coming here,' he told The Associated Press in 1998.

Popular venue: Although Branson was originally dominated by country singers, Williams' Moon River Theater saw a variety of musicians come to visit

He
 and his second wife, the former Debbie Haas, divided their time between
 homes in Branson and Palm Springs, where he spent his leisure hours on 
the golf course when Branson's theatres were dark during the winter 
months following Christmas.

Retirement
 was not on his schedule. As he told the AP in 2001: 'I'll keep going 
until I get to the point where I can't get out on stage.'

He continued to perform even after announcing his bladder cancer diagnosis in 2011.

Williams is survived by his wife, Debbie, and his three children, Robert, Noelle and Christian.
