President Barack Obama has dedicated the National September 11 Memorial Museum on a rainy day in Lower Manhattan, declaring 'those that we lost live in us.'

Obama toured the museum earlier in the day with Hillary Clinton and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

'I think all who come here will find it to be a profound and moving experience,' he declared, calling it 'a sacred place of healing and hope.'

'It's an honor to join in your memories, to recall and to reflect, but 
above all to reaffirm the true spirit of 9/11 - love, compassion, 
sacrifice - and to enshrine it forever in the heart of our nation," he 
told an audience of victims' relatives, survivors, and rescuers at the 
ground zero museum's dedication ceremony,' Obama said.

It was a rainy day in New York City when the National September 11 Memorial Museum was dedicated in Lower Manhattan on Thursday morning

'Like the great wall and bedrock that embrace us today, nothing can ever break us. Nothing can change who we are as Americans.'

September 
11 survivors, rescuers and victims' relatives were on hand to mark the 
opening of the museum, where the story of the terrorist attacks is told 
on a scale as big as the twin towers' columns and as intimate as 
victims' last voicemails.

It opens to the general public May 21.

After
 viewing some of the exhibits, including a mangled fire truck and a 
memorial wall with photos of victims, the president recounted the story 
of Welles Crowther, a 24-year-old World Trade Center worker and former 
volunteer firefighter who became known as 'the man in the red bandanna' 
after he led other workers to safety from the trade center's stricken 
south tower. He died in the tower's collapse.

One
 of the red bandannas he made a habit of carrying is in the museum, and 
Crowther's mother, Alison, told the audience she hoped it would remind 
visitors 'how people helped each other that day, and that they will be 
inspired to do the same in ways both big and small. This is the true 
legacy of Sept. 11.'

By her side was Ling Young, one of the people Welles Crowther rescued.

Obama spoke about the red bandana carried by Welles Crowther, who saved 12 people before being killed when he went back inside the building

Obama got an early preview of the museum with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg

'It was very hard for me to come here today, but I wanted to do so, so I could say thank you to his parents,' she said.

Another
 artifact in the museum is the voicemail that Alice Hoadland left for 
her son Mark Bingham - the last loving message before Bingham died 
aboard Flight 93 after he helped rally to counter attack that prevented 
the plane from hitting the White House.

Before
 the ceremony, Obama walked quietly through an expansive hall with 
former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. First lady Michelle Obama, 
former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton following behind them.

The
 museum, which commemorates the 2001 terrorist attack, as well as the 
1993 World Trade Center bombing, opens to the public on May 21.

Mickey Kross (a the rostrum), who served as a lieutenant in FDNY, spoke about being trapped inside the wreckage of the collapsed World Trade Tower, accompanied by ten other members of FDNY and Port Authority who were trapped with him

Emotional: Family and friends of the victims, along with survivors, took part in the tearful ceremony that recalled the heroism and tragedy of the day

The opening of the museum comes after years of fighting between groups over how 9/11 should be portrayed for history, and whether the terror attackers' Muslim faith should play a prominent part in exhibits

Former President Bill Clinton was visibly moved by the ceremony; his administration preceded the 9/11 attacks, but the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 came on his watch

New
 York Governor Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, current New
 York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New 
York Gov. George Pataki were among those attending, as was actor Robert 
De Niro, a museum board member.

By
 turns chilling and heartbreaking, the ground zero museum leads people 
on an unsettling journey through the terrorist attacks, with forays into
 their lead up and legacy.

There
 are scenes of horror, including videos of the skyscrapers collapsing 
and people falling from them. But there also are symbols of heroism, 
ranging from damaged fire trucks to the wristwatch of one of the airline
 passengers who confronted the hijackers.

'Walking
 through this museum can be difficult at times, but it is impossible to 
leave without feeling inspired,' Bloomberg said Thursday.

The
 museum and memorial plaza above, which opened in 2011, were built for 
$700 million in donations and tax dollars. Work on the museum was marked
 by construction problems, financial squabbles and disputes over its 
content and the appropriate way to honor the dead, but its leaders see 
it as a monument to unity and resilience.

The tragedy of the day is still raw with many who lost loved ones - nearly 13 years after the attacks

Cards, patches and other mementos of those killed at Ground Zero -- many left at the site's makeshift memorials in the months following the terrorist massacre -- are now on display at the National September 11 Memorial Museum

Never forget: A tribute to the firefighters killed on 9/11 is posted on the 'Final Column' displayed at the museum
