Ed Miliband will today take one of the biggest gambles of his political career by placing at risk £9million of annual union funding to his party.

The Labour leader, who is under intense pressure over his links to union paymasters, wants to tear up rules on their political levy.

In what is billed as the most significant reform of his party for a generation, he will say union members will have to ‘opt in’ to hand over an annual £3 donation to Labour, which they currently pay automatically.

Mr Miliband is desperate to regain credibility while police probe claims that members of the Unite union conspired to fix a Labour candidate selection in Falkirk.

In a major speech today, he will also call for a ‘new direction’ with the unions, even though aides conceded this may ‘take years’ to achieve.

The plan met with a furious response from Unite leader Len McCluskey last night, who has given £8.4million to Labour since Mr Miliband’s election in 2010, and who denounced the ‘opt-in’ as ‘unworkable’.

At present, three million workers, including shop staff, nurses and train drivers, automatically have the cash taken from their union subscriptions, because their unions are ‘affiliated’ to Labour. 

But the levy has long been the source of resentment for some rank-and-file members, many of whom want to belong to a union but may not support Labour.

Under Mr Miliband’s plan, members would have to ‘opt in’ to the levy instead of the status quo where they are told to ‘opt out’.

But last night it was unclear whether the plans would succeed in diluting union influence over Labour policy and elections. 

Supporters of his brother David said the plans were a ‘sticking plaster’ and warned he must go further.

Sources close to Mr Miliband would not say if he plans to change rules on electing a Labour leader – a process in which where union members still have huge influence – or whether he will dilute their voting power at party conference, where the unions still enjoy a 50 per cent block vote.

But in an article for The Guardian, Mr McCluskey wrote: ‘Switching to an “opt-in” for the political levy wouldn’t work – it would require Labour to unite with the Tories to change the law.’ 

This is a claim Labour officials deny but it remains unclear how the opt-in plans can work without union cooperation because its officials would have to administer it.

But the move was hailed by Miliband allies last night as the most significant reform to Labour since the party moved to one member one vote 20 years ago.

In a speech in central London today, Mr Miliband will seek to reclaim the initiative by condemning Unite’s activities in Falkirk as ‘a symbol of what is wrong with politics’.

He will say: ‘That was a politics closed, a politics of the machine, a politics hated – and rightly so. 

‘We need to set a new direction in our relationship with trade union members in which they choose to join Labour through the affiliation fee: they would actively choose to be individually affiliated members of the Labour Party and they would no longer be automatically affiliated.’ 

Mr Miliband will also announce that he plans to hold a primary election for Labour’s next London mayoral candidate, in which anyone who registers as a Labour supporter can vote, rather than just party members.

He is also capping the amount that can be spent on selections, and instituting a code of conduct for candidates and constituency deals with unions ‘so no one can be subjected to undue pressure’.

He will appoint a party grandee to oversee the changes. Aides admitted the party would ‘take a financial hit’ since the political levy currently raises £9million a year.

But the plans are some way short of challenging Labour’s links to the unions.

If, as expected, the number of union members formally affiliated to the party via the levy drops dramatically, union bosses could actually enjoy more power over Labour unless the leadership and conference voting rules are changed.

If the unions keep their block vote they would be able to manipulate the party by influencing just a few thousand union members.

One Miliband aide admitted union chiefs will continue to have influence. ‘The elected leadership of trade unions are extremely important. They have opinions we want to hear.’ 

In a fresh blow, the Tories yesterday asked Scotland Yard to launch an investigation into Unite activities in two other seats, Lewisham Deptford and Ilford North.

The full extent of Unite’s influence over Labour was laid bare last night when a leaked document written by the union’s political secretary revealed that the union has privately boasted of changing Labour policies and dictated the subject of Parliamentary debates.
