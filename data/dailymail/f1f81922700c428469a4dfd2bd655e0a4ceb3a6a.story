If you punch a punk or kick a metaller in Manchester, you could soon be hauled before the courts and charged with a hate crime.

Greater Manchester Police is set to become the first force in Britain to recognise attacks on members of alternative subcultures.

So now assaults on goths, emos, punks and heavy metal fans and other minority groups will be officially labelled as hate crimes.

The force will record such incidents as hate crimes in much the same way it officially recognises attacks on people due to race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity.

Inspiration: Greater Manchester Police has made the change in policy following the murder of Sophie Lancaster in 2007

The move comes after goth student Sophie Lancaster, 20, was killed after she and her boyfriend were brutally attacked in a park.

Sophie was a goth who had upwards of 
20 piercings in her face, lip and nose and liked alternative music stars
 like Marilyn Manson.

She and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, 
21, were set upon without provocation as they walked through a park in 
Bacup, Lancs in 2007.

A gang of youths, drunk on cider, 
lager and peach schnapps, kicked Mr Maltby unconscious before two of 
them turned on Sophie Lancaster.

Will classifying them as hate crimes reduce the number of attacks on goths?

The student, who was due to start an 
English degree at university a month later, was attacked as she cradled 
her boyfriend's head in her lap.

She suffered horrendous head injuries 
and was rushed to hospital where a photo was taken of her battered and 
bruised face which became a symbol of ‘Broken Britain.’

Afterwards the gang celebrated their 
attack on the goth — or ‘moshers’ - by telling friends: ‘There’s two 
moshers nearly dead up Bacup park - you wanna see them - they're a right
 mess.’

Sophie survived for 13 days in 
intensive care before her family made the heartbreaking decision to have
 her life support machine turned off.

Greater Manchester Police will be the first police force in the UK to recognise alternative sub-culture such as Goths and Emos. The move follows the brutal death of goth student Sophie Lancaster

Sophie's boyfriend Robert Malty was also brutally attacked in the park. Now the GMP will seek to protect those who are part of an 'alternative sub-culture'

Her killers, Ryan Herbert, 16, who 
admitted murder, received a 16-year minimum term while Harris, who was 
convicted after a trial, was given a minimum of 18 years.

Three other boys from the area 
admitted beating Mr Maltby, 21 – brothers Danny and Joseph Hulme, 16 and
 17, and Daniel Mallett, also 17. They were jailed for between four and 
six years.

In the wake of her death, Sophie’s 
mother, Sylvia, set up the Sophie Lancaster Foundation which dedicates 
itself to wiping out intolerance and prejudice in all walks of life.

Garry Shewan, assistant chief 
constable in Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said: ‘Sophie’s tragic 
death brought forward a need to recognise that there are many other 
victims of hate crime that should be protected by law.

‘While we have worked with the 
foundation for some time, I am proud to say we are now the first force 
in the country to officially record alternative subculture as a sixth 
strand of hate crime motivation.

‘Hate crime ruins many people’s lives 
and in some cases can tragically cost lives. We work with many 
organisations to raise the awareness of what hate crime is and how 
victims can be supported and we will continue to encourage our 
communities to challenge it, report it and help us to stop it.’

Sylvia Lancaster, founder of the 
Sophie Lancaster Foundation and Sophie’s mum, said: ‘It is a very proud 
day for me personally and the rest of the team.

‘It is a validation of the work we have undertaken in the past five years and hopefully other forces will follow GMP’s lead.’

Mr Shewan added: ‘The launch of this 
new strand of recordable hate crime is a major breakthrough. We are able
 to officially recognise that people who wish to express their 
alternative sub-culture identity freely should not have to tolerate hate
 crime – something that many people have to endure on a daily basis.’

Greater Manchester Police said it 
recognises alternative subculture as a broad term to define a strong 
sense of collective identity, values and tastes.

Distinctive style, clothing, make-up, 
body art and music preference will fall under an ‘alternative umbrella’ 
and will include goths, emos, punks and metallers - though it could also
 include other groups.

The Sophie Lancaster Foundation works 
with police forces and politicians to ensure individuals who are part of
 sub-cultures are protected by the law.
