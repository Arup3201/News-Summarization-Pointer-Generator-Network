Luke Guttridge controlled Michael Harriman’s incisive pass, rolled his marker and, with the calmest of side-foot finishes sent Luton Town top of the league.

The ecstatic roar that followed was deafening, the main stand of their 109-year-old Kenilworth Road home literally shaking in the excitement.

Once again, their defiant chant went up: ‘F*** the FA and the Football League, we are the famous Luton Town/They tried to kill us off, but we’re not so soft, we are the famous Luton Town!’

Several agonising moments later, when referee Darren Sheldrake blew the final whistle, it was replaced by another song, Queen’s Another One Bites the Dust, blasting over the PA system.

It was an apt choice. This was Luton’s seventh league win in succession, enough to take them above Wycombe and Burton to the League Two summit.

Luton played in the Championship as recently as 2007. Then everything started to go wrong. Broke and beaten down by the authorities, they suffered three successive relegations and spent five seasons in the wilderness of non-League.

The team that graced the First Division through the Eighties, and stunned Arsenal to win the League Cup at Wembley in 1988, were in danger of being forgotten, even erased.

But here, on a sunny Bedfordshire afternoon, before a sell-out crowd of more than 10,000, their restoration to the famous Luton Town of old was well on course. Little wonder the fans were singing that song.

Beaming chairman Nick Owen said: ‘We’ve been through eight difficult years. Three relegations, a total of 40 points deducted (for being in administration).

‘Down in the Conference for five years, two very frustrating play-off finals (they lost to Wimbledon in 2011 and York in 2012). But finally we’re back in League Two and top of the league. I’m so thrilled.’

It was a moment of personal redemption for Guttridge (below) too. After a frustrating season in which his time on the pitch has been restricted by a niggling foot injury, he came off the bench to haunt his former club and celebrated with a knee slide in front of the travelling fans.

He was eager to stress it was nothing personal, saying: ‘I do sincerely apologise but I play for Luton now. I have been in a lot of pain with my foot. It’s been there such a long time and in the back of your mind you do think: “Is the pain ever going to go away?”

Michael Harriman and Guttridge both played key roles in Luton's win over Northampton

‘It’s just been such a big disappointment and the celebration was all that coming out.’

Guttridge’s intervention settled a thoroughly mediocre game. Chances for either team had been a rare commodity and it looked as though Luton would be frustrated by Northampton’s second-half spoiling tactics.

But their manager John Still had other ideas, as his assistant Terry Harris revealed.

Look no further than Bournemouth’s eight-goal spree at Birmingham. 

At the end of a week in which Lee Clark was sacked, the misery around St Andrew’s was compounded by Eddie Howe’s rampant side, who recorded their biggest ever league win. 

You have to fear for the Blues, who have won just one of their last 25 home league games and are anchored in the Championship relegation zone. 

‘It was what dreams are made of here for the Luton fans,’ he said. ‘The momentum was there and as John said, “it’s made for Gutts to grab the winner” - and so it happened. Well done, John.’

Still arrived at Kenilworth Road in February 2013, after the club had got through four managers in four seasons. Slowly but surely, he has turned them around.

‘He is just an amazing guy,’ said Owen. ‘He’s got everyone onside in a club where there had been quite a lot of disaffection and things have gone so badly wrong for so long and people were disenchanted with everything.’

As Luton’s long-suffering faithful toast their ascent to the top of League Two, that disenchantment has been long forgotten.
