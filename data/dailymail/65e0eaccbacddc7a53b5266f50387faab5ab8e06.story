After two terrorist attacks in Canada in a week left two Canadian soldiers dead, ISIS has stepped up its rhetoric calling for even more radicals to carry out mass murder and mayhem in the country. 

An even more horrifying fact is that an estimated 130 Muslim youths in Canada have been seduced and radicalized by ISIS and have even left Canada behind to join forces with them.

The first attack happened Monday night -  a hit-and-run by suspected jihadist Martin Rouleau.

Jihadist tweets: ISIS supporters have taken to Twitter to call upon more lone wolf terrorist attacks in Canada 

The gunman: Alleged jihadist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was shot during an attack against Canadians on October 20 and supporters of ISIS have been glamorizing him online ever since 

The second strike was carried out by a gunman on Wendesday on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. One of the shooters, Canadian national Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, was shot dead, reportsInsite Blog.

Ever since Canada announced their involvement in the coalition against ISIS, jihadist supporters have taken to Twitter to call for 'justice' in the hopes to shake the country’s nerves by instilling fear and terror.

One such Twitter account is that of Abu Khalid Al-Kanadi who has tweeted several calls for attack and commented on Rouleu's attack on October 21, 2014.

'Muslims in Canada, follow the footsteps of our brave brother Martin Rouleau who took revenge for Canadian military aggression in our lands,' he wrote.

One day later his account was suspended.

Insite Blog reports that a second jihadist Twitter account posted on October 21 and said that Canada is 'starting to pay the price of intervention' of the war against ISIS and followed up with a second tweet urging more attacks.

'A Canadian Revert killed a Canadian Soldier then he earned Shahada at the hands of the kuffar All This reward.. without evn leaving Canada.'

Gaining support: Jihadists are hoping that by posting their opinions on Twitter more youths will join ISIS 

On the same user's Ask.fm account a different anonymous user commented on the fact that Rouleau attacked soldiers and not civilians.

'Rouleau was NOT cowardly...he attacked soldiers, not civilians.'

The writer of the post responded, 'yep..very true.'

Insite Blog adds that on the next day, the same jihadist commented on the shootings by saying, 'Canadian Soldiers told to leave their uniforms at home when out in public. Now they are like their allies the Iraqi Army.'

A separate allegedly Canadian jihadist took to Twitter to post an article about Rouleau's shooting and wrote it 'was only a matter of time' ending with '#IS.'

For jihadists on Twitter, the attacks are not against fellow Canadian citizens, rather they believe they are against soldiers fighting the ISIS movement.

'u kill innocent Muslims in Syr, Irq and so on in the na,e of dfnding agnst terrorism and u lie to the masses, dnt be surprised.'

Spreading propaganda: Charismatic online personalities are calling upon youth to join forces with ISIS 

The account of a fighter believed to be in Syria added, 'After Canada decided to Bomb and murder Muslims, Supposedly just few bullets shook all of #Canada. Expected wasnt it? #Ottawashooting.'

The Twitter account of a Dutch jihadist militant in Syria stated something along the same lines with, 'Bomb innocent people in Syria/Iraq and you expect roses and hus from Muslims back home? It's called action/reaction. Go figure.'

Another jihadist on Twitter referenced Canada's shock after the attacks and claims they should have 'expected' the retaliation.

'It's always stunning when a country that has brought violence and military force to numerous countries acts shocked and bewildered. when someone brings a tiny faction of that violence back to that country. it's not the slightest bit surprising or difficulty to understand why people who identify with those on the other end of the Canadian bombs. and bullets would decide to attack the military responsible for that violence.'

The wave of Canadians joining ISIS has fueled citizens, many of them Muslim, to fight against the radicalization of youth in the country.

Shooting: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau shot dead a soldier guarding the national war memorial before storming into the parliament on Wednesday and  was later shot dead inside the parliament after firing multiple shots

One such person is Christianne Boudreau, whose son Damian Clairmont died fighting near the Syrian city of Aleppo for jihadist causes.

'My knees are shaking so please forgive me. I’m a mother, not a public speaker,' said Boudreau at the OWN IT 2014 conference in Calgary in early October.

The OWN IT conference calls upon Muslim families to come together and fight the radicalization of Muslim youth.

The Star reports that according to the Canadian government there are about 130 jihadist fighters who've left the country to fight but that the number is growing.

Unfortunately, the Muslim community estimates that the number is already much higher.

With the popularization of Twitter and online forums as tools to express beliefs worldwide, radical youths are able to lure in other supporters from around the globe.

ISIS uses Twitter to spread propaganda and call for lone wolf attacks. 

These attackers are later revered as demigods and used as bait to call other into action.

The Star reports that having declared the Western world full of hypocrites, radicalized youth see themselves as the chosen ones, turning to online radical imams and charismatic leaders.

Community leaders have coined this jihadist online support movement the 'Sheikh Google' phenomenon.
