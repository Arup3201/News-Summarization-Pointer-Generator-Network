Previously unseen photographs showing the British band The Who performing at a tiny concert during their early days have emerged after nearly 50 years.

The 14 black and white snaps were taken at an intimate gig at the Cheam Bath Halls, Surrey, in December 1966.

One of the new-found photos shows The Who guitarist Pete Townshend, far right, performing his famous 'windmill' arm technique during the intimate gig in Surrey in 1966

One of the images shows guitarist Pete Townshend with his right arm aloft, performing his famous 'windmill' technique that he still uses today.

Another image is of the young band moments before the gig, the four young men standing behind the curtain with a crew member poking his head through a gap, as if to ask if they are ready.

The candid photos show frontman Roger Daltrey singing and Keith Moon on the drums, 12 years before his death from a drugs overdose.

The photos were taken after the legendary band had started making a name for themselves but before they shot to superstardom.

A photographer hired by concert 
promoter Danny Parker took the pictures, which are expected to fetch in 
the region of £1,000 when they go to auction next month.

Mr Parker, 66, has kept the photos in his private collection but has decided to sell them now to give him spending money for his retirement in Spain.

He said: 'It was a gig nobody really knows about, in the very early days. I was there on the night and it was a great atmosphere.

'Although they were known at the time it was actually a very small gig - they had already played bigger venues so it was good to see them with a small crowd like that.

'They were simply brilliant. They smashed all their kit on the stage at the end and the crowd went wild but unfortunately we didn’t get any pictures of that.

'Keith Moon was on the drums of course and I'm pleased to say he behaved himself that night.

'These pictures are so fascinating because it was such a small gig and that really comes across in the images. There is hardly any gap between the stage and the audience and the stage is very small.'

Catherine Southon Auctioneers are selling the snaps. She said: 'They are early photos and not publicity shots, so they have a real "behind-the-scenes" feel to them, which will make them appealing.

'When we first saw them we tentatively valued them at £200 to £300, but they are quite rare and early and offer an interesting snapshot that people will like.

'They should make somewhere towards the high hundreds mark and will be sold with copyright. They will appeal to people who collect rock and roll memorabilia, fans of The Who and dealers who deal in items such as these.'

The photographs will be sold at the auction house at Shirley Hills in Surrey, on 15 November.

The photographs were taken in 1966, when The Who had just become recognised as an important band but had not yet made their name world famous
