Gareth Bale has been supported by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez after fans booed his performance against Schalke in the Champions League.

Perez called a news conference on Thursday to back the former Tottenham forward, who has been made a scapegoat for Real’s poor recent form.

In his first season in Spain the Welshman, 25, won the Champions League and scored the winner in the Spanish Cup final. And Perez said: ‘Gareth Bale is one of the best players in the world. The biggest clubs fought and continue to fight to secure his services. We shouldn’t forget what he was able to achieve in his first year at Real Madrid.’

Florentino Perez jumped to the defence of Real Madrid's world record signing Gareth Bale on Thursday

Perez labelled Gareth Bale 'one of the best  in the world' and said he is being chased by 'the biggest clubs'

Perez claimed Real will also stand by coach Carlo Ancelotti, despite Tuesday’s 4-3 defeat by Schalke in the Bernabeu.

He said: ‘To use the fact we are not on our best form to report information that is not true is unacceptable. The club has full confidence in our coach. Contrary to a report published today, Carlo Ancelotti will remain coach of Real Madrid.’

Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard insists there is no crisis in the Barclays Premier League and is adamant English clubs will return strongly in Europe. ‘It has not been our year but English clubs will come back,’ said Gerrard, who was speaking to launch an All-Star charity game that will be staged at Anfield on March 29.

Madrid newspaper Marca ran with the headline: 'Not One More' and claimed the Italian was close to the sack

He added: ‘It is not a crisis. The teams will bounce back. Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal and ourselves will make signings and come back stronger.’

Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, who will captain the other All-Star side, feels there has been a deterioration in Premier League standards.

He said: ‘It may be because clubs have so much money. When they’re buying players in, it doesn’t mean enough, because they have that much money.’
