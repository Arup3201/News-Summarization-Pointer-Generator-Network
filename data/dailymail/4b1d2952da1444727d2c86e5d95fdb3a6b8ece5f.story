Jos Hooiveld’s close-range strike shortly after half-time was enough for Ronald Koeman’s Southampton to beat Swindon Town 1-0 during their friendly at the County Ground on Monday evening.

The centre-back broke the deadlock in the 51st minute, when he reacted quickest to James Ward-Prowse’s outswinging corner to flick the ball past the despairing dive of Swindon goalkeeper Wes Foderingham.

The Saints’ recent signing from Feyenoord, Graziano Pelle, looked lively in the opening stages, and could have put his side ahead as early as the ninth minute when he met a cross from the right by Nathaniel Clyne only to head straight into the arms of the grateful Foderingham.

Impressed: Graziano Pelle, Southampton's recent signing from Feyenoord, was strong on the ball

Fit straight in: Pelle's hold-up play against Swindon helped bring his team-mates into the game

Swindon: Foderingham; N. 
Thompson N, Kasim (McCormack 88), Branco, Barthram; L. Thompson, Rodgers
 (Barker 53), Luongo (Marshall 80), Byrne; Williams (Waldon 65), Smith 
(Randall 65).

Subs not used: Belford, Jones, Antonio, Vandesonpele.

Southampton: Davis (Gazzaniga 46); Clyne (Chambers 62), Fonte (Yoshida 62), Hooiveld (Turnbull 62), Targett (Stephens 62); Cork (Flannigan 62), Ward-Prowse (McCarthy 62); Reed (Sinclair 62), McQueen (Mayuka 46), Isgrove (Gallagher 62); Pelle (Sharp 62).

Goal: Hooiveld.

Minutes later Pelle turned provider for Clyne, but the young
full-back could not find the back of the net with his well-struck effort from
distance.

Pelle’s hold-up play was the highlight for Koeman’s team in
a fairly low-tempo affair at the County Ground, the Italian-born forward keeping
the ball well from Swindon’s dogged defenders during his 62 minutes on the
pitch.

After dominating much of the first half Southampton
deservedly went ahead six minutes after the break.

Hooiveld prodded past Foderingham from Ward-Prowse’s
enticing corner, and moments later the latter nearly doubled Saints’ lead with
a glancing header that flew just over the crossbar.

Swindon almost equalised in the dying stages of the match,
when Connor Waldon rounded Southampton’s substitute goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga.
Fortunately for the Italian shot-stopper fellow sub Calum Chambers was on hand
to smash the ball away from goal.

After the game, Koeman said: 'I think we deserved one or two more goals in the match. There was a good spirit in the team.

'Maybe in front of goal we’re not so sharp, but I’m happy about the performance today.'

Southampton’s win comes off the back of victories over
lower-league Dutch side EHC Hoensbroek and Sporting Hasselt of Belgium.
