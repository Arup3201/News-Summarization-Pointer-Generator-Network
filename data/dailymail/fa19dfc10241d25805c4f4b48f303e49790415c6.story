A builder was hospitalised for four days and underwent two operations after he was bitten by a false widow spider.

Steve Davies needed 12 stitches and almost lost his thumb when his hand swelled to twice its normal size as venom spread up his arm.

Plastic surgeons had to peel back the skin from his thumb to remove the poison after the 45-year-old was bitten for the second time in a year.

Agony: The builder's thumb swelled up immediately, left, and he required 12 stitches, right

'My hand just swelled up with all the poison and it was incredibly painful and double the size,' Mr Davies said. 'It honestly felt like it was going to explode.

'The plastic surgeons said I was lucky not to lose the thumb because the poison had gone into the muscle.

'They had to knock me out to slice it open in a huge zig-zag shape and peel back the skin like a banana to get to all of the poison.

'But they had to leave it all open so they could get back in the next day to check for more, and I was in hospital for four days.

'All that for a tiny spider bite - I couldn't believe it.'

In hospital: The 45-year-old had to have two operations to drain the venom from his arm in August

Mr Davies, from Muswell Hill in North London, received his first false widow bite on his finger in August last year while working in a garden.

He went to hospital when his hand swelled up and was given intravenous antibiotics to fight the infection, which was cured within a few days.

In August this year, he was again bitten on his right thumb while clearing out a shed.

'I felt it this time straight away and I knew what it was this time - it was very painful,' he said.

Swelling: The first time Mr Davies was bitten, right, his hand recovered within a few days, but the second bite, right, had more serious consequences

Danger: This year has apparently seen an epidemic of bites from the false widow spider (file photo)

Doctors gave him antibiotics, but his hand turned red and doubled in size, and eventually the venom spread up his arm, turning the whole limb red.

He returned to A&E three days after being bitten, and was sent to see specialist surgeons at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.

Mr Davies was put under general anaesthetic as doctors removed the toxic poison and after 12 stitches, four days on the ward and a further two weeks off work he was back on the building site.

But the bite was so severe he thinks he could need further surgery.

'I still wake up every day with a very stiff thumb and all my fingers,' he said. 'They think the poison has spread into the fingers, and obviously they didn't actually clear those out.'

Back to work: Mr Davies has returned to his job as a builder
