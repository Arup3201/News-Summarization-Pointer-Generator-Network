Sam Allardyce lingered by the touchline, his hand theatrically cupped to his ear as the boos and jeers came tumbling from the main stand at Upton Park. He attempted a mocking smile but he could not disguise his confusion. It was a curiously compelling image.

A few moments earlier, West Ham had completed a fortuitous win over a Hull City side which had played for more than an hour with 10 men. But a win is a win, three points are three points. As the perplexed manager put it: ‘I’ve never been in a place where we have won and got booed. I couldn’t believe it.’

It was a pity that he wasn’t around to hear the call which a gentleman named Simon made to Radio 5 Live shortly afterwards. Simon, it seems, has been a West Ham season-ticket holder for more than 30 years. He sounded informed, reasonable and thoroughly exasperated.

On the up: Mark Noble scored the opening goal against Hull as they pulled clear of the relegation zone

He acknowledged that, as a West Ham fan, he didn’t expect to win titles or trophies. But he did expect something better than this. ‘It’s just the turgidness of the performance,’ he said.

‘It’s £42 to get into each game, sometimes more, depending on the opposition, and it’s just  boring. This is the most turgid, boring side. If I wasn’t a West Ham supporter and you gave me a ticket, I wouldn’t watch it. It’s so one-dimensional. It’s just awful  to watch.’

He appreciated that there are only so many good players to go around the English game. But he explained: ‘If you can’t get your head up and buy yourself a little bit of time, if you haven’t got the quality to do that and play simple 10-yard passes, if the only thing you’ve got is a smash-up ball to Andy Carroll, well...! And you want me to pay £42 to watch it!’

There is a patronising assumption that football fans are unconcerned with frivolous qualities such as touch, technique and  imagination. They want grafters, scrappers, uncomplicated battlers. And certainly it is much easier to hire muscular journeymen than to develop  creative artists.

And yet, when they are offered something more adventurous, more demanding, they may react with enthusiastic approval.  Consider the work done by Brendan Rodgers at Swansea and now Liverpool.

Or the way in which Roberto Martinez operated at Swansea and now Everton. Or the influence of Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton. Not one of these men could have  tolerated the kind of scowling, intimidating sides which Allardyce churned out at Bolton, briefly at Newcastle, at Blackburn and now at West Ham.

Exciting: Everton have passed their way into fifth place and a possible spot in the Champions League

In truth, at each place he found a degree of approval, especially in the early days. But as time went on, his joyless pragmatism provoked precisely the same kind of reaction which Simon articulated the other evening. Yet  disapproval will scarcely dent Allardyce’s self-esteem. This, after all, is the man who criticised the influence of foreign managers on the English scene and famously declared that he would have been offered the England job if his name had been ‘Allardici’.

Equally celebrated was his  contention that he wasn’t much suited to the likes of Bolton or Blackburn. ‘I would be more suited to Inter Milan or Real Madrid,’ he mused. ‘It wouldn’t be a problem for me to manage those clubs because I would win the Double or the league every time. Give me Manchester United or Chelsea and I would do the same. It wouldn’t be a problem.’

And even as we mocked his shameless self- delusion, we marvelled at his ability to persuade people to offer him lucrative employment, equip him with a handsome transfer budget and entrust him with the future of their football club.

Not pretty: Allardyce spent £15million on Andy Carroll

Which is why we find the man who paid £15million for Andy Carroll pacing the dugout at Upton Park, watching the ball being battered high and hopeful, occasionally stepping on a sign which proclaims the place: ‘The Academy of Football’.

The boos and jeers are growing louder as the prevailing ugliness is emphatically rejected but Allardyce cannot comprehend, much less sympathise with, the disapproval. For in his world, ends justify means. Or, as he has frequently observed: ‘We are in a results business.’

It is an unthinking cliché. It is also quite mistaken. The National Lottery is a ‘results business’, likewise the Stock Exchange. Football is something quite different.

Its appeal was defined most beautifully by a dreamer named Danny Blanchflower. ‘The game is about glory,’ he said. ‘It is about doing things in style, with a flourish, about going out and beating the other lot, not waiting for them to die of boredom.’

In a couple of sentences, Danny distilled all the charm, the wonder, the timeless appeal of the game he loved so well.

I can imagine Sam Allardyce listening to those words with his hand cupped to his ear; smiling his mocking smile, and failing to conceal his abject confusion.

R&A pompous and blinkered to the bitter end

On Thursday, September 18, the members of the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of  St Andrews may decide to admit women to their ranks.

In the year of grace 2014, that opening sentence seems a ludicrous anachronism. But when Peter Dawson, the chief executive of the R&A, can commend the move by reflecting that ‘society is changing, sport is changing’, then truly we are living in revolutionary times. If club ties and brass-buttoned blazers could speak, then  they would sound just  like Dawson.

For year after year he has defended the exclusion of women by mumbling the same, fatuous mantra: ‘There’s no particular pressure from inside golf about this but the media clearly have it on their agenda. It’s not an issue people talk to me about  very much.’  In short, it is  just a conspiracy of ‘the chattering classes’.

Progress: Peter Dawson has commended the move to allow women into the R&A

So the R&A continued their 260-year-old custom of denying membership to more than half the population of the planet, while awarding the Open Championship to clubs — Muirfield, Royal Troon, Royal St George’s — who operate the same indefensible policy.

So what has brought about this tectonic shift? We may discount considerations such as conscience, morality and an awareness of their own absurdity. No, they have been pushed by commercial and political pressures, as well as the powerful Olympic movement, which recently adopted golf as an Olympic sport and now requires it to behave in a civilised manner.

Regrettably, neither the  R&A nor its chief executive are quite ready to embrace the 21st century. Dawson refuses to give an assurance that men-only clubs will never again stage an Open. And, astonishingly, he is allowing the members’ vote to clash with the Scottish independence referendum.

He explains: ‘It is enshrined in our constitution that the business meeting takes place the day before the last day  of Autumn Medal week.’

It is unwittingly hilarious,  a classic case of blinkered pomposity. Quite frankly, the women can’t get there soon enough.

P.S.

Dean Ryan coaches Worcester Rugby Union club. On Sunday they visit Newcastle for an Aviva Premiership match. Worcester have had a difficult season but is their coach downhearted? Not at all. ‘Despite being 12 points adrift at the foot of the table, I feel we’re in  a good place,’ he declares.

Worcester may yet survive but, even if the worst happens, then Mr Ryan should not worry. Instead, he should look beyond the oval-ball game. A coach capable of delivering a line like that would stroll into any job the Premier League has to offer.
