Jose Mourinho snorts in derision and dismisses with a smile the suggestion that it is the first cup he won as a manager. And Patrick Kluivert says he cannot even remember scoring the winning goal.

But Barcelona's 3-0 win over Mataro in the Catalan Cup final of 2000 in the modest Olympic Stadium of Terrassa, nonetheless, remains a match of great significance for today's Manchester United and Chelsea managers.

Though Mourinho has gone on to win more precious silverware, it was the first time he won something in charge of a team and he did so under the tutorship of his mentor and Sunday's opponent Louis van Gaal.

The relationship between Van Gaal and Mourinho has been much discussed, not least since Van Gaal paid a fulsome tribute to Mourinho last January at the Football Writers' Association tribute night.

Mourinho was expecting the sack when Van Gaal was appointed as the new coach of Barca in 1999, with his previous mentor, Bobby Robson, being ushered into an upstairs role.

Perhaps that explains why the 36-year-old Mourinho angrily took Barca directors to task in a swish restaurant where the arrangements were being discussed with Van Gaal, Robson and Mourinho. After all, he alone would be unemployed at the end of it all. Back then he was a mere appendage to Robson, dismissed internally as 'the translator'. But Van Gaal took note. 'I liked his loyalty and anger,' he said. 'And here was a man who already knew the club and could be useful.'

When the call came, Mourinho was preparing to leave the club. 'He had expected the sack at that time and was astonished when Van Gaal offered him a role,' said a friend of Mourinho. 'I remember him ringing me up to say he had been offered the job and was absolutely stunned.'

He was to become Van Gaal's most favoured assistant, even though a Dutchmen, Frans Hoek — still with Van Gaal at United as his goalkeeping coach — and Gerard van der Lem as well as Barca favourite, Jose Mari Bakero, were on his staff. 'Soon it was clear that he was the assistant Van Gaal trusted most, even though he hadn't previously known him,' said Mourinho's friend. 'For one thing, he had been there for years and knew the club and the players. And the players really liked him.'

There was an unwitting role for former Newcastle winger Keith Gillespie, too. Van der Lem prepared scouting reports for Van Gaal and, when Barcelona drew Newcastle in the Champions League, Van der Lem was dismissive of Gillespie, telling Van Gaal and left-back Sergi they had nothing to fear from him.

Yet on the night Gillespie was unstoppable, setting up two goals as Faustino Asprilla's hat-trick saw Newcastle win the game 3-2. To be fair to Van der Lem, Gillespie's performance was exceptional and hardly typical of his career. But it was enough to give Mourinho a break. 'After that Van der Lem was out and Mourinho was in,' said a member of the club's staff at the time. Van der Lem was still an important part of the staff but was no longer in charge of the scouting reports; instead Mourinho's meticulous dossiers became the norm for Barca players.

Further signs that Mourinho was Van Gaal's star pupil came when he handed over the reins of the first team for the Catalan tournament. Mark the date: March 25, 1998. Jose Mourinho took charge of a first-class football team for the first time. The Catalan Cup is clearly a secondary affair for a club chasing European glory but nevertheless, given the sensibilities of the club's status in Catalunya, it cannot be ignored and the manager of the day usually takes charge.

In that first year, Mourinho took the team and won the semi-final against Lleida, though in a serendipitous note, the late Tito Vilanova, whose eye Mourinho would later gouge during a Barca-Real clash, scored for Lleida. Van Gaal took charge for the final, which Barca lost but Mourinho was back in charge again in 1999, when they lost the semi-final to Lleida.

The reason why Mourinho does not count the 2000 triumph as his first trophy is because, in his eyes, he was just the assistant. But that is not strictly true. There was an expectation that Van Gaal would again take charge of the team for the final, as he had in 1998. But instead he allowed Mourinho to stay in control.

Mourinho said: 'I took the team but he was in the stands. He was there to support. He came down at half-time to the dressing room to listen to my team talk. He didn't want to interfere, because probably he thought that was right. He did with me what I do with my assistants, give them not just responsibility, but also give them the tools for evolution, support an evolution and make them ready for a possible next step, if one day they decide to do it. It's normal.'

And though these games were not quite the star-studded first XI, there were some world-renowned stars in his team. When Mourinho won the cup, his team contained Kluivert, Xavi, Sergi and Emmanuel Amunike. And he is grateful for the opportunity: 'I accepted it as a gift for somebody that was giving everything and was working hard. Good memories.'

Mourinho's charisma was key to him winning over players at the time. 'You saw it with Jose from the beginning,' said Kluivert. 'Though he hadn't played, he wasn't a big name, he had charisma towards the group. The things he said really communicated. That was the most important thing. He knows how to talk to people as an individual and that was the difference with him. Everyone is different so you need to deal with them individually and he did that. Sure, he helped me. He helped everyone.'

Robson gave Mourinho his chance but it was Van Gaal who gave him his head and, in doing so, helped create the iconic manager of today.

Van Gaal always talks positively about his time with Mourinho but you cannot help but wonder whether, privately, he has the odd doubt. Mourinho beat Van Gaal at the 2011 Champions League final and today at Old Trafford his Chelsea team look much better set up than Van Gaal's.

Like Victor Frankenstein, perhaps Van Gaal did not quite anticipate just what he was creating.
