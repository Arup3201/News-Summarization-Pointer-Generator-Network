Seven points. All that separates Premier League leaders Chelsea and third-placed Arsenal, two sides who, up until the last couple of months, were deemed to be having wildly contrasting seasons.

How times change. The Gunners are on a hot streak and the champions-in-waiting are stuttering, having drawn their last two league games at fortress Stamford Bridge.

Manchester City still sit second despite Saturday evening's deflating defeat by Burnley but Manuel Pellegrini's men are out of form and look increasingly unlikely to retain their crown.

That leaves Arsene Wenger's side as the biggest threat to Chelsea, something which seemed almost unthinkable come the final hours of New Year's Day.

Arsenal fell to sixth on January 1 after a woeful 2-0 defeat by fellow Champions League chasers Southampton, a result best remembered for two Wojciech Szczesny howlers.

But, with summer signing David Ospina establishing himself as the club's No 1, the Gunners have been on an upward trajectory ever since.

One league defeat - albeit to north London rivals Tottenham - is the only blot on their record since that forgettable day at St Mary's, while a return of 24 points from a possible 27 is the best in the division.

Saturday's comfortable 3-0 win against West Ham was Arsenal's eighth consecutive victory at home, a feat they last achieved at Highbury in 2005.

And that run, combined with Chelsea's lacklustre 1-1 draw with Southampton on Sunday, left Jose Mourinho admitting that the north Londoners can be considered title challengers. 

'Of course Arsenal are in it,' he said. 'They are seven points behind Chelsea, but have one less match to play than Chelsea.

The only defeat in Arsenal's last nine league games came against Tottenham; they've won the other eight

'Both City and Arsenal are in the title race. It depends on the momentum for Arsenal - the 3-1 defeat against Monaco or the 3-0 defeat against West Ham?

'So the danger is always there. But I keep saying, we are there. If someone had told me in August that, at the end of March, we'd be six points in front with a match in hand, I'd have signed for that immediately.'

Mourinho is a master of mind games and may well have been attempting to pile pressure on Olivier Giroud and Co ahead of a crucial nine-match run-in.

But the fact remains that Arsenal - and Wenger in particular - have history when it comes to late title charges. Just cast your mind back to March 1998.

The Gunners were 12 points behind Manchester United and had three games in hand with a little over two months of the season remaining but went on a magnificent 10-match winning run to wrap up the title with two games to spare.

The task this time around is undoubtedly more difficult, particularly given Chelsea's extra game, but Arsenal's superb home form and some favourable fixtures should at least offer fans some hope.

As well as having an opportunity to claw back three points against the leaders at the Emirates on April 26, they also have games against struggling Newcastle, Burnley, Hull and Sunderland to look forward to.

A home clash with in-form Liverpool next month and a trip to Manchester United in the season's penultimate fixture will be tough, although last week's FA Cup win at Old Trafford should fill Wenger's squad with confidence.

Chelsea also have some games they will relish but the visits of United and Liverpool to Stamford Bridge at least offer potential for Mourinho's men to drop points.

It will need to be some slip-up for Arsenal to take advantage like they did 17 years ago but Wenger's men - who could well be free of Champions League football this week - should not be discounted.

It might not be the title race we expected two-and-a-half months ago but Chelsea cannot breathe easy just yet.
