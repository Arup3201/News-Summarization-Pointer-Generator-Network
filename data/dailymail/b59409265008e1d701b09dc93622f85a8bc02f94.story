Lying undiscovered in a box in an attic for nearly 40 years, these are the unseen images of the Rolling Stones at a photo shoot for one of their most iconic albums.

At the height of their fame in 1971, the band is captured chatting, laughing and occasionally Mick Jagger is even yawning nonchalantly as they pose for their Sticky Fingers album cover.

The pictures, taken by photographer Peter Webb, show guitarist Mick Taylor in one of his first official appearances with Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman.

In the end only a few images were ever released and the band eventually opted for their infamous and suggestive zipper cover, created by Andy Warhol and Craig Braun.

However, the final colour image ‘Leaning Stones’ from the shoot was published and voted by Q Magazine as one of the top 100 rock ’n’ roll photographs of all time.

A grainy black and white image entitled ‘The Big Yawn’ with Jagger standing to one side yawning while Wyman scratches his nose was printed on the inside sleeve of the album – their first of the 1970s and first to be released on their new label, Rolling Stones Records.

For many critics it is the band’s best album.

The collection of photographs was only discovered after Webb’s brother-in-law, Bill Pierce, also a photographer, found the negatives in a dust-covered box in his attic.

‘After they were found I walked around with this huge smile on my face for days,’ says Webb. ‘Who would have thought 40 years later the Rolling Stones would still be touring?’

This is one of the many images that went unseen after the shoot which was commissioned for Sticky Fingers

Webb, a Cambridge graduate, learnt his trade in America as an assistant to photographer and film director Howard Zieff, whose films include Private Benjamin and My Girl.

On his return to London he made his name as an advertising photographer and was spotted by David Puttnam, the filmmaker who at the time was working as a photographer’s agent.

The future Lord Puttnam invited Webb to shoot his ‘friends’ the Rolling Stones for the cover of Sticky Fingers.

After the band showed little interest in his original ideas, Webb decided to photograph them in a line up ‘like Dad’s Army’.

He recalled: ‘I had been advised by a photographer friend that the band “were trouble” to photograph and they could end up throwing V-signs to the camera.’

But he found the band to be surprisingly well behaved.

Webb said: ‘They were not only compliant to my instructions in arranging them, but even seemed somewhat camera shy, which was totally unexpected.

‘I had to ask them to act a little more threateningly, to which they duly obliged.’

He then took portraits of each band member, provoking Jagger to remark: ‘Passports is it now, mate?’

After the shoot, Webb went on to set up his own studio, directing the BAFTA-winning film Butch Minds the Baby and Give My Regards to Broad Street.

But, caught up in the excitement of transforming his dark room into a cutting room, he forgot that he had handed his brother-in-law a folder of negatives to store.

It was in 2009 that he got a telephone call from Pierce.

He recalls his brother-in-law saying: ‘I’ve found an unmarked box of negatives in the attic. I think they’re your Rolling Stones pictures.’
