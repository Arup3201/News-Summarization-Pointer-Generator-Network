England’s attention to detail for the World Cup will see a delegation of more than 70 going to Brazil in the official FA party.

A sign that the backroom staff would be bigger than ever for a major tournament was the numbered, Nike-supplied luggage carried by World Cup-bound FA personnel at the training week in the Algarve.

The suitcase tally was as high as 59 for the support team and the senior coaching group have been given initialled luggage rather than numbered cases. Numbers one to 23 are reserved for Roy Hodgson’s squad, so their World Cup shirt numbers announced on Thursday correspond to the figures on their bags.

The FA say their 70-plus party is smaller than other countries’, although the extra emphasis on sports science increases the number that went to South Africa in 2010.

The estimated breakdown is 23 players plus two on standby, one manager, three coaches, one performance chief, one psychiatrist, two sports scientists and two exercise scientists.

One physio, three masseurs, three video analysts, three kit managers, one doctor, one nutritionist, one osteopath, one chef, four security personnel, two administrators, one travel manager and one commercial expert.

Six from communications, six international committee members, a sponsor and four Club England officials.

Conspicuous by his absence from the lavish BBC theatre tribute to the late, great broadcaster David Coleman was Des Lynam, widely regarded as the most accomplished sports TV host since Coleman. The pair never got on for a number of reasons, including professional rivalry.

There is upset among Yorkshire’s 40 honorary life members and vice-presidents, who include England greats Geoff Boycott, Michael Vaughan, Bob Appleyard, Ray Illingworth, Brian Close and Darren Gough, that they will not have automatic access to the VIP hospitality Hawke Suite during the Sri Lanka Test at Headingley.

Yorkshire say their boardroom facility is too small when the ECB hierarchy are also being entertained and the former stars have all received invites for at least one day of the Test.

New Yorkshire president Dickie Bird has chosen the ECB’s managing director Paul Downton to be a guest.

Two representatives plus partners from each Football League club will attend the Tivoli Marina Hotel in Vilamoura for the FL’s so-called summer meeting, although the dedicated vacation hotel overlooking marina and beach is an unlikely conference setting. At least the FL have dropped the charade of claiming their beano is cheaper than holding the two-day summit at home.

Scholes seeks spotlight

The most surprising media contract in recent times involves Paul Scholes, who shunned the limelight throughout his stellar football career.

The former Manchester United midfielder has signed up to do a World Cup blog for bookmakers Paddy Power, who are the most ravenous of publicity seekers.

It seems Scholes now wishes to heighten his profile.

He claimed on TV that Jack Wilshere had not improved since he was 17 and blogged on Thursday that Wayne Rooney ‘isn’t great with partnerships’.

Ding Junhui, winner of five snooker tournaments last season, missed the sport’s awards dinner at London’s Royal Lancaster Hotel, just as Luis Suarez had skipped collecting the Footballer of the Year trophy at the same venue.

But while there was no censure for Suarez going home to Uruguay, Ding was fined £5,000 by World Snooker for missing the function because he was in China.

B teams competing in a fifth-tier League Three — the central plank of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission proposals — looks to have been kicked into the long grass by the FA themselves.

The FA Council debate on the commission welcomed some of Dyke’s initiatives but not Plan B.

Predictably, fans’ chief Malcolm Clarke complained about the lack of consultation with supporters.

Less expected was John Ward, who chairs a committee reviewing the Football League pyramid, claiming he wasn’t consulted either.
