Those people using Facebook to find love might be disheartened by the number of happy couples parading their love, marriage, babies and joint mortgages across everyone's walls.

So if you're looking for a site that ticks all the Facebook fun boxes but features only singles looking for romance, download TrueView, a new dating app that uses real-time micro-blogging to hunt down potential matches.

The award-winning free mobile application enables users to create a simple profile, then update it minute-by-minute with whatever they are doing throughout the day, just as you might on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Do you like to share the intricacies of your day with perfect strangers? If so, TrueView - a micro-blogging dating app that enables you to tell people what you are doing every minute of the day -  could be your ticket to love

An advert for the TrueView app describes the new programme as 'the future of online dating'

Invented by three young men in east London who gave up their 9-5s after coming up with the idea, the app is the ideal dating tool for the quintessential over-sharer, who likes to report back to the world whenever they make a cup of tea, drink a cup of tea, wash up the cup of tea and relax, post-tea.

Because if you're ever going to find someone who also likes sharing every nanosecond of their day, it's here.

Whenever you power up the app, it will ask you to 'check in', and offers you a blank box in which to scribble whatever it is you'd like to share, under the headings Culture, Food, Music, Outdoors, Relaxation, Shopping, Social, Sports, Film, Travel and Work.

There is also plentiful supply of sub-heads, so you might be 'chained to my desk' at work, 'watching the match' in the pub, 'expanding my mind' at a film night, or 'embarrassing myself' in a social situation.

You can also mark your location so you can see if any potential dates are nearby.

'Rather than writing a profile to sell yourself with what you think other users will want to hear, you can log when you go to your favourite restaurant or watch your favourite film'

Founders Andrew Ibbotson, 31, Matt Verity, 31, and Damian Mitchell, 36, told startups.co.uk: 'TrueView is a dynamic, location-based dating app, which lives alongside you and updates all the time, bringing an exciting new approach to the online dating industry.

'Rather than writing a profile to sell yourself with what you think other users will want to hear, you can log when you go to your favourite restaurant or watch your favourite film.

'That evolves users’ profiles to match them with people who they actually have common interests with.

'Online dating is a saturated market, in which businesses believe it helps to give you hundreds of results (including out-of-date profiles), most of which don’t fit the bill.

'TrueView actually reduces choice by only giving you matches that are relevant to you. It will revolutionise the online dating market, making it safe, secure, and most of all, fun.'
