Positive economic data and signs of compromise in Congress have the International Monetary Fund predicting faster economic growth in the United States next year.

IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde also praised the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement last week that it intends to scale back its massive monetary stimulus.

'Growth is picking up,' Lagarde said. 'And unemployment is going down. So all of that gives us a much stronger outlook for 2014, which brings us to raising our forecast.'

Things looking up: IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde announced Sunday that the Washington-based lender will upgrade their economic forecast for the U.S. for the coming year

The IMF forecast in October that the U.S. economy would expand 2.6 percent in 2014 after growing 1.6 percent this year. At the time, Lagarde warned that Congressional failure to raise the U.S. debt ceiling could damage not only the United States, but the rest of the global economy.

A U.S. Congress, deeply divided along party lines, did manage to pass a limited, two-year budget deal last week to trim some planned spending cuts and reduce the risk of a government shutdown.

Yet the legislation does nothing to avoid a possible U.S. debt default that could occur if Congress does not raise a cap on U.S. borrowing.

President Barack Obama's administration has warned that the government could run out of borrowing authority needed to pay its bills as soon as February if lawmakers do not swiftly raise the debt ceiling.

Success?The IMF's decision was based in part on the U.S. Federal reserve's decision to trim its aggressive bond-buying program on Wednesday but sought to temper the long-awaited move by suggesting its key interest rate would stay lower for even longer than previously promised

'The budget deal that was cut at year-end is a very good sign of...responsibility, accountability and realism,' Lagarde said on Sunday's Meet the Press.

'I certainly hope that in February, Congress will be equally responsible and will not threaten the recovery with yet another debate about whether or not the U.S. honor or default.'
