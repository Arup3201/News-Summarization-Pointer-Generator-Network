She has seen distinguished diplomatic service in Washington DC and Sri Lanka.

But on her latest mission to Tehran, Pumpkin the terrier found herself embroiled in a diplomatic incident as hundreds of protesters chanting ‘Death to England’ stormed the British Embassy and looted the residence of her master, Ambassador Dominick Chilcott.

As the violent mob attacked the building, damaged valuable oil paintings and stole a photograph of the Queen, Mr Chilcott took refuge in a secure room on the third floor of the Embassy’s chancery.

Frightening: Britain's ambassador to Iran, Dominick Chilcott (left), fled the British Embassy in Tehran with his beloved dog (right) in his arms after protestors stormed the building.

After escaping the siege and returning
to Britain with his wife Jane and fellow staff, Mr Chilcott has spoken 
with sadness about having to leave behind Pumpkin, a seven-year-old 
Norfolk terrier/Jack Russell cross.

Sources said the Ambassador was unable
to bring back his pet because he put the safety of his staff first; and
as he and other officials returned on a commercial flight, there was 
insufficient time to arrange for a crate in the aircraft’s hold in which
to transport Pumpkin.

Mr Chilcott, who only took up his post
in October, said: ‘Because my wife was leaving the compound ahead of 
the demonstration, we didn’t want to leave a dog on its own with all the
local staff gone as well.

‘I took the dog into the chancery, 
into my office, so that she could be with me while the demonstration 
happened and then I could return her to the house afterwards and to my 
wife.

‘But, of course, that’s not how things worked out.

‘Alarms go off in those sort of situations, when there are people attacking your building.

Ruined: Another portrait of royalty damaged in the riot as protesters attempted to make their views known of British values

‘It’s very noisy as well as quite unsettling and frightening, particularly for the dog.

‘I had her in my arms for quite a lot of what was going on. She was very well behaved.

‘She’s been through this traumatic 
experience and we’ve put her in the good care of some diplomatic 
colleagues from another country. We hope we will be reunited with her in
due course.’

Support: Holding wreaths of flowers and a poster of Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a group of demonstrators also wait to welcome the Iranian diplomats

The Iranian thugs – objecting to UN 
sanctions against Iran – tore in two an oil painting of Queen Victoria 
worth at least £30,000, cut out the head of Edward VII from a portrait 
worth around £5,000, and stole a framed photograph of the Queen.

The Queen Victoria portrait – showing 
her seated and wearing a flowing gown – is an original from 1863 by 
British artist George Hayter. It was personally commissioned by 
Victoria.

Art historian Brian Sewell said last 
night that the Queen Victoria portrait could probably be restored, but 
the Edward VII painting ‘looks a hopeless case because it is so badly 
damaged’.

Students from some universities and seminaries burned British flags as they clashed with police, while others held flags proclaiming their hatred of Britain

Protests: Students set fire to British and Israeli flags after breaking into the British Embassy. Tehran has denied any responsibility - although William Hague has accused officials of being complicit

Breaking in: Dozens of protesters enter the gate of the embassy, throwing rocks, petrol bombs and burning documents looted from offices

Get out: Diplomats had until yesterday afternoon to leave the Iranian Embassy and get out of Britain

On the move: Men carry boxes out of the Iranian embassy
