Jonny Brownlee sacrificed hopes of a World Series title this season for Commonwealth glory, but he insists he still wants to prove a point to rival Javier Gomez in the final two races.

It was never a secret the 24-year-old had his sights set on Glasgow gold this summer, with early-season disappoints in Yokohama and London evidence of a man who wasn’t yet at the peak of his powers.

His plan paid off though as Strathclyde County Park proved a fruitful venue – Brownlee taking silver in the individual event and a gold in the relay with older brother Alistair, Jodie Stimpson and Vicky Holland.

Attentions now focus back on the World Series with Stockholm the venue for the penultimate leg this weekend, ahead of the Grand Final in Edmonton, Canada.

And Brownlee insists while Gomez may have an unassailable lead at the top of the standings, he wants to finish the stronger with two wins from as many races.

'It has been an alright season but t has been a season of two halves,' said Brownlee. 'It didn’t start too well as I did a lot of travelling and went to Auckland, Yokohama and Cape Town and I didn’t pick up many great results.

'My focus even then really was on the Commonwealth Games, that was what I wanted to do well in, but now with that done I can do better in the second half of the season.

'The Commonwealth Games was something that I aimed for at the start of the year and it is always great when you do well in what you have aimed for.

'To then complete the set as well for me is fantastic, as a kid I never thought I would reach this level so I am thrilled.

'I don’t think I am going to be able to become world champion now, I am behind Javier Gomez by quite a few points so I will struggle to beat him even if I do win the last two races.

'To be a world medallist and a Commonwealth medallist makes it a decent season really. I am racing in Stockholm next and that will be an interesting race as after a major Games it is always quite difficult to pick it up again but I’m back training and I want to do that.

Rivals: Brownlee and Javier Gomez have been going tooth and nail against each other during the World Series

'With two races left and because I won’t be able to win the World Series itself I want to focus all my energy on them and treat them as a mini world championships, I want to win them both.'

Brownlee was allowed some downtime after the Games and in his role as a BT ambassador attending an athletics coaching session with members of The Bridge – a learning disability service for community health development organisation Health For All.

The session, which took place at the John Charles Centre for Sport in Leeds, was held by charity Join In and formed part of their All Join In campaign, which aims to highlight the opportunities for integration of disabled and able-bodied sport.

The next event on the calendar for their campaign is All Join In Week, which runs between August 23 and 29 – and Brownlee believes the general public can all find something rewarding from volunteering their time.

Point to prove: Brownlee wants to show Gomez what he's got in the final two races of the season

'It was inspiring for me to see people not being scared of taking something on and taking a chance is fantastic,' he added.

'Volunteering is crucial in all sports, if it wasn’t for volunteers I wouldn’t be Commonwealth champion or an Olympic medallist.

'For me personally I have not done much volunteering in sport and definitely not disability sport so All Join In Week is about encouraging people to do that.

'It might be something completely new, you may be a little nervous about it, but sport is perfect for breaking down barriers.'
