It seems that Nicholas Sparks' bird flew the nest over a month ago.

The author's wife, Cathy Sparks, paid $1.1million for a North Carolina mansion back on December 9, a month before the two announced they were splitting after 25 years.

She didn't go far though, as the home is just over two miles from the family home in the town of New Bern.

Moving on: The couple recently announced they are splitting after 25 years

Nice digs: The home sits on four acres of lakefront property and is just a few miles from where her family lives

The home is fairly modest and sits on 4 acres of lakefront property.

It is a huge departure from the massive estate the author built just three years ago and where Cathy was living, with a bowling alley, screening room, and even a hidden room for napping in the basement.

As TMZ previously reported, the couple signed a postmarital agreement back in August meaning that they have settled all their property and that neither side will receive alimony.

They have not however filed their divorce documents yet.

Sparks, who has written 17 novels - and seen almost all of them go on to become Hollywood films - including The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, Message in a Bottle and The Last Song, had spoken of how hard he and his wife work on their relationship in past interviews.

'There are people who are probably much better at marriage than I am – they've lasted a lot longer,' he told People in 2003. 

'I could probably learn from them.'

He has also revealed that he met his wife on a Monday and told her he was going to marry her the next day.

The couple have five children, three sons and twin daughters, ranging in age from 12 to 23.
