Death: Tiya Chauhan was 22 months old when she stopped breathing during a play session at a nursery

A 22-month-old girl choked to death on a raw jelly cube during a 'free-flow' play session at a nursery, an inquest has been told.

Tiya Chauhan fell unconscious and 
stopped breathing after being allowed to crawl freely between three rooms at the Dicky Birds nursery in Wimbledon, south London.

Yesterday her father Chetan Chauhan, 37, wept as he told an inquest his daughter was 'smiling and happy' on the last day he saw her alive.

Mr Chauhan, an IT worker, told an inquest jury at London's Royal Courts of Justice his daughter was a ‘character’ who was ‘already forming her own personality’.

She had loved going to nursery and was ‘smiling and happy’ on the day he dropped her off for the last time, he said.

‘It was a Wednesday, she was well,’ he said. ‘She was a perfectly happy child. She was smiling and quite happy that day, everything was fine.’

Staff at the nursery, a family-owned business with nurseries in Wimbledon, Raynes Park, New Malden and Surbiton in London, dialled 999 after the incident on the morning of August 23, 2012.

The inquest heard paramedics found Tiya not breathing and removed a piece of ‘jelly-like substance’ from her airway.

She was taken by ambulance to St George’s Hospital, Tooting, but died later the same day.

Mr Chauhan's wife Dipta, 36, wept in the public gallery as he told the jury about their young daughter and showed a picture of her weeks before her death.

‘Tiya was a character,’ Mr Chauhan said. ‘I remember her at home playing with her brother with their toys.

‘She was loud. She was forming her personality, she would pull her brother off her toys and push him away, but she was quite affectionate with her brother and with us.

‘Tiya was loved by everybody. She was an infectious child. She would go up to anybody, she wasn’t afraid of anything.’

Mr
 and Mrs Chauhan, who have been married 11 years and have three other 
children, did careful research before choosing a nursery for Tiya and 
her older brother, the inquest heard.

The couple, who live nearby, were happy with the care when Tiya started at Dicky Birds two days a week in October 2011, Mr Chauhan said.

But he was dismayed when he collected his tiny daughter from day care one afternoon with teeth marks on her cheek in January 2012, and she was bitten again in February.

He said: ‘At the time my wife felt maybe she should take Tiya out of nursery.’

Recalling the fatal incident, nursery room leader Ashleigh Brooks told the inquest jelly had been used as a sensory play activity at the nursery 'for years' but that it was 'hardly ever out'. 

'We either had cubes put out so it's sticky, touchy-feely sort of thing or melted,' she said. 'It's always in the cupboard.'

'The jelly was in a water tray and Tiya was standing there with another little girl... They were both playing and I sort of waved and gave them a big smile. They were playing like there wasn't a problem'

- Staff member Deborah Maloney

She
 said that there had been 'a few issues' during 'free flow play' in the 
past because it was harder to supervise the children. 

'Some days it did work but other times it was used a little too much,' Ms Brooks said. 

But she added the children 'really loved the chance to explore' and play with different activities. 

Moments before the incident, said staff member Deborah Maloney: 'The jelly was in a water tray and Tiya was standing there with another little girl... They were both playing and I sort of waved and gave them a big smile. 

'They were playing like there wasn't a problem.'

Nursery 
practitioner Olivia Aling found the toddler lying face down on the 
ground and carried out first aid with deputy manager Carna Poci, she 
said. 

'I saw Tiya lying face down on the floor with her head to one side,' Ms Aling said. 'I noticed she had blood and foam around her mouth and a small amount of blood on the floor around her mouth. 

'I went straight over and picked her up off the floor. I rolled her towards me so that her head was in my elbow. Carna took her from me and we called her name but no response.'

'I held Tiya's head while Carna started CPR. The ambulance service was directing us as to what to do. I held Tiya's head while she did breaths and compressions on her chest.'

The inquest continues today.
