The safety of one of the most popular forms of IVF has been called into question after a study showed it doubled the risk of birth defects.

Researchers found that one in ten babies born through ICSI suffered some form of abnormality. This compares with just over one in 20 of those conceived naturally.

But what experts don’t know yet is whether the problems are caused by the treatment, or the fact couples having it are at higher risk of defects anyway.

Crucial moment: A single sperm is injected directly into an egg in ICSI treatment

ICSI – or intracytoplasmic sperm injection – is used to treat male infertility. It involves injecting a sperm directly into an egg with a fine glass needle.

More than 23,000 procedures were performed last year and it represents just over half of all IVF treatments

It can help couples who were previously unable to conceive because the man’s sperm count was low or they were of too poor quality to swim up to the egg.

In this latest study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the University of Adelaide in Australia looked at more than 300,000 births.

They found that babies born via ICSI were 57 per cent more likely to suffer some form of abnormality.

Questions and answers on IVF

These ranged from serious defects of the heart and digestive system to relatively minor abnormalities such as club feet that could be fixed with surgery.

Overall 9.9 per cent of babies born through ICSI had a defect compared with 5.8 per cent of those born naturally. By contrast, standard IVF – where semen containing thousands of sperm is placed in a dish with eggs – was found to be no more risky than natural conception, once the couple’s age and other factors had been accounted for.

Experts are unsure whether it is the treatment causing the defects or the poor quality sperm of the men.

Lead author Professor Michael Davies, from the University of Adelaide, said: ‘We know from the study that standard IVF is safe. But we also now know that with ICSI, the risk is sky high.’ He pointed out that the technique involved implanting faulty sperm into an egg – in nature these would be weeded out.

Dr Allan Pacey, fertility expert at the University of Sheffield and chairman of the British Fertility Society, said: ‘An important point to make is that we know that babies conceived naturally to couples previously diagnosed with infertility are also  at slightly higher risk, which suggests that it may be something to do with the “infertility” rather than the “technology” used to conceive them.

‘It should be stressed that the vast majority of babies born  are healthy and the actual risks of any problems being detected are small.’

And Professor Peter Illingworth, of the University of Sydney, said: ‘It may well be that the sort of families who have to use ICSI have extreme sperm damage, and this may be the explanation as to why there is a higher rate of congenital abnormalities.’

Only two years ago the inventor of ICSI, André van Steirteghem, warned it was being overused. Professor Steirteghem – who invented it in Belgium in 1991 – told a conference that it should only be used as a last resort as it may cause problems in children.

Since the news of this study broke a number of women have contacted the Mail to say they have used the technique and had perfectly healthy babies. Campaigners urged couples to speak to their doctors if they were concerned.

Clare Lewis-Jones, of leading patient charity, Infertility Network UK, said: ‘IVF and ICSI bring joy to tens of thousands of people every year – last year there were around 60,000 cycles of IVF in the UK and without this many couples would never experience the joy of having a child of their own.

‘If patients are concerned by this research, I would recommend they speak directly to their clinician who will be able to discuss their individual situation.’

CASE STUDY

Katy and David Shiers used ICSI to have their daughter Grace after spending four years trying to conceive naturally.

Mrs Shiers, 27, had been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, which can lead to problems in becoming pregnant. Her 26-year-old husband had arthritis and his treatment could have affected his own fertility.

After one round of IVF failed, the couple, from Waterlooville, Hampshire, were offered ICSI by the Wessex Fertility clinic in Southampton.

Research plea: David and Katy Shiers with daughter Grace as a baby

Grace, now three, developed a brain cyst and kidney problems and was born at only 26 weeks.

Mrs Shiers, who looks after Grace full-time, said: ‘When Grace was in the neonatal intensive care ward, I would say about 80 per cent of the other babies there had been conceived using fertility treatment.

‘At least two were definitely from ICSI. There may well be something in that.

‘I obviously don’t know whether Grace’s problems are related to ICSI. But I would have been happier if someone had spelled out the risks. I don’t remember that happening at the time.

‘When you’re so desperate to have a family, as we were, someone could tell you it would be born with three heads and you wouldn’t care.

‘If someone said, “There is a low risk your child could be disabled”, I’d see that as a high chance the baby would be fine.

‘Having said that, I would 100 per cent back any move to issue parents doing this with more warnings about what the problems could be to avoid the shock we had.

‘There needs to be so much more research.’
