Natasha Harris downed up to 10 litres of Coke every day and would go 'crazy' without it

A mother-of-eight, 30, died suddenly from a cardiac arrest because she drank up to 18 pints of Coke every day for years, a coroner has ruled.

Natasha Harris died on February 25, 2010, after her partner Christopher Hodgkinson found her seated on the 
toilet, slumped against the wall and gasping for air at their home in Invercargill on New Zealand's south island.

An inquest last year revealed that she would drink at least four 2.5litre bottles of the fizzy drink each day, consuming more than twice the recommended daily 
caffeine consumption and more than 11 times the recommended sugar 
intake.

New Zealand coroner David Crerar said today that Ms 
Harris would not have died if it wasn’t for her dependence on Coke.

'I
found that, when all of the available evidence is considered, were it 
not for the consumption of very large quantities of Coke by Natasha 
Harris, it is unlikely that she would have died when she died and how 
she died,' reported the Bussleton-Dunsborough Mail.

The coroner's report revealed Ms Harris suffered from a myriad of medical conditions, including a racing heart and 'absent teeth', which her family say was caused from Coke consumption.

Natasha Marie Harris was said to go 'crazy' if she ran out of the fizzy drink which she guzzled by the bottle.

Mr Hodgkinson said she had been unwell leading up to her death and had no energy, but the idea Coca-Cola caused the problem had never crossed their minds. 

Mr Hodgkinson told the court that she had been unwell up to a year before her death, including vomiting six times a week, but they believed it was caused by the stress of looking after her eight children and gynecological problems.

'She drank at least 10 litres a day,' he said. 'As a family we wouldbuy four 2.5 litres a day, the maximum on special.

'The Coke would be for Natasha to consume over the course of the day.

'The first thing she would do in the morning was have a drink of Coke andthe last thing she would do in the day was have a drink of Coke by her bed.'

Police who investigated the death, which happened on February 25, 2010, estimated she consumed, on average, seven litres a day. 

A spokesman for Coca-Cola said: 'We are disappointed that the Coroner 
has chosen to focus on the combination of Ms Harris' excessive 
consumption of Coca-Cola, together with other health and lifestyle 
factors, as the probable cause of her death'

Her partner said she was addicted to Coke and without it she would get moody, irritable and be low 

'I didn't ever think about the Coke. I never considered it would do any harm to a person. It's just a soft drink, just like drinking water. I didn't think a drink's going to kill you,' he said.

She had been drinking a lot of Coca-Cola over the past seven or eight years,' he said.

Vivien Hodgkinson, Mr Hodgkinson's mother, said she would go 'crazy' if she ran out of the drink.

Ms Harris is estimated to have drunk up to 50,000 pints of Coca-Cola before she died

An autopsy showed Miss Harris had a diseased liver.Medical evidence stated that the main finding of death was from a cardiac arrhythmia.

Dr Dan Mornin told the court Miss Harris probably had severe hypokalemia, a lack of potassium in the blood, relating to excessive consumption of soft-drink.

He said although it was difficult to confirm this from postmortem tests, it was consistent with her symptoms of tiredness and lack of strength and other cases of heavy soft-drink consumers.

He added it was likely the vomiting was due to too much caffeine, medically known as caffeine toxicity.

Coca-Cola confirmed it had hired a security firm to shadow its staff, after Mr Hodgkinson allegedly made death threats against the company before she died.

He rejected claims he had made the threats, but said he held the company responsible for Harris' death.

Coca-Cola's New Zealand managing director George Adams said at the time of her death that Hodgkinson's claims were 'patently untrue'.

Coca Cola's latest statement said: 'The Coroner acknowledged 
that he could not be certain what caused Ms Harris' heart attack.

'Therefore we are disappointed that the Coroner has chosen to focus on 
the combination of Ms Harris’ excessive consumption of Coca-Cola, 
together with other health and lifestyle factors, as the probable cause 
of her death.

'This is contrary to the evidence that showed the experts 
could not agree on the most likely cause'.
