Amy Duggar, the 27-year-old niece of Jim Bob Duggar, has confirmed rumors that she was born out of wedlock - a sin in the eyes of her ultra-religious family, the stars of TLC's 19 Kids and Counting.

Jim Bob's sister Deanna, now 52, had Amy with her now-husband Terry, also 52, when they were 25 years old, but they didn't get married until 2006, 18 years after Amy's birth.

'The tabloids are telling the truth, my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock,' Amy wrote in a lengthy post on Instagram on Tuesday, along with a photo of her with her parents. 'I'm sure [my mom] was scared, young, ridiculed, and felt ashamed.'

Outspoken: Amy, pictured in 2012, wrote a lengthy confession on Instagram which accompanied a snap of her with her parents (previous photo) - confirming 'my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock'

Amy, an aspiring country singer, wrote: 'Just because we are Christians doesn't make us perfect, it just makes us forgiven. Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect!

'God knew my uncle would have a hit show and that somehow I would be part of it. He knew my parents story would be told.'

Amy also remarked that 'everyone sins differently' but that 'Jesus paid for it all'.

She then gushed over her parents, saying: 'I'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life', and, 'I'm also grateful that I have such an awesome relationship with my dad! Seriously he's the greatest!'

Dad: Amy also wrote, 'I'm also grateful that I have such an awesome relationship with my dad!' Pictured, a snap she posted to Instagram yesterday, captioned, 'Happy birthday to my Daddio! Who I love very much!'

When the news was initially broken last week by Radar Online, there was speculation that Terry might not be Amy's biological father, since Terry said in a 2012 interview that he and Deanna had been dating for 20 years, which would have been five years after Amy was born. 

It seems, however, that this was simply a miscalculation on Terry's part. 

In a 2009 interview on 19 Kids and Counting, Deanna said: 'Terry and I knew each other a long time ago, and I got pregnant with Amy. And so, we dated each other on and off for quite some time. 

'Then we finally decided you know what, we need to get married! So we got married, we’ve been together three years.'

Getting it off her chest: In the post (pictured), Amy insists, 'Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect!'

Forgiven: Jim Bob (left) is against even hugging before marriage, but is still close with his sister Deanna and niece Amy, who shared this FaceTime session (right) with cousin Josie, five, on Instagram only yesterday

Shunned: Jill (left), a practicing midwife, was apparently forbidden by her parents from helping Susanna Keller (right) - the youngest sister of Anna Duggar - when she became pregnant outside of wedlock in 2012

While all that may seem against the Duggar family principles, Jim Bob still very much loves his sister and says they spend time together every week.

'The tabloids are telling the truth, my mom and dad did have me out of wedlock. 

Just because we are Christians doesn't make us perfect, it just makes us forgiven. 

Just because I share the Duggar name doesn't mean my life is perfect! 

God knew my uncle would have a hit show and that somehow I would be part of it. 

He knew my parents' story would be told. How amazing is that?! Your testimony is everything. 

Everyone struggles, and sins differently. But Jesus paid it all!! I'm extremely grateful to my mom for choosing to give me life. 

I'm sure she was scared, young, ridiculed, and felt ashamed. God's grace covered it though! She's beautiful inside and out. 

I'm also grateful that I have such an awesome relationship with my dad! Seriously he's the greatest!

Jesus, thank you for restoring hearts, relationships and families. 

No matter what you have done, don't think your a second you're alone in this world. 

Jesus died so that you may be free! John3:16'

Indeed, only yesterday Amy posted a snap of herself chatting with her five-year-old cousin Josie, Jim Bob and Michelle's youngest child, on FaceTime.

'Face timing the family tonight! #allsmiles @duggarfam', she captioned the image. 

Amy's confession comes hot on the heels on rumors that Jim Bob and Michelle once banned their midwife daughter Jill from helping a member of their extended family, because she too got pregnant out of wedlock.

This allegation concerns Susanna Keller, the 22-year-old younger sister of Anna Duggar, 23, who is married to Jim Bob and Michelle's oldest son Josh. 

When Susanna give birth to her first child two years ago, Jill was apparently forbidden from helping by her strict parents because they didn't want her fraternizing with an unwed mother-to-be.

'Jill was very excited to assist Susanna through the birth,' a source told Radar.

'Michelle and Jim Bob, however, wouldn't let her participate. They thought Jill shouldn't be exposed to an unmarried mother in that condition.'

The Duggars are well known for following a hardline Christian sect known as the Quiverfull movement, which promotes procreation and eschews all forms of birth control. 

Another recent scandal involves the recent revelation that Michelle has a sister who is a lesbian.

Michelle has never said much of the woman, Evelyn Ruark, who did appear in an early episode of the show without her partner, but her sister has called their lifestyle a cult.

We are worried about them,’ Evelyn's partner Sharon Callahan told The National Enquirer in 2010.

‘We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.’
