Violent clashes broke out in several Greek cities last night after an anti-fascist activist and musician was stabbed to death by a man claiming to be a member of far-right Golden Dawn party.

Pavlos Fyssas, 34, a hip-hop singer whose stage 
name was Killah P, died in a state hospital in the early hours of Wednesday morning after being 
stabbed twice outside a cafe in the Keratsini area west of Athens. 

Yesterday, a 45-year-old man was arrested 
at the scene. He admitted attacking Fyssas and said he belonged to Golden
 Dawn. A knife with traces of blood was found near his car.

Golden Dawn leader Nicholas Michaloliakos says the group had nothing to do with the attack.

Clashes broke out on Wednesday evening in Keratsini and five other cities between riot police and thousands of protesters holding anti-fascist 
demonstrations in Fyssas' memory.

In Keratsini, violence broke out near the scene of the stabbing, with hundreds of protesters attacking a nearby police station.

The
 confrontation lasted more than two hours, with riot police using tear 
gas to repel youths, who set fire to trash bins and smashed up sidewalks
 with hammers to throw rocks at police.

The 
clashes left a busy suburban road strewn with rocks and smoldering trash
 for several hundred meters.

Traffic outside the busy port of 
Piraeus was disrupted as police cordoned off streets to stop protesters 
from reaching the area.

Similar
 scenes played out in Thessaloniki, Greece's second-largest city, where 
about 6,000 demonstrators marched.

Greek media also reported violent 
clashes in the western city of Patras, the northeastern city of Xanthi, 
the central city of Larissa and in Chania on the southern island of 
Crete.

Authorities said at least 75 people were detained - 41  in Keratsini and 36 in Thessaloniki.

Earlier,
 friends of the victim and residents left flowers and candles at the 
spot of the attack, where blood still stained the sidewalk.

The head of a
 small right-wing opposition party, Panos Kamenos of the Independent 
Greeks, was briefly assaulted by protesters when he attempted to visit 
the site.

Deputy Prime
 Minister Evangelos Venizelos, whose Socialist party is part of the 
coalition government, said Golden Dawn had 'violence as its priority and
 must be dealt with as a criminal organization.'

Hannes
 Swoboda, president of the Socialists and Democrats Group in the 
European Parliament, urged Greek authorities to examine banning the 
party altogether.

He said: 'Golden
 Dawn's openly xenophobic, neo-Nazi hatred even goes as far as murdering
 political opponents. This is shocking and intolerable by any standards,
 and more so in a European Union country.'

The rights group Amnesty International called on authorities to prevent any further incidents.

Jezerca 
Tigani, Amnesty's deputy Europe and Central Asia program director said: 'Politically
 motivated violence of this kind is unacceptable anywhere, and history 
has shown the grim consequences if it goes unchecked.

'The 
Greek authorities must send a clear message that attacks like this will 
not be tolerated.'

The
 suspect, who was not named in accordance with Greek law, appeared 
before a prosecutor Wednesday evening along with his wife, who was also 
arrested on suspicion of concealing evidence.

Another couple also 
appeared in court on similar charges. Five prosecutors have been 
assigned to the case.

Golden
 Dawn, whose senior members have expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler 
although they deny being neo-Nazi, won nearly 7 percent of the vote in 
2012 general elections. Recent opinion polls show its support has since 
risen to around 12 percent. 

Party
 members and supporters, often clearly identifiable in black T-shirts 
and combat pants, have been suspected of beatings and stabbings across 
the country, usually of dark-skinned migrants.

In January, two men 
identified as party sympathizers were arrested for the fatal stabbing of
 a Pakistani migrant worker. 

Golden Dawn 
has been blamed for numerous violent attacks in the past. However, the 
stabbing of the young musician is the most serious violence so far, and 
the first directly attributed to a 
member.

Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias said: 'I
 am shaken by the event. [the attacks] show in the clearest possible way the 
intentions of the neo-Nazi creation.'

Michaloliakos,
 the Golden Dawn head, said his party 'unreservedly condemns the murder 
of the 34-year-old at Keratsini and denies any involvement of the 
party.'

He added: 'All the 
political parties must assume their responsibilities and not create a 
climate of civil war, giving a political character to a tragic event.'

Police 
spokesman Christos Parthenis said the suspect drove to the scene of an 
altercation between two groups of people, got out of the car and stabbed
 Fyssas.

Friends of the victim told Greek media they had been attacked 
by a large group of men as they left the cafe.

Golden
 Dawn lawmaker Michalis Avranitis offered a different version of events,
 saying the victim and the suspect had initially argued about a soccer 
match.

Avranitis said in Parliament: 'Yes, this man, as it turns out, has declared himself to be a member of Golden Dawn. But Golden Dawn has 1 million supporters.

'If, in a restaurant, two drunken idiots have a fight and someone is stabbed, should we look at their ideology and blame that'.
