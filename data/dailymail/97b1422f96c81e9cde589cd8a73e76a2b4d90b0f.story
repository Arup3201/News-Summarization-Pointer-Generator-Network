From visiting the Oklahoma towns devastated by tornadoes to a Mother's Day tea with Prince Harry, the President and First Lady have had another busy month.

Photos of the White House engagements for May have just been released, showing Barack and Michelle Obama as they work on campaigns close to their heart.

Towards the end of May, the First Lady was joined by students as she worked in her kitchen garden.

New Jersey children who had helped plant the garden in April returned to the White House to pick the fresh vegetables, which were then served as topping on a healthy pizza.

The President also spent time with the communities in New Jersey who were affected by Super Storm Sandy in November.

After months of hard work, the boardwalks, beaches and businesses ruined by the storm are ready to start welcoming summer visitors.

'You are stronger than the storm. After 
all you’ve dealt with, after all you’ve been through, the Jersey Shore 
is back and it is open for business,' the President said.

'If anybody wondered whether the Shore could ever be all right again, you got your answer this weekend.'

The President also visited families struggling to cope after a series of devastating tornandoes hit the Oklahoma town of Moore, killing 24 people, including several children.

He visited the site of the Plaza Towers Elementary School, where students trying to shelter from the storm died, and comforted residents.

As schools across the nation started to hold their graduations, the President and his wife visited schools to speak to students about the importance of education.

The First Lady was also joined by Dr Jill Biden and Prince Harry at the White Hose for a Mother's Day tea to honor military mothers and the sacrifices their families make.

As children attending the event made gifts for their mothers in the State Dining Room, they were joined by Prince Harry, who has served in Afghanistan in the British Army.
