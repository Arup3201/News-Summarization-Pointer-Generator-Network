Jason Roy suffered an injury on Sunday but should still be fit to inject some dynamism into the top of England’s order for the one-off Twenty20 international at Edgbaston that will complete India’s up-and-down tour.

It looked as if the hard-hitting batsman’s international debut would be delayed when Roy had to retire hurt after being struck on the right thumb by Hamish Bennett during Surrey’s match against New Zealand A.

Yet an X-ray revealed only bruising and Roy should be ready to play next Sunday. And with England batting so badly thus far in the Royal London one-day series, that match may yet prove to be an audition for a late World Cup call-up. 

Scare: Jason Roy has been in superb form for Surrey during this year's Natwest T20 blast

And... relax: Jason Roy posted a message on Twitter to assure fans he would be fit for his England debut

Eoin Morgan (captain), Moeen Ali, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Jos Buttler (wkt), Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Joe Root, Jason Roy , James Taylor, James Tredwell, Chris Woakes. 

Roy explained: ‘I tried to bat on after I got hit but then got a bit worried and shot off to get an X-ray for my peace of mind. Everything was fine and it should be fully healed in a couple of days.

‘It’s been a dream to play for England since I was a pup. This is a huge opportunity for me and I’m very excited.’

Those who believe England’s 50-over squad lacks flair will welcome a Twenty20 party which also includes James Taylor, the most unlucky of current players not to play more for England, and the recalled Ravi Bopara. 

There was also a surprise call for Tim Bresnan, whose England days seemed to be over after World Twenty20 defeat by Bangladesh. His participation is in doubt, however, as he played no part in yesterday’s Roses match after suffering a chest injury.

It is Roy’s selection, though, that will draw most attention with England’s inability to post big limited-overs scores becoming acute, as demonstrated in their latest crushing defeat at Trent Bridge on Saturday.  

Dynamic: The opener blasted 677 runs in the competition, earning him a first call-up to the England squad

Return: James Taylor's excellent limited overs form has earned him a place back in the England reckoning

There is no question that Roy, top scorer in this year’s NatWest Twenty20 Blast with 677 runs at a strike-rate of 157, can score quickly and aggressively. The question is whether his technique will stand up to the highest scrutiny.

Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, said that Roy, 24, hits the ball ‘harder than anyone I’ve played with or seen’ as he showed when striking five sixes in an over for England Lions this season.

‘It’s not brute strength that creates the power because it’s the same when he strikes a rugby ball or football,’ said Stewart, England’s most capped player. ‘It’s timing. I’ve seen him stun a ball for six. He doesn’t follow through, he checks it.’

Those who worry about England’s identity will note that Roy was born overseas, but he learnt his cricket at Surrey after emigrating with his parents from Durban to England when he was nine. 

Firepower: Ravi Bopara's big hitting, clever shotmaking and canny bowling is useful in T20 cricket

Roy’s path to the top has not always been smooth but he has settled down under the guidance of Surrey coach Graham Ford.

England will be captained by Eoin Morgan in the absence of Stuart Broad, who has an operation on his right knee on Wednesday that will rule him out until the triangular series against Australia and India that precedes the World Cup.

Morgan, among the best limited-overs batsmen in the world, has been one of the biggest disappointments in England’s woeful 50-over cricket that sees them 2-0 down against India after Saturday’s six-wicket defeat with just tomorrow’s match and Friday’s at Headingley to come.
