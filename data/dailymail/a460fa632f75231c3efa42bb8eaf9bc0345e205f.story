A mother was horrified after recently discovering that a photo she posted on Facebook of her 2-year-old daughter had been used to create cruel memes which poked fun at the sick child.

Little Mariah Anderson of Summerville, South Carolina, was born with Chromosome Two Duplication Syndrome, a rare genetic condition that impairs both her learning and motor skills.

Mom Kyra Pringle had shared a photo of Mariah celebrating her second birthday last month, but internet trolls quickly turned it into memes which made fun of young girl's picture.

Little Mariah Anderson of Summerville, South Carolina, was born with Chromosome Two Duplication Syndrome, a rare genetic condition that impairs both her learning and motor skills. Mom Kyra posted the picture on the right to celebrate her daughter's birthday last month

One meme featured the photo of Mariah plus the wording 'someone shows you their baby and she looks like this - what do you so.'

'She's not a monster,' Pringle told News 2 on Saturday. 'She's not fake. She's real. She is here.' 

'This is actually a human being, this is a child, this is a baby,' added Mariah's grandmother Linda Pringle.  

However once people realized that the brave young girl was real and suffering from a condition that has drastically shortened her life expectancy, the negative turned into a positive as some of the strangers said they were sorry. 

'One guy was like I was one of them to share this and laugh because I thought she wasn't real' said Pringle, 'he said I do apologize - if I were you I wouldn't accept my apology.' 

Pringle told News 2 that she has now received many more positive comments than the original negatives ones 

Ignoring the bad online and focusing on all the love she is receiving in messages. 'All I can say is thank you,' she said.  

There is no cure for her Mariah's condition, but the brave young girl is already living longer than doctors expected.

The family are heading to North Carolina in March for treatment and observation and are continuing to raise funds to pay for Mariah's medical expenses via her GoFundMe page.
