A rescue helicopter has captured amazing footage as it pulled a cruise passenger to safety off the coast of Miami.

The young man aboard a Norwegian Cruise Lines ship choked on a piece of meat and at one point was reported to have stopped breathing.

The daring rescue sees a helicopter hover over the vessel and lower a stretcher before loading the passenger onto it and winching him to safety. 

A young man aboard a Norwegian cruise ship had to be rescue airlifted out after choking on a piece of meat

The feat was just an average day for Miami-Dade Fire Rescue, which captured the entire scene on a GoPro camera attached to the helicopter.

As the rescue helicopter approaches the massive ship – distinguishable by the large happy face on its front bow – the fire brigade begins to lower ropes toward their ‘reference points’ below.

Fast forward and the man is being airlifted out on a stretcher, while the flight medic holds onto the side of the bed to secure.

At about 20 seconds in, the manoeuvre seems to be a success.

Rescue workers were unable to organise a ship-to-ship transfer, so the helicopter was called in

A flight medic was lowered down onto the gigantic ship to secure the man to a stretcher and lift him out

The man was transferred to a local hospital, though his current condition is unknown

‘We’re looking good,’ a voice says off camera. 

Once he reaches the interior of the helicopter, it quickly speeds away from the glowing lights of the massive cruise ship.

According to rescuers, attempts to transfer the passenger from the ship to a boat were unsuccessful, which is why the helicopter was brought in.

'The fire boat making its way out there felt that the seas were going to be too rough to do a ship-to-ship transfer of any patient,' Lt. Chris McCory of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue told CBS Miami.

The patient was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital. His current condition is unknown.
