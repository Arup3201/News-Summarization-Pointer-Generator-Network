Standing tall: Chloe Hooper, 12, broke her back in May but is now fully recovered

A paralysed girl  who broke her back when she fell nearly 20ft from a tree has astounded doctors with her recovery – thanks to titanium rods screwed  into her spine.

Chloe Hooper’s parents feared  she would never walk again after the accident at a Scout camp.

The fall shattered a bone in her back and left another pressing against her spine.

The injury was so serious that her spine would have collapsed if she had tried to stand up.

Chloe underwent a remarkable  90-minute procedure which is similar to one routinely offered to patients with scoliosis – an abnormal curvature of the back.

Princess Eugenie suffered from scoliosis  and had surgery lasting eight hours to correct it in 2002.

Chloe and Eugenie, who were  both treated at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) in Middlesex, ‘swapped notes’ when the 12-year-old schoolgirl was introduced to the Princess at a charity dinner six weeks after her operation.

Eugenie is patron of an  RNOH appeal to raise £15 million  to redevelop its site.

Chloe’s mother Julie, 45, from Rayleigh, Essex, reveals: ‘It was amazing meeting Princess Eugenie, who told us all about her operation. Chloe has been so brave through everything.

'We had feared the worst, so when we saw her walk again it was such an emotional moment.’

Chloe’s astonishing recovery gives hope to the 1,000 Britons a year paralysed by spinal cord injuries.

The spinal column is made up of vertebrae, and it relays messages from the brain around the body.

People can end up paralysed if the spinal cord is crushed and a patient doesn’t receive surgery promptly –for example if they’re left trapped for hours after an accident.

Fortunately, Chloe was in the operating theatre within hours of her fall in May.

When she fell, she was acting as ‘lookout’ for her friends who were enjoying a water fight below her.

The branch she was sitting on snapped suddenly, sending Chloe hurtling to the ground, and she landed on her back.

Julie and her husband Simon, 43,  a paramedic for the London Ambulance Service, rushed to the Scout camp, which was just minutes from their home.

Julie says: ‘Chloe was talking but complaining that her legs felt funny – she was getting shocks through her feet and her nerve endings felt on fire.

‘Simon did a quick assessment, then called an ambulance. I just keep telling myself, “As long as she’s alive.” ’

The youngster was taken to a local hospital before being referred to the RNOH for specialist treatment.

An MRI and CT scan confirmed that she had fractured one of the 12 vertebrae that make up the spine in the upper back and provide structure for the rib cage.

A section of bone was also pressing on the part of the spinal cord responsible for muscle and bladder control.

‘Chloe is incredibly lucky,’ says Robert Lee, a consultant spinal surgeon at the RNOH.

‘She broke the oval segment of bone that surrounds the spinal cord. It’s a bit like squashing a grape – bits fly out everywhere and if you tried to stand, your spine would collapse.

‘Patients who come in like this  can be paralysed straight away or develop paralysis afterwards.

'Chloe had only partial paralysis  but there was still a risk that she  could deteriorate.’

She was given a general anaesthetic, then very carefully rolled on to her front, a manoeuvre that involved six people to ensure no further damage to her spine.

Medics then rigged Chloe up to a special machine which checks that the nerves in the spinal cord are functioning normally during surgery.

Next, an incision was made down the middle of her back, before eight 12in titanium screws were positioned along the spine in pairs – one on each side – including where the bone was fractured.

They were screwed into the bone to support and strengthen the vertebrae. Mr Lee also inserted two 3.5in titanium rods vertically down either side of Chloe’s spine.

A screw was used to secure those rods in place at each point along the spine – doctors tightened them using a special wrench to correct the fracture.

The surgical team also took away a small portion of bone from the spine to reduce pressure on Chloe’s back.

The schoolgirl was walking the day after the operation with the  help of a physiotherapist, and discharged a week after surgery.

The rods and screws will remain in her back for life and she relies on friends to carry her school bag, but otherwise she has made a full recovery. To thank doctors, her family are now raising funds for the RNOH.

Her father Simon said: ‘We never dreamed Chloe would make a full recovery. One day she will walk down the church aisle or run in the school sports day.’
