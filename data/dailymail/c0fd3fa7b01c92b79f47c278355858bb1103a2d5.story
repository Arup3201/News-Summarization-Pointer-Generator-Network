DNA tests have confirmed that a girl 
mistakenly identified in New Zealand as missing youngster Madeleine 
McCann is not her.

Officers in England requested a DNA 
sample from the girl after there were reports that she could be 
Madeleine. But tests proved it was not her, New Zealand Police said.

Detective Inspector Steve McGregor 
said: 'We have received confirmation from Scotland Yard that a DNA 
sample provided voluntarily from a girl mistaken as missing British girl
 Madeleine McCann on New Year's Eve in Queenstown last year does not 
provide a match for that of the missing girl.

Confusion: DNA tests have proved that a girl in New Zealand, who is frequently mistaken for Madeline McCann is not the missing child

'At the time of the sighting police 
made thorough inquiries into the sighting and were completely satisfied 
that the girl was not Madeleine McCann.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman confirmed 
that following the DNA submission police were 'satisfied' that the girl 
identified in New Zealand was not Madeleine.

Police launched a five-day investigation in January when a Queenstown retailer became suspicious of a man and the young girl.

The 'sighting' on New Year's Eve was the second time the girl was mistaken for Madeleine last year, the other being in March.

Relentless: Kate and Gerry McCann have never given up their quest to track down their missing daughter

Madeleine was nearly four when 
she vanished from her family's Portuguese holiday apartment in Praia da 
Luz as her parents, Gerry and Kate, ate dinner at a nearby tapas 
restaurant with friends.

The
 case led to a worldwide search amidst fears the girl had been snatched,
 but despite a number of leads coming to light no trace of Madeleine has
 every been conclusively found.

Since
 the disappearance, officials have from time to time issued digitally 
altered images showing what she might look like over the passage of 
time.

Portuguese police 
stopped formally investigating the case in July 2008, but Madeleine's 
family have never given up their quest to track down their missing 
daughter.

Mrs McCann has ploughed £1million from sales of her book back into the search.

The bestseller, entitled simply Madeleine, was published in 2011 on the day of her eighth birthday.

Madeleine's Fund hit £1.8million shortly after the three-year-old vanished from her family’s holiday.

But by 2011, after four years of searching, it had dwindled to £125,000.

Official papers filed with Companies House show all the money raised from the 384-page book went to the fund.

The fund's directors said: 'Income from the book has significantly improved the position.'
