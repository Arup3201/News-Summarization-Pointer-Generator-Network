Mournfully but movingly, those bereaved by the River Thames Marchioness pleasure boat tragedy have remembered their loved ones at a cathedral service on the 25th anniversary of the disaster. 

Crowding round a flower-strewn, candle-lit memorial stone at Southwark Cathedral in south London, the families, and some survivors, heard the names read out of all 51 young people who died in the tragedy. 

It was on August 20, 1989, that the riverboat Marchioness, packed with partygoers, collided with the dredger Bowbelle and sank in the Thames in central London. 

Among those who died was Francesca Dallaglio, 19, the sister of former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio and merchant banker Antonio de Vasconcellos, whose 26th birthday was being celebrated aboard the boat.

The names of the dead had also been read out at a lunchtime Eucharist in the cathedral during which bereaved mother Judy Wellington, whose son Simon, 20, was lost on the Marchioness, gave a Bible reading.

The cathedral was adorned with 51 red roses and 51 candles were lit to honour each of the dead.

A launch was provided to allow families to drop flowers at the spot on the river where the accident happened.

Among those at the cathedral was Margaret Lockwood Croft, 75, who lost her son Shaun, 26, in the disaster.

She said today: 'Shaun is always in my thoughts. I have to hold on to all the memories - his laughter, his caring ways.

'He was born on the same day as me. He was the greatest birthday present I ever had.'

Through the Marchioness Action Group, Mrs Lockwood Croft spearheaded the campaign for improved Thames safety standards which eventually led to lifeboat services, and other safety features, being provided on the Thames.

Representatives of the Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) and the Port of London Authority were at today's service.

Damning: A report by Lord Justice Clarke in 2001 said it was 'a catastrophe that should never have happened'

The bereaved families had to endure a 10-year wait for the announcement of a public inquiry into the disaster following an earlier 1991 report from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB).

That first report said the failure of both vessels to mount a proper look-out was the immediate cause of the tragedy. This was the same conclusion reached by Lord Justice Clarke when his 2001 report was published after the public inquiry, announced in 1999, was finally held.

While the MAIB report said that there were marine regulation faults going back 25 years, the Clarke report said it was 'a catastrophe that should never have happened'.

In the years between the two inquiries the families had to absorb the news that the Bowbelle captain, Douglas Henderson, was formally acquitted after juries at two separate trials failed to reach verdicts on a charge of his failing to keep a proper look-out.

The families also had to come to terms with the decision by Westminster Coroner Dr Paul Knapman to cut off the hands of more than 20 of the Marchioness victims for identification purposes - an action criticised in the Clarke report.

The Clarke report was also critical of Captain Henderson, who had drunk six pints of lager in the afternoon before the tragedy. There was also criticism of the owners of both vessels.

An inquest jury into the disaster returned a verdict of 'unlawful killing'. In July 1996 the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to justify any further criminal proceedings.
