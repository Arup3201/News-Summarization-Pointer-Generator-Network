A Tibetan man died after setting himself alight in the latest self-immolation protest against Chinese rule over the Himalayan region yesterday.

The fatal protest occurred at a prominent Tibetan monastery in Gansu province, northwestern China a London-based rights group said.

This is the seventh self-immolation death as a result of pro-Tibet protests against China this month, Free Tibet said.

Deadly protest: The man's body on fire near a prayer hall at the remote Labrang Monastery in China's northwestern Gansu province

The protester, who has been identified as 50-year-old man named Dhondup, set fire to himself near the prayer hall at the remote Labrang Monastery on Monday morning.

The monastery is one of the most important outside of Tibet and was the site of numerous protests following deadly ethnic riots in Tibet in 2008.

Free Tibet said Monday's self-immolation was the first to take place at Labrang Monastery, and that there have been heavy restrictions in place in the area in recent months.Â 

Citing a witness, it said the monastery manager and other monks prevented police from taking Dhondup's body.

The official Xinhua News Agency quoted a 
provincial government official as saying a 63-year-old herdsman set 
himself ablaze at the monastery but did not
give the man's name or say whether he survived.

Self-immolation as a way of protesting against Beijing's heavy-handed rule in the region  has increased in the past 18 months, Free Tibet said.

A reported 56 Tibetans have set themselves alight in ethnic Tibetan areas of China since March 2011.

The Chinese government has confirmed some of the self-immolations.

The Dalai Lama and representatives of the self-declared Tibetan government-in-exile in India say they oppose all violence.

'Tibetan protests are escalating,' Free Tibet director Stephanie Brigden said in a statement.

'Dhondup is the eighth Tibetan in the last month alone who has risked his life to protest Chinese rule; seven of the eight have died.'

She said China's government could recognize that Tibetan demands for freedom cannot be extinguished by force and that it "must enter into meaningful dialogue with Tibetan representatives, supported by the international community.'

China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the 1950s.

Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high.

Angry and desperate Tibetans have taken to self-immolation in protest, a centuries-long tradition which has become a type of radical political protest.

More than 500 have been reported in Western media since the 1960s.

In March this year a Tibetan man self-immolated in New Delhi, India, to protest a visit by the Chinese president.

In May, one man died and another was seriously injured after they set themselves alight in China's Qinghai province, shouting pro-independence song and holding Tibetan flags.

The controversial method of protest is much debated among Tibetans themselves. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.
