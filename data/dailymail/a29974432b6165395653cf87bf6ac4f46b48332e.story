Accusations: Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude has been accused of overseeing a 'ludicrous waste of taxpayers' money'

The Cabinet minister in charge of slashing Whitehall waste has spent £8.5million doing up the headquarters of his own department.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude was last night accused of overseeing a ‘ludicrous waste of taxpayers’ money’ after details of the lavish refurbishment emerged.

Figures released by the Cabinet Office reveal the department – which is also used by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his staff – has spent £8.5million overhauling its Grade 1-listed Whitehall HQ since the election in 2010.

Officials last night claimed the refurbishment could save money in the long run as it would enable more civil servants to use the building.

But the revelations are embarrassing for Mr Maude who boasted this month that he was making huge strides in cutting Government waste.Labour last night seized on the figures.

Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: ‘Only last week Francis Maude claimed to possess an “unwavering determination to keep eradicating waste in Whitehall”.

‘If this is so, why is he spending  millions refurbishing a single building owned by his department?

Anger: PCS union boss Mark Serwotka, who is locked in a dispute with Mr Maude about reforms to public sector pensions, said 'people will wonder exactly what Francis Maude's priorities are'

‘This is more evidence of the vast gap between the Government’s rhetoric and the reality of its policies.

‘This Government is not serious about efficiency which would protect necessary frontline services. This is a ludicrous waste of taxpayers’ money.’

PCS union boss Mark Serwotka, who is locked in a dispute with Mr Maude about reforms to public- sector pensions, said: ‘With thousands of civil servants losing their jobs and many more under threat, people will wonder exactly what Francis Maude’s priorities are.’

Some of the costs went towards making the building greener by installing insulation, light sensors and secondary glazing, as well as improving disabled access.

Sources said providing accommodation for Nick Clegg and his staff did not add significantly to the bill.

A Government insider accused Labour of ‘breathtaking hypocrisy’ over the issue, pointing out that the refurbishment had been planned by the last government.

He denied ministers were enjoying ‘lavish’ accommodation as a result of the overhaul, describing the refurbishment as ‘modern but austere’.

A Cabinet Office spokesman claimed the refurbishment would provide desk space for more civil servants, allowing the Government to release other buildings.

He added: ‘Our plan to reduce the locations staff are based in will save the taxpayer at least £100million.

‘By investing money up front in modernising our historic office at 70 Whitehall, we can quickly start moving people out of other buildings and save money faster.’

Earlier this month Mr Maude boasted of cutting the Whitehall headcount to its lowest since the Second World War.

But it emerged that many staff remain on the public payroll and have simply been transferred to quangos and other agencies.
