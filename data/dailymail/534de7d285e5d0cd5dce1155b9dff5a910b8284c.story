With Valentine's Day just around the corner it's the time of year when love is in the air but as these pictures prove - it's all over the earth too.

These extraordinary images, taken by photographers across the globe, show Mother Nature is also gearing up to celebrate the big day with iconic heart shapes appearing all over the natural world.

The charming pictures capture Mother Nature's romantic side and feature several signs of love including an adorable fluffy penguin with a white heart emblazoned on its chest.

Other natural displays include a flamingo creating a heart shape with its white and pink plumage and two swans which appear to kiss as they form a heart shape with their necks.

Elsewhere a swarm of bees form an iconic heart as they hang from a tree and two mating dragonflies also form the universal sign for love.

It's not just the animal kingdom getting romantic though, a yellow tulip flower is pictured with red hearts on its petals and a bright red heart-shaped Red Anthurium flower can also be seen.

Meanwhile mysterious heart-shaped holes have also been spotted in tree trunks and rock formations around the world.
