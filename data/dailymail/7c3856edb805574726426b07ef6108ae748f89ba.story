She has been known as 'the other girl' or even the 'lucky one' but four years after being attacked with a baseball bat in Chicago, Stacy Jurich still bears emotional scars.

In April 2010 she had her friend Natasha McShane had been walking home after a night out when a man savagely beat them as they passed under a viaduct.

Miss Jurich needed more than 15 stitches in the back of her head, lost some of her vision and suffers from tremors. Her 23-year-old friend, Miss McShane, was left unable to walk or talk.

Victim: Northern Irish graduate Natasha McShane was left seriously disabled after the attack

Their attacker stole the girls' purses and Miss Jurich remembers thinking that no one would know who they were, just before she lost consciousness.

Miss Jurich told the Chicago Tribune that it was while she was still in hospital that she realized she was the only one who could help bring their attacked to justice.

A few days after the attack, detectives visited her in hospital and asked her to identify items they had found. It was perfume and make up the friends had bought the day before the attack.

The sight of their belongings reduced Miss Jurich to tears, but she told the Chicago Tribune it made her think: 'This is on your plate now. You are the only voice.'

For the 
past four years Ms Jurich has worked tirelessly with police to ensure 
their attacker, Heriberto Viramontes, would be brought to justice.

He
 is due to be sentenced next week, after being found guilt in October of
 attempted murder, armed robbery and aggravated robber.

Painful memories: Stacy stands close to where she and Natasha were attacked. Four years after their ordeal she can still recall seeing her friend being smashed to the ground

Guilty: Heriberto Viramontes was convicted of attempted murder last year. Marcy Cruz, right, was also jailed for 22 years for driving Viramontes away after he attacked and robbed two young women

Marcy Cruz, who drove him away from the crime scene, has already been sentenced to 22 years in prison.

When she faced Viramontes at the trial last year, Miss Jurich, 28, told the court: I had to be the voice because I didn't want this man to hurt anyone else. I wanted to put [Viramontes] away for my best friend, for Natasha.'

With an end to the trial in sight, Miss Jurich is starting to feel strong enough to talk about her ordeal.

The granddaughter of a police sergeant, who lives in Chicago with her fiance Tim Shannon, is still reduced to tears when she thinks about the attack and its aftermath.

She kept cuttings of news articles about her and her friend, and has an assortment of gifts sent by the city's Irish community while she was recovering.

But she has only returned twice to the crime scene, where their attacker had rushed up behind the girls at about 3am, striking Miss Jurich before smashing Miss McShane to the ground.

Her most recent visit was during an interview with the Chicago Tribune, as she gave a rare interview about the impact the attack had on her life.Â 

For the past four years, she told the 
paper, she had been known as 'the other girl,' because Miss McShane's 
injuries had been so physically devastating.

But Miss Jurich was also seriously injured, and left unable to work after the attack. She has lost part of her vision and suffered seizures.

'When you look at her from the outside, people might think she's fine, that she is this beautiful young girl. But she still has seizures. She has trouble with peripheral vision. She still has nightmares,' her aunt, Tammy Alfaro, told the Tribune.

'That stuff never went away for her,' she added.

Miss Jurich, 28, can vividly recall seeing her friend, a Northern Irish graduate who had been studying in the city, crashing to the ground as Viramontes hit her.

'She went 
down immediately. She just lifelessly fell into the sidewalk,' Ms Jurich
 told a court at their attacker's trial last year.

The
 pair had been having a 'fantastic evening' Miss Jurich said. But the 
attack changed both of their lives, and left Miss McShane needing 
round-the-clock care.

Miss Jurich told the Tribune that when she finally regained consciousness in hospital two days after their attack, she couldn't shake the horror she had seen.

'I said, "No, no, no" because I still remembered. I saw her on that ground. I saw her, and there was blood everywhere. It wasn't just my blood. I said, "Where is she?".

Healing: Four years after the attack Stacy, pictured with her fiance Tim Shannon, is getting her life back on track

Life changing: The events of that April night in 2010 have shaped Stacy and Natasha's life forever

On the night she was left disabled for life, Miss McShane had just been offered an internship that would have allowed her to extend her visa in the U.S.

Instead, her family flew her back to Northern Ireland, where she struggles to accomplish even the smallest of tasks, like drinking from a cup.

Miss Jurich says she is haunted by feelings of guilt. When she got engaged, and got a job she felt sad knowing her friend would never share those experiences.

To pay tribute to her friend, and as a reminder of the attack that changed both of their lives forever, Miss Jurich designed a tattoo, featuring two roses to represent the friends, and an Irish cross to represent Miss McShane's home country.

Miss Jurich still Skypes Miss McShane and says she would like to visit her. 'I just want to just see her, and to let her know that I didn't give up the fight,' she said.
