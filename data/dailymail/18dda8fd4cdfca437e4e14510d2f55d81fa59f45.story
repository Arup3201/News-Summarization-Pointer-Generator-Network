One thing the internet has shown us,  it is that few people can resist looking at images of cute
animals.

Now new research has revealed that looking at cute images of
baby animals doesn’t just make you feel warm and fuzzy inside, but can actually improve
your work performance and help you concentrate.

The study comes from researchers at Hiroshima University. In
Japanese, the word ‘kawaii’ means cute and so the report is rather appropriately
entitled ‘Power of Kawaii’.

Concentrate: Cute images of baby animals don’t just make you feel warm and fuzzy but can actually improve your work performance

Through three separate experiments a team of scientists found
that people showed higher levels of concentration being shown pictures of
puppies or kittens.

About 132 university students were divided up into three
groups, report the Wall Street Journal. Each group was assigned a different task. The first two had the most
compelling results. The first was a version of the game Operation where
participants had to carefully pick up small objects from a hole without
brushing the sides.

But to also determine whether the power of cute extends
beyond care-related tasks irrelevant to helping others, another task was purely
about numbers.

The second group was asked to find a given number from a
random sequence of numbers within a certain time limit. In both, they performed
the given tasks twice – before and after looking at seven pictures of either
puppies and kittens or adult versions.

In the number experiment, one subset of subjects was given
food images like steak, pasta and sushi to see whether 'pleasant' images
elicited similar effects as cute ones.

The subjects were told the pictures, which were viewed
during a 'break' in the tasks, were for a separate experiment.

In the Operation experiment, the participants who were shown
images of puppies and kittens performed their tasks better after the break than
those who looked at cats and dogs. Performance scores improved by 44%. They
also took their time. The time it took to complete the task increased by 12%.

'This finding suggests that viewing cute images makes
participants behave more deliberately and perform tasks with greater time and
care,' said the researchers, according to the published paper.

Similar jumps in performance were seen in the numbers
experiment, suggesting that looking at cute images increases attentiveness even
when the task at hand is unlikely to raise feelings of empathy.

Feeling good: 'Kawaii' or cute things not only make us happier, but also improve our behavior

The group that saw kitten and puppies were more accurate,
improving their scores by about 16%. They were also faster, increasing the
number of random numerical sequences they got through by about 13%. There was
no change among groups that saw cats and dogs, and food images.

'Kawaii things not only make us happier, but also
affect our behavior,' wrote the researchers, led by cognitive psychologist
Hiroshi Nittono. 'This study shows that viewing cute things improves
subsequent performance in tasks that require behavioral carefulness, possibly
by narrowing the breadth of attentional focus.'

The study’s authors write that in the future cute objects
could be used as a way to trigger emotions 'to induce careful behavioral
tendencies in specific situations, such as driving and office work.'
