Last month Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said: 'What a tragedy. [Andre] Muller was the aggressor.'

'He [Andre] struck one of the attendants whom I believe is still in the hospital.

'Another attendant had a shank, which is a home-made knife.

'The young man also participated in the assault and was stabbed.'
