A Second World War Royal Navy torpedo boat which sank two German destroyers is on the way to being restored to her former glory after spending half a century as a houseboat.

Engineer Paul Childs has spent a year working on the 73ft boat, which is moored at Bridgwater Docks in Somerset and is said to be the only known example of her kind.

The Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) 219 was built in Portsmouth in 1941 to defend Britain from the threat of a German invasion. She has now been floated as part of the next stage of her restoration.

Now moored in Bridgwater: Engineer Paul Childs has spent a year working on the 73ft Motor Torpedo Boat

London life: The torpedo boat was previously used as a houseboat on the River Thames, based in Chelsea

Repairs: The renovation of the torpedo boat - which was built in 1941 - is seen getting underway in Bridgwater

The torpedo boat - from a fleet which protected home waters and famously earned the nickname ‘iron men in wooden boats’ - was used as a houseboat for 50 years in Chelsea, south-west London.

Mr Childs said the project had cost him £30,000 so far and he needed to raise another £30,000 to finish it, adding that ‘stage one’ of the refurbishment at Tilbury Docks in Essex had been finished.

Mr Childs said: ‘We towed it under Tower Bridge from Chelsea. This is stage two. Then we go to stage three and hopefully, when she’s finished, she’s going to join another vessel that we’ve got.’

The MTB 219 was involved in attempts to intercept the Scharnhorst, Gneisneau and Prinz Eugen, known as the Channel Dash, in 1942.

She also rescued a number of aircrew from downed Fairey Swordfish bomber aircraft and helped sink two German destroyers.

Mr Childs said the vessel's hull was condemned in 2012 and her owner gifted the boat to Mr Childs in August 2013.

He added: ‘We’re going to put a wreath on the front, which has been donated, just to commemorate the guys that actually died on this vessel whilst in service, and the hundreds that died elsewhere in the campaign.’

Mr Childs said stage two of the restoration in Bridgwater was likely to take a year, but the vessel could stay in the town for longer.

During that time he hopes to host opens days and encourage volunteers to help out with painting and maintenance.

In addition to MTB 219, there are believed to be two other surviving MTB boats - 102 and 331 - although these are both of different classes to 219, leaving this as the only one in her category.

There were 577 Motor Torpedo Boats commissioned for the Royal Navy and 637 for the US Navy - totalling 1,214. Some 173 of these were lost during the Second World War. 

The MTBs - along with other boats in the Coastal Forces, a division of the Royal Navy - often operated close to enemy-occupied coasts, attacking ships in the English Channel and protecting our convoys around Britain's coasts.
