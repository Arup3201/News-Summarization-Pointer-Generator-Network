The data, taken from a 2014 study by Milward Brown that surveyed 16 to 44-year-olds, was recently presented at the Code Conference in California.

Tech analyst Mary Meeker used it in her annual internet trends presentation to reveal how technology is growing and developing on a global scale.

At the other end of the screen-time scale, Italians spend just five hours 17 minutes looking at their gadgets each day.

The figures suggest Britons watch the most TV, with an average of 148 minutes - or two hours 28 minutes - followed closely by the U.S with 147 minutes.

Meanwhile China residents use laptops and PCs the most, at two hours and 41 minutes, versus 65 minutes in Kenya.

Nigerians spend the most time looking at their smartphones, according to the chart, using apps, watching videos and sending messages for three hours 13 minutes a day.

By comparison, French people use smartphones just 79 minutes a day.

Tablets are most popular in the Philippines, and least popular in Japan, with one hour and 55 minutes, and 15 minutes screen time respectively

Research shows that almost six in ten people are not getting enough sleep - a 50 per cent increase on just a year ago.

Experts
 blame the rise on growing numbers of us using smartphones, tablet 
computers and other gadgets in bed and in the hour or two before turning
 in.

The blue light emitted by the screens suppresses 
the production of the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and so it’s 
important to avoid them before bedtime.’

Tablets are most popular in the Philippines, and least popular in Japan, with one hour and 55 minutes, and 15 minutes screen time respectively. 

Surprisingly, South Korea came 23rd in the list - above Germany, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Japan, France and Italy – despite its censorship laws and web restrictions.

Residents spend six hours and 19 minutes looking at screens, and this is just 31 minutes short of the global average.

Other findings from the Meeker presentation claim internet growth has slowed by less than 10 per cent in the past year, but mobile data traffic is up 81 per cent.

More people own TVs than phones still - 5.5 billion compared to 5.2 billion - and of the latter 5.2 billion, only 30 per cent are smartphones.
