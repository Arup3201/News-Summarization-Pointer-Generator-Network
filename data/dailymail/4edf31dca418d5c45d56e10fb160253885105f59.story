An Indiana police officer has caused outraged after offering t-shirts for sale with the legend 'Breathe Easy: Don't break the law' on the front. 

The t-shirts were produced by Corporal Jason Barthel of the City of Mishawaka Police in Indiana who owns and operates the South Bend Uniform Company. 

The t-shirts, which cost from $7.95 are seen as a play on the final words of Eric Garner who died after being restrained by the New York Police Department.

Corporal Bartel used his Facebook page in a bid to explain that he did not mean any offence with his t-shirt

Garner, who was restrained in a choke-hold after he was spotted selling single cigarettes in New York told officers 'I can't breathe', before slipping into unconsciousness. 

Corporal Barthel said criticism of his t-shirts is misunderstood. 

He said on his company's Facebook page: 'For those upset, please understand when we use the slogan "Breathe Easy" we are referring to knowing the police are there for you! 

'We are one people, one nation regardless of race, religion, creed or gender. We are all in this together. The police are here to protect and serve. 99.9% of us have the greater good in our hearts each time we strap on our uniforms and duty belts. 

'We are all one people and this is by no means is a slam on Eric Garner or his family, God rest his soul. Lets all band together as AMERICANS regardless of our feelings and know we can and will be better! Thank you for your support.'

Other basketball stars such as Kobe Bryant, centre, have also donned the t-shirt supporting civil rights 

It is understood that more than 100 of the t-shirts have so far been sold online. 

The 'I can't breathe' slogan has been used widely across America since Mr Garner's death last month. 

A number of celebrities, including basketball star LeBron James have worn t-shirt with the slogan. 

South Bend District Council President Oliver Davis told the New York Daily News: 'We believe that people should be able to breathe easy no matter what they're doing. Police should not take the right to breathe into their own hands.' 

Commenting on the controversial t-shirt, Mr Davis said: 'It has a strong message to people to let them know that justice is not fair. People need the right to be able to breathe easy no matter where we are in life and the justice system should be the ones to deal with that, not just the police officers.' 

Adam Duckworth posted on the company's Facebook page criticising the t-shirt. He said: 'This company exploits death, tragedy and ignorance for profit and publicity under the guise of supporting local law enforcers. 

'Contrary to the implications of their merchandise, DEATH DOES NOT = JUSTICE. If you bought the "breathe easy" shirt, you are basically agreeing that appropriate use of force when dealing with any and all petty criminals and even remotely "suspicious" people is to skirt the justice system entirely via immediate deployment of the death penalty.'
