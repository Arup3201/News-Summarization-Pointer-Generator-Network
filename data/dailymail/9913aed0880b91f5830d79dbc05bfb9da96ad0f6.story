Busted: Federal agents have so far unearthed 4,100 images of child pornography and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 CDs seized from David Moe's home

David Moe, 45, worked as a teacher at the exclusive Paddington Station School in Denver for the past 18 years.

He was arrested on July 24 for possessing large amounts of child pornography, but has since posted bail.

Moe will be allowed to leave jail on the conditions that he put his $283,300 home up for bail and remain in the custody of his parents.

The former teacher was also ordered to avoid all contact with children and is prohibited from accessing the Internet and subscribing to any Internet services, according to the Denver Post.

The judge demanded thirteen condition in total be met, including one that Moe live with his parents and wear an ankle monitor at all times.

He is ordered to remain indoors except when he must attend court.

During the bail hearing this week, Denver prosecutors read out excerpts from the secret 800-page diary of Moe, which he had kept since 1997.

Of one girl, Moe wrote, 'Did hold [name withheld by prosecutors] by the waist briefly, and she didn't flinch.'

Another record read: 'Had [name withheld] by the hips, and she was fine by that,'

Moe wrote of another little girl entrusted to his care. 'Gave
her a kiss on the cheek, and no bad reaction. I love her so much.'

In reply to one of his advances, Moe recalled a girl saying: 'I
only let my family tickle me.' To this, he said in his diary: 'She's obviously been coached.'

Prosecutors revealed the journal's 
existence in a Denver federal court to argue to 
Magistrate Judge Michael Hegarty that Moe should not be released before his 
upcoming trial.

But despite all of the chilling testimony revealed by federal agents handling the case, Judge Hegarty seemed skeptical the journal was, as Denver's 9News.com put it in their account of the proceedings, a smoking gun.

Instead, Hegarty suggested the journal 
may simply represent a child care worker's log of innocuous day-to-day 
activities with his students, chronicled to provide a defence against 
allegations of inappropriate conduct.

A defence attorney, for his part, maintained the journal, and the behavior contained therein, represented, as the Denver T.V. station put it, 'only a record of benign, caring interactions between a preschool teacher and his students.'

Paul McCormick did not try to gild his client's affinity for kiddie porn, but rather argued that Moe had constructed a de facto 'wall' between his sordid peccadilloes for porn, and how he interacted with the children entrusted to his care.

'When someone has 'fessed up and come clean,' McCormick told the judge. 'They're well down the road to recovery.'

Despite this, prosecutors reportedly disclosed information about an alleged incident 10 years ago when a Paddington family accused Moe of improperly touching their 3-year-old daughter. 

A federal agent testified Tuesday that the 2001 allegation concerned a young girl adopted from a Romanian orphanage who was still learning English.

The agent testified, according to 9News.com, the girl's parents said their daughter kept repeating the phrase 'Dave touch' as she pointed to her genitals. The agent also swore under oath that the girls' parents believe Moe once changed their daughter's diaper in a remote, unused section of the school.

However, Moe just faces charges of owning child pornography. He first reportedly told federal agents he owned about 200 images.

But prosecutors revealed in court Tuesday federal agents unearthed 4,100 images of child porno and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 CDs seized from Moe's home.

Along with that stockpiled stash of CDs, federal agents working for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security confiscated six portable hard drives and two desktop computers containing as-yet undisclosed materials from Moe's abode.

Tuesday's court proceedings were witnessed by many Paddington Station School parents, many of which, according to 9News.com, shielded their ears with hands and fingers so as to muffle disturbing accounts of what agents found in Moe's cache. 

Still, Hegarty reserved judgement, reportedly saying Tuesday, 'This is not the Roman Coliseum where it's a thumbs up, thumbs down decision by the community.'

The judge later added, 'There's no evidence of grooming. There is an obsession with his interactions with small children...That is strange. It is odd. It is disconcerting. It is alarming. I don't want a horrific event occurring on my watch.'

Moe resigned from the school last Thursday.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
