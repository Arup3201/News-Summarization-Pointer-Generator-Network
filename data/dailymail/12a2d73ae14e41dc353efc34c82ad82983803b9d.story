Customers claim a JD Wetherspoon pub hung Union Jacks on England's national day in case non-English people found the St George's flag offensive.

Drinkers at The Saxon Shore in Herne Bay, Kent, blasted the move as 'political correctness gone mad' after staff decided not use England's red and white flag in favour of the United Kingdom's.

When angry customers asked why the pub was decorated in Union Jacks, they claim staff told them that the St George's flag 'might offend'.

Outrage: Customers were furious after the Saxon Shore pub, in Herne Bay, Kent, hung Union Jack flags - representing the United Kingdom - instead of the St George's flag, to celebrate England's national day

Dental nurse Sam Gurney, 29, said she was 'gobsmacked' after she saw the St George's Day promotion while drinking with friends at the JD Wetherspoon pub.

She said: 'Being quite a patriotic person, I thought "Oh my God, why have they got the Union Jack instead of the St George?"

'I asked the manager and she said, "don’t go there". Apparently it was the Union Jack or nothing - I was completely gobsmacked.

'She said the policy was there because of fears the St George’s flag might offend people, which is just political correctness gone mad.

'It annoys me because when it was St Patrick’s Day, they made a big deal out of it flying Irish flags, hats and shamrocks but yet we can’t celebrate our national day.

'The Union Jack doesn’t make sense as Scotland are voting to break away. I’m pretty sure they won’t be flying it on St Andrew’s Day or St David’s Day.'

The Saxon Shore pub has now replaced the Union Jack flags with St George's flags. A spokesman for JD Wetherspoon said hanging Union Jacks was a tradition and was not done to stop offence being caused

After posting her disgust on Facebook, Miss Gurney received support from other drinkers.

Shirley Turner posted: 'Wetherspoons ought to be ashamed of themselves.

'St George is the patron saint of England, so for St George's Day fly the cross of St George which is the English flag. Simple!'

Katherine KJ Baxter added: 'Yet they’ll still fly the cross to show support to the English football team. How does that work then?'

Pub manager Hayley Bates said she understands why drinkers have questioned the decision to use the Union Jack, but said the pub had always used those flags.

She said: 'I can see her point, but we have always used the Union Jack to celebrate St George’s Day and it has never been an issue before.

'She started questioning it and she also said we should make a bigger deal out of St George’s Day than St Patrick’s, which I agree with.

'But I’ve been at Wetherspoons for eight years and nothing has changed in that time.'

A JD Wetherspoon spokeswoman denied the Union Jack flags were put up through fear of offending customers with the English national flag.

She said: 'They have got St George's flags up now, they were put up today.

'It was something which was done every year, it was the decorations they always had.

'Nobody had ever pointed it out before, so now they have changed the decorations. We like to please our customers.'
