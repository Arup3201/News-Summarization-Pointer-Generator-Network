A new Australian study has warned teenagers who are deemed a 'healthy weight' can still be suffering anorexia nervosa

Teenagers do not need to be severely underweight to be suffering from a life-threatening eating disorder, experts have warned.

A dramatic drop in weight should be a cause for serious concern, suggesting an adolescent could be at risk of severe medical problems.

A new study carried out at Australia's Murdoch Children's Research Institute noted a fivefold increase in the number of teenagers being admitted to hospital fulfilling all the criteria for anorexia nervosa - apart from being underweight.

The researchers examined a six-year period from 2005 to 2010, discovering more adolescents thought to be of 'normal weight' were suffering the illness.

Despite not meeting the low weight criteria of the eating disorder, the teenagers were found to be suffering from acute, life-threatening medical complications of weight loss.

Professor Susan Sawyer, director of The Royal Children’s Hospital Centre for Adolescent Health, said the research highlights that higher-weight adolescents who have lost a large amount of weight require careful medical assessment.

'Eating disorders can emerge at any weight,' she said.

'Clinicians need to have a high level of suspicion about a possible restrictive eating disorder in all patients who have rapidly lost weight or lost a significant amount of weight—even if the young person is not underweight at the time they present.

'There is poor understanding by health professionals, teachers and families of the risks of rapid, severe weight loss - at all weights.

'Most health professionals think "underweight" when they think of anorexia.

'It is therefore not surprising that many of these adolescents were very unwell by the time they were eventually admitted to hospital.'

Lead researcher Melissa Whitelaw 
said the dramatic increase in the proportion of adolescents admitted to 
hospital who were not yet underweight reflects increasing rates of 
obesity in adolescents.

'Obesity and eating disorders used to be considered as distinct health 
concerns with little overlap in patient populations,' she said.

'This
 data suggests that we need to be much more aware of the risks of eating
 disorders emerging in adolescents who are overweight.'

The research showed that while some of the patients had been advised by
 a health professional to lose weight, none were being professionally 
supported to lose weight at the time they presented with an eating 
disorder.

Researchers said this highlights the need for supervision of appropriate weight loss efforts in overweight adolescents.

Professor
 Sawyer, said: 'Regardless of their actual weight, clinicians consulting
 with adolescents who have lost a large amount of weight should, among 
other tasks, review the patient’s weight loss strategies to ensure they 
are sustainable and safe.

'They should also carefully assess the patient’s cardiovascular health.

'For those adolescents who have rapidly lost a large amount of weight, anorexia nervosa should be considered.'

Researchers said that due to a combination of factors including the nature of eating disorders, lack of parental awareness, lack of training in health professionals, and delays in accessing specialist services, there are often significant delays in making the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, even in adolescents who are very underweight.

Both researchers are part of The Royal Children’s Hospital Specialist Eating Disorder program.

The research was carried out by Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, The Royal Children’s Hospital and the University of Melbourne.

Eating disorder charity, Beat’s chief executive, Susan Ringwood, told MailOnline: 'Eating disorders are complex mental illnesses that have serious effects on physical health too. It’s very helpful to make people aware that eating disorders are not just about being very underweight.

'We know you can’t tell if someone is ill just from the shape and size of their body. 

'We also know that sometimes a strict measure of BMI is used to decide if someone is eligible for specialist treatment.

'This study shows how potentially dangerous that could be.'
