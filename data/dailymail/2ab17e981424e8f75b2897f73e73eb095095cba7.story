Banks are to extend their opening hours to meet demand for low-deposit mortgages backed by the Government.

David Cameron announced last night that the Help To Buy scheme, which provides 95 per cent mortgages, will start next week – three months ahead of schedule.

Brushing aside accusations that it will lead to a housing bubble, the Prime Minister said he had acted to prevent first-time buyers’ dreams of owning a home being ‘trashed’.

State-owned RBS bank said last night 
it was expecting to be so inundated with applications that many of its 
branches would remain open later.

The three-year, £12billion Help To 
Buy scheme will give tens of thousands the chance to buy a house worth 
up to £600,000 with just a 5 per cent deposit. The Government will 
underwrite an additional 15 per cent of the loan to make the deal 
attractive to lenders.

RBS and NatWest will be the first to 
start offering the cheap mortgages, followed by the Halifax. HSBC, 
Santander, Nationwide and Barclays have yet to decide whether to take 
part.

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr 
Show at the start of the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Cameron said:
 ‘The Bank of England said expressly, “There isn’t a bubble”.

The housing market is recovering, but
 from a low base. If you look at prices outside London and the South 
East, they’re only going up by 0.8 per cent.

David Cameron would block a mansion tax after the next election, even if he was forced into another coalition.

The Liberal Democrat's have long argued for a levy on multi-million pound homes, with Labour also backing the idea.

But Mr Cameron made clear that for as long as the Tories are in power he will block the plan.

But he suggested council tax and stamp duty could be used to raise more money.

He told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'I don't think this is a good idea.

'I want to live in a country where people work hard, they save and they put money into their homes.

'I think it's right people pay council tax, it's right people pay stamp duty - and we put that up - but to go after someone's house every year with a wealth tax, I don't think that's a sensible thing to do.

'I have never been in favour of this idea. I think it's a bad idea.'

Asked if voters could be sure that there would be no mansion tax if he was Prime Minister after the next election, Mr Cameron added:

'That's correct. Stamp duty yes, council tax yes, but I think wealth taxes are not sensible for a country if it wants to support wealth creation, wants to reward saving and people who work hard and do the right thing.'

‘Talk of a housing bubble to people here in Manchester and they will laugh in your face.

‘As Prime Minister, I’m not going to 
stand back while people’s aspirations to get on the housing ladder, to 
own their own flat, to own their own home, are being trashed. That’s why
 we need to act.’ 

He said a housing market that 
required young professionals to pay a £50,000 deposit was ‘broken’, 
adding: ‘If you haven’t got rich parents you can’t get that sort of 
money.’ 

Ross McEwan, the new boss of RBS 
Group, said details of  a range of mortgages for first and second-time 
buyers will be released within days to help at least 25,000 people.

He added: ‘Despite the economy 
recovering, we know many families are finding it tough  to get a 
mortgage deposit together. We are committed to helping as many people 
as  possible across Britain to get on with their lives, to buy their 
first home, to move to a bigger house as their family grows.’ 

But Business Secretary Vince Cable warned that it ‘could inflate the market’ and create a housing bubble.

Former Bank of England  governor Lord King suggested it was ‘too close for comfort’ to a general scheme to guarantee mortgages.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘If 
David Cameron is serious about helping first-time buyers, he should be 
bringing forward investment to build more affordable homes.

Under this Government, housebuilding is at its lowest level since the 1920s.’
