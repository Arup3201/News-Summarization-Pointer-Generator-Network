Tragic: Amanda Telfer was walking past a building site when a falling window frame hit her on Hanover Square in central London

The 13-feet tall window that crushed an 'extremely talented' young lawyer to death weighed more than half a tonne, an inquest heard today.

Lawyer Amanda Telfer, 43, was
fatally injured as she ate a banana while passing by a construction 
site on Hanover Square, off Oxford Street in central London.

Criminal charges could now be brought after she was killed by the frame that took ten people to pull off her body, the inquest was told.

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox opened and adjourned the case today to allow the Metropolitan Police and Health And Safety Executive to continue their investigation.

'This investigation will take a considerable amount of time as at the moment we still do not know whether
charges will be brought in this case,' she said.

Floral tributes were left where she died, including a note reading ‘sorry we 
couldn’t save you’, just metres from where the frame that killed her lay
for several days as police cordoned off the area.

Describing what happened coroners officer Barry May told Westminster Coroner’s Court today: 'Amanda Barrie Telfer died on August 30 this year. She was walking along Hanover Street.

'On the pavement there were two window frames weighing approximately half a tonne each that had been propped against a wall of an office building.

'As she walked past a window frame fell on her pinning her to the ground. Members of the public removed the frames and started CPR.'

It was confirmed that “a gust of wind caused the frame to fall over'.

Miss Telfer, who worked for legal firm Keystone Law, was a volunteer for the charity Reprieve, helping represent British-born Neil Revill, 40, who faced a possible death sentence for the double murder of a drug dealer and his girlfriend in California in 2001.

He was eventually sentenced to life after a trial last year.

Speaking from Guantanamo Bay, Clive Stafford Smith, the founder of Reprieve, said her death was 'tragic'.

'I heard about poor Amanda a couple of days ago - what a tragedy,' he told the paper.

'She was a volunteer at Reprieve, and an excellent one, and then very kindly ‘legalled’ my new book, so it was a pleasure to have the chance to catch up with her then.

'How very sad it was to hear, and my heart goes out to her family.

Poignant: The giant window frames lay strewn on the pavement outside the building site for several days

Heartfelt: Flower tributes included one note apologising to the lawyer for not being able to save her life

Devastated colleagues have paid tribute to the 'extremely talented' 43-year-old.

James Knight, partner at Keystone Law in central London where Ms Telfer 
was an intellectual property and media consultant, said: 'It is with 
great sadness that we confirm Amanda Telfer, a lawyer at Keystone Law, 
was killed last week, in a tragic accident in Hanover Square.

'Amanda joined Keystone in 2005. She was an extremely talented lawyer, 
much admired by her clients and colleagues. They, like us, are 
devastated by this news. Obviously our thoughts are with Amanda's 
family.'

Ms Telfer previously worked as senior legal counsel at Random House and as a litigator at Denton Wilde Sapte, both based in London.

She was also a freelance consultant for human rights campaign group Reprieve UK between 2004 and 2009, where her role involved gathering evidence for reports on British Nationals awaiting trial and up for the death penalty in America.

In 2005 she produced a play called 'Lorilei' which was performed at the London Fringe theatre and Edinburgh Festival that year.

Tragedy:
A police tent was put up where a window fell on top of Amanda Telfer as she passed by Hanover Square, just off
Oxford Street, in central London

Shock:
The accident happened as workmen were installing windows at a new 
multi-million pound six-storey office block. Ambulance crews rushed to 
the scene and battled to save the woman but she was declared dead

She studied at Maths and Philosophy at Manchester University before gaining her law qualification at BPP Law School in London and starting her first job as a trainee at Rouse & Co/Willoughby & Partners in 1997.

The emergency call was made by a man delivering electrical cables to the area. He said that the woman was 'flattened', and that he thought he saw her 'draw her last breath'.

The 999 operator told him to get closer and probably saw the moment she died.

'Her eyes were open and I saw her hand move and then I think I saw her last breath and then the light went out: she'd gone,' he said.

'You'd have more chance of winning the lottery than that happening to you.

'She was in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time.'

The construction company running the site, Westgreen Construction Ltd, said they would do 'whatever is necessary' and called it a 'terrible accident.'

Dr Nichola Lloyd, an out-of-hours GP at the Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Guernsey tried to help.

‘I walked past there about ten second beforehand,’ she said. ‘It 
was really just the wrong place at the wrong time and it could have happen to 
any of us.

‘I almost went into autopilot. She clearly had very bad injuries, but you 
just have to think that is a person whose life needs saving and you do what you 
can to help.’

Witnesses claimed the ‘very
heavy’ window had been left ‘propped’ on a wall on the ground floor, 
and that barriers guarding the building site had recently been removed.

The accident happened at 11.30am in 
Mayfair’s Hanover Square, which houses some of London’s most expensive 
offices. 

An art gallery is on the ground floor and the Vogue building, 
the headquarters of publisher Conde Nast, is opposite.

Dario Motti, 65, said the 12ft-high 
frame had been propped up against a wall before it fell on the woman. ‘I
saw the frames delivered,’ he added. ‘They were so heavy they
were lifted in by crane.’

Taped off: Police officers were stationed around the scene where a woman has died after she was struck by a falling window pane

Investigation: The Health and Safety Executive launched an investigation into the tragedy and shocked witnesses took to Twitter to express their horror and the freak accident which was caused by high winds

A man delivering electrical cables to another building, who did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the frame off the woman

Kohei Matsumoto, manager of a nearby 
Itsu sushi restaurant, added: ‘Two of my team members saw a girl turn 
left into Hanover Street. She was eating a banana.

‘The next thing they saw was this 
window frame falling down on her. She didn’t scream – it happened so 
quickly.’ 

A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who 
did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the 
frame off  the woman.

‘I heard this incredible loud bang,’ 
he said. ‘I turned round and the frame was on the ground. I was hoping 
it was a coat underneath – but then I saw an arm.

‘Her eyes were open and I saw her hand
move and then I saw her last breath, and then the light went out – 
she’d gone. She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.’

Building site: Workmen were installing windows in a six-storey office block in Hanover Square in London when the incident happened

Beverley Hazel, from Kennington, South London, was on her way to work at 11.30am when she saw the woman lying in the road.

She said: ‘She was very young and 
slight. I’ve got two daughters, one younger and one older than this 
woman. I was in bits. If it had been my daughter I would have wanted 
someone with her.’

A spokesman for Westgreen Construction
Ltd, of Richmond-upon-Thames, Surrey, which is managing the building 
project,  said: ‘We will do whatever is necessary. This is a terrible 
accident.’

The woman’s body, which had been covered by a yellow police tent, was removed by a private ambulance at 6.45pm.
