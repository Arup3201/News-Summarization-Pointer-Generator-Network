Jailed for assisting: Bernie Beddoe was jailed for four years after helping a woman wrap her boyfriend's body in tarpaulin and hide it in a wheelie bin

The man who helped a woman hide her boyfriend’s body in a wheelie bin after she killed him has been jailed for four years.

Bernie Beddoe, 60, helped Karen Otmani, 42, wrap the body of Shaun Corey in layers of tarpaulin, put it into a plastic packing case before depositing it in a wheelie bin which she kept in her bedroom of her Forest Hill house for 11 days.

Otmani drugged Mr Corey, 42, and then tied him to her bed at her home in south London, before either placing a plastic bag over his head or smothering him with a pillow on June 4 last year.

Beddoe, who was caught after a footprint found on the tarpaulin wrapped around the body was identified as his, was cleared of murder but convicted of assisting an offender today.

Otmani had been found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey in November and jailed for life with a minimum term of 17 years.

When police found Mr Corey, his body was so decomposed they could not establish a cause of death.

Judge Gerald Gordon told Beddoe, of Brockley, south London at Old Bailey: 'There can be no doubt that with your assistance the body was concealed and remained concealed for a total of 11 days.

'As a result of that delay, no positive cause of death could be established pathologically and there was no toxicology possible.

'I have no doubt that all caused further distress to the family.

'Assistance of the type you provided in the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence.'

She was jailed for life in November for murder

During Otmani’s trial, the jury at 
Old Bailey heard that she had been talking about getting rid of her 
on-off lover and had even asked another boyfriend to experiment with 
some blue liquid to see if it would knock him out.

Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, told the jury: 'When she began to speak about killing Mr Corey, he did not take it seriously.'

Mr Corey was heard arguing with Otmani in her bedroom before they were joined by Beddoe, 60, whom she called Uncle.

New boyfriend Keith Jones rang police after visiting the flat and being told 'He’s in there'.

Miss Cheema said: 'She said she’d measured her freezer but it was too small and she needed to get another freezer.

So badly decomposed: Judge Gerald Gordon told Beddoe at Old Bailey (pictured) that because Mr Corey's body was found 11 days after his death, the cause of death could not be established causing 'further distress to the family... the concealment of a murder demands a significant sentence'

The court heard that Otmani told officers: 'I killed him. He freaked me out and I killed him.'

Described in court as a ‘wicked 
liar’, mother-of-two Otmani had met Mr Corey, from Rossendale, 
Lancashire, in 2007 through internet dating site ‘Plenty of Fish’ and in
2010 they had a child together.

The relationship became 'tempestuous and inconsistent' and the couple separated several times.

Otmani was said to be angry when she found out that Mr Corey was seeing other women.

Convicted and cleared: Beddoe was cleared of murder but convicted of assisting an offender

After discussing plans to kill him 
with boyfriend Keith Jones, Otmani put Rohypnol into Mr Corey's can of 
beer when he was at the flat on June 4 last year.

He fell asleep and came round to find Otmani had tied him to the bed with her tights.

A young boy in the house heard him screaming at Otmani to let him go as she called Beddoe to the maisonette to help her kill Mr Corey. 

The child was told Mr Corey was asleep because he was 'very, very tired'.

Otmani sold Mr Corey's car and phone and used the wheelie bin as bedroom furniture.

She even invited Mr Jones into her bedroom and asked if he could smell the decomposing corpse.

He called the police but an initial search of the flat failed to reveal the body. 

It was not until June 15, 11 days after he was killed, that the wheelie bin was opened.

By then in the heat of summer the body was too badly decomposed to establish a cause of death.
