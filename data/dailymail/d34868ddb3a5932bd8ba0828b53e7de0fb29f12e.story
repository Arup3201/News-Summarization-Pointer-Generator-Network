Newborns are set to have a taste of the 007 lifestyle with an Aston Martin-designed ride touted as 'the most exclusive pram in the world'.

The £2,000 pram is the product of a partnership between the luxury carmaker and Silver Cross, another British brand which first began designing carriages for babies in 1877.

The two companies claim the Aston Martin Edition of the Silver Cross Surf is 'designed to perfection with every detail considered', down to the leather which is an exact match to that used in the cars.

Exclusive: Aston Martin has crafted 800 prams in association with Silver Cross

Logos: Both the Aston Martin and the Silver Cross logo are displayed prominently

Ride in style: The pram is trimmed with the same suede used in the manufacture of the luxury car and bears the famous winged logo on the seat and metalwork, while the design of the aluminium wheels is based on the Aston Martin One-77

Aston Martin touches include the Alcantara lined seat pad - a high quality and expensive suede manufactured in Italy - to the super soft leather-trimmed handle and bumper bar.

The design of the aluminium alloy wheels is based on the Aston Martin One-77, which retails for £1.2 million.

The Silver Cross air-ride suspension guarantees a smooth ride on all terrains and the multi-position handlebar 'ensures comfortable pushing for everyone'.

Ultimate comfort: The seat is lined with Alcantara - a high quality and expensive suede manufactured in Italy

High tech: The hand band can be moved into a variety of positions to make pushing more comfortable

Versatile: The Silver Cross can be converted into a carry cot so it can be used from birth

A complete system: The Silver Cross can also be converted into a forward facing push chair

Silver Cross said it will only manufacture 800 of the travel systems, ensuring it remains the 'ultimate in exclusivity.'

Each pram will come with its own certificate of authenticity and an engraved brushed chrome plaque to confirm that it is one of a limited edition.

Royal legacy: Silver Cross has a history of supplying prams to royalty but it is not clear if the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will use this new model for their baby when it is born

Exclusive: Only 800 of the bling buggies are being made and they will only be available at Harrods

Silver Cross said: 'A complete travel 
system with a fully reclining seat, forward and rear facing pushchair 
settings and a carry cot for use from birth, this really is a must have 
for the most fast-paced lifestyle and is quite simply the most exclusive
pram in the world.

'The Silver Cross Surf - Aston Martin Edition is the ultimate in comfort for your baby and in style for the owner.'

Would you spend £2,000 on a buggy?

Silver Cross chairman Alan Halsall said: 'I am thrilled that Silver Cross and Aston Martin are working together and have produced this brand new totally exclusive pram which is a great testament to two of the most famous British brands.'

Silver Cross has a history of supplying prams to royalty but Mr Halsall declined to be drawn on the new model's possible suitability for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, saying: 'We're delighted if any consumer chooses a Silver Cross product.'

An Aston Martin spokesman said: 'Silver Cross has a long tradition of providing the finest for new families. The Silver Cross Surf - Aston Martin Edition has taken inspiration from our own expertise in engineering and design, with many of the materials and techniques used on the pram, also used in our own Aston Martin interiors.

'We warmly welcome the Silver Cross Surf - Aston Martin Edition into the Aston Martin Lifestyle Collection.'
