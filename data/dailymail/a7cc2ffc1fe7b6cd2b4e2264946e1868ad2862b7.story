Four years of bloody conflict has ravaged their homes and families, leaving any memories of peace  shrouded in helpless grief.

For Syria's thousands of refugees seeking relief from the destructive war, Christmas Day is one of hundreds spent in fear for their lives. 

On the border, children once jubilant and ignorant of death now drag rusty bicycles through the soggy grounds of refugee camps to entertain themselves. 

Their mothers, left destitute and hungry, hang their clothes to dry in the crisp winter wind. 

It is a scene replicated across the border time and again, with no hope for relief imminent as Islamic State fighters continue to clash with the country's military regime and brigade of vigilantes. 

Here, a haunting collection of images taken on the grounds of one refugee camp in Aleppo reveals their plight. 

In Aleppo, a boy pushes his bike barefoot through terracotta mud at a refugee camp where thousands have been living in hope of peace

A toddler walks through the camp carrying a pot wearing flimsy sandals and a muddied jacket and trousers

A girl helps a younger child through the sticky mud at the refugee camp. It has been four years since the bloody conflict in Syria began

Young boys wade through puddles and muddy washing in the camp which is filled predominantly with women and their children

The shoes of a family of boys lie outside their temporary home next to their mother's, coated in mud in the unkempt grounds of the camp

A pair of women's shoes lie coated in mud outside one of the hundreds of tents at the camp in Aleppo, Syria, where families have taken refuge

Two young boys rest in the winter sunshine beneath one of the yards of clothing lines. Right, children kick through the mud 

Children sit on rocks as an older woman passes them by carrying water on in a bucket rested on her head in the refugee camp

A woman takes shelter in the shade as children's clothes lie on washing lines. Right, a boy and a girl play in one of the many dirt paths between the tents

Thousands of families have been forced to flee their homes for refugee camps across the Syrian border with Turkey to escape conflict

The baron camp where women and children have been living. The bloody conflict in Syria has raged on for four years now 

Two toddlers stand in the relative dryness of their tent as rugs dry on the wall across the muddy walkway

Heavy rainfall has waterlogged much of the camp causing even more damage to the families' few personal belongings
