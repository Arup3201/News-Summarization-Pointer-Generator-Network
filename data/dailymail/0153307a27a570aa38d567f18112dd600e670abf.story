The father of Becky Watts’ boyfriend has spoken of the ‘horror story’ faced by his son after the discovery of her dismembered body.

Ivan Oberhansli, 45, said his son, Luke, 17, was ‘all over the place, devastated,’ adding: ‘It’s like something out of a horror story. You can imagine how he must feel.’

Becky, 16, went missing from her Bristol home on the morning of February 19. But detectives discovered her 'cut up' body at a house in the Barton Hill area earlier this week.

Her stepbrother, Nathan Matthews, 28, has been charged with her murder. Matthews’ girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of attempting to pervert the course of justice. 

Three men and a woman have also been accused of helping to hide the dismembered body the teenager.

Karl Demetrius, 29 and his girlfriend, Jaydene Parsons, 23, allegedly acted to help Matthews evade detection.

They were charged with assisting an offender after the 16-year-old's cut up remains were found in their home. 

Karl's twin Donovan Demetrius and James Ireland, 23, have also been charged with the same offence of assisting in the 'disposal and concealment' of Becky's body parts.

The defendants appeared in court on Friday and spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth and did not enter pleas during the short hearing.

Suspects: Jaydene Parsons, 23, (right) has a young son with her boyfriend, 29-year-old Karl Demetrius (left). Both have today been charged with assisting an offender in relation to the Becky Watts murder

In custody:  Donovan Demetrius (left) has also been charged as has Jamie Ireland (right). A fifth suspect was released without charge

They are jointly charged with assisting an offender without lawful authority or reasonable excuse between February 22 and March 3.

The charge alleges that they 'did an act, namely assist in the disposal and concealment of the body parts of Rebecca Watts with intent to impede the apprehension or prosecution of Nathan Watts, who had committed the offence of murder'.

Delivery driver Matthews, 28, is accused of killing his stepsister and his girlfriend Shauna Hoare, 21, is accused of 'consistently lying to police' in an attempt to protect her boyfriend.

Matthews, who was unshaven and wearing a grey sweatshirt, appeared via video link from HMP Bristol, and did not enter a plea.

Judge Neil Ford QC, Recorder of Bristol, remanded Matthews in custody and set another hearing for March 26 and he expected a trial after September 1.  

The four defendants were shuttled to Bristol Magistrates Court on Friday after being charged with the crime

Police discovered body parts on Monday night after they were called to a property at Barton Court, in the Barton Hill area of Bristol (top right). They also searched a second house, and a blue car parked outside (bottom right). Barton Court is just a street away from a house in Cotton Mill Lane (bottom left) which has been searched extensively, and is opposite Becky's boyfriend Luke's house (bottom centre). Police  also searched Becky's home (top right), and a house in Southmead (top left) where they seized a black Vauxhall Zafira

Prosecutor James Ward told the court: 'Nathan Matthews is charged with the murder of Rebecca Watts.

'The allegations of this case have been well-rehearsed in the press recently and I do not propose to go into the finer details.

'There are still people helping the police with their inquiries. Therefore, it would be wrong to place before the media further details about this case.' 

Mr Ward said police were assessing 'at least' 1,200 exhibits in connection with the case.

'Much forensic work needs to be done,' he said.

Paul Cook, representing Matthews, said his client was not making an application for bail.

Matthews' girlfriend, Shauna Hoare, 21, who is charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, will also appear before the court charged with perverting the course of justice on that date. 

They were detained after detectives attended a house in Barton Court, Barton Hill in Bristol, following information that Becky's body had been 'cut up'.   

A photograph from Darren and Anjie Galsworthy's 2013 wedding has emerged showing Matthews (far left) next to the couple, with Hoare (next to Mrs Galsworthy) and Becky (right) as bridesmaids

As a white custody van left the court on Thursday, members of the public who had been waiting outside the court banged on the sides of the vehicle and yelled abuse as it drove away

Matthews and Hoare stood emotionless in the dock to face charges on Thursday after 16-year-old Becky's dismembered body was discovered 80 yards from their home earlier this week.

Their separate court appearances were a stark contrast to the wedding photograph which was taken by a family friend in August 2013, after Becky's father Darren Galsworthy, 51, married Matthews' mother Anjie, 49, at a church ceremony in St George, Bristol.

Nearly 100 guests attended a reception at the nearby Bendix Club, Kingswood, where Becky and her stepbrother were seen laughing and joking together. 

Matthews, who held his and Hoare's young daughter in the picture, was dressed in the same grey suit and cream waistcoat as his stepfather. Hoare and Becky wore matching blue bridesmaid dresses.
