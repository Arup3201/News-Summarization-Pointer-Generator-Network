Skimpy bedwear: Women in the south are more likely to put on sexy nightie for bed, while northern ladies prefer to cover up

While Northern girls may be famed for the skimpy outfits they wear on a night out, it seems it is their Southern counterparts who are more relaxed when it comes to bedroom attire.

According to new research, girls down South wear far skimpier clothes in bed at night, with 73 per cent of females in London sleeping in just their underwear or the nude.

And the further north you go, the more likely you'll find women covering up in flannel pyjama bottoms and long-sleeved tops, something researchers put down to the colder weather.

Sharon Webb, head of lingerie buying and
 design at Debenhams, who carried out the survey, said: 'From 
barely-there sleepwear to bananas-in-pyjamas attire, there is a strong 
connection between what you wear to bed and where you live.

'Sleepwear is likely to be bought on impulse, but buying behaviour suggests that the further south you go, less is worn to bed.

'Pyjama
 parties in the south may be a little bit more revealing than those in 
the north, with the sauciest sleepers living in the South West.'

In the South West - especially Devon, 
which has the second highest number of over 50s in England - short, thin-strapped, loose-fitting nightgowns and skimpy sleepwear 
are the most popular choices.

In the north, 87 per cent of women 
said they preferred a comfy set of flannel pyjama and soft slippers while ladies of the Midlands favour shorts and vest combos.

In Wales, imitations of men's shirts remain popular with 77 per cent of those questioned favouring them while women in Ireland favour classic 
knee-length nighties and sweeping nightdresses and dressing 
gowns are popular in Scotland.

Professor Karen Pine - a psychologist from Hertfordshire University, who analysed the results for the department store - said: 'Our clothes are a means of self-expression, and this extends to our sleepwear too.

'What you wear to bed can say a lot about your lifestyle, your relationship and your personality. Paying attention to what you wear to bed is just as important as carefully choosing your day wardrobe.

Cosy and warm: Northern women prefer comfort over style when it comes to nightwear

'The
 right sleepwear not only tells others a lot about you, it can also 
boost your feelings of self-esteem, sensuality and security.'

NORTH: Flannel
 pyjamas and slippers - The most traditional style of nightwear which 
reflects a conventional personality. This style suggests a person who 
prefers comfort and warmth to unbridled passion.

MIDLANDS:
 Shorts and vests - Not trying hard to seduce or impress, playful and 
comfortable with who they are. Not quite bold enough to go fully nude, 
preferring to tease rather than reveal.

SOUTH:
 Undies or nothing - The uninhibited sleeper who slips under the sheets 
in just their undies, or nothing at all, is not afraid of their 
passionate side. Bedtime may be more about sensuality and intimacy than 
it is about sleep.

IRELAND: Classic
 nightie - A classic nightie is the safe choice of someone always 
concerned about other people. She worries about what the postman might 
think if she has to make a quick dash for the door in the morning.

SCOTLAND:
 Long nightdresses and dressing gowns - Indicates a person who sleeps 
alone, or who really feels the cold. Getting a good night's sleep is 
their priority and their nightwear has to cosset and protect them, as 
the arms of a sleeping partner might do for others.

WALES: Sleep
 shirt - A less conventional choice - some might say an indecisive one, 
covering mainly the top half. The say an indecisive one - covering 
mainly the top half. The sleepshirt wearer has a thoughtful personality,
 is a careful decision-maker and it may take time to really get to know 
them.
