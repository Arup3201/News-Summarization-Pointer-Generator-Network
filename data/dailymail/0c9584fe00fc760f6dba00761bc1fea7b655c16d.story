Middlesbrough’s long-time pursuit of Jelle Vossen has finally come to an end with the Belgium striker signing on loan.

The 25-year-old joins from Racing Genk on a season-long deal having been tracked by Boro all summer.

And Vossen arrives with an impressive goalscoring pedigree in his homeland having netted 111 times for Genk and Cercle Brugge in the Jupiler League. 

Done! Middlesbrough have signed Racing Genk striker Jelle Vossen on a season-long loan

Goal: Vossen scores past Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech during a Champions League Group E match in 2011 

He has appeared 12 times for his country, scoring twice, after making his debut in 2009.

Vossen is Aitor Karanka’s 11th signing of the summer and second deadline-day addition, Dutch Winger Yanic Wildschut completing a loan move from Heerenveen earlier in the day.
