David Cameron and his cabinet colleagues have discussed fully nationalising the Royal Bank of Scotland because they are angry about how little British banks are lending.

Senior members of the Coalition want to buy out the remaining 18 per cent of the institution and then ramp up how much it loans out to boost the UK's depressed economy.

RBS is already 82 per cent publicly-owned and a further £5 billion would be needed to complete a taxpayer-funded takeover.

Chancellor George Osborne is opposed to fully nationalising RBS, which would mean taxpayers taking full responsibility for the bank's toxic debts.

But his rival, Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable, is in favour of a split in RBS to create a business bank with a clean balance sheet and a mandate to expand lending.

A Treasury spokesman told MailOnline: 'This is wild speculation: we are committed to repairing and returning RBS to full health so that it is able to support the UK economy in the future, and the current strategy is working to achieve that.

'The Government’s policy has always been to return RBS to the private sector, but only when it delivers value for money for the taxpayer.'

Yesterday the Chancellor launched his latest scheme to free up credit by offering lower interest rates to banks, but some at the top of Government believe forcing RBS to lend more is the only way to push the banks into action and get money to cash-starved businesses in particular.

'We can understand why Labour didn't want to do this: it would be politically disastrous for them to nationalise a bank,' one senior adviser told the Financial Times but added the banking sector would be much less worried if the Coalition made this move.

This would mean directing the bank to increase its lending to companies, which would be open to legal challenge by the remaining shareholders.

The only way to get round this is to buy out those shareholders.

A full nationalisation was not on the agenda, an industry source also said, citing several reasons why the Treasury would not have the appetite for such a move.

In addition to the extra cost, EU regulators would be unlikely to allow a state-owned RBS to aggressively undercut rivals on lending, and the government would attract more criticism for bonuses, lending and issues like the Libor interest rate rigging scandal if it wholly owned RBS, he said.
