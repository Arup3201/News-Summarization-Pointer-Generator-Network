Technology today is making us a ‘selfie-important’ nation when it comes to getting noticed.

According to new research, 13.3 million Brits suffer from ‘60-second social media meltdown’, becoming impatient for a reply, acknowledgement or approval in the online world, far more than compared to daily life.

The latest survey shows the trend for posting daily ‘selfies’, holiday snaps or updates from a night out on the town can result in Brits feeling put out if friends and followers don’t acknowledge them.

Wait a minute: According to new research 13.3million Brits suffer from '60 second social media meltdown', becoming impatient for a reply, acknowledgement or approval in the online world

Neediness is rife on dating apps and websites, with 43 per cent of Brits expecting a ‘like’ or reply to a love note within a minute before losing their calm.

This is closely followed by a ‘like’ or comment on a Facebook status, which 38 per cent of the nation expects within a minute.

Like: 31 per cent of the UK craves acknowledgment of an Instagram post and expects a 'like' on their Instagram or Facebook 'selfie' picture all within 60 seconds

31 per cent of the UK craves acknowledgment of an Instagram post and expects a ‘like’ on their Instagram or Facebook ‘selfie’ picture within 60 seconds.

But it seems that it’s just communication via technology we’re impatient with, as our British tradition of queuing still stands.

The nation is willing to wait up to an average of 4.8 minutes for everyday things such as being served in a bar (4 minutes), waiting to receive a menu in a restaurant (4 minutes) and waiting for public transport (6 minutes).

Britain’s growing impatience doesn’t stop there as nearly a fifth (17 per cent) of the nation admits to falling out of love with their new gadgets and gizmos within just five months of purchasing them.

A fifth of Brits (20 per cent) wants to upgrade to a newer phone model within just four months of purchasing, 20 per cent of the nation envies a new MP3 player within six months and another 20 per cent of the population lusts after the latest tablet within six months.

Anthony Vollmer, CEO, Tesco Mobile, who carried out the survey, said: 'Smart phones and social media have transformed the nature of how we communicate and their instantaneous nature means we are not just constantly in touch, but also craving an immediate response.

'We know consumers are impatient and excited about the latest models and handsets on the market, with almost three quarters (72 per cent) of Brits admitting they’d like to upgrade their tech twice a year.'
