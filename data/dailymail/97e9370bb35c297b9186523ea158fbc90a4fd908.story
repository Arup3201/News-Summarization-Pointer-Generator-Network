Rooney told the Manchester Evening News: ‘It's been a good few weeks, we've got a new manager who wants us to play a different style of football. We've had to adapt. We've had some good results against top opposition so we can be pleased.

‘I think the system suits the team, not only myself. The manager came in and had a look at the players we've got. He's done what he thinks is best suited for our team.

‘He's a tough manager but he's been great since he came in. He's given us all a different way of looking at football, which we haven't had before.

‘It's been great for us and hopefully that will continue.’

The 28-year-old is looking forward to the new campaign following United's triumph out in America.

'We wanted to win games, play well. And obviously we've done that. We've won a trophy as well,' said the striker.

'It's always nice to beat Liverpool. We're happy with the work we've done out here, now we go on to Valencia and then the season starts.'
