The Oregon teen convicted of felony hit-and-run for mowing down and killing 6- and 11-year-old stepsisters in October was sentenced Friday to three years probation in an incredibly emotional court hearing.

A tormented Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros addressed the parents of Anna Dieter-Eckerdt and Abigail Robinson in a Washington County courtroom last week and was no doubt deeply relieved when Anna's mother tearfully offered her forgiveness.

'I should have gone back. I should have thought about you guys,' the weeping teen confessed to Susan Dieter-Robinson and her husband, Abigail's father Tom Robinson.

'I should have gone back': At her sentencing on Friday, Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros (left) tearfully apologized to Susan Dieter-Robinson (right at center) for mowing over her daughter Anna (right at left) and stepdaughter Abigail (right at right) in October as they hid beneath a pile of leaves

Even the judge noted Garcia-Cisneros will likely be haunted by what she's done for life, but today she faces more pressing issues since her undocumented immigrant status could mean she'll be deported in light of her crimes despite being a beneficiary of the DREAM Act.

According to the Oregonian, Judge Rick Knapp's decision to spare Garcia-Cisneros jail time was based on the words of Anna and Abigail's parents.

'I remembering thinking how horrible you would feel when you realized you hit two young girls,' said Susan Dieter-Robinson, mother to Anna and stepmother to Abigail. 'You were one block away, I’m sure, scared.'

Unthinkable: Anna (right) died at the scene. Abigail (left) died later at a Portland hospital after Garcia-Cisneros accidentally ran them over in her boyfriend's SUV in October. She chose not to turn herself in or aid the investigation after she learned she may have killed the girls

Minutes after Garcia-Cisneros hit the leaves on her way home from getting fast food, her brother returned to the scene and saw a man standing over the pile, screaming. The man spoke to him briefly.

The boy went home and told his sister she may have hit two children.

Defense attorney Ethan Levi said Garcia-Cisneros was in a state of shock and denial after learning of the children and fixated on the possibility she wasn't the driver who struck them.

Prosecutor Bracken McKey told jurors that Garcia-Cisneros' choice not to come forward was morally and legally wrong.

'I’m going to choose forgiveness,' said a weeping Dieter-Robinson. 'Cinthya, I forgive you, I do.'

Nobody wins: Garcia-Cisneros (at right in her mug shot) was sentenced to 3-years probation for two counts of felony hit-and-run. she begged Dieter-Robinson and her husband and the rest of the girls' family for forgiveness and received it. However, she is an undocumented immigrant in the U.S. under the DREAM Act and could now face deportation at age 19

'The grief in this courtroom is palpable,' Judge Rick Knapp said at Friday's sentencing. 'I don't want to add to it'

'I don’t want you to spend any more time in jail,' Deiter-Robinson continued. 'Live a life of honoring my girls.'

The
 prosecution said the crash itself was an accident, but the woman was 
required to return to the accident scene as soon as she learned of it. 
Her defense lawyer said the law doesn't say anything about the 
requirements when a driver learns later about an accident.

Authorities said the two girls were likely concealed by the leaves and not visible to Garcia-Cisneros.

Anna died at the scene. Abigail died later at a Portland hospital.

Before the sentence was read, Garcia-Cisneros--wearing shackles and orange prison garb--spoke once more.

Authorities said the two girls ¿ later identified as stepsisters, 6-year-old Anna Dieter-Eckerdt and 11-year-old Abigail Robinson ¿ were likely concealed by the leaves and not visible to Garcia-Cisneros. But prosecutors successfully argued that the her crime began as she learned she may have hit the girls and still did nothing

Outgoing: Anna Dieter-Eckert was a first-grader at Dilley Elementary, where in the past few months she had made several close friends

'You say you forgive me, and I hope that you do,' she said after offering ever more tearful condolences and apologies.

'I do,' replied Dieter-Robinson.

The judge called the grief in the room 'palpable.'

'I don't want to add to it,' he said before handing down the relatively light sentence.

The
 judge had the option of imposing only probation or a maximum of three 
years in prison. In addition to probation, the judge also ordered 
Garcia-Cisneros to serve 250 hours of community service.

An Immigration attorney said the woman will next be taken into federal custody on an immigration hold and she may be deported.

Though
 she has temporary permission to be in the country legally under the 
federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, applicants in 
that program cannot have certain criminal convictions.

Aspiring actress: Abigail Robinson, pictured with her theater friend Natasha Kujawa, loved singing and dancing, and had just landed a role in a local production of the musical Annie

Community in shock: A makeshift memorial appeared outside the grieving family's home in Forest Grove, with people leaving flowers, balloons, stuffed animals and handwritten condolence notes
