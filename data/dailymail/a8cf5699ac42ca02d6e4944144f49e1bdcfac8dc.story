New camera footage offers a first-hand view that few people have ever been able to record: what a black bear attack really looks like.

Filmed on a game camera at Island Park in Idaho, the 30-second video shows the animal sniffing around the site, before lunging toward the lens.

The black bear swipes his paw at the screen, shaking the camera violently, before scampering away.

The black bears are native to the Island Park, Idaho region - however, they often only emerge at night

Idaho's Island Park is located only 15 minutes from the west side of the famed Yellowstone National Park.

The Greater Yellowstone National Park Area is known for its high population of black bears.

While the bears are most active at night, they can be spotted at any time of day - particularly during the early fall berry season.

In order to get this type of footage, an outdoor camera, like a game camera, is required.

They are tough, motion-activated cameras, designed precisely to capture these types of wildlife encounters.

Using infrared night-vision technology, their extremely long battery life means that they can be left for weeks to really allow hunters to get a sense of the area.

As in this instance, the camera can even be fastened to a tree or bush, minimising the risk that a predator will run off with it.

Using a motion-activated outdoor camera, such footage is possible to capture - without endangering humans
