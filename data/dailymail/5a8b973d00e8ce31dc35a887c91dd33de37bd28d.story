These are the terrifying scenes as a Syrian fighter jet streaks across the sky in eastern Al-Ghouta, near Damascus and drops two unguided bombs into a heavily populated civilian area. 

The jet, which appears to be an SU-24, flew low over the Al-Gouta area during its bombing run before leaving the area. 

The mission is believed to be in response to an earlier attack Islamist fighters struck the Syrian capital with at least 38 rockets on Sunday, killing seven people, a monitoring group said, in one of heaviest attacks on Damascus in over a year.

The aircraft, believed to be an SU-24, dropped its two bombs on Al-Ghouta, near Damascus following an Islamic rocket attack on the capital

The two unguided bombs caused extensive damage to a number of buildings following the attack yesterday afternoon

State media confirmed the attack and said at least four people were killed. It said the army was retaliating.

The Saudi-backed Islam Army, based in the eastern Ghouta region near Damascus, had warned earlier that it would hit back against an air strike last week in Ghouta in which more than 40 people were killed.

Damascus residents said Sunday's rockets seemed to be mortars and Katyusha.

Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which monitors the violence in the country, said this was the heaviest attack on the capital for more than a year.

The Syrian army was shelling the rebel-held town of Douma where the Army of Islam is powerful, Abdulrahman said. Douma lies on one of the main roads linking the capital with Homs city further north.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports.

Syria's air force has launched daily air strikes in the civil war, which started after security forces cracked down on pro-democracy protests in 2011. At least 200,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

Throughout Damascus has been relatively calm, shielded from the war since government forces pushed the rebels back in 2013.

A host of celebrities have written an open letter to David Cameron calling on Britain to do more to help Syria's refugees find safety in the UK.

Oscar winner Emma Thompson, comedian Michael Palin and musician Sting are among those who told the Prime Minister they were 'ashamed' by Britain's efforts so far.

The Syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme was set up at the start of last year after the Government was pressured into dropping its previous opposition to admitting refugees directly from the region.

Ministers argued that the UK, as the second biggest contributor to aid funds for the war-torn country, could contribute more by improving conditions on the ground.

The scheme expects to relocate only a few hundred Syrians over the next three years.

Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood and director Ken Loach also signed the letter to Mr Cameron, which was in support of a joint campaign by the Refugee Council, Amnesty International and Oxfam.

They told the Prime Minister: 'In a climate where children are sent to work in order to help their parents survive, where young girls are sold off as child brides and where torture victims are unable to rebuild their lives, every resettlement place countries like Britain provide is a lifeline.

'Resettling "several hundred people" just isn't good enough for a global leader. This issue isn't about migration statistics or party politics, it's about people. It's about the values that we in Britain hold dear; compassion and humanity.

'Your choice is simple, yet historic. You are in a position to offer some of the most vulnerable people in the world safety in Britain. You can offer hope. You can offer a future.' 

Meanwhile several celebrities have written to Prime Minister David Cameron claiming that Britain should offer to rehome more Syrians 

The letter also described how countries such as Germany and Austria have increased the number of places they are offering in light of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East with the rise of Islamic State.

'We are ashamed that the UK has so far failed to do likewise,' the celebrities added.

The UN's Refugee Agency UNHCR is calling on governments around the world to offer 100,000 resettlement places for Syria's refugees in 2015/2016.

Refugee Council chief executive Maurice Wren said: 'The Syrian crisis presents us with one of the greatest refugee crises of our time and, arguably, one of the greatest moral questions of our time.

'The UK's commitment to the relief effort has been laudable but it's not enough. The question is, does David Cameron want to go down in history as the prime minister who rationed his compassion to a few hundred people when there was the opportunity to offer safety to so many more?'
