Hurricane Gonzalo is barreling straight towards Bermuda, threatening to wreak havoc on the island with 130 mph winds.

The National Hurricane Center places Bermuda directly in the path of the monster hurricane, which is the Atlantic's strongest in three years. Satellite images show the Category 4 storm is around 600 miles south of the island and Accuweather predicts it will make landfall late on Friday and into Saturday.

Flights out of Bermuda are fully booked for the rest of the week and hardware stores were inundated with shoppers, the Royal Gazette reported.

'We sold out of generators [Tuesday], and items like batteries, tarp and ropes have been flying off the shelf,' Mark Stearns, a hardware store general manager, said. 'Everything that is on the hurricane list has been going fast and furious. People are definitely nervous about this storm.'

After smashing into Bermuda, Hurricane Gonzalo is expected to head northeast and hit Newfoundland in far eastern Canada on Sunday.

The storm has already battered islands across the West Indies, with images revealing destroyed boats, down trees and debris strewn across beaches in Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin on Tuesday.

Authorities on some of the smaller islands buffeted by Gonzalo said at least one person was dead and two were missing. An unidentified elderly man was killed aboard a boat in St. Martin's Simpson Bay Lagoon, which looked like a ship graveyard on Tuesday with several masts protruding from the water.

Dozens of boats were damaged and power was knocked out in the Dutch Caribbean territory, and Acting Coast Guard Director Wendell Thode said 22 of the 37 boats destroyed by the storm were in the Simpson Bay Lagoon.

'Most of the boats that are destroyed are completely under water,' he said. 

On Tuesday, when the storm hit the West Indies, it had top sustained winds of nearly 125 mph (205 kph) and was centered about 705 miles (1,135 kilometers). It is moving northwest at 13 mph (20 kph).

On Wednesday, it was updated to a Category 4 storm - storms that have sustained winds of at least 130 mph (209 kph) with the potential to cause catastrophic damage.

'Folks in Bermuda are going to need to start paying attention to this thing,' Dennis Feltgen, a National Hurricane Center meteorologist, said by phone.

Bermuda's government posted a hurricane watch for the British territory, urging islanders to keep an eye on the storm's progress. 

Authorities are still searching for a man last seen on a dinghy near the French Caribbean territory of St. Martin and another man last seen standing close to a harbor in St. Barts, said Matthieu Doligez, general secretary of the prefecture in St. Martin.

Amy Arrindell, vice president of the St. Maarten Zoological and Botanical Foundation, said the St. Maarten Zoo was heavily damaged but no animals escaped or died. She said trees were uprooted, the petting zoo was destroyed and the animals' enclosures were flooded.

'There is major damage to the structure,' she said. 'It is total devastation.' 

The last major hurricane to directly hit Bermuda was Fabian in 2003, National Hurricane Center spokesman Dennis Feltgen told USA Today.

Gonzalo is the strongest storm in the area in three years; the last Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic Basin was Ophelia in 2011. Its highest winds were 140mph.
