A plane crash near the remote western Alaska village of Saint Marys killed four of the 10 people aboard, including an infant boy, an Alaska State Troopers spokeswoman said on Saturday.

The pilot and three passengers died in the Friday night crash, spokeswoman Megan Peters said.

Peters had no immediate word on the six survivors' condition.

A plane-which may have been similar to this Hageland Aviation Cessna 208-- crashed and killed four out of ten passengers on Friday night

The single-engine, turboprop Cessna 208 was a Hageland Aviation flight from Bethel to Mountain Village and Saint Marys, said Kathy Roser, a spokeswoman for Era Alaska airline. Hageland is part of Era Alaska, Roser said.

The wreckage was found about 4 miles east of Saint Marys.

An emergency locator beacon signal helped pinpoint the crash site, National Transportation Safety Board investigator Clint Johnson said.
