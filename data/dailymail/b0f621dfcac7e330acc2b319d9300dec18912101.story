According to a report, chemists and pharmaceutical companies are rigging the price of so-called 'specials' drugs to overcharge the NHS

Drug companies and pharmacies have been accused of striking up underhand deals to overcharge the NHS millions of pounds.

Pharmaceutical companies may have inflated the price of more than 20,000 drugs that are not covered by NHS price regulations.

Following an undercover investigation by its reporters, the Daily Telegraph claims that the prices of the so-called 'specials' drugs - those prescribed when a patient has needs that cannot be met by normal licensed medicine - have been rigged with chemists offered backhanders to sell them.

The newspaper secretly recorded representatives from several drugs manufacturers offering reporters posing as pharmacists deals on 'specials' that would see both their firms and chemists pocket additional NHS cash.

The investigation found that some of the firms offered to provide invoices for some of its drugs at double the cost price.

Chemists would then pass that invoice onto the NHS which would pay the inflated bill.

Other companies are alleged to have offered to supply generic drugs free of charge in return for the right to supply the chain with special drugs.

Another firm offered to pay an annual fee to chemists who sold their drugs.

The Telegraph said that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation following its report.

Scandal? The report alleges that companies are marking up the price of more than 20,000 drugs

He told the Telegraph the allegations were 'deeply concerning'.

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said that an investigation will be launched

'We have always been clear that NHS money should always be spent wisely for the benefit of patients.

'Any specific information received indicating or alleging fraud will be investigated by NHS Protect.'

Jim Gee, a former chief executive of the NHS counter-fraud service, said: 'Behaviour of this type diverts funds from where they are intended and undermines the provision of quality patient care.

'The victims are the British people and the Government need to ensure that the NHS is better protected in future.'

The drugs companies said they were looking into the claims allegedly made by their representatives, while it was reported that one firm had suspended a member of staff.

A spokeswoman for Pharmarama International Limited, based in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, said it would not comment while an internal investigation was being conducted.

Quantum Pharmaceutical said it was investigating the allegations and had suspended a member of staff.

The spokesman added: 'We have clear and strict internal policies regarding the trading agreements that we operate with our customers, which are entirely legitimate, lawful and ethical.

'We remain fully commitment to providing a quality, value for money service to our customers and will be giving our full co-operation to the Department of Health and other regulators in the event of any subsequent industry-wide response relating to the report’s findings.'

Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for drugs firm Temag told the Telegraph: 'It would be totally unrepresentative to make any suggestion that we are involved in any sort of practice to unfairly charge the NHS.'
