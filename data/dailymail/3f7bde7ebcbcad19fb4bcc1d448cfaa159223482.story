A 26-year-old man left unable to speak and 'too angry to work' after a head-on car crash has been awarded £4million after an eight-year legal battle.

Paul Vallance suffered a serious brain injury at the age of 18 after a driver lost control and ploughed into his car in Wiltshire, but doctors did not realise the full extent of it for years.

The debilitating brain damage was dismissed as a ‘mild head injury’ and when he returned to work he lost  a series of jobs because of his sudden bursts of anger with customers.

Paul Vallance suffered a serious brain injury at the age of 18 after a driver lost control and ploughed into his car in Wiltshire, but doctors did not realise the full extent of it for years.

Mr Vallance's undiagnosed brain injury left him unable to exercise self-control or use appropriate language and he was regularly fired for losing his temper.

His mother Tina, said: 'My loving son had been replaced by a much angrier, hostile young man.

'He would spend hours just staring at himself in a mirror, saying repeatedly 'I look like Paul, but I don't feel like Paul'.

'My heart was in bits seeing him like he was back then.

'Several retail positions followed in quick succession but Paul just couldn't cope.

He spent 19 days in hospital after the 2006 crash which happened on the B4192 (pictured)  between Chilton Foliat and the turning for Ramsbury near his  home in Marlborough

His mother Tina said her son was  replaced by a much angrier, hostile young man and he was fired from a string of different jobs 

He spent 19 days in hospital after the 2006 crash which happened on a country lane near his home in Marlborough.

The former trainee manager physically recovered from a broken leg, shoulder and nose but also suffered from amnesia, lost the ability to speak and was confused.

Those classic signs of a serious brain injury were missed when the insurance companies first dealt with his compensation claim months later.

His mother said her son dramatically changed in the weeks and months after the crash.

When he began to string words together again, his language was aggressive and abusive.

She instructed a different law firm to get a fresh compensation case started - one which was not appointed by his car insurers and did not dismiss his 'mild head injury'.

It wasn't until that law firm, Novum Law, commissioned proper brain scans that it became apparent Paul had suffered serious damage to the frontal lobe of his brain.

He had suffered a cerebral oedema, intra-cranial hematoma and subdural haemorrhage, all of which damaged his emotional control and executive functioning.

This had left him with behavioural difficulties and anger management issues.

Specialist brain injury lawyer Huw Ponting took Mr Vallance's case to the High Court, where the £4million pay-out has now been agreed.

Mr Ponting said: 'The collision has had a significant impact on Paul's life and family.

'A whole eight years' on from the accident, he continues to suffer from the effects of the severe traumatic brain injury he sustained, affecting all aspects of his life.

'For a young man to be faced with the prospect of never being able to work again or live independently without support is unimaginable.

'We are thrilled to have secured justice for Paul which will help finance the specialist care and support that he will need for the rest of his life.'

Paul is now in a specialist care unit in Wigan in Lancashire.
