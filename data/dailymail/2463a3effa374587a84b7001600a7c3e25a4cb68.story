Police were shot at and buildings destroyed as rioting broke out in two major French cities, presenting the first big test of newly-elected president Francois Hollande’s leadership.

Disaffected youths from north African immigrant estates went on the rampage in the northern cathedral city of Amiens on Monday, setting fire to property and seriously injuring several police officers.

And yesterday there were outbreaks of trouble in the south-western city of Toulouse as the spectre of widespread urban disturbances returned to haunt France.

Riots: At least 16 police officers were seriously injured during the disturbances on council estates in the city of Amiens in northern France overnight

Devastation: The disturbances were the first serious urban rioting to break out across France since a new Socialist government was elected earlier this year

Mr Hollande broke off from his holiday
on the Riviera to pledge that the government 'will mobilise everything 
it can to fight this violence’.

He added: 'Security is not only a priority for us, it is an obligation.’

Trouble first broke out in the Fasset 
district of Amiens when a driver was stopped by police for a routine 
check. Youths taunted the officers before throwing missiles at them.

The situation was made worse by the 
presence of a crowd gathered to mourn a 20-year-old man who was killed 
in a motorcycle accident last Thursday.

Buildings were burnt down in the north
of the city and many police officers were seriously injured, including 
16 who suffered wounds from shotguns and fireworks.

Riot police used rubber bullets and deployed a helicopter to try to stop the trouble, which intensified throughout Monday night.

'The situation got out of control and spread to nearby streets,’ said a police spokesman.

'Soon hundreds of rioters were 
involved. They were setting fire to bins and to cars and attacking 
anybody who tried to stop them.’

North Amiens is one of 15 tinderbox 'priority security zones’ identified by the government as requiring increased policing.

There have been sporadic incidents of 
violence in the Mirail area of Toulouse all week, with police threatened
as they tried to arrest a Muslim youth.

Mr Hollande, who is keen to prove his 
Socialist government is tough on crime, yesterday sent interior minister
Manuel Valls to Amiens to say that 'everything would be done to combat 
violence’.

But Mr Valls was jostled and booed when he arrived, with 
locals accusing him of being as insensitive to the concerns of 
low-income immigrants as Nicolas Sarkozy was.

The far-right Front 
National party, which has huge support in the depressed north of France,
tried to link the riots with 'mass immigration’ causing 'huge 
insecurity’ across the country.

France has a notorious history of urban riots, with a state of emergency being declared as recently as 2005 when hundreds of estates went up in flames

A local mayor in Amiens blamed 
mounting social tension for the trouble, saying those on isolated 
estates faced discrimination in everything from housing to employment.

Gilles Demailly, the Socialist mayor 
of Amiens, said: 'There have been regular incidents here, but it has 
been years since we’ve known a night as violent as this, with so much 
damage done.’

He estimated that around £800,000 worth of damage had been caused by the latest riot.

France is notorious for locating 
immigrant families, including thousands of Muslims from its former North
African colonies, on rundown housing projects such as Fasset, where the
worst of the latest trouble broke out.

Summer rioting represents a huge challenge to Mr Hollande during a period of record unemployment and economic decline.

Thierry Mariani, a member of the 
conservative UMP party and former minister for transport, called for a 
'tough response’ from the government.

He said: 'If it is confirmed that 
officials responsible for defending the law have been shot at by thugs 
then this is totally unacceptable.’

A state of emergency was declared in 
2005 as hundreds of towns and cities went up in flames, with Mr Sarkozy 
sending out extra police.
