Hearts owner Ann Budge is demanding answers on the safety of her club’s supporters following Friday’s abandoned Championship match at Rangers.

Followers of the Tynecastle club are claiming on social media and online message boards that they were targeted after the game at Ibrox was called off due to snow on the pitch after just 25 minutes.

Videos have been posted online showing angry scenes with both sets of fans being segregated by stewards, while some Hearts fans claim missiles were thrown at buses departing the area of the stadium.

Police Scotland have confirmed an investigation is underway following ‘several acts of disorder at Ibrox’ with Rangers fans also protesting against their club’ s board.

A concerned Budge said she needs more answers before she decides what action she will take.

‘Whether it is Hearts fans or any other fans, if you see that sort of thing happening then you need to be asking questions,’ said the Tynecastle chairwoman.

‘We’ve had lots of things being checked and double checked.

‘Clearly there are some questions that we need to ask.

‘We have to find out the facts as best we can and take it from there.’

Budge also confessed she was taken aback that referee Bobby Madden allowed the game to go ahead after the Govan area was hit by snow and freezing temperatures.

She told STV: ‘I was looking outside and wondering if we were seriously going to be playing a game. But I’m not the expert and the experts made the decision so I wouldn’t question that.’

Meanwhile, Budge supports plans to introduce regionalised group sections to the League Cup by 2016.

Under proposals discussed at a meeting of all 42 of the country’s senior clubs at Hampden yesterday, the competition would start earlier, at the beginning of July.

A group stage would guarantee clubs at least two games in the tournament but there was caution expressed by lower league clubs yesterday, who had concerns over a longer season.

‘Well, it seems to me like a very good idea,’ said the Hearts owner. ‘But that said, a number of the other clubs are part-time.

‘There are some real issues for them if we do that but I think it’s a step in the right direction.’

Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston: ‘I think it’s unlikely there will be any changes for next season.

‘It’s probably going to be summer of 2016 before they are implemented. But yes, regional groups are on the agenda.

‘I think there was a desire to have summer football and part of the plan is to have the League Cup start in early July and regionalised so that fans don’t have to travel so far on warm summer evenings and weekends.

‘They will be able to come out and enjoy competitive football at an earlier stage than normal.’
