A property tycoon nicknamed 'Mr Fastcash' and a professional gambler have been jailed for their roles in a £6.8million mortgage racket.

Marshall Joseph, 56, and Alick Kapikanya, 45, were part of a housing crime gang which 'stole' luxury homes across Britain and then illegally used them to obtain loans.

Joseph, who got his nickname due to his firm Fastcash Property, joined forces with Kapikanya, who in turn used the scam to fund his own life of casinos, residencies at top class hotels and homes in millionaire rows.

Chauffeur driven businessman Kapikanya helped Joseph recruit a team of conmen including a crooked conveyancing agent to acquire the title deeds of houses then use fake passports or driving licences and utility bills to pose as the real homeowners, Manchester Crown Court heard.

The gang would go to solicitors' offices throughout Britain using the fake documents to sign over the properties to Joseph so he could take out loans with a number of financial institutions - securing the mortgages against the 'stolen' homes.

The true owners of the ten properties involved in the scam knew nothing about the illegal loans secured on their homes. Police only uncovered the fraud after Joseph defaulted on secured loans repayments and it emerged he was involved in a string of scams.

Some of the money from the scam went on gambling sessions at the Ritz Hotel Casino in London.

Joseph, Kapikanya and their accomplices grabbed £3.5m and were about to get a further £3.3m from their racket when they were stopped.

Joseph, who lives in a £750,000 double fronted detached home named 'The White House' in the village of Hale, Cheshire, has now been jailed for four-and-a-half years after he admitted conspiracy to defraud and a bankruptcy offence.

Kapikanya admitted conspiracy and was jailed for six years yesterday.

In August 2007 Joseph was tied up and stabbed in the thigh during a vicious raid on the house. Five masked men stormed the property and held him, his wife, then aged 23 and her sister aged 21 and left them bound as the thugs ransacked the property for valuables.

The robbers escaped in the family’s blue Mercedes 320 with a Rolex watch, pearl necklaces, a diamond engagement ring and a wedding ring. Joseph was treated for his wounds and it is thought the robbers were never traced.

Kapikanya, who was the director of a string of property firms, acquired a £1.2m lakeside mansion in Mere near Knutsford and later a £650,000 apartment in Hale with the help of his scamming.

Police said the mortgage fraud began in 
2007 when Joseph and Kapikanya focused on different scams which involved
 properties in Worsley, Greater Manchester, Altrincham, Holmes Chapel 
and Malpas, Cheshire and Sleaford, Lincolnshire.

Working in tandem, the pair arranged for property titles to be transferred from real homeowners to themselves before money was electronically transferred into the accounts of the gang - with the loans secured against those properties.

Kapikanya, who owed £100,000 for the hire of luxury cars, arranged for the unwitting lawyers to transfer £60,000 into a casino account he held at the Ritz. He used the money to pocket £82,000 on the roulette wheels only to gamble away £8,000 later.

Victims of the fraud included an elderly doctor and his wife who were considering selling their recently closed nursing home and their family properties for £3m.

Another house in Hale worth £3m was illegally used as security for two loans totalling £800,000. In another scam Joseph hired a surveyor to value an £850,000 country house set in a 1.5 acre paddock whilst the unwitting owner was on holiday.

Myra Trigg, 57, (left) was given eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years. Co-conspirator Bruce Robertson (right), was jailed for 30 months

He was arrested in February 2010 but 
made no comment in police interviews. It emerged he had been declared 
bankrupt in December 2008.

Detective
 Constable Craig Moylon, of Greater Manchester Police Major Fraud Unit, 
said: 'This was a meticulously planned series of frauds 
which involved different people playing different parts all for a common
 purpose with no regard for the devastation they were to have on many 
innocent parties.

'Kapikanya
 used the funds he raised to gamble heavily at many of the most 
exclusive casinos in the country while driving very expensive cars and 
staying in the finest hotels, sometimes for months at a time.

'The
 offenders carried out their actions with no regard for the lending 
organisations or the innocent homeowners who aside from the traumatic 
experience of fearing they had lost their homes or were potentially 
liable for loans of hundreds of thousands of pounds were forced to 
instruct solicitors to have their homes put back in their name and the 
secured loans removed from their titles.'

Bruce
 Robertson, 51, and Irene Perciful, 50, both of Cambridge, were
 found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Robertson got 30 months and 
Perciful 12 months.

Peter Tanner was given 15 months suspended for two years, plus 140 hours unpaid work

Peter Tanner, 54, of Pampisford, Cambridge, and Myra Trigg, 57, of Moss Side, were given a 15 month sentence suspended for two years, with 140 hours unpaid work, and a 32 week sentence suspended for two weeks, with eighty hours unpaid work, respectively, after admitting fraud.

Chris Campbell, 31, of Banstead, Surrey, was given a 12-month sentence suspended for two years, plus 140 hours unpaid work, after admitting acquiring criminal property.

Ben
 Southam, Senior Crown Prosecutor for North West Complex Casework Unit 
said: 'This was a complex three year investigation. When the defendants 
were arrested they had succeeded in defrauding various financial 
institutions of £3.5million, and had attempted to raise a further £3.3million.

'I
 have the satisfaction of seeing some of them go to prison. But I think 
they should all have got 100 years’ hard labour with no remission' 

- Victim Gwyneth Cooke

'Each of them had 
their own specific role to play in this fraud, and all were fully aware 
of their actions. The mortgages and loans were obtained against houses 
they did not own, and without the knowledge of the real home owners.

'The
 true owners knew nothing about the loans being secured against their 
homes and were caused considerable distress and inconvenience to prove 
to the lenders that they knew nothing about the loans.'

Speaking after the conviction, widowed victim Gwyneth Cooke, 59, described her ordeal.

Mrs Cooke, whose husband John died in 2000, was diagnosed with breast cancer just weeks before the trial.

She
 discovered the scam when a solicitor told her she owed money on the 
home she had lived in for 27 years in Worsley, Greater Manchester.

Devastated: Widowed Gwyneth Cooke, of Worsley, Greater Manchester, was one of the victims

She said: 'I was absolutely horrified.

'All they had were a few utility bills and documents and someone was able to get a loan on my house pretending to be me.

'I would never ever forgive them for as long as I live.

'I
 have the satisfaction of seeing some of them go to prison. But I think 
they should all have got 100 years’ hard labour with no remission.'
