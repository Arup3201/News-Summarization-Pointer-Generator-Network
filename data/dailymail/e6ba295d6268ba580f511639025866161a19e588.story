Daniel Sturridge has given Liverpool a boost after declaring that 'he feels good' as he steps up his recovery from injury.

The 25-year-old took to social media on Monday to indicate the improvements made in his fitness levels by initially tweeting: 'I feel so good right now...' before uploading a picture via Instagram with Liverpool first-team physiotherapist Matt Konopinski.

Accompanied with the caption 'Chilling with Matt.. Feeling good. No smiley smiley... Straight faced vibes with tired eyes,' Sturridge looks composed after revealing on Saturday that he expects to be fit for the Anfield outfit's next match away to Crystal Palace later in the month.

VIDEO Rodgers hoping for swift Sturridge return

The Liverpool striker has been sidelined since September with a thigh injury suffered on England duty before sustaining a calf problem.

But speaking ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League 2-1 defeat at home to Chelsea this weekend, Sturridge said he hoped to be available for selection for his side's first match after the international break.

'I'll be ready for that one, God willing,' Sturridge told BT Sport . Regarding his spell on the sidelines he added: 'It's the worst feeling to be honest but that's football. Everyone picks injuries up.'

Sturridge has played only three times for Liverpool this term with his last outing in their 3-0 victory at Tottenham in August. 

Sturridge has been out of action since sustaining a thigh injury while he was on international duty 

In his absence Brendan Rodgers' side have struggled - with the club currently 12th in the Premier League - and £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli still yet to break his goalscoring duck for the Reds in England's top flight.

The 25-year-old was not included in England's squad for next week's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and Roy Hodgson said he did not speak to  Rodgers about the striker's fitness.

When asked if he had spoken to the Liverpool boss, Hodgson told Sky Sports News: 'No not at the moment but I have it in mind to do so of course.

'I was waiting to see what the situation would be with him (Sturridge). It's very good news to hear that he's travelled but of course before I select him again I would check with the player and the club that we were doing the right thing.'
