Traditionally, Lent was a solemn period of contemplation leading up to Easter when we wore hairshirts or denied ourselves food.

But this year, the Church of England is advocating a more modern approach, suggesting we turn off our computers and eat breakfast cornflakes more slowly, instead.

New official guidelines on how we might observe Lent in 2013 also suggest we 'Say hi to a neighbour' and turn off lights in a room we're not using.

'Have a screen-free day': The Church's modern Lent guidelines are backed by the Archbishop of York

The 21st century take on the 40-day religious observance comes in booklet called Love Life Live Lent, launched yesterday at the House of Commons by Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu.

Apparently inspired by the way Great Britain 'came together' during last year's Jubilee and Olympic celebrations, the Church of England issued the new advice to encourage us to 'slow down' in our hectic lives and 'come together' for the good of our local communities.

The booklet contains a different tip for each day of Lent.

One reads: 'It is so easy to get side-tracked, pulled into watching that bit more telly or to spend that bit more time on the computer.  We don’t intend to, it just happens.

'Sometimes all we need to do is to make the decision to do something different, some good that we meant to do but haven’t so...do something different.

'Outside of work, have a screen free day and do something different'

'Really taste your cornflakes': The Church of England advice is aimed at getting us to slow down

Another passage says: 'The world whirls by at ever-increasing speeds.... we can go at such a speed that we forget to savour the good things that we have.

'The ability to savour is a frame of mind, and if we become better at tasting our cornflakes we might discover that we get better at savouring other good things too, so slow down...

'Take longer over breakfast and really savour your cornflakes (or whatever else you have!)'.

No more hairshirts: The Church of England has issued more modern advice for both adults and children

The booklet includes eco-friendly advice such as 'Fill a bag with litter', 'Use the washing-up water to water some plants', and 'Turn off the lights in rooms that no-one is using'.

It also encourages Christians to build relationships within their community, suggesting 'Invite someone you don't know very well to tea (or for a coffee, or for a drink)', or to 'Say hi to your neighbours today or when you next see them'.

It says: 'The idea is that we learn new 
lessons about ourselves, about the world and about God that we then 
apply for the rest of our lives.'

The booklet was written by theologian Dr Paula Gooder and her husband, the Reverend Peter Babington, and they also produced a children's version.

The booklet contains suggestions for youngsters to try during Lent such as 'Play with someone you don't usually play with', and 'Make some cakes and share them with your friends'.

At yesterday's launch, Dr Sentamu said the new advice was aimed at bringing communities together as witnessed last year.

He said: 'In 2012 the nation really came together during the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the London Olympics.

'We saw people putting love and care for their neighbours into action, and there was a real mood of celebration.

'When we all pull together, and do our bit, anything is possible.

'The Love Life Live Lent books are a great source of encouragement for us to be the change we want to see in our communities.

'We may feel our own contribution is small, but even a small drop of water can turn a waterwheel - in 2013 let's aim for better.'

Stephen Timms, MP, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Faith and Society, said: 'This Lent, I look forward to hearing of acts of kindness on the part of adults and children which can encourage us all.'

Say hi to your neighbours today or when you next see them

Try something new, for example a different food or a new experience

Fill a bag with litter (then put it all in the bin!)

Say thank you to God for one of your meals today

Ask someone how they are and take time to listen to the answer

Use the washing-up water to water some plants

Take longer over breakfast really taste your cornflakes (or whatever else you have!)

Sit still for five minutes and listen to your breathing

Give lots of smiles away today

Find something you don't use and give it away

Learn the words of something by heart, for example a poem, prayer or son

Outside of work, have a screen-free day and do something different

Phone someone you love but haven't seen for a while
