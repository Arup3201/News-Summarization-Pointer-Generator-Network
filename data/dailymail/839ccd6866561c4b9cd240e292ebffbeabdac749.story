Toulon have apologised to Leicester following incidents involving Martin Castrogiovanni and Delon Armitage at Welford Road on Sunday.

Castrogiovanni's expletive-ridden tirade against Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill after Toulon's 25-21 Champions Cup defeat is being investigated by competition organisers European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR).

EPCR is also assessing allegations that former England full back Armitage directed offensive language at spectators.

Toulon have announced they too will be examining the evidence and could punish their own players.

Toulon said in a statement: 'Toulon has decided to carry out its own inquiry and could sanction the players if it deems it necessary. The Red and Black club has taken the opportunity to apologise to Leicester Tigers for the discomfort caused by these events.' 

The French Top 14 club are due to face Leicester in the Champions Cup again this weekend at the Stade Mayol.

Delon Armitage allegedly threatened to 'take the face off' a Leicester supporter during the half-time break 

Their statement added: 'Toulon have taken note of the decision of EPCR to open an inquiry after Leicester decided to report the behaviour of Martin Castrogiovanni and Delon Armitage during and after the Leicester/Toulon match on Sunday.

'Leicester Tigers have reported to EPCR two incidents which the EPCR disciplinary officer is currently looking into in order to determine, among other things, if it is appropriate to take action for misconduct.

'The first incident concerns the allegations that Delon Armitage made insults towards or in the proximity of spectators during the match.

'The second incident concerns the allegations that Martin Castrogiovanni criticised the Leicester Tigers sporting director, Richard Cockerill, by using offensive language, when addressing representatives of the media after the match.'

Castrogiovanni sought out journalists after the match and unleashed a foul-mouthed assault rant regarding Cockerill, who had claimed the former Italy prop swapped the Tigers for Toulon in 2013 for financial reasons.

'I thought f****** Leicester were f****** amateur. I never want to speak with Cockers any more. I just don't like ****s," said Castrogiovanni, who spent seven years at Welford Road.

Armitage, who has a chequered disciplinary history, is alleged to have verbally abused spectators as he departed the pitch for half-time.
