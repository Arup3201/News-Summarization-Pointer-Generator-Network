A teenager is 'lucky to be alive' after he was filmed risking his life by climbing out of the window of a moving train and clinging on to the carriage. 

The train was packed with teenagers who were making their way home from the under-18 Good Life music festival, in Melbourne, Australia.

The shirtless, boy is captured climbing out of the train and holding on to the side while other commuters look on in shock.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The teenager is seen holding to the train roof with one hand and giving the thumbs up to his friends sat inside. They were making their way back from the under-18 Good Life music festival in Melbourne, Australia

Psychologist Sandy Rae said this behaviour was not uncommon among teenagers and said he lucky to be alive

During the stunt he holds on with just one hand and gives people the thumbs up.

At one point he even shows people the middle finger who shout abuse at him and tell him to get down. 

To get back in, he has to push himself against the moving train to swing his legs into the carriage.

Psychologist Sandy Rae said this behaviour was not uncommon among teenagers and said he lucky to be alive.

Precarious: The boy holds on for dear life as the train hurtles along with passengers watching on in shock

She said: 'He could have been crushed by an oncoming train or lost his balance.

'And more surprisingly none of his friends came to rescue him or pull him back into the carriage.'

It not known if the boy has been arrested following the stunt which would normally carry with it a penalty fine.

Last January, James Wilkson, 16, from Melbourne was killed when he hit overhead power lines while riding the roof of a train in the city.

His father said at the time he hoped the death of his son would serve as a warning to other young people wanting to attempt 'train surfing'.
