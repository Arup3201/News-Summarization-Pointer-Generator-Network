After a rookie season in which he saw limited game time and suffered difficult losses in his only two starts, Johnny Manziel was no doubt hoping to step out of the spotlight following the Cleveland Browns final game of the season on Sunday.

That was not to be however, as after partying until well past midnight last Friday, Manziel, who is suffering from an injured hamstring, skipped out on a Saturday morning team treatment session because he overslept, and in turn was fined by the Browns.

Manziel was quick to apologize to the team for his behavior, saying; 'It’s about being accountable . . . instead of looking like a jackass.'

And while his season may have been over, many believed Manziel would still tone things down for a bit in the wake of this controversy, which made it all the more shocking when he was spotted partying at FDR Lounge at the Delano in Miami on Monday night alongside the likes of LeBron James and Ryan Phillippe, and then seen chugging champagne straight from the bottle on Wednesday afternoon with girlfriend Colleen Crowley and some buddies poolside at the Delano.

This as Manziel's drinking and partying has come under fire by some in the NFL and sports world

Now, some in the sports world, chief among them columnist Skip Bayless, are starting to suggest that the Heisman Trophy winner needs to get help for his drinking.

Appearing on ESPN’s First Take earlier this week, Bayless, a noted supporter of Manziel, did not mince words as he made it very clear that in his opinion the former college star needed to deal with his drinking.

'My concern, I repeatedly said, was if Johnny continues to demonstrate that he has a problem with alcohol, and a problem with alcohol leading to partying and all that that entails, then I’m going to be out,' said Bayless.

'In talking to people in and around the Cleveland Browns, I believe Johnny Manziel continues to have a problem with alcohol. And I believe ... that it is time for Johnny to get some help. He continues to lie to his executives, to his coaches, to his teammates, to the media, and most of all, he continues to lie to himself.'

He then said he would label Manziel an 'alcoholic.'

Manziel was known for his partying while at Texas A&M, but said he was a changed man during the 2014 NFL Draft, noting that he had 'grown up,' before being selected 22nd overall by Cleveland.

Just days into his training with the Browns however, the local press began calling him out on his partying, which they cited as the major reason for his poor performance on the field.

A source told Cleveland.com at the time; 'Team officials had bought into Manziel's pre-draft promises to tone down the partying and leave his frat-boy lifestyle back in College Station, Texas, and they've been stunned by his non-stop antics.'

Manziel was considered one of the best quarterbacks in the country, alongside A. J. McCarron, when he played at Texas A&M

Also causing some alarm before the season even began was a photo snapped of Manziel and later posted to Instagram that showed the footballer at a bar in the process of tightly rolling up a dollar bill while standing over a sink counter, leading some to suggest that he might have been snorting cocaine.

Browns head coach Mike Pettine spoke to Manziel soon after the problematic photo was posted, a photo that could have led to an inquiry or a drug test from the NFL, and said he felt that things were back on track and that Manziel was focused on football once again.

There was also an odd incident during the regular season when he got into a fight with a fan in the lobby of his apartment building, and while alcohol seems to have played a role in the incident, it was the fan who was inebriated, not Manziel. 

Manziel makes no effort to hide his love for a good time with friends

A report in 2013 said that Manziel did once seek help for drinking, but he denied it was true

Manziel said he has never sought counseling for alcohol abuse or anger management 

It should be noted that a very thorough and detailed story published by ESPN in 2013 said that after his arrest for disorderly conduct back in 2012 and while still at college, Manziel did seek help for an alcohol problem, seeing an counselor for six or seven weeks.

Manziel would later claim this report was false, and that he had never seen a counselor for anger management or for alcohol abuse while in college.

As for his future with the Browns, that is a little unclear.

In light of recent incidents, some are saying that the Browns should drop Manziel for his 'lack of professionalism'

Training for next season won't begin until the summer, but already some, including ESPN's Pat McManamon, have called on the Browns to fire Manziel after last weekend's incident, saying he and fellow player Josh Gordon have a 'complete lack of professionalism.'

Gordon was also out with Manziel and showed up late for the team walk-through, an offense that carried a far stiffer punishment for the starter as he was forced to sit out the final game of the season.

Crowley is still in college at Texas Christian University

Manziel apologized for the incident this past weekend with the Browns, but not responded to any of his critics

Currently, Manziel has a four year contract with the Browns worth about $8.25 million

The 22-year-old also has some of the most coveted, and lucrative, endorsement deals in the sports world with, among others, Nike, McDonald's, MusclePharm, and Snickers

Manziel has not responded to any of his critics in the wake of this scandal, though he did write on Twitter Monday as the off-season officially began; 'There's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success.'

For the time being, Manziel just seems to be enjoying his week at the Delano, ringing in the New Year with a performance by J. Cole at the club.

An Instagram video was posted of Manziel rapping to Cole's lyrics during his set.
