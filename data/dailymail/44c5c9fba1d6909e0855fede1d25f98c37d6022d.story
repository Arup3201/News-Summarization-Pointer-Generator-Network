Mothers are made to feel 'marginalised and ashamed' when they breastfeed in public, according to an international study.

Researchers also found that many new mothers are put off breastfeeding by negative comments from health workers.

Mothers reported being stared at or tutted at and felt as if they were seen as 'hippies' or 'weirdos'. Others said they wanted to breastfeed after 12 months but feared public disapproval.

Negative emotions are also common for new mothers trying to breastfeed in hospital soon after giving birth due to staff actions and comments, the study found.

Other findings included:

* mothers fear if they breastfeed in public they may be seen as 'hippies, weirdoes or naturalists' while others reported being stared at, frowned at and tutted at

* new mothers in hospital wanting help with feeding were asked to 'stop buzzing' and some were told their baby was 'too lazy' or 'too eager'

* others felt distressed by midwives objectifying and handling their breasts in front of their partners

* experiences of shame over baby feeding mean the process can be seen as 'effectively a disease or analagous to one'

* a family history of breastfeeding encouraged women to do the same but negative family comments put women off

* women breastfeeding children of 12 months or older felt 'uncomfortable' due to being seen as 'not normal'

Dr Gill Thomson, of the Maternal and Infant Nutrition and Nurture Unit at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, led the study, which also involved researchers in Germany and Sweden.

The research, published online in Maternal & Child Nutrition, involved interviews and focus groups with 63 women from a range of backgrounds in two primary care trust areas in North West England.

Two thirds of the women were breastfeeding at the time they were interviewed but the duration of breastfeeding varied from a few days to more than 12 months and only a small minority said they breastfed in public.

Breastfeeding is known to have important health benefits for mothers and babies.

According to the NHS, breastfed babies have less chance of diarrhoea and vomiting, fewer chest and ear infections and less chance of becoming obese, while women who breastfeed have a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

But only 46 per cent of UK mothers exclusively breastfeed their child at one week old compared to 83 per cent in Sweden, the authors state.

At six months, less than one per cent of UK mothers are still exclusively breastfeeding compared to 11 per cent in Sweden.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of a child's life – and continuing to provide breast milk until a child is two or beyond.

The authors wrote: 'The findings of this paper highlight how breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women may experience judgement and condemnation in interactions with health professionals as well as within community contexts, leading to feelings of failure, inadequacy and isolation.'

They added that the findings 'emphasise how breastfeeding women feel equally marginalised and shamed [as non-breastfeeding women], as expressed in their social and clinical encounters and fears about breastfeeding in public spaces.

'As poor care and negative emotions are experienced by women irrespective of their infant feeding methods, these insights highlight how breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women require targeted needs-led support throughout the perinatal period.'

Many of the women felt 'out of control' due to poor information about feeding choices or lack of support.

New infant feeding groups that put breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women together could help provide better support, the authors argued.

The research was part of an evaluation of the UNICEF Community Baby Friendly Implementation project, which accredits maternity and community facilities that adopt internationally recognised standards of best practice.

Janet Fyle, professional policy advisor at the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'At the end of the antenatal period the health service dumps women and sends them home with very little support, even though they've been told that breastfeeding is best.

'A lot of women are crying out for help and that's one of the reasons they give up breastfeeding.

'There's a shortage of midwives and if they have to prioritise they will prioritise the women in labour, not the ones who have already given birth.'

She said 'outward signs' from society that breastfeeding in public is not welcomed were also a problem.

'If you go to a major store in the UK they put the breastfeeding area in a toilet. Even in an NHS trust a woman has been asked to stop breastfeeding.'
