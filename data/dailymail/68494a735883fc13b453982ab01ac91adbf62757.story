She might be scaling back her public duties, lending the Royal plane to Prince Charles so he can represent the monarchy in Sri Lanka in November, but Queen Elizabeth II proved she is still as regal as ever at today's State Opening of Parliament.

Wearing the white Angela Kelly dress she chose for her Jubilee portrait, accompanied by Prince Philip in his
 Royal Navy Uniform, and weighed down with heavy ceremonial 
crowns and robes (as well as Queen Victoria's pearl earrings and Diamond Jubilee
 necklace), the Queen unveiled 20 Bills which the coalition hopes to 
pass into law in the next year.

In line with Her Majesty's decision to give her son and heir a bigger role as 'co-head' of the Royal family, Prince Charles attended the event - a tradition which dates back to the 16th century -  for the first time in 17 years. This year, for the first time, he was joined by his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

Her Majesty has officially opened 
Parliament 60 times, every year since her accession - except in 1959 and 1963, 
when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, 
respectively, and in 2011, when it was cancelled by the government.

And
 each year sees her wearing two of the most important pieces in the 
Royal collection of jewels and clothing, both also worn for the 
coronation: the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of the State.

The Imperial State Crown - which includes 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds, and 5 rubies, and weighs 2lb - is the most famous of all the British crowns, and was re-made for the coronation of the Queen's father, King George VI, in 
1937.

Other than the coronation, the only time the reigning monarch wears it is for the State Opening of Parliament. When not used it is kept with the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.

According to the official website of the British Monarchy: 'Set with over 3,000 gems, the stones were all transferred 
from the old Imperial Crown, which had been re-made on a number of 
occasions since the 17th century, most recently for Queen Victoria in 
1838.

'This crown incorporates many famous gemstones, including the 
diamond known as the Second Star of Africa (the second largest stone cut
 from the celebrated Cullinan Diamond), the Black Prince's Ruby, the 
Stuart Sapphire, St Edward’s Sapphire and Queen Elizabeth's Pearls.'

The Queen on her way to the Palace of Westminister this morning

It has been announce that Prince Charles - attending the ceremony for the first time in 17 years, and for the first time with his wife Camilla Duchess of Cornwall - will take on a bigger role as 'co-head' of the Royal family

The 18ft-long Robe of the State is an ermine cape with crimson velvet train, weighing some 15lb.

The current one was crafted by Ede and Ravenscroft in 1952 for the Queen's coronation, and the company's ledger reads: 'Parliamentary robe for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in the best quality hand made crimson velvet, trimmed with gold lace in the traditional manner and lined throughout with finest coronation ermine.'

But the Queen does not begin today's event wearing these items.

Initially, during her horse-drawn procession from the palace to the Palace of Westminster with the Duke of Edinburgh, she wears the simpler George IV State Diadem.

Prince Philip wears his Royal Navy uniform, as will the Prince of Wales who will join them with, for the first time, his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.

The Royal party follows the coach carrying the ceremonial regalia: the Imperial State Crown, the sword of state and the cap of maintenance, all symbols of the Monarch's authority.

The coaches travel into Westminster through the Sovereign's Entrance, and crown then goes into the robing room, where it is fitted on the Queen, along with the Robe of State.

The Imperial State Crown weighs over 2lb and contains 3,000 gems

Imperial State Crown

Imperial State Crown: 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires, 11 emeralds & 5 rubies.

The Imperial State Crown was originally made for Queen Victoria’s coronation in 1838 by Rundell, Bridge & Rundell, the Crown Jewellers. 

At that time the Stuart Sapphire was in the front. Another sapphire (still in the Jewel House) was at the back. 

The Second Star of Africa (Cullinan II) replaced the Stuart Sapphire (which was moved to the back) in 1909.

The crown was replicated for King George VI by Garrards in 1937 and the arches were lowered for Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

The crown is of traditional design of crosses pattée and fleurs-de-lis with four half-arches of oak-leaf design set with pearls and diamonds.

It is fitted with a purple velvet cap turned over with ermine and is mounted in gold and silver.

It weighs 2 pounds 13 ounces and is set with over 3000 precious stones. 

The more important are St Edward’s Sapphire, set in the cross pattée above the monde, Queen Elizabeth’s Pearls suspended below the monde, the Black Princes Ruby (a spinel) in the cross pattée above the band, the Second Star of Africa in the front of the band and the Stuart Sapphire in the band at the back. 

Apart from a coronation, when it is used for the return from Westminster Abbey, the Imperial State Crown is worn by Queen Elizabeth II for her speech at the annual State Opening of Parliament.

Robe of the State

The Robe of the State is 18ft in length, weighs 15lb and has to be carried by helpers

The robe that is worn at the Coronation on entry to the Abbey, is also worn at the State Openings of Parliament.

It consists of an ermine cape and a long crimson velvet train lined with further ermine and decorated with two rows of hand-made embroidered gold lace and gold filigree work.

It weighs 15lb and measures 18ft in length.

It is fitted onto the monarch's shoulders in the Robing Room inside the Palace of Westminster and then carried by sewn-in fabric hooks while she walks.

The Robe went on public display for the first time as part of an exhibition at the summer opening of Buckingham Palace in 2010.

The robe was made by Messrs. Ede and Ravenscroft of Chancery Lane, London.

The velvet had been hand-woven by Warners of Braintree, Essex, from silk supplied by Lady Hart Dyke of Lullington Castle.

George IV State Diadem is worn on the journey from Buckingham Palace to Westminster

George IV State Diadem

This was made by Rundell, Bridge & Rundell for the coronation of George IV to encircle the King’s velvet Cap of Estate, which he wore in procession to Westminster Abbey. 

As the Privy Council ruled that the crown could not bear roses, shamrocks and thistles, as the King wished, rather than the traditional fleurs-de-lis, the national symbols were instead incorporated in the Diadem. 

The diamonds hired for George IV’s coronation were later replaced by permanently-set jewels. 

Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II each wore the Diadem for the processions to their coronations. 

The Queen also wears the Diadem when she travels to and from the State Opening of Parliaments and it features on all denominational postage stamps.

It is composed of four diamond pavé-set crosses pattée alternating with four bouquets of rose, shamrock and thistle. 

The front cross pattée is set with a 4-carat canary-coloured diamond.  There are 1333 diamonds weighing 325.75 carats and 169 pearls. 

The diamond scrollwork band was remounted for Queen Alexandra in 1902. 

In 1991, The Queen agreed to allow the Diadem to be displayed with the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London.
