These are the fascinating signed handprints of famous names from the 1920s including Albert Einstein.

The incredible collection also includes actress and singer Marlene Deitrich, composers Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky and filmmaker Fritz Lang.

They were collected by German palmist Marianne Raschig who spent 60 years taking more than 2,000 handprints of around 1,000 leading artists, actors, scientists, musicians and writers in Berlin.

Revealing: The handprint of renowned scientist Albert Einstein. Does this give any clue to where his genius came from?

Leading lights: Marianne Raschig collected prints from famous names of her time including Albert Einstein and Marlene Dietrich

Hands on: The palm prints of Fritz Lang the film director who was one of the leading lights of German Expressionism

Illuminating: The handprint of actress Louise Brooks who was more famous for her bobbed haircut in the 1920s

Raschig collected the handprints between the 1870s and 1930s for a study into what the lines and shapes of hands could reveal about a person's character.

Palm readers believe that every person's hands has a series of 'lines' and 'mounts' which reveal their personality traits and even predict their future.

Studies of Einstein's prints have suggested they show he was an independent thinker and possibly suffered from Asperger's Syndrome.

Telling: Nobel Prize-winning novelist Thomas Mann was one of the leading names in literature of the day when he gave this handprint

Researchers have suggested that people with that people with autism often have a 2D:4D ratio (the distance between the index finger and ring finger) of 0.94mm or less.

Einstein's is said to have been 0.93.

Each of the lifesized handprints is signed and dated by its subject, then stamped with a mark reading 'M. Raschig's Handarchiv.'

Raschig published her study in a 1933 book Hand und Persvnlichkeit (Hand and Personality) which is still used today.

The rare collection is tipped to fetch upwards of £90,000 when it goes under the hammer.

Einstein's handprints, featuring both hands, are expected to sell for £15,000 on their own.

A small collection of 52 handprints auctioned in New York in 2006 sold for £64,000.

The handprints are being sold by a member of Raschig's family who bought the collection 30 years ago.

Dr
Simon Maguire, books and manuscripts expert at auctioneers Sotheby's, 
said: 'Marianne Raschig was a rather serious German lady who conducted a
study of handprints in the early 1930s of the movers and shakers of 
culture in Berlin at the time.

'She
spent around years collecting handprints from more than 1,000 people. 
She was interested in how the lines on people's hands revealed 
characteristics about them.

'It was a very significant and influential study, and one that is still being referred to now, 80 years on.

'Never
before had there been such a comprehensive study of handprints 
conducted. Her subjects would put their inked hands onto paper and then 
sign and date the print.

Enlightening: Actress and singer Marlene Dietrich, left, and composer Richard Strauss, right, are included in the collection

Hands of a genius: These prints were created by physicist Max Planck who went on to win a Nobel Prize for his work

'Einstein's prints showed very strong head and lifelines, and Raschig devoted several pages to her analysis of the great scientist.

'In some cases Raschig would outline the prints in pencil to show where parts of the hand had lifted off the paper.

'There has never been such a comprehensive collection of handprints at auction.'

The handprints will be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on June 5 and 6.
