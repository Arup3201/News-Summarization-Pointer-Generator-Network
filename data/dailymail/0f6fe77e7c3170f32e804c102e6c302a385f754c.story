Basketball star Stephen Jackson sprained his ankle after he crashed into a sideline waitress serving food close to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

The San Antonio Spurs player had been playing for just three minutes when the unfortunate incident happened during his team's game against the New York Knicks on Thursday night.

He had just missed a shot when he stepped backwards and collided with the waitress, twisting his ankle as he fell awkwardly.

Sources reported that the waitress had been serving the Mayor, who was sitting right beside the court, but this is unconfirmed.

The 70-year-old Mayor was seen eating popcorn shortly after the incident at the NBA.

Jackson's team went on to lose the match at the NBA 100-83.

The player had only recently returned to play following nearly a month off with a broken little finger, according to an American news website, which said he was unavailable for comment after the game.

Mayor Bloomberg was in the news again yesterday after speaking out on the issue of gun violence.

He told Late Night With Jimmy Fallon: 'There's just too many guns in the world and certainly in this country, and we've just got to do something about it'.
