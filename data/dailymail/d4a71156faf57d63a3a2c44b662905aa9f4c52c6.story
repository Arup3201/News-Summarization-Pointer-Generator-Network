On the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings, new images have been released comparing the chaos to nearly a year later, as the city gears up to host the race again.

Brothers Tamerlan and Dzokhar Tsarnaev are believed to be the two responsible for detonating two pressure-cooker bombs at the finish line on April 15, 2014, killing three and injuring more than 260.

Those blasts sent the thousands gathered at the race into turmoil and police on a days-long chase to find the culprits.

But nearly a year later, Bostonians are pictured casually walking around the downtown areas once the scene of a massacre.

In one image, grand stands and barriers have already been erected on Boylston Street as race officials have already begun setting up for the race set for April 21 - Patriot's Day.

Local authorities have been working tirelessly for months to insure this race will proceed safely, first by doubling the police presence on the route to 3,500. One hundred additional security cameras have also been added to the route, and officials are working to co-op the security cameras of local business owners as well.

Unnumbered runners, known as 'bandits', have been banned from his year's race for security but also because there are 9,000 extra runners bringing the total competing to 36,000. About 1million spectators are expected to turn out for the event.

Spectators are also being told not to bring backpacks, rolling bags, coolers or other large items which will be subject to search.

Instead officials are recommending personal items be stored in clear plastic bags.

Spectators are also being encouraged to report any suspicious behavior.Â 

Still, officials don't want to change the race too much.

Officials and local authorities have spent months preparing for the 2014 race and providing new security measures. Above, a Boston Police officer at the finish line of the marathon on April 14, 2014

Safe: There will more than 100 additional surveillance cameras on the race route as well as double the police force

'We are confident that the overall experience of runners and spectators will not be impacted, and that all will enjoy a fun, festive and family-oriented day,' Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, said.

So far, officials say there has been 'no specific intelligence indicating there is a threat to this year's marathon.'

'At this point, we don't have one, nor do we anticipate it,' Kieran Ramsety, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office said.
