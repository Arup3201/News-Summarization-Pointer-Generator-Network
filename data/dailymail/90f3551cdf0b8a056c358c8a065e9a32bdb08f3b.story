A Maryland couple are suing the National Aquarium after they claim a dolphin bonked their young son on the head with a pool toy.

Ashley Lehman and Jeremy Benedict attended a dolphin show at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland, in April 2013 with their son Aiden.

After the show, a trainer tossed a pool toy into the pool - and the dolphin responded by launching at spectators.

The parents say that the dolphin injured their young son when a trainer threw him a toy. Pictured here are bottlenose dolphins at the National Aquarium in Baltimore

The parents claims little Aiden was bonked on the head, according to Courthouse News Service.

'After the show ended, plaintiffs began to leave and were standing near the dolphin pool, when an employee of defendant's provided a dolphin in the dolphin pool with a white plastic toy,' their lawsuit says.

'The dolphin pushed the white plastic toy out of the pool, striking the minor in the head, causing him injuries.'

Ms Lehman and Mr Benedict are suing the National Aquarium for $16,454 in Baltimore City Court.

They say they are owed damages for negligence and pain and suffering.

The Aquarium did not return a call seeing comment Wednesday.
