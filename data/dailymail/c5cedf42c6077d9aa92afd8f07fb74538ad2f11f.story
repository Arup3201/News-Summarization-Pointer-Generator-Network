A horrifically burned kitten that was doused in petrol and set on fire has found a new loving family after making a miraculous recovery.

The tiny cat, called Justin, was lucky to be alive after the cruel attack which left him without ears when he was just five weeks old.

Justin, who weighed just one pound, suffered second and third degree burns to his back and head and was brought to vets in New Jersey, USA, when a quick-thinking passer-by spotted the fireball.

'But after a lot of love and care he improved bit by bit and we took him home to help look after him.

'He was cared for by us - his original foster family - but it was time for him to find a new permanent family.

'And that's where Melody came in - she was perfect and I'm sure she will take fantastic care of him.'

'Everyone here is so grateful for all the new friends we have made because of Justin, and the continued support of Animal Alliance is appreciated beyond measure.'

Bedtime story: The Humane Society of the United States have offered a reward to anyone with information that may lead to the capture of those who committed the cruel act

Damaris Alcala, who saved Justin by smothering the flames with his jacket, found him burning in the street after a string of attacks against animals in the New Jersey state.

Damaris said: 'He was already crying when I picked him up but when I moved him in the back he started screaming.'

Following the rescue, Sarah Speed from the Humane Society of the United States said: 'This is the latest in a disturbing string of animals apparently being intentionally lit on fire.

'This depraved act of cruelty will not be tolerated, and we hope this reward will encourage anyone with information to come forward and help bring a perpetrator to justice.

'The young cat's ears will have to be mostly removed as a result of the incident and he will have permanent bald spots but it is hoped he will make a full recovery.'
