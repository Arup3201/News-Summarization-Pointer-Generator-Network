London and the south east are set to benefit the most from a forecast rise in Brits booking staycations, according to a survey.

Overall spending by UK domestic tourists, including shopping, will surge by 25 per cent to more than £108bn by 2017, the study from Barclays predicts.

But as much as 16.2 per cent of this total spending will be in London, with 12.9 per cent being in the south east and 12.2 per cent in south west England.

In contrast, just 3 per cent of the total spending is likely to be in north east England and only 5.8 per cent in the West Midlands.

Barclays said the hospitality and leisure sectors will benefit most from the trend towards staycationing, with spending in pubs and restaurants by domestic tourists forecast to rise by 26 per cent to £37bn as more people dine out.

Hotels and B&B spending is set to increase by 25 per cent to £17bn, with leisure attractions going up 27 per cent to £15bn and shopping rising 23 per cent to £15.6bn.

Mike Saul, head of hospitality and leisure at Barclays, said: 'The economy is improving and confidence is certainly growing.

'And while this will lead to a gradual rise in the number of consumers looking to holiday abroad again, it is unlikely to precipitate a return to the holidaying habits we were seeing prior to the downturn.'

'With domestic tourism set to be big business for the UK's hospitality and retail sectors, those with a clearly targeted strategy are set to benefit.'
