As the star winger of Manchester United, he's arguably one of the most able-bodied men in the country.

Which begs the question, why was Luis Nani parking his Chevy in a disabled parking bay?

The fleet-footed 26-year-old was photographed pulling his bright red Chevrolet Camaro into the spot, which was clearly marked by a sign saying 'Disabled Badge Holders Only'.

The disabled bay is meant to be for 
those with official permits, and are designed to provide ease of access 
for motorists with disabilities.

By parking in the space, Nani deprived a Blue Badge holder from potentially parking in the spot.

But that didn't deter the Portugese player, who signed from Sporting Lisbon in 2007 in a deal worth £20million, leaving his car there for 20 minutes while he went out in Wilmslow, Cheshire.

Wearing a pair of dark blue jeans, a cream jacket and spotless black trainers, the footballer carried a bunch of letters as he climbed out of his sports car, which can fetch a price tag starting at £35,000.

The player, who has made more than 200 appearances for United, is reportedly earning £130,000 a year.

The average price for a car parking spot in Wilmslow for up to an hour costs a motorist an affordable 60 pence, according to Cheshire East council's figures.

Disabled badge holders only: A sign stated that the bay was designated just for those with badges

Manchester United's Nani has become a star player of the team - and is reportedly earning £130,000 a week

The average price of an annual parking 
space pass in Wilmslow is £886.67 - meaning with a year's estimated 
salary before tax, the player could afford to buy 7,629 annual passes.

Those who are automatically provided with a Blue Badge in Cheshire are those who receive the higher rate of the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance, people who are registered blind or severely sight impaired and residents who receive War Pensioners' Mobility Supplement.

Others who are automatically entitles to the badge are people who been awarded a benefit under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme and have been assessed and certified by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency as having a permanent and substantial disability which causes inability to walk or very considerable difficulty in walking.

Those with a severe disability in both arms who regularly drive a vehicle but cannot operate or have considerable difficulty in operating all or some types of parking meter also receive the badge - and would have been entitled to use the space.

Badge holders are entitled to park in other spots if their designated spaces are full, Cheshire East council states.

It is unclear whether the footballer didn't spot the sign, or couldn't find another parking space within the car park.

Manchester United have been contacted by the Mail Online for a response.
