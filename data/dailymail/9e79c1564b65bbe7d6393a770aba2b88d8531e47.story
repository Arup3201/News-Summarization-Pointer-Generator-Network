A two-year-old girl died in hospital because doctors refused to immediately carry out a brain scan, her parents told an inquest yesterday.

Alice Mason had successfully undergone treatment for a brain tumour two months before she was taken to Kingston Hospital in Surrey, with vomiting and fever. She died one week later.

Rosalind and Gareth Mason alleged that staff refused to carry out scans on their daughter, deeming them unnecessary. They claimed nine chances to act on her symptoms were missed.

By the time tests were finally carried out it was too late to save her, West London Coroner's Court heard. Alice died on March 31 2011, from irreversible brain damage caused by water on the brain.

Her parents, who are now suing the hospital, said the last time she was conscious she was clutching her head and crawling up and down her hospital bed in pain.

Former City trader Mrs Mason, 46, of Wimbledon, south-west London, who is married to education expert Mr Mason, said: ‘It is not just that she died - the question is, could she have been saved?’

The inquest into Alice's death yesterday heard from junior doctor Dr Sharon Jheeta, who cared for her for two days, and said she was not initially told of the need for a brain scan.

Dr Jheeta told the hearing: ‘I was under the impression this was a follow up scan rather than an emergency. I hadn't even heard about it until two days after Alice had been admitted.’

The doctor, who had been working on the ward for two weeks, said her only contact with Alice was to write up the consultant's notes.

Initially doctors thought the toddler 
was suffering from an infection, prescribed her antibiotics and 
monitored her every four hours.

Jeremy Hyam, representing the Mason family, said the girl’s symptoms suggested she could have a neurological condition.

‘Could that have been a differential diagnosis to infection?’ he asked Dr Jheeta. She replied: ‘Yes, but that was not the top diagnosis from the team.’

'It is not just that she died - the question is, could she have been saved?'

Alice's parents claim Dr Jheeta refused to order the scan, even though she claimed she did not have the authority to do so.

And they alleged that when they asked her what criteria Alice would have to meet to get the scan, the doctor refused to answer their questions.

Disputing their version of events, the doctor said she could not recall such an incident, adding: ‘That doesn't sound like something I would do. I would have been quite happy to tell them.’

She said: ‘It was not my clinical decision. I wrote down notes as my consultant dictated. The only thing I would have said is my consultant doesn't believe the scan was needed at this time.’

The court was told that Mrs Mason was so upset by staff at the hospital that she had to leave on one occasion. The inquest was adjourned until October.
