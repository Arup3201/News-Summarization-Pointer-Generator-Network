Landing at what would eventually become known as Turkey's Anzac Cove in 1915, little did many of these men know that their sacrifices would still be commemorated almost a century later.

These extraordinary pictures were today released to mark the 98th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings on Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand.

The national remembrance day marks the anniversary of the first major military action by Australia and New Zealand during the First World War in 1915.

Landing: Allied troops at what would eventually become known Anzac Cove in the Gallipoli Peninsula in 1915. From this point many Anzac forces were sent into battle along the ridges of the area. Soldiers can be seen looking up at the hillside they would never capture (bottom right)

Cannon in place: Troops landing at what would eventually become known as Anzac Cove in the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915

Building: The landing pier constructed by the Allies at Gallipoli in 1915. The background to the Gallipoli landings was one of deadlock on the Western Front

It also now more broadly commemorates 
all those who served and died in military operations in which the two 
countries have been involved.

The
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac) fought alongside their 
British, French and other allies at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War
One.

The 
background to the Gallipoli landings was one of deadlock on the Western 
Front in 1915, when the British hoped to capture Constantinople.

The
Russians were under threat from the Turks in the Caucasus and needed 
help, so the British decided to bombard and try to capture Gallipoli.

Located on the western coast of the 
Dardanelles, the British hoped by eventually getting to Constantinople 
that they would link up with the Russians.

The
intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war. A naval 
attack began on February 19 but it was called off after three 
battleships were sunk.

Then 
by the time of another landing on April 25, the Turks had been given 
time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies 
sixfold.

Australian and New 
Zealand troops won a bridgehead at Anzac Cove as the British aimed to 
land at five points in Cape Helles - but only managed three.

The British still required reinforcements in these areas and the Turkish were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves.

A standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions, and the campaign was eventually ended by the War Council in winter 1915.

The invasion had been intended to 
knock Turkey out of the war, but in the end it only gave the Russians 
some breathing space from the Turks.

Turkey
lost around 300,000 men and the Allies had 214,000 killed - more than 
8,000 of whom were Australian soldiers, in a disastrous campaign.

Anzac
Cove became a focus for Australian pride after forces were stuck 
there in squalid conditions for eight months, defending the area from the Turks.

The Anzac
soldiers who arrived on the 
narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and 
almost daily shelling.

Gathering: Crowds of people look on after the annual Anzac Day march at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne

Streets: Dozens of participants took to the street in the annual parade in 
the most populous city in Australia

In silence: People pay their respects at the Anzac Cenotaph during the Anzac Dawn Service at the Martin Place Cenotaph today in Sydney, Australia

Stories to tell: Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard talks with former P.O.W Sidney King at the Aznac Dawn Service today in Townsville, Australia

Memorial: A member of the catafalque party stands at rest during the Dawn Service today in Townsville, marked by veterans, dignitaries and members of the public

At the height of the fighting during 
the landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were 
stained red with blood at one point 50 metres out.

Fierce resistance from the 
under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning 
spelt disaster for the campaign.

Among those who suffered the greatest
losses were the Anzacs Australian and New Zealand Army Corps who made 
the first landings, swept by an unexpected current to a narrow cove 
rather than the wide beaches the planners intended.

War
historian Charles Bean wrote: ‘That strongly marked and definite entity,
the Anzac tradition, had, from the first morning, been partly created 
here’.

But despite the toll in human life, the 
campaign is seen as a landmark in the formation of national 
consciousness in the two countries.

The 25th of April was officially named Anzac Day in 1916.

And
today tens of thousands of people across the world attended dawn 
services across the world as the centenary of Gallipoli nears.

They stood motionless in the dark to remember their fallen countrymen and women as they marked the anniversary of the landing.
