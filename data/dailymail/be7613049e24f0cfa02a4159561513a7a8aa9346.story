Talk about a photo finish...

A Budweiser Clydesdale was born on Super Bowl Sunday, just moments before the company's 'Lost Dog' commercial aired during NBC's broadcast of the game.

Arizona, a filly, was born at Warm Springs Ranch in Boonville, Missouri, the 340-acre farm where the beer company raises, trains and cares for all of its horses.

Warm Springs Ranch has ten pastures, a veterinary lab and a 25,000-square-foot breeding facility

If the horse had been a colt, it's possible he would have been named after the Super Bowl MVP, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. 

Instead, the ranch opted to name the foal after the state that hosted the big game. 

Arizona and both of her parents are healthy and she will begin training with the other animal members of the Anheuser-Busch family this spring, KSDK reported. 

The ranch was established in 2008 and it opened for tours the following year. 

Warm Springs has ten pastures, a veterinary lab and a 25,000-square-foot breeding facility.

John Soto, breeding farm supervisor, said: 'What we're trying to raise is the perfect Budweiser Clydesdale, which is the bay in color, the four white legs, the dark mane and tail.'

All of Budweiser's signature horses are raised, trained and cared for at the 340-acre ranch 

Budweiser's 'Lost Dog' ad had been viewed nearly 42 million times before the Super Bowl even started 

The ad featured The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) being covered by musical group Sleeping at Last

The commercial that aired just after Arizona's birth shows a lost puppy attempting to get back home with the help of some Clydesdales.

The spot is set to The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) being covered by Sleeping at Last.

Before the game even started the ad had already been watched nearly 42 million times.

Brands paid up to a record $4.5million for 30 seconds during the NFL's championship game. 

The Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 and captured their fourth Super Bowl victory.
