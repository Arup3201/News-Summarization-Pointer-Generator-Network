No deal has yet been agreed for Alberto Moreno to join Liverpool, says Sevilla's club president Jose Castro.

The young left-back has been linked with a move to Merseyside all summer as Brendan Rodgers looks to strengthen his defensive options, but with the start of the Premier League fast approaching, a completed move seems to still be some way away. 

'There have been negotiations [for Moreno], eight or 10 days ago, but there has been no agreement and nor is there today,' Castro told the club's official website on Monday.

Target: The Spanish left-back (left) has been chased by Liverpool all summer

'If Liverpool's offer is suitable he will leave. If not, he'll stay and nothing will happen, absolutely nothing. We'll be at ease.'

The left-back role became something of a problem position for Liverpool last season, with regular choice Jose Enrique out for the entire campaign, and Aly Cissokho failing to impress on loan.

Glen Johnson was used there intermittently, before Jon Flanagan came in and made the position his own. 

Rodgers is still looking to add to his seven summer signings so far, as he looks to bolster his squad ahead of upcoming challenge of balancing Premier League and Champions League football.

Meanwhile, Moreno is set to feature for Sevilla in the Super Cup against Real Madrid at the Millenium Stadium in Cardiff on Tuesday.

‘Yes (they are interested). Tomorrow [Tuesday] he will play for us, but I don’t know if it will happen with Liverpool.’
