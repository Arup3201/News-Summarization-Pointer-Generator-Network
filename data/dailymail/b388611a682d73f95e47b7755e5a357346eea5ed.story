They've spent almost 40 years together, he's been asking her to marry him for 30, and she's turned him down every time. Until now.

When retired miner Chris Green from Tamworth, Staffordshire, dropped down onto one knee in front of his partner Ann Turner, 72, at his 75th birthday party in the local pub, he received the best present he could have hoped for when she said 'I will' to his proposal.

And she will finally stand up beside him and say 'I do' in front of their family and friends at St Matthew's Church, Harlaston, on Friday.

An ecstatic Chris said: 'We've been engaged for 30 years or more. I've asked her on countless occasions to be my bride and each time she turned me down. I thought she'd never say the words "I will".'

Ann, who worked for social services as a carer for the elderly as well as helping cancer sufferers, said Chris's birthday bid came at the end of a 'tough year' for both of them.

She added: 'It's been a difficult 12 months for the family with a number of our children fighting heart disease and cancer. We wanted it right for them.

'I suppose it's made me really focus on the living years. While I've always been happy to feel that we were married - except on paper - it made me realise the children really wanted us to be a proper couple, as in man and wife.

'We have certainly loved, honoured and obeyed each other these last 40 years.'

Ann said: 'It's been a difficult 12 months for the family with a number of our children fighting heart disease and cancer. We wanted it right for them'

She added: 'We're really looking forward to our big day now. All the family will be there and they're over the moon about it.'

The two met more than 40 years ago at Alrewas British Legion Club, Staffordshire.

'I was out with my four young children whose ages ranged between four and 13 at the time,' explained Ann. 'It was a case of literally bumping into Chris at one of his regular haunts.'

The two hit it off straight away but it was two years before Ann, who lived in Yoxall, moved into the widower's home at Manor Lane, Harlaston.

'We've been living "over the brush" for 38 years now,' she laughed.
