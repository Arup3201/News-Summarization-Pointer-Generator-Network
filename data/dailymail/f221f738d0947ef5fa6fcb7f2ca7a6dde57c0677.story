Bernie Mulligan lost the use of her legs after being crushed by a car and has now launched an aromatherapy business after crediting it with helping her walk again

A woman who lost the use of her legs after being crushed by a car has launched a homemade aromatherapy business after crediting essential oils will helping her get back on her feet.

Bernie Mulligan, 46, spent months in hospital after a driverless care rolled down a hill and trapped her against a gate post as she went to collect two of her daughters from school.

Ms Mulligan lost the muscle in her legs because she spent so long in bed and when she tried to walk again, she collapsed.

However, she says massages by her friend, and now business partner, Beverley Higham produced revolutionary results.

Ms Mulligan, a mother of three, said they started an online business because doctors were so impressed by her speedy recovery.

She said her achievement will inspire other people who have been injured or ill.

The accident in 2001 left her with crushed ribs and spine, a split liver, and her lungs were punctured with broken bone.

Ms Mulligan, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'The car's engine wasn't running so I didn't hear it and I was knocked out within a few seconds.

'Surprisingly it didn't hurt. It felt like someone patted me on the back.

'I was taken to hospital where there was a lot of blood. It's quite miraculous that I survived.'

The former property management businesswoman was given emergency surgery to repair her lung, before spending months in hospital.

She said: 'Because there was so much wrong with me, lots of different doctors were always coming to see me but I was on so much morphine I didn't really think about what was wrong with me.

'I lost all the muscle in my legs because I wasn't well enough to get out of bed so when I finally tried to walk, I just collapsed to the floor.'

Ms Higham visited her friend in hospital
regularly and burned oil in the hospital room and massaged her legs 
with essential oils.

Ms Mulligan said: 'The oils have fantastic pain killing qualities and they smell wonderful.

Ms Mulligan said the homemade Potion Shop oils, which are blended at her house, have painkilling properties

'I didn't know anything about oils before that but I could see how much they were helping me.

'The doctors couldn't believe how quickly I began to get back on my feet.'

During her recovery, Ms Mulligan looked to keep her mind active and enrolled on an aromatherapy oil course to learn more about the potions that were helping her health and later did a degree in business management.

She said: 'I didn't want to spend 30 hours a week giving someone a massage but I did want to learn more about the oils and their properties.

'The accident allowed me to do something I wanted to do.

'I was pushed into accountancy because I was good at Maths but I never really enjoyed it.

'I just want people 
to see that no matter what they go through and how much it sets them 
back, they can come out the other side and really do something they love
with their lives.

'I still can't run, but I can walk and swim and I enjoy my life so much more.'

The range of alcohol and preservative-free creams so far includes a bracer (skin toner), facial oil and moisturizer, which are all blended at Ms Mulligan's home.

Ms Higham, 50, a lecturer with more than 30 years' experience as a beauty therapist, said: 'It was the most natural thing in the world for Bernie and I to go into business together.

'It's been great working with her because she has such a good business brain.'
