Sentiment is a limited currency in horse racing as Lady Cecil has found out this summer.

The goodwill which carried her Newmarket stable through the second half of last season after the death of her much-loved husband Sir Henry Cecil has largely been replaced by a more pragmatic mood.

Winners are the only commodity which count in a sport where you can go out of fashion faster than last summer’s Royal Ascot frock.

But an ally entwined in the final magnificent chapter of Sir Henry’s career has quite literally kept the Warren Place flag flying.

Lady Cecil ensured tradition was maintained after Frankel’s not-so-little brother Noble Mission won the Group One Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh in May by flying the Cecil family standard above her Warren Place stable.

The colt subsequently secured a second success at the highest level in the Grand Prix de Saint Cloud. But on Saturday at Ascot, Noble Mission could secure a win of infinitely more significance in the Group One Qipco Champion Stakes - the race Frankel won in 2012, 12 months after he had landed the two-furlong shorter Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on the same stage of British Champions day.

The five-year-old, owned by Prince Khaled Abdullah, is 9-2 third favourite behind French-trained 11-8 favourite Cirrus Des Aigles, the French gelding beaten under two lengths by the slow-starting Frankel on an emotionally-charged afternoon when Cecil admits her heart nearly stopped from nervous excitement.

Lady Cecil, who runs Frankel’s half sister Joyueuse in the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on Friday, said: ‘I hardly dare dream. Noble Mission is in great form and has done well for his break. The race can’t come quick enough.

‘We know he likes soft ground – it is just a shame Cirrus does too but it is going to make it hard for some of the others.

‘To even think we are having a runner in with a chance on such a huge day is a huge privilege.

‘He has been a real flag bearer since we have decided to use more forcing tactics.

‘I can’t tell you what it was like that day in Ireland, it was very special, especially him being Frankel’s brother. That was one of things I really wanted to achieve and how likely did it seem last year?’

Eighteen wins this season, but only six since the start of June, have been landed by Lady Cecil from a much-reduced string of around 50 horses.

But she insists she has had no reason to regret the decision to keep her late husband’s stable going.

‘At the beginning, I know it is not a reason to do it, but it was a way of staying close to Henry,’ Lady Cecil said. ‘If it had all had to finish, that would have been more difficult.

‘I haven’t got the numbers of some Newmarket trainers but I think we have done well with what we have got – two Group One wins, two Group Three and a Listed race.

‘I am quite a determined person. I think it has gone well. You always want more and we all want winners but you can’t expect to have them continually. I have a lot to look forward to next year.’

Trainer Sir Michael Stoute has confirmed that a Champions meeting at Ascot on Saturday stripped of many of its biggest names will at least have the Queen’s Estimate lining up in the Long Distance Cup.

It had been feared soft ground might prevent the 2013 Ascot Gold Cup winner running but Stoute said: ‘We’ll give it a shot.’

Encke, the Godolphin-trained 2012 St Leger winner who became embroiled in the Anabolic Steroid scandal involving trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni, sustained a fatal hind limb injury while working on Tuesday.

Australian  jockey Carly-Mae Pye has died from injuries sustained when the horse she was riding broke its front legs during a training run, throwing her head-first into the track.
