Ally McCoist is to stay on as Rangers manager after showdown talks with the club’s board on Wednesday  afternoon.

The 52-year-old met directors Derek Llambias and Sandy Easdale for a meeting at Ibrox that lasted around 40 minutes.

McCoist handed in his notice last Friday, informing the board of his intention to walk away from the club at the end of his 12-month contract.

It’s understood McCoist does not have the support of the Ibrox board, after his side fell nine points behind Hearts in the Championship with the Edinburgh side have played a game less.

But struggling Rangers, who recently admitted needing an injection of £8million to continue as a going concern in 2015, do not have the money to pay the manager off.

So as it stands, McCoist is set to be in the dugout at Ibrox on Saturday for the Scottish Championship match against Livingston.
