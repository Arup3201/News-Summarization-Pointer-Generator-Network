While caviar and velvet manicures may have been hot beauty news in 2012, next year is all about the concrete nail varnish.

After Alexa Chung's leather polish went on to sell out in seconds, Nails Inc have unveiled the concrete manicure and it looks set to be just as popular.

The experts at Nails Inc. explain how their latest polish adds 'urban appeal' to its cult collection of nail polishes.

Nail it: Nails Inc's concrete nail varnish is tipped to be the next big nail art trend

When the polish drys it has a matte, concrete-like consistency and appearance, which the brand maintain is perfect to pair with this season's military trend.

Fashion and beauty blogger Lydia Faye Jones said: 'I'm always looking for a nail polish which is unique in colour and texture.

'Nails Inc concrete polish is sure to pave the way for new innovations in nail polish with its bold and rugged finish.

'The nude shade is my particular favourite- a neutral colour combined with an urban edgy finish.'

Red alert: The red shade is called 'marble arch'

Perfect pastel: The pastel green hue is called 'monument'

Blue hue: The blue bottle is named 'stonehenge'

Famous fans of textured nail varnish looks include Blake Lively, who wore velvet nails on her wedding day with Ryan Reynolds, Rihanna, Katy Perry and, of course, fashion muse Alexa Chung.

The £12 bottle is available from Selfridges in neutral 'London Wall', a deep red 'Marble Arch, a pastel green named 'Monument', as well as 'Stonehenge'- a vibrant blue hue.
