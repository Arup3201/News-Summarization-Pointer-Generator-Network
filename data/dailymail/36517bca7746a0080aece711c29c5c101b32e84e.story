An American artist has 
exposed her most private moments in a series of self-portraits that 
portray her eating behind closed doors.

The thought-provoking images, painted with almost photographic realism, depict the artist in different secret bingeing scenarios.

In
 one she's surrounded by cupcakes on the sofa, another shows her lying 
on a bed covered in fast food wrappers and in others she's eating in the
 bath and even in the loo.

Lee Price from Santa Fe in New Mexico, USA, who painted these compelling 
pieces 'grappled with eating disorders' growing up and wanted to explore
 the complex relationship some women have with food through her art.

'When I’m having difficulties in my life food is still how I deal with things,' admits the artist, now 47. 'It's not the severity that it was, but I might grab a pint of Haagen Dazs without thinking.'

'The paintings are very personal,' Lee tells MailOnline. 'They explore compulsive behavior. I use food as the focus, but
 any number of other things could stand in for food.'

'They're about the multifarious ways we check out. We use food to
 seek solace, but then our search for comfort turns into a way of not 
being present in the moment,' she explains.

The artist believes that women's relationship with food is central to the relationship we have to the world.

'By portraying women involved in as
 intimate an act as eating, I am exploring a broader context of 
women’s situation,' she explains.

The lifelike paintings are a narrative on women's relationship with food

'My paintings, I hope, point 
the viewer toward asking what we are truly hungry for, and what might be
 a healthier way of expressing that hunger, and seeking out its 
satiation,' she says.

Although the images are about secrecy and compulsion, the artist doesn't associate her paintings with shame. 'In fact, there’s a kind of defiance in the gaze in many of the paintings,' she says.

'I
 get various interpretations,' says the artist. 'Many people miss the connection to 
emotional eating my paintings represent.

'Then I get tonnes of emails from 
people – men and women both – who respond on a very personal level to 
the content of my work. Both responses resonate for me.'

'What’s important to me is not so much how people take them in, but
 simply that they take them in, each in their own way,' she says.

What also stands out in the images are the unusual settings -- the bathroom, toilet and bedroom aren't your typical eating spots.

'I wanted to use a private place, a peaceful place of solitude, 
and set against it this frenetic activity of compulsive behavior in 
which the subjects are engaged,' explains Lee.

'The irony then becomes that in the midst
 of the chaos of their behavior there is peace. The women just can’t see
 that,' adds the artist.

The mesmerising images are currently being exhibited at Evoke Contemporary Gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
