Republicans grabbed three Democratic-held Senate seats early on Tuesday evening,scoring victories in West Virginia, South Dakota and Arkansas.

The most notable was freshman Rep. Tom Cotton, who knocked off two-term Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas.

This despite the fact the Sen. Pryor received several visits from the state's most famous politician, former president Bill Clinton, who swung down to repeatedly stump for the incumbent.

In the end, he lost in a landslide, receiving a little over 40% of the vote, as opposed to the nearly 57% received by Rep. Cotton.  

Republicans also easily replaced retiring Democratic senators in West Virginia and South Dakota.

The support of Hillary Clinton proved to be even more toxic to some campaigns it would seem, with six of the candidates endorsed by the woman many believe could be this country's next president losing.

They include Alison Lundergan Grimes from Kentucky, Kaya Hagan from North Carolina, Mark Udall in Colorado, Bruce Braley in Iowa and Michelle Nunn in Georgia, who were all running for U.S. Senate.

Alison Lundergan Grimes lost in Kentucky

She also stumped for Anthony Brown, who lost his bid to be governor of Maryland. 

As expected, GOP Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia won the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller. 

And former Gov. Mike Rounds of South Dakota won retiring Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson's seat. 

McConnell, of Kentucky, won a sixth term of his own, and immediately warned Obama of coming confrontations.

'For too long, this administration has tried to tell the American people what's good for them and then blame somebody else when their policies didn't work out,' McConnell told cheering fans. 

McConnell and Cotton, an Iraq combat veteran and Harvard Law School graduate, joined virtually every other Republican nationwide in relentlessly linking their opponent to the president whose popularity has sagged.

Pryor, the last Democrat in Arkansas' congressional delegation, is the son of a popular former governor and senator. But Arkansas and West Virginia have been trending sharply Republican. Obama lost Arkansas by 24 percentage points in 2012.

In Kentucky, Democrats once had high hopes for challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes, the state's young secretary of state. But the hill was too steep in a state Obama lost by 23 percentage points in 2012.

McConnell's allies taunted Grimes for refusing to say whether she had voted for Obama.

Republicans also celebrated Sen. Tim Scott becoming the first black elected to the Senate from a former Confederate state since Reconstruction. He was appointed to the Senate last year, and won a term of his own Tuesday. 

Democrats privately said they hoped to limit their net Senate losses to five seats, which would barely keep them in control, but they failed to do so.
