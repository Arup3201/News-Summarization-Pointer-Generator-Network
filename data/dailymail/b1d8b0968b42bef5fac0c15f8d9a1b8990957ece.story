A Golden Globes night Twitter trend urged red carpet interviewers to ditch the 'What are you wearing' questions and, instead, ask women 'what are you reading?'

The trending message #AskHerMore gained increasing traction as awards night wore on and originated from co-host Amy Poehler's Smart Girls campaign.

'What if we asked actresses on the red carpet more than “who are you wearing?”' the organization tweeted as the Golden Globes first kicked off.

'#AskHerMore': Golden Globes host Amy Poehler's Smart Girls campaign urged Sunday nights red carpet interviewers to ask women on the red carpet more than just 'Who are you wearing?'

Tweeting directly at E! red carpet interviewers Giuliana Rancic and Ryan Seacrest, @smrtgrls offered a list of the kind of questions they'd like to see, including:

Who inspires you?, What is your favorite book?, What else would you like to achieve in your career?, and What did you character teach you? 

While the hashtag quickly got women and girls of Twitter talking about more thoughtful interview questions, those posed on the actual red carpet were decidedly typical. 

The #AskHerMore fans had a solution.

'Maybe next year since they're not hosting Amy & Tina could work the red carpet & ask all these #AskHerMore questions. I'd watch,' tweeted @reallychristy.

Twitter users also gave some suggestions of what women might be asked next year or at the next red carpet event.

'Who is your role model? What advice would you give to young girls? What makes you happoest? Who are you celebrating tonight? #AskHerMore' tweeted @brandyismagic.

'If you could invent a solution to any problem, what would it be?' wonders @ErinNull1. 

@soniavalliant suggested:

'Everyone is faced with adversity at some point - what advice would you give to young women facing negativity?'
