Two heavily pregnant Iranian refugees who refused to get off a bus at the Blaydin immigration detention centre in the Northern Territory for three days have been taken into detention.

Maryam, her husband Adnan and their 10 year-old son Amir, along with Tahere and her husband Hossein had been on the bus since 10pm on Saturday, when they arrived in Darwin on a flight from Nauru.

The women are both eight months pregnant, with Maryam experiencing complications, and were brought to Darwin with the belief they would be housed in the community for the weeks leading up to the births.

It is understood that 10-year-old Amir left the bus on Monday afternoon and was accommodated in the facility at Wickham Point, about 40km south of Darwin.

Two International Health and Medical Services midwives were monitoring the women, Immigration and Border Protection Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement.

'The women and their families were temporarily transferred to Australia for medical purposes. The families hold valid Nauruan visas and have been settled in that country.'

They do not hold Australian visas, he said.

'The women have been placed in the facility best suited to their medical needs. Other family members have been accommodated voluntarily, according to their preference,' he said.

They had been on Nauru for about 15 months and had been released as refugees and were living in the community for about six months, said Adnan's brother Soliman Shirvani.

He said the women were relieved to finally be off the bus.

Mr Shirvani said when the women arrived in Darwin, they were told they didn't have the correct documentation and had to be taken into detention at Wickham Point, which they refused.

Mr Shirvani spent four years in detention in Darwin before being accepted as a refugee and moving to Melbourne, and says he was concerned about how the women were coping in the bus in the intense heat.

However, the ABC reported that there was air conditioning on the bus while Ian Rintoul, spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition said, according to sources within the centre, they received food, water and medical attention.

'They offered to pay rent for any accommodation outside of detention,' Mr Shirvani told AAP on Monday.

'It's too hard when you live outside and someone wants to take you to detention again, with a pregnant wife.'

He did not know when his brother would be able to call him again. 

Mr Rintoul said the fact it took two and a half days to resolve the matter 'says everything about the contempt the minister has for pregnant women who have come here as refugees.'

'A bus was not an appropriate place for them to be kept,' he said. 'They should not be in immigration detention, they deserve respect as people found to be refugees.

'They should not be deprived of their liberty.' 

He said it was yet to be revealed what the terms of the agreement were.

A spokesman from the Department of Immigration said the couples had not been told they would be housed in the community, but at Wickham Point.

He said the women received the care appropriate to their condition.
