A landscape gardener is trumpeting the great British creation of the bandstand after touring the country's parks to study the iconic structures for a new book. 

Paul Rabbitts, 49, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, was inspired to research Britain's bandstands in 2011 after acting as a consultant for the restoration of the one in Albert Park, Middlesbrough. 

He looked into the history of the bandstand and discovered what happened to the 1,200 that were built between the 1860s through to the Second World War.

Then: The bandstand in Albert Park, Middlesbrough, still exists today. It was built in 1871 and was re-erected in 2005

Now: The bandstand in Albert Park, Middlesbrough. The park itself was  first opened in 1868 and remains open to this day

Mr Rabbitts has now charted the demise and resurgence of hundreds of the outdoor theatres that have graced pleasure gardens and seafront proms in cities and towns from Dundee to Dover for 150 years.

Many of the country's bandstands were broken up during the Second World War as the ironwork used for railings was melted down to make ammunition and weapons.

Mr Rabbitts' book, Bandstands of Britain, documents dozens of these structures that have been restored to their former glory over the last 20 years using money from the National Lottery.

Then: The bandstand in Ventor Park, Ventor, which was built in 1887. Around 1,200 were built from the 1860s through to the Second World War

Now: The bandstand in Ventor Park, Ventor, where it still stands today. It was lucky - many were broken up during the Second World War as the iron used for railings was melted down to make ammunition and weapons

It also pays homage to some of the 900 structures that have been lost to the nation over the years and those that have simply been left to ruin.

His book is also a celebration of the elaborate architecture and ironwork that went into building beautiful bandstands in the 19th century, a creation that was copied in many countries across the world.

Mr Rabbitts, a local council parks' manager, said: 'Bandstands are a great British invention and have been a feature of our way of life for well over a century.

'They were not just a focal point for a park but they provided a stage to perform live music, too.

'During their heyday in the Victorian era, bandstands were enormously popular and drew crowds of up to 10,000.

Then: The Bandstand at Temple Gardens and Arboretum, Lincoln, was built in 1884

'Sadly many fell into disuse and were neglected and many were demolished as public parks and seaside resorts went into a spiral of decline in the 1980s and 1990s.

'In 1997 the Heritage Lottery Fund started investing in our public parks and gardens and this has seen the rediscovery of bandstands which has continued to this day.

'And they aren't being used just for live music, but also for theatre, drama and opera.'

Although a pavilion in Vauxhall Gardens in London was built in the 1700s to house bands to play classical music to large crowds, bandstands only started popping up after the industrial revolution in the 19th century.

Paul said: 'Towns grew rapidly and open spaces were built on. In the 1820s politicians noticed the working class spent much of their spare time in pubs.

'They set about creating municipal parks for the industrial terrace-dwellers to relax in and listen to music and from there the bandstand evolved.'

The first towns to build a bandstand included Leeds, which once had 18 compared to just one today, Sheffield, Bradford, Rochdale and London.

Seaside resorts like Brighton, Eastbourne and Paignton followed the trend, with each trying to outdo the other with their ornate designs.

Paul said: 'A lot of bandstands disappeared during the Second World War as the iron was needed to be melted down.

'After the war the advent of the record player, television and cinema resulted in bandstands to fall into mass decline.

'Out of nearly 1,200 bandstands about 350 original ones are standing today.. Another 150 or so have been built in modern times.'
