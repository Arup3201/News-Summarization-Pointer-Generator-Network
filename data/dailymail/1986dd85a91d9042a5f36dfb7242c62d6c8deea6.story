It was a farce that would lead to a goalkeeper given a red card, a team red with anger... and the Dutch FA red-faced after reversing the ref's decision.

The trouble began when a drunk hooligan ran on to the field to 
attack AZ Alkmaar's No.1 during the first half of their Cup match with 
former European champions Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena last night.

To everyone's surprise, Costa Rican goalie Esteban Alvarado 
then launched a kung fu kick at the teenage 
thug, sending him crashing to the floor - and landed a few more kicks before security guards dragged the invader away.

And when referee Bas Nijhuis red-carded the goalkeeper, Alkmaar coach Gertjan
 Verbeek ordered his side to walk off in protest.

Now, however, the red card has been rescinded by the Dutch FA (KNVB).

Kung fu fighting: AZ Alkmaar's goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado spots an Ajax fan charging at him just in time

Attacked turned attacker: Alvarado turns the tables on the hooligan by kicking him on the ground

A
 statement read: 'The keeper was attacked unexpectedly and therefore the
 prosecutor judged that his mood caused his response against his 
attacker.' 

At the time, Nijhuis said: 'I understand that Esteban was defending himself, but he walked to him (the supporter) and kicked him multiple times. He could also have walked away.'

Ajax were leading the round-of-16 match 1-0 after a goal by Gregory van der Wiel when the incident happened 36 minutes in. Attempts to convince Alkmaar to continue were fruitless.

Alkmaar club director Toon Gerbrands said his players 'didn't feel safe any more in this situation'.

Ajax apologised for the security lapse and said the supporter, who was aged 19, would receive a lifetime ban from games.

Dutch Football Association director Bert van Oostveen said his organisation was considering the incident, but is not certain whether or not the game will be replayed.

Ajax coach Frank de Boer, a renowned former defender for the Netherlands' national team, said of Alvarado's reaction: 'Maybe I would have done the same thing, maybe not. But emotionally I do understand it.'

It is not the first time a player has attacked a fan. In 1995, Manchester United's then star Eric Cantona famously lashed out at an abusive supporter who was sitting in the front row during the team's clash with Crystal Palace.

Cantona was fined £20,000, banned for nine months and stripped of his French captaincy after the incident.

He claimed the fan shouted racial insults and threw a missile at him as he walked off the pitch after being given a red card for kicking another player during a tackle.
