A man whose  scrotum has grown to the size of a watermelon may have it removed after a Melbourne plastic surgeon offered to perform the surgery for free.

Tyrone Bowd from Willowbank, south west of Brisbane, was faced with having to raise $100,000 to have the life-saving surgery in America after being diagnosed with scrotal lymphedema a year ago.

But surgeon Dr Ramin Shayan reached out to the 24-year-old's mother Tanya on Monday with the offer of free surgery after the family raised $10,000 in one week from public donations.

Tryone Bowd, whose watermelon-sized scrotum caused him to have a motorbike accident at his Queensland home last year, will now have surgery to remove it

Mr Bowd's rare condition causes infections that result in soaring temperatures, increased heart rate and makes his body turn septic. His large scrotum also makes it a struggle to walk.

Dr Ramin Shayan, who has a PhD in lymphoedema, said he would complete the surgery at St Vincent's and the O'Brien Institute in Melbourne

Dr Shayan, who has a PhD in lymphoedema, said he would complete the surgery at St Vincent's and the O'Brien Institute in Melbourne, pending a review of Mr Bowd's medical records.

'We were told no one in Australia could help us, so to find out there’s help is great,' Mrs Bowd told South-West News.

Dr Shayan, who has operated on two patients with similar conditions, said Mr Bowd’s would continue to grow and eventually stop him from walking and wearing normal clothes.

'The life threatening part of this would be the infections he could get,' Dr Shayan said.

'Why should this poor guy try and struggle with his life, $100,000 is the cost of a house in some parts of the country.'

Mrs Bowd said her son, who weighs 112kg and also has an inverted penis, had previously sought help from more than 100 medical professionals.

She said the last 12 months had been emotional for her and her son, who is intellectually impaired.

'Some days I get to the point where I think we won’t get the help we need but as a mother I can’t stop. I’m 100 per cent committed to saving my son’s life,' Mrs Bowd said.

Mrs Bowd told the South-West News last week that her son no longer had faith in doctors and was 'banging his head against a wall' in frustration that no one medical professional in Australia could help his heartbreaking situation.

'One response I got was they could give him a sex change but couldn’t repair his scrotum so I basically threw my hands in the air,' she said.

'A couple of doctors said they could build a team and give it a go and I said "it's not a game of cricket mate, he's not a guinea pig".'

His family held a car drive in Ipswich on Saturday to raise funds for Tyrone to fly to California to undergo lifesaving surgery performed by Dr Joel Geldman - they raised $10,000.

Mrs Bowd had been liaising with Dr Geldman who guaranteed he and his medical team could perform the operation.

Wesley Warren famously had his scrotal lymphedema corrected by Dr Geldman after going public on shock jock Howard Stern's radio show to talk about the plight of his 45kg scrotum.

Mr Warren died in March after suffering two heart attacks when he was hospitalised due to complications from diabetes.

Dr Geldman told Mrs Bowd that he had performed the procedure 175 times.

'I've contacted Dr Geldman and I have had continuous correspondence with him,' she said.

'He has been monitoring Tyrone's condition via medical reports CT scans, ultrasounds and photographs.'

Mrs Bowd said that maintaining a normal family life was difficult.

'Tyrone needs help to go to the toilet and he has a lot of difficulty walking,' she said.

'He broke his leg in a motorbike accident earlier this year and that’s because his scrotum was a hindrance on the bike.'

'His scrotum is so big that he can’t ride a bike anymore and family and friends pitched in to get him a quad bike.'

Ms Bowd said Tyrone had a heart of gold and rarely complained about the pain.

'He is always trying to make everyone he meets laugh, he loves fast cars, motor bikes, playing jokes, listening to music and spending time with people,' she said.
