The billionaire husband of Elle Macpherson is being sued for $50million in relation to a fatal helicopter crash last year which claimed the life of his best friend.

The lawsuit is being brought against hotel heir Jeff Soffer, 44, by the family of Lance Valdez, who died in the Bahamas crash last Thanksgiving.

The 48-year-old father-of-three was traveling to the up-scale Baker's Bay Golf and Ocean Club on Great Guana Cay on November 22 when a gust of wind hit their chopper as it was landing and sent it plunging to the ground.

The rotor blades hit the ground and threw three of the passengers out - Lance and Soffer's employees Dan and Paula Riordan.

The couple survived the accident along with the pilot. They all suffered serious injuries.

Sources told the New York Post's Page Six the suit will contain 'bombshell claims' including allegations the billionaire was at the controls when the chopper crashed.

It is not known if he has a helicopter license.

'Lance’s family and friends believe some details of the crash have been covered up. They want answers,' the source said.

An investigation was launched by the Bahamian authorities, but no conclusive report appears to have been filed.

Steven C. Marks, an attorney who specializes in aviation disasters and represented Soffer and the other victims after the crash, told the New York Post: 'Mr Soffer was a passenger, just like Mr Valdez. The pilot signed a statement saying he was in command at the time of the crash. Mr. Soffer is a victim, and was not responsible for the crash.

'A large settlement was paid to Mr Valdez’s family after all the statements were taken, so I don’t understand why they would take this position and challenge the facts now.'

Soffer is a hotel heir and head of the Miami-based Turnberry Associates, one of the country's leading property firms, owners of the famed but financially troubled Fontainebleau resort in Miami Beach as well as condominiums in Las Vegas, the Bahamas and Washington D.C.

Soffer rekindled his relationship with Elle Macpherson soon after and the couple got married earlier this year. He was recently linked to Gwyneth Platrow after she was accused of cheating on her husband of ten years Chris Martin with him.
