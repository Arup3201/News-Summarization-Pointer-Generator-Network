Outspoken journalist Samantha Brick has angered parents around Britain expressing her disgust with the 'uncivilised pushchair posse', and calling for a ban on baby buggies in public places, particularly during rush hour.

Brick, 42, appeared on ITV's Daybreak to debate about whether or not prams should be banned from public places, in light of research that shows more cafes, buses and shopping centres are prohibiting buggies from using their facilities.

The childless blonde - who first courted controversy by stating that all women hate her because she's beautiful - took on broadcaster and mother-of-two Emma B, declaring that she 'wholeheartedly agrees' with cafe owners who forbid parents with prams from entering their restaurants.

Emma B jumped in to defend pram-pushing 
parents, explaining that, sizewise, today's buggies are remarkably 
modest compared to the enormous Silver Cross perambulators favoured by 
wealthy parents in the early 1900s

The opinionated blonde said: 'I used to live in Kew Gardens and the local cafe was dominated by 'the pushchair posse'. There was an ageing population and a business population and none of us could get through.

'Of course mothers with prams have as much right to be there, but when you get a woman behind a pushchair it does become a weapon of mass destruction. It's like the modern day version of a gladiator with a chariot: she is armed and dangerous.

'The number of times I've had my shins run into or I've been knocked off the pavement... You can say it's a joke and they're only children, but we're a society and we've all got to share the pavement.'

Emma B jumped in to defend pram-pushing parents, explaining that, sizewise, today's buggies are remarkably modest compared to the enormous Silver Cross perambulators favoured by wealthy parents in the early 1900s and before.

When Brick complained that buggies are everywhere - from cafes and buses to shopping centres and supermarkets - and should at least be banned during rush hour, Emma B interjected that mothers and fathers pushing prams have absolutely no desire to be on the streets during rush hour.

She said: 'The vast majority of parents are trying to get from A to B with the least hassle possible.'

Samantha said: 'The number of times I've had my shins run into or I've been knocked off the pavement... You can say it's a joke and they're only children, but we're a society and we've all got to share the pavement'

Brick also commented that it was 'fair enough' for Emma B to have once been asked to get off a bus when pushing her little girl in a buggy.

She added: 'I was shopping with my elderly gran in a wheelchair recently and there was no question of us gettting into the lift before those women with buggies - and some of them are like mini cars: they've got drinks containers, playcentres... it's gone too far.'

Twitter users reacted unfavourably to Brick's comments. Sheryl2311 said: 'Samantha Brick on @Daybreak complaining about women with baby buggies in coffee shops.Stupid woman.'

Askey9 said: 'Is Samantha Brick for real @Daybreak!? Ridiculous!'

Speaking about the 'pushchair posse', Brick said: 'They assume they are Queen of the Pavement and refuse to budge an inch for the rest of society - including the elderly and infirm'

Twitter users were not impressed with Samantha Brick's comments, and took to the micro-blogging site to call her 'stupid'

Speaking to MailOnline, Brick added: 'All too many mothers get behind nearly 50 kilos of stainless steel and become utterly uncivilised.

'They assume they are Queen of the Pavement and refuse to budge an inch for the rest of society - including the elderly and infirm.

'Until the pushchair posse recognise they don't have a divine right to use their (usually in need of a clean) weapons of mass destruction on four wheels where and when they please - then calls for them to be banned will continue.

'I for one don't want to see them on buses or the tube during rush hour. I've had enough knocked shins, scuffed heels and laddered tights to last me a lifetime.

'After all the planet and the human race managed perfectly well without them for centuries.'
