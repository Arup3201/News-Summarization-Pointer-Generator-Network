Kumar Sangakkara reached 12,000 Test runs but bowlers were otherwise dominant on day one of the second Test between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Wellington.

A total of 15 wickets fell on a green track at the Basin Reserve - four of them to Nuwan Pradeep - as the hosts were bowled out for 221 before Sri Lanka slipped to 78 for five, Doug Bracewell taking three for 23.

Sangakkara, though, stood firm on 33 not out having become the fastest player, and the first from his country, to break the 12,000 barrier. He is only the fifth man to achieve the feat.

But it was a day for the bowlers at Wellington as 15 wickets fell on the first day of the second Test

New Zealand made a steady start after being put in, openers Tom Latham and Hamish Rutherford putting on 31 in seven overs before the former was caught behind off Suranga Lakmal.

Kane Williamson was the lynchpin of the innings with 69, adding 31 with Rutherford who then gave wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene his second catch.

Williamson and Ross Taylor put on 79 before Taylor (35) chopped on to become Pradeep's second victim.

Brendon McCullum, who before the match had been presented with the freedom of the city of Wellington, failed to celebrate as he slashed his second ball from Lakmal on to the stumps.

Williamson's half-century arrived with an unconvincing edge short of first slip which bounced away to the boundary. It was his eighth four in 75 balls.

But he lost further partners in Jimmy Neesham and BJ Watling before becoming the seventh man out as he went in similar fashion to McCullum and Taylor, bowled off the inside edge.

Tim Southee became Pradeep's fourth victim and Bracewell was last man out after an enterprising last-wicket stand of 26 with Trent Boult.

Sri Lanka opener Dimuth Karunaratne edged Boult to slip and Kusal Silva joined the ranks of batsmen playing on, though in unfortunate fashion as a defensive push at Bracewell came off the toe end, bounced up and looped onto the top of his stumps.

But Sangakkara tucked Boult through the leg side for two to reach his landmark, joining only Indian pair Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, former Australia captain Ricky Ponting and South Africa all-rounder Jacques Kallis.

The scoreless Lahiru Thirimanne almost immediately fended Bracewell to McCullum at short cover and Angelo Mathews made 15 before edging Southee to keeper Watling.

Jayawardene joined Sangakkara to see Sri Lanka through to the close, making six before falling in the final over to end the day's play.
