The father behind hit Tumblr photo blog Reasons My Son Is Crying is accepting photographic contributions from parents worldwide in attempt to explore the 'universal culture of toddler' - and the best ones will be entered into a contest to win a camera.

Greg Pembroke, from Rochester, New York, began taking mid-tantrum photos of his infant sons Charlie, 22 months, and William, three-and-a-half, and captioning the images with the (mostly unreasonable) reasons for the boys' tears.

The hilarious tags range from 'I broke his cheese in half' and 'I wiped the dirt off his pear', to 'we asked him to stop hitting his brother with a plastic wand' and 'his milk was in the wrong cup'.

Pembroke - who writes commercials for
 radio stations and is married to Charity, a physical therapist -  
initially began his light-hearted hobby by posting images and captions 
on his personal Facebook page.

But when friends began telling him they wanted to share his jokes with their own friends, they encouraged him to launch a blog.

Within five days his Tumblr page had 
gone viral, and was being featured in news outlets, websites and 
magazines all over the world. The family were invited to talk on Good 
Morning America.

Speaking to MailOnline, Pembroke 
said: 'It's so interesting. I started it for a bit of fun, and it got 
big completely by accident. The first photo we did was the cheese one. I
 broke it in half after he asked me to, and when he got upset I thought 
his reaction was so hilariously unreasonable. It went from there.

'The
 best bit is that I've been getting emails from all over the world from 
people saying they find it so relatable. It doesn't matter where in the 
world you are, the universal culture of toddler is the same.'

He continued: 'Some
 of the funniest contributions I've had are one from Australia with a 
picture
 of a little boy crying his face off because his mother unwrapped a 
chocolate biscuit. Then there's a little girl in China whose mum didn't 
pick her up quickly enouigh, and a girl in South Korea who is literally 
crying over 
spilled milk.'

Pembroke is now publishing global 
contributions to his site, and has launched a contest to find the 
funniest reason for a child crying, with the best one winning a digital 
camera, donated to him by Sony.

He said: 'I have gotten so many great pictures that I wanted to find a way to recognize some of them.'

Greg and his wife will pick the 10 best submissions and put them to a vote on Tumblr. Submissions can be entered until 15 May.

While Pembroke's Tumblr site has 
attracted mostly praise, there have been instances of online critics 
branding it unethical, and wondering how the father-of-two thinks his 
sons will feel about his project once they grow up. But Pembroke 
dismisses suggestions that his blog is in some way damaging to his 
children.

'Of
 course there will be people with negative things to say,' he said. 'But
 I don't listen to them. I'm sharing roughly a quarter of a second of my
 day with the world, and I know how happy my kids are the rest of the time.

'I
 know how I'm raising my boys, and I don't think they cry any more than 
anyone else's children - that's why I opened the blog up to other 
parents. It started out just for fun, but now it's bringing everyone together and reminding us that while we're all so different in so many ways, some things are universal.'

I wouldn't let him eat mud

Speaking about how his blog might make the boys feel as adults, Pembroke is convinced they'll love it.

He
 said: 'They have no idea what's going on now, but I'm going to put 
together a scrapbook for them of newspaper cuttings and screengrabs from
 all over the world.

'When I
 was in college I had a roommate who discovered that when he was three 
years old he'd appeared on a Fisherprice toy box. He loved finding that 
out.

'I've had interest in the blog everywhere, lots of calls from lots of people. It's been quite crazy. It's been translated into Chinese and I've had interest from publishers about turning it into a 
book.

'It's 
been very fun and I'm excited to see where it goes. It's so fun to have 
found something that everyone in the world can relate to, whether or not they have kids.'

He asked me to put butter on his rice. I put butter on his rice.

We helped him put on the boots he loves to wear, left, and the milk was in the wrong cup, right
