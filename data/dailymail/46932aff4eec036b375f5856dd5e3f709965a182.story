A young woman told she was 'anorexic' when her weight plummeted to seven stone has recovered after having Botox injections. 

Jade Nock lost weight after struggling to keep any solid food down.

The 25-year-old had to endure a year being fed through a tube, before eventually being diagnosed with a rare condition called gastric dysrhythmia.

The illness caused Miss Nock's stomach to automatically expel any food she swallowed.

Jade Nock, 25, from Walsham-le-Willows in Suffolk was told by doctors she was anorexic after suddenly losing weight when she was unable to keep food down

Miss Nock was in fact suffering gastric dysrhythmia - a condition which caused her stomach to expel food automatically. For a year she was fed through a feeding tube, left, before she was diagnosed and treated using Botox injections to 'freeze' her stomach tissue

Since her diagnosis, doctors have been able to cure her of the condition by administering twice-yearly Botox injections.

The anti-wrinkle treatment works to 'freeze' the tissue in Miss Nock's stomach, allowing her to digest solid food again. 

Miss Nock, whose weight is now stable, said: 'I began feeling sick suddenly one night while I was out in London with friends. I went home thinking it was a stomach bug.

'My mum Ali gave me dry toast and tea, and I couldn't keep that down either. Even keeping water down was impossible.'

The former maternity ward auxiliary was taken to hospital by her mother, after several days of sickness.

Staff at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital put the 25-year-old on a drop to replenish her fluids.

She was sent home to Walsham-le-Willows in Suffolk with the assurance that she was suffering from a passing stomach bug.

But her sickness continued, resulting in her losing weight rapidly. 

In around three weeks she lost three stone, prompting a return to hospital in November 2008.

She said: 'A doctor sat at the end of my bed and told me I must have been suffering from anorexia - that my inability to keep food down had psychological rather than physical roots.

'I was stunned, and burst into tears. I knew that it wasn't all just in my head - that there was something else going on. 

'For one thing, I loved my job and was desperate to get well again so I could go back to work.'

Her mother Ali, pictured right, took Miss Nock to the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital after she suffered several days of sickness. She was sent home with the assurance she was suffering a bug but the vomiting continued

Miss Nock was allowed  home under observation but returned to hospital around a month later for the traumatic experience of being fitted with a feeding tube.

She said: 'It wasn't very nice. I ended up pulling one of my tubes out because I was feeling incredibly depressed by the situation.

Gastric dysrhythmia is a condition that causes the stomach to automatically empty.

As soon as any food enters the stomach, the condition causes a sufferer to vomit, expelling it immediately.

It is connected to a similar condition gastroparesis - a neuromuscular disorder of the stomach.

Gastric dysrythmias are caused when electrical signals governing the function of the stomach are disturbed, leading to nausea and vomiting. 

It is a broad term covering a range of illnesses.

' I was told I was allowed to eat solid food at the same time, but whenever I did the tube became dislodged when I was inevitably sick afterwards.

'I was even put on a course of anti-psychotic medication which really spaced me out. 

'I began to think that the problems really were just all in my mind - after all that was anyone's best guess at the time.'

The following summer, doctors concerned at Miss Nock's mounting depression booked her in for an appointment at the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, where she was given a meal of scrambled eggs laced with radioactive tracer to monitor the passage of food through her body.

It was then that doctors saw that her stomach was expelling food completely from her stomach.

An appointment with a specialist at the Royal Free Hospital in London in January 2010 confirmed that she had gastric arrhythmia - a condition which interrupts the stomach's ability to hold and process food and liquid.

She said: 'It was nice that people were listening to me after so long. I thought, "at least something's going to get done now".

'There were two options - have Botox to firm up the tissue in my stomach, or a pacemaker-like device in my stomach. The plan was to try the Botox first and see what happened.'

After being referred to see a specialist at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge, Miss Nock was finally diagnosed with the stomach condition. She now requires Botox injections every six months to keep the illness at bay

In May 2010, surgeons gave Miss Nock, who is engaged to automotive engineer Vincent Norton, 22, her first injection through a needle mounted on a camera which was guided down her throat.

She said: 'It took a few days to start working, but then when it did work, it was amazing.

'I had my first solid food - mashed potato with cheese - a week after the first injection. Having been suffering for more than a year, it was revelation to be able to digest solid food again. Shortly after that I said goodbye to the feeding tube forever.'

Miss Nock's weight is now stable at seven stone but she requires Botox injections every six months to make sure that the gastric dysrhythmia does not return.

She said: 'As the injections wear off I start to bring up food again which means my weight will drop off.

'I can't eat food which is too rich or creamy. I can't overeat - if I push myself, it doesn't stay down.

'I'd heard of Botox being used medically to cure bladder conditions before - but not the stomach. 

'When I tell people, some people are surprised, and think that such treatment is just for cosmetic purposes.

'I was wary. I thought 'how's it going to work?' I was happy to go along with it if there was a chance it was going to be effective - and I'm so glad it was.

'I love stew and dumplings and sausage casserole - home cooking that my nan used to make. I also like chicken pie.

'I appreciate food much more now that I've been through this experience. I used to be quite fussy, but now I'm more open. I know how lucky I am to be able to have food - I don't want to turn anything down.'
