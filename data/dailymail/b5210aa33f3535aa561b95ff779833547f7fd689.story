A tourist happily swims in the mush of thousands of pulped tomatoes. He's seeing red and loving every minute of  it.

For this is the annual battle in a Spanish Mediterranean town which has staged the food fight fiesta for more than 60 years.

Tens of thousands of revellers - some from as far as Japan and Australia -  took to the streets of Bunol, near Valencia, to join in the fun.

They pelted each other with 120 tonnes of ripe tomatoes on hand in five loaded trucks.

This year, Brunol's town hall estimated about 40,000 people joined the hour-long fight known as Tomatina, which has its origins in a food fight between two boys in 1945.

Many wore goggles and old clothes as they were drenched in the sea of red pips and pulp. And when they finished the town set up portable showers and opened up fire hydrants so they could shower off the stains.

And once the battle was over, the streets and walls were hosed down, ready for next year's vegetable  party.

In 1945, young men who wanted to participate in a local parade staged a brawl picking up tomatoes from a nearby vegetable stand and using them as weapons.

The police intervened to break it up, but the following year they repeated the fight, only this time they brought their own tomatoes.

Over the years, the party was, albeit unofficially, established but was banned many times before it was officially sanctioned in 1959.

The town of Bunol imposed a rule that people could only throw tomatoes after a horn sounded and should end when it sounded a second time. Revellers had to smash the tomato in their hands first and then throw it on each other.

The festivities begin at around 10 am, with the first event of the Tomatina. The goal is to climb a greased pole with a ham on top.

As this happens, the crowd work into a frenzy of singing and dancing while being showered with water from hoses. Once someone is able to drop the ham off the pole, the start signal for the tomato fight is given with a loud shot.

Several trucks throw tomatoes in abundance in the Plaza del Pueblo. The tomatoes come from Extremadura, where they are less expensive and are grown specifically for the holidays, being of inferior taste.

After exactly an hour, the fight ends with the firing of the second shot, announcing the end. The whole town square is colored red and rivers of tomato juice flow freely.

Fire Trucks hose down the streets and participants use hoses that locals provide to remove the tomato paste from their bodies. After the cleaning, the village cobblestone streets are pristine due to the acidity of the tomato disinfecting and thoroughly cleaning the surfaces.
