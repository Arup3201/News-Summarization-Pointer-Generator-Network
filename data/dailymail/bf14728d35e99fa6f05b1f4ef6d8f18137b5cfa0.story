A New York Yankees charity will pay for the education of the sons of murdered NYPD cop Rafael Ramos, after their father was gunned down in his patrol car in Brooklyn on Saturday.

The Yankee Silver Shield Foundation, which provides  for the children of officers who died in the line of duty, will take on any education expenses for 13-year-old Jaden and Ramos' other son who is in college.

Rafael Ramos, 40, was murdered in the targeted attack alongside his  partner Wenjian Liu when 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Abdullah Brinsley crept up behind their patrol car and shot them both in the head - before turning the gun on himself.

Liu, 32, was recently married but did not have any children.

Former Yankees owner George Steinbrenner set up the Silver Shield Foundation in 1982 and since then it has paid for the education of thousands of children of fallen NYPD, FDNY, state police and Port Authority workers in the tri-state area.

It has also taken on the costs for the education of some 700 children who lost a parent in the terrorists attacks on September 11, 2001.

The Silver Shield Foundation was started by James Fuchs and George Steinbrenner in 1982 to pay for the education expenses of all children and spouses of New York law enforcement and other authorities killed in the line of duty.

In a phone interview with ABC News, the group's chairman William Walters said the foundation has already reached out to the police department, but it has not been in contact with Ramos' family.

'We just want to do good for these people that take care of us,' he added.

After hearing the news of his father's death, Jaden Ramos took to social media to publicly celebrate his adoring father and condemn his cold-blooded killer.

Jaden posted this picture online several days ago as a birthday present to his father Rafael Ramos

'Today I had to say bye to my father. He was their for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer,' he posted.

'Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.' 

Jaden's  tribute came Sunday as a heartbroken community in Brooklyn started a makeshift memorial of flowers and candles at the site of the slayings in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.

Ramos' cousin, Ronnie Gonzalez, insisted that the family's focus is on remembering the father, rather than directing anger at gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley.

'[Brinsley] in the hands of God now,' Gonzalez told Pix11. 'We don't believe in vengeance, we just forgive.'

He added that Ramos was due to graduate as a chaplain this weekend.

'My cousin had a couple of priorities in his life,' Ronnie Gonzalez told the Wall Street Journal from outside the Brooklyn home where Officer Ramos grew up.

'One was God, because he was a God-loving man,' said Mr Gonzalez.

'I wish I could be half the man my cousin was. He was sweet. He didn't deserve…to die.'
