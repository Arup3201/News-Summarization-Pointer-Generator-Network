England's 2003 World Cup-winning coach Sir Clive Woodward knows a thing or two about the Six Nations, having won the Championship three times during his seven-year tenure.

Here, the Sportsmail columnist previews the 2015 edition and predicts who will finish where...

ENGLAND 

It is crucial that England approach the Six Nations like a knockout competition because that is how they need to tackle the World Cup. In 2003 we ramped up the pressure on our players and challenged them to prepare for each game as if it was a World Cup semi-final. It’s time for Stuart Lancaster’s team to deliver.

ONE TO WATCH: Alex Corbisiero

Injuries have hampered him and he won’t play against Wales but the Northampton prop is up there with the best in the world. He is destructive in the tight and loose.

HEAD COACH: Stuart Lancaster

CAPTAIN: Chris Robshaw

MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Dylan Hartley — 61

HOME GROUND: Twickenham

Capacity: 82,000

SIX NATIONS RECORD

Tournament wins: 26 (10 shared)

Grand Slams: 12

2014 result: An opening defeat by France crushed Grand Slam hopes and the championship was lost on points difference.

PREDICTION: 2nd

The pressure is on Stuart Lancaster (second right) and his coaching team in World Cup year

WALES 

I liked Warren Gatland’s show of confidence in naming his team 48 hours early. It was an indication of how settled his side is and a statement that Wales don’t believe they have anything to hide or fear from England. I’d like to see more width on the ball but Wales clearly know their gameplan.

KEY MAN: Jonathan Davies

On the 2013 Lions tour Davies proved to be one of the finest centres in the world. He is exceptionally strong with a low centre of gravity but also has excellent hands and a good kicking game.

Jonathan Davies is regarded as one of the best centres in the world and is a key man for Wales

HEAD COACH: Warren Gatland

CAPTAIN: Sam Warburton

MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Gethin Jenkins — 110

HOME GROUND: Millennium Stadium

Capacity: 74,500

SIX NATIONS RECORD

Tournament wins: 26 (12 shared)

Grand Slams: 11

2014 result: The defending champions were well off the pace, losing to England and Ireland.

PREDICTION: 3rd

IRELAND 

Joe Schmidt is the outstanding coach in the northern hemisphere and it’s no coincidence he is working in a system which prioritises the national team. As a result, Ireland are in the best shape for years. But can they cope with the favourites’ tag?

ONE TO WATCH: Jonathan Sexton

The fly-half has struggled with concussion over the past year but looks as if he’ll be fit for Ireland’s second game. An exciting player who threatens with his pace and who has the all-round game to set his backline free.

HEAD COACH: Joe Schmidt

CAPTAIN: Paul O’Connell

MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Paul O’Connell — 96

HOME GROUND: Aviva Stadium

Capacity: 51,700

SIX NATIONS RECORD

Tournament wins: 12 (Nine shared)

Grand Slams: 2

2014 result: Despite losing to England, Ireland claimed the championship in Brian O’Driscoll’s final game.

PREDICTION: 1st

Joe Schmidt stands alongside captain Paul O'Connell with the trophy Ireland are defending this year

SCOTLAND 

Vern Cotter is a serious coach who has clearly knocked Scotland into shape, judging by their performances in the autumn when they pushed the All Blacks very close. Always highly committed but there are promising signs of their wide game developing.

ONE TO WATCH: Finn Russell

I love the young fly-half’s confidence and willingness to back himself, which shone through during the autumn. The 22-year-old has an excellent passing game and is fiercely committed in defence. A very talented player with a big future.

HEAD COACH: Vern Cotter

CAPTAIN: Greig Laidlaw

MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Sean Lamont — 91

HOME GROUND: Murrayfield

Capacity: 67,144

SIX NATIONS RECORD

Tournament wins: 14 (eight shared)

Grand Slams: 3

2014 result: Managed a solitary win against Italy by just a point to avoid the wooden spoon.

PREDICTION: 5th

New Zealander Vern Cotter took the Scotland job last year after eight successful seasons with Clermont

FRANCE 

Philippe Saint-Andre has an even more challenging relationship than Stuart Lancaster with his clubs and France’s national team are clearly suffering as a result. Their opening match in Paris against Scotland will be an emotional one and could set the tone for the Six Nations.

ONE TO WATCH: Camille Lopez

For years France have messed around playing scrum-halves at fly-half and vice-versa but finally seem to have settled on an out-an-out No 10. If Lopez can merit an extended run in the side it should pay huge dividends for Les Bleus.

HEAD COACH: Philipe Saint-Andre

CAPTAIN: Thierry Dusautoir

MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Nicolas Mas — 76

HOME GROUND: Stade de France

Capacity: 81,338

SIX NATIONS RECORD

Tournament wins: 17 (eight shared)

Grand Slams: 9

2014 result: Scraped a dramatic late win against England on day one but poor after that.

PREDICTION: 4th

ITALY 

Last year was extremely disappointing for Italy, which hinted for the first time in many years that their progress had stalled. They have some promising young players coming through but the loss of centre Gonzalo Canale is significant.

ONE TO WATCH: Sergio Parisse

Injury blighted last season for him but the 31-year-old remains arguably the best No 8 in the world — alongside Kieran Read of New Zealand. He is such a powerful athlete who carries superbly but combines his running with the footballing skills of an international centre.

Italy's captain Sergio Parisse has been consistently rated among the world's best players for years

HEAD COACH: Jacques Brunel

CAPTAIN: Sergio Parisse

MOST CAPPED PLAYER: Marco Bortolami — 110

HOME GROUND: Stadio Olimpico

Capacity: 82,307

SIX NATIONS RECORD

Tournament wins: 0

Grand Slams: 0

2014 result: After finishing 4th in 2013, Italy resumed their traditional place at the bottom of the pile.

PREDICTION: 6th

Head coach Jacques Brunel knows he must improve on Italy's dire showing at last year's Six Nations
