She regularly tops best dressed lists for her urban chic style and savvy fashion statements but Rihanna didn't quite make 'the cut' on the latest survey.

The 25-year-old singer's ‘Skrillex’ hairstyle has been voted the worst hair trend of the 21st Century.

The Barbadian singer, whose tresses have been compared to those of DJ Skrillex, scored 20 per cent of the vote, beating the likes of David Beckham’s cornrows and Kelly Osbourne’s Mohawk.

The Skrillex: Rihanna's shaved hairstyle, which has been dubbed 'The Skrillex' after the DJ, has been voted the worst hairstyle of the century

The ‘Skrillex’ trend consists of shaving one side of the head with the rest remaining long and has been made famous by celebs such as Rihanna and Avril Lavigne.

David Beckham’s cornrows narrowly missed out on being voted the worst locks, receiving 19 per cent of the vote.

Hair crimes: David Beckham's cornrows (circa 2003) and Kelly Osbourne's mohawk from 2001 were also among the top 10 worst hairstyles since 2000

In third place was Hollywood A-lister Scarlett Johansson and her infamous mullet followed by Kelly Osbourne’s Mohawk, which scored 16 per cent and 14 per cent respectively.

In fifth place was Cristiano Ronaldo’s ‘greasy’ hairstyle with 12 per cent, beating singing superstar Christina Aguilera and her dreadlocks into sixth place.

Justin Timberlake’s blonde curls trounced comedian Russell Brand’s unique hairstyle to be voted as the seventh worst hair trend with six per cent of the vote.

The final two places were taken up by music mogul Simon Cowell’s flattop middle parting and eccentric singer Nicki Minaj’s colourful hairstyles.

One respondent commented: 'What is with the fascination with the "Skrillex" haircut? All these celebrities think they’re so cool, but you can just see kids following this stupid trend.  How are they going to get jobs with a half shaven head?'

Another said: 'David Beckham has had some brilliant hairstyles but those cornrows were a shocker. It looks like Victoria dared him to do it. All those people who copied him should be ashamed of themselves.'

What were they thinking? Justin Timberlake's golden curls in 2000 and Nicki Minaj's never-ending colourful locks were also in the top ten

Francesca Davies from Fabriah.com, who carried out the study, said: 'I am not at all surprised the "Skrillex" look claimed the prize as the worst hair trend of the 21st Century.

'What is surprising however, is the number of people still copying the style. I would never have imagined the haircut becoming so popular.

'The list shows that even the most stylish celebrities can make a hair mistake, David Beckham’s cornrows and Christina Aguilera’s dreadlocks definitely spring to mind.'
