A British holidaymaker has died in a suspected hit-and-run as he and his wife rode a motor scooter on the last day of their trip to Thailand.

Bob Leedham, 58, a former amateur football official, was riding with wife Gemma on the Thai island of Koh Samui when tragedy struck on Sunday.

His wife sustained non-life threatening injuries and was hospitalised. A family member has flown out to Thailand to be with her.

'Best friends': Bob Leedham, 58, a former amateur football official, was riding with wife Gemma on the Thai island of Koh Samui when tragedy struck on Sunday

Bob, of Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, ran the 'Something Sweet' confectionery shop with his wife where floral tributes have been left this week. He was chairman of the Halifax Sunday Football League and was a referee for many years.

His sister, Carol Jackson, said: 'I believe it was a hit-and-run. The next thing Gemma knew was coming to in hospital and finding out that she had lost Bob.

'The whole family is devastated and crushed.'

The incident happened on the last day of the couple's two-week holiday and Gemma, 31, is being treated for minor head injuries and injuries to her arms and legs.

The family does not know the cause of Bob's death, but know that Gemma and Bob were wearing helmets.

Mrs Jackson thanked people for their incredible support, and said: 'Bob was the life and soul of the party and he enjoyed life to the full.

'He loved Gemma dearly and she was his rock. They were best friends.

'When you rang them at home there would be laughter, when you rang them at the shop there would be laughter.

'Nothing can bring Bob back, but the tributes that have come out have given us a lot of comfort.'

The couple were looking forward to celebrating their first wedding anniversary.

They were married in Borneo last March.

Halifax Sunday League president Malcolm Barrett said the community had lost 'a very popular fellow.'

Bob served as the referees appointment secretary and as an assessor, a Sunday League management committee member, vice-president and became chairman last year after Mr Barrett stood down.

'He will be missed, a nice fellow who always had time for everybody with a chat and a joke - he was known for his lousy jokes,' said Mr Barrett.

His death is the second tragedy to strike the family in just over a year after after Bob's son Kevin, a school teacher, died of a brain tumour in September 2012, aged just 36.

Bob leaves behind a sister, four brothers - David, Steven, Ian and Les - son Rob and granddaughter Grace.

Mrs Jackson said: 'What we have got to concentrate on now is what Bob would have wanted and that's looking after Gemma when she gets back, as well as Bob's son and granddaughter.

'That's got to be our main focus now.'

A spokesperson for the Foreign & Commonwealth Office said it was providing consular assistance to the families.
