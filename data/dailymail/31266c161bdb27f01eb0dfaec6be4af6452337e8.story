With the leading lady a 12-year-old cow called Ida and the story set against the backdrop of a Sussex dairy farm, it doesn't scream 'Oscar winner'.

But a documentary about maverick farmer Stephen Hook and his herd of 55 cows has won the hearts of the judges at Robert Redford's prestigious Sundance Film Festival.

He and director Andy Heathcote are set to rub shoulders with Hollywood A-listers after The Moon Man was chosen to represent Britain at this year's competition in Park City, Utah.

The real-life drama charts Stephen Hook's fight to keep his rural business afloat amid a constant battle with big supermarkets.

But it is his relationship with his herd, in particular Ida the Friesian cow, which steals the show.

The Moo Man will be pitched against rival offerings including Pussy Riot, a study of the three women whose struggles gained worldwide notoriety as they were jailed in Russia for their riotous performance in a Moscow cathedral.

Leading man and farmer Mr Hook has no doubts his herd of cows will tug at the heart strings and make the surprise UK entry a huge hit with critics at the international festival in Utah.

He said: 'I think it's a wonderful, laugh-out-loud film but I can't quite believe it has been selected to star at such a major festival. My life is as far from Pussy Riot as it's possible to get.

'So far The Moo Man has only been shown at a private viewing to 100 family and friends at a small cinema in Hailsham near the farm. But both the adults and kids seemed to love it.

'It made them laugh and cry at different scenes and everyone seemed enchanted by the story. Getting picked for the Sundance Festival is a very big deal and something we never ever thought possible in a million years.

'It's beautifully shot and the on-screen chemistry between me and my leading lady, a half-tonne Friesian cow called Ida, is entirely down to her. I didn't choose her as the star of the show, she is the queen of the herd and just took over.

'She was a natural show-off when the cameras started rolling. We joked that Ida was really milking her screen debut because she certainly liked the spotlight.'

The film took a painstaking 130 hours 
and two years to make at the picturesque farm where Mr Hook and his 
father Phil have worked for more than 20 years as a partnership 
producing organic milk.

And 
behind the scene-stealing qualities displayed by Ida and the herd are the
serious problems the family has faced to stay afloat.

Featured are long working days of milking duties and deliveries while big business interests try and undercut his efforts. But Steve knows every cow by name and says he shares a real bond with each animal.

In one scene he takes favourite cow Ida to nearby Eastbourne to try and generate more business with a beach photo shoot to find she enjoys the seaside so much she refuses to leave.

Steve also spends hours with a cow too weak to rejoin the herd after a difficult birth that creates a tear-jerking drama.

The Moo Man has been made by the small Sussex-based Trufflepig production company and will be screened at the Sundance Festival billed as 'You will never see cows the same way again.'

Director Andy Heathcote explained: 'We wanted to show the extraordinary bond we can still have with the animals we farm.

'It became obvious during filming that Steve has a wonderful relationship with his animals, a bond that most of us have forgotten can exist. But his way of life is seriously under threat.

'I live near the farm and thought it would make a compelling story, never expecting the recognition it is attracting.'

Making the movie meant shivering through mid winter milking, crouching in damp meadows for summer calvings and dodging the odd stampede.

Now Steve and Andy will travel to the festival, where the film is entered in the World Documentary section, this weekend. It has also been selected for the Berlin Film Festival.

The driving force behind the Sundance Film Festival, actor Robert Redford, started the event in 1978.

Steve added: 'I can't believe the company I will be keeping in the next few days. We have such a quiet life normally but we have a great film and I am sure it will be popular.

'It started being about one farmer bucking the trend and taking on the supermarkets but in the end what came across most strongly was the characters of the cows.

'Like humans they are all different characters. But they are beautiful animals and worthy of the red carpet treatment.'
