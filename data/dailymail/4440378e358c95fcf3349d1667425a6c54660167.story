Outgoing captain Thomas Vermaelen has used his Instagram account to thank the Arsenal fans for their support after leaving the club to join Barcelona.

Vermaelen, who joined the Gunners in 2009 and was made captain in 2012, said he had felt at home at the club, and has had a 'wonderful time' since joining.

The defender, who lost his place to Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker last season and decided to leave the club rather than stay on the bench, praised the entire set-up at Arsenal in the message.
