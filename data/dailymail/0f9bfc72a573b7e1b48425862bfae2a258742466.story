A 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' sequel will premiere on Netflix the same day it's out in theaters - in what could be a massive shift for the way we watch cinema.

'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Green Legend' - a sequel to the Academy-award-winning martial arts film released in 2000 - will hit screens big and small on August 28, 2015.

In the first deal of its kind, the Weinstein Company, which is chaired by Bob and Harvey Weinstein, will produce the film for Netflix and IMAX cinemas. It will not appear in other movie theaters.

Netflix hopes the deal will show Hollywood that the time has come for a new model for releasing films.

It will cost Netflix subscribers nothing extra to view the new release next year. A subscription to the service costs $8.99 a month. 

'The moviegoing experience is evolving quickly and profoundly, and Netflix is unquestionably at the forefront of that movement,' Harvey Weinstein said in a statement, CNN reported.

The companies said in a statement that the deal will give 'consumers and exhibitors around the world unparalleled flexibility in how, when and where they enjoy a major motion picture'.

The companies have not released the financial details of the deal.

No other studios, including Warner Bros. or 20th Century Fox, have yet expressed an interest in running premieres in homes and in cinemas simultaneously, CNN reported.

There are fears that a similar deal could sully relationships with theaters such as AMC and Regal Entertainment, which rely on ticket sales to stay in business.

Under current contracts, theaters - Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark - get to show movies for three months without competition. the New York Times reported.

Yet Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said he hoped that their partnership with the Weinsteins would encourage others to get behind the new model. 

'What I am hoping is that it will be a proof point that the sky doesn't fall,' Sarandos told the New York Times. 'These are two different experiences, like going to a football game and watching a football game on TV.'

Netflix has long said the model of screening films before they hit the small screen is old-fashioned.

'By the time we could watch a movie in the subscription window, it's a year after it's been in the theater,' Sarandos told CNN in an earlier interview. 

The company has so far had success with creating their own content, such as Orange is the New Black - and Sarandos suggested they might move this way for film, too. 

How the simultaneous release will affect earnings at the box office is yet to be determined.

The first 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' earned more than $210 million worldwide, and it ranks as the best-selling Chinese language film in domestic box office history.
