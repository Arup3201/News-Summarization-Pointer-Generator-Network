They stumble drunkenly through the streets night after night, fuelled by cheap cocktails and in the hope of having the night of their lives.

But for many of the revellers in the scandal-hit party resort of Magaluf, their nights will end passed out on a kerb, in a takeaway, or on a stretcher bound for hospital.

These pictures, taken this week at the resort on the Spanish island of Majorca, show the sad consequences of the drink-fuelled culture which shocked a nation.

Drunken: An unfortunate woman can be seen passed out on a kerb in Magaluf, which has been blighted by scandal

Bad end to the night: This woman has no friends to comfort her as she lies face-down on a tiled step in a takeaway on the Spanish island

Collapsed: A man lies sprawled on the pavement next to a Magaluf bar as his friend tries to look after him

One image shows a woman collapsed ingloriously the street as a concerned friend tries to rouse her and other tourists look on.

Another, less fortunate woman has seemingly been abandoned in a takeaway, where she has fallen asleep with her face on a tiled step in the centre of the dining area.

Elsewhere a man rests on a bench with his head slumped after a night of excess, while others are hoisted onto stretchers by emergency workers cleaning up after another night dominating by the antics of drunken British holidaymakers.

The posting on social media of a 21-year-old woman from Northern Ireland performing sex acts on 24 men in succession to win a cheap drink caused a national outcry - but seems to have done nothing to stop tourists flocking there. 

Indeed, many of those currently partying in the resort say the antics there are just a normal part of life, with some even trying to defend the resort in the face of its bad reputation.

It comes as even stars of The Only Way Is Essex have distanced themselves from the destination, cancelling an appearance at a party hosted by notorious pub crawl organisers Carnage Magaluf.

James 'Arg' Argent and Dan Osborne, who both feature in the hit ITV show, announced they would not be taking part in the event after footage of the incident emerged two weeks ago. 

Their spokesman said: 'Arg and Dan Osborne won't be going to the pool parties because they started filming a couple of weeks late and are behind schedule.

'Whether they take part in the pool parties in future is something we will look at, but they definitely won't be going on the pub crawl, which is what the public has a problem with.'

TV presenter Jeremy Kyle also fell foul of Magaluf this week when he was pepper-sprayed by a bouncer while trying to film one of the clubs.

The nightclub worker said he sprayed Kyle because he 'wasn't showing the good side of Magaluf'. 

One reveller on the island, 19-year-old Alex Brooks, of New Mills in the Peak District, said: 'I come for the night life, it's literally full of English people so it's just like being at home but abroad and with the sun.

Miss Brooks, a student, said: 'I have all my friends with me and we've come after just finishing our exams.

'We saw some people having sex on the beach, in the sea - that's probably the craziest thing I have seen the two times I've been here.

'People just don't give a s*** - they will just stand and have sex in front everyone else.

'Me personally, I wouldn't do that, but if they want to do that fair enough to them. I personally don't think that's right.'

Asked about the many young people that could be seen vomiting and passed out from drinking at the end of the night, Miss Brooks said: 'I think everyone has a point where they do that in their life and they learn from it.

'Whether back home in England or in Amsterdam, Berlin or here in Magaluf.

'For quite a lot of people it's in Magaluf and that's what gives it a bad reputation but it's not as bad as everybody makes out.

'We've seen just two people go off in ambulances and we expected it to just be ambulances the whole night long.'

Another tourist, Matt Riddles, 29, from Nottingham, said 'Everyone's out here for a party, things do happen, but that's life.

'Last year I went to Ibiza, it was a great time and wicked, a totally different atmosphere - more grown ups.

'Here it's the younger generation, probably can't handle their drink, but it's been alright.' 

Scandal hit the already notorious Magaluf seaside resort on the Spanish island of Majorca when a video showing a 21-year-old from County Armagh in Northern Ireland was released on social media.

Carnage Magaluf has said it is working with local authorities to make sure the scenes in the footage are not repeated after new regulation was introduced last week.

Outrage: Scandal struck the resort when footage emerged of a 21-year-old girl, pictured, performing sex acts on 24 men in succession in order to win a free drink 

The number of holidaymakers looking for hotels in shamed resort Magaluf soared in the aftermath of the town's recent sex and booze scandal, new figures have shown. 

Last week saw accommodation searches in Magaluf rise 24 per cent compared to the previous week, travel site trivago.co.uk said.

The spike in searches for hotel availability between now and the end of August could be down to the recent revelations about the party island.

However, travel experts at the site warned that an increase in bookings from youths enticed by the island's unsavoury image could be more than offset by concerned families looking elsewhere.

A spokesman said the search figures suggest 'some visitors were dissuaded by events in the media and perhaps the destination could benefit from cleaning up its image.'
