An MP has blasted Hartlepool United's manager after he revealed his desire to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. 

The club's manager Ronnie Moore this afternoon revealed his hopes of signing Evans, who was released from jail in October after serving half of a five-year sentence for rape but has refused to apologise to his victim or accept his guilt. 

Hartlepool MP Iain Wright said he was outraged at the prospect of Evans joining the club, calling the disgraced footballer a 'pariah'.

The Welsh forward had an offer to train with his former club Sheffield United retracted last month after a public outcry over the decision.

Despite the controversy, Hartlepool manager Ronnie Moore, who took over as boss of the club this week, said he was looking into signing the 25-year old. 

A furious Mr Wright said: 'I really hope we don't. I love my club, I love Hartlepool United. There's a reason why no other team in the Football League wants to sign him - he is a pariah. 

'I was at the match today. There were lots of young lads there supporting Hartlepool United. I just think it sends out such a wrong message to young men in terms of it being OK for a rapist to play football. It's entirely wrong.'

Moore revealed his desire to sign Evans after this afternoon's 1-1 home draw with Oxford United.

He said: 'It's a possibility. It could happen, I would want it to happen. He is a proven scorer; he's served his time and the boy wants to play football.

'If there is a chance he might come here, I don't see any reason why he shouldn't.

'He has made a mistake and maybe he hasn't apologised in the right way - and I know he has an appeal case pending - but if he gets on the park, he would go a long way to getting us out of trouble.' 

Campaign group End Violence Against Women Coalition called on Moore to carefully consider any possible move for Evans. 

Sarah Green, spokeswoman for the group, said: 'Ched Evans is an unrepentant convicted rapist.

'Any club who sign him need to think hard about the message they are sending to their fans, to the local community and to all football supporters in allowing him to rejoin the beautiful game.' 

Last month, television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron of Sheffield United after Evans was invited to train with the team.

Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk.

Sheffield United retracted their decision, saying in a statement that the club had not anticipated the 'intensity' of the public's reaction.

Hartlepool fans on the Poolie Bunker forum were split about the potential signing, with some suggesting the striker could help them escape relegation from the Football League, while others feared a backlash.

While some supporters of the Football League's bottom club took the view that a proven international goal scorer could fire them to safety, others feared a backlash.

PoolieinNottingham wrote: 'I really hope this is just a rumour. Thanks to Jeff Stelling (the Sky Sports presenter and Hartlepool fan) loads of people have a soft spot for Pools, whereas if this is true we'll get no end of bad will.

'If we've got money to spend on wages now there will be other players who can do the job instead of him.'

However, another fan replied: 'I would take him in a heartbeat, what's done is done, served his sentence, move on people!' 

Ched Evans has continued to protest his innocence with girlfriend Natasha Massey at his side

Evans made 13 appearances for Wales before his rape conviction, scoring one goal for the national side

In November, Evans was linked with a move to Tranmere Rovers after club chairman Mark Palios claimed he had turned down an approach from associates of the 25-year-old. 

Oldham Athletic have also debunked rumours that the club was considering signing him in recent weeks.

Evans was accused of rape in 2011 after having sex with a 19-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, at a hotel near his home town of Rhyl, Denbighshire.

Fellow footballer Clayton McDonald took the woman back to the hotel room before texting Evans, who arrived later. 

Evans had tried to claim the intercourse was consensual but a jury found otherwise. Mr McDonald was cleared of the same charge.

Since his release, Evans has continued to deny his guilt and is appealing the judgement. 

Meanwhile the victim has been forced to change her name and move away from her home after Evans' supporters 'outed' her online, breaching her right to anonymity as a victim of a sex crime.

Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, who was dating him at the time of the attack, has defended his actions and the pair are now engaged.

Ms Massey has insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for.
