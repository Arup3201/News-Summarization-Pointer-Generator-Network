How many people does it take to solve a Rubik's cube? The answer is 84 people - and a monkey and a snake - from eleven different countries, according to a filmmaker who took the puzzle on a trip around the world.

Nuseir Yassin set off on the trip after graduating from Harvard in economics in May, but he decided to take a bit of light entertainment with him - in the form of a Rubik's cube.

For the puzzle to be solved, each face must be returned to one colour. In order to allow people from all over the world to take part and decipher the code, Nuseir planned the moves beforehand.

He then asked people in each country to complete a single move under his instruction while he filmed them with his iPhone.

Nuseir also included some brilliant footage of a monkey playing with the cube and a snake slithering past. 

'When I asked people to do their move, I told them which move they have to take,' Yassin explained to The Huffington Post. 

'It's basically impossible to have people know what move to make if you just hand them a Rubik's Cube and say "go".'

Nuseir began his journey in England before moving on to other countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and his native Israel.

'I had to spend an average of 5 minutes demonstrating what I was asking from them.

'This is, after all, an odd thing to ask a random stranger. I'd say, eventually, I got much better at asking the right people to do the move.'

Despite only being able to speak Arabic and English, Nuseir was able to signal to people in other countries how to complete the cube.
