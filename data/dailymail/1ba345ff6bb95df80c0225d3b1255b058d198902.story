Vincent Kompany was benched by Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini for Wednesday night's visit of Leicester City.

The captain was one of five changes from the side that lost 2-1 at Liverpool on Sunday.

Kompany, 28, has been criticised for a series of high-profile errors.

Kompany has come in for criticism this season following a number of high-profile errors for the champions

He gave away a penalty against Arsenal, could have done better with both of Barcelona's goals in a 2-1 Champions League defeat and was dispossessed by Philippe Coutinho in the build up to Jordan Henderson's strike for Liverpool at Anfield.

A poll in the local newspaper, the Manchester Evening News, saw fans vote to drop Kompany from the squad.

Pellegrini has backed the Belgian, who he described as 'a great player', but rested him for the clash with Nigel Pearson's bottom-of-the-table visitors.

Midfield pair Samir Nasri and Fernandinho dropped out of the squad altogether while Pablo Zabaleta and Edin Dzeko were alongside Kompany on the bench.

Wilfried Bony, a £28m signing from Swansea City, made his full debut alongside Sergio Aguero while Martin Demichelis partnered Eliaquim Mangala at the heart of defence in place of Kompany.

Man City claimed a 2-0 victory over the Foxes courtesy of goals from David Silva and James Milner.
