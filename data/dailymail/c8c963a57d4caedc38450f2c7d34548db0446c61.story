Barcelona forward Lionel Messi does not usually struggle to find the back of the net and there is plenty of evidence to support this claim.  

Messi currently tops the all-time leading goalscoring charts for his club (391), La Liga (269) and the UEFA Champions League (75, including five hat-tricks). 

In 2012, he set the European record for most goals for club and country in a calendar year with 73, while in 2013, he achieved the unique feat of scoring in 33 consecutive top-flight matches. Based on this, it should come as no surprise that the 27-year-old is a four-time winner of FIFA's Ballon d'Or.

In 2012, Messi set the record for most goals for club and country in a calendar year, netting 73 times

However, Messi has struggled to score when playing in England with just two goals in 10 games 

Yet, for all Messi's incredible numbers, there is one freakish anomaly - his apparent hoodoo when playing in England.

Ten times Messi has lined up against English teams on English soil, but he has only managed to score twice, with Barcelona failing to win six of those games.

Given his tallies elsewhere, the return is comparatively modest and a peculiar aberration amid an otherwise inspiring c.v..

Barcelona face Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16 on Tuesday and it will be interesting to see whether Messi can overcome his English curse, or whether the torrid run can continue a while longer.  

Messi's two goals in England came against Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley and through a penalty against City the Etihad Stadium in the competition's round of 16 last term.

So far this season, Messi has scored 37 goals in 37 appearances for Barcelona and Argentina

Against Manchester City on Tuesday, Messi will hope to improve upon his underwhelming English record
