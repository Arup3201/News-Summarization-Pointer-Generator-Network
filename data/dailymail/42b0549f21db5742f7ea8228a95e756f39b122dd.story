The fat-shaming moment a daughter had to ask for a seat belt extension on a flight has seen her and her mother lose a combined 11 stone and turn their lives around.

Cheree Sartain, 24 and her mother, Paula, 46, from Corby, Northamptonshire, have transformed their lives since the time when they together weighed 35 stone.

Mortified Cheree, who weighed 19 stone, was about to set off on a holiday to Turkey with friends when she realised to her horror the seat belt didn't fit.

A flight attendant was forced to give her belt an extension but the humiliating moment was the motivation Cheree needed to begin tackling her weight.

Seeing her daughter's pain, Paula - who weighed just over 17 stone - vowed to join her child in the battle of the bulge.

The pair have now lost an incredible 11 stone between them, gained confidence and found a new lease of life.

Cheree, who weighed 19 stone, was about to set off on a holiday to Turkey with friends when she realised to her horror the seatbelt didn't fit

Paula, who was also over weight and suffering from diabetes as a result, was spurred on to lose weight after seeing her daughters embarrassment

Cheree said: 'I planned a holiday to Turkey with my friends but I was mortified when the plane seat belt didn't fit me.

'It was the most embarrassing moment of my life, I knew I needed to change my ways.

'The flight assistant kindly gave me a seat belt extension but my holiday was blighted by my low confidence.

'I hated my appearance; it was embarrassing being so big.'

Paula, right, recalls how her daughter's confidence hit rock bottom when she returned from Turkey

Paula said she originally didn't plan to stick to the diet herself, and went along simply to support her daughter

Cheree's mother Paula, recalls how her daughter's confidence hit rock bottom when she returned from Turkey.

Paula, who was suffering from diabetes caused by obesity said: 'Cheree was quietly thinking about ways to lose weight when she returned from holiday.

'Both of us were fed up of being overweight and I agreed to go along to Slimming World for a few weeks to support her but I had no intentions of sticking to it.'

Paula, who now weighs 12st 6lbs, after losing an amazing 4st 12lbs, no longer needs to inject herself with insulin, after her diabetes has rapidly improved.

Cheree, 24, a teaching assistant, was addicted to eating chocolate and crisps before joining Slimming world.

Cheree and Paula now loves being able to shop on the high street and socialise with confidence

She said: 'I've always been a chocoholic but never realised how out of hand my eating at become. I would binge on family sized chocolate bars at the weekend.

'My mum would also use a deep fat fryer when cooking for us, something we would never do now.'

In just one year Cheree has lost 5st 12Ibs, she now weighs 13st 2Ibs and enjoys being able to buy clothes on the high street.

Cheree said: 'For the first time me and mum can buy fashionable outfits, we've both got new wardrobes with flattering dresses.

'I went on holiday with my friends recently and I actually had to make the seat belt tighter I had lost that much weight.'

The pair supported each other through their weight loss journey and now feel like new women

Before they beat the bulge Cheree and Paula would shy away from socialising with friends, but now after shedding the pounds they feel as though they can conquer anything.

Paula, who has been supported by husband David, said: 'I'm planning a skydive this year, I feel like a new person now I've lost weight.

'Slimming World has shown us that you don't have to starve yourself to lose weight.

'Cheree is a chocoholic, so she keeps a box in the fridge for treats. You can also enjoy a glass of wine.'

Cheree and Paula now start with two Weetabix and skimmed milk for breakfast, a jacket potato with beans at lunchtime and a hearty dinner of chicken and vegetables.

Slimming World leader, Sonia Mathieson said: 'Paula and Cheree are such amazing women, I'm so proud of what they have achieved.

'When they first came to me they had no confidence and were really insecure. Cheree was so shy she couldn't even look me in the eye.

'I watched them transform into confident and I couldn't be happier for them.

'They are now supporting other women, I love them both to bits there is nothing more rewarding than watching two lovely ladies lose so much weight.

'Paula and Cheree have completely transformed their lives, they are healthier and happier.'
