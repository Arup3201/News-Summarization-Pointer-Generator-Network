Two alleged shooters were arrested this week in the 2009 deaths of a pregnant prostitute featured on HBO's Cathouse TV series and three others.

Suspected gang members Russell Hogshooter, 37, and Johnathan Cochran, 35, were caught on Wednesday in Delaware County, Oklahoma.

The victims included Brooke Phillips, 22, who had worked for a legal Nevada brothel called Moonlite Bunny Ranch, near Carson City, which was the subject of an HBO series.

Brooke Phillips, 22, a prostitute who appeared on an HBO series about a legal brothel was shot and stabbed to death in 2009 while she was pregnant

The other victims were Milagros Barrera, 22, Jennifer Ermey, 25, and 32-year-old Casey Mark Barrientos.

Barrientos, a drug dealer, was believed to be the target of the shooting.

Each of the victims was repeatedly shot and stabbed before their bodies were set on fire.

A friend of Miss Phillips, pictured here, said at the time of her death that she was not involved in drugs and had been in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

The friend said: 'Brooke never used drugs. She barely even drank. But she did date a drug dealer on and off.'

Denny Phillips, 36,  is scheduled to go to trial in the case in April. He's charged with six counts of first-degree murder because Miss Phillips and Miss Barrera were pregnant when they were killed. He is also charged with conspiracy to commit murder.

Phillips was allegedly a chief in the Indian Brotherhood gang and planned the killings. His former girlfriend said in court last year that he had bragged about the murders. 

'He liked to brag. When he was describing the murders, it sounded like bragging,' Kelsey Day testified in February 2013 at a preliminary hearing for Phillips.

Day, who was dating Phillips when the November 2009 killings occurred, said Phillips had provided details of the victims' deaths that made her believe that he was there.  

Phillips has pleaded not guilty and if convicted could face a death sentence or life in prison.

In 2012, David 'Hooligan' Allen Tyner, 33, pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and received consecutive life prison sentences.

Tyner, a member of the Cherokee Nation who had worked as a drug dealer's bodyguard, was arrested soon after the shootings when he was identified by a witness who managed to flee the drug den. 

The former Marine and cage fighter finally told detectives in the past few weeks that he had not committed the crimes alone,newsok.com reported. 

Federal Marshalls captured Hogshooter and Cochran on Wednesday. The pair, who are also believed to be in the Indian Brotherhood gang, have not yet been charged.

Hogshooter was found with a handgun when he was arrested.

Casey Barrientos, a drug dealer, was believed to be the target of the shooting which left four dead including two pregnant women 

Investigators allege Barrientos ran a drug and prostitution ring out of a south Oklahoma City house where the victims were killed. 

Phillips and Tyner allegedly were involved in illegal drug sales with Barrientos and plotted to kill him because they weren't happy with the amount of money they were being paid.

In May 2012, Tyner pleaded guilty to six counts of first-degree murder and was sentenced to consecutive life prison sentences without the possibility of parole in a plea agreement to avoid a possible death penalty. 

Michael Mease, a federal inmate serving time on a weapons charge, testified that he befriended Phillips while both were incarcerated at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 2012.

Phillips was serving a seven-year sentence on charges related to a shootout in Tulsa in April 2010. 

'He told me he was involved in the murders,' Mease testified last year. 'He told me it was over some bad drug business ... he said he wasn't there at the scene, but he was watching closely.'

Mease said he notified authorities of Phillips' statements because Phillips showed no remorse for the deaths of the women in the house, while noting that another man who had been inside the home had escaped when the gunfire began.

'That was unexpected, because everyone in the house was supposed to die,' Mease said. 

He said Phillips told him they were supposed to leave no witnesses.
