A nine-year-old boy who is dying from cystic fibrosis has been sent hundreds of thousands of Christmas cards in his bid to set the world record for the most ever received.

For the past month, Dalton Dingus has been getting cards from strangers from all over the world bearing the same wish - that he sets the Guinness world record before he succumbs to the disease.

So far, the youngster from Salyersville, Kentucky has received 504,269 cards, far exceeding the 205,120 cards received in 1992 - the last official time Guinness noted a Christmas card category.

Overwhelmed: Nine-year-old Dalton Dingus, who suffers from cystic fibrosis, has received hundreds of thousands of Christmas cards from strangers across the world wishing him a merry Christmas

But this astonishing achievement does not mean that Dalton has set an official record, as spokeswoman Jamie Panas told ABC that Guinness 'currently does not monitor a 
category for this'.

Still, the family is encouraging the cards to keep coming, in the hope that Guinness Records will re-open the category for his feat.

Cards stacked in the family's garage and swamping the home have come from as far afield as Germany, the Ukraine and South Korea in what his mother Jessica calls 'a Christmas miracle'.

The first few trickled in after a family friend wrote a post on Facebook asking for messages of support that Jessica Dingus could place on the mantlepiece for her sick son.

Plea: It originally started after a family 
friend posted on Facebook asking for cards bearing warm wishes that his 
parents, Jessica and Tommy, pictured, could put up in the home - and the
message went viral

Generosity: The youngster has received more than half a million cards, which no longer fit in his family home

Loved: UPS brought him 30,000 on Christmas Eve alone. Volunteers handpick ones for him to read

But as cards started coming in from neighbours and friends, the Facebook message began spreading across the social network and was picked up by local media.

With this boost came thousands more cards, including stacks hand-delivered by Miss Kentucky and Kentucky State Troopers.

On Christmas Eve alone, the postal service delivered 30,000 letters and 1,972 packages, some of which were crammed full with cards, David Walton, from the US Postal Service, told ABC.

In addition to these, services such as UPS and FedEx delivered hundreds more.

There are so many that the cards can longer fit in the family's 
home and the postal service can no longer fit them all into a truck.

Show of support: A stack of the cards was hand-delivered to Dalton by Kentucky state troopers

Battle: Dalton relies on a mask to help him breathe. Doctors said he had just days to live in October, but his mother said the cards have helped him become like he was before the illness really took hold, right

Instead, in another show of goodwill, a 
local television reporter has started filling a trailer to bring all 
the cards to Dalton's grandfather's church.

There, dozens of volunteers have been sifting through the thousands of letters, 
opening each one and saving special ones to take Dalton to read himself.

'One little girl said she wished he was her boyfriend,' volunteer Debra Williams said. 'The big majority of the town has sent cards or is helping out. Everyone just wants to do what we can.'

The youngster has stage four cystic fibrosis, which makes it near impossible to breathe. He takes 18 different medicines each day and wears a face mask to help him breath.

In October, doctors gave him just two to eight days to live, Jessica Dingus said.

Outpouring: The number of cards he has received has easily overtaken the last record in 1992 of 205,120

But 'he's doing pretty good now,' she said. 'It's just been the best Christmas ever.
He's excited for the first time in a long time. He's smiling more. He's
laughing more, he's beginning to become how he was two years ago.

'I think just knowing people really do care for him, that the cards let him know people love him, it has all helped.'

There is no time limit on when Dalton can stop receiving the cards, the Guinness spokesperson said.
