Arrest: Chad Johnson has been arrested in Florida for allegedly violating his probation

Former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson has been arrested for violating his probation stemming from a charge that he head-butted his wife last year.

Johnson, 35, turned himself in to authorities in Broward County, Florida on Monday after a warrant was put out for his arrest earlier this month.

It came after he failed to report to his probation officer on two separate occasions and failed to show proof of his enrollment in a domestic violence education class, police said.

He was arrested last August after his wife Evelyn Lozada claimed that he head-butted her after she confronted him about a receipt she found for a box of condoms.

The 38-year-old reality star was treated at a nearby hospital for a cut to her forehead and Johnson was charged with simple battery, domestic violence.

He was dropped from the Miami 
Dolphins the day after his arrest, but he avoided jail time after 
striking a plea deal with prosecutors.

He was placed on 12-months probation 
and ordered to attend domestic violence awareness classes after pleading
no contest to the misdemeanour charge on September 21.

On Monday, Johnson, who was formerly known as Chad Ochocinco, appeared in a Broward County courtroom and a judge found he was in violation of his probation, TMZ reported.

He has now been ordered to stay behind bars until he posts $1,000 bond and another hearing has been set for June 3.

Following the alleged altercation on August 11, Lozada, who features on the show 'Basketball Wives', promptly filed for divorce - just 41 days after their wedding.

Johnson later revealed that he was taking anger management classes following the incident.

He told Showtime's Inside the NFL: 'I'm trying to find out how can I channel my anger when I'm in situations to where I would pop off.'

Despite their rocky past, the former couple were seen holding hands on their way to a fan appreciation dinner in honour of Johnson in January.

And in February, Lozada revealed she’s still trying to heal from the relationship.

'We don’t communicate at all,' she said. 'We’re not at that point. Both of us are doing a whole lot of healing and soul searching and working on ourselves. I know I am and I hear that he is as well.

'We still do love each other. We were in a tough relationship and at times toxic. It’s still every emotional for the both of us,' she added.

Since their break up, Johnson been seen frolicking with a several different women, including chef Lauren Popeil.
