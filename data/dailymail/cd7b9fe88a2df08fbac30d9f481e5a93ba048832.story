They might taste scrumdiddlyumptious, but new Willy Wonka chocolate bars pack more calories than almost any other brand.

About to be launched by Nestle, Wonka’s Crème Brulee bar has 555 calories in every 100g – more than rivals from Cadbury’s Dairy Milk to Haagen-Dazs ice cream.

Health campaigners say the calorie count is ‘unimaginable’ and warn it could have a devastating effect on children’s health.

Scrundiddlyumptious: Netsle's Wonka bars- based on the Roald Dahl novel about the adventures inside a chocolate factory- pack a whopping 555 calories

Decadent: The bars come in three flavours, Crème Brulee, Millionaire's Shortbread and Chocolate Nice Cream. They contain more than a quarter of the recommended daily calorie intake

Nestle hopes to capitalise on the continuing popularity of Roald Dahl’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with three flavours of Wonka bar, even borrowing the author’s vocabulary to call it ‘scrumdiddlyumptious’.

But it says the core market will be women in their 30s and 40s.  

Small versions of the Millionaire’s Shortbread and Chocolate Nice Cream versions – under 40g – go on sale next month.

The 100g bars launching in October include the Crème Brulee version with 555 calories.

In contrast, a bar of Cadbury’s Dairy Milk contains 530 calories per 100g and Haagen-Dazs Belgian Chocolate ice cream just 285 calories in 100g.

Even the least calorific of the three Wonka flavours, the Chocolate Nice Cream Wonka bar, has 524 calories per 100g – more than a quarter of the recommended daily calorie intake for women.

Inspiration: Although Nestle say their new product is aimed at women in their 30s and 40s, the bars are rooted in the Roald Dahl book, which is read and loved by children. Charlie Bucket (played by Peter Ostrum, right) was given a Wonka bar by his grandad in the novel

World of pure imagination: Wonka's chocolate river is part of his fantasy world. Health campaigners said the bars could have 'devastating' effects because of their content

Nestle is pouring £3.6million into the launch and is targeting the bars at mothers aged 30 to 45 but admits they will be ‘perfect for the whole family’.

Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, described the calorie count as ‘unbelievable’ and said the use of words such as ‘scrumdiddlyumptious’ was clearly aimed at children.

‘I cannot see any reason or any guarantee that children won’t be getting hold of this – and for children it will be devastating.’

A spokesman for Nestle said the 100g bars were an ‘indulgent treat’ and that the labels make clear they were for sharing rather than for eating in one sitting. 

The firm said it takes seriously its resposibility to help it customers lead healthier lives.
