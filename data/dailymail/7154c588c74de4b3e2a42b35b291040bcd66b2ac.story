A little friendly competition can't hurt anyone.

But the most recent outburst from survival expert Ray Mears is perhaps a sign there's room for only one king of the jungle - and he'll be damned if it's his younger rival, Bear Grylls.

This week the outdoor survival expert launched an attack on Grylls, the UK's youngest ever Chief Scout, accusing the adventurer of setting a bad example with his wild stunts and dangerous advice.

The two survival experts have been in friendly competition ever since Grylls found fame with his television series 
Man vs. Wild, in 2006.

Mears, whose popular books and television programmes shed light on how to safely survive in the wild, this week accused Grylls of setting a poor example for young viewers who might imitate his dangerous stunts. 

He said: 'Leaping off cliffs into water when you don’t know what’s in it. If a 15-year-old was to copy him and impale himself on a pram leaping into a canal... because they were inspired by it, I would think that was his fault.'

The 49-year-old added: 'Some of his stunts are crazy.'

In an interview to promote his new autobiography, Mears said he started his career to enlighten people for safety reasons, rather than encourage the macho and 'militaristic' attitude which is often associated with survival in the wild.

His comments come just days after Bear
Grylls removed a steel water slide from his private island off the 
Welsh Coast after planning officials launched an investigation into its 
safety.

The grass 
covered slide stopped short several 
feet above rocky waters to encourage a fast drop.

Upon its construction Mr Grylls tweeted: 'New slide attached at home on our island! You hit the water very fast!!!!'.

This
is not the first time Eton-educated Grylls chief scout has been scathed by
Mears, who in 2008 described as 'a showman' and 'boyscout' 
before insisting he was the one to talk to for survival advice.

'I
think the viewer knows that if you want to really know how to take care
of yourself in the wild, I’m the person to talk to,' he said in a jibe 
directed at the son of Tory politican, Sir Michael Grylls.

Some of the latter's most famous stunts include urinating into a snakeskin and then drinking it to quench thirst in the desert, using the corpse of a sheep as a sleeping bag, and eating deer droppings.

Ray Mears' World of Survival premiered on British screens in 1997 and taught viewers a new survival skill in each episode, including how to rub sticks together to make fire to keep warm in the Arctic.

Mears travelled to seemingly inhabitable destinations in the series which was followed by a string of programmes such as Extreme Survival and Ray Mears Goes Walkabout.

In 2009 the outdoor expert from Kenley, London, faced claims he had inspired a teenage fan to bludgeon a pigeon to death.

He was carrying a copy of one of Mears' best selling books at the time.

Nineteen-year-old Raphael Thomas beat the bird with a skateboard before wringing its neck and putting it into his rucksack 'to eat later'.

Grylls faced controversy in 2007 when it was alleged the outdoor expert had been sleeping in hotels after filming in the wild had wrapped.

Ray
Mears has taught the basics of outdoor survivals on British television 
screens since the early 1990s. His programmes have taken him around the 
world to seemingly inhabitable environments from where he shows viewers 
how to survive by taking notes from natives.

Mears
survived a helicopter crash in 2005 while filming a documentary in 
Wyoming. He escaped the wreckage and rescued others, administering 
crucial first aid to a member of his film crew who was badly injured.

In
2010 the woodland expert was called upon by Northumbria Police to help 
track down Raoul Moat, a killer who was on the run after shooting three 
people. 

His 
most recent programme, Ray Mears Close Encounters, saw him track down 
and study two of the most dangerous animals in Australian wildlife - the
Tasmanian Devil and Saltwater crocodile.

Grylls became the youngest ever Chief Scout in the UK at the age of 35

Before
becoming a survival expert, the son of Sir Michael Grylls and Lady 
Sarah Grylls climbed the Himalayan mountains of Sikkim with the 
Indian army and trained with the SAS.

Eighteen
months after a crippling parachute accident broke his back, 
Grylls climbed Mount Everest before joining the world of television to 
eat bugs, free-climb waterfalls and wrestle wild animals.

Bear faced criticism after it was alleged the 
he was secretly retiring to hotels once filming had wrapped in wild locations.

In
2009 he was appointed Chief Scout by the Scout Association, making him 
the youngest man to receive the accolade in the UK's history, at the age
of 35.

Grylls has made headlines in recent weeks for creating a steel slide on his private island off the coast of Wales which has attracted concern from local Health and Safety officials.

His new programme, Escape From Hell, is scheduled to begin next month on the Discovery Channel.
