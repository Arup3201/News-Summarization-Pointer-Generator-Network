The family of Ebola patient Nina Pham has revealed how they pleaded with a judge to save her beloved spaniel Bentley, who is now in a secret location.

Health officials do not yet know if dogs can transmit the deadly virus - although research done by the CDC in 2005 showed they can catch it and do not show symptoms.

However, County Judge Clay Jenkins has agreed to let Pham's pet escape death, ordering Dallas Animal Services to take it to a secret quarantine for monitoring.

The divisive move will draw criticism from parts of the medical industry as Spanish vets chose to euthanize and incinerate the dog belonging to Ebola patient Teresa Romero.

Appeal: The 26-year-old's family made an emotional appeal to save Bentley as Pham is quarantined 

Defending his decision, Judge Jenkins told USA Today: 'When I met with her parents, they said: 'This dog is important to her, judge. Don't let anything happen to the dog'.

'If that dog has to be The Boy In The Plastic Bubble, we're going to take good care of that dog.'

The Boy In The Plastic Bubble is a 1976 made-for-TV movie starring John Travolta, which tells the story of a boy who has to live out of an incubator because he has such a poor immune system.

A similar appeal was made to Spanish authorities by the family of Teresa Romero, but health officials refused to run the risk.

The nurse's dog, Excalibur, was seized, euthanized and its remains incinerated on Wednesday sparking mass protests across Madrid. 

Research by the CDC found African dogs had caught the disease after scavenging from small dead animals in Ebola-hit villages.

However, the report stated that dogs do not show symptoms - and today they still do not know if they can pass the virus on to humans or other animals.

It is recognized as fact in the medical industry that humans can catch the disease by eating the meat of an infected animal.   

Transported: Dallas Animal Services officials wear normal clothes and no protection to remove the dog from Pham's Dallas apartment and take him to a secret location for monitoring as the mayor insists he will survive

Emergency: The World Health Organization has branded the outbreak the worst emergency of modern times

However, today Dallas spokesman Sana Syed today tweeted: 'Taking him [Bentley] to a safe place.

'Will share pics once we've shown the owner he's okay… He's adorable. Clearly a little puzzled by what's going on. But he's in good hands now and will be taken care of. Will update soon.'

Pham, 26, is being monitored round the clock in an isolation ward after catching the deadly virus despite while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan – the man who brought the disease to America. 

Her diagnosis shocked the CDC as she had been wearing protective overalls while working at the Dallas Presbyterian Hospital. 

The nurse, from Fort Worth, Texas, had been monitoring her condition following her contact with the Ebola patient and admitted herself to hospital on Friday after her temperature spiked – one of the first symptoms of the deadly virus. 

Her condition was described as 'clincally stable' on Monday.

A blood test confirmed she had the disease and she is now being treated in an isolation ward. The Emergency Room where she was admitted was cleared and decontaminated.

Controversial: There were protests across Spain after officials euthanized Excalibur, the dog belonging to Teresa Romero, a nurse who tested positive for the virus and is now being treated in Madrid

Outrage: Protesters marched the streets with signs reading, 'Excalibur - we won't forget, we won't forgive'

Anger: The crowds shouted 'Assassins!' after the controversial slaying of the dog who may have been infected

Memorial: 'Excalibur, now you are free!!! Rest in peace,' a tribute read outside Romero's apartment building

Nina Pham's uncle confirmed to MailOnline that she is the nurse who has contracted Ebola while treating patient zero Thomas Eric Duncan.

Jason Nguyen told MailOnline: 'Nina has contracted Ebola, she is my niece. Her mother called me on Saturday and told me; 'Nina has caught Ebola.'

'My sister is very upset, we all are. She said she was going up to the hospital in Dallas and I haven't heard from her since. I've tried to call but I can't get through. It's very shocking. I don't know any of the details, only what I hear on the news. It's frightening.'

He added: 'Nina is very hard working. She is always up at the hospital in Dallas.'

Kind-hearted: Pham graduated from Texas Christian University in 2010 with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing

A friend added: 'You always hear it on the news, but you don't expect someone you know so well to have it.'

HazChem teams spent the weekend fumigating her apartment in Dallas while health officials have ordered an investigation into how she contracted the disease.

Her beloved King Charles Spaniel will not be destroyed and is being quarantined, Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings has assured.

Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) Dr Thomas Frieden has blamed a 'breach in protocol' of infection control lead Miss Pham to catch Ebola.

Mr Duncan arrived in Texas from Liberia on September 20. He began showing symptoms of Ebola three days after his arrival and was admitted to Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Sunday 28. He died on Wednesday October 8.
