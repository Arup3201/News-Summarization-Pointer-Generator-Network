Team news

Southampton 

Shane Long could make his full Southampton debut against former club West Brom on Saturday after coming off the bench at Liverpool last weekend.

The Republic of Ireland forward moved to St Mary's from Hull earlier this month and, after featuring for 15 minutes in the 2-1 defeat at Anfield, is in contention to start at home to the Baggies.

Head in hands: Shane Long (left) missed a big chance to score on his Southampton debut at Liverpool

Fellow new signing Florin Gardos (hamstring) is still likely to miss out, with Gaston Ramirez (groin) and Jay Rodriguez (knee) definite absentees. Manager Ronald Koeman has also said goalkeeper Artur Boruc will not be considered for selection.

Provisional squad: Forster, Davis, Clyne, Yoshida, Gardos, Fonte, Hooiveld, Bertrand, Schneirderlin, Davis, Wanyama, Reed, Ward-Prowse, Isgrove, Taider, Cork, Tadic, Long, Pelle, Gallagher.

West Brom 

Central defender Joleon Lescott is unlikely to make his West Brom debut at Southampton despite returning to training after a knee injury.

Cristian Gamboa will not be considered to face the Saints either with Albion boss Alan Irvine eager to give the right-back more time to settle after his £2million move from Rosenborg.

No gamble: Joleon Lescott has returned to training but is unlikely to make his West Brom debut

James Morrison (knee) remains sidelined but Gareth McAuley could figure after a calf problem and record signing Brown Ideye is available for the Barclays Premier League match.

Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Wisdom, Olsson, McAuley, Dawson, Pocognoli, Davidson, Yacob, Baird, Dorrans, Roofe, O'Neil, Mulumbu, Brunt, Sessegnon, Gardner, Ideye, Anichebe, Berahino.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Southampton have only ever scored five goals in eight Premier League encounters with West Brom but three of those goals have resulted in 1-0 wins, including both matches last season.

With 13 goals in eight fixtures, matches between Southampton and WBA have averaged only 1.6 per game.

WBA’s Saido Berahino was the only player to score more than once in the opening round of Premier League games.

Dusan Tadic has provided three assists in his last three league games (2 for FC Twente, 1 for Southampton).

Saints have scored 11 goals in their last five Premier League home games.

Sing when you're winning: A late Rickie Lambert penalty helped Southampton win 1-0 at West Bromwich Albion on the opening day of last season

The Baggies have scored a total of only two goals in their last nine Premier League away games in August.

West Brom have never won a Premier League game away from home in August.

Southampton and WBA have both been involved in three high-scoring draws (2-2 or higher) in 2014, no club has experienced more this year.

James Ward-Prowse’s only Premier League assist at St Mary’s Stadium came almost exactly a year ago (August 24 2013).

Three teams were awarded a penalty on the opening day of the Premier League season but WBA were the only ones to score.
