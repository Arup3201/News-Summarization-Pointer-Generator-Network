Alan Greaves died after being attacked on his way to a Christmas Eve midnight mass

A fourth man has been arrested by detectives investigating the murder of a church organist.

Lay preacher Alan Greaves was making his way to Midnight Mass at St Saviour's Church, near his home in High Green, Sheffield, on Christmas Eve when he was attacked.

A 22-year-old local man was arrested this afternoon in Parson Cross, Sheffield, on suspicion of Mr Greaves's murder, South Yorkshire Police said.

The latest arrest follows that of a 21-year-old man from the High Green area of Sheffield last night. He remains in custody.

Police said the arrest came after an excellent public response to an appeal on Monday, when they released CCTV footage of two men filmed just before Mr Greaves, a 68-year-old grandfather, was attacked as he went to the church a few hundred yards away from his home on December 24.

Mr Greaves died from severe head injuries three days later.

More than 50 police officers have been working on the case but detectives have been unable to establish a motive for the killing.

A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said today: 'Detectives investigating the murder of High Green pensioner Alan Greaves have today arrested a second man on suspicion of murder.

'The 22-year-old man from High Green/Fox Hill area of Sheffield was arrested this afternoon in Parson Cross, Sheffield.'

Two other men, one in his 20s and one in his 40s, were arrested in connection with the murder last month and bailed pending further inquiries.

Independent charity Crimestoppers has put up a £10,000 reward to help find those responsible for Mr Greaves's death.

The reward will be available to anyone providing information to Crimestoppers leading to the arrest and conviction of any person or persons responsible for Mr Greaves's death.

Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick
said at an earlier press conference: 'Alan Greaves was a church organist 
with a strong religious faith and was on his way to church when he was 
assaulted.

He was a loving caring husband, father and grandfather who 
was well loved and respected by all who knew him.'

At a service after her husband's death, Mr Greaves's widow Maureen said she had wept over the 'evil that has been done'.

She told the congregation of St Saviour's she had felt their love and support since her husband died.

The
Bishop of Sheffield, who attended the service, paid tribute to the 
devout Anglican and lay preacher, saying the church had lost a ‘shining 
light’.

Thanking the congregation for their 
support, Mrs Greaves said: ‘I have prayed constantly for Alan and I know
you have too. I have not stopped crying for him and I know you have not
stopped either.

‘I have wept over the evil that has been done. I have prayed for you and I know you have prayed for me.

Support: Mrs Greaves, left, was comforted after she attended the church service where she thanked the congregation for their help, which was led by the Bishop of Sheffield Steven Croft, right

‘You were Alan’s Christian family and he loved belonging to this church. I have felt your love towards me.’

Mr Greaves, a former social worker who
leaves behind four children and two grandchildren, had played the organ
and preached at his local church for nine years.

He also played the piano for children 
at a primary school and had set up a food bank and community project for
disadvantaged people with his wife.

After the service, Dr Croft paid tribute to Mrs Greaves, who is an evangelist with the Church Army.

He said: ‘Maureen has been very impressive and courageous throughout this week.

‘I spoke to her on Friday morning and she was courageous then but in deep shock.’

After Mr Greaves died, Mrs Greaves, 63, said she did not seek vengeance.
