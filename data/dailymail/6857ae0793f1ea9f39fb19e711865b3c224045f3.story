A father and his two young sons have vanished without a trace during a road trip stretching across Queensland.

Stephen van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, left their home at Lota, in Brisbane's east, about midnight on December 11 bound for a holiday in Cairns, about 1700km away.

They were due to arrive on December 15 but never did.

Police say Mr Lonkhuyzen contacted his wife at Taroom on December 11 after he and his sons travelled inland to do some sightseeing.

'Police hold concerns for their whereabouts as it is totally out of character for them not to make regular contact with family,' a spokesman said in a statement.

The family are travelling in a white Mitsubishi Pajero with registration 426MCZ and are towing a trailer.

It is believed the car was last filled with fuel at Miles on December 11.

The trio left Taroom on December 11  and were due to arrive in Cairns four days later but never did
