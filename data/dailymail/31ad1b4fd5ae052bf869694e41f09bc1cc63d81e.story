The entertainment for tourists on the coast of Negril, Jamaica is somewhat jaw-dropping.

For this is where daredevil divers take to shanty wooden boards and dive some 100ft into the narrow pools of sea-water.

Rick's Cafe is a famous site where you can watch the skilled locals, as well as tourists, take their respective leaps of faith. 

The extent of the challenge is captured perfectly by the GoPro camera

In this incredible video shot with a GoPro camera, one local takes the diving to another level.

He spends about a minute taking in the surroundings and views as he perches aboard a self-made, wooden diving board.

There are swimming pools, boats out to sea, tourists soaking up the sun, cliffs and trees, at the tranquil resort. 

The true extent of the challenge he will take on becomes apparent - not only is he 100ft above the sea, but a closer look at his entry point into the water is grim viewing - the view is punctuated by deep-lying rocks.

A quick look into the lens, an exclamation of confidence, and then the Jamaican thrill-seeker leaps off the board, with camera in tow.

While some people are contemplating more relaxing activities, this diver is ready for a challenge

Tourists can dive from 35ft or so; the higher divers are left to the experts

The speed of travel and entry leaves the view in a bit of a haze before the camera pans to some underwater shots - capturing the many rocks on the sea bed that the diver manages to dodge.

'GoPro no problem Jamaica' shouts the delighted diver after bringing the camera to the surface. 

The action was captured after a tourist passed the camera to one of the skilled local divers.

Rick's Cafe on Negril, Jamaica, is a famous spot to watch cliff diving

'I'm just a guy with a GoPro who slipped a braver guy some bucks to jump off a rickety old platform, and then posted it on YouTube,' said the holidaymaker, named only as Gareth.

'My wife Keeley and I were on honeymoon and visited Rick's Cafe. 

'I believe the divers there make a living by being paid by offering tourists to dive with their GoPros. It was pretty impressive.'
