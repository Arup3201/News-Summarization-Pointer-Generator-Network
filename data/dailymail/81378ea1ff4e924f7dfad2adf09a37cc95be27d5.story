A British racehorse has become the first in history to be valued at £100million, an estimate which is considered 'conservative'.

Frankel, a three-year-old bay colt, has won all eight of his flat races and is the hot favourite for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot next weekend.

Frankel, who is kept at Warren Place Stables in Newmarket, Cambridgeshire, has already earned his owner £805,000 
in prize money and will bank close to £1million if he 
triumphs at Ascot.

Frankel, who can gallop at up to 40mph, has been dubbed the 'Usain Bolt' of the horse racing world. Here the Jamaican athlete celebrates winning the 200m at the World Athletics Championships in South Korea

The extraordinary  valuation is only partly down to his success on the track.

Frankel's worth also reflects the £100,000 'covering'
- the price charged for him to mate with a mare - that the horse will be able to command when he is put out to stud.

Currently the most expensive stud fee is between £70,000 - £80,000, charged by the owners of racing legend See The Stars.

The horse is owned by Saudi Prince Khalid Abdullah. Security around the animal is so tight his trainer, the highly respected Sir Henry Cecil, sleeps next to a video screen which streams live footage of Frankel in his box.

The valuation was calculated by McKeever Bloodstock, one of Britain's biggest bloodstock agencies.

Johnny
McKeever, who runs the company, said: 'Given the value of stallions now
it is not at all unreasonable to put this kind of price - or even a 
higher one - on Frankel.'

Nick Attenborough, a spokesman for horse racing industry body Racing For Change, agreed the estimate could be slightly modest.

He
said: 'At £100k a time and with him able to cover up to 120 mares in 
one breeding season it would only take him eight years to earn his owner
£100million, provided his offspring prove as good as he is.

'Frankel
is the perfect racehorse, he is very big and extremely powerful. When 
he gallops very few horses can keep up with him and he has incredible 
stamina.

Best in the business: Frankel's trainer Sir Henry Cecil has CCTV of the horse in its stable in Newmarket streamed to a monitor next to his bed

Frankel the champion horse is worth the equivalent of:

'He has such a huge stride that he often makes other very capable horses look slow. Frankel used to be very headstrong when he was young but he has calmed down and is maturing into a phenomenal horse.

'If anyone wanted to buy him today I expect they would have to find in excess of £75million to prise him out of the Prince's hands, but to be honest he doesn't need the money.'

Frankel was born in 2008 and is owned by Khalid Abdullah, a reclusive Saudi Arabian prince and multi-billionaire businessman.

The sheik has a history of breeding top quality horses and has also owned Known Fact, Zafonic, Rainbow Quest, Danehill, Dancing Brave and last year's Derby winner Workforce.

The champion horse's biggest achievement was taking victory by an incredible six lengths in the eight furlong 2000 Guineas, one of Europe's most prestigious Classic races, at Newmarket in April.

Frankel was quickly out in front in the usually highly competitive contest and finished unchallenged and impressively, ahead of second-placed Dubai Gold.
