A Playboy model has denied accusations leveled against her by former employees that she used their wages to fund her dream of working in the Los Angeles Playboy mansion, leaving them short tens of thousands of dollars in wages and superannuation.

Australian-born Jaqueline Summers, an international playmate and Playboy covergirl, owned her hair and beauty salon, Xotic, Logan, Queensland, until last year, when she allegedly closed down the business to pursue her dream of working for Hugh Hefner in the Playboy Mansion. 

Ms Summers has labeled the claims 'bitterness and jealousy on a whole new level,' denying the charges brought against her by former employee Candace Kingi.

Jaqueline Summers, an international playmate and Playboy covergirl, has denied she used former employees wages to fund her surgeries and travel to Los Angeles

Ms Kingi worked for Ms Summers for two years, and claims that the Playboy model owes over $50,000 in wages, superannuation, and rent, reportedA Current Affair. 

'She's taken advantage of myself and the other staff members...I'm exposing her for what she's done for us,' said Ms Kingi.

Ms Kingi claims that Ms Summers, a mother of two, took the money she owed her staff and her landlord, and used it to purchase plastic surgery, and a lavish international lifestyle.  

Ms Summers, who calls herself 'an international playmate', graced the covers of Playboy Slovakia, and used money that was legally entitled to her employees to fund her dream of becoming a full-time Playboy Bunny, claims A Current Affair.

In September 2014, Ms Summers closed down both of the hair and beauty salons she owned to move to Los Angeles, allegedly leaving several of her former employees short nearly $10,000.

Ms Summers responded to the claims made by her former employees on Facebook, posting that Ms Kingi was actually overpaid and 'out of love'.

Ms Summers told Daily Mail Australia that she had not been approached to share her side of the story, writing on Facebook that the claims were 'from the bottom of the toilet'.

'I will say those who know me well, know how bad this has been twisted from the truth, how bitter and jealous a lot of them have been for sometime,' wrote Ms Summers. 

Ms Kingi, who worked for Ms Summers for two years, said: 'I just want what's rightfully owed to myself and to the others as well. I want justice.

She said that she was 'truly flattered' 'that what Jaqueline does is such a huge factor in so many of their lives - how my decision to chase dreams became such a mission for others to destroy!'

'There was a lot of warning signs. One of them was the loss of the business, we were losing clients.' 

Ms Summers now claims to be working for the Playboy Bunnies, doing their hair and makeup in the Playboy Mansion, reported A Current Affair.

While Ms Kingi has text messages to allegedly prove communication between her and Ms Summers in regards to wages, Ms Summers said that she had tried to contact Ms Kingl but had received no reply.

Ms Kingi claims that she contacted the Australian Tax Office, and her superannuation fund, only to be told that neither had any records of payments being made by Ms Summers on her behalf.

The maximum breach for superannuation contravention is $51,000 for a company, and just over $10,000 for an individual.

Other former employees claim they are owed wages and superannuation by Ms Summers as well, with one claiming that only three superannuation payments were made in the two and a half years she worked for her.

'One of those contributions was only $0.51,' said the woman.

'Jaqueline Summers most definitely owes me around $15,000 in superannuation,' another former staff member told A Current Affair.

Ms Summers allegedly owes over $30,000 in rent to the landlord of her business.  

She said that she was 'truly  flattered' 'that what Jaqueline does is such a huge factor in so many of their lives - how my decision to chase dreams became such a mission for others to destroy!'

'Those who have stood & thrown stones - the truth behind you all will be exposed ..'

'Before you go jumping to conclusions - sit back and watch the next chapter because I'm sure you will all be interested too see what REALLY went on behind the closed walls of Xotic,' she wrote.

'The side these ex-employees forgot to mention .. Things I've kept my silence on..., Until now!'
