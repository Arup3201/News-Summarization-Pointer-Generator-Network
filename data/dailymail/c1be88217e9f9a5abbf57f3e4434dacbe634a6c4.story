This imaginative lemur used its own body as a makeshift hammock to take a nap when it grew tired on a trip through the trees.

The Sunda Flying Lemur, whose wingspan can reach up to five feet, looked very relaxed dozing in the afternoon sun in Sambas, Indonesia.

Clinging on to the branch with its arms and legs, the lemur extended its flexible back outwards - bending its body into a hammock shape.

This imaginative lemur was on a trip through the trees in Sambas, Indonesia, when it grew tired and decided to take a nap. Looking for maximum comfort - the clever animal used its own body to create a hammock

The sleepy creature hides from the afternoon sun by curling its head in towards its body, left, and is so relaxed when it wakes up that his tongue lolls out while he stretches out from the snooze

The snoozing lemur hung out for 15 minutes before it woke up to shift along the branch. The lemur was hanging five feet above the ground when photographer Hendy Mp, 25, captured the special moment

The sleepy animal then closed his eyes 
and rested its head on its makeshift support, before curling in on 
itself to block out the bright sunlight. It slept for 15 minutes before it woke up to shift along the branch.

The lemur was hanging five feet above the ground when photographer Hendy Mp, 25, captured the special moment.

He said: 'I first saw the lemur when it was already hanging from the branch.

'He shows his incredible strength and I had to keep quiet so it wasn't annoyed or scared by my appearance.

'It looks like the lemur is using its body as a hammock or a tent - I think it is such a cute picture.

'I was delighted when I captured it on camera - I'm glad I can keep the special moment of this rare animal forever.'

Mr Mp was only three feet away from the lemur when he took the photographs near where he lives in Sambas, Indonesia.

The clever animal is only 15 inches long and its tail is 10 inches long, while it weighs around 3lbs.
