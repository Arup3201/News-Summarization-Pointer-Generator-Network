Like millions of tech fans around the world President Obama would reportedly love to get his hands on a shiny new iPhone 5 for Christmas, but sadly for him his security advisers won't allow it.

Obama is instead being forced to carrying on using his trusty, yet now rather out-of-date, Blackberry device which is strictly limited to just 10 email contacts.

Speaking to a group of young people at the White House during a pitch for his healthcare reforms Obama quipped: 'I am not allowed, for security reasons, to have an iPhone'.

Tech savvy: President Obama taps out a message on his Blackberry last 
month. He will be using the trusty device for some time to come after being told he cannot have an iPhone for security reasons

The President said that both his daughters Sasha and Malia had iPhones and that they 'seem to spend a lot of time using them'.

Obama
famously managed to keep hold of his Blackberry after his 
inauguration in 2009, despite saying his security advisors would 'pry it
from his hands'.

But the 
earlier-generation smartphone has been locked down with only 10 people 
reportedly having access to his personal email account. Neither George W. Bush nor Bill Clinton used email during their presidencies.

Apple fan: President Obama checks his iPad during the East Asia Summit in November last year. He was reportedly gifted one of the tablets by Apple founder Steve Jobs

Obama is a known fan of the Apple iPad having been gifted one of the tablet devices but none other than Steve Jobs himself.

Although the exact reasons for denying the President an iPhone have not been released, it is feared such a high-tech device would pose a threat to both his personal and national security.

Even if he were not using the device to tap out any politically sensitive messages, if successfully hacked, it could act as a beacon and give away his real-time physical location.

Germany's Der Spiegel newspaper claims to have seen documents that revealed NSA agents loved the iphone because of sketchy scripts that allowed them to spy on 38 different features within the operating system.

Owing to a stronger encryption processes Blackberrys have enjoyed a better reputation for security than both Apple and Android.

In addition to this the President's Blackberry is limited to only 10 email contacts and is rumoured to have been heavily modified.

One
theory however is that the National Security Agency are particularly well aware of 
the problems with the IPhone's security because they have exploited them
as part of their clandestine PRISM surveillance program.

Apple was one of several tech companies 
that may have allowed the National Security Agency (NSA) direct access 
to servers containing customer data, according to revelations by former 
NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The companies deny the allegation.

BlackBerry, a Canadian company formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd, virtually invented the idea of on-the-go email, but lost its market stranglehold as rivals brought out more consumer-friendly devices, like Apple's iPhone and phones using Google's Android software.

The company recently halted plans to be sold and is trying to chart a new course by focusing on large business and government clients.

A spokesman for Kaspersky security software said: 'In the uneasy times of rapidly growing cyber-espionage attacks, there is no wonder why governments and high-profile institutions tend to be very careful and adopt strict security procedures.

'At this point, it appears a necessity to do a thorough security check of every single device that will be used to hold or transmit sensitive data, before handing it over to the high-profile government official, such as the President.

'There are two main vectors of risk; one is the software insecurities and vulnerabilities, that could be used by attackers to gain access to the device (e.g. in order to steal data, install spyware application, etc.); the second is the possibility of hardware backdoors or suspicious firmware changes, that could have been made to the device at the factory level.

'Auditing and approval of new devices must take into account all these concerns. This is especially true for high-profile organizations.

Nevertheless, the White House's movement doesn't necessarily mean that there is a serious security issue with iPhone in general.'
