Thousands of New Yorkers attempting to get back to work after Superstorm Sandy faced a second day of travel misery on Friday as buses and trains continued to run a limited service.

People streamed into the city as a handful of buses trundled through the city and subways opened in upper Manhattan and parts of Queens. No subways were operating below Manhattan's 34th Street in Manhattan.

The subway, buses and rail services were free again on Friday to encourage commuters to use public transport instead of driving into the city.

Two wheels good, four wheels bad: A commuter speeds past a long line of taxis and cars waiting to get fuel from a gas station in Midtown Manhattan, New York on Friday

Same story, different day: Commuters wait patiently for express buses to Manhattan from Brooklyn on Friday morning four days after Superstorm Sandy battered the city

Mayor Bloomberg ordered residents to share cars after heavy traffic crawled into Manhattan on Thursday. Police were turning away cars that carried fewer than three people.

At a Brooklyn arena, more than 1,000 people packed the sidewalk waiting 
for buses to Manhattan. When a bus pulled up, passengers rushed to the 
door.

A transit worker banged on a bus window, yelled at people inside, 
and then yelled at people in the line.

Frustration also mounted and tempers 
flared in gas lines. At a station near Brooklyn's Coney Island, almost 
100 cars lined up, while people shouted and honked. A station employee 
said he had been spat on and had coffee thrown at him.

Canny New Yorkers decided to beat the
 traffic on push bikes. Twitter user @BrooklynSpoke reported the 
Manhattan bridge, 'appeared to have three to four times its usual bike 
traffic' on Thursday.

Transportation Alternatives staff and
 volunteers and the NY Bicycle Ambassadors have set up commuter relief 
stops around the city where cyclists can get free coffee, encouragement, guidance and technical/material assistance.

It had been a similar story on 
Thursday. Commuters were forced to wait in long lines for the subway and
 buses before repeating the tediously long journey to get home.

He's got the right idea: A line of commuters snakes down the street as hundreds try to board buses at the 59th Street bridge in Queens, New York, on Thursday while a lone cyclist speeds past

People also lined up to use public telephones after Sandy left millions without cell phone coverage.

The roads into the city were 
gridlocked as frustrated commuters attempted to drive in to work. There 
were also the same long lines for gas.

In New York's Westchester County gas lines started as early as 6am. Dozens
 of cars snaked along the breakdown lane of an expressway waiting for 
gas at a rest stop in Yonkers.

Gridlock: Traffic backs up on 10th Avenue in Manhattan, New York on Thursday

Going nowhere: Cars sat in gridlocked traffic on the 59th Street / Queensboro Bridge heading towards Manhattan on Thursday

Gas lines: Drivers also had to line up for fuel at a gas station in New York City

Getting nasty: Tempers flared at the Gulf station at Flatbush Avenue and Kings Highway, as customers suspected the gas station attendant was pumping gas for a man who cut in line

Map of misery: The subway is not running between 34th St in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn but a limited service will operate from the Bronx, Queens and Upper Manhattan to Midtown and from Queens and parts of Brooklyn to Downtown Brooklyn on Friday

Happy Friday: The MTA service status on Friday morning showed severe disruption to subway and rail services

...And it wasn't looking much better on the buses on Friday morning, while the majority of bridges and tunnels were running with a good service 

On the other side of the highway, about 
30 cars lined up on an exit lane trying to get into a gas station, 
interrupting traffic.

New York City authorities said 35-year-old 
Sean Bailey, of Queens, was arrested after he tried to cut in line at a gas station in 
Queens on Thursday before pointing a gun at another motorist who 
complained.

Power outages and flooding 
from the storm have forced many gas stations to close and disrupted the 
flow of fuel from refineries to ones that are open.

Commuter hell: New York's subway system crawled back to limited service in parts of upper Manhattan and Queens after being shut down since Sunday

The decision to reopen 
undamaged parts of New York's transport system came as 
more than 4.6 million homes and businesses were still without power - down 
from a peak of 8.5 million.

Millions are also still without cell phone service after the storm, making communication with loved ones extremely difficult.

Because of the complete lack of 
service in many areas of New York and no power with which to charge 
their smartphones, the usually forlorn pay phones have been experiencing
 an unexpected surge in popularity in an era where wireless is king.

In
 an effort to ease communication hang-ups, rivals AT&T and T-Mobile 
have teamed together, opening up their networks to customers of the 
other company in New York and New Jersey where their services were hurt 
by power outages and flooding.

A
 full quarter of transmission sites in the tri-state area were knocked 
out by Sandy, according to the Federal Communications Commission, and it
 is unclear how many have since been restored since Monday night.

To alleviate some stress from the 
storm’s survivors, AT&T and T-Mobile said in a statement they had 
reached a network roaming agreement and that customers would not see any
 change to their current rate plans as a result of the roaming 
agreements.

Both 
operators use the same GSM wireless technology, which means that their 
phones can work on each other’s network. T-Mobile USA is a unit of 
Deutsche Telekom.

Six percent of Verizon’s service area was affected as of Tuesday and around 20 percent of Verizon’s network was down, the New York Times reported.

A spokesperson for the FCC said Tuesday that the outages could ‘get worse before they get better.’New
 Yorkers who were left literally and figuratively in the dark have 
relied on old-fashioned pay phones across the city to get in touch with 
family and friends. Many people from younger generations were unsure of 
how to use them, and payphones in certain neighborhoods, like Lower East
 Side and East Village, are easy targets for graffiti and misuse.

Many New Yorkers have also been unable to charge their phone after being left without power, this picture shows crowds charging their phone at a makeshift power stand set up by a TV company

Many
 city dwellers told the paper they hadn’t used the antiquated phones 
since the blackout of 2003, or the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Television
 marketer Jordan Spak, 32, was one such Manhattanite who relied on pay 
phones after he was cut off from his other electronic devices.

‘It’s funny what’s hiding in plain sight,’ he told the Journal. ‘It’s invisible, but when you need it,’ it’s there.
