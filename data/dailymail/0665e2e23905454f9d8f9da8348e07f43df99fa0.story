Tragic: Jake Fawcett, two,  was struck by a vehicle as he played on a farm in Cumbria

A two-year-old boy was killed after being struck by a vehicle as he played on a farm.

Jake Fawcett was left seriously injured after the horrific collision on a rural village in Cumbria.

The youngster was airlifted to hospital after emergency services were scrambled to the property but he died shortly after arriving.

His heartbroken family yesterday paid tribute to the ‘mischievous’ toddler and thanked friends and family for their support.

In a statement, they said: ‘Jake was a typical two-year-old who enjoyed getting into mischief with his twin sister Phoebe and older sister Annie.

‘He loved watching Peppa Pig, playing with his cousins and dunking biscuits in people’s tea.

'Jake will be dearly missed by all who knew him. We would just like to thank the community for the amazing support and kind words. Shine bright little man.’

Authorities yesterday said they had launched an investigation into the tragedy.

The incident unfolded on Saturday afternoon at a farm in the village of Gosforth, Cumbria, around three miles from the toddler’s family home in Seascale.

Police explicitly said that the vehicle involved in the incident was not a tractor but would not provide any more information on what type of vehicle was involved.

Cumbria Police said that two road ambulances, a rapid response car and the Great North Air Ambulance Service helicopter attended the scene before Jake was airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.

A spokesman said: ‘Police have begun an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident.

‘The family are being supported at this time by trained officers.’

A spokeswoman for the Health and Safety Executive said it had been made aware of the incident and it was making initial enquiries.
