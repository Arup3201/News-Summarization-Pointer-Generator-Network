A host of talented teen couples have created matching prom dresses and tuxes made out of duct tape, and 10 of them have qualified to the finals of the 14th annual Duck brand Stuck at Prom competition.

Gabrielle Farina, 19, and Ryan Danko, 18, from Pinckney, Michigan, spent almost 60 hours on the painstaking construction of their 1920s inspired ensembles; a dazzling flapper dress and matching tux.

And the pair, like the rest of the competition entrants, certainly made a splash when they wore their outfits to the Pinckney Community High prom.

The competition requires couples to make and wear outfits crafted from Duck brand duct tape to their spring proms and post pictures on its website.

Gabrielle and Ryan's geometric designs are accompanied by matching accessories, and to top it off, the outfits glow in the dark too.

The gifted couple ultimately hope to land themselves the top prize out of more than 150 entries, and a share in the $50,000 worth of college scholarship prizes.
