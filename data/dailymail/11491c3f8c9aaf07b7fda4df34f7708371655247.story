A Victorian terraced house which is completely covered in ivy and thought to be causing rat infestations is at the centre of a bitter row between neighbours.

The dilapidated home – which remarkably is occupied – cuts a strange sight in the otherwise clean and tidy street in Newburn, Newcastle.

Despite other properties in the street appearing well-kept, the front of the property is completely covered in a huge expanse of ivy which neighbours complain is plagued by rats.

The dilapidated ivy-clad property - which remarkably is occupied - is at the centre of a bitter row between neighbours in Derwent Avenue, Newburn, Newcastle, who are outraged at its 'disgusting' appearance

The ivy-clad building, left, is covered to such an extent its owner Kevin Roberts, pictured leaving the property right, can't even see out of the windows - but he refuses to cut it down and says he likes it just the way it is

The ivy-clad building, which is covered to such an extent its owner can't even see out of the windows, has caused ill-feeling between local residents, with neighbours outraged at the condition of the property.

Great-grandmother Ann Galbraith, 70, who has lived on the road her entire life, said she is 'disgusted' by the state of the house she lives directly next door to and said she has often seen rats crawling up the ivy.

The retired cleaner said: ‘The ivy is just bizarre, it completely covers the house.

‘I have seen rats crawling up it, they must be nesting in it.

‘My house is spotless, but I have had two baby rats in here, which must have come from next door.

Owner Kevin Roberts denies his house is a magnet for rats and vermin and claims he doesn't even have a kitchen - despite the fact neighbours claim to have seen rats climbing the ivy on the front of his home

The ivy-clad house, pictured far right, cuts a strange sight in the otherwise clean, tidy and well-kept street in Newburn, Newcastle, and neighbours are concerned it could affect house prices in the residential area

‘I feel dirty and I feel as though the 
house is dirty. It makes me not want to have my grandchildren in the 
house. I am disgusted by it.’

She said the house had once been well-kept and smart but after the owner's parents died around six years ago it fell into a state of disarray.

‘It used to be lovely. I was invited inside once and it was clean and tidy, but it is a complete disgrace.

Neighbours have described the property, pictured, as 'disgusting' and an 'embarrassment' but owner Kevin Roberts says he is doing no harm

‘I dread to think what the rooms are like. If it looks like that outside, then what must it look like inside?’ she said.

Another neighbour who did not wish to be named added: ‘It is an embarrassment, a total embarrassment to this street. Something needs to be done about.’

However, the owner of the house, Kevin Roberts, denies his house is a magnet for vermin and claims he doesn't even have a kitchen.

The 58-year-old former builder said it was after his parents died that he was evicted from his old home on the street and was forced to move into the ivy-clad building they had left behind.

He said: ‘The rats have nothing to do with me. I don't even have animals, I don't have a kitchen.

‘I don't have the money to fix the house. I am living in it but it is derelict.

‘The ivy is definitely not the problem, it is not what is attracting the rats. Other people on this road have animals.

‘I like the ivy. I don't care that I can't see out of the windows. In fact, I like it. It attracts all the birds. I wake up every morning to birdsong, it is lovely.

‘I don't care what anyone thinks, I am not doing anybody any harm.’

However, 74-year-old Derek Fairley, who lives opposite the house, strongly disagrees.

He said: ‘It is a serious problem and I am worried that I won't be able to sell my home because of the state of the house.’
