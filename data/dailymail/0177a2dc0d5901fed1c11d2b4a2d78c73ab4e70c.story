A prominent Australian grooming brand has been commended for including a gay kiss in a hair-styling commercial they released this week.

The advert depicts a young male character flicking through a sequence of Television channels, assuming the role of a string of iconic characters from different eras, including a 1920’s Hollywood star. 

It’s in this segment that the same sex kiss unfolds.The narrator, a news anchor-man, directs the protagonist to ‘kiss the hottest girl-or the hottest boy’ at which point he turns to a handsome man and passionately locks lips. 

The advert features a male protagonist sitting down to watch television, before he assumes the role of numerous iconic characters in cinema

The clip has received a flurry of support from numerous media outlets, who have praised the company for their inclusive depiction of romance.

Several outlets have pointed out that the scene is particularly surprising for Lynx, a company that is often perceived as misogynistic in their advertisements.

Lynx’s 'clean your balls' campaign in 2012 was banned by the Ads Standards Bureau after receiving a barrage of complaints about the degrading nature of the ad.

The Globe and Mail said the ad represents a broader shift towards equality in the advertising industry.

‘It is also a sign of a change that has been afoot in advertising for some time, but has accelerated in the past year or so: more and more advertisers are including more diverse portrayals of families and couples in their commercials.’
