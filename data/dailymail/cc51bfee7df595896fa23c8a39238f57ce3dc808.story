She once wore a dress made out of strips of beef and has also angered critics with a pink-dyed fur stole.

Now Lady Gaga has courted further controversy by wearing a bra with plastic assault-rifles for cups on stage.

It comes only a month after gunman Adam Lanza shot dead 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook junior school in Connecticut.

Singer Lady Gaga has worn a black bra with plastic assault rifles in each cup during her latest tour in North America

The 26-year-old singer has been seen in the outfit during the North American leg of her Born This Way Ball tour.

She teamed the bizarre bra with military green trousers and platform boots at a concert in Vancouver, Canada, on Saturday.

Lady Gaga is involved in a bitter feud with Sharon Osborne, who has criticised the singer for wearing fur and raw meat.

Mrs Osborne said she was ‘sickened’ when she saw Lady Gaga’s infamous meat dress at the 2010 MTV Music Video Awards. ‘When I see you wearing fur, and using it as a fashion statement, the fact that defenceless animals have been killed so you can get your picture in the press is abhorrent to me,’ she said in a letter to the singer.

‘Shouldn’t you be teaching your “little monster” fans to respect animals and life?’

But Lady Gaga has defended her outfit choices, saying: ‘I am choosing not to comment on whether or not the furs I purchase are faux fur-pile or real. You see a carcass, I see a museum pièce de résistance.’

Her latest outfit, left, comes a month after the Sandy Hook massacre, while outfits including the meat dress, right, have previously caused a stir

The singer has become well-known for her adventurous fashion sense, which she can often use to dramatic effect
