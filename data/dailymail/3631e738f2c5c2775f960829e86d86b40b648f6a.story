Having a day off sick proved to be the best tonic in the world for teenager Evan Hall, who shared a 'man hug' with Bruce Springsteen in front of 38,000 fans at the Ricoh stadium in Coventry.

The 19-year-old has become a global internet star himself after being plucked from the crowd to hug and dance with The Boss on stage.

The singer had spotted Evan's home-made sign asking 'Can I have man hug?' as he belted through a version of Hungry Heart, one of his biggest hits.

He beckoned him up and the warmth of the veteran rocker's embrace, 
Evan's joy and the ecstatic response from the audience made it the 
concert highlight.

But Evan
revealed that he only got the chance to make the cardboard sign the day
before because he was off work ill and had a bit of time on his hands.

'I'd
noticed at Bruce's previous concerts people have held up signs for song
requests but lately they had been getting a bit different so that's 
what I did.'

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;br/&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

The singer was belting out his hit Hungry Heart when he made fan Evan's wish come true last Thursday

He says he is still on a high after what he describes as 'the best moment of my life'.

'It's beyond anything else I have ever done before, I was hyperventilating, just so lovely, the audience reaction was brilliant.

'When I got on stage, I said to Bruce "thank you, so so much" and he was laughing. He told me to look at the great audience and said "this is what I see every day". It was just amazing.'

Evan had driven down to the Ricoh with his father Dale - a huge Springsteen fan who used to sing his baby son to sleep with the Boss’s hits -  from their home at Edwinstowe near Mansfield in Nottinghamshire.

They slept overnight in a Coventry car park before heading off to queue early and ensure they were right at the front of the stage.

'My dad thinks it's brilliant but when I came off stage, he said, "I've been waiting 30 years for that and it lands to you".'

Evan is no stranger to Coventry although it was his first visit to the Ricoh.

'I already liked Coventry. I do a lot of work there in care homes as a trainee fire and security alarms engineer.

'I've passed the Ricoh many times on my way in but I never thought it would be the place where I'd have the greatest moment of my life.'

He's been to seven Springsteen concerts but only one with girlfriend Zoe, who isn't a big fan.

Evan said: 'She was getting a bit sick of people contacting me at first. I've had calls from all over the world from fans wanting to talk about the concert.

'But when she saw the videos and saw how much joy it's given to people, she's found it very touching.'

Evan, who shares his name with Springsteen's eldest son, said memories of Hungry Heart and Coventry will stay with him for ever.

He has even earned a mention in the official Wrecking Ball tour notes which say: 'A fan caught Bruce’s attention with a sign asking, "Bruce, can I have a man hug?" Yes, you can… he was rewarded with not one but four hugs, and a little dance too. Bruce was working hard to keep his fans happy.'
