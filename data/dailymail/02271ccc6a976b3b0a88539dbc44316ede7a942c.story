It is one of the most common - albeit, ineptly used - elements of the English language.

Now, an American academic has suggested that the comma could be abolished as a punctuation mark.

Professor John McWhorter claims removing commas from most 
modern U.S. texts would cause 'little loss of clarity' - meaning they may 
now be in a state of obsolescence.

End of the comma? A U.S. academic has suggested that the comma could be abolished as a punctuation mark

He adds that internet users are becoming increasingly carefree in their use of the punctuation mark - with some professional writers following suit, according to The Times.

'[You] could take them out of a great deal of modern American texts and
 you would probably suffer so little loss of clarity that there could 
even be a case made for not using commas at all,' said Mr McWhorter, associate professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University.

He highlighted the punctuation mark's inconsistency as a further reason for its downfall - citing the Oxford comma, which is used before the word 'and' at the end of a list.

'Nobody has any reason for it that is scientifically sensible and 
logical in the sense that we know how hydrogen and oxygen combine to 
form water,' he told online magazine Slate:

'So these things are 
just fashions and conventions. They change over time.'

It comes as a local authority in Cambridge has been criticised over its decision to remove punctuation from street signs.

The policy - which abolishes the use of apostrophes - says that a road called St Paul’s Court would appear in all documentation and nameplates as 'St Pauls Court'.

Borrowed
 from Italian printers in the early 16th century, the comma replaced the
 virgule - a form of punctuation that looked like a diagonal slash - in the English language.

Until then, Tudor writers had used the rhythms of speech to determine their use of punctuation.

The comma is typically used to indicate an 
specific interpretation of the text - particularly in contexts where 
ambiguity might otherwise arise.

Its
 usage includes - but is not restricted to - singling out items in a 
list, separating clauses from one another, highlighting adjectives and setting out adverbs at the beginning of sentences.

However, there are several inconsistencies in the use of the punctuation mark - for example, the Oxford comma can be optionally used before the word 'and' at the end of a list.

It also bans street names which would be 'difficult to pronounce or awkward to spell' and any which 'could give offence' or would 'encourage defacing of nameplates'.

Last month, Kathy Salaman, director of Cambridge-based Good Grammar Company, condemned the the council - saying: 'I know some people think apostrophes are superfluous but we really need them and I think it’s the first step on a slippery slope.'

She added: 'If councils are getting rid of them, what kind of message does that give out to students at schools?'

Although similar in appearance to apostrophes, the comma is placed on the baseline of text.

Simon Horobin, professor of English language and literature at 
Magdalen College, Oxford, said a recent surge in technology had had a 'knock-on effect' on the comma - with the punctuation mark rarely featuring in text messages and 140-character Tweets. 

'The general tendency, especially online
 and in [text messages], is towards lighter punctuation, and this is 
clearly having a knock-on effect on the use of the comma,' he told The Times.

He added that 'splicing' - where commas are used to bind two grammatically 
separate sentences into one - and mistakes in 'bracketing' - where commas separate a subordinate clause from the rest of a 
sentence - are among the most common errors made in the use of commas.
