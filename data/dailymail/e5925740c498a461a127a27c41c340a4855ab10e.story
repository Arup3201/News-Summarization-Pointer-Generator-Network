Victorious: Flamboyant ex-celebrity photographer Darryn Lyons has become an Australian mayor

Winner: The Liberal party member took 70,795 votes after preferences, ahead of his nearest challenger Stephanie Asher by more than 12,600 votes

The 48-year-old looked teary-eyed as he spoke to the media, shortly after he was named the city's new mayor, saying: 'I love Geelong'.

When he announced his intention to run in the Australian state of Victoria he said he had learned from his time living in Britain that 'every election needs a comedy candidate,' reported The Age.

His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion
and change,' and he publicised his message with adverts, T-shirts, 
and a stream of public appearances.

Comfortable win: Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades - he arrived in London aged 22

Past: In 2011 he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother during which time bragged of his bedroom antics with a series of famous faces

In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World

Mr Lyons was victorious despite the fact he has lived in Europe for several decades - he arrived in London aged 22.

In 1992, Lyons founded picture agency 
Big Pictures, later gaining notoriety for selling a photograph of David 
Beckham and Rebecca Loos to the News Of The World.

Vision: His campaign slogan was 'vision, passion and change'

In 2011 he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother during which time bragged of his bedroom antics with a series of famous faces.

He even claimed to having spent the night with 12 girls at the same time.

The paparazzo told model Bobby Sabel: 'I once shared a bed with 12 girls. Those were the crazy days.'

On the Channel Five programme in which he came in sixth place, he also debuted his surgically-sculpted six pack.

The £4,000 procedure sees fat sucked 
out of specific areas of the torso to make it look as if the patient has
super-toned abdominal muscles without ever hitting the gym.

Talking about the procedure, Mr Lyons said: 'I had contouring done to my body.

'I
had to get really fit and lose a fair bit of weight. It takes away all 
the fat around it and actually lets your natural abs be there.

'Basically it's the male version of a boob job.'

Big Pictures went into administration last year with a string of debts, leaving 21 of his London-based staff without jobs.

But
back in Australia Mr Lyons set up Mr Paparazzi Celebrity Deals and 
established himself as a shareholder of another firm called BPGG Limited
– which promptly bought up the assets of Big Pictures from the 
administrators for £164,000.

He
appeared at the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics in 2012 and has also 
appeared on a series of television shows - including the Australian 
version of Dragons’ Den and an ITV reality series about the magazine 
business called Deadline.
