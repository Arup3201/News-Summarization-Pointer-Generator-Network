Authorities have identified the four people pulled from a popular Oregon reservoir as a grandmother, her two children and her 3-year-old grandson.

The bodies of two women and a 13-year-old boy were discovered on Tuesday, just a day after a 3-year-old boy was found and pronounced dead at Henry Hagg Lake, about 35 miles west of Portland.

Deputies identified the three bodies as Jova Ixtacua-Castano, 42, her daughter Gabriela Garcia-Ixtacua, 25, and son Michael Garcia-Ixtacua, 13.

The 3-year-old boy found Monday night was identified as Gabriela's son, Jeremy Scholl.

The family lived in nearby Hillsboro, where Michael was an eighth-grade student at Evergreen Middle School.

They had gone to the lake for a picnic on Monday.

The Washington County Sheriff searches for two adults and one child who may have drowned in Oregon

Deputies 
were called to Henry Hagg Lake, located outside of Gaston, Oregon, at 
around 6 pm on Monday evening, after two men who were out fishing 
spotted the body of a boy near the shoreline.

It was not clear exactly what happened to the family, but law enforcement officials said they found no sign of foul play.

'We're just considering this a tragic accident,' said Sgt. Bob Ray of the Washington County sheriff's office.

Because
 of its size of nearly 2 square miles, the lake has no lifeguards, but 
the sheriff's office uses a vessel on weekends for patrols.

The
 three bodies were discovered about 40 feet offshore in 8 feet of water,
 and about 50 yards from the spot where the 3-year-old was found.

Authorities
 worried about the rest of the family after they recovered the boy's 
body at the site Monday evening and found personal items nearby, 
including a beach towel, cooler, shoes, identification, as well as a 
small dog on a leash.

They
 also discovered that a vehicle left at the parking lot near the lake 
was owned by a family member. The family's neighbors and relatives told 
officials the four had gone to the lake and had not been heard from 
since.

The
 lake is a busy recreation site, drawing 800,000 visitors a year — 6,000
 a day on busy summer weekends, officials said. It also provides 
drinking water for Portland suburbs.

There
 have been previous drownings and near-drownings at Henry Hagg Lake, 
near the same area where the four family members were found.

That
 side of the lake can be dangerous because it has a steep drop-off 
formed by the channel of a former river bed running beneath the 
reservoir.

In
 2012, eight children nearly drowned after wading into the lake and 
stepping from that underwater drop-off. They were saved by six people at
 a family reunion who heard the children yelling and formed a human 
chain to pull them to shore.
