The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered an inspection of more than 1,000 Boeing 737, the most popular jet model used worldwide, to examine the tail planes for a potentially faulty part which could cause pilots to lose control of the aircraft if it failed.

The airworthiness directive issued by the FAA calls on airlines and other operators to replace tail plane fixing pins with improved pins following concerns over how their protective surface coating was applied.

The directive comes just days after a Boeing 737, the most commonly used aircraft in the world, crashed off the coast of Bali as the Lion Air flight lost control as the jet approached the runway.

It is not immediately believed the fixing pin was a factor in the accident, in which all 108 people aboard survived.

The FAA has ordered an inspection of more than 1,000 Boeing 737 jets after finding a potentially catastrophic problem with fixing pins on the tails

'We are issuing this AD to prevent premature failure of the attach pins, which could cause reduced structural integrity of the horizontal stabilizer to fuselage attachment, resulting in loss of control of the airplane,' the FAA said in the directive issued on Monday.

The airworthiness directive was posted on the website of Federal Register.

The FAA said the inspection was 'prompted by reports of an incorrect procedure used to apply the wear and corrosion protective surface coating to attach pins of the horizontal stabilizer rear spar.'

FAA said its directive affects 1,050 aircraft flown by U.S. carriers and may cost up to $10.1 million across the fleet, or up to $9,627 per aircraft.

The directive applies to models including 737-600, 737-700, 737-700C, 737-800, 737-900, and 737-900ER series aircraft.

The FAA order only applies to U.S.-based carriers but foreign governments may adopt similar inspections, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The order takes effect in late May and is not expected to have an impact on flight schedules.

This Boeing 737 crashed into the sea off the coast of Bali on Saturday but it is not believed to have been caused by the potentially faulty fixing pin

On Saturday, a Boeing 737 smashed into 
the sea off the coast of Bali. All 108 people aboard the Lion Air flight
survived and an investigation is underway to determine the crash's 
cause.

The pilot has described how he felt it 'dragged' down by wind while he struggled to regain control, a person familiar with the matter said.

Officials stress it is too early to say what caused the incident, which is being investigated by Indonesian authorities with the assistance of U.S. crash investigators and Boeing.

But initial debriefings, witness comments and weather bulletins have focused attention on the possibility of 'wind shear' or a downdraft from storm clouds known as a 'microburst.'

Although rare, experts say such violent and localized gusts can leave even the most modern jet helpless if they are stronger than the plane's ability to fly out of trouble - with the critical moments before landing among the most vulnerable.

News of the inspections come a little more than week after Boeing said its successful flight of a 787 should be the final test of the battery problems that have kept the plane grounded.

Boeing called the flight 'the final certification test for the new battery system.'

It will analyze the data and submit materials to the FAA, which will then decide whether Boeing's battery fix is good enough for airlines to safely fly it again.
