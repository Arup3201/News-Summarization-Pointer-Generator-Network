Preparing for the threat of invasion, Corporal Jones would often encourage his fellow Home Guard soldiers not to panic.

But members of the real-life Dad’s Army are thought to be behind the discovery of a rifle in a bell tower that has excited churchgoers. 

They uncovered this immaculate First World War rifle and box of live ammunition hidden under floorboards and then buried in sawdust. 

This is the gun and box of live ammunition that was found hidden in the bell tower at St Jame's Church in Bushey, Hertfordshire

Graham Clifton was fitting new frames for the church bells when he unearthed the weapon and a box of 20 live ammunition cartridges.

'I found a message on my phone from Graham to say he had found something,' said Sue Morton, Tower captain.

'So I dashed over there.'

'None of the bellringers would tell me anything when I arrived at the tower, they just asked me to go right up the spiral staircase to the bellchamber.

'That is where I met Graham and he showed me the rifle. We were just so surprised at what we had found.'

Ms Morton added: 'The mystery remains as to how and why it got there in the first place.

'One assumes it must have been a bellringer in order to have had access to that part of the tower.

'There have been various suggestions, possibly a rogue First World War bellringer who did not want to return his weapon at the end of the war, or maybe the tower was used as a look-out by the home guard and then, for some reason, it was left there.

'Perhaps we will never know.'

The rifle was taken away by the police to be made safe and it is hoped that it will return to the church.
