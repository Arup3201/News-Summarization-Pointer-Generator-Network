At 11.11.11 on 11.11.11 the 
time and date will be a perfect same-numbered palindrome, reading the 
same backwards as forwards - an event which can only happen on one day 
every 100 years.

But for Betsy and Katie Overman, 11.11.11 is an even more special day - their 11th birthday.

The twins, from Madison, Wisconsin, 
have already received their present from an aunt – a bag containing 11 
bags, each containing 11 little presents.

Special day: Betsy and Katie Overman will celebrate their 11th birthday on Friday, the 11th November, 2011

‘If we go to school, we'll stay for 11 minutes,’ Betsy told the Wisconsin State Journal.

‘Or they may count down on the school clock to 11 minutes after 11,’ Katie suggested.

Spoon-bending 'psychic' Uri Geller believes that thanks to its status as a 'balanced' number, '11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond'

The
twins, born 17 minutes apart on Saturday, Nov. 11, 2000, have been 
deemed the 'child messiah' by The Corduroy Appreciation Club, which 
recognizes 11.11.11 as the date that most closely resembles the 
material.

But Friday's date will also hold meaning for many others.

It will be:

The reason the date is so unusual is that 11.11.11 is the only double-figure palindromic date, since there is no 22nd month.

And
the last time it happened, on November 11 1911, an almost supernatural 
event saw temperatures drop by more than 60F in a single day.

This was the Great Blue Norther, a cold 
snap which hit the U.S. causing blizzards and tornadoes as well as 
record falls in temperature.

In Kansas City, it was as warm as 76F (24C) in the morning - but this had dropped to 11F (-12C) by the end of the day.

A new film being released on Friday, 
entitled simply 11-11-11, predicts that the day will see the opening of a
portal in to Hell, and says: 'On this day, innocent blood will spill.'

Remembrance: November 11 is best known in the UK as Armistice Day, or Veterans Day in the U.S.

The film by Darren Bousman, director 
of several entries in the Saw franchise, features a man whose family 
dies in a car crash at 11.11am, and who then begins to be haunted by the
number 11.

It plays on
beliefs long held by some spiritualists, who say that the number has a 
special significance and claim that many people have a mystical 
attraction to the time 11.11.

One group believes that 11.11 is the 
special symbol of the 'Spirit Guardians', a group of 1,111 celestial 
beings who supposedly look after mortals and manifest themselves in 
mid-morning.

Spoon-bending
'psychic' Uri Geller has written that the number represents 'the need 
to find balance in life', and added: 'When I see the number 1111, I pray
for sick children and world peace.'

Horror: This Friday sees the release of apocalyptic film 11-11-11, which predicts the opening of a Hellmouth

He also believes that thanks to its status as a 'balanced' number, '11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and 
the key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond'.

However, most of those who have chosen
this Friday as a day to get married are more attracted by the pleasing 
coincidence than by any deeper significance.

Gretna Green: The romantic town in the Scottish Borders will have an upswing in marriages on 11.11.11

The small town of Gretna Green, a 
traditional wedding venue near the border between Scotland and England, 
will host at least 50 weddings on 11.11.11, compared to fewer than a 
dozen on a typical November Friday.

Wedding
mania will be even more pronounced overseas, such as in India where 
thousands of couples have judged the date to be auspicious for a 
successful marriage.

Sarah
Bull, a Mail Online journalist who is getting married in Suffolk on 
Friday, said that it 'means a lot to be able to get married on such a 
historical date.'

She 
added: 'We chose 11.11.11 for our wedding day because it's a date which 
nobody, including my rather absent-minded fiancé, will ever forget.'

Like Betsy and Katie Overman, the day will also be one of celebration for a number of children who will be turning 11 on 11.11.11.

Trousers: One group which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the Corduroy Appreciation Club, which has anointed 11.11.11 as 'The Day That Most Resembles Corduroy' because it is made up of straight lines

For
Hannah Rose Hawkins, of Walton in Somerset, England it will be even more special, 
as she sees in her 11th birthday at her house - number 11.

Most famously, the 11th of November is 
Armistice Day in the UK - Veterans Day in the U.S. - when we celebrate 
the end of World War I and commemorate the victims of that war and 
subsequent ones.

The reason we ascribe significance to 11.11.11 is apophenia - the urge to find patterns in seemingly random data.

It is this that explains why we see clouds forming certain shapes, and why we often hear of people finding 'faces' in things like potato crisps.

Apophenia is also important in the psychology of gamblers. It can either encourage those on a winning streak to believe that it will continue, or convince losing gamblers that their luck must inevitably change.

While it can be a symptom of mental illness if taken to an extreme - as depicted in the film A Beautiful Mind - apophenia is instinctive to all humans as a way of drawing conclusions about the world.

This phenomenon helps us, for example, to recognise abstract drawings as representing human figures, and to remember phone numbers which seem to follow a pattern.

The end of the Great War came on November 11, 1918. Given the carnage seen in the war, we can assume that the date was not deliberately chosen, but was simply the earliest possible opportunity for a ceasefire.

However, the decision to end the war at exactly 11 o'clock certainly was deliberate, at the Armistice was signed around five in the morning (Paris time), to take effect at the symbolic point a few hours later.

Tragically, fierce fighting continued right up until the official ceasefire, and one American soldier was killed at 10.58.

Of course, there is no real significance to the date 11.11.11 - not even at the time of 11.11.11 - but it is a classic example of apophenia, the human urge to see patterns in essentially random events.

With that in mind, perhaps the group 
which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the Corduroy 
Appreciation Club, which has anointed 11.11.11 as 'The Day That Most 
Resembles Corduroy' because it is made up of straight lines.

However,
to say that the date is no more than a coincidence would have provided 
little comfort to those who endured the bizarre weather on the last 
11.11.11.

It remains to be 
seen whether 11.11.11 will produce such surprises this time around, but 
people should be sure to keep a careful eye on the weather - and on any 
local Hellmouths - at 11 seconds past 11 minutes past 11 o'clock.
