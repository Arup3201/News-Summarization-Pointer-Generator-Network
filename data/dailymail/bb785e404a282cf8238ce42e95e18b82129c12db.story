Google executive Forrest Tim Hayes had extramarital relations with girls besides Alix Tichelman before he died, and the captain of the yacht who discovered his body may have tampered with evidence, police said today.

The body of the married father of five was discovered after he had been injected with heroin by call girl Tichelman – who then fled the scene – on November 23, but police say they have evidence he had also been seeing other women.

Santa Cruz Deputy Chief of Police Steve Clark exclusively told MailOnline: ‘We’re aware that he had other liaisons.’

'He was meeting with people. And this wasn’t his first encounter with her.’

Heartless: Alix Tichelman, 26, appeared in Santa Cruz court on Wednesday to face manslaughter and drug charges in relation to the November 2013 death of Google executive Forrest Hayes. Prosecutors are accusing Tichelman, a call girl, of leaving Hayes to die of a drug overdose

Meanwhile, we can reveal police suspect the captain 
who found Hayes’ body tidied up
 the boat after he found Hayes’ body. On the night of his death, the 
50ft yacht had not left Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor.

‘The
 captain is the one who reported finding his body,' Clark told MailOnline. 'The boat was in 
pretty clean condition when we found it and we suspect he may have tried
 to clean things up a bit.

‘He
 did hinder the investigation initially, and it cost us a little bit of 
time. I understand why he did it, he has a professional reputation, he 
has high-end, wealthy clients, I’m sure he is paid well and part of that
 payment is for his discretion,’ he added.

The
 captain also told police the main cabin camera, which allegedly showed 
Tichelman failing to help Hayes after his overdose, calmly finishing her
 glass of wine then collecting her things before leaving the scene, 
wasn’t working.

‘The camera that was in the cabin and would show us what had happened - he told us it didn’t work,’ Clark said.

Santa
 Cruz police later found the video footage had all been stored on a 
remote server in a media cloud, and managed to get a court order and 
release a copy from the technology company that had set it up.

Other flings: Santa Cruz Deputy Chief of Police Steve Clark exclusively told MailOnline that Hayes  'had other liaisons'

Tichelman, 26, is accused of heartlessly leaving a client to die from a drug overdose, 
wrote about her 'love' of killing sprees in a Facebook post published 
just days before her July 4 arrest.

She appeared in Santa Cruz court on Wednesday to face 
manslaughter and drug charges in connection to the November 2013 death 
of Hayes, 51.

Deputy Chief of Police Clark told MailOnline Clark that when she was arrested Tichelman was ‘shocked’ but started to reveal her ‘callous’ side during interview.

He
 added: ‘It was pretty clear that her self-centered nature came through 
in this interview, as it did in her committing the crime as well.

‘She
 has had contact with people on the outside who she has been encouraging
 to remove her social media information. She’s still trying to cover her
 tracks and cover evidence which might implicate her.

‘It’s
 shocking from the perspective of how callous and uncaring she was. That
 she could be so cold and not even cry out for help or call 911 or try 
to revive him in any way, it shows the type of person and how egocentric
 she was.’

Surveillance
 footage obtained by investigators shows Tichelman injecting Hayes with 
heroin, and then casually leaving him to die when he has an adverse 
reaction to the drug.

And this may not have been Tichelman's first killing, as detectives are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state.

According to a report by Fox News, Tichelman had phoned up 911 and reported the heroin overdose death of  a man named Dean Riopelle. Police in Milton Georgia are taking another look at the case.

In another case, according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel, Tichelman may have dated the lead singer of the Atlanta-based group, The Judies, Warren Ullom, who was sent  to prison for manslaughter for a heroin overdose.

Stone cold: The high-priced prostitute didn't look worried when she appeared in court on July 9

No plea yet: Tichelman has not yet entered a plea, and was assigned a public defender in court on Wednesday

Tichelman was apparently fascinated with the topic of serial murders, according to posts she wrote on Facebook just last month.

'Really
 nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in 
cold blood...and they love it too,' she wrote in a June 28 post.

'No judgement, Yay! F*** all of that positivity bulls***. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die,' she added.

In court on Wednesday, Tichelman did not enter a plea and was assigned a public defender.

Tichelman has been held on $1.5million bond since her July 4 arrest, when she met with an undercover cop at a Santa Cruz hotel who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex.

The high-priced prostitute allegedly met Hayes, the married father of five, on website 'Seeking Arrangement' which pairs 'sugar babies' with rich older men or women.

Police say the two met a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter.

That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said.

Scene: She allegedly took the heroin to his yacht, pictured, and administered the drug but as he lay dying, she stepped over his body to finish a glass of wine before leaving the boat

Surveillance video from inside the luxury boat shows Hayes 'suffering medical complications' and losing consciousness - but Tichelman makes no attempt to help him or call 911, police said.

Instead, she is seen gathering her belongings, stepping over his dying body to finish her glass of wine and then leaving the boat - pulling a window blind down to conceal his body from outside.

Hayes was found dead the next morning by the boat's captain, the Santa Cruz Sentinel reported.

'She showed no regard for him. She was just trying to cover her tracks,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark said on Tuesday.

Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident and uncovered Tichelman's correspondence with the victim.

'We know they've had a previous 
relationship, they've shared time together before,' Clark told KION.

'This was all set up 
through text messages and emails. We also know what she did in the 
aftermath of this. We have her computer records, we know the Google 
searches that she made, the things she did to try to get herself out of 
this.'

Fetish fan: Tichelman was arrested on Friday after police posed as a client and met her at a hotel

Police identified Tichelman from the video and also found her fingerprints on the wine glass, police said.

They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County for the July 4 arrest.

When asked if the overdose was accidental or intentional, Clark said evidence showed a level of guilt that reached second-degree murder rather than involuntary manslaughter, the Sentinel reported.

'She showed
 absolutely no regard for this person she injected with heroin,' Clark 
said. 'She had a responsibility to provide some lifesaving effort.'

Detectives said they are also investigating Tichelman for a similar death in another state.

Hayes,
 who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to 
wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his 
obituary.

He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google.

'Forrest
 will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than 
anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on 
his boat,' according to a January obituary.

'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.'

Tichelman's
 Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before 
majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty 
school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist

According to Tichelman's Facebook, she went to high school in Atlanta before attending George State University and then beauty school. She listed her occupation as a makeup artist

She called herself a 'model' in jail records.

On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera, and posts suggest she had a boyfriend as recently as a couple of months ago.

In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character.

'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an "intense child" and already liked horror movies.'

She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her nightclub owner boyfriend.

She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the TV show about a serial killer, 'Dexter'.

Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.
