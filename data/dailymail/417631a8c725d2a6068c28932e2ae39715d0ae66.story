If your attempts at dancing are confined to an awkward stumble at the office Christmas party, it might be time to take some advice from the experts. And who better than Strictly Come Dancing judges Len Goodman and Darcey Bussell?

To help correct flailing limbs and cheesy disco moves, the pair have compiled a list of ten top tips for ungainly novices. A former principal dancer at the Royal Ballet, Miss Bussell told the Christmas Radio Times: ‘When I’m not on stage I make a fool of myself on the dance floor quite happily.’

But in the spirit of Christmas, she and Goodman are happy to pass on the results of their considerable experience …

DO... find the perfect dance partner

Darcey says: 'Copy shamelessly. Find someone who is looking good and dance next to them, then you can copy their moves and see that what you are doing works with the music.

DON'T... be a pest

If the dance floor is crowded, don't flail about playing the air guitar.

DO... throw caution to the wind

Darcey says: 'When I'm not on stage I make a fool of myself on the dance floor quite happily. It's very liberating not to worry about perfecting every step and technique.

DON'T... raise your arms

Never bring your arms above your head - keep them below shoulder height at all times. You're dancing, not drowning.

DO... try dancing to everything

Darcey says: 'I love Latin music - the Gipsy Kings always have me on my feet - but I'll try it all! Listen for the back beat and start clapping your hands and moving your feet.

DO... have a drink

If you're nervous, have a couple to fortify yourself! It can sometimes work against you, but as long as you enjoy yourself it doesn't matter.

DON'T... do the twist in a very short skirt

And if you're in a strapless top don't lift your arms up too far.

DO hide behind others:

Never be the first on the dance floor… ever!

Wait until there are a few people out there who know what they’re doing.

DON'T sit on the dance floor:

Pretending to row a boat, for example, especially when you’re drunk and can’t get back up again, is never acceptable.  

DO keep yourself to yourself:

Step to the side and tap and then step to the other side and tap - that works to any song and always looks good.

The Christmas Radio Times is out now.
