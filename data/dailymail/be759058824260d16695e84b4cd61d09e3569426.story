American troops in Afghanistan were at the centre of new controversy and bitter protests tonight after claims US soldiers had burned copies of the Koran among rubbish.

More than 2,000 furious Afghans - some chanting ‘die, die foreigners’, other throwing rocks - gathered outside the giant US air base at Bagram, 40 miles north of the capital Kabul, as reports of the burning spread.

The US commander of Nato troops in Afghanistan, General John Allen, was forced to apologise over the claims that foreign troops had ‘improperly disposed’ of copies of the Koran.

But there were immediate fears the Taliban and other insurgent groups would try to exploit the claims, using it as a rallying call against US, British and fellow Coalition forces.

Last year at least 10 United Nations 
workers were killed and dozens of other people injured in protests 
triggered in Afghanistan by an American preacher setting fire to the 
Koran in Florida.

And it comes only weeks after US and 
UN officials condemned a video clip of US marine snipers urinating on 
dead Afghans as ‘disgusting’ and ‘inhuman.’

Announcing an immediate 
investigation, Gen. Allen stressed the incident was ‘not intentional in 
any way.’

However, it stoked anti-foreign sentiment that already is on 
the rise after nearly a decade of war in Afghanistan and fuelled the 
arguments of Afghans who believe foreign troops are not respectful of 
their culture or Islamic religion.

Other religious items were reported to have been among the packages burned by the two soldiers.

As word of the incident spread, 
demonstrators gathered outside the sprawling Bagram Air Field, in Parwan
province. As the crowd grew, so did the outrage.

U.S. helicopters fired flares to try 
to break up the protests and while some demonstrators shouted their 
hatred, others fired hunting guns into the air. Groups threw rocks at 
the gate of the base.

‘We Afghans don’t want these 
Christians and infidels, they are the enemy of our soil, our honour and 
our Koran,’ said Haji Shirin, one of the protesters.

‘I urge all Muslims to sacrifice themselves in order to pull out these troops from this soil.’

Bagram also houses a prison for 
Afghans detained by US forces. The centre has caused resentment among 
Afghans because of reports of torture and ill-treatment of suspected 
Taliban prisoners, with President Hamid Karzai demanding the transfer of
prisoners to Afghan security.

Ahmad Zaki Zahed, chief of the 
provincial council, said U.S. military officials took him to a ‘burn 
pit’ on the base where 60 to 70 books, including Korans, were recovered.
The books were used by detainees once incarcerated at the base, he 
said.

‘Some were all burned, some were 
half-burned,’ Zahed said, adding that he did not know exactly how many 
Korans, the Muslim holy book, had been burned.

Zahed said five Afghans working at 
the pit told him that the religious books were in the rubbish that two 
soldiers with the U.S.-led coalition transported to the pit in a truck 
late on Monday night. When they realized the books were in the rubbish, 
the labourers worked to recover them, he said.

‘The labourers there showed me how their fingers were burned when they took the books out of the fire,’ he said.

In an unusally candid statement, Gen.
Allen said : ‘I offer my sincere apologies for any offence this may 
have caused, to the president of Afghanistan, the government of the 
Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and most importantly, to the noble 
people of Afghanistan.’

A military official says the books were burned because they contained extremist messages or inscriptions.

Afghan Army Gen. Abdul Jalil Rahimi, 
the commander of a military coordination office in the province, said he
and other officials met with protesters, tribal elders and clerics to 
try to calm their emotional response. ‘The protesters were very angry 
and didn’t want to end their protest...The people are very angry. The 
mood is very negative,’ he said.
