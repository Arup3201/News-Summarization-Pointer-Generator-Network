A young mother who was subjected to 'dead baby jokes' on Facebook after losing her unborn daughter has attacked the website for refusing to take down the offending page.

Jessamy O'Neill was asked by one internet 'troll' whether she dressed her dead baby up in a clown suit.

The 22-year-old made the heartbreaking decision to end her pregnancy after a scan showed her baby girl Sara had the rare chromosome disorder triploidy - and wouldn't have survived birth.

Disgusted: Jessamy O'Neill (pictured) was horrified by comments made about her dead baby on a Facebook page called Dead Baby Jokes after revealing that she had lost her daughter

Still grieving, Jessamy was horrified to discover the existence of a Facebook group called Dead Baby Jokes - and decided to write on the page's wall voicing her disgust.

She wrote: 'Me and my family had to go through the pain, hurt, & turmoil of burying mine & my partner's daughter & was the most painful thing we have ever done.

'I'm shaking so much through your nasty, evil, so-called jokes.'

Miss O'Neill, who lives with her grandmother in Swanscombe, Kent, was sickened by the response to her comment.

No infringement: Facebook said it would not be taking action against the group because dead baby jokes do not violate its Statement of Rights and Responsibilities

One comment asked if she dressed her dead baby up in a clown-suit.

Miss O'Neill, who is no longer with Sara's father, said: 'Reading these comments has made me shake with anger. I’ve been an absolute mess because of it, I can’t stop crying.

'I just can’t believe anybody would be so cruel and sick to write things like that - why does somebody want to hurt me like that?

'Losing Sara was absolutely awful. I don't think I will ever get over it, the pain is there every day.

'Me and my partner found out she had triploidy at the 20-week scan and my whole world just came crashing down.'

Miss O'Neill said she was disappointed 
that Facebook was refusing to shut down the page and was going to ask 
her local MP to lobby the website for her.

She said: 'I find it shocking that they don’t seem to care about the hurt these people have caused me.

'I'm going to write to my local MP and I am even prepared to go and sit outside David Cameron’s house and scream and shout until something is done about websites like this.'

A Facebook spokesman said: 'We take our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities very seriously and react quickly to remove reported content that violates our policies.

'In general, groups devoted to jokes, even disgusting and distasteful ones, do not violate our policies.

'Where these groups make real threats or statements of hate, however, we will remove them.

'We encourage people to report anything they feel violates our policies using the report links located throughout the site.

'Specifically, dead baby jokes groups and pages in general do not violate our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.

'However, should there be any specific images believed to display children at risk, we encourage the reporter to bring them to our attention so that we can investigate them and take action accordingly.'
