ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley has explained his pronunciation of Colombia talisman James Rodriguez’s first name after coming under fire on social media.

Rather than adopting the Spanish pronunciation ‘Ha-mez’ of the name that adorns the back of the 23-year-old’s shirt, Tyldesley instead used the English take on James during Colombia’s 2-0 victory over Uruguay on Saturday evening.

Writing in a guest blog for Kick It Out, Tyldesley justified his decision: ‘I am in the identification business, I am not a linguist. Believe it or believe it not, I do try to get pronunciations correct. And, yes, in his native Spanish language James Rodriguez becomes ‘Hamez Rod-reeg-ez’.

'The complications and dilemmas come when – like me – you are not a native Spanish speaker, or any other ‘speaker’ but plain English.

‘If some of the most famous of the household names at this World Cup were to be pronounced totally correctly, familiar players like van Persie, Ronaldo and Luiz would suddenly sound rather unfamiliar.

'So, at the risk of upsetting the multi-linguists, I admit that I do lean towards ‘Anglicising’ names for popular consumption. I believe it is far more important not to misuse words such as ‘tragedy’ and ‘disaster’ in football commentary.

‘But pronunciations will continue to divide and infuriate. I remember Ruud Gullit working with ITV as a World Cup panellist and saying that the guttural sound of his surname is simply not one that English speakers make.

'I have steered clear of trying to refer to Belo Horizonte as ‘Bello Horry-zontsscchhh’ because my clumsy attempt at speaking Portuguese would probably still be wrong, so why pretend?

‘So I will not be intentionally trying to wind anyone up when I shout ‘Jaimz Rod-reeg-ez’ on Friday. Quite the opposite.

'Personally, I think it would be a little perverse to refer to a man with ‘J-A-M-E-S’ on his back as anything other than ‘Jaimz’ on British television unless a different pronunciation of his name had been long established – particularly as he was happily scoring goals for Porto in Europe two years ago as ‘Jaimz Rod-reeg-ez’ on our channels.’

Tyldesley, who has been ITV’s lead commentator since the retirement of Brian Moore after the World Cup 1998, also vowed to continue with his Anglicised pronunciation in the upcoming games at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
