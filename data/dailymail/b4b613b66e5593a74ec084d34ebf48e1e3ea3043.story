Police have revealed they still have no suspects or leads in the case of a missing pregnant woman who mysteriously disappeared without trace more than a week ago.

Hawaiian woman Carly Scott was reported missing on February 10 by her mother and was last seen at her sister's home in Haiku on the island of Maui at 8pm the night before.

Family members said Scott, who is five months pregnant, left her sister's house to help her ex-boyfriend Steve Capobianco whose car had broken down on Hana Highway, near the eastern shore of the island.

Her abandoned and torched truck was found in a dirt track a few days later, along with some of her belongings, but there's still no trace of her.

No trace: Charli Scott, who is pregnant, was last seen on Sunday night

Officers have so far interviewed people who last had contact with the 27-year-old including her ex-boyfriend who apparently failed a lie detector test - but so far they have no suspects.

Speaking at a press conference, Capt. Jakubczak said the investigation continues to be classified as a missing person's case.

He said: 'We
 encourage the community, the public, to call with any information they 
have no matter how minute or how small they believe it is because we'll 
follow up on every lead or tip.'

Last
 Wednesday, Scott's SUV was found torched and was found abandoned on a dirt track. Jakubczak said a private 
search party found clothing and other items the following day that 
Scott's family identified as belonging to her. Police have the items and
 were processing them, he said.

Maui
 police were also looking for another missing woman, Moreira Monsalve, 
who was last seen in January. Jakubczak said there's no evidence the 
cases are connected, though they are similar. Monsalve, 46, was also 
last seen by her ex-boyfriend.

A team of 50 to 70 volunteers and family members have been searching for Scott since her mother reported her missing.

In an exclusive interview with Hawaii News Now last week Capobianco said: 'She picked me up from my house at 8:30pm, drove out to my truck that I got stuck in Keanae and she dropped me off at my truck -- it took me about 10 minutes to fix my truck, 'cause I had extra light tools with me at that time,'

'And then we came back to Haiku. And I'm pretty sure I saw her lights in my rear-view the entire time.'

Capobianco says he went home and went to bed and didn't check to see whether Scott until the following morning.

The following day Capobianco says he was awoken about 5:30am. by police knocking on his door.

They told him Scott's family had reported her missing and had given them his name. Capobianco admits he didn't have the greatest relationship with the family of his unborn baby's mother.

Capobianco says he went to the police station and was interrogated by detectives investigating Scott's disappearance. He also says he was given a lie detector test.

'The police told me I failed,' Capobianco said.

'They didn't make me take it again. I'm honestly not convinced I failed, I think they might have just said that as a tactic, but I really don't know - I'm walking around right now without handcuffs on.'

But Maui Mayor Alan Arakawa urged the public to allow investigators to do their job.

'Even
 though there's an urgency to try and solve these cases, one has to be 
very, very patient, those in our community have to be patient, to allow 
that process to evolve,' he said.

'Otherwise, we'll jeopardize the 
potential of being able to use whatever evidence is being found.'

Scott's
 mother, Kimberlyn Scott, told the Maui News that
 the family would be 'taking a breather' and wouldn't be actively 
searching Tuesday.

The team 
has been conducting daily searches from Haiku to Hana, by foot, on 
motorcycles and on all-terrain vehicles. They are armed with maps of the
 island and donated support including search dogs and a drone that took 
pictures and video of unreachable cliffs and ravines.

Red-head Scott, who goes by the nickname Charli, was born in Woodland, California, 
grew up in Sacramento and moved to Maui about 10 years ago.

Her father, Robert Scott, flew in from Seattle last week. More than a dozen relatives have flown in from the mainland.
