Crocodiles and alligators might be more creative than first thought when it comes to catching their dinner.

New research suggests the reptiles use tools, including collections of small sticks, to lure water birds to their death.

While this is clever, mugger crocodiles in India and crocodiles and alligators in Florida and Louisiana, seem to be aware of the seasons as they employed their techniques at the time of year when birds build nests and collect twigs.

Crocodiles are not the only animals to display baiting behaviour.

Green
 herons use feathers and twigs to attract fish when the hunt and 
burrowing owls have been known to use faeces to attract dung beetles to 
eat.

The University of Tokyo first noted that Green herons bait fish using feathers, twigs or even berries.

The study says: 'Bait fishing was used most frequently by the individual which fished often in open water with fewer suitable rocks, where the heron has to overcome the handicap of being easily seen by fish.'

Only a few species of birds use the technique to try and catch their dinner.

Zoologists from the University of Tennessee monitored the behaviour of crocodiles and alligators, which balance twigs on their snouts to attract birds, which probably think the sticks are floating on the water.

They saw this behaviour exhibited by replies living at rookeries in Louisiana and during the egret and heron nesting season, between the months of March and April, when the birds are trying to build their nests.

The zoologists systematically followed the behaviour of crocodiles at four sites in Louisiana for one year to come up with their findings.

The research is the first to detail tools used by any reptiles and the first known case of predators timing the use of lures to a seasonal behaviour of the prey.

The scientists said it is common for some bird species to choose to nest in trees growing in ponds and surrounded by crocodiles and alligators, as they use the reptiles as protection against tree-climbing nest predators, including snakes, monkeys and racoons.

However, the birds ‘pay’ for this protection as any chicks that fall into the water are usually snatched by the reptiles, as well as adults looking for nesting material who are seduced by the twigs balanced on stealthy crocodile noses.

In the study, published in the journal of Ethology Ecology and Evolution, the scientists, led by zoologist Vladimir Dinets who has authored a book about crocodile behaviour called DRAGON SONGS, note the behaviour has been spotted in two crocodile species, which raises the possibility that the behaviour is widely exhibited within the group.

They studied anecdotes and research about crocodiles at a rookery that was home to egrets near Chennai, India.

In 2007, when researchers were observing the behaviour of large mugger crocodiles, they repeatedly saw them with small twigs balanced on their noses.

On one occasion an egret moved to collect a stick and the crocodile lunged at it and later, similar activity was observed at large crocodile and alligator parks in Florida.

Two of the authors of the study, who have worked at St Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park in Florida for 13 years, which is home to 600 wading birds, said they had regularly observed alligators floating in the pond with sticks balanced across their snouts.

They said the stick baiting behaviour was only observed during the bird’s breeding and nest-building season from March to April, even though they were present at the rookeries until July.

‘Using objects as hunting lures is very rare in nature, having been observed in just a handful of species,’ according to the study.

‘At least one of them uses this method predominantly during the nest-building season of its prey.

'This is the first known case of a predator not just using objects as lures, but also taking into account the seasonality of prey behaviour.

‘It provides a surprising insight into previously unrecognised complexity of archosaurian behaviour.’

Crocodiles are not the only animals to display baiting behaviour, Scientific American reported.

Green herons use feathers and twigs to attract fish when the hunt and burrowing owls have been known to use faeces to attract dung beetles to eat.
