Two brothers have reportedly returned home to Ireland after escaping a notorious jail in Venezuela where they were serving an 11 year stretch for cocaine smuggling.

Leigh and Dermot O'Neill reportedly walked out of the front door of the San Juan de los Morros prison just outside Caracas in broad daylight.

According to an Irish priest who was contacted by the pair after their escape, the brothers left the prison with a Venezuelan inmate and stayed with his family before returning home.

Father John Jennings, who has spent 30 years in Caracas, told the Irish Sun: 'They went to a local bus terminal and the mother of the Venezeulan took the three of them to their house in the countryside.

'Most likely they would have handed over a lot of money.

'You don't just walk out the front door without help from the officials.'

Residents of the brothers' home town Athlone told the Belfast Telegraph that they have been seen with their sister in recent days.

One resident said: 'We don't know if they got out themselves or were let out to be honest, but they're home anyway, that's for sure.'

Leigh, 25, and Dermot, 21, were less than a year into their jail term when they escaped.

They were sentenced last year when fellow Irishman Martin Beirne, with whom they were travelling in the South American country, died in a Caracas hotel room when a cocaine-filled balloon urst in his stomach.

Although the pair initially fled, they were later arrested.

Leigh later passed 92 cocaine-filled balloons with a street value of 50,000 Euros. 

Although Leigh pleaded guilty to drug smuggling offences, his brother denied all charges and no drugs were found on him.

They had been inmates alongside drug traffickers and gang bosses at the prison which holds some 1,000 prisoners despite only having a capacity of 250.

Venezeulan jails are notoriously dangerous with as many of 400 inmates killed each year according to human rights groups.

Father Jennings said there has been no mention of the brothers' escape in the Venezuelan media.

An uncle of the pair, named only as Tommy in the Irish Sun, said that the family were 'over the moon' that they were out of prison.

They reportedly made their escape across the border to Columbia, eventually reaching Bogota before making their way back to Ireland.

Although the Venezuelan authorities did not confirm Leigh and Dermot's escape, according to the Irish Sun a prison source said that if they are asked of the O'Neill brothers' whereabouts they will claim they were killed and buried inside the prison grounds.

The brothers apparent escape comes as 20-year-old Michaela McCollum, from belfast, and 19-year-old Melissa Reid face jail in Peru on charges of alleged drug smuggling.

The two young women were arrested after allegedly trying to smuggle £1.5million of cocaine out of the country.

The pair claim that they were held at gunpoint and forced to smuggle the drugs, which were hidden in food packaging, out of the country.
