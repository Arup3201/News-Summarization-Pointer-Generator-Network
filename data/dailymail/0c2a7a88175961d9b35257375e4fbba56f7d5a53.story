These Alaskan brown bears were clearly not in the mood to share their dinner.

The pair got into a vicious fight over fishing rights in the river when one managed to catch a salmon, while the other was left empty handed.

But rather than try to catch its own food, the bear tried to steal the fish straight from its rival's jaws.

But the defending bear 
would not give its snack away quite so easily and the two began
to fight over the fresh water fish.

The confrontation was spotted in Katmai National Park, Alaska, by American photographer Tin Man Lee.

The 36-year-old said the battle was especially fierce as the two bears were of equal size.

The pair were pictured sizing each other up as they stood on their hind legs before the wrestling in the water and hitting each other with their giant paws.

Mr Lee said: 'The two bears seemed ready to fight ferociously for rights to the fish.

'When they fought it was a stunning scene, it didn't last very long but it felt like it lasted much longer.

'One thing I have learned about bear behaviour is that they only fight with similar sized bears, if there is a clear size difference, the smaller one always surrenders and flees the scene.

'This was an especially interesting moment as they were almost equal but inevitably one of the bears had to surrender and leave without a salmon.'

Alaska is home to all three species of American bear - the brown, black and polar bears.

The state contains about 98 per cent of the U.S. brown bear population with an estimated 30,000 individuals.
