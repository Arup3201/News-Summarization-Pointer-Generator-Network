Paintings said to be by gangster Reggie Kray that were set to go under the hammer have been withdrawn from auction after they were found to be fakes.

The three paintings, one entitled 'Girl Bathing' and two called 'Tree Studies', were thought to have been created by the notorious gangland boss in 1986 while he served a life sentence at Wayland Prison in Norwich and Parkhurst Jail on the Isle of Wight.

But Cambridge auctioneers Cheffins have removed the works from sale after experts deemed them too good to have been painted Kray.

Notorious: Gangster Reggie Kray was thought to have created the paintings in 1986 while serving life in prison

The watercolours, complete with Kray's prison number and signature, had been tipped to sell for at least £500 each.

Experts believed that 'Girl Bathing' was inspired by Edgar Degas's 'The Tub' which killer Kray is said to have become obsessed with during his incarceration.

But fellow inmate Peter Gillett told the Daily Mirror that Kray was too lazy to paint much.

The 54-year-old said: 'He was an egomaniac. If he had been that good he would have let everybody know.'

The paintings, which were due to be auctioned on May 2, had been described by Cheffins auctioneers as 'very different' and 'quite unusual'.

Sarah Flynn said that his works were 'not bad at all'.

But the auction house confirmed that the paintings were removed from sale after they were found to be forgeries.

Reggie Kray took up art after he was jailed for the murder of Jack 'The Hat' McVitie in 1969.

Both he and his brother Ronnie became keen artists while they were in jail, usually copying classic images by famous artists.

They were said to have produced scores of pictures in a variety of mediums including watercolour, chalk, charcoal, pastel, pencil, and on canvas - and cover a wide range of topics, including nudes, still life, and landscapes.

A series of artworks sold for more than £12,000 in 2009 and a 40-strong collection sold for more than £17,000 last summer.

Kray and his twin brother Ronnie became kingpins of organised crime in London during the 1950s and 1960s with their mob called 'The Firm'.

They were involved in armed robberies, arson, protection rackets and the murders of McVitie and George Cornell and both jailed for life in 1969.

Reggie was released from prison on compassionate grounds in 2000 and died eight weeks later from cancer aged 66. His brother died five years earlier age 61.
