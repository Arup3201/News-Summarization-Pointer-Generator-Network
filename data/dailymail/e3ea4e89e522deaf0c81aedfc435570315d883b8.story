International flight security concerns have been raised as passengers on board a flight from London to New York's JFK were left to bypass immigration when the plane arrived at the wrong terminal.

Passengers on the Delta Air Lines fight were let out into a section of the airport where they did not have to pass through immigration or customs.

They were only stopped when airport employees realised they were in the wrong part of the airport.

Passengers would usually be shuffled through the arriving immigrations and customs desks upon arrival to JFK, but on this flight they were allowed to bypass them

Plane crazy: The passengers were dropped off at a baggage claim terminal at JFK (stock picture of the airport), which could have allowed some with carry-on luggage to just stroll out of the airport

The passengers aboard the flight, Delta 3, which took off from Heathrow, found that instead of their expected customs and immigration check, they instead departed inside a domestic baggage claim.

CBS was alerted to the news by a passenger on the flight, Andrew Rostron, whose wife is a CBS News employee.

Rostron, 42, is originally from Bolton but now lives in New York, and was as flying back from UK after visiting his mum.

According to Rostron, the plane only had about 54 people aboard, and was by no means full.

Passengers on the Delta flight were eventually rounded up and put through immigration and customs, but not before they were let out at the baggage claim

Passengers were left next to the Delta baggage claim terminal of JFK upon arrival in the U.S.

Rostron said: ‘When we arrived at JFK we pulled up to the gate and the door opened, we got off and walk off the jet bridge.

'We didn’t really think about it but we were basically in the main part of the terminal where the passengers were preparing to board.

‘We kept walking past shops and duty free and restaurants and then we realised it was a bit strange.

'We just kept going. Terminal 4 at JFK is pretty big so you just go and go.

'The only place to go to eventually was domestic baggage, so we went to the baggage counter and we explained what happened and they just asked us “Why are you here?"

'It was just weird, very unusual.'

JFK Airport is the 17th busiest airport in the world and the 6th busiest in the U.S.

Rostron said: ‘I could have just left the airport and kept going, no question about it.

'I was practically out the front door of the airport but realised I have to go get my bag.

‘If you didn’t have checked luggage you could have just left, got in a cab and been gone. They had no idea.’

He said that eventually officials rounded them up, escorted them into main 
immigration arrivals hall and security officials took their name.

The entire processing of the passengers, from the gate to leaving the airport, reportedly took about just over an hour.

Delta Airlines told CBS News it is aware 
that 'a small number of customers off Delta flight 3 from London to New 
York's Kennedy International Airport were able to bypass customs 
screening.

They said: 'Delta is working with the Port Authority as well as Customs and Border Protection and is looking into the matter.

'Customer security is of vital importance and Delta makes every effort to follow appropriate procedures.'
