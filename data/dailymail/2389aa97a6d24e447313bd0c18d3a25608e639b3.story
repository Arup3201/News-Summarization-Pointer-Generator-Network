Shocked homeowners woke to find their well-to-do residential street had been littered with more than a hundred 'filthy' pornographic DVDs.

Around 100 copies of the 18-rated film, called Big Knockers, were dumped on the tree-lined road and spread along the verge and pavement.

Another batch of around 50 explicit DVDs, called Mucky's Dipstick, was also found lying in clear view around 500 yards away.

Shock: Graham Mann with the bag of porn DVDs, after the discs were left outside his home in Pinkneys Road, Maidenhead, Berkshire

Shocked residents quickly gathered up the discs in a bid to stop children from seeing them as they walked to a nearby school.

But many had already been shattered as early morning traffic drove over them, in Pinkneys Road, Maidenhead, Berkshire.

Information security expert Graham Mann, 58, said he was baffled as to why they were left outside the home he shares with wife Sue.

He said: 'My neighbour came over and told me a large number of 'dubious' DVDs called 'Big Knockers' had been left outside my house.

'They were all rated 18, so it was clear they were not going to contain photographs of door furniture.

'We scooped them all up and handed them over to the police but I think some passers-by had already taken a copy for their private collection.

'My wife put one of the discs into our DVD player and informs me it is a film about three women with rather large breasts.

'The other DVD, called Mucky's Dipstick, had a chap with his trousers down who was clearly ready to get it on with a young woman.

'Sue didn't get past the title screen on either disc and I haven't seen any of them.

'We are not easily shocked but I'm sure some people would find them quite filthy.

'It's a well-to-do, respectable area with elderly residents who would be appalled by the contents.'

Sue, 51, was worried they might be picked up by children as they walked past the house to school.

She said: 'We've had a bit of a giggle over it. It's kind of funny but serious at the same time.' The discs stopped traffic at times as drivers, who were oblivious to their nature, tried to avoid running them over.

Sue said she did not recognise the three ladies in the footage.

It is presumed the other Big Knockers discs feature the same content although they have not all been viewed.

It is not known where the discs came from or why they were dropped on the street.

Thames Valley Police spokesman Chris Kearney said: 'They are not the sort of discs we want lying around on the street.

'We collected them from the road where they were dumped but nobody has come forward to claim them so they will be destroyed.

'There is no suggestion at this time that they were stolen or that any crime has been committed.'
