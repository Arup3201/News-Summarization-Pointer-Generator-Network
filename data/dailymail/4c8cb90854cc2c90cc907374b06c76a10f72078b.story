A 19-year-old Sydney siege survivor has pleaded guilty to aggravated break and enter charges in a courtroom on Friday.

Lindt café worker Jarrod Morton-Hoffman was praised for his bravery and leadership qualities during the 17 hour ordeal in Martin Place on December 15. 

But on Friday, the teenager faced the Sydney District Court for a robbery offence he committed about six months before the traumatic event with two friends, Nine News reports. 

Mr Morton-Hoffman is alleged to have stolen $1000 worth of American Apparel clothing from one of the chain's stores in the Sydney CBD, according to News Corp.

The case has been adjourned to a later date.

Earlier this month the teenager told 60 Minutes how he and co-worked Joel Herat had secretly armed themselves with kitchen knives, hoping for a moment to be able to attack gunman Man Haron Monis.

'I've got this knife in my pocket and I know Joel has a knife in his pocket,' Mr Morton-Hoffman said.

But the duo quickly decided against an attack, in fear that it could lead to fatal consequences for pregnant lawyer Julie Taylor.

'We are so close we could do this but you know someone would need to jump, hold his arms down and then I would stab him in the jugular,' he said.

'But he had his gun, he had it on his knee and I could see that it was pointed directly at Julie Taylor's back.' 

Despite being aware of endless opportunities to escape, the 19-year-old also revealed he refused to budge until the very end, disturbed by the threats made by Monis.

'If someone else leaves, someone dies,' he recalled the gunman saying.

'I saw April was standing up and she was pulling the deadbolt up on the side door. Everyone's looking at me because they know that the side door is open.'

Mr Morton-Hoffman, who is understood to have stolen $1000 worth of clothing from an American Apparel store, has had his case adjourned to a later date

Instead, he led the last group of hostages to escape the café.

'I thought that Tori was right behind me. I saw Joel but I thought I saw Tori. I thought that it was Tori as well. And I just thought we were all going to be okay. And I thought, I thought wrong,' he said.

'I got most out. But just not enough.'
