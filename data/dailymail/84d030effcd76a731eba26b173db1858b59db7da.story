JetBlue have been fiercely criticised after Tweeting an ill-advised pun referencing the Hindenburg disaster.

To its 1.9 million followers on Twitter, the no-frills US airline wrote 'Oh, the Bluemanity' as it showed of the designs on its aircraft tail.

The phrase was a take on when radio announcer Herbert Morrison exclaimed 'Oh, the humanity!' in 1937 when he reported on the terrible disaster that left 36 people dead.

Although the ill-advised Tweet was removed within minutes, people had already re-Tweeted the item

JetBlue have come in for fierce criticism after referencing the Hindenburg disaster on Twitter

Almost immediately after the poorly thought-out Tweet went live, users rounded on the company expressing their shock at the reference.

Twitter user Joey White was quick to point out that while JetBlue were quick to delete, the internet 'never forgets' while most described the Tweet as 'the ultimate faux pas.' 

The Tweet was deleted before 10 minutes had passed, but the seed had been sown.

JetBlue spokesman Morgan Johnston told the Daily News: 'We recognized it was an error. It was not well thought out, and we removed it.'

The company then proceeded to reply back to users who had seriously questioned the logic of posting such a message.

A total of 36 people died when the Hindenburg airship burst into flames in New Jersey, US

Replying to a shocked Jake Hamilton, JetBlue wrote: 'We got caught up in our own cleverness and didn't think it all the way through.' 

The Hindenburg disaster took place on May 6, 1937, as the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey, US.

Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), there were 35 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen). One worker on the ground was also killed, making a total of 36 dead.

The disaster was the subject of spectacular newsreel coverage, photographs, and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day.

The accident, at the time, was considered to be the worst in commercial aviation history.

MailOnline Travel have contacted JetBlue and are awaiting comment.
