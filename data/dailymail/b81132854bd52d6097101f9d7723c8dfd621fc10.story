Two more soldiers should be court-martialled over hazing that led to the suicide of American soldier Danny Chen, military investigators have recommended.

Daniel Schwartz, a 25-year-old first 
lieutenant from Maryland and Travis F. Carden,a 25-year-old sergeant 
from Fowler, Indiana are among eight soldiers charged in the death of 
19-year-old Danny Chen.

The infantryman from New York City shot himself in a guard tower in southern Afghanistan in October last year after what after what investigators say were weeks of physical abuse, humiliation and racial slurs.

Death: Private Danny Chen, 19, of New York, was found dead in a guard tower at Combat Outpost Palace on October 3 after apparently committing suicide

A native New Yorker of Chinese descent, 
Mr Chen had been in Afghanistan only two months when he shot himself in a
guardhouse at a remote outpost in Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

Mr Chen's relatives say he was 
brutally hazed during training because he was Chinese-American. They 
have said investigators told them that he was subjected to numerous 
racial slurs and forced to do excessive sit-ups, push-ups, runs and 
sprints carrying sandbags as punishment for not being as physically fit 
as the rest of the platoon.

On the day that he eventually ended 
his life, he had forgotten his helmet and his water when he went to 
report to the guardhouse. His superiors forced him to crawl over 100 
meters of gravel with all of his equipment when he returned, all the 
while having other soldiers throw rocks at him.

The two soldiers were recommended for 
courts-martial following a pretrial hearing at Kandahar Air Field on 
Sunday.

They each face various criminal charges in his death.

Schwartz, joined the Army in 2009 and
was assigned to Chen’s unit in July 2010 for his first deployment. has a
previous record having been  arrested five years ago for possession of a
controlled substance, according to records.

Last month investigators  recommended
that specialist Ryan Offutt, 32, be court-martialed on charges 
including assault, negligent homicide, and reckless endangerment, though
they declined to pursue more serious manslaughter charges against the 
32-year-old.

Offutt is thought to have been among 
the worst bullies and has a previous conviction for simple assault and indecent assault 
having beaten up his former girlfriend, who colleagues said they found naked and bleeding in the face.

The most serious charge Offutt now faces is negligent homicide, which carries a prison sentence of up to three years.

Remembered: Danny Chen is pictured with his family in an emotional video which features his friends and relatives asking: 'What happened to Danny?'

Anger: The Organisation of Chinese Americans Elizabeth OuYang speaks in New York while Private Chen's parents, Yan Tao Chen, left, and Su Zhen Chen, right, listen

State Senator Daniel Squadron, who 
represents the New York neighbourhood where Chen grew up, spoke about the
teen on the state Senate floor on Tuesday.

Squadron said.'The tragedy that 
befell him, the experience that he had serving our country, is one that 
no person in this country should ever have, period,'

'What those who hazed Danny Chen did 
is they disrespected every one of their brothers and sisters in the 
armed forces,' he added.

Criminal: Specialist Ryan Offutt punched and choked his ex-girlfriend, stripping her, in a sadistic beating in 2001
