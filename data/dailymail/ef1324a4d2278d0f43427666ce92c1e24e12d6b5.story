Manchester United are hoping to secure a working visa for Radamel Falcao at the British Consulate in Miami.

The 28-year-old is in America with Colombia ahead of their friendly against Brazil on Friday and United want to use that time to start the process of gaining clearance for the striker so that he is available to face QPR on September 14. 

Obtaining a work permit for Falcao should not be a problem but United's new No 9 must still have an interview before a visa is issued.

Waiting game: United have not secured a working visa for new signing Marcos Rojo

Falcao signed for United in a £20million loan deal that was only ratified by the Premier League at 1.10am on Tuesday.

United completed Falcao's medical and submitted the deal sheet to the Premier League by the 11.45pm deadline on Monday and were then granted an extra hour to complete the move after the striker's late arrival in England from France.  

United are also still waiting for £16m Argentina defender Marcos Rojo to be granted a visa - two weeks after he signed for the club from Sporting Lisbon.
