Police in Italy have captured a secret initiation ritual by Italy’s most feared and powerful mafia on camera for the first time.

In a scene seemingly straight out of the Godfather films, the ‘men of honour’ met at an old farmhouse near Lake Como to swear an oath of allegiance to a secret society within the mafia known as the ‘Santa’ .

In a separate ceremony recorded by police, the alleged mafiosi took oaths in the presence of a revolver and cyanide capsules to symbolise the penalty for betraying the clan.

Police in Italy have captured a secret initiation ritual by Italy’s most feared and powerful mafia on camera for the first time near an old farmhouse near Lake Como

Police captured the footage during an investigation into three mafia clans based north of Milan which led to 38 arrests; the footage was released during a press conference today

The rituals were captured as part of an investigation which led to 38 arrests in the north of Italy this morning.

Three mafia clans based north of Milan, in the provinces of Como and Lecco in the Lombardy region were being investigated. 

The Ndrangheta, originally from the Calabria, the ‘toe’ of Italy, have spread their tentacles into the north of Italy and into neighbouring countries forming links with the Colombian cartels and the IRA among others. They supply an estimated 80 per cent of Europe's cocaine.

Details of the recorded meeting were revealed on Tuesday by Italian police who released part of the footage.

In the quasi-religious ceremony, which also borrows from freemasonry traditions, those present organised their hierarchy and allotted roles to each other.

Sitting round a table with heads bowed, the group ‘baptised’ their surroundings. Then the footage shows the boss asking them to agree 'a sacred bond'.

For the first time officers witnessed the conferral of a role onto an underage minor, the 16-year-old nephew of one of the other gang members; during the ceremony members repeated 'a secret bond'  

He is heard saying: 'This sacred evening and under the light and splendour of the stars and the moon we form a sacred bond.'

The gangsters repeat after him:' We pledge to deny everything until the seventh generation, to renounce all the criminal societies recognised by me until today, so as to preserve the honour of my wise brothers.'

The bond is made in the names of Garibaldi and Mazzini, heroes of the Italian unification who were said to be cited in freemasonry and are thought to refer to nicknames of the group.

For the first time officers witnessed the conferral of a role onto an underage minor, the 16-year-old nephew of one of the other gang members.

Those arrested by a special police unit were being held on suspicion of belonging to the mafia and extortion, as well as carrying unlicensed guns.
