West Ham have signed Hamilton defender Stephen Hendrie on after the clubs agreed a £1million compensation package.

The Scotland U21 international left-back will join in the summer after signing a pre-contract agreement with the Hammers.

Hamilton claimed that Reading and Bournemouth were also interested in the former Accies youth player, who was due to be out of contract in the summer.

The move looked to be off last week when Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie McDonald criticised West Ham, however, David Sullivan has smoothed over negotiations.

'I'm absolutely buzzing,' Hendrie confirmed. 'The last few days have been busy, but now that I'm down here and I've signed, I cannot wait to start in the summer.

'I'm thrilled to bits. I can't believe that it's happened. West Ham is such a massive club with a massive fan base and I just cannot wait to get started. I'm looking forward to it.

'I think the Premier League's the best league in the world and you want to play at the highest level you possibly can. Since I was a kid I always wanted to play in the Premier League and I've got a fantastic chance to do that now.'

'I know that the atmosphere is electric at the Boleyn Ground. The fans are brilliant and we've moving to a bigger stadium and it'll be even better, so I'm looking forward to that too.'

'They're big names and everybody knows West Ham up there because of those boys,' he confirmed. 

'They did extremely well here and everybody knows West Ham because of them and because of how big a club they are. The fan base is brilliant and so is everything else that goes with it.'

The young defender is the latest Hamilton youth product to move south of the border in recent seasons, following the likes of Everton midfielder James McCarthy and Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur.
