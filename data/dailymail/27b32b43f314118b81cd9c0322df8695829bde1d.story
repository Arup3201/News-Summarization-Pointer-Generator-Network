A 23-year-old man has died after collapsing during today's Brighton marathon.

Medics and an off-duty police officer tried to revive the runner, from London, before he was taken to hospital, but he was later declared dead.

He is thought to have had a cardiac arrest around the 16-mile mark of the course.

Tragedy: More than 9,000 people competed in today's Brighton marathon, where a runner died

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'A 23-year-old man has sadly died after suffering a medical episode whilst competing in the Brighton marathon this morning.

'Emergency services were called to Grand Avenue in Hove at around 11.45am where it is believed the London man suffered a cardiac arrest.

'He was treated at the scene by medical staff, including doctors and paramedics, along with an off-duty police officer, before being taken by ambulance to hospital, where he underwent surgery but sadly he couldn't be saved and died a short time later.'

The man's family has been informed of his death.

A spokesman for organisers of the marathon said: 'It is with regret that we can confirm that a competitor collapsed and later died competing in the Brighton Marathon this morning.

'Our emergency plans were put in place and he was treated at the scene by senior doctors, nurses and paramedics before being taken by ambulance to hospital.

'Despite receiving immediate attention, the runner was later declared dead at the Royal Sussex County Hospital.'

Race: The marathon on the south coast was started by England cricketer Matt Prior

He added: 'We at Grounded Events, the organisers of the Brighton Marathon, would like to express our sincere condolences to family and friends of the deceased.'

This year's race was started by England cricketer Matt Prior and attracted more than 9,000 participants.

The runner's death follows last year's London Marathon when hairdresser Claire Squires, 30, had a heart attack close the finish line and died.

She had aim to raise £5,000 for Samaritans and after her death more than £1million was donated via her JustGiving page.

More than 9,000 participants took part in the marathon which was started by England cricketer Matt Prior.

Hairdresser Claire Squires, 30, had a heart attack less than a mile from the finish line of the London Marathon last year.
