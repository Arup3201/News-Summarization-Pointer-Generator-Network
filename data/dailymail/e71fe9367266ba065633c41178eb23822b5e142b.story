A former face model has 
spoken out against the ever-growing trend for Botox and injectable 
fillers, claiming that 'people are starting to look like aliens'.

California-based
 Machel Shull, 42, who fronted campaigns for beauty brands including St 
Ives during her twenties, says it's the equivalent of 'injecting poison'
 into the face and 'changes a person's ability to empathize with 
others.'

In her book 
Middle Age Beauty she reveals that she has never had any cosmetic work 
done and stays looking youthful by using a combination of soap, water 
and Vaseline around her crow's feet.

She also likes to drink apple cider vinegar and take melatonin supplements every night 'without fail.'

The married mother-of-one told MailOnline: 'Some think that sounds crazy, but it 
works for me and I know many women use it from doing research online 
but it’s not something you run around and brag about.

'Before Botox, ask yourself "What other methods can I use before filling my only face with a poison?"'

'It doesn’t sound quite as glamorous as Botox.'

She says that many of her middle-aged friends are drawn to cosmetic procedures in a bid to iron out their wrinkles.

The most popular choices on the menu are Botox, lip injections and, to reverse the effects of gravity, breast enhancements. 

Ms Shull says that she tries to stay out of discussions about cosmetic surgery and 'stays neutral' on the subject.

But in her book, which was 
released this month and comes almost two decades after the meteoric rise
 of Botox as facial 'quick fix', she voices her true opinions.

'Before Botox, ask yourself,' she writes. 'What other methods can I use before filling my 
only face with a poison? . . . Remember there is only one you in this world.

'Embrace your natural beauty. Find other ways to keep wrinkles away that don’t require injecting a needle into your face.'

Her tome is packed full of non-invasive beauty tips such as practicing meditation and limiting alcohol intake.

'I know people in their 20s who are thinking about Botox,' says Ms Shull, who has a teenage daughter.

'Embrace your natural beauty. Find other ways to keep wrinkles away that don’t require injecting a needle into your face'

'There are some girls doing it who don’t even have wrinkles yet. And these companies are just trying to sell products!'

Ms
 Shull warns to younger readers that the effects of regular Botox 
injections look bizarre and don’t bode well in the long-term.

'Some
 of those chicks on the reality shows, they’re going in every month. 
Those people are starting to look like aliens,' she says.

'And
 they find that eventually the face muscles will atrophy. It freezes the
 muscles, and eventually, if you overdo it, the muscle will fall forward
 in the face. It will sag.'

Widespread trend: According to the International Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Botox came out on top as the most popular cosmetic procedure in 2012, with over three million injections administered worldwide

And Ms Shull isn't alone in her views.
 Actress Julia Roberts, 46, has shunned Botox, saying, 'I want my kids to
 know when I’m happy and when I’m confounded.'

And fellow thespian Rachel
 Weisz, 43,  has gone so far as to propose that the treatment be outlawed from
 her profession: 'It should be banned for actors, as steroids are for 
sportsmen. Acting is all about expression - why would you want to iron out a frown?

‘People who look too perfect don’t look sexy or particularly beautiful.’

Kate Winslet echoed her sentiment, saying, 'I am an actress; I don’t want to freeze the expression of my face.'

Some of the more openly devoted scalpel and syringe lovers reportedly include Demi Moore, 51, and Nicole Kidman, 46.

MayoClinic
 lists possible, common side effects of facial-injected Botox as 
'swelling or bruising at the injection site and headache or flu-like 
symptoms.'

More serious
 complications include 'eyelid drooping, muscle weakness all over the 
body, vision problems, trouble speaking or swallowing, trouble breathing
 and loss of bladder control.'

According
 to the International Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons Botox came 
out on top as the most popular cosmetic procedure in 2012, with over 
three million injections administered worldwide.

Ms
 Shull concludes: 'When I researched synthetic fillers, I feel so 
grateful I always trusted my instincts and stayed away from any face 
injections.

'I will be 
43 in February! Celebrate each birthday! Be happy to live one more year.
 Don’t be afraid of a wrinkle. Be afraid of being six feet under!'
