This is the week the dynamic of Liverpool’s season changes. And just when things are moving in the right direction for Brendan Rodgers.

Two defeats in 22 games have seen the Anfield side move to within four points of the Champions League places and secure an FA Cup quarter-final slot after Saturday’s win at Selhurst Park.

But how will the Merseysiders deal with the Europa League restarting this week?

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has warned his players about the Europa League curse

It’s that Thursday-Sunday conundrum to which nobody seems to have the answer. Liverpool welcome Besiktas this Thursday before travelling to fellow Barclays Premier League top-four contenders Southampton on Sunday.

Four days later they face the return leg in Turkey, before welcoming champions Manchester City on Sunday.

So, is the Europa League a hindrance for Rodgers? ‘We want to play as many games as we can,’ said the Liverpool manager.

‘It will be tough but when you’re winning games it gives you energy. We had tough games this week but the players have been brilliant and came through it well.

‘Now we’ll recover and look forward to the Europa League because it’s a competition, like the FA Cup, we want to do well in.’ 

However, Rodgers is under no illusion that the competition will have an impact on the rest of Liverpool’s campaign.

‘There is no doubt that you’re always playing catch-up. It can be tough. But it’s a European competition, so it’s a very prestigious tournament. And a Champions League place for the winner makes it more attractive but there is still a way to go before you can think of that.

The FA Cup sixth-round draw will be made at 7.35pm on Monday, before kick-off in Preston's fifth-round tie with Man Utd.

1. Liverpool (Odds: 5/2)

2. Arsenal (13/8)

3. Aston Villa (16/1)

4. West Brom (10/1)

5. Bradford (66/1)

6. Blackburn (28/1)

7. Reading (33/1)

8. Preston (150/1) or Man Utd (3/1)

‘Certainly we’re very focused on doing well in it. The players are young and hungry and this is a group who can grow over the next couple of years. 

'But we would like to get a trophy to signify that growth so the Europa League is a competition we will take seriously.’

Saturday’s win at Palace brought to an end Liverpool’s recent Selhurst Park hoodoo. 

When Palace took the lead through Fraizer Campbell, it looked as if Alan Pardew’s side would maintain their hold over Rodgers’ team. 

However, Liverpool hit back with two goals in nine minutes through Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana.

So Pardew’s sole focus now is to ensure Palace retain their Premier League status, with the manager saying the appointments of Chris Ramsey at QPR and Tim Sherwood at Aston Villa will change the dynamic of the relegation battle. 

‘A new manager is going to have an impact at some stage,’ said Pardew. ‘Players have got a new challenge, a new start to a degree. Those managers will be using those factors.

'Of course now it is going to be a really tough race. The prize is getting bigger and bigger each year and the pressure on the managers gets bigger and bigger.’

On the appointment of Ramsey at Loftus Road, Pardew added: ‘I am very, very pleased that we have a black manager in the Premier League. It has been a long time coming and I am really pleased for him and for the Premier League.’

Palace find out on Monday if they face a second investigation in a week over missiles thrown by their fans after an incident following Sturridge’s equaliser. A coin hit Newcastle’s Fabricio Coloccini during the draw at Selhurst Park on Wednesday.
