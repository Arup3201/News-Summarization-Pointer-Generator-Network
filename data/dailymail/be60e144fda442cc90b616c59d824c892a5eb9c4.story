A couple are horrified after finding a dead shrew at the bottom of a crisp packet destined for their son's lunchbox.

Jonathan and Elinor Hughes found the rodent after eating their way through a large pack of lightly-salted Kettle Chips that had been delivered to their home in the Conwy Valley, Wales.

Mr Hughes, 34, said: 'We bought some lightly-salted flavoured Kettle Chips and they were delivered with our Sainsbury’s shopping to our house.

According to Kettle Foods's investigations, the shrew had not been in the packet for long before it was found

'We started to eat the crisps and ate the first half of the bag. Elinor was going to split the rest of them for a packed lunch. But we were absolutely horrified to find a mouse in the bottom.

'We’d been going to put the crisps with my nine-year-old son Finlay’s lunch'

Jonathan Hughes had already eaten half of the packet, with his wife Elinor, before they found the dead rodent

Mr Hughes immediately rang Kettle Foods UK and said the company asked him to send a photograph and also to put the 'foreign body' in an envelope and post it to them.

However, within moments of the photograph being sent, the company rang to say a courier would collect the mouse.

A spokeswoman for Kettle Foods Ltd said: 'We take food safety and quality very seriously and have stringent systems and procedures in place to ensure that every bag of KETTLE® Chips reaches our consumers in perfect condition.

'We have been consulting with Mrs Hughes since this issue came to light yesterday. We received the pack last night and have today sought independent advice from an expert Pest Control Company.

'From this we have ascertained that the dead animal is a shrew, and due to its appearance in the bag it would seem to have been dead for a relatively short period of time.

'Our investigations so far indicate that the shrew did not enter the bag at Kettle Foods, or during distribution, and therefore we need to understand how it came to be associated with our product.

'Naturally we are taking this issue seriously and will be undertaking further work to ascertain how this situation came about.

'We fully understand the anxiety that this has caused to Mr and Mrs Hughes and we will continue to liaise directly with them.'

Sainsbury’s have been approached for comment.
