The sound of parents screaming from the touchline has long been a part of children’s football.

But last weekend, the din gave way to deafening silence for a campaign against intimidation.

It was the first brave new step in a bid 
to stamp out touchline hostility and intimidation that has plagued 
junior football for years and led many to walk away from the game.

The Silent Weekend, planned by Lancashire Football Association, saw 1,000 games played in almost total quiet.

‘It was an incredible thing,’ said Neil 
Yates, Lancashire County FA welfare officer, whose idea it was.

‘Gone 
were the sounds of adults screaming and shouting their advice from the 
touchline, like a bunch of baying sea lions. It was so refreshing.

‘Instead
 the children were able to play the game without the touchline shouting 
and pressure that has, frankly, become part of the junior game.’

The initiative aims to change the rowdy 
environment of junior football matches so children have the ability to 
learn the sport more naturally.

It aims to stamp out the bullying 
advice they often receive where one parent is screaming for them pass 
the ball while another is calling for them to shoot.

Some 2,000 teams from 200 clubs signed up.

Josh Lennon, whose 11-year-old son plays 
for a team that took part said: ‘Some matches were absolutely ridiculous
 – the crowd was more like a baying mob and it can be a really 
intimidating thing to put your children through.

‘There was a lot of bullying form the touchline with parents scoffing at children and telling them how they should be playing.

Refreshing: Neil Yates, Lancashire County FA welfare officer, came up with the idea after he watched an under-nines match last year and saw how terrified one boy was. He said: 'Gone were the sounds of adults screaming and shouting their advice from the touchline, like a bunch of baying sea lions. It was so refreshing'

‘I think the Silent Weekend was an excellent idea and not
 before time.’

Mr Yates came up with the idea after he watched an under-nines match last year and saw how terrified one boy was. 

He
 said: ‘He was absolutely petrified by the experience. All the adults 
were shouting and baying and it was an intimidating and hostile 
environment.

'Afterwards his father came over and 
said: "This is not right. Something has to change."

‘I agreed with 
him and immediately set about thinking how we could make the environment
 less hostile for people just learning the sport.'

Coaches also had to be quiet, although there were concerns about how they would instruct players as a result. It is now hoped that other FA bodies could take up the idea.

But it wasn’t only the crowd that was asked to remain quiet during Silent Weekend, even the coaches had to button their lips.

Mr Yates said: ‘There was some opposition to that and after the matches there were some concerns that coaches weren’t able to coach the players and there were some parents who were frustrated by not being able to offer their encouragement.

‘But the aim of the weekend was to show how junior football matches can be marred by the type of hostility and intimidation that have become a norm.’
