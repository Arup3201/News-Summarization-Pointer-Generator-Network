The Australian parents of an unborn child with two faces and two brains are defying doctors' advice to terminate the pregnancy.

Renee Young and Simon Howie, of Tregear in Sydney's west, say they were shocked when an ultrasound revealed the twins they were expecting were in fact only one child, but with two perfectly symmetrical faces and two brains connected to the one brain stem.

Three-dimensional scans show the child has two legs, two arms and one body and all its vital organs, including a strong beating heart.

But while doctors told Ms Young she should not keep the child 'because it would be looked upon by the public as a freak', the couple has decided to go through with the birth and 'surround' the child 'with people who love it'.

After getting over the shock of expecting a baby which has two faces and two brains, but a single body, parents of seven, Renee Young and Simon Howie are defying doctor's advice by going through with the birth of the child which they say they shall love even though it will be 'ridiculed'

The baby, show here in an ultrasound image of the foetus in utero, is an extreme version of conjoined twin girls which have two faces and two brains joined by a single brain stem, but one body with a single heart

Three-dimensional scans show the child has two legs, two arms and one body, but above the neck (as seen on the model, left) the child has two faces on one double-vaulted skull, an exact duplication of eyes, nose and mouth, and two brains (pictured above right on medical imaging) connected to one brain stem

Above the neck, the child has one double-vaulted skull and two faces with an exact duplication of eyes, nose and mouth.

Ms Young described her unborn child, now 19 weeks old, as 'healthy. The heartbeat's beautiful'.

'The brain activity 's good,' she told the Nine Network's A Current Affair, 'in both brains.'

The condition, an extreme form of conjoined twins known as craniofacial hyperhidrosis or diprosopus, is so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded. None has survived.

Despite the medical unlikelihood of the baby surviving past infancy, the couple has decided to surround her with 'the love' of their large family.

The couple, who live on welfare in a public housing block in the Sydney suburb of Tregear, said their strong 'family base'  meant they could protect the child, no matter her deformities.

Surrounded by seven children who range in age from teenagers down to the youngest, who is in a high chair, Mr Howie said they had refused to end the pregnancy on 'moral' grounds.

'We thought it was the same as bringing home a child with autism or Down syndrome,' he said, 'I don't really believe in terminating a baby if it's healthy and growing fine.'

It was early January when the couple made the discovery of their baby's condition during a routine ultrasound which was anything but.

During a scheduled appointment, the sonographer told Ms Young 'something was up' and sent her to the couple's GP, who broke the news.

The doctor told the couple their baby had 'a conjoinment of the vaults of the skull, which pretty much said there was a conjoined twin,' Mr Howie said.

Initially, he was 'shocked, confused, a little bit of everything … I wasn't sure how to take in what he was explaining to me," Mr Howie told A Current Affair.

Ms Young was too far along in her pregnancy to abort the child.

Further tests were made and and a meeting with their obstetrician the couple saw images of their baby's duplication, which occurs only in four per cent of conjoined twins.

But the specialist's advice to end the baby's life was met with the couple's firm resolve to 'go through with it'.

'Everything happens for a reason,' Ms Young said.

They said they had defied the doctors' urging them not to bring into the world a child that would be regarded as a freak partly because Ms Young had never terminated a pregnancy and because they had a family 'that gives us a lot of support'.

'We've got a really big family, we don't really involve ourselves in the community except for schools where the children are,' Mr Howie said.

Maternal foetal specialist Greg Kesby has seen several conjoined twins in his career but none quite like this.

Shock and disbelief gave way to acceptance by expectant Renee Young and Simon Howie of Sydney who say 'it will be hard for the community to accept' their next child 'as a normal person' but they felt a moral obligation not to terminate the baby

Renee Young did not know anything was wrong until 15 weeks into her pregnancy when a routine ultrasound (above) showed she was carrying a rare form of conjoined twins called diprosopus, of which only 35 cases have been recorded, and none survived

Conjoining of twins happens between days 13 and 25 of pregnancy when the embryo fails (above) to split into two separate babies and fusion occurs

'It's probably the rarest of all the conjoined twins, you'd be thinking numbers of one in a million to one in two million for this kind of anomaly,' he said.

Dr Kesby said there was a good chance the couple's child would not survive to a live birth but if she did, treatment could prove costly.

But the burgeoning family said they would 'cross that bridge as it comes'.

'If we have to go back to work, we will,' said Ms Young who is on a disability pension for her severe rheumatoid arthritis and is looked after by Mr Howie, who draws a carer's pension.

The couple's three teenage daughters, Jess, Patsy-Anne and Angel said they did not believe their mother should terminate the pregnancy.

'We'll love it no matter what,' Jess said.

'It might be deformative, but it's still a baby. It's still a human,' said Patsy-Anne.

The last known case of diprosopus was the birth of baby girl Lali in 2008 in a remote Indian village.

She struggled to feed properly due to her condition and two months to the day she was born, she died.

'If I only get two days with the baby, I only get two days,' Ms Young said.

'That's just the time we actually get to spend with the baby and its brothers and sisters get to meet their little brother or sister.'
