Andy Murray got an early season reminder that even players ranked below 300 can be a handful, and that playing Grand Slams is different to playing unofficial exhibition events.

Faced with the pressure of the year's first Major and an underrated opponent in Yuki Bhambri, the world No 6 had life made awkward for him by the unfacied Indian before coming through 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 in two hours and 13 minutes at the Australian Open.

The 27 year-old Scot now faces Australia's Marinko Matosevic, who won his first match in five attempts at Melbourne Park by overcoming Russian Alexander Kurdyatsev in five sets.

Murray, who had swept all before him at non-ranking events in Abu Dhabi and Perth prior to this, struggled to contain his frustration against Bhambri, who had nothing to lose after coming through the qualifying event.

The Indian was the lowest ranked player in the draw at 317 but his probing groundstrokes often had Murray frantically retrieving, not to mention chuntering away at himself, shaking his head and cursing. At times it looked as if he had been expecting an easier ride.

However, he made clear that was not the case afterwards, saying, 'He made it very difficult for me, he played very aggressively and made it tough. I had never seen him play before or hit with him and that made it more tricky. He shouldn't be ranked where he is.

Murray looked comfortable on his serve and did well to win in straight sets 

'I have got a tough draw this year and it's going to be quite a challenge.'

The invective directed at Amelie Mauresmo and his player box does not bode well, although he looked fairly sharp a lot of the time, despite having to fight back from being a break down in the third set.

He won the subsequent tiebreak 7-3 and overall served and returned with purpose against someone who showed the strength in depth of the men's game.

Bhambri played far better than his world ranking of 317 suggested

On the plus side, and if one is looking at what he and Mauresmo have been working on during the off season, there seems to be a more deliberate ball toss on his serve and he moved particularly well wide to his forehand side.

Murray was given the small honour of playing the first match ever on the revamped Margaret Court Arena, which now seats 7,500 and has been added to by what is proudly termed as the fastest closing roof in Australia.

However it was never likely to be able to show off that capability as it was bright day one of the Australian Open, albeit far removed from the scorching temperatures that marked the opening week twelve months ago.

He will have been pleased to get off in straight sets and emerge from a match that presented him with everything to lose. There is no substitute for playing matches in the biggest events when the pressure is at its most intense.
