Amazon has been accused of ‘extortion’ by raising fees by up to 70 per cent for companies that sell through its website.

The online retailer is to increase the commission on all electronic goods sold on its ‘marketplace’ section from 7.5 per cent to 12 per cent from Thursday.

But small business owners say the move erodes profit margins and could send many to the wall.‘It makes it very difficult to make money,’ said one retailer. ‘Once you tot it all up, you’re not actually making a profit.’

Dominance: The world's biggest internet retailer is imposing punishing fee increases on small traders who sell their goods through the website

About 40 per cent of Amazon’s business comes from its marketplace, where other companies can sell their wares.

The US group already charges firms 15
 per cent for homeware items, but traders warned that electronic goods 
have razor-thin profit margins.

Any business selling more than 35 
items a month now faces fees of £28.75. On rival website eBay, however, 
sellers can list up to 50 items a month free and pay a flat 10 per cent 
when an item is sold.

Amazon’s changes, which affect the UK
 and parts of Europe, also raise the commission on vehicle parts by 
three per cent to 15 per cent.

Some business owners now face the 
choice between raising prices or watching their profits vanish 
altogether.

‘All Amazon is doing for the money is taking credit card 
details from the customer,’ said one businessman.

‘All that’s going to happen on the 
marketplace is that sellers will have to put their price up, but then 
they will get undercut.’

He said 60 per cent of the 
£2.5million revenues from his homeware operation last year came from the
 American company – which made it difficult to go elsewhere.

But many traders may still abandon Amazon for eBay or Play.com despite the reliance on its online dominance, he added.

Another trader said Amazon could see what products prove most popular on the marketplace before selling them itself.

‘They end up competing with their own
 customers,’ he added. ‘But nobody wants to be quoted attacking this 
because Amazon is a key part of their business.

‘It’s the threat and power of Amazon – they have got the power to clamp down on these sellers.’

Last year the group was dubbed 
‘immoral’ by MPs after it paid just £1.8million in corporation tax in 
2011 despite sales of £3.35billion in the UK.

Vendor fees on electronic goods such 
as headphones and memory cards will go up from seven per cent to 12 per 
cent for the busiest UK-based traders from 4 April, according to a 
report in the Guardian.

Fees for UK traders using Amazon to sell automotive parts will go up from 12 per cent to 15 per cent.

Growing: Traders are the latest group to express concern at the seemingly unstoppable rise of the online giant, which has already been accused of jeopardising the future of the high street book shop

For German sellers offering tyres 
through the site, fees will rise from seven per cent to 10 per cent 
after the Easter weekend, while seller fees for French traders offering 
DVDs, music and video games on Amazon will go up from 10 per cent to 15 
per cent.

Small traders in the UK using the site to sell automotive parts will see fees go from 12 per cent to 15 per cent.

Traders
 have reacted with fury to the hikes, becoming the latest group to rail 
against the seemingly unstoppable rise of the online giant, which has 
already been accused of placing the future of the high street book shop 
in jeopardy. As independent bookshops continue to close at an alarming 
rate, Amazon credited e-book sales for Christmas sales of £13.5billion 
in 2012.

At the end of 2012
 the 'tax scrimping' retailer was branded 'immoral' after it emerged its
 UK arm had recorded a pre-tax profit of £74million the previous year - 
but paid just £1.8million in tax.

Third-party
 traders play a significant role in the online business, with two 
million globally selling through Amazon. In the pre-Christmas period in 
2012, two in five items bought on Amazon were sold by third-party 
traders.

Another British trader - who generates in excess of £1million in sales through Amazon - said the increases had prompted him to switch his attention to eBay, which he said offered a less costly means of doing business.

The seller said eBay also passed on payments to traders quickly, while Amazon holds on to payments for two to three weeks.

'It's a huge strain on a small 
business not being able to access cash we're owed from Amazon. And 
they're making an absolute fortune in interest.'

The traders who spoke out against Amazon did so on condition of anonymity amid concern over how the retailer would respond.

Similar increases came into effect in the U.S. in January.

Amazon could not be reached for comment.

In less than 20 years Amazon has gone from an online bookstore run from founder Jeff Bezos's garage, to the world's biggest online retailer.

One of the first big firms to start selling goods over the internet, Amazon rapidly diversified adding DVDs, CDs and video games to its online offering, along with clothes, furniture and toys.

Today the Seattle-based firm generates billions in profits and has separate websites in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Japan and China.

The popularity of ebooks is key to the success of the online giant, and Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year in a clear indication of the continued mass migration of shoppers from the high street to the web.

It racked up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from £10bn in the same period of the previous year. Kindle e-book sales -up a whopping 70 per cent - were credited for the surge in profits.

Overall sales were up by 22 per cent, driven by the popularity of Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet.
