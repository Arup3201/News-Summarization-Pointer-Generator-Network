Thief: Paul Leighton stole £250,000 from his opera house employer and spent it on cars, holidays and even a Manchester United season ticket

A 'greedy' finance director stole £250,000 from an opera house run with charitable donations and spent it on luxury cars, holidays and even a Manchester United season ticket.

Paul Leighton, 48, began defrauding the Buxton Opera House in Derbyshire five days after starting work there and spent a year siphoning cash into his own account.

He then blew the money on his lavish lifestyle and servicing his debts but was caught when unpaid suppliers complained to a colleague while he was away on another holiday.

After discovering the huge hole in their accounts The High Peak Theatre Trust, which runs the opera house, called in the police.

Leighton was jailed for two years at Derby Crown Court yesterday. 

Prosecutor Sarah Slater said after starting his job he transferred £7,000 into his account, followed by a further £25,000 just a few days later,

Leighton then set up a regular payment direct into his own account which he hid under the title 'payment ledger three'.

Between April 2012 and June 2013, he took a total of £244, 515.31. The last transaction was on June 24, five days before the thefts were discovered.

'It wasn't sophisticated, he was simply paying amounts into his personal account,' added Ms Slater.

As a result of the thefts the theatre lost £50,000 in Arts Council funding and the trust was concerned it may not survive.

Ms Slater said: 'A lot of people in the community rely upon the opera house in the Buxton area.'

Leighton, of Sale, Greater Manchester, who had no previous convictions, had earlier admitted fraud.

Sara Haque, defending, told the court the case had cost her client everything.

Before starting work at the opera house, he had decided to become self employed but it didn't work out, leaving him in debt, she said.

'The consequence was that at the time he began employment with Buxton Opera House he was in significant debt. He received a repossession order for the family house in February 2012.'

On the edge: Leighton's fraud left the Buxton Opera House, which is funded by charity, on the brink of going bust

He told his wife it was a misunderstanding and once he started work at the theatre, he began to steal in order to pay off his mortgage arrears and avoid having his house repossessed, Ms Haque said.

But he couldn't stop and became 'greedy', she added.

'He simply said once he paid off the debts, he would stop and then he found he couldn't. He began gambling in order to try and win the money back, but of course it couldn't be done.'

Sentencing him, Recorder Stephen Linehan QC, said: 'In 2012 you were employed as finance manager for the High Peak Trust who run the famous Buxton Opera House and as such you were given total control of finances.

'To do that you had access to the online banking system you had the passwords for that system and you were able to pay out at will.

'Within a few days of starting there you began to use your power to enrich yourself. You continued taking money until you had transferred just short of a quarter of million pounds in a period just under 12 months.'

The judge said he accepted the crimes began to pay off mounting debts, but he added that the evidence showed he then started using the cash to find a lifestyle way beyond his means.

'This was a gross breach of trust. It is not a rich organisation. You could not do what you did without causing serious financial damage and you knew it.'

Buxton Opera House was built in 1903 when the Derbyshire town was a popular spa and resort for Victorian holidaymakers. It was designed by Frank Matcham, who later drew up the plans for the London Palladium.
