Boris Johnson’s hopes of becoming Prime Minister have received a major boost after former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd hailed him as ‘the new Disraeli’.

A new book by the Conservative grandee mocks the way ‘every Tory leader’ – and Ed Miliband – since Disraeli has tried to associate themselves with the Victorian Prime Minister’s ‘One Nation’ brand of politics.

But he argues that the only one who can lay claim to be a modern Disraeli is Mr Johnson. While the London Mayor may be delighted by the comparison, Lord Hurd’s comments are double-edged.

Parallels: Benjamin Disraeli and Boris Johnson have a number of similarities, according to Lord Hurd

He says Disraeli’s greatness derives not from political achievements or principles, but from character and wit. Furthermore, writes Lord Hurd, Mr Johnston shares Disraeli’s reputation for ‘wicked’ behaviour with women and telling the truth.

‘According to accepted wisdom on modern politics, Boris Johnson should have been ruined years ago. He has been accused of all kinds of conventional wickedness, including being unfaithful and insulting the people of Liverpool. And yet his reputation has soared.

Argument: The former Foreign Secretary believes that Mr Johnson can capture Disraeli's appeal

‘Boris gets away with it because he is entertaining and makes good use of his education. Of course, there is a question of control. While Disraeli tried to keep his comedy in check and did not let his wit gallop away with him, Boris allows himself to be consumed by his own jokes. This makes it difficult when he wants to make a serious point.’

However, he concludes: ‘But, one way or another, Boris has nonetheless done today what Disraeli did in the 19th Century, namely raise the level of interest in politics up several pegs.’

Lord Hurd’s book, Disraeli: Or The Two Lives, studies how Queen Victoria’s favourite Prime Minister established a permanent hold on the Conservative Party despite being a ‘bankrupt Jewish school dropout and trashy novelist’.

He writes: ‘He held few principles which he was not ready to alter for the sake of immediate tactical gain.

‘Moreover, in Disraeli’s personal life, the negative side of the ledger is piled particularly high. He married for money after abandoning women who adored him.

‘If Disraeli were alive today he would despair at the lack of courage and bravery among our political classes. These days we are subjected to parliamentary performances that border on banal.’

Mr Johnston is ‘the most prominent exception who proves the rule’, says Lord Hurd.
