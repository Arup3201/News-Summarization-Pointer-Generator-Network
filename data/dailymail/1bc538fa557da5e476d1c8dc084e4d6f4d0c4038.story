A pregnant would-be glamour model who had a breast enlargement on the NHS has said she would consider giving up smoking - as long as the State paid for it.

Josie Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, is expecting her third child in two months, but continues to smoke 20 cigarettes a day.

Yesterday she told how she enjoys taxpayer-funded taxis on the school run, costing £6,000 a year, because she claimed she is so hated after having a free £4,800 breast operation that she cannot use public transport.

Today the single mother, who is pregnant after working as an escort girl, said she had cut down from 40 cigarettes a day to 20, but would need help from her GP to cut the habit completely.

Living off the state: Josie Cunningham, 23, from Leeds, says she will give up smoking, but it'll cost us

Unrepentant: Miss Cunningham taunted those angry about her use of public money via Twitter

She told The Sun: 'It's not illegal for me to smoke while pregnant' and boasted of halving her £18 a day habit.

Miss Cunningham, who would not comment further on her smoking comments today, added: 'I'm hoping my doctor will be able to help get me off the fags.  But the public will probably whinge about funding that as well.'

Yesterday she fuelled the fire of public outrage by posting a provocative tweet saying: 'Sticks and stone may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.'

Anti-smoking advice, counselling, drugs and patches are all available on the NHS, but at a cost to the taxpayer.

News that Miss Cunningham had had a breast augmentation, funded by the same NHS Trust that refused to fund surgery that would have enabled a two-year-old girl with a form of cerebral palsy to walk provoked outrage across the country.

Miss Cunningham later claimed her breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were ‘so big’ she found them embarrassing, and said the NHS should pay for a reduction.

Then she tried to placate public opinion by promising to pay back the cash.

Before and after: The former escort had a £4,800 breast operation on the NHS taking her from a 32A to a 36D

But when she became pregnant after working as a £1,000-a-night escort, she admitted she could not uphold her pledge – and now continues to soak up public funds.

She has had £1,500 of Botox treatment for excessive sweating, and two months ago, she boasted she would be having £2,500 of free dental work now she is expecting.  And earlier this year, the publicity-hungry mother threatened to have an abortion after being invited to go on Big Brother.

Yesterday Miss Cunningham told how she and her children, aged six and three, are driven two-and-a-half miles to and from the local school, twice a day.

The journey, which costs Leeds Council £30 a day,  would cost around £30 a week by bus, but Miss Cunningham insisted it was worth it, and said taxpayers should be grateful it was taxis rather than more expensive private hire cars.

This year Leeds council is having to make savings of £50million from its budget.

A spokesman said: 'We are not able to comment on individual cases. However, the council takes matters relating to attendance at school extremely seriously.'

There are plenty of services offered free on the NHS for those needing help to give up cigarettes.

GPs can provide patients with details of their local NHS Stop Smoking Service, which will offer help from trained advisers.

They can draw up a stop smoking plan, and available treatments may include counselling, nicotine patches, gum, inhalers, microtabs, lozenges, and nasal and mouth sprays.  The majority of these medicines are called nicotine replacement therapies (NRT).

Patients may also be offered two types of non-NRT medicines - Champix (varenicline) tablets or Zyban (buproprion) tablets.

There is also a Stop Smoking helpline, which is free to call, and various group therapies for those who prefer to tackle their problem with others.
