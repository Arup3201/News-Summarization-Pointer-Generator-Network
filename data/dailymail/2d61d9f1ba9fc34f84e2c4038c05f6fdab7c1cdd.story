The burglar was strung up to a 20ft wall by security guards for five hours after they caught him stolen goods

A burglar was strung up for five hours on a busy street by security guards after they caught him red-handed climbing out of an apartment block.

The 34-year-old man's arms were tied behind his back and a rope was looped under his arms and around his neck before being tied to a 20ft high wall.

The security guards who monitor the apartment block in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, are now facing false imprisonment charges.

The guards blindfolded the burglar 
and put him on display next to the stolen goods and a sign at his feet 
explaining what he had done.

They had caught him with an iPad, two watches, two mobile phones and a laptop, according to local media.

Police were eventually called five hours later on Saturday and the security guards are now being investigated.

'No matter what he did, these men can't stage a public hanging,' said a police spokesman

But the guards say the thief, who was also taken into custody, was in no danger.

'As long as he stayed upright he was perfectly safe,' said one.

'He had a choice of punishment by us or turning him over to the police and he chose us,' they added.

Security team lead Li Jian said he and two of his guards saw the man climbing down a drain pipe before they caught him.

The man's hands were tied and a rope was looped under his arms as he was made to hang for hours

Their actions were supported by a property manager at the block who said they stopped in from running away and helped stopped residents being criticised after a string of break-ins, reports China's Global Times.

One resident told the website that they agreed with what the guards did.

He said: 'This should teach him a lesson and serve as a warning for other burglars who are thinking about robbing from here.'

However, others said the man was 'entitled to dignity.'

The guards piled up stolen cash, an iPad, laptop and two watches that he allegedly stole from residents
