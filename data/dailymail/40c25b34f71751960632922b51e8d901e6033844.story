He was there to receive an investiture for his artwork from Prince Charles

But on a recent trip to Buckingham Palace cross-dressing potter Grayson Perry claims the heir to the throne shared a revealing secret.

As well as leaving the palace with a CBE, Mr Perry said he had discovered that the Prince confessed to wanting to wear his mother's clothes.

This is the moment when Mr Perry said that the prince of Charles made the revealing comment

Grayson Perry left the palace with a CBE and a confession from Prince Charles. The artist said the second in line to the throne admitted: 'There are a lot of my mother's clothes I've been wanting to try on for a while'

Mr Perry, 54, told The Sun: 'Charles did admit to me, 'There are a lot of my mother's clothes I've been wanting to try on for a while. The crown and jewels.'

At the ceremony, Mr Perry dressed in, what he referred to as an 'Italian mother of the bride outfit', complete with a black feathered hat, midnight blue dress and jacket.

The winner of the prestigious Turner Prize, which is presented to a British artist under 50, became the first male cross-dresser to collect a CBE wearing a dress. His outfit had been agreed with the palace before the event.

He is known for his controversial artwork which features themes such as child abuse. He has said that he loves using clay because 'it is held in such low esteem in the art world'.

Mr Perry said: 'Charles did admit to me, "There are a lot of my mother's clothes I've been wanting to try on for a while. The crown and jewels"'

Mr Perry realised he was a transvestite when he was a teenager and was thrown out of his family house in Chemsford, Essex.

He moved to London in 1980 and began attending pottery classes.

From there, the artist rose to fame and won Turner prize in 2003.

He said that the Turner honoured his 'hard graft' over 30 years.

Mr Perry was the first potter to be awarded the prestigious title.

His art depicts cultural steotypes as well as scenes from his childhood and family life.

He also addresses topics such as child abuse and sexuality in his work.

The potter is a tranvestite known for his alter-ego 'Claire' who he admits is modelled on Camilla Parker-Bowles.

He is married to Philippa Perry, a psychologist and has a 21-year-old daughter called Flo.

In pictures from the ceremony, the pair are seen to be chatting and smiling - but their conversation had previously not be revealed.

After the ceremony he said: 'Receiving this was great, it's not just for me it's for all the artists - no really it's just for me, for 30 years of hard graft.'

He admitted that his first thought before the event was: '"What am I going to wear?"

'It's a serious thing, I'm not going to compromise my identity as Britain's pre-eminent transvestite.

'I Googled to see what people wore and went for the sexier end. I always do like the older woman who makes an effort.'

Yet this is not the first time Mr Perry has commented on his January encounter with the Prince.

He told The Telegraph that the medal would not fit over his head because of the size of his hat which Mr Perry said amused Prince Charles. 

Clarence house declined to comment on the conversation between the prince and Mr Perry.

In an interview with Jonathan Dimbleby: 'I’m not very good at being a performing monkey … I’m not prepared to perform whenever they want me to perform.'

During a 1989 speech: '[I and others] wonder what it is about our country, and our society that our language has become so impoverished, so sloppy and so limited; that we have arrived at a wasteland of banality, cliché and casual obscenity.'

On nationalist protests in Wales: 'As long as I don’t get covered too much in egg and tomato I’ll be all right.'

In an interview with Jonathan Dimbleby: 'It’s not as if we’re all going off on junkets all the time on this
