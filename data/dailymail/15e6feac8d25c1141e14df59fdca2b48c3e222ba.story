A career criminal who sold a set of power tools on eBay to the former special constable they were stolen from avoided jail today.

Jonny Shaw was upset when police told him they would not investigate the £4,000 theft from his van so he surfed the internet until he found them and bought them back.

Mr Shaw then agreed to meet with seller Julian Morris to collect the tools, but also tipped off Lancashire Police who came with him to arrest the suspect, who later admitted handling stolen goods.

But despite trying to sell the stolen collection of electric saws, screwdrivers, drills and other maintenance tools, he was given a suspended prison sentence at Burnley Crown Court.

Caught: Julian Morris, left, was arrested after £4,000 of stolen tools he was selling on eBay were tracked down by the owner Jonny Shaw, right, who then called in the police

Detective work: The former special constable was upset when police failed to properly investigate so traced the tools himself 

This was because he insisted he had nothing to do with the thefts themselves and bought the tools at a car boot sale.  

The theft occurred last April after Mr Shaw left the work equipment in his Ford Transit van. His wallet containing £275 cash plus his sat nav were also stolen. 

Describing what happened next Mr Shaw told the court: 'I reported it to the police but they weren't doing anything about it and were just giving me a crime reference number - although an officer did come out to see me.

Initiative: Mr Shaw told police he was meeting Morris to collect the stolen tools, and they arrested him

'I was mad. I've had my tools stolen before and had to buy them again. I was going mad, this was my livelihood and a lot of people were let down because of it.

'I have 10 men working for me and we were having to hire tools in for three or four days. The lads couldn't work that day, it had a big effect for three or four days. It was an absolute nightmare.:

'I thought the tools would probably be sold on the internet so I had a look. I couldn't believe he had put them on so soon. I got robbed on a Tuesday and by the Thursday they were on Ebay. I kept a watch on them on the site and two days later he put some more on.

'I was zooming in on the pictures and the serial numbers'I thought 'they are definitely mine' and I thought 'I've got to win them'.

Mr Shaw successfully won the auction and contacted the seller to get his address, telling him he could come and collect them.

He added: 'I rang the (police) inspector and said that I knew they were mine straight away. He was really good and said he'd meet me round the corner of the address.

'On the day of the pick up I had my mate. This guy came out of the house and he had my tools. He kept coming to the door with everything else that had been robbed. I identified all the tools. I said to my mate that if I start coughing that means they are my tools.

'As soon as he came out I started coughing. The police came flying around the corner in a van and a car and started running up the drive. He had his back to them so he didn't know what was going on and they pinned him. Just before, I had said ' they are my tools'. He didn't know what to do, he said 'let me say sorry to my wife'. His wife and kids were there, I felt awkward because she was crying.

'I had all the receipts on me. All my tools are insured because of last time but works tools are not insured unless they are in a vault.

'When I found the tools the Burnley police were brilliant.

'After the inspector was saying 'good work'. It felt good. It felt good that I got it back, it was a relief. I always wanted to be in the police but when I did it I didn't like it - it was too much paperwork.

Sentencing: Morris, who also admitted possessing cannabis, was given eight weeks in jail, suspended for two years, with 100 hours unpaid work and must pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge

Morris's address was searched and officers returned further tools to Mr Shaw. Six items which had been stolen were not recovered including the wallet and £275 cash. Police also found a hand-written list of power tools. Morris' van was searched and four snap bags cannabis were found.

In interview Morris said he got the tools from somebody he knew who helped him on car boot sales - but refused to name. When questioned he added: ' I have done it because we are skint. Somebody said to me they had a load of drills to sell and offered me 20 per cent. I asked if they were dodgy and they said they weren't.' He had 14 offences on his record.

Morris who was also admitted possessing cannabis was given eight weeks in jail, suspended for two years, with 100 hours unpaid work and must pay £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

In mitigation defence lawyer Miss Sara Lyle, defending, said: 'He does a bit of everything, usually house maintenance. Work was scarce, he was offered the opportunity to sell the goods by a mate and foolishly took up that opportunity. He says he knew there was something dodgy about it but had absolutely nothing to do with the theft.

'He certainly doesn't know where the wallet and other personal items are. There is absolutely nothing sophisticated about this. He used his own name, his own eBay account and his own address.'
