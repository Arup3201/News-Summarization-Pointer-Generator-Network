A young man tracked down two muggers on Facebook after they robbed him at knifepoint while he was sitting in his car.

Daniel McGill, 21, and Gordon Alexander, 30, were jailed for a total of 19 years after Daniel Kaye found them on the social networking site.

The pair threatened the victim, 18, with a blade and demanded that he hand over his mobile phone and cash when he pulled over to answer a call.

Jailed: Daniel McGill, 21, and Gordon Alexander, 30, were both caught after being tracked down on Facebook

The thugs then cheekily ordered him to take off his t-shirt so they could polish his vehicle to remove their fingerprints in Darlington, County Durham.

After being traumatised by the attack, Mr Kaye searched Facebook for the people he thought were responsible for robbing him and found a picture of McGill.

He is believed to have been able to carry out the search because he recognised the attacker from the area.

By looking through the victim's Facebook friends, he was also able to name Alexander as one of the attackers, Teeside Crown Court heard.

A third person involved in the robbery has not been traced.

As they were jailed, McGill and Alexander cheered, whooped and laughed sarcastically.

Mr Kaye, an IT apprentice,  
said he still 
had nightmares about the attack.

'It was probably the most 
scared I’ve ever been in my life,' he said after the sentencing.

Knifepoint attack: The robbery happened close to this road in Darlington

'Having someone hold a knife to you is 
not something you ever want to happen.

'It still affects me. I have a 
lot of sleepless nights. I don’t go anywhere now without checking 
whether it’s safe to get out of the car.

'For a long time, I couldn’t 
relax. I’m a happy go-lucky guy. I’ve turned it round and want to put it
behind me now.'

McGill, from Darlington, was given seven years behind bars after being found guilty of robbing Mr Kaye on July 15 this year. He had denied any involvement.

Alexander, of no fixed address, was given 12 years as he was sentenced for two robberies and an attempted robbery.

A fortnight later he struck again in Darlington town centre when he knocked a 30-year-old man out with a knuckleduster during a violent attack.

The court heard that McGill also had a criminal past.

Judge Peter Fox told them: 'You both 
have bad records. There are a number of aggravating features to the 
first robbery . . . you were hunting in a pack with a third young man.

'You, McGill, were actually using a 
knife, inches away from your victim. It was at night. It was a cowardly 
attack in a public place. He fell into your predatory hands.'

Alexander’s barrister, Martin Towers,
said: 'These convictions represent his first for offences of robbery, 
but I have to concede, he has a bad record.'

Dan Cordey, for McGill, said: 'While 
he is facing his first adult custodial sentence, he is not somebody who 
this court should give up on. He can work.'

After the pair were led away 
cheering, the judge said: 'For anyone who may wish to review this matter
subsequently, I can only observe the laughter which I hear from the 
corridor behind the court.'
