Manchester United have confirmed that former first team fitness coach Tony Strudwick has moved to a role working predominantly with the club’s younger players.

Sportsmail revealed on Saturday that Strudwick’s job in charge of first team fitness work and planning had been taken by manager Louis van Gaal’s trusted aide Jos van Dijk. This switch was made at the start of the season.

Now United have confirmed the move, revealing that Strudwick’s new title is head of athletic development.

United said: 'At the start of this season Tony took on the role of head of athletic development. 

'Tony is now overseeing the athletic development of all players, working with Louis van Gaal for the first team right through to Paul McGuinness in the Academy.

'Introducing this new role and using Tony’s invaluable experience in sports science, which spans over 20 years, shows the club’s commitment on placing greater emphasis on developing players for long-term success.'

As reported here on Saturday, Strudwick’s work with the first team is now restricted to some warm up drills before training at Carrington and some strength work. 

He no longer has responsibilities on match day or takes charge of planning fitness programmes for first team stars, the role he had enjoyed at the club since arriving from Blackburn in 2007.

Strudwick said: 'I am thoroughly enjoying this new role. With increased importance on developing players for the future, the athletic component becomes critical in their advancement and to have the chance to work with the younger players, who are in the early stages of their career, as well as the first team, will give a continuity of progression which is critical to their future success.'
