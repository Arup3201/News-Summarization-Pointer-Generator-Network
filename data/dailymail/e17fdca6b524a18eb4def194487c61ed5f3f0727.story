Former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride was forced to resign for smearing opposition MPs while working for Gordon Brown

Ed Miliband was always the first down the pub for a drink and a gossip but now spends his time ‘walking round Hampstead Heath in a suit approaching people like a Mormon’, a disgraced former colleague has claimed.

Damian McBride, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor, said the Labour leader - a 'white wine man' - was ‘very sociable’ and the one to say: ‘Right, down to the bar’.

But Mr McBride, who was forced to resign for smearing Tory MPs while working for Mr Brown, said Mr Miliband now had far too many people around him ‘saying he should do this or do that’ which was stopping him from being himself.

Mr McBride said one of the Labour leader’s greatest assets was that he was normal but was making ‘ludicrous’ decisions which were harming his chances of making it to Number 10.

The former Downing Street aide, speaking to Fubar radio, also criticised Mr Miliband’s conference speech – accusing him of forgetting to mention the deficit because he believes it’s Ed Balls’ responsibility.

He also hit out at the ‘unnecessary’ anecdotes which Mr Miliband littered through his address about meeting ordinary people.

Mr McBride said: ‘I didn’t think it was his best week.’ He said he should have come out and said: ‘Look it is my programme for government, this is what I want’.

But he said Mr Miliband got ‘muddled up with all this stuff about wandering around Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill and meeting people’. He added: ‘That was just unnecessary.’

He said the Labour leader was much more normal than he came across, adding: ‘I tell you what he doesn’t show that side of himself.’ Mr McBride added that this was ‘the best, almost the great thing, about him.’

He said: ‘Ed Miliband’s a fantastic gossip, he is one of those people always wanting to know which civil servants were going out which civil servants, and if someone had had a break up and, you know, what happened and you know, was so and so cheating on so and so.

‘He was interested in people and a very funny guy; a very dry wit and you don’t see that at all. That doesn’t come a cross and I think he needs to do more.’

Asked if he had ever seen Mr Miliband drunk, Mr McBride said: ‘Probably not drunk, I think he handles his drink quite well.’

But he said on one foreign trip with Gordon Brown ‘Ed was the man in charge deciding what we were all doing and every night he was the person saying, “right down to the bar at seven o’clock” and choosing where we would go to for dinner and that sort of thing’. He added: ‘He is very sociable.’

Mr McBride said the Labour leader and his shadow chancellor Ed Balls were ‘two lively guys and they were very close at that time’.

But he said that Mr Miliband had changed after his spin doctors had got hold of him.

He said: ‘The only time I met Ed Miliband in the last five years was wondering around a park.

‘He was out pushing his daughter in a pram with his wife.

‘I was coming up to this guy and I thought, you want to be the Prime Minister and you are wearing a light orange T-shirt and some luminous pink shorts and I just wanted to say to him, “You have got to start dressing better if you are going out in public”.

‘I think he now walks around Hampstead Heath in a suit approaching people like a Mormon asking what they think about our country’s future.’

Mr McBride said the Labour’s leader’s conference speech gaffe, when he forgot to mention the deficit, was ‘a revealing slip’.

He said: ‘As far as he is concerned the deficit is Ed Balls problem. He think Ed Balls has to deal with that.’ Mr McBride added that the Labour leader also feels ‘uncomfortable with the question of immigration’.

‘As the son of immigrants he feels positive about immigration and feels uncomfortable with aping the Nigel Farage rhetoric,’ he said.

But Mr McBride said the Labour leader needed to ditch his gang of spin doctors.

He said: ‘He has too many people around him saying he should do this or do that.

‘When Tony Blair was about to become Prime Minister, he had one person around him – Alistair Campbell. In the days before Gordon Brown became Prmie Minister, that was my job. Ed Milliband has literally a dozen people advising him on the Press and that is too many.

‘You get pulled in all different directions. That leads to ludicrous things like The Sun embarrassing him because he didn’t wear this wristband doing Help For heroes.’
