From the perkily named Pershing's Crusaders to the more ponderously titled When The Kaiser Does The Goose-Step (To A Good Old American Rag), patriotic songs were once almost as popular as their poster equivalent.

Now, with the World War One centenary almost upon us, a selection of beautifully illustrated sets of sheet music have been released to mark the occasion.

Along with Pershing's Crusaders and When The Kaiser Does The Goose-Step, others include We're Goin' To Knock The 'Hel' Out Of Willhelm and We're Going Over.

Patriotic: Jaunty American songs such as We're Going Over celebrated the US entry into WW1

Although most hail from the US, where patriotic tunes have long been part of popular culture, others come from the UK and include such ditties as Your King & Country Want You.

While Your King & Country Want You is little remembered, others such as Keep The Home Fires Burning, remained popular well into the 1960s.

Written by composer Ivor Novello with the help of Lena Gilbert Ford - a woman who was not, as is sometimes reported, his mother - the ballad speaks of men 'summoned from the hillside' and 'called from the glen' and sent off to war.

Despite the tragedy that awaited many, the song exhorts listeners to 'keep the home fires burning' and to 'turn the dark cloud inside out until our boys come home'.

Jaunty: Paul Stewart and Jack Frost both wrote songs that confidently predicted victory over the Kaiser

Another, It's A Long Way To Tipperary, was jauntier and proved enormously popular with soldiers marching off to war.

Among them were the Connaught Rangers, an Irish regiment, who were recorded walking through Boulogne singing the tune by Daily Mail correspondent, George Curnock.

Like many British patriotic songs, it spoke less of great deeds on the battlefield and more of a poignant longing for home.

By contrast, many of the scores that originate in the US are more martial in nature and speak confidently of victory.

First off the mark: Paul A. Rubens' recruiting song won royal approval and was released as war began in 1914

One, God Bless America, which was composed by Irving Berlin in 1918, is now considered an unofficial national anthem, while even the distinctly unpatriotic likes of George M. Cohen - the man behind patriotic parody Yankee Doodle Dandy - were moved to create popular tunes for soldiers.

Cohen's 1917 work, Over There, exhorted young Americans to join up and called on every 'son of Liberty' to go and fetch their guns.

But whether upbeat or packed with longing for home, the soldiers singing the ditties were headed for horrors from which many never returned.

From It's A Long Way To Tipperary to Over There, the songs today are a poignant reminder of a generation lost to war a century ago.
