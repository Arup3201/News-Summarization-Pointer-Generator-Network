Britain's most polluting and least fuel-efficient 'gas-guzzling' cars are driven by motorists in London, a new report reveals today.

By contrast Peterborough is the nation's 'green' car capital.

Data from the Government's DVLA data that vehicles in London kick out 176.95 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre on average – equivalent to around 40mpg.

Britain's least fuel-efficient cars are driven by motorists in London, a new report has revealed

That is 25 per cent more than in Peterborough which has Britain's least polluting cars doing 50 mpg and emitting 142.03g/km.

The top 10 dirtiest towns and cities also include St Albans and Brighton where pollution levels have breached EU safety limits along with congestion hotspots Cambridge and Chelmsford.

Lisburn, Hereford, Newry, Oxford and Norwich are also among those places named and shamed for high greenhouse exhaust gases.

Along with Peterborough, the cleanest cars are found in Portsmouth, Stirling, Worcester and Glasgow, as well as Birmingham, Durham, Sunderland, Exeter and Gloucester.

London vehicles were the worst offenders, with those in St Albans and Cambridge also in the top five

The figures were compiled by car insurance price comparison website Confused.com based on the postcodes for registered owners of 34,697,151 vehicles.

Vehicle emissions in the worst ten cities are far in excess of the 128.3g/km average for new cars sold last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.

In London, they are not far short of the 2000 figure of 181g/km, which is 41 per cent higher than the 2013 new car average.

1. London: 176.95

2. St Albans: 165.52

3. Brighton: 165.34

4. Cambridge: 164.70

5. Chelmsford: 163.91

6. Lisburn: 163.73

7. Hereford: 163.67

8. Newry: 163.38

9. Oxford: 162.78

10. Norwich: 162.59 

1. Peterborough: 142.03

2. Portsmouth: 146.69

3. Stirling: 147.38

4. Worcester: 150.21

5. Glasgow: 150.35

6. Birmingham: 150.58

7. Durham: 151.36

8. Sunderland: 153.10

9. Exeter: 153.43

10. Gloucester: 154.08

Confused.com also commissioned a OnePoll survey of 2,000 adults that found more than a third – 36 per cent - have no idea what their vehicle emits in CO2.

More than half (52 per cent) consider it important to reduce emissions and 29 per cent own a low emission car along with nine per cent who consider theirs to be 'eco-friendly.'

But a third (33 per cent) cannot afford to buy a low emission car and nearly four out of ten (37 per cent) say the Government should do more to make them affordable in addition to a grant of £5,000 for electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

Birmingham is in the top 10 for cities with the greenest vehicles

More than half (52 per cent) say councils should do more to promote alternative travel including buses, trains, cycling and walking.

The survey found that most people are dependent on their car to get work, with 62 per cent using it to commute compared to just 19 per cent who take public transport and eight per cent who walk.

Confused.com today also publishes a report entitled Carless Cities which examined the possibility of banning cars from city centres within 20 years to cut pollution.

It said Department of Health figures estimate that 28,416 deaths in Great Britain in 2010 were attributable to particulate air pollution – largely from diesel vehicle exhaust emissions – including 3,389 in London alone.

'That ranks pollution as a far bigger killer than traffic accidents,' it said.

'To put it into context, Department for Transport figures state that there were 1,713 road deaths in all of Great Britain in 2013.

'It is estimated that, depending on the area, between 6 per cent and 9 per cent of deaths in London are caused by airborne man-made particles.'

The report suggests that people are 'falling out of love with the car' in London and other big cities where there are better public transport services.

'The best way to reduce traffic congestion is to make public transport and green transport so much more attractive that people tend to think of it naturally, rather than cars,' said report contributor David Crawford, of traffic management magazine ITS International.
