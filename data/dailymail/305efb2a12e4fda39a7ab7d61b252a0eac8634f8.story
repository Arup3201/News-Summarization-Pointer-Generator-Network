Per Mertesacker has described his frustration after Arsenal conceded late against Liverpool to squander a 2-1 lead.

Arsenal came back from a goal down through Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud, only to let Martin Skrtel convert a header in the dying moments - and Mertesacker appeared to duck out of the way. 

'We realised we had to stick together and find space [and knew] if we got chances in the second half we could have scored,' Mertesacker told Arsenal's official website. 'We did and then we tried to defend in the last minute, which we did but not as good as I thought [we could have].

'Overall we have to take responsibility for our game - we want to dictate but we were on always on the back foot.'

Last season Arsenal were thrashed 5-1 in the same fixture, but will still be disappointed to have only taken a point from this season's encounter.

Arsenal sit 6th in the Premier League going into the Christmas period, 12 points off leaders Chelsea, and need to kick-start their season to close in on the top four.

'I'm not really pleased with the performance but we take the point now and we're looking forward to December 26,' Mertesacker continued. 'We have to dig in now and try to beat QPR.

'When you compare [the 2-2 draw] to last year, this is a much better result but I'm not very pleased with our performance. We can do much better and we have to find it.'

On Boxing Day last year, the Gunners were top of the Premier League tree. This season though, it will take a strong second half for them to be rewarded with Champions League football come May.
