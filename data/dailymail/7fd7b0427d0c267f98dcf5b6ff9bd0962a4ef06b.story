All the talk of late has suggested the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting a girl.

Perhaps Prince Charles might start praying for a grandson after being given a tiny blue and white babygrow in the style of Formula 1 racing overalls for his future grandchild today.

The prince was visiting the Williams F1 facility at the Qatar Science and Technology Park in Doha today on the second leg of his tour of the Middle East.

Williams F1 CEO Alex Burns presented Charles with racing overalls for the future monarch in Qatar today

Charles was presented with a Williams F1 babygrow in the style of racing overalls for his future grandchild by the team's CEO as he visited the Qatar Science and Technology Park

The belt of the babygrow was embroidered with 'HRH' - for His or Her Royal Highness - just like Formula 1 drivers have their initials on their racing overalls

Charles seemed tickled pink by the gift for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child, due in July

He was presented with the adorable jumpsuit in the team colours by the company's CEO, Alex Burns.

'Here is something we have had embroidered for your future grandchild, Sir, very many congratulations,' he said.

Mr Burns explained that F1 drivers normally have their names embroidered on the belt, so in this case they had used the letters HRH - His (or Her) Royal Highness.

Charles looked tickled pink at the gift and chucked when one onlooker suggested: 'Let's hope it's a boy!'

'How lovely,' he said.

'Thank you very, very much. That is very kind of you.'

The Williams Technology Centre in Qatar was established in 2009 to develop and commercialise technologies with their origins in F1.

Charles was persuaded to get behind the wheel of a simulator at the Science and Technology Park, though he was reluctant to wear his seatbelt

Charles visited the Science and Technology Park in Qatar during a three-day visit

It is currently working on two projects: a vehicle simulator to help improve road safety and the development of an storage system for renewable energy.

The prince was persuaded to try his hand at the simulator which has the seat and dash board of a Range Rover and uses a detailed 3D recreation of the streets of Doha.

Despite it being a road safety simulator Charles wasn't keen to buckle up.

'Do I have to put my seat belt on,' he asked.

'Well you should do as this is a road safety demonstration,' he was told, The prince was eventually told that he didn't need to comply.

Charles laughed and chuckled as he drove fairly carefully through the virtual reality city.

Afterwards he said; 'I think I might need a sea sickness tablet.'
