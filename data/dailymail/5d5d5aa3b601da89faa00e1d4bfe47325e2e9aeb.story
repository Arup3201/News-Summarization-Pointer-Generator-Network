It was branded by Winston Churchill as 'one of the finest expositions of the British art of muddling through.'

But now China has stepped in to rebuild Kenya's historic 'Lunatic Line',120 years after British colonialists sacrificed more than 2,500 lives to lay the original track.

The £3.8billion project will run from Nairobi to Mombasa and eventually link to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and South Sudan.

Under the agreement, signed today, China will finance 90 per cent of the railway while the Kenyan government will foot the rest.

Dangerous: Construction began in Mombasa in 1895. Work was hampered by storms, strikes, local hostility, disease and lion attacks. Some 2,500 workers, many of them labourers imported from India, as they toiled in the heat to meet their imperial masters' ambitious timetable

Early days: Construction of the original line began in Mombasa 1895 and the railway reached Nairobi in 1899. By December 1901, it had reached the shore of Lake Victoria

Construction work on the standard gauge line is expected to start in October this year, and the 610 km (380-mile) stretch from the coast to Nairobi is due to be finished in early 2018.

The deal was signed at State House in Nairobi and witnessed by presidents Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Salva Kiir of South Sudan as well as Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang.

Open Africa: Railway men pose for a photograph on a railway trolley in the middle of a bridge in 1885. The aim then was to create a route linking Mombasa to Uganda, the source of the Nile and to open up Africa's 'interior'

Trouble ahead: But huge costs - both financial and in human life - drew strong opposition and the project soon became known as the 'Lunatic Line'

Man eaters: Lt Col John Henry Patterson (pictured with one of the two dead Tsavo Man-Eaters) described how he and his workers became drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with two lions, claiming they ate 135 men before he killed them

'This 
project demonstrates that there is equal cooperation and mutual benefit 
between China and the East African countries, and the railway is a very 
important part of transport infrastructure development,' Li said.

The Tsavo Man-Eaters are the most notorious lions in history who terrorised the British-led team of railway-bridge builders at Kenya's  Tsavo river in 1898.

Over a nine-month reign of terror, the two maneless male lions would sneak into the labourers' camp in the dead of night and snatch men from their tents, devouring them on site.

Terrified workers built snares, thorn fences and bonfires to scare them off but the beasts simply crawled under or leapt over them to reach their prey.

The number of victims varies wildly between accounts.

Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson, who oversaw the project and ultimately killed the beasts, claimed they had slain 135 men, though that number is generally accepted to be a generous exaggeration.

Current estimates remain somewhere between 30 and 70 dead.

After several attempts to hunt down and kill the lions, Patterson finally shot one from scaffold on December 9 1898. It measured 3m, from head to tail.

He killed the second 20 days later after shooting it nine times, and recorded the story in his 1907 book The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.

The tale has since been made into three films, most recently the 1996 movie The Ghost of Darkness, starring Val Kilmer, as Patterson, and Michael Douglas.

After 25 years as Patterson's floor rugs, the lions' skins were eventually sold to the Chicago Field Museum in 1924 for $5,000 where they were stuffed and put on display (pictured).

Kenyatta
 hailed the booming relationship with China, calling it one 'based on 
mutual trust' and saying Kenya 'has found an honourable partner in 
China'.

Construction
 of the original line began in Mombasa 1895 and the railway reached 
Nairobi in 1899. By December 1901, it had reached the shore of Lake 
Victoria.

But building the line proved no easy task for the British.

The aim then was to create a route linking Mombasa to Uganda, the source of the Nile and to open up Africa's 'interior'.

But huge costs - both financial and in human life - drew strong opposition and the project soon became known as the 'Lunatic Line'.

Disease and attacks by wild animals killed some 2,500 workers, many of them labourers imported from India, as they toiled in the heat to meet their imperial masters' ambitious timetable.

Lt Col John Henry Patterson, who oversaw the construction of a railway bridge over the Tsavo river in Kenya in 1898, described how he and his workers became drawn into a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a local pride of lions.

'Our work was soon interrupted in a rude and startling manner,' he wrote.

'Two most voracious and insatiable man-eating lions appeared upon the scene and for over nine months waged an intermittent warfare against the railway and all those connected with it in the vicinity of Tsavo.'

One of the lions' many victims was the unfortunate superintendent Charles Ryall, who was dragged from his carriage and killed by one of the beasts.

Lt Col Patterson's story was later dramatised in the 1996 movie The Ghost of Darkness, starring Val Kilmer, as Patterson, and Michael Douglas.

For a brief period, the 660-mile track proved a success, despite its massive cost, opening up Africa's 'interior' to tradesmen and colonists and transforming the region.

Tellingly, Winston Churchill, who later shot zebra from the train, called it 'one of the finest expositions of the British art of muddling through'.

But over the years it was blighted by bandit raids, corruption and neglect. Now trains are infrequent and slow, running at little more than around 15mph.

There have also been numerous derailments and delays in recent years, sparking serious safety fears and a resulting passenger exodus.

Kenyan economist Aly-Khan Satchu told The Telegraph that China’s new engagement with Africa was 'very similar to the British engagement in the past: railways, roads, bridges, major infrastructure'.

With president Kanyatta about to face trial for alleged crimes against humanity, Kenyan relations with the West has become strained.

Britain has reduced its dealings with him to 'essential' contact only.

China, however, has seen Kenya's alienation from the West as a gaping opportunity and eagerly stepped in.

Chinese car manufacturers and television stations all operate in Kenya while an 
  English edition of China Daily is now printed in the capital, Nairobi.

Danger: But over the years it was blighted by bandit raids, corruption and neglect. Now trains are infrequent and slow, running at little more than around 15mph

Hopes that the new line will boost Kenya's economy - already running at a healthy 5 per cent growth - and its government claim it will knock some 79 per cent off the cost of running freight across the country.

But critics say it represents a starkly one-way trade relationship between China and Kenya. Kenya’s exports to China totalled just £32 million last year, compared with imports of £1.2 billion.

'Kenyatta feels he needs to rebalance towards China in particular,' said Mr Satchu. 'It’s clear why — China is Mr Moneybags, and we need loads of money to leapfrog our infrastructure to modern standards. But the president’s tone and language have been seen as quite dismissive to Kenya’s old friends.'
