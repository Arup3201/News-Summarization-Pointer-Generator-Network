Oscar Pistorius has been handed the dubious chance to resurrect his athletics career after being sentenced to what could be as little as 10 months’ imprisonment for shooting his girlfriend dead.

Although Pistorius was sentenced to five years for the manslaughter of 29-year-old model Reeva Steenkamp, his own legal team said he need serve only one sixth of the term behind bars.

The double amputee could then be placed under house arrest at his uncle Arnold’s mansion — a former rectory — on Lawley Street in Waterkloof, a plush Pretoria suburb that housed National Party grandees in the apartheid years.

Unlike the cell at Pretoria’s main prison where Pistorius spent last night, the high walls and electric fences at his uncle’s house are there to keep the criminals out.

Some legal experts said Pistorius would be allowed to leave the house to train and possibly to compete.

However, the International Paralympic Committee told Sportsmail that the athlete could not run in their competitions until 2019, when his full five-year term will have elapsed.

An IPC spokesman confirmed: ‘It is 2019 as far as we are concerned. The only way that could change is if he successfully appealed against the judgment.’

That means Pistorius will miss the Rio Paralympics in 2016, but could be free to take part in Tokyo four years later.

By then he would be 33 — a year older than Linford Christie when he won the 100 metres gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics.

Neither the IAAF — the governing body of athletics — nor the International Olympic Committee would comment on the sporting implications of Tuesday's sentencing by Judge Thokozile Masipa.

The IOC limited themselves to saying the case was a ‘human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius’ and that they ‘hope time will bring comfort to all those concerned’.

Regardless of eligibility, Pistorius is unlikely to compete against able-bodied opponents again. It was remarkable that he did so in the first place at London 2012. Then he was in his mid-20s, and a repeat effort may now be beyond his mental and physical capabilities.

Pistorius, who was impassive as he stood to hear the sentence, is said by his management to think it too early to contemplate a return to the track.

A disincentive to competing again — apart from the opprobrium that he would face — is the impossibility of ever earning anything like as lavishly as he did when he wore a halo: the back jacket of his autobiography hailed him ‘one of the most inspirational figures on the planet — from immobilised child to world-class sprinter’.

At his peak Pistorius earned £300,000 from athletics and a further £1million from sponsorship annually.

He had a £450,000 property portfolio, including the marble-floored bachelor pad on Pretoria’s guarded Silverwoods Estate — the house in which he killed Steenkamp with four shots through the bathroom door on February 14 last year.

Pistorius has since sold all his houses and cars to pay his legal bills. His defence team called him ‘broke and broken’.

Deals with Nike, BT, Oakley and French designers Thierry Mugler have all long stopped. However, his family’s wealth from mineral mining means he is probably not destitute.

The National Prosecuting Authority, who charged Pistorius with premeditated murder, have 14 days to decide whether to appeal.

But June Steenkamp, the victim’s mother, seemed to have had enough, saying: ‘I’m just so glad it’s over.’

Arnold Pistorius, whose hands Oscar clasped as he was led away at North Gauteng High Court, spoke for his family and nephew: ‘We accept the judgment,’ he said. ‘Oscar will embrace the opportunity to pay back society.’
