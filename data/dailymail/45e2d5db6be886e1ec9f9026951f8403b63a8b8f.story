Many couples jet off on holiday to revive the romance in their relationships but it appears time away together may do more harm than good.

New research suggests that a third of women end up fancying their partner less after a trip abroad.

And it appears the main turn-offs are peeling skin from a nasty sunburn, heat stroke and a relationship’s biggest killer: plain old boredom.

New research suggests that a third of women end up fancying their partner less after a trip abroad

Too much booze: A quarter of respondents complained that their man drank too much during their holiday

Too much sun: The main turn-offs are sunburnt skin, heat stroke and boredom

The findings are based on a survey commissioned by online travel agent Sunshine.co.uk, which polled 2,364 British women who had been on holiday with their partner in the last year.

Thirty-two per cent revealed that they were ‘less attracted’ to their partner once they returned to the UK.

While the effects of the sun played some part, for 35 per cent it was simply spending too much time together that put them off.

Another quarter (26 per cent) said their man drank too much and one in five (19 per cent) was upset because their partner was ogling other women.

Going in different direction: Thirty-five per cent said they spent too much time with their partner

Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of all respondents admitted they would rather go on a girls’ trip than a getaway with their partner while one in six would even prefer a holiday with family members.

But it’s not all bad news for men out there as 41 per cent of women said they were keener on their partner after a holiday in the sun.

Most said it was because their men took better care of themselves, were nicer to be around and had shed some pounds to look good on the beach.

Chris Clarkson, managing director of Sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘If you’ve never been on holiday with a partner before it can be quite daunting known that you’re going to be with them 24/7, especially if you aren’t used to living together.

‘People are generally more relaxed on holiday, so bad habits can emerge which may be off-putting, but people should just enjoy being together and not having anything to worry about for a week or two.’

He added: ‘If, by the end of the holiday, you’re feeling more unsure about your partner than when you set off, it’s probably time to call it a day.’
