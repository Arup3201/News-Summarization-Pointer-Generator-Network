A scandal-hit hospital exposed by The Mail on Sunday has been savaged in a new report by health inspectors and accused of ‘failing to protect the safety and welfare of patients’.

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has threatened to fine the NHS foundation trust which runs Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Berkshire, unless it makes ‘urgent improvements’.

Delivering a damning verdict, CQC inspectors, who made an unannounced four-day visit to the hospital, also said staff complained of bullying by managers and felt they could not raise concerns about standards.

In addition, they found short-staffed wards and evidence of poor record keeping.

Poor standards of cleanliness and inadequate infection control were highlighted and the inspectors said patients’ privacy and dignity were not always respected.

The CQC plans more inspections at Wexham Park, which serves more than 440,000 people, and a spokeswoman said it could impose fines if standards stayed low.

The latest verdict on the hospital follows this newspaper’s exposé of a secret report commissioned by hospital bosses into claims of medical blunders and feuding consultants dating back 14 years.

Whistleblower and consultant Anil Desai said up to 50 people may have died.

His claims were dismissed but the official report, leaked to the MoS, supported him.

A trust spokesman said: ‘We will continue to work hard to drive the improvements we all want to see.’
