They may not be as beautiful as the recent Galapagos Islands images, or as immersive as being able to virtually sail along the canals of Venice, but Google’s latest StreetView shots are a lot more useful. 

The tech firm has mapped over 50 train and tube stations across the world, 16 international airports and a cable car in Hong Kong to help travellers find their way around.

Flyers can also walk around an A380 plane stationed on the concourse at Dubai Airport to find their seat or compare leg room.

Scroll down to use the interactive map and view the list of stations included

More than 50 train and tube stations, 16 international airports, a cable car in Tokyo and an A380 plane on a concourse in Dubai, pictured, have been captured using Google's StreetView Trekker backpacks. Travellers can explore the plane, compare leg room and even pick a seat

The Street View Trekker backpacks took more than a year to develop.

The 40lb backpack features 15MP cameras, an on-board hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day.

Cameras are positioned around a sphere mounted on a pole to give a 360-degree view.

Google staff can then walk around locations capturing every possible angle.

These images are stitched together to form the StreetView shots.

The images make it possible for people to familiarise themselves with the layout of stations, discover the nearest toilet or departure board and even find their check-in desk.

They also give an insight into how accessible stations are for wheelchair users or parents. 

And to help tourists further, Google has created an interactive map that plots all of these new additions to its StreetView service to make them easier to find. 

Click a marker on the map below to see what its pointing at and then click the shortened link to go straight to that transport depot. The latitude and longitude coordinates are also listed. 

In the UK there are a total of 15 train stations plotted on the map including the main stations in London, such as Waterloo, pictured, Kings Cross and Victoria, as well as Manchester's Piccadilly, Liverpool Lime Street and Glasgow Central

One of the most unusual and unique locations among Google's new images including the Ngong Ping Cable Car station on the Lantau Island in Hong Kong, pictured. It connects Tung Chung, on the north coast of Lantau, to central Hong Kong via the hills in the Ngong Ping region

The north terminal of Gatwick Airport is also featured, but the south terminal isn't. Heathrow Airport doesn't feature either, yet.

Google claims the images make it possible for travellers to familiarise themselves with the layout of stations, discover the nearest toilet or departure boards and even find their check-in desk at locations including Madrid's Barajas airport, pictured

There are no transport stations or 
airports mapped in North America, but in Central America travellers can 
explore Mexico’s Benito Juárez International Airport.

A
 handful of subway stations have also been captured including a 
selection of stops on the Minatomirai Line in Yokahama, Japan. A 
highlight is the eerily empty Nihondori Station. Stops along the Osaka 
Municipal Subway have also been mapped on StreetView.

On board the A380, flyers can explore the lower deck of the airbus jet, find individual seat numbers, compare the leg room in economy versus premium economy and even locate the nearest toilets and exits. Unfortunately, first class can’t be accessed and neither can the cockpit, for security reasons. .

Ulf Spitzer, Google StreetView 
program manager said: ‘Now you can visit the check-in counter of your 
airline in Madrid, map out the way from baggage claim to the bus at 
Tokyo International Airport and check out where to pick up your rental 
car at Eindhoven Airport; you can even scope out your seat on an 
Emirates flight from Dubai.

Or,
 if you’re planning to take the train, navigate through Waterloo station
 so you can be one step ahead, whether you’re with a group of friends, 
family or a baby stroller.’

Google is planning to map more transport locations and will add them to the interactive map in future.
