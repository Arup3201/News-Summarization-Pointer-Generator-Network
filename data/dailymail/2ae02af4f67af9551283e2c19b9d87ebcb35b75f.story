Should a water-pipe ever burst in Kensington Palace, and Kate and William suddenly find themselves in need of a hotel for a night, there's now one in London that can cater specifically for their eagerly-awaited Baby of Cambridge.

Inspired by the promise of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child (and the resulting international baby boom), Grosvenor House - located on Park Lane opposite Hyde Park - has collaborated with bespoke royal
nursery designers Dragons of Walton Street.

Together the partnership will transform one of the luxury hotel's
Premium Park View suites into a nursery, designed and tailored with a certain royal baby in mind.

Both the hotel and Dragons of Walton 
Street have historic associations with the Royal family, with Princes 
William and Harry and their cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie all 
growing up in Dragons nurseries.

Still in the design stages, the first central London luxury hotel nursery of its kind, Grosvenor House's baby bedroom will be called Suite Dreams, and aims 'to provide parents with a quintessentially British, unique home-from-home experience'.

The room, fit for a future king or queen, will be fitted with 1920s-style furnishings in keeping with the hotel's traditional bedroom suites for adults.

Dragons of Walton Street will 
create a beautiful selection of hand-crafted and hand-painted furniture,
 with intricate illustrations representing elements of London's Hyde 
Park, the history of Grosvenor House and the Royal family.

There will be three bespoke (and aptly named) packages available for the nursery: Buckingham, Windsor and Clarence.

The grand Buckingham package - a three-night stay starting from £6,270 - includes a range of luxurious pampering activities, from a complimentary cut and blow dry at Sanrizz for mum, a men's shave at Alfred Dunhill for, as well as a private consultation with the Dragons of Walton Street.

Lorna O'Neill, Communications Director at Grosvenor House said: 'Partnering with Dragons of Walton Street is quite simply the perfect fit for our Suite Dreams nursery, in light of our own royal patronage dating back to 1929.

'The designs are exquisite, and to know they are just for Grosvenor House, with a royal baby in mind, is really exciting.

'Each piece of furniture tells a story, and we're thrilled to be offering our guests with young children a unique, memorable and royal experience that will live with them long after their stay with us, and of course be celebrating the arrival of the Royal baby in this way.'

Lucinda Croft, Dragons of Walton Street MD, said: 'We are absolutely thrilled to be working with Grosvenor House in creating this simply magical suite that will be fit for a future king or queen.

'Both Dragons of Walton Street and Grosvenor House have impressive royal heritage, so it seemed completely natural to join together to celebrate the new arrival in this way.

'Going away to a hotel with a new baby can be such a palaver, but every issue has been taken care of so visitors to London can arrive without a care in the world.'

The 'Suite Dreams' package will be available to pre-book from May 2013, and officially open to the public from June.
