French actor Gerard Depardieu failed to turn up at a Paris court today to face drunken driving charges because he had clashing professional commitments abroad.

Depardieu's lawyer Eric de Caumont said his client was not trying to dodge French justice, but is abroad 'meeting the producers of a movie,' whose filming in New York will begin in January. 

The actor flew to the Montenegro film festival this morning, having attended the Ballon d’Or football prize-giving ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland, last night.

Caumont suggested on BFM-TV that the 
movie role he was discussing will see Depardieu play the disgraced former 
International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn.

The 64-year-old star of films such as Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac was picked up last November by police after he fell off his scooter in northwest Paris.

The drunken driving hearing will now be deferred to a criminal court, and he could lose his driving license and be jailed for up to two years, Caumont said.

Depardieu has caused controversy in recent weeks for other reasons.

On Saturday he received a Russian 
passport from President Vladimir Putin, after threatening to return his 
French passport after Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault called him 
'pathetic' for deciding to move to tax-friendly Belgium.

The actor,has been accused of betrayal after quitting his homeland to avoid a new 75 per cent tax rate for millionaires.

Putin said last month that Depardieu would be welcome in Russia, which has a flat income tax rate of 13 percent, compared to the tax on income over 1 million euros ($1.3million) that Hollande wants to levy in France.

He also offered Depardieu a Russian 
passport, saying he had a close, special relationship with France and 
had developed warm ties with the actor, even though they had rarely met.

The Russian president and Depardieu 
were shown on state-run Channel One shaking hands and hugging each other
early as they met at Putin's residence in the Black Sea town of Sochi, 
during what the Kremlin said was a private visit by the actor to Russia.

'A brief meeting between the 
president and Depardieu took place,' said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry 
Peskov. “On the occasion of his visit to Russia, he was handed a Russian
passport.”

Peskov did not say whether Putin 
personally gave Depardieu the passport or if he picked it up through 
standard procedures. He said the actor also told Putin about his career 
plans.

In
a much publicized letter in December, Depardieu also made reference to 
his headline-grabbing lifestyle:'I won't cast a stone at (people) who 
have cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes or too much alcohol or those 
who fall asleep on their scooter: I am one of them, as you dear media 
outlets like so much to repeat.'

Back
in 1998, Depardieu also crashed his motorcycle when his blood-alcohol 
limit was five times over the legal limit, escaping with leg and face 
injuries.
