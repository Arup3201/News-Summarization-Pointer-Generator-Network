Young veterans are committing suicide at almost three times the rate of active-duty troops, according to data released by the Department of Veteran Affairs.

The number of men under the age of 30 committing suicide after leaving the military jumped by 44 per cent between 2009 and 2011.

The report found that the rate of suicide among female veteran had also increased, while the overall rate of suicide among all veterans was unchanged.

High suicide rate: The rate of suicide among young men who have left the military is alarmingly high

Two young vets commit suicide every day, and overall 22 former servicemen and women every day.

'Their rates are astronomically high and climbing,' Jan Kemp, VAâ€™s National Mental Health Director for Suicide Prevention and author of the report, told military publication Stars and Stripes. 'Thatâ€™s concerning to us.'

The Department can't pinpoint a reason for the increase, but Kemp said the pressures of leaving military careers, adjusting to civilian life, living with injuries sustained in combat and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder all play a part.

Suicide rates among vets enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Health (VHA) system who seek help are much more positive. There has been a decrease in rates among vets seeking care in the health system, and only five of the 22 daily suicides are in the system.

According to the report, the suicide rate among VHA male users decreased by 30 per cent, while rates increase 60 per cent among males not enrolled.

'Treatment does work,' said Kemp.

The difficulty lies in getting young veterans to seek care for mental health problems, which are highly stigmatized.

According to the data, the rates of female suicide reflect wider trends in suicide rates in women in the United States.

In the U.S., the female suicide rate increased 31.5 per cent - the same rate of increase among female VHA users.

Causes unknown: Officials say pre-existing problems, trauma suffered during combat, injuries, post-traumatic stress syndrome and readjusting to civilian live are all possible causes of the increase in suicide rates among young men

In 2011, veterans aged 18-24 committed suicide at a rate of 80 per 100,000. In the civilian population, the rate was about 20 per 100,000.

For active duty personnel, the suicide rate was about 22 per 100,000 during the 2009 to 2011 period.

At a conference on Monday, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki said his agency needs to do a better job understanding what led to each suicide.

He said that of the 30,000 suicides each year in America, about 20 per cent are committed by veterans, who make up about 10 per cent of the population.
