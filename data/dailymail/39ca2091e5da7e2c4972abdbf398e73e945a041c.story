Tensions between Japan and China threatened to boil over yesterday in a row over a group of disputed islands.

Around ten right-wing Japanese activists swam ashore the main island in the Senkaku archipelago and raised the national flag.

They carried out the stunt to call on China to give up its claim to the islands, which are under Japanese control.

Worrying: Tensions between Japan and China were close to boiling point this evening after a group of daredevil activists from Japan scrambled onto a disputed island and raised the Rising Sun flag

Protest: The activists hold up the national flag on Uotsuri island, one of the islands of Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, in the East China Sea

Controversial: After swimming ashore the protesters clambered onto rocks and raised the Japanese flag

Infuriated, Beijing issued an  immediate rebuke as thousands of Chinese took to the streets in cities across the country in protest at the stunt.

The uninhabited islands, which the Chinese call Diaoyu and Taiwan also lays a claim to, are hotly disputed because they lie close to rich gas fields and are situated in a vital shipping lane in the East China Sea.

The activists, who belong to a group whose name translates as ‘Hang in there, Japan’, travelled  to the islands with 150 other people in a flotilla, which had ostensibly set out to commemorate Japanese citizens who died nearby in World War II.

The pro-Japan activists arrived in the island chain at dawn today on a flotilla of boats carrying a total of 150 people.

Japanese coastguards, aware of the row that would follow if any of them landed on the islands, ordered them to sail away.

But a determined dozen strapped on life jackets and swam to the rocky shoreline of the main island, Uotsuri.

They said that not only would they raise the flag on the coastline rocks, they would sing Japan’s national anthem, have a fish meal, and then carry the flag to the island’s highest point, where it would be planted.

When news of the assault reached Beijing, the Chinese issued an immediate rebuke and more than 100 people gathered near the Japanese consulate in China’s southern city of Guanghzou, demanding the Japanese leave the islands.

Anger: When news of the assault reached Beijing, the Chinese issued an immediate rebuke. Protesters carried Chinese national flags at an anti-Japan protest in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong province

The Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency said anti-Japanese rallies were also held in Shenzhen, Qingdao and Harbin.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gan had warned even before the flotilla set out that ‘any unilateral action taken by Japan on the Diaoyu Islands is illegal and invalid.’

He added: ‘China has made solemn representations to Japan, demanding that it immediately cease actions harming China’s territorial sovereignty.’

The islands are important to Japan, China and Taiwan because they lie on a vital shipping lane, but more importantly they are surrounded by deposits of gas.

Officially, the Japanese flotilla set out to commemorate the Japanese who died near the islands in World War II, but diplomats in Tokyo and Beijing were convinced that was just a cover story.

The real reason for the landing, it was being widely accepted, was to counter a similar landing by Chinese activists last week. They had managed to get ashore, despite a Japanese coastguard vessel firing a water cannon at a boat carrying the group.

The Chinese activists were deported shortly after landing on the island – but it is believed it was their action that resulted in the pro-Japanese group arranging their own assault.

As the Japanese protest voyage was setting off, Mr Kenichi Kojima, a politician from Kanagawa, near Tokyo, said the trip was about who owned the archipelago.

‘I want to show the international community that these islands are ours. It is Japan’s future at stake.'
