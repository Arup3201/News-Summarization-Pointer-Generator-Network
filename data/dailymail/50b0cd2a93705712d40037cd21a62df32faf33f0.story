Ashley Judd, the gorgeous 42-year-old film star who toyed with a political second act for her public life, has announced that she will not run against Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for his seat in the US Congress.

Judd, who stars in the upcoming feature film Olympus Has Fallen, told supporters via Twitter on Wednesday afternoon that despite widespread speculation, she will not enter the Senate race in her childhood home state of Kentucky.

'Dear Friends,' she wrote in a series of tweets, 'Thank you for these months of remarkable support & encouragement, for your voices, exhortations, & prayers. I have decided.'

'After serious and thorough contemplation, I realize that my responsibilities & energy at this time need to be focused on my family. Regretfully, I am currently unable to consider a campaign for the Senate.'

Ashley Judd (L) will return to her Hollywood acting career without a detour into politics, she announced on Twitter. Judd has been a die-hard Democratic Party supporter, but a Republican consultant told MailOnline that her poll numbers against GOP Senator Mitch McConnell (R) were not promising enough to guarantee that the party would support her

Judd embraced Olympus Has Fallen co-star Gerard Butler at the film's premiere on March 18 in Los Angeles. She wore a Herve Leger cocktail dress featuring the 'bandage; fabric that has become the designer's signature - and a dramatically plunging neckline

'I have spoken to so many Kentuckians over these last few months who expressed their desire for a fighter for the people & new leader.

'While that won't be me at this time, I will continue to work as hard as I can to ensure the needs of Kentucky families are met by returning this Senate seat to whom it rightfully belongs: the people & their needs, dreams, and great potential.

'Thanks for even considering me as that person & know how much I love our Commonwealth. Thank you!'

Judd was widely rumored to be the Democratic Party's new Hollywood darling. She fueled the speculation herself recently, saying that she expected her mother, former country music star Naomi Judd, to convert her garage into a campaign office.

The Washington Post was first to report the news Wednesday, citing inside sources. Within ten minutes, Judd confirmed the report on Twitter, where 171,000 fans follow her.

Judd has been a stalwart Democratic Party supporter, publicly endorsing President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 and representing Tennessee at the party's 2012 national convention in Charlotte as the roll was called for votes to renominate him for the presidency.

But it was Kentucky, not Tennessee, that she reportedly wanted to represent in Washington, DC, bringing catcalls from Republicans who said she shouldn't represent the Bluegrass State while she was a Tennessee resident.

American Crossroads, a conservative political messaging group run by former George W. Bush Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, distributed a YouTube video showing Judd telling an audience that "Tennessee is home." 

Judd lives in Tennessee but made it known publicly that she rooted for Kentucky sports teams. She watched Kentucky play Vanderbilt during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game at the Southeastern Conference tournament in March. The tournament game was held in Nashville, Tennessee, near her home.

Sen. McConnell's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from MailOnline. But a Republican strategist close to Senate campaign politics said that Judd would have had a tough time even winning the Democratic nomination.

Alison Lundergan Grimes, the popular Democratic Kentucky Secretary of State, was thought to be a more viable candidate to challenge McConnell, the strategist said.

'Polls showed that Grimes matched up better against McConnell than Jud would have,' he told MailOnline, 'so Judd's handlers probably saw the writing on the wall. You can't win an election without money, even if your friends are in Hollywood. And the Democratic party wasn't likely to help her.'

Judd also risked becoming a distraction, given her copious nude appearances on screen.

The Daily Caller reported that MrSkin.com, the 'largest free nude celebrity movie archive,' has cataloged her history of flashing 'just about everything on-screen.'She showed full-frontal nudity, and her rear end, in 1996′s Norma Jean And Marilyn and 1999′s Eye of the Beholder. Fans saw Judd topless in the 1996 film Normal Life, and saw her both topless and bottomless in the 1999 feature Double Jeopardy.She also filmed a lesbian sex scene in 2002 for the Oscar-nominated movie Frida.
