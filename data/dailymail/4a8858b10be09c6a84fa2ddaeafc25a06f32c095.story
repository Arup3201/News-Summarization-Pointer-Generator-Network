The Morley Pedestrian Gate where 
Gutierrez was stopped is part of the larger Arizona/Mexico border which 
is one of the busiest border spots in the country.

In 2010, the Arizona border processed 6.8 million pedestrians.

Half
of all drugs seized and illegal immigrants apprehended entering the 
U.S. are seized or apprehended in Arizona, according to the Customs and 
Border Control website.

In
2009, in response to increased organized crime in the border region, 
the Alliance to Combat Transnational Threats (ACTT) was started as a 
collaboration between 60 federal, state, local and tribal agencies in 
Arizona and Mexico.

Four teenage girls had heroin strapped to their bodies and tucked under the waistbands of their underwear.

One 23-year-old woman covered up four pounds of heroin in her bra.

An 18-year-old tried concealing a pound of methamphetamines in his underwear.
