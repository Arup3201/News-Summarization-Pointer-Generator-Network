Chelsea have agreed a deal to sign 13-year-old French goalkeeper Nicolas Tie.

The youngster from FC Poitiers is already 6ft 1in tall and has been watched by Manchester City and Arsenal.

He is unable to sign terms for Chelsea until he is 16 years old in 2017 but will be allowed to visit their Cobham training complex in Surrey every holiday.

Chelsea already have Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech as options in goal but will add Nicolas Tie

Chelsea have only just brought in Courtois as their new No 1 but are already planning for the future

Tie was spotted by scout Guy Hillion who has helped Chelsea recruit Eden Hazard and Gael Kakuta.

The teenager is regarded as a prospect who could eventually rival and replace Thibaut Courtois, 22, who is establishing himself as No 1 ahead of Petr Cech.

Cech's future is uncertain with Roma and Real Madrid among those clubs showing an interest in him.

Both Cech and Courtois played in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Arsenal after the latter was taken off injured

Cech could make a move in January with Real Madrid and Roma both showing an interest in the keeper
