Newcastle have no plans to sell France international Moussa Sissoko this month. 

There have been enquiries from agents looking to broker deals for Paris Saint-Germain and Arsenal but it is understood no formal approaches have been made. 

Talks are ongoing over a new contract for the 25-year-old who is valued at around £20million.

The France international has been Newcastle's star player during an inconsistent season

Sissoko has been one of the leading lights for Newcastle during an inconsistent campaign that has left the club 10th going into the second half of the season.

Sissoko, who has made 23 appearances for the club this season, made his intention clear that he wanted to play Champions League football last month, while declaring he is happy at Newcastle.

'I have ambition. My goal is to play at the best clubs, playing the Champions League, win trophies, but today I am a Magpie and I am very happy,' Sissoko said in December.

Both PSG and Arsenal can offer European football to Sissoko but Newcastle are planning a new deal to keep the midfielder at the club.
