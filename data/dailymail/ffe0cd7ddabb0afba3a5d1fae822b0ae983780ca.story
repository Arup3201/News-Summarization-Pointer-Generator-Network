Goalie Rick DiPietro, who was under pressure for not living up to his 15-year, $67.5million contract with the New York Islanders, has clarified his recent comments on having suicidal thoughts.

The hockey player said in an interview Thursday that he thought about ‘driving my car into a tree – off the Throgs Neck Bridge. There’s been a lot of dark times.’

But he clarified later Thursday that he was only being facetious in making the suicide comment, and added: ‘There have been times that I have been depressed.’

Figure of speech: Rick DiPietro, pictured in 2011, said he was being facetious over his suicidal comments in a recent interview after being sent to a minor league team

Twist of fate: The 31-year-old goalie brought high hopes with him when signing on with the New York hockey team in 2006. But a string of injuries left him unable to play made fans begin to turn on him

The 31-year-old goalie brought high hopes with him when signing on with the New York hockey team in 2006. But a string of injuries left him unable to play made fans begin to turn on him.

He was also traded to the minor leagues of hockey to the Bridgeport Sound Tigers, signalling a cut in both pay and prestige.

DiPietro made the suicidal comments to News 12 Long Island. He explained to the New York Post that he was being facetious. ‘I was just trying to draw attention to how important my wife has been to me.’

He also said that he told the reporter that his wife had been incredibly supportive through his injuries and the harassment from so-called fans.

‘Obviously, it hasn’t been easy,’ he told the website.

His seemingly suicidal comments caused friends and family to become concerned over his safety.

Meaning: DiPietro said he was trying to show how much his wife has supported him through injuries and setbacks

They reached out through social media to voice their concern.

DiPietro said that he appreciates the outpouring of support, but felt bad to make them worry. ‘Never again,’ he told the Post. 

DiPietro receives $4.5million each year from his 15-year contract, regardless of whether or not he plays. He said he remains unsure about his future.

New York Islanders General Manager Garth Snow said in a statement that he was aware of DiPietro’s comments.  

He said: ‘We will handle them internally as we do with all player matters. This is an opportunity for Rick to play lots of games in Bridgeport.'
