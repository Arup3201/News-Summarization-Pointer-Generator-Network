The distraught friend of two passengers on board missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 has revealed his last chilling exchange with them before they boarded the plane.

The man, who did not give his name, told Channel News Asia he was also meant to be on the flight from Indonesia to Singapore but changed his booking just two weeks earlier.

‘I have two friends onboard and they went with five family members.

‘This morning before I went to pray, one of them called me and jokingly said: “See you in the new year and goodbye forever.” And now, there’s this bad news,’ he said.

The distraught friend of two passengers on board missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 broke down on TV

The devastated man broke down on live TV while waiting anxiously at Juanda International Airport in Surabaya, East Java, Indonesia, for any information about the plane.

AirAsia flight QZ8501 lost contact with air traffic control as it flew over Indonesia at about 6.17am local time, a short time after the pilot asked to deviate from the flight path due to 'bad weather'. 

The flight departed Surabaya, in Indonesia, on Sunday at 5.30am local time, and was scheduled to land at Changi Airport, in Singapore, at 8.30am (Singapore local time).

'I hope for a miracle and that God may save them all. I should have gone with them but I cancelled it two weeks ago as I had something to do,’ he told Channel News Asia.

Many family and friends have gathered at Juanda Airport  to learn about their loved ones onboard the missing flight.

AirAsia confirmed there were 155 passengers on board - including 138 adults, 16 children and one infant - and also stated there were two pilots, four flight attendants and one engineer on board. 

Nationalities of passengers and crew onboard are one Singaporean, one Malaysian, one British, one French, three South Koreans and 155 Indonesians. 

The scenes of anguish were reminiscent of those in March 2014, when Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 lost contact with air traffic control several hundred miles north of Singapore. No trace of the aircraft has been found. 

The pilot of QZ8501 has been named as Captain Iriyanto, while the co-pilot is believed to be Frenchman Remi Emmanual Plesel. A picture of Captain Iriyanto has been posted on social media by his daughter Angela Ranastianis and his nephew praised him as 'a very caring person'. 

The last communication between QZ8501's pilot and air traffic control was when he requested to increase his altitude to 34,000 feet due to bad weather
