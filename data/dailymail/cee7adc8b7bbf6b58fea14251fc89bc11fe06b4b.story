It seems not all eyes have been on the Olympic torch, with these runners passing on a lightsaber as their baton in relay of a different type.

Star Wars fanatics carried the lightsaber from Santa Monica to San Diego, America for the 100 mile ‘Course of the Force’ Star Wars-themed relay.

While the Olympic torch sailed down the River Thames today, the force was strong with Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Princess Leia as 400 runners took up the lightsaber for charity earlier this month.

Relay of a different kind: The Olympic torch has been travelling a long way, but these runners became Star Wars characters to make sure the lightsaber made it from Santa Monica to San Diego

Inspired by his own run in the Olympic torch relay in Atlanta in 1996, Peter Levin, the CEO of Nerdist Industries, arranged the event to raise money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Celebrities including Chuck star Zachary Levi, Smallville actor Michael Rosenbaum, Glee actor Vanessa Lengies and members of the LA Galaxy football team all handled the Jedi Knight weapon.

Event organiser Adam Harris said: ‘Everyone has applauded us for creating such a unique event to raise money for charity.

‘Star Wars fans love that we created an event to celebrate their love of the saga.

‘I am a casual fan that appreciates the movies and the huge following that has come from it. 

‘I quickly realised from the passionate fan base that my knowledge does not run as deep as some.’

Mr Levin decided to combine his passion for the Olympics and Star Wars after his son hit him on the head with a toy lightsaber.
