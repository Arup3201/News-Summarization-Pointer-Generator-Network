Voting UKIP could wipe thousands of pounds of house prices, the Tories have claimed ahead of Thursday’s crunch Rochester by-election. 

The warning, following claims house prices slumped in parts of east London after the BNP won a swathe of council seats, came as George Osborne led a last-ditch push for the Tories to cling on in the crucial contest.

The Chancellor was joined by Commons Leader William Hague campaigning in Kent in an attempt to hold back the rising Ukip tide ahead of Thursday's vote, triggered by the defection of Tory MP Mark Reckless.

With Ukip now almost certain to win the by-election, senior Conservatives are now focussed on trying to stop Nigel Farage's party from winning by more than 10 per cent.

Tories have claimed voters in the town are increasingly concerned that Rochester and Strood could be tainted by voting Ukip.

Charles Walker, the MP for Broxbourne, who was campaigning in the town this afternoon said: ‘The danger is if you vote Ukip, the value of your house will go down.’

Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst said the concern had been raised by voters. She told the Telegraph: ‘I have heard a few people say that to me, but I'm not getting into that.

But Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said: ‘It's an absurd utterance, from a candidate who fails to impress. The Tories' desperation has reached new levels. It's not going to impress anyone.’

Several Cabinet ministers and MPs are expected in the Rochester and Strood seat in the next three days in an attempt to prevent the second embarrassing defeat to Ukip.

Douglas Carswell became the first elected Ukip MP last month when he won the Clacton by-election he called after defecting from the Tories.

The Tories promised to 'throw the kitchen sink' at winning the seat, with David Cameron accusing Mr Reckless of betraying activists who worked to get his 'fat arse' on the Commons benches. 

But Ukip have remained ahead in the constituency ever since Mr Reckless announced he was switching parties on the eve of the Tory party conference.

Immigration and Europe have dominated the campaign, with Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst struggling to hold Ukip back.

Polls have put the Ukip lead on between nine and 15 points in recent weeks. Ukip insiders insist they have not predicted a 15 per cent victory, which they admit would be a 'big ask'.

But they are increasingly confident of a double-digit lead, which would make it harder for the Tories to win the seat back at next year's general election.Mr Osborne sought to put the emphasis on the economy and employment, with a visit to digger attachment firm Masterhitch.

During the tour, the Chancellor warned Britain is not immune to the problems facing the global economy, but insisted the Tories have a plan for the future.

He told reporters: 'You have to make a realistic assessment of the global economy today. We've discovered that Japan has gone into recession, Europe remains very weak, and although the British economy is performing well we're not immune to these things happening in the world.

'It's all the more reason why we've got to go on working through our long term economic plan and why it would be a complete disaster to divert from that plan, to borrow and spend more.

'That would put Britain in a place where many other countries find themselves today.

'People know that the deficit has come down by more than a third. And if we want to go on reducing our deficit, seeing jobs being created in our country.

'We have to go on working through the long term economic plan because with the red lights flashing that warning on the dashboard of the global economy we know we mustn't divert course.'

Mark Reckless is on course to become Ukip's second elected MP in Thursday's by-election, which was triggered by his defection from the Tories in September

Sir John Major yesterday claimed Ukip is 'profoundly un-British in every way'.

The former Conservative Prime Minister blasted the 'sheer nastiness' of Mr Farage's party and said it was 'anti-everything... anti-politics, anti-foreigner, anti-immigrant, anti-aid'. 

Sir John told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: 'I think many of the people who are voting for them are doing so out of frustration at the ongoing difficulties of the recession, the belief that they are losing out and falling behind. 

'That will fade away as the economy improves, and it is materially improving.'

In his strongly-worded attack he added: 'The policies of Ukip, the direction of Ukip, is, it seems to me, profoundly un-British in every way.

'They are anti-everything. They are anti-politics, they are anti-foreigner, they are anti-immigrant, they are anti-aid.

'I don't know what they are for, we know what they are against. That's the negativity of the four-ale bar, that's not the way to get into Parliament and not the way to run a country.

'So they may be elected because people are frustrated.'
