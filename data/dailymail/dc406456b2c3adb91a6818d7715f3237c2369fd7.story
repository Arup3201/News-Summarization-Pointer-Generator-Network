Too young: Emily Tran, 19, passed away on Monday from a suspected drug overdose after attending a music festival in southern California

An Anaheim, California teen died on Monday after possibly overdosing on drugs at an electronic music festival over the weekend.

The Los Angeles Coroner's Office identified the victim as 19-year-old Emily Tran, who tested positive for methamphetamine and ecstasy at the hospital before her death.

Tran was first admitted to the health tent at the HARD Summer music concert around 8:30pm on Sunday, the second day of the event which showcases electronic and hip-hop musicians at Whittier Narrows Regional Park in South Menlo.

Officials say Tran started having seizures and was taken to the Greater El Monte Community Hospital where she later passed away around 5:40am Monday morning.

An official cause of death has not yet been reported, as the coroner must first conduct toxicology tests which could take weeks.

Tran was the only fatality at the two-day festival, but someone did die of natural causes at the event last year.

The event's organizers confirmed Tran's death saying she 'had seizures' on Sunday 'and sadly passed away'.

'Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family and friends,' the statement added.

One part of the security included a place to anonymously dump narcotics before entering the event.

The concert was held on Saturday and Sunday and featured 75 hip-hop and electronic performers and was attended by more than 35,000 people.

There were a total of 140 arrests at this year's event, 20 of which were narcotics related. 

A YouCaring page has been set up to raise money in Emily's honor.
