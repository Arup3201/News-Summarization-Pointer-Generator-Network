An heir to the Rockefeller fortune claims that a Michigan man posing as a phony, Austrian prince stole an antique commode worth $80,000 from her late mother-in-law, and now she wants it back.

According to court filings from the Manhattan Surrogate's Court, 57-year-old Lisenne Rockefeller, the daughter-in-law of Barbara 'Bobo' Rockefeller, claims that a man who called himself 'Prince Josef von Habsburg-Lothringen of Austria' stole a 250-year-old Louis XV Ormolu-mounted Tulipwood, Kingwood and Marquetry Commode from Barbara Rockefeller's Manhattan apartment while he was living there in December of 2003.

The 'Austrian prince,' however, is actually Josef Meyers, and he's from Michigan. And he's not royalty - he's a convicted con-man with a lengthy criminal record.

Antique: This 18th Century Louis XV commode is worth an estimated $80,000

Ms. Rockefeller met 'Prince Josef' in December of 2003, and the two began spending 'a great deal of time together,' according to court document first obtained by the Daily News.

Shortly after meeting, 'Prince Josef' convinced Ms. Rockefeller to let him and a woman posing as his wife - as well as two children he claimed were his - live with her in her $25 million mansion on East 67th Street for several months.

While 'Prince Josef' was living with Ms. Rockefeller, Lisenne Rockefeller claims he began to isolate her from family and friends, and began taking control of her financial affairs.

After 'Prince Josef had moved in with his mother, Ms. Rockefeller's son, Winthrop, noticed that the commode she'd bought in 1964 was missing from the apartment - and had been replaced with a cheap knockoff.

'Prince Josef' explained the switcheroo by telling Winthrop that he'd moved the original commode into storage while the apartment was being painted.Â 

In 2005, Ms. Rockefeller was in failing health and her apartment became too much to manage. So Winthrop invited her to live with him and his family in Arkansas, an invitation she accepted.

Ms. Rockefeller never returned to New York and died in 2008. Winthrop died in 2006 of a blood disorder.

Lisenne Rockefeller says she spent years trying to track down 'Prince Josef,' and that she always expected that he'd return the commode. However, as she searched for the faux-prince, she discovered that he isn't who he said he was - he's not a prince, he's a convicted con-man.

Lisenne Rockefeller made her discovery in 2011, when the New Yorker ran a lengthy article revealing 'Prince Josef's' true identity.

At the time of the article, Josef Meyers was in prison serving a 3-to-15-year prison sentence for failing to pay $220,000 in child support to his actual wife, whom he left in the 1990s.

In a twist, the court filing claims, Meyers also has 'children who oddly shared the same names as his children in New York City.'

Shortly after discovering the true identity of the man who'd passed himself off as a prince to her elderly mother-in-law, Lisenne Rockefeller found the stolen commode in a catalog for a Sotheby's auction. She later learned that Meyers had sold the piece to an art dealer in London in 2009.

The art dealer later told the family that he thought he bought the commode at 'too good a price.'

Now, Lisenne Rockefeller wants it back.

"The Commode was highly cherished by (Barbara) during her lifetime and 
thus holds sentimental value to me and Winthrop's children, particularly
his older children who spent a great deal of time at (her) New York 
City residence," she said in an affidavit.

Sotheby's says it will hold the piece until the case is resolved.
