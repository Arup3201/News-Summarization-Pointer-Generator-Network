A law student’s future lay in ruins yesterday after he admitted sending racist messages on Twitter to former England footballer Stan Collymore.

Joshua Cryer, 21, was arrested after the Liverpool striker turned radio pundit contacted police in January.

Cryer, the son of a company  director, initially denied sending the messages on the social  networking site, claiming his account had been hacked into.

Foolish: Student Joshua Cryer, 21, sent former footballer Stan Collymore a series of racist tweets. He was spared jail this week after appearing at Newcastle Magistrates' Court

But he later admitted sending grossly offensive messages and yesterday was given a two-year community order.

The final-year student at Newcastle University’s acclaimed Law School was also told to carry out 240 hours of unpaid work.

He had sent the obscene messages to ‘get a rise’ out of the former striker, the court was told.

District judge Stephen Earl told Cryer: ‘There will be a dramatic effect on your job and your career. But you put yourself here and you have to man up to that reality.

‘I find it difficult to fathom what on earth you thought you were doing. It was stupid and you ought to have known better.’

Immature: Cryer told police he hoped to gain a reaction from Collymore, pictured, who is a broadcaster for talkSPORT and also campaigns against racism

The judge said he expected Cryer ‘to have put his education to better use’. One message from the student, who captains the law school’s football side Barca-Law-Na, read: ‘Has anyone ever called you Stan ****ymore.’

A second, also sent from user  @joshuacryer1, said: ‘Has anyone ever referred to you as semi pro as in a semi pro ****.’

Collymore, 40, who was capped three times for England and is now a talkSPORT presenter, re-tweeted the posts to his 230,000 followers.

He is said to have replied: ‘Not having this crap any more. Joshua, I see you’ve deleted your tweets. I haven’t. Not having it any more, it’s virtually every day now.

‘Two officers from Staffordshire Police have been and they have a statement and evidence.

‘In the process of reporting you to Newcastle Police for racist abuse, which is in contravention of UK law. See you in court.’

The ‘JoshuaCryer1’ account was deleted after the tweets were sent. Cryer’s name and mobile phone number were later posted on  football forums.

Veronica Jordan, prosecuting at Newcastle Crown Court, said the tweets were of a ‘racist nature’ and ‘repeated over a number of days’.

She added: ‘Cryer appeared to have been boastful, saying: “I have found a new hobby”.

‘He started to cover it up by making false claims that someone had hacked into his account. Once he was arrested, he made a full admission and appeared to be contrite.

‘There was an element of showing off, wanting a response from Mr Collymore to get him to reply.’

Held: Cryer was arrested in January after Collymore reported online abuse to Staffordshire Police

Cryer’s sentencing comes days after biology student Liam Stacey, 21, admitted writing racist tweets after Bolton star Fabrice Muamba, 23, collapsed during an FA Cup tie with heart failure.

Disgusted Twitter users, including Collymore, alerted police. The Swansea University student will be sentenced next week for inciting racial hatred.

The case comes as police in Strathclyde were investigating  racist Twitter messages sent to two black Rangers FC players.

And in November, two teenagers were bailed after Newcastle player Sammy Ameobi claimed he was the victim of racism on the site.

Collymore said he has repeatedly faced racist abuse on Twitter and called on the Government to make it clear what is legal.

‘Some people believe freedom of speech means you can say anything to anyone,’ he wrote. ‘You can’t.’
