Monaco have stepped up preparations for their all-important Champions League second leg clash against Arsenal by training in La Turbie. 

Leonardo Jardim and his coaching staff put Monaco's first team stars including  Ricardo Carvalho, Dimitar Berbatov and Geoffrey Kondogbia through their paces ahead of Tuesday's European showdown at Stade Louis II. 

Spirits in the Ligue 1 outfit's camp looked high as they were seen joking around and juggling the ball during the training session in front of a picturesque backdrop.

Monaco trio Kondogbia, Jeremy Toulalan and Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco are all major doubts for their side's match against Arsenal.

Jardim set his side up with with a starting back four of Layvin Kurzawa, Carvalho, Aymen Abdennour and Andrea Raggi during the session.

Meanwhile, Carvalho has warned his team-mates that Arsenal are capable of clawing back what is essentially a three-goal deficit.

The Ligue 1 outfit head into their second leg against Arsenal knowing their opponents have to score at least three goals at the Stade Louis II to have any chance of progressing to the next round of the Champions League.

However Carvalho believes his side must be extremely wary of the threat posed by Arsene Wenger's side. 

The former Chelsea defender, speaking to Perform, said: 'I don't know [if Arsenal underestimated Monaco]. I don't think so. 

'Sometimes that happens in football. Of course, for most people it was a surprise.

'Arsenal are a great team, but sometimes in football, it's true that it can happen. So it can happen with us at home, so we have to be ready to play well, because in football you can have that kind of surprise.'

The 36-year-old, who missed his side's 3-1 win against Arsenal through injury, also lavished praise on Wenger before stating his desire to feature in the second leg.

He added: 'Everyone respects the work he does, and in football those kind of games can happen.

'Everyone wants to play those kind of games. I have a lot of experience and fortunately I've played a lot of those games - semi-finals and finals, I played two finals. 

'In that moment, I was injured, but more important for me was to be pleased with my team doing a great job.'
