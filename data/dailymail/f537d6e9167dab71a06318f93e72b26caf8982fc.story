It could possibly be the first partnership in football history that has its own bloodline. 

James Rodriguez and Radamel Falcao would have no excuses for not forging a lethal partnership at international level for Colombia because their fathers were team-mates before they graced the world stage. 

As revealed by Old School Panini, the fathers of two of the most famous attackers in football right now played together for Deportes Tolima, a professional Colombian side.

Radamel Falcao started and scored for Manchester United in their 1-1 draw with Aston Villa on Saturday

It could explain why the pair link seamlessly when on the field for Colombia, or even with Monaco last season.

After becoming one of the stars of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Rodriguez left the French side to join Champions League winners Real Madrid, and he won the Club World Cup over the weekend.

And Falcao is at Manchester United on loan where, despite injury issues hampering the settling in process under Louis van Gaal, he scored an equaliser for his side in their 1-1 draw with Aston Villa on Saturday.
