Bank of England governor Mark Carney has turned his fire on City greed and the problem of growing inequality, calling for more to be done to clamp down on scandal-hit financial markets.

Mr Carney said globalisation had led to huge earnings that were ‘amplifying the rewards of the superstar’ – but  ‘disturbing evidence’ suggested social mobility was decreasing.

His remarks are likely to be seen as an attempt by the former Goldman Sachs banker to show he is not a cheerleader for the City, after a speech last year which was viewed as a departure from the scathing tone of his predecessor, Mervyn King.

Mr Carney also defended the Bank’s low interest rate policy, saying it stimulated jobs – though he admitted it had caused a redistribution of wealth that hit savers.

In his most outspoken remarks so far,  he said bankers operate in ‘a privileged heads-I-win-tails-you-lose bubble’.

He accused them of a ‘host of scandals’ including fixing interest rates, currency markets and the gold price. He said huge bonuses encourage bankers to take ‘too much risk’, adding: ‘When bankers become detached from end-users, their only reward becomes money.’

He said the system is ‘amplifying the rewards of the superstar and, though few of them would be inclined to admit it, the lucky’.

Mr Carney said banks in the UK and around the world are still ‘too big to fail’ – meaning taxpayers’ money must be used to prop them up in times of crisis.

The Canadian, who succeeded Lord King as governor last July, told the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism in London: ‘Perhaps the most severe blow to public trust was the revelation that there were scores of too-big-to-fail institutions operating at the heart of finance.

The speech will be seen as a move to distance himself from predecessor Mervyn King and the City

‘Bankers made enormous sums in the run-up to the crisis and were often well compensated after it hit. In turn, taxpayers picked up the tab for their failures.

‘That unjust sharing of risk and reward contributed directly to  inequality but – more importantly – has had a corrosive effect on the broader social fabric.’

He warned about ‘the growing exclusivity of capitalism’, claiming the ‘basic social contract’ is ‘breaking down’ as the rich prosper at the expense of the less well-off.

And he pointed to ‘disturbing evidence that equality of opportunity has fallen’, warning that the young could face a bleak future.

He said: ‘Social welfare systems 
designed and enjoyed by previous generations may prove, absent reform, 
unaffordable for future ones.’

In the wake of the financial crisis, the Bank of England was handed sweeping new powers over the financial system.

Banks have been fined billions for scandals including the fixing of the Libor interest rate and the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.

But no senior bankers have yet been prosecuted over scandals that took place after the global crash.

Mr Carney warned jailing bankers will not fix bad behaviour.

He said: ‘Merely prosecuting the guilty to the full extent of the law will not be sufficient to address the issues raised. Authorities and market  participants must act to recreate fair and effective markets.’

Critics claim it is business as usual in the City after Barclays hiked its bonus pool by 10 per cent to £2.4billion last month – despite a 32 per cent fall in profits.

The Prince of Wales told the conference of business leaders that capitalism must adopt a long-term outlook in order to protect the environment. He said: ‘Either we continue along the path we seem collectively determined to follow... or we can choose to act now.’
