A professional skier and parachuting enthusiast was killed in a freak skydiving accident in California earlier this week.

Timy Dutton - known in the skiing world as 'Timy Backflip' - and several friends attempted an advanced jump at the Parachute Center in Acampo using wing suits when something went horribly wrong.

The high performance suits allow those wearing them to fall at speeds faster than 100 miles per hour. Shortly after jumping from the plane, witnesses say 27-year-old Dutton collided with one of the other jumpers.

'The fellow [Dutton] ran into him, hit his head into his foot, evidently
 knocked him out, because there was no parachute deployment whatsoever,' Parachute Center owner Bill
 Dause told Fox40.com.

Dutton, the station reports, did not have an automatic parachute.

In addition to being a professional skier, Dutton became a fairly advanced skydiver.

According to the United States Parachute Association, in order to use a wing suit a jumper must have completed at least 200 jumps. According to Dause, both Dutton and his friends had completed at least 400 to 500 jumps.

Dutton is far from the first person to die in a skydiving accident at the Parachute Center - the owner tells the station that there have been 8 to 10 deaths at the drop zone since 1981.

The Parachute Center also is where an 80-year-old woman came close to death when her harness connecting her to her parachute came loose in mid-air.

Close call: In 2012, an 80-year-old woman slipped out of her harness in mid-air during a jump at the Parachute Center

Luckily, instructors were able to save the woman before she hit the ground.

The Parachute Center currently is facing fines for not passing Federal Aviation Administration safety inspections in both 2010 and 2011.

Dutton's friend suffered a broken leg and is expected to make a full recovery.
