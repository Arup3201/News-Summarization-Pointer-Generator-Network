A baby boy has become Britain's youngest ever burglary victim - after his own uncle stole £110 from the newborn to buy drugs.

Sam Harlow, 20, climbed through a window at his sister's house to swipe the cash belonging to her then 10-day-old baby son, which was kept in an envelope marked 'Alfie's Money'.

Alfie's mother Gemma Harlow - who had been planning to set up a savings account for her little boy - branded her brother 'despicable' as he was given an eight-month suspended jail sentence for the pre-planned burglary.

Victim: Gemma Harlow kept cash given as gifts to her baby son following his birth in an envelope marked 'Alfie's Money', which was stolen by the little boy's uncle, Sam Harlow

Harlow, of Exmouth, Devon, had spotted the envelope of cash while visiting his sister's house earlier on the same day, and unlocked a window so he could sneak back in and snatch it in the middle of the night.

He admitted burglary, theft and possession of cannabis at Exeter Crown Court where he was given an eight month suspended jail sentence and ordered to undertake drug rehabilitation and 150 hours of unpaid work.

The court heard Harlow - who has been disowned by his family - had used baby Alfie's money to buy drugs.

Speaking after the verdict, his 
sister Gemma, Alfie's mother, said: 'I don't know how anyone can steal 
from a baby. It is despicable and about as low as you can get.'

The 24-year-old told how her brother had come to her house on the day of the theft to drop off a prescription for her mother.

'During that time he unlocked the window by the front door,' she said.

'That is how he got back in later. He broke back in while we were still upstairs and I was in the process of feeding Alfie.'

Miss Harlow said the money had been given to Alfie in congratulations cards she was sent after giving birth.

'Most of it was given by my partner's grandparents and was to be used to start a savings account.

'My brother knew it was for Alfie and was not ours as it was in a special envelope,' she said.

Thief: Sam Harlow, 20, stole £110 from his newborn nephew, Alfie

Speaking from the dock Harlow told the judge: 'I have offered to pay back the money but my sister will not speak to me.'

Gemma
said her brother had previously lived with them for eight months but 
was kicked out she began to suspect he was stealing money.

'There is one thing stealing money off us but off my son is 
something completely different. He was ten days old. I can never forgive
my brother for this.

'I knew it was him straight away. He continually denied it to us until it came to court when he pleaded guilty.

'He got a suspended sentence but I thought he should have got sent down for what he did.'

Sentencing Harlow Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, said: 'This was a particularly mean offence committed to fund your drugs habit

'You had been at the house earlier at the same time you saw this money which had been given to the new born baby Alfie. You went away and came back in the middle of the night.

'That was a pretty mean and thoroughly disreputable thing to do,' the judge added.
