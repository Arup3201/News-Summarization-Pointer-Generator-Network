Tottenham returned for their first pre-season training session on Saturday as new boss Mauricio Pochettino got a first chance to work with his players.

With several members of the squad still away on international duty at the World Cup, the remainder were put through their paces by the former Southampton manager.

Although the likes of Hugo Lloris, Paulinho and Jan Vertonghen were still out in Brazil there were still some big names for Pochettino to have a look at, including record signing Erik Lamela.

The former Southampton and Espanyol manager had previously warned his new charges not worry despite having a reputation for enforcing double training sessions in pre-season.

Pochettino, who led Southampton to eighth place last season, will be expected to qualify for the Champions League with Spurs, who could only manage sixth under previous boss Tim Sherwood.

Depleted: The squad is still missing the likes of Hugo Lloris and Jan Vertonghen who are at the World Cup

He is the club's third manager in the last two seasons after they also got rid of Andre Villas-Boas last year.

The Argentinian moved to North London after 18 months at St Mary's, where he notably oversaw the development of young defenders Luke Shaw and Callum Chambers.
