Mrs Williams stepped in front of the car with her lollipop sign to take the impact and tried to push five children out of the way

A lollipop lady who used her body as a human shield to protect children from out of control car has branded the driver's punishment as pathetic after he was fined just £100.

Robert Bell, 62, drove at Karin Williams who used her body to save children as the car hurtled towards her.

Mrs Williams, 50, stepped in front of the car with her lollipop sign to take the impact and tried to push five children out of the way.

Bell, who was driving in a pair of flip flops, blamed a coughing fit for the accident outside the primary school in the village of Rhoose, near Cardiff.

But the retired computer consultant was found guilty of driving without due care and attention after a three-day hearing at Cardiff magistrates court.

District Judge Bodfan Jenkins told him: 'You were having a coughing fit and you did not deal with it properly as a driver ought to.

'You got your foot not where you intended on the brake but put it on the throttle.

'It was a misjudgement at low speed and a loss of control with horrendous consequences.

'This is a tragic case, more for those injured than yourself.

'The tragedy is something you will have to live with through a momentary lapse of concentration and misjudgement.'

But Mrs Williams has branded the punishment 'pathetic'. She told the Daily Mirror: 'I can't believe he has been fined only £100.

'After everything he has put me through and the children through, it is simply pathetic.'

Bell, of Fontygarry, Vale of Glamorgan, was fined £100 with a £20 victim surcharge and court costs of £1,130.

He had four points put on his licence.

Bell's fine was based on his pension of £110-a-week. The court heard there are civil proceedings pending over the incident.

Bell's black Audi A3 car flipped over on a bollard during the school run one morning last June.

Karin
 took the full force of the crash and was left with broken legs, elbow, 
shoulder and ribs in the crash outside the school gates.

Four girls and a boy under the age of ten were also injured along with three adults who were walking them to school.

The court heard his car sent young children 'cartwheeling through the air'.

Married mother-of-one Karin - a lollipop lady for ten years - told how she heard a 'revving noise' and saw Bell gripping the wheel with his eyes wide open seconds before the crash.

She said: 'I was at the crossing when all of a sudden I looked to my left and I saw a dark car coming towards me at speed.

'It was on the wrong side of the road and collided with a bollard. It was very close to me.

'I remember seeing the driver's eyes were wide open and gripping his hands tight on the steering wheel. It was all happening so fast.

'I was shouting something to warn the kids and moved in their direction out of instinct.

'The next thing I remember is being underneath the car and feeling a sharp pain.'

Karin spent ten weeks in hospital recovering from her injuries.

One
 girl aged ten spent three days on a life support machine and has 
undergone a series of operations. She still does not have use of her 
left arm.

Bell's lawyer David James told the court: 'This is something that has weighed heavily on his shoulders since it happened.'
