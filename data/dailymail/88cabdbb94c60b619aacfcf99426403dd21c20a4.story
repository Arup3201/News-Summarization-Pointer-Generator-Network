A father who was credited with helping to bring an end to last summer's riots accused a man of staring at his wife before punching him to the ground, a court has heard.

Tariq Jahan, 46, allegedly assaulted Sajjad Ali after the pair got into an argument outside Mr Ali's workplace in Factory Road, Handsworth, on July 6 last year.

Mr Ali told Birmingham Crown Court that Mr Jahan drove up to him in his car and said: 'Oi, why you staring at me?' before getting out, coming up to him and then accusing him of 'staring at my missus'.

Mr Ali, 34, alleges he was grabbed by the throat by the defendant, punched in the face and knocked to the floor, then kicked or punched while he was on the ground.

Jahan, who denies one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm, made an emotional appeal for peace just hours after the death of his 21-year-old son in Birmingham in August.

Haroon Jahan and brothers Shazad Ali, 30, and Abdul Musavir, 31, were struck by a car in the early hours of August 10 during disorder in the Winson Green area of Birmingham.

They were pronounced dead in hospital and hailed as heroes who died protecting homes and shops from looters.

Mr Jahan, of Winson Street, Winson Green, later made a heartfelt plea to crowds of youths gathered outside his home to end the disorder and 'go home'.

His personal call for calm was credited with helping to bring an end to the riots.

He subsequently received a Pride of Britain special recognition award for his compassion and dignity in the aftermath of his son's death.

Mr Ali said he had not been staring at Mr Jahan when he started beeping the horn of his white Mitsubishi car as he waited in the narrow road - with a woman in the passenger seat - for Mr Ali and his colleague in a work van to move so he could pass.

Mr Ali told the jury that Mr Jahan's manner was 'really aggressive' when he approached him and accused him of staring.

He said he thought the attack lasted five minutes or less but he did not know if a number of blows he received while he was on the floor were kicks or punches.

Mr Ali was taken to hospital by his manager and treated for two fractures to his jaw. He also lost two teeth and had bruises to the left temple area of his face.

Ali Naseem Bajwa, QC, defending Jahan, suggested to Mr Ali that he had been the aggressor in the incident after he became annoyed that Jahan was beeping his car horn to get him to move.

Jahan stopped his car and asked him if he was a Hindu, Pakistani, Sikh, Muslim or Iraqi and said a few words to him in Punjabi, Mr Bajwa told the court.

'Your response was to say: 'F*** off you grey-haired old fart. Why should I tell you? He got out of his car and asked you the same question. You responded by trying to head butt him.'

Mr Bajwa said the pair got into a scuffle before Mr Ali was punched once to the side of the jaw, which caused him to fall to his knees.

Mr Ali repeated: 'That's not true' when Mr Bajwa said the defendant did not lay one finger or foot on him while he was on his knees.

The incident was reported to police on July 6 and the white Mitsubishi traced to the home address of Mr Jahan two days later, when police arrested and questioned him.

The trial continues.
