The world’s third largest cruise ship has emerged from a dry dock in Germany less than three months before it is scheduled to dazzle holidaymakers for the first time.

Quantum of the Seas, a massive 4,180-passenger vessel that weighs 167,800 registered tonnes, is the first in a new class of ships for Royal Caribbean International.

The 18-deck ship boasts a number of exclusive amenities and firsts at sea, including an observation capsule that extends over the water, a skydiving simulator and the largest guest rooms of any Royal Caribbean vessel.

The giant ocean liner will sail from the Cape Liberty Cruise Port in Bayonne, New Jersey to the Caribbean during the 2014-15 season before it relocates to China

One of the principal features is the North Star, a jewel-shaped observation capsule attached to a mechanical arm that lifts its occupants 300 feet above sea level.

The passenger pod, similar to the capsules on the London Eye, offers 360-degree panoramic views of the ocean.

With an activity area known as SeaPlex, the ship will be an ideal option for parents who are looking to keep their children entertained.

SeaPlex is the biggest indoor active space at sea, complete with a flying trapeze, basketball court and three firsts for a cruise ship – bumper cars, roller skating and a food truck.

Two-night cruise packages are priced at about £500, while a 10-night excursion on the Quantum of the Seas will set you back about £1,400

In addition to a sky-diving simulator, there is a surf simulator, rock climbing wall and venues for live performances, including the musical Mamma Mia! and tribute bands.

Guests will have endless opportunities when their stomachs start to growl. Quantum of the Seas has 18 restaurants, including an Italian eatery from celebrity chef Jamie Oliver.

Passengers will retire to standard staterooms that are the most spacious and luxurious in Royal Caribbean’s fleet or extravagant suites that offer breath-taking sea views.

Two-storey loft suites come with a private balcony and windows that are double in height.

The jewel of the ship’s art collection is a 30-foot magenta polar bear on the exterior deck. The bear is made of 1,340 stainless steel triangles, weighing approximately eight tons.

Passengers can also marvel at a wall decorated with more than 200 stainless steel butterflies.

The massive ocean liner will set off on its maiden voyage, from Southampton to a port near New York, on 2 November.
