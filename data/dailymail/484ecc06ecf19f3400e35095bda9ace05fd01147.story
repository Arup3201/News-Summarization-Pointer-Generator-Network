It's cheap as chips - the chip shop that's on the market for just £9,000.

Brunshaw Fish and Chips, in Burnley, Lancashire, is one of the cheapest in Britain and the National Federation of Fish Friers say it's an 'absolute bargain' at the price.

They believe it could fetch almost twice the price - at least £16,000. But the owners want a quick sale following the death of their father.

Siblings Abigail Francoli, 30, and Ben Francioli, 28, who ran the shop together, began to have to take time out from running the business to care for their father Louis, 65, who fell seriously ill with cancer 18 months ago.

In February, Mrs Francoli put the shop on the market for £16,500 as a going concern.

Their mother Michaela, 59, also helped out with the shop while looking after her husband and working full-time.

When Louis died last month, the family were no longer able to keep running the shop and shut it for good.

They dropped the asking price to £9,000 in the hope of attracting a quick sale. For that price, the new owner gets all the kitchen and dining equipment needed to run the shop, salad bar and restaurant.

Mrs Francoli, who also runs a nursery in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, said: 'We built the shop up from the ground, turning it from an out-of-date chip shop to a thriving business and increasing the profit 400 per cent, turning over between £500 and £800 a week.

'We loved running it as a family. My dad did the accounts, mum helped out after work, and me and Ben ran the place.

'I'm really sad to have to give it up, but we just can't afford the time to run it any more. We'd love it to remain a fish and chip shop.'

Andrew Crook, treasurer of the National Federation of Fish Friers, said: 'Burnley's gone through a lot of changes, including the demographic no longer all being the usual fish and chip-eating people.

'But this is an absolute bargain and would be a brilliant start-up business for someone willing to put the time into making it successful again.'
