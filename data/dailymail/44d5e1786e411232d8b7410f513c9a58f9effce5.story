At the ready: Prince William may have to arrive by helicopter for the birth of his first child in London

Father-to-be Prince William may have to rush to hospital via helicopter for the arrival of his first child.

William, 30, will still be working as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley on Anglesey, when his wife the Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth in mid-July.

But sources have told MailOnline that she is particularly keen to have her family around her in the hospital.

Significantly, our sources strongly hinted that Kate's family – particularly her mother, Carole Middleton, and sister, Pippa - are likely to be present at the hospital during her labour.

Remarkably, this means that the Middleton family may learn the sex of the new-born future king or queen before even the present Queen herself.

William is also said to be determined to make it, following in the footsteps of his own father who broke royal tradition to be with his wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, for the birth of both their children.

Previous heirs have been born at home or Buckingham Palace.

As a result, plans are currently being formulated by palace aides to whisk him down to London by helicopter so he can be present at his son or daughter’s birth.

But as any new parent knows, babies have an uncanny knack of making an appearance at the most inconvenient times and the journey is likely to take several hours even with the help of a private aircraft.

‘He very much plans to be at the birth but between now and then will also be on and off duty in North Wales, meaning he might have to get there rather swiftly,’ said a source.

‘It could be by train or car if he is up in Anglesey but should a helicopter be available then that is also a strong possibility.’

How will he make it on time? Palace aides are putting plans in place to make sure Prince William gets to hospital for the birth of his first child

Helicopters aside, the future king is not expecting any special treatment and is due to take just two weeks’ statutory paternity leave – for which he will be paid £136.78 a week – before returning to his normal shift pattern.

His wife, however, will definitely not return with him to their home on Anglesey with the new baby.

A palace spokesman said today that there was ‘still some discussion’ about where Kate and their new-born will be based as a result.

But the Daily Mail has already revealed that she plans to move in with her parents at their £4.8 million Berkshire mansion for around six weeks after William returns to work as builders are still finishing their new apartment at Kensington Palace.

Details of the royal birth plans indicate that although they are a very modern royal couple in many ways, William and Kate are largely sticking to tradition when it comes to their first child.

Modern fathers: William, left, is likely to follow his father Prince Charles, right, who broke royal tradition to be with Princess Diana for the birth of their children

Like the late Princess Diana before her, Kate has chosen the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s where a natural birth, staying in a private suite, is likely to cost up to £10,000.

William became the first future monarch in history to be born in a hospital when he was delivered there on 21st June 1982, followed by his brother, Harry.

The Royal Household’s official Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Alan Farthing, the former fiancé of murdered television presenter Jill Dando, is by happy co-incidence a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s and will be assisting with the labour. He will be led by the Queen’s own Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Marcus Setchell.

It is understood that contingency plans have been put in place with other hospitals, such as the Royal Berkshire in Reading, in case the Duchess goes into labour when visiting her parents.

History: The new heir will arrive in the same hospital where Prince William was born to Prince Charles and Princess Diana in 1982

But a source told the Mail: 'As was 
demonstrated when the Duchess fell ill with a pregnancy-related sickness
last year while staying with her parents in Berkshire, she can she be 
whisked in a private car to central London within an hour.

'So it is very
unlikely she will give birth anywhere else than St Mary’s, quite 
frankly.'

While palace aides are keen to retain Kate’s 'dignity' as a woman in labour, they acknowledge the fact that social media such as Twitter will make it almost impossible to keep her admittance to hospital a secret unless she is smuggled in.

But although both Buckingham Palace and Clarence House have their own Twitter accounts on which details of royal events are frequently now broken, it will most definitely not be the preferred medium to announce the new royal baby.

Instead a formal notice on a piece of creamy A4 size Buckingham Palace-headed paper, signed by the medical staff who have assisted the Duchess, will be brought out of the Lindo’s front entrance by a press officer.

It will then be handed to a waiting driver and driven through the streets of London – escorted by police outriders - to the Privy Purse Door at the front of Buckingham Palace.

There it will then be placed on an easel, last used to announce Prince William’s birth, by the main gates in the palace forecourt.

This will signify to an eager public that a new royal baby has been born.

Same again: On June 22 1982 a sign on an easel was placed at the gates of Buckingham Palace announcing the birth, the previous day, of Prince William. The same will happen this year with his child

Joy: William, pictured with the Queen on Monday at the annual Garter Ceremony at Windsor Castle, will be with his wife for the birth, even if he is flown in by helicopter from his Welsh RAF station

Happy day: Kate's pregnancy came around 18 months after their wedding at Westminster Abbey on April 29 2011
