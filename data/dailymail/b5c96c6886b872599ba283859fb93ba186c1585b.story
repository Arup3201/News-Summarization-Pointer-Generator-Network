Gaffe: President Obama has been criticised after referring to the 'English' Embassy in Tehran when it is of course British

Just a few weeks ago, Barack Obama hailed the 'extraordinarily special relationship' between America and Britain.

But it is clearly one he doesn't know all that much about if his latest foreign policy gaffe is anything to go by.

The U.S. President has come under fire today after referring to the 'English' instead of the British Embassy in his condemnation of the violence that broke out at the building in Iran yesterday.

A frenzied mob of militant Iranian students ransacked the main embassy in Tehran and a smaller diplomatic compound in the city.

They lobbed petrol bombs, stole classified documents, torched the Union flag and even tore up a portrait of the Queen.

The rioters also chanted 'Death to England' and threw rocks. One man held up a Union flag with a skull and cross bones on it.

In an interview yesterday, Mr Obama said: 'All of us are deeply disturbed by the, err, crashing of, err, the English Embassy, err, the embassy of the United Kingdom.'

By calling it the 'embassy of the United Kingdom', he got it wrong a second time.

It appears there has never been an English Embassy, although there have been English ambassadors centuries ago.

Back in 1479, John Shirwood became the first permanent English ambassador when he took up residence in Rome.

 Gardiner, a blogger on The Foundry who led the criticism, said: 'In 
case the President is unaware, England forms part of Great Britain, 
which also includes Scotland and Wales, though not Northern Ireland, 
which is part of the United Kingdom.

'One can only imagine the kind of 
howls of derision that would greet any presidential contender if that 
kind of basic error were made before, say, the editorial board of the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

'It would be nice if the leader of the free world bothered to look at a map once in a while.'

William Hague today demanded the 
immediate closure of the Iranian Embassy in London and ordered all its 
staff to leave the country in retaliation for the attack on the embassy 
in Tehran.

The Foreign Secretary has given the Iranian diplomats just 48 hours to get out of the UK, he told the Commons today.

Mr Obama's outrage over the events in Tehran are welcome, but the blunder is sure to raise questions about his approach to the 'special relationship' which has been considerably downgraded since the days of Tony Blair and George W Bush.

It is not the first time Mr Obama has slipped up on his geography, either.

Just two weeks ago, he mistakenly referred to Hawaii, his birthplace, as being in Asia during a press conference on the island.

And he isn't alone among U.S. politicians in his geographical blunders.

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin once said the U.S. had to 'stand with our North Korean allies' when in fact she meant South Korea.

Former U.S. President George W Bush was also left red-faced when he referred to Africa as a nation rather than a continent.
