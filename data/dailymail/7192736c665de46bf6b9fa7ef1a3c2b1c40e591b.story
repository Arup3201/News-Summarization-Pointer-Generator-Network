A teenager cruelly banished to Siberia by her American mother for failing in school has escaped the frozen region to live in Morocco.

Sofia Petrova, 18, was duped into going to Russia and the hell of being abandoned by her mom to live with her biological father - whom she had just met and could only speak Russian.

But after descending into poverty, and allegedly being beaten, Sofia has escaped to live in Morocco with those she considers her true family.

Her mom's ex-boyfriend, who raised Sofia while she was growing up in Chantilly, Virginia, took pity on her and paid for flights so she could live with his family in Africa.

Farid Souliman, who lived with Sofia's mom Natalia Roberts for most of the girl's youth, helped Sofia get to Morocco where she now lives with his mother.

She has now taken on his surname and considers herself part of his family - especially her 'grandmother', who cares for her and is helping her blend into Moroccan society by learning French.

Sofia went from an ordinary, all-American girl to an outcast in Russia, where she lived until she was two.

She was banished back to Siberia with her father, Igor, for behaving badly back home. She had no idea the move, billed as a vacation, would become permanent until after she had landed.

While living in the remote city of Novosibirsk, Siberia, she had to work in a hostel as a teenager to make ends meet.

Her relationship with her biological father reached such depths that she considered taking her own life. She now also plans to write a book, laying bare all the details of her Russian exile and fractious family relationships.

Discussing the project, Sofia told The Siberian Times: 'There are many things that I never shared, and many secrets that I kept. All of this is going to be included in my book.

'It goes into details about my relationship with my mom, biological father, and men that have been in my life.

'People know my story, but they know only a little part of it.

'Writing a book has always been a dream of mine. And if you have a good story to tell, you might as well use it.'

Sofia was a 15-year-old freshman at Chantilly High School in Virginia in 2011 when she was suddenly packed off on what she was told would be a three-week trip to Siberia to meet her biological father for the first time.

But after arriving in the city of Novosibirsk to stay with a man she barely knew, her Soviet-born mom - now a US citizen - and stepfather back home in America told her she wouldn't be allowed home until she changed her ways.

Sofia, who was born in Siberia, has a Russian passport and no automatic right to live in the United States without her mother's consent. 

'Abusive': Sofia fled her life with her biological father Igor, who was unknown to her before the visit

Instead, her mother said she would have to stay there as 'punishment' for her unruly behavior, including flunking school, running away from home and stealing $1,000.

Despite having spent almost all her life in the US, Sofia was born in Siberia and only has a Russian passport, leaving her exiled and making any return to her home almost impossible.

When it emerged there was no return ticket, her story was told around the world.

Her friends in the U.S. supported her, saying her transgressions were no worse than many other teens.

Sofia pleaded with her mother - who used to be an assistant professor at the University of Delaware - but could not persuade her.

Details of Sofia's ordeal sparked protests and campaigns to have her sent back to US. It emerged her biological father, who spoke no English, was often drunk and she claimed he beat her.

Sofia had to flee the house and stay in a children's center, where she spiralled into depression and, faced with the possibility of a permanent stay in a grim orphanage, tried to take her own life.

Cold: Sofia found little to enjoy in Siberia, where she had a difficult relationship with her father, did not speak the language and had to work to sustain herself

Her book will detail the teen's pain and suffering as she struggled to cope with being abandoned and a life in a foreign country, where she could not speak the language.

It will also tell how she moved to a hostel where she lived and worked 60 hours a week, including nights, just to earn her keep and pay for her studies.

Sofia said she hoped the book will help others facing similar traumas in their lives.

She added: 'I have found some peace in my life and I really want to help other children do the same.

'I stand up for children's rights now - so many kids don~t have a voice and are scared to speak.

'I'm not. I get kicked down for it all the time, but it doesn't stop me. Adults hold most of the power, but they aren't always right.'

The book will also go into detail about the relationship Sofia had with the three father figures in her life: her Russian biological dad, her mother's new husband, and the man she grew up believing to be her dad.

Far, far away: Sofia, pictured above in her Siberian exile, begged her mother repeatedly to return - in vain

It was at the age of 13 that Sofia learned about her Russian birth father, and until then she believed her mother's then boyfriend, Farid Soulimani, was her dad.

In desperation, during her torment in Siberia, Sofia tracked down her 'father' Farid, who she had not seen in almost six years, through one of his friends, following the global publicity of her ordeal.

And while he still lived in the U.S., he arranged for her to take a month-long trip to Morocco to the sanctuary of his relatives, including the woman Sofia called her grandmother.

When she arrived back in Russia, she found she had lost her job and she broke up with her boyfriend, fast-tracking her decision to return to north Africa permanently.

Now 18 years old, she has moved to Casablanca and has decided to adopt the surname Soulimani She is now taking French classes in a bid to integrate into society.

'It's not a new family,' she said. 'I remember my grandma from when I was a little girl and she had come to visit. It was nice to see a familiar face.

'Everyone is just so loving here. It's nice to wake up every morning to hugs and kisses.

'Right now I am just focusing on my French classes and finally being able to relax.'

Sofia said she is in the process of getting her official documentation completed to allow her to stay in Morocco indefinitely, meaning she never has to return to Siberia.

And she says her Soviet-born mom  is no longer part of her life.

'Everything was horrible,' she said. 'I didn't have my things, a place to stay, or a job. It was a disaster. I called my dad and he bought me another ticket to Morocco.

'My mum and him had gone through a very bad break up so my communications with him had been completely cut off.

Desperate: Sofia sent this message to her college professor mother - but it did not persuade her

'But his friend got in contact with me and brought the two of us together. He expressed how hurt he was that we hadn't talked in so long, but I knew that he loved me so much.

'He's the only one that I call dad. It was such a relief to finally have my best friend back in my life.'

Sofia said she has not spoken to her mother 'for many months' and is not sure if she is even aware she has finally been able to leave her Siberian prison.

She said: 'She is no longer a part of my life, I've moved on.'

The teenager said she also had contact with her biological father in Berdsk, and revealed she had dropped plans to take legal action against him for beating her.

She said: 'I've no idea how he is, I don't talk to him. Right now I have no relationship with him, I have a dad already. I don't need two.'

Sofia said she is still desperate to return to the United States, where she has a sister, and is working with an immigration attorney on various options.

'I haven't given up hope,' she said. 'I would love to be able to rebuild a bond with my sister. I don't know if that would be possible but it's something that I dream of.'

Roberts could not be contacted to comment on her daughter's situation. But in a previous interview she said: 'Sending Sofia to her father, grandparents, uncle, aunt, and cousin was not an easy choice that we had to make - but it was the right choice.'
