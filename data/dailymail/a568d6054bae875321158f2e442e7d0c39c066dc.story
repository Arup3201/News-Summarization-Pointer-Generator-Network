A Florida man who told of how he managed to pry himself free from the clutches of a large bear after he was attacked in his front yard, has been found to be lying.

Josh Hennessy, 36, claimed he was sitting on a folding chair under an awning outside his father's trailer in the Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento on Thursday when he heard a rustling in the bushes and a bear chased him.

It has now emerged that the story about as real as Goldilocks and what happened to Mr Hennesey was that he chased the bear, tripped and then fell.

Josh tosh: Hennessy explained orignally during a TV interview how he managed to escape a bear that attacked him at the Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento

Hennessey suffered cuts and scrapes on his hand, arm, hip and leg, but this was from falling rather than being attacked by a bear

Photos of Josh Hennessy's 'injuries' were posted on Facebook by his wife Courtney Allstead-Hennessy

The attack would have been the second in Central Florida since December

Hennessy claims this to be a bite mark from the bear that attacked him. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission say that it's not true

'(I) kind of looked over (and) thought it was somebody walking through the yard (and) I just wanted to go over and see who it was real quick because I don't really like people in the yard.

'As soon as I got into the dark, he just came out at me.Â  It was a black bear, so I didn't see it until he was there.'

Hennessey said he wrestled the bear, which dragged him out into the street but neighbours poured doubt over his story from the moment he had spoken, and Florida Fish and Wildlife officials agree

'His injuries last night did not come from a bear...Mr. Hennessy saw a bear, chased it up the paved road, during the chase he fell in the road,' Greg Workman, Florida Fish and Wildlife spokesman, said.

Neighbors said they have seen the bear in the neighborhood and have never had any issues.

'It seems very minor to me,' said neighbor Joe Frost. 'Bears don't attack us, bears eat our trash.'

Neighbor Melody Beard didn't think anything of the bears in the neighborhood, either.

'We don't bother the bears and they don't bother us,' Beard said.

A brief examination of Mr Hennessey's wounds show that the grazes and cuts he received were consistent with tripping and falling rather than being chased by a grizzly bear.

His wife, Courtney Allstead-Hennessy, 33, posted photos of the injuries on her Facebook page although no reference has been made to the made to the fact that the story was not as dramatic as first portrayed.

Scene: Oak Springs Mobile Park in Sorrento, Florida

Hennessy says he was sitting on this porch when the bear appeared

'It's bull. It's phony. It's fake,' said Phillip Sulatycki, 36, who lives on the street behind Hennessy to the Orlando Sentinel.

'Anybody who has lived here in this park as long as I have, which is 15 years, knows the bears don't attack nobody. You drive up by them, they run. I literally come out my door at 1:30 in the morning to get in my car to go to work and, if the bear's sitting there, he's just looking at you. If he does anything, he just grunts.'

Ninety-nine percent of the conflicts reported in the last 32 years do not involve human contact, according to officials.

Josh Hennessy, 36, had only been living with his father for one month at the mobile home park before he chased a bear, tripped and fell - then lied about his encounter

There has been a spike in bear-nuisance complaints in Central Florida recently. Wildlife officials have asked to Florida state legislature for more money to tackle the problem.

Florida's bear hotline had 6,700 complaints in 2013, the most ever.

The majority of them came from Central Florida.

Bears have been spotted in or near Apopka, Lake Mary, Umatilla, DeLand and DeBary.

Shy by nature, they have become bolder in neighborhoods where they have found trash, pet food and birdseed to eat.
