A furious coalition row erupted last night, with the Liberal Democrats accusing Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove of 'lying' about a flagship policy to give children free school meals.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced £150million to to build and extend kitchens to cope with the expected demand for the scheme to give free hot lunches to every child under the age of seven.

But the Department for Education claims an £80million underspend in schools maintenance budget earmarked for the work does not exist, which the Lib Dems dismissed as 'b*******'.

Clash: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insists the free school meals will boost attainment but Education Secretary Michael Gove hoped to spend the money on more free schools

A total of 1.8million children in England in reception, year one and year two will benefit from the free school meals from next September

More than 1.8million children in reception, year one and year two will benefit in England will be given free school meals from next September, saving parents 
more than £430-a-year.

After many headteachers and 
governors warned they did not have kitchens and dining halls big enough 
to offer cooked meals for every child, £150million has been found for 
building work to expand.

Mr Clegg said £70million of this will be new money from the Treasury and around £80million will be from unspent DfE maintenance budgets.

Some £70million has come from the Treasury with £80million from unspent maintenance funds within the DfE.

But a DfE source said: 'There is no spare money in either the basic needs or maintenance budget to pay for Clegg's kitchens.'

It was suggested the money would be taken from funds used to provide extra school places.

But furious Lib Dems hit back, insisting the policy had been agreed by David Cameron and George Osborne, and Mr Gove's ministry should fall into line.

Senior Lib Dem source

'The DfE are talking b*******,' a senior Lib Dem source said.

'Gove and the DfE had their eye on the underspend for free schools... which I think explains the slight bitterness from the DfE in some of the briefing.

'What we are seeing from DfE is them going rogue. They are completely out of step.

'It is time for them to stop whining and get behind a policy that they are going to have to deliver. The DfE are lying if they say there is no money.

'The Deputy Prime Minister wants the DfE now to row back and get with the rest of the government in backing a popular, innovative and exciting policy.'

Downing Street then made clear that it was Tory Mr Gove's department that were out of line.

'The position is absolutely the one the DPM's office have set out,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said.

The
policy has also been criticised by some senior Liberal Democrats for 
offering free lunches to even the wealthiest parents of young 
schoolchildren, while denying up to poor families whose children are 
older.

The decision to spend £600million-a-year on the meals was first announced by Mr Clegg at his party conference in September.

Yesterday he revealed it is new money from the Treasury into the budget of the Department for Education.

Chancellor George Osborne will use tomorrow’s Autumn Statement to reveal how the money has been raised.

Mr Clegg said: ‘Early on I made it 
very clear that universal free school meals would be my personal 
priority in this Autumn Statement and I’m proud that we are now 
delivering it.

‘From the start of the next school year, every single infant school pupil will be able to sit to down to a free school lunch.’

He said the extra £1billion over two years will ‘ensure children get a healthy meal in the middle of the day’ and also make sure ‘that schools are not left out of pocket’.

He went on: ‘Every child deserves the best possible start in life, and at the same time we are doing all we can to help ease the pressure on household budgets.

‘This not only encourages positive eating habits and helps improve concentration and performance in the classroom, but this will also mean significant savings for families.

‘Providing universal free school meals will help give every child the future they deserve, building a stronger economy and a fairer society.’

Mr Clegg has previously boasted of securing the £600million to fund the policy in a deal which will see the Tories offer a £150 tax break to some married couples.

Where the idea of free school meals was piloted, pupils who had the hot lunch were found to be on average two months ahead of children who did not.

The Lib Dem leader insists the policy will increase attainment and make pupils healthier

The poorest children saw the biggest improvements in their academic achievements, with a 23 per cent increase in the number of children eating vegetables at lunch and an 18 per cent drop in those eating crisps.

Being given a free lunch also saw between three and five per cent more children reaching target levels in maths and English – more than the 3.6 per cent rise seen after the introduction of a compulsory literacy hour in 1998.

The current free school meals scheme for underprivileged children in England costs £428million every year.

A school food review by Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent, founders of the Leon restaurant chain, recommended that Government offer free meals to all primary school children.

Extending it to all pupils up to the age of 11 would cost £1billion; the entire education budget is £57.2billion.

Sir Nick Harvey, former Lib Dem defence minister, has repeatedly criticised the scheme for not being targeted at those most in need.

‘Some 1.2 million children living within the Government’s own definition of childhood poverty do not get a free school meal,’ he said recently.

‘Why do the Government consider it a higher priority to give free school meals to all five, six and seven-year-olds, 1.3 million of whom can perfectly well afford to pay?’
