'Marouane Fellaini is not a Manchester United player.' That much has been the perceived wisdom across the length and breadth of this country over the last 12 months. On the evidence of some truly wretched performances, nobody, in truth, can argue with that.

In the next couple of weeks, it is likely that Fellaini will exit stage left from the Theatre of Dreams and the curtain will come down on a traumatic year for the bushy-haired Belgian.

Sadly, though, this last performance became a dark pantomime and a cruel exhibit of the heartless nature of football supporters. On a night of mostly uninspiring football, it may only have been boredom. Maybe they thought it was funny.

When Marouane Fellaini came on with only 14 minutes to go, many were surprised. In truth, nobody really expected to see him again in the colours of Manchester United. There may not be another occasion, despite Tuesday evening's rather eccentric impact.

As Old Trafford's east stand emphatically mocked every Fellaini touch and tackle, the turf of this famous old stadium must have felt a lonely, old place. It was all very unnecessary and demonstrated the unease that lingers around this club despite the sacking of David Moyes.

It seems peculiar for supporters to turn against one of their own. Many United fans will argue that Fellaini is not one of theirs, instead part of the Everton enclave that arrived en-masse last summer. That is a little unfair, despite the limitations that were so visibly exposed last year.

The satirical fanzine Red Issue produced a back page in April with Fellaini mocked up as a toilet brush. It read: 'Flush a fortune down the pan with a Fellaini bog brush'. The nickname has stuck and on this August evening, the jeering was merciless.

A sledgehammer has been taken to Fellaini's reputation but he remains an effective player and he would be a fine signing for most Premier League sides. To his credit, he kept asking for the ball, kept challenging for headers and did not shirk the challenge.

The goal was a little bit slapstick, Fellaini nudging the goalkeeper and defender out of the way and as the pair tumbled over, he slotted the ball into the empty goal.

The celebrations were loud and long from the United players, with Adnan Januzaj, his Belgian compatriot racing over to jump on to his back. Louis van Gaal's players clearly did not approve of Fellaini's treatment, taking it as a collective affront.

With what may be transpire to be his last touch for this club, Fellaini had scored his very first goal in the very last minute. That, at least, is very much the sign of a Manchester United player. Sadly, it may all be too late.
