Ahmad Saiyer Naizmand pleaded guilty to unlawfully using travel documents issued to another person in court on Tuesday

He allegedly stole his brother's passport to travel to the Middle East and join the fight with Islamic State

Naizmand's own passport had been cancelled in 2013 due to security concerns, so on August 6 he purchased a plane ticket with his brother's documents and departed Sydney airport.

He told customs officials he was a law student travelling alone to see his uncle in Malaysia, but two days later authorities intercepted him  in Dubai.

The 19-year-old was arrested and accompanied back to Sydney where he was charged, and his undoing came when he filled in a returning passenger card with his real details and not the ones on his brother's passport.
