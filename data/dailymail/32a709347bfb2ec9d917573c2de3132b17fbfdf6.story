A former police inspector killed his wife and six-year-old daughter before stabbing himself with a kitchen knife a week after he being sacked from his force, an inquest was told today.

Toby Day, 37, strangled and stabbed wife Samantha, 38, and six-year-old daughter Genevieve before turning the knife on himself.

Day also attacked his two older children Kimberley, 16, and Adam, 14, with a knife at their home in Melton Mowbray last December.

Kimberley was stabbed in the neck but managed to escape and raise the alarm at her nearby school. Her younger brother was found in time and survived a stab wound to the chest.

Both children were at the hearing today, accompanied by members of their family.

The coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire Trevor Kirkman said: 'No one here or in the wider community could fail to have been touched by these tragic incidents.'

He recorded a verdict of unlawful killing for Samantha and Genevieve and one of dying at his own hands for Day.

The inquest was told that Day had appeared before a disciplinary panel and been dismissed from Leicestershire Police for misconduct a week before the attack on December 8 last year.

The nature of the misconduct was not 
revealed during the inquest but reports at the time said he had been 
sacked for misusing police systems and matters 'concerning honesty and 
integrity'.

Detective Inspector Matthew Healey, from Nottinghamshire Police, told the hearing that on the day of the attacks the couple had met nursery worker Samantha's parents for coffee before dropping their youngest child at school.

While they shopped, Day was told that newspapers had contacted Leicestershire Police asking for information about his dismissal.

Later that day, officers were called to the family home after Kimberley ran to Swallowdale School having been stabbed in the neck.

Raised the alarm: Oldest daughter Kimberley managed to escape to her nearby school and call the police, who set up a cordon around the family home and tried to negotiate with Day

Home: Day, Samantha and Genevieve were discovered in an upstairs bedroom at their house in Melton Mowbray. Teenage son Adam was found downstairs and survived his injuries

Misconduct: Hours before they died, Day had been told newspapers were asking about the reason for his dismissal from the police force - believed to be misconduct of misusing police systems and matters 'concerning honesty and integrity'

A police cordon was placed around the house as officers tried to negotiate with Day.

When armed police forced their way in about an hour after the alarm was raised they found Adam in the living room with a stab wound to the chest.

His mother and younger sister were found on a double bed in an upstairs bedroom.

The former inspector was found on the floor next to them, with a kitchen knife in his hand.

The inquest was told Samantha died from strangulation and stab wounds. She also had marks on her eye that Home Office pathologist Guy Rutty was caused by an 'initial assault' earlier in the day.

He said it was believed Samantha may have already died or been unconscious when she was stabbed four times.

Professor Rutty said Genevieve died from three stab wounds to the left hand side of her chest.

However, he added that ligature strangulation was a contributory factor.

After killing his wife and daughter, Day then stabbed himself six times in the chest.

The hearing heard how during a search of the property police found a second knife, with Samantha’s blood on it, in the dishwasher.

Genevieve and her older sister and brother were taken to Queen’s Medical Centre for treatment but the six-year-old was confirmed dead at the hospital.

Hospital: Kimberley, whose identity has been protected in the picture with her mother Samantha, spent ten days recovering in hospital, as did her brother Adam

The hearing heard no one else was arrested in connection with the deaths.

Summing up, the coroner said: 'To say the least - and this is a dramatic understatement - the evidence is very traumatic.

'It’s difficult for anyone dealing with it and it is almost unimaginable to think of the thoughts of the family who seek to come to terms with the events.

'It is a case that causes particular anguish because of the circumstances.'

Adam looked at the floor while Kimberley stared straight ahead as the coroner read out his verdict.

The coroner added to members of the family at the hearing: 'No-one affected by these events will ever forget what has happened but I hope you will be able to journey on with the help and support.'

Addressing Adam and Kimberley, he said: 'I hope in some way that hearing what happened at first hand will help you to move forward.

'It’s hard to imagine anything much more traumatic than this.'

Speaking after the verdict today, Canon Lee Francis Dehqani, the family’s parish priest and vicar of Oakham, said: 'It is now over 11 months since the tragic death of these parishioners. In all this time I have been conscious of the resilience of the family and their deep care for one another.'

He said the inquest is 'one more step' in their battle to come to terms with the deaths.

Deputy Chief Constable Simon Evans, of Leicestershire Police, said the deaths were 'truly tragic, in every sense of the word.'
