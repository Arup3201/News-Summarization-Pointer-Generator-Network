A beloved North Carolina news anchor revealed his ALS diagnosis Friday in an emotional on-air goodbye to viewers after nearly 40 years at the same station.

Larry Stogner signed off from WTVD Raleigh last week in a tearful farewell to the station and viewers he'd reported the for daily since 1976.

The shocking reveal came just five months after a seemingly healthy Stogner participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge, meant to benefit ALS--also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease--in a segment shown on the air.

'Little did I know': Stogner had only five months prior to his tearful goodbye participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge to support ALS research

'Some of you may remember me taking the ALS ice bucket challenge back in the summer,' said Stogner in a steady but labored voice.

'Little did I know, it was about to change my life. There is no cure. My career in broadcast journalism is coming to an end.'

Stogner began his tear-jerking goodbye, at least in part, as a means of explaining to viewers why his voice had recently started to sound different on the air.

'I am sure that in recent months, you’ve noticed a change in my voice, my speech slower. Many of you were kind enough to email me ideas about what it might be, or just to show concern, and I truly appreciate that,' he said.

'More personal': Stogner said he would be back in two weeks after vacationing with his wife to give a 'more personal' goodbye

Stogner signed off by saying he was going on vacation with his wife and would be back in a few weeks to offer his loyal viewers a 'more personal' goodbye.

The veteran newsman's legacy will be honored by his station with a week of special stories beginning February 2. 

Stogner will appear one final time on February 6.

Over the course of his illustrious career, Stogner has had the honor of interviewing such notables as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Hillary Clinton. 

In 2010, Stogner was inducted into the North Carolina Journalism Hall of Fame, joining such journalists as David Brinkley, Charles Kuralt and Charlie Rose.
