Who was the best centre half in the Premier League at the weekend? Obviously it was Michael Carrick.

And with England struggling to find a partner for Gary Cahill, the solution presents itself right in front of Roy Hodgson’s eyes.

Manchester United’s six-game winning streak has coincided with Carrick’s return, and while the finishing of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, along with the sometimes stunning goalkeeping of David de Gea, have all been crucial in United’s run of results, Carrick has been vital.

Michael Carrick has been impressive for Manchester United this season, sometimes at centre half

He is a calming influence on everyone around him, almost as if his team-mates can now relax and say: ‘It’s OK now, Michael is in the vicinity, we can just give it to him and we’ll be OK, we’ll keep possession.’

Few players have the spatial awareness and ability to know where everyone is on the pitch, and how much space they’re in. It seems to come naturally to Carrick.

While Louis van Gaal has every reason to curse his luck with injuries this season, he has been blessed with good fortune by the return of Carrick, and the revelation that he is actually one of the best centre halves at the club. I’m not sure the Dutchman was banking on that.

I’ve always been a massive fan but I thought his England chance had gone. And when I talk about his England chance, I mean Carrick being a regular in the national side. He has been criminally overlooked, and in my view England now owe it to Carrick to make him a regular, and in the immediate future, he can easily fill that troublesome second centre half role.

Some will only fancy him as one of three centre halves, but he’s so good I don’t see why he can’t be one of two.

And I think he will get the chance as well. This is what England coach and Carrick’s former team-mate Gary Neville told me about Carrick when I interviewed him recently: ‘The players that play with him love him, and Sir Alex Ferguson picked him in probably 95 per cent of games during the most successful period of Manchester United’s history. What he does isn’t wow, it’s largely unseen stuff, but a lot of midfielders don’t do it.’

At United he won five titles in his first seven years, played in three Champions League finals and won one of them.

Yet his international career never took off. He made his England debut in May 2001 in a 4-0 friendly win over Mexico at Derby County’s Pride Park. But from that game, all the way through to the end of the World Cup in South Africa in 2010, Carrick was never been an established regular in the England team.

Carrick has won 31 caps for England - but should have won far more

Carrick often found himself on the substitutes bench for England  

Players such as Jermaine Jenas were often picked for England ahead of Carrick

Between his debut and England’s 4-1 thrashing at the hands of Germany in 2010, Carrick played 22 times for England, 16 of those in friendlies, and in only 10 of his games did he complete a full 90 minutes.

The best moment Carrick had in an England shirt was controlling the midfield in a man of the match display in Berlin in November 2008. They beat Germany 2-1 that night. It was Carrick’s first international for over a year.

He won the Premier League title and the Champions League with United in 2007-08; also in that season he played just once for England, in a friendly. He was overlooked for crucial qualifiers in Russia and at home to Croatia – England lost both and didn’t make it to Euro 2008.

One of Carrick's best performances for England came in the 2-1 friendly win over Germany in 2008

The most remarkable fact about Carrick’s international career is that he didn’t play a meaningful, competitive game for England from October 2006 through to September 2012. That’s the period when he was helping Manchester United to domestic and European success.

So while successive England managers struggled with the tricky Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard dilemma, Gareth Barry and Scott Parker were golden boys for a while – even Jermaine Jenas played 21 times for England – the man trusted by Ferguson in Manchester United’s central midfield was repeatedly overlooked.

Heads gone for the managers who ignored him, and in particular Fabio Capello. A month after Carrick’s son was born, Capello took the midfielder to South Africa for the World Cup. England were an embarrassing shambles, couldn’t pass the ball to each other, yet Carrick spent no time on the field at all. Not one second. Worse than that, Capello didn’t even take him to one side to explain why.

So that’s why this player deserves his England chance, along with the fact he’s in brilliant form whether it’s at centre half or central midfield.

Carrick isn’t a player who has let England down, the truth is the other way round.
