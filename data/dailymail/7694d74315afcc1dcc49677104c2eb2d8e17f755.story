They may have been trying to give 
their newborn son a regal air – or  perhaps some proud parents just took
a fancy to Harry Judd in this year’s Strictly Come Dancing.

Either way, they have helped  Harry 
over- take Oliver as the most popular name for baby boys in Britain, 
propelling it to first from third.

Oliver lost the top spot only a year after it took the crown from Jack, which had held first place for 16 years.

Danielle Lloyd and fiancé Jamie called their second little boy, right, Harry. Their first son, now two, is named Archie - number 19 on the list

In the girls’ list, Olivia again stayed top, while Lily swapped with Sophie to climb to second place.

Tommy was the biggest climber among 
the boys’ names, leaping from 131st last year to 66th this time round, 
an improvement of 65 places, while Riley rose from 25th to enter the top
ten, in ninth place.

Jackson also made a huge jump,  
rising from 128th last year to 75th in  2011, as did Jenson, which went 
from 99th to 69th, presumably inspired by the  success of British 
Formula One ace  Jenson Button.

Among the girls’ names, Eliza made  
the biggest jump, going from 141st to 84th. Willow was also popular last
year, climbing 31 places from 108th to 77th.

Sofia rose from 78th to 53rd, while Julia, which has only been in the top 100 for five years, leapt 22 spots to 63rd.

The enormous popularity of the  
Twilight films has also propelled the names of its characters up the 
charts. Bella – played by Kristen Stewart – soared 27 places from 98th 
to 71st, while Esme climbed ten from 82nd to 72nd. Jacob went from 11th 
to sixth – perhaps a nod to the saga’s Jacob Black.

Abbey Clancy and husband Peter Crouch are not the only ones to call their baby Sophia - the name climbed 14 spots to 14th place this year

Less popular were Tia, Scarlett and Aimee, which all dropped out of the girls’ top 100, while Christopher, Ellis, Robert and Brandon disappeared from the boys’.

The list was compiled from a national survey of 434,756 babies born to members of the Bounty Parenting Club in 2011.

Lisa Penney, of Bounty.com, said: ‘Our records show that parents are continuing to be influenced by popular culture and celebrity fads.

‘Today’s baby name trends are changing more quickly and names that seem  relatively unusual and quirky can quickly become mainstream and common in  the classroom.

‘For example, ten years ago the name Ruby was relatively unheard of as a baby girl’s name, yet these days Ruby is  regularly ranked in the top ten.

‘Common baby naming tips often  warn against calling your baby something too trendy, unpronounceable or difficult to spell. But, in general whatever name you give your child they always grow up to make it their own.’
