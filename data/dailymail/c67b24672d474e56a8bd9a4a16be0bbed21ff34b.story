Sculptor Sir Anthony Caro has died at the age of 89. The artist, whose work has been shown around the world, died on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack.

Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota described him as ‘one of the outstanding sculptors of the past 50 years’.

Caro, who was born in Surrey,  studied sculpture in London and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s.

Oustanding: Sir Anthony Caro, the renowned sculptor, died yesterday after suffering a heart attack.

He made his name with a 1963 show at the Whitechapel Gallery and his distinctive work, often made of steel, has been on show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Tate Britain in London where his piece Early One Morning is on display.

He also taught at Saint Martin’s School of Art in London from 1953 to 1981 where his pupils included artistic duo Gilbert and
George.

A major exhibition of his work is on show in Venice at The Museo Correr. Caro married the painter Sheila Girling in 1949 and they had two sons, Tim and Paul, and three grandchildren
Barnabas, Benjamin and Emma.

Serota said: 'Anthony Caro was one of the outstanding sculptors of the past fifty years alongside David Smith, Eduardo Chillida, Donald Judd and Richard Serra. In the sixties he established a new language for sculpture in a series of elegant, arresting, abstract steel sculptures placed directly on the ground.

'His development of this vocabulary, building on the legacy of Picasso, but introducing brilliant colour and a refined use of shape and line, was enormously influential in Europe and America.

'Caro admired the sculpture of ancient cultures and Greece and from the eighties onwards produced a series of large scale abstract works that reflected a continuing interest in the human body, but also a growing fascination with architecture.

'Caro was a man of great humility and humanity whose abundant creativity, even as he approached the age of ninety, was still evident in the most recent work shown in exhibitions in Venice and London earlier this year.'
