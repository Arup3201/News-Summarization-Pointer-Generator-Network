A stunning jewellery collection that lay forgotten inside a locked attaché case for 70 years is set to fetch tens of thousands of pounds at auction on Wednesday.

The case was kept closed for seven decades in a house in the far north of Scotland, because the owner lost the key and assumed it contained only worthless old family documents.

But when it was forced open, it revealed thousands of pounds worth of diamond earrings, rings and collars, emeralds and other treasures which once belonged to the owner’s grandmother and two maiden aunts.

This attache case, which had been dismissed and left untouched for 70 years revealed a bounty of expensive jewellery when it was finally unlocked

A breathtaking diamond collar worth £4,000-6,000 was one of hte treasures found in the forgotten case

The 22 precious pieces will be sold at Bonhams’ Edinburgh auction room on Wednesday, when experts say they could far exceed their £55,000 pre-sale estimate.

The jewellery went on display today for the first time since the Second World War, ahead of the sale.

Clare Blatherwick, Bonhams’ Head of Jewellery in Scotland, said the items only came to light because the owner planned to throw the old crocodile-skin case out.

A bout of curiosity made her force the lock first.

Incredible pieces like this Enameled Necklace (estimated value £2-3,000) only came to light when the owners were about to throw the case out

The collection offers a snapshot of 19th century jewellery and design. This Lady's Diamond Fob watch is estimated at £300-£500

Among the valuable items she found were a pair of diamond single-stone earrings, weighing approximately seven carats, estimated to fetch £15,000-20,000; and a 19th century Indian enamelled necklace with a Footprint of Vishnu (Vishnupada) pendant, estimated at £2000-3000.

Other items included a French cameo brooch depicting Flora, the goddess of flowers sprinkling flowers over cherubs, estimated to make £700-900; and a variety of natural pearls, diamond necklaces and gem-set brooches.

Ms Blatherwick said: 'This has all the ingredients of a fairy story -- a locked case, a missing key and hidden treasure. 

'There were a lot of boxes of papers and it was assumed this was just another. It must have been a wonderful moment when the case was opened and the jewellery saw the light of day for the first time in 70 years.

Among the valuable items found were a pair of diamond single-stone earrings, weighing approximately seven carats, estimated to fetch £15,000-20,000

'When I saw the contents for myself it was a moment of real wonder.

'This story was quite unique to me. 

'We have had interest from all over the globe.'

Although the elderly seller wishes to remain anonymous, her grandmother was Austrian, which explains the presence of some Continental pieces in the collection, and her grandfather was a Scots officer in the Highland Light Infantry.

They met in Switzerland, were married and later travelled extensively.

Ms Blatherwick said the collection offered a snapshot of 19th century jewellery and design.

The collection spans a wide range of styles and gemstones, pearls and diamonds, some of which have Austro-Hungarian marks.

She added: 'It gave me a real sense of history -- none of this has been seen since the middle of the 20th century. 

'They are all very high quality and wonderful examples of their type. And because they have been in this protected environment for so long they are in absolutely super condition.

'Whoever buys these will really enjoy wearing them.'
