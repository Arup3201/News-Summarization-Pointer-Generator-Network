Labour’s local election results were described as worse than those achieved under Michael Foot in 1981 – two years before he led the party to a crushing general election defeat.

Ed Miliband insisted he was ‘pleased’ with the polls, which saw Labour win an additional 291 seats, reversing some of the losses made when the councils were last contested, under Gordon Brown in 2009.

However, experts noted that the figures did not represent the gains normally achieved by a party on the march to power.

Michael Foot led the Labour Party to a crushing defeat in 1983, after he had disappointing local election results

Labour gained control of just two councils: Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, which it lost in 2009. It failed to take back Lancashire and Staffordshire, which were also lost four years ago, or Cumbria, another key target.

There were few signs of a revival in the south of England. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the results were worse than those achieved in 1981, when Labour won Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lancashire, Staffordshire and Cumbria as it picked up almost 1,000 seats.

Its projected share of the vote was 41 per cent then, compared with 29 per cent this week.

Mr Gove said: ‘When Michael Foot was leader of the Opposition they won Staffordshire, Cumbria and Lancashire.

They are not winning them now.

Ed Miliband said he was 'pleased' with the polls, despite only gaining two councils

‘What is really striking is that people are not voting for Labour in anything like the numbers they need to be on course for government.’ A Labour source said it was ‘ludicrous’ to compare yesterday’s result with 1981, when the UK Independence Party was not a factor – but Labour’s grassroots found little to cheer. Mark Ferguson, editor of the LabourList website, said: ‘I can safely say that today’s results are not the boost that Ed Miliband hoped for.’

George Eaton, of New Statesman magazine,  agreed that the failure to reverse the losses of 2009 was deeply disappointing. ‘Labour needs to be performing much better if it’s to stand a chance of governing alone after 2015,’ he said.

John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, added: ‘The scale of progress, in truth, will disappoint the party. Labour’s share of the vote was up by 8 per cent on 2009, but still 5 per cent below the result in 2005 when they won the general election.’

Nevertheless, Mr Miliband said the party had performed well in spite of UKIP’s surge. ‘There are still lots of people saying: “Can anyone turn this country around?”’ he said. ‘I believe Labour can.’

The results come after a difficult month for Mr Miliband, whose poll lead over the Tories has halved amid public concern over his soft stance on key issues.

His opposition to the popular cap on benefits has been particularly controversial. Similarly, despite lobbying from senior figures including Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, the Labour leader is against a referendum on Europe – making the party’s disaffected voters a target for UKIP.

Labour insisted yesterday that it had done well in target seats such as Lincoln, Harlow, Stevenage, Loughborough, Crawley and Cannock Chase, crucial battlegrounds for the next election. A source said: ‘This shows we are well on the way to victory in 2015.’

Labour received an unexpected victory in Witney Central, the heart of Prime Minister David Cameron's constituency

Labour was also cheered by an unexpected victory in Witney Central, at the heart of David Cameron’s constituency, where a strong UKIP showing pushed the Conservatives into third.

Anti-Coalition sentiment also hurt the Liberal Democrats, who lost more than a quarter of their council seats. It suffered the worst losses of the three major parties and came seventh in the South Shields by-election.

Across the 34 councils holding local elections, the Lib Dems lost 124 seats and were left with 352 – a loss of 26 per cent. However, the party insisted it remains strong in the areas where it has MPs.

Nick Clegg’s party had hoped to make gains in areas such as the south-west where Tory support is flagging. However, it lost out to UKIP in Somerset, Devon, Hampshire and West Sussex. It did, however, make gains in Cumbria, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Shropshire.

Mr Clegg said: ‘Of course, it is not good to lose hard-working councillors, but the Liberal Democrats are on a journey.

‘We are on a journey from a party of protest to a party of government, and actually the pattern that has emerged shows that, where we have MPs, where we have Liberal Democrats out on the doorstep setting out our side to the story, communicating our message, we are holding our own and in some areas making gains.’
