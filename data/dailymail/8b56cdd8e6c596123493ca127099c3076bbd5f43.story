With paint peeling from the walls and doors left to rot, these eerie photographs provide a fascinating insight inside an abandoned mental hospital.

St John's Asylum in Lincolnshire was known for its electric shock treatment - and rife with stories about inmates committing suicide in their padded cells.

These pictures were captured by student Jonathon Tattersall, 22, after he visited the now-derelict hospital to get a closer look of what remained inside.

Eerie: St John's Asylum in Lincolnshire was known for its electric shock treatment - and was rife with stories about inmates committing suicide in their padded cells

Spooky beauty: These pictures were captured by student Jonathon Tattersall after he visited the now-derelict hospital to get a closer look of what remained inside

Left behind: Built in 1852, the grounds of St John's included a burial site for those patients who never made it out of their incarceration

Fascinating: Mr Tattersall, who meticulously photographed the site, said the spaces left behind at St John's are 'huge, amazing and unique'

Permanently closed: The complex of buildings were known by the final name of St John's Hospital until 1990. But the centre - made even more unsettling now with its peeling paint - was very much an asylum

Impressive sight: People are 'amazed by what's behind the closed doors of buildings they walk past daily', said Mr Tattersall

Falling apart: The series of buildings were erected more than 150 years ago, and has been derelict for almost a quarter of a century

From the outside: The hospital sits in 120 acres of gardens and farmland. It sounds idyllic but - for its residents - the truth was often a lot more painful

He said: ‘A once busy hospital has now
 fallen silent and empty. The spaces that are left behind are huge, 
amazing and unique - hidden away.

‘Every
 derelict place I visit has its own uniqueness and atmosphere which you 
can sense when walking around. I try to give off that feeling in my 
images.

‘The people I show are amazed by what's behind the closed doors of buildings they walk past daily whilst on their travels.’

Built in 1852, the grounds of St John's Asylum had their own burial site for those who never escaped from the building.

Mr Tattersall added: ‘I also like to try and convey the sadness of the stunning architecture left to ruin.

If walls could talk: Administration of the hospital passed to the NHS in 1948 and, by the early 1960s, the name 'asylum' had been sanitised from its title. But there is a haunting sense of history when visiting the site

Overgrown: Mr Tattersall captured some extraordinary photographs, saying that the 'once-busy hospital has now fallen silent and empty'

Butterflies and flowers: With paint peeling from the walls and doors left to rot, this photograph provides a poignant image of at least a superficial attempt to brighten patients' days

Open doors: Mr Tattersall said he attempts in his work to 'convey the sadness of the stunning architecture left to ruin'

Beyond redemption: The St John's sight is now a sorry sight, and there are now firm plans to bring the buildings back to their former glory

Unique architecture: Even though the buildings are in a sad state of disrepair, Tattersall said they were still more impressive than the 'bland and horrible modern architecture appearing in towns and cities'

Escape... but no escape: Fire exit doors, in various states of decay, would have provided patients with a temporary respite from the asylum - and only in an emergency

Metaphor: The soothing floral-pattern wallpaper in this room has peeled away to reveal the impenetrable brick wall behind

‘This is especially important to capture as nowadays you have bland and horrible modern architecture appearing in towns and cities.

‘The buildings built in the previous century are a thing of the past.’

The hospital has been derelict since 1990 and was set in grounds of 120 acres of gardens and farmland.

Administration of the hospital passed to the NHS in 1948 and by the early 1960s it was known by its final name of St John's Hospital.

A plan to transform the hospital into more than 200 homes was approved by the local council in North Kesteven in April.

Property development firm Mabec hopes to turn the Grade II-listed building into 64 houses and 42 apartments, according to reports.

A large number of asylums were built across Britain in the second half of 19th century to house the mentally ill in Victorian society.

Doctors believed that mental health issues were primarily a physical disorder of the brain - and therefore needed physical treatment.

One of their treatments at that time involved giving the patient a shock from a Leydan jar - a device for storing electric charge.

Another method was said to have been insulating the patient, electrifying them and then drawing sparks from the affected part.

One doctor from the Sussex Asylum wrote in 1873 of a 26-year-old female patient with melancholia who 'endeavoured in every way to destroy herself'.

According to an article in the British Journal of Psychiatry in 1988, Dr Newth said: 'Electricity was applied 26 times, positive pole to bead, negative to band. At first, she could only bear a very few cells, six or eight, and it seemed to make her head ache - however, she was afterwards able to bear more.

He added that the results were ‘very satisfactory’, saying that she was ‘much brighter, converses rationally' and 'has no desire for self-destruction’.
