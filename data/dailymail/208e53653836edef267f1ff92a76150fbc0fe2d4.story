Eppie Sprung Dawson drove the teenager into the countryside where she had sex with him

A shamed teacher who was caught in a car with a 17-year-old pupil yesterday admitted that she had sex with the youth.

A court heard how Eppie Sprung Dawson, 26, had agreed to give the dyslexic teenager extra help with his lessons at the Catholic secondary where she worked.

But the married English teacher, who was only four years into her career, drove him to the countryside, stopped in a lay-by and had sex with him.

They were spotted together by police officers on a routine patrol.

At Dumfries Sheriff Court yesterday, Dawson admitted that on December 21, while she was in a position of trust, she engaged in sexual activities with, or directed towards, a person under the age of 18, and that she had sexual intercourse with him.

Procurator fiscal depute Lyndsay Hunter said that Dawson had met the youth in Dumfries and then drove him to a lay-by on the Cummertrees to Hoddam Road.

She said that at around 5.20pm, police noticed the car, which had condensation on its windows.

The fiscal added: ‘The officers remained in their vehicle and spotted the couple in the passenger seat of the car. 

‘They left their vehicle and approached the parked car where they saw the couple having sexual intercourse.

Dawson admitted that while she was in a position of trust as a teacher she had sex with one of her pupils

'The police officers knocked on the car door and then saw the accused and a male, both naked from the waist down.’ 

Mrs Hunter said that Dawson was spoken to and it became clear that she was a teacher.

The fiscal added that she made no reply when  cautioned and charged.

Sheriff George Jamieson deferred sentence until May 1 and called for reports, including a psychiatric assessment. 

Dawson, of Dumfries, who taught at the town’s St Joseph’s College, was placed on the sex offenders’ register. 

Responsibility: Dawson taught at St Joseph's College and was four years into her career

Sheriff Jamieson said the length of time she would remain on the register would be decided when she was sentenced. Bail was continued.

Solicitor David Finnie, defending, told the court that he would reserve his plea in mitigation until reports were prepared.

When Dawson was originally charged in January, one former pupil said that she often sent text messages signed off with kisses and claimed that she was known for being ‘touchy-feely’.

Yesterday, a spokesman for  Dumfries and
Galloway Council said Dawson was no longer employed by the authority 
and it would therefore not be appropriate to comment on the case.

Last night, there was no answer at the house that Dawson had shared with her husband Ranald, 32 – the son of the former Solicitor General for Scotland, Lord Dawson.

The teenager’s family could not be contacted for comment last night but when details of the case originally emerged, a woman at the family home said: ‘He is the victim in this but I don’t want to talk about it.’ 

A spokesman for the General Teaching Council for Scotland  said: ‘We are aware of this case and conducting our own investigations into this matter.’
