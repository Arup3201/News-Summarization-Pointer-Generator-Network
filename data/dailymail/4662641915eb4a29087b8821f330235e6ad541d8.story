A 'highly decorated' soldier used compensation he received from the army to set up an illegal payday loans business and threatened junior comrades with punishment duty if they failed to pay him back, a court has heard.

Afghanistan veteran Lance Corporal Charles Trouliotis is accused of handing out £31,000 worth of loans to more than 30 subordinate soldiers in the Princess of Wales Royal Regiment, charging them 40 per cent interest.

The 25-year-old is said to have bankrolled his money-lending business after receiving a cash settlement from the army compensation fund due to an injury sustained playing football.

He has admitted lending money to fellow soldiers and family members but insists he did not charge interest and only made a profit because people paid him gifts as a thank you.

Trouliotis is on trial at Woolwich Crown Court alongside his best friend in the regiment Corporal David Couch, 28, of The Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich, south east London, who is accused of helping him run the enterprise.

Stuart Jessop, prosecuting, told the court that father-of-one Trouliotis charged interest rates of up to 40 per cent on loans to his fellow soldiers.

Mr Jessop said that he used his senior rank to bully and threaten his subordinates to pay back 'exorbitant' amounts of interest.

He explained: 'There’s no doubt that you were a first class soldier and a brave soldier. You were highly decorated.

'But you were running an illegal money lending business for profit.

'You used the fact that you were respected and well liked to help you with this money lending business.'

One private gave evidence to say that an initial loan of £400 spiralled into a £1,800 debt and he was threatened with punishment duty if he failed to pay.

Mr Jessop added: 'He was struggling to pay you back because you were charging exorbitant interest.

'You would say "where’s my f***ing money you will go on standby if you don’t pay this money.”'

The two men are said to have operated an unlicensed credit business at the Royal Artillery Barracks, Woolwich (pictured)

Standby is an army punishment where superiors order someone to do unwanted jobs.

But Trouliotis insisted he was just helping out his colleagues.

He said: 'They are my friends. That’s what you do for friends. You help them out.'

Trouliotis also told the court how he gave money to around 30 people in his regiment, mostly lower-ranking soldiers, but some were full corporals senior to him.

He added: 'Over half of those I lent money to offered more money back.

'If they were happy to pay a little extra I would say thank you very much.'

But Mr Jessop said that texts from Trouliotis to his debtors showed there was an 'awful lot of palaver and aggravation' chasing them for money.

Trouliotis is also accused of profiting off money lent to his family, including a cousin called Little Roy.

A text message, from Trouliotis to his wife, said: 'If Little Roy doesn’t pay me by Friday I’m going to his house this weekend and I’m going to smash him in.'

But the soldier, of Victoria, London, told the court: 'I would never hurt anyone. It’s not in my nature.'

Trouliotis also told the court he would lend Couch money because the superior non-commissioned officer would often be skint because he was addicted to gambling.

But the prosecution said that Couch also delivered loans on behalf of Trouliotis and texts between them showed they were working together to get repayments.

After a private who allegedly owed money to Trouliotis complained to a senior officer, Trouliotis texted Couch: 'If he grasses again, me and you could be goners.'

The court was also told that Trouliotis had nine bank accounts which he regularly moved money between and he also transferred more than £3,400 to his co-defendant Couch.  

Barrister Mr Jessop asked: 'Does it reflect the fact you were operating together and were lending?'

Trouliotis denied the accusation, but admitted having nine different bank accounts which he regularly shuffled funds between.

He claimed one was an old account, but the other eight were due to a hard-pushing bank sales manager.

The former soldier said: 'When I was in the bank, the advisor doing his job tried to sell the other accounts to me. And I thought 'why not?'"

One was a shared account with a friend.

Trouliotis added: 'We had a dream of buying a house together but we worked out we couldn't really afford it. It was a silly drunken conversation.

Texts were also read to the jury sent from Trouliotis' phone to the co-accused Couch.

It read: "You realise the palaver you have caused us with your shit money lending skills.' 

But when asked if he sent the text, he said: 'I never sent the message.'

Mr Jessop questioned Trouliotis about his finances, because in the 18 months he is accused of running the lending business, he was paid £30,000 in wages, yet spent more than £46,000 in direct debits and standing orders - and withdrew more than £14,000 in cash.

Trouliotis said: 'I had an £18,000 compensation claim and worked for my uncle as well.

'I was getting married and if I was to buy something, the wedding dress for example, I would be reimbursed.' 

Trouliotis, who is no longer a soldier, was arrested in an early morning raid at his home in May.

Both men, who appeared before the judge in navy and yellow regimental ties, deny two counts of running an unlicensed credit firm and one count of money laundering between January 2012 and May 2013.

They also deny one count of concealing, disguising, converting, transferring or removing criminal property, and a money laundering offence under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

The trial continues.
