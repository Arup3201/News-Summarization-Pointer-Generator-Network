Andrea Fernandez developed a clot in her leg known as Deep Vein ThrobosiS

Each year, one in every 1,000 Britons develops deep vein thrombosis - a blood clot in a large vein. This can cause permanent vein damage, raising the risk of further clots. Andrea Fernandez, 25, a communications assistant from Brixton, South London, was the first person in the world to undergo a new treatment to reduce the symptoms and prevent a second DVT, as she tells SOPHIE GOODCHILD.

Lying on the sofa one night, I suddenly felt intense pain in my groin. I thought it was due to the position I'd been in, so didn't think anything more of it, and went to bed.

When I woke up the next morning, the pain was worse and had spread down my right leg. I was in agony and my leg was red and swollen to twice its size. I could barely walk and couldn't bend my knee.

I managed to take myself to hospital, where doctors found I had a deep vein thrombosis in my groin. Part of the clot had broken off and gone to my lung.

It turned out I have a genetic condition which means I don't make enough of the protein that prevents clots forming. My mum and sister have since been tested, and they also have the condition.I spent a week in hospital. I was given painkillers and the blood-thinning drug acenocoumarol. The doctors prescribed compression stockings for the swelling.

This was three years ago, and since then the DVT has really impacted my life. My leg would get swollen and red in hot weather, or if I'd been standing for a while. I had to monitor my diet, as high levels of vitamin K - found in leafy green vegetables and some cereals - can stop the medication working properly. I had to avoid alcohol for the same reason.

I needed monthly tests to check my blood for clots and doctors adjusted my dose of medication often. Then aged 22, I found the compression stockings a hassle. They were hard to put on and could get uncomfortable. I had to wear them all the time - and they're not the sort of thing you want to wear with a short skirt.

Last year, I found a pea-sized lump in my right groin. It wasn't painful and I could only feel it when standing, so I didn't panic. After a month, I saw my GP for my regular check. He referred me to St  George's Hospital to make sure the lump wasn't a hernia. A scan revealed it was a varicose vein. Because the clot left my veins badly damaged and scarred, blood was not moving properly through my leg, causing a vein to bulge out under the skin, as too much blood was collecting in it. And there was a risk of another clot.

I first saw Mr Stephen Black, a consultant vascular surgeon at the hospital, last November. He told me about a new treatment using a tiny mesh tube that holds damaged veins open to allow blood to flow normally. This would reduce the risk of clots and mean no more swelling, pain or compression stockings. The operation would take only an hour and a half.

Andrea had a pioneering new procedure using a tiny mesh tube that holds damaged veins open

I had the operation in January this year. I stayed in hospital for a night, and the next day I could almost walk normally.

One
 month on, I don't have any pain. I still have to take medication, 
because of my genetic condition, but I'm now on a new blood-thinning 
drug called rivaroxaban. Before, I needed to take different doses on 
different days, but this was one daily pill.

In a couple of months, I won't need compression stockings and my leg should be back to the size it was before the DVT.

Stephen Black is a consultant vascular surgeon at St George's Hospital in Tooting, South London.DVT is a blood clot that develops in a large vein, usually in the leg. Normally, blood flows quickly through veins, but factors such as being inactive can slow down this flow and trigger clots.

Patients who have recently undergone surgery are particularly at risk. About a third develop a clot extending from lower in the leg to the upper thigh or groin.

Andrea's clot extended from her knee into her pelvis. The higher the clot, the greater the risk of a bit breaking off and travelling to the lungs. Called a pulmonary embolism, this may be fatal in around one in ten people. Untreated, it can cause cardiac arrest, as the lung clot can cut off blood flow to the heart.

Another issue is the clot remaining in
 a vein for too long. The blockage can damage the vein, creating scar 
tissue, which restricts blood flow.

Blood-thinning
 drugs such as warfarin are common treatments. But these don't dissolve 
the clot, they thin the blood and prevent further clots.

Doctors
 can try to break up the clot with special clot-busting drugs. However, 
these increase the risk of internal bleeding, so are only used in 
chronic cases.

Doctors have also tried using stents in patients with DVT. Stents are tiny cylindrical mesh tubes that act like scaffolding, widening a damaged blood vessel so blood can flow normally. while the stent doesn't remove the clot, it reduces the risk of a new DVT.

But the success of stents in veins has been variable, as previously they've only been designed for arteries. Veins are larger and more powerful, so the stent becomes blocked or crushed.

However, a stronger stent has been developed in the U.S. for veins. I set up a programme at St  George's, helped by Professor Peter Neglen, a stent pioneer who is retired but is chair of the European Venous Forum. The treatment is a team effort.

One month on, she has no pain

Andrea was the first patient to be treated with this new stent. Called the Veniti Vici Venous Stent, it has the same strength end-to-end, so is crush-resistant. It's made from nitinol - nickel and titanium - which is more flexible than other metals.

Kept cold outside of the body, it can be compressed to a very small size, meaning we can make a smaller incision to place it. Once inserted, it expands and reaches full strength at body temperature. It is also slightly larger than a normal stent.

Stent treatment is not suitable for patients with clots lower down the leg, as the veins are too small.

This new stent is remarkably 
effective. Long-term studies in the U.S. suggest nearly three-quarters 
of patients will be pain-free, and around half will no longer have 
swelling. The stents work in 90 per cent of cases.

Although
 Andrea had recovered from her DVT, the veins in the pelvis had chronic 
scarring. This restricted blood flow and she was at risk of further 
clots.

Under general anaesthetic, we make a small incision, either inside the lower thigh, just above or behind the knee. A thin tube (catheter) is inserted and this releases the stent into the vein.

We use X-ray and a special device called intravascular ultrasound, a miniature machine that goes inside the vein, to see where the damage is and make sure we put in the right number of stents.

Patients need between one and four, depending on the extent of damage. Andrea needed three.

After the operation, we put a stocking on her leg and fitted special boots connected to a pump via flexible tubes to keep blood flowing normally, until she was up and walking the next day.

Some patients may need more than one procedure if the stent shows signs of blocking. If there hasn't been a problem within six weeks, it's usually OK long-term.

We keep patients on blood-thinning drugs for the first six months, just to be sure. If there isn't a blockage, there's no reason the stents won't last a lifetime.

Risks include bleeding in less than 1 per cent of cases (it's higher in the over-75s) and pulmonary embolism, also in less than 1 per cent of cases.

Each stent costs £1,200. The total cost is £4,500 if done privately, or around £3,000 to the NHS.
