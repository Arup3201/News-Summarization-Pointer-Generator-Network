James Bond was far from the suave, English gent portrayed in the 007 films, but rather a more troubled, heavy-drinking character, the new Bond author claims.

William Boyd, the novelist famed for 'Any Human Heart', and responsible for coming up with the next Bond novel in the Ian Fleming series, said that Bond's true character, until now, had been underplayed.

He told the Radio Times that in the Dr. No film, starring Sean Connery, Bond downed two bottles of bourbon, a bottle of champagne, a calvados and four dry martinis in one night.

Time out in the tub: James Bond was a bigger drinker than we have been led to believe claims next Bond author William Boyd

Martini, shaken.... you know the rest: The real Bond was not the suave Roger Moore-type English toff at all (left), but rather 'nuanced and interesting', said Boyd. Daniel Craig, right, with a Martini in Quantum of Solace

'In the films Bond is a cartoon character but in the novels he is far more troubled, nuanced and interesting', he said.

It is the clearest indication yet that the author plans to steer away from what he described as the 'cartoon' portrayed on film and take Bond in a direction more in keeping with the character's true self.

He pointed out that while the latest 007 film Skyfall sees Bond return to what is described as his childhood home in Scotland, the reality is that Bond actually grew up somewhere in Wiltshire, England.

Skyfall does, however, hint at Bond's darker side when he is shown at the beginning of the film looking washed-up and drunk, downing his sorrows in a beachfront bar.

Boyd admitted, however, that he deliberately avoided watching the latest film.

The portrayal of Bond as an English toff is also flawed, claimed Boyd, who said: 'Bond’s father was Scottish and his mother was Swiss so he didn’t 
have a drop of English blood in him. He’s not the suave Roger Moore-type
English toff at all.'

While some might argue that Bond's Eton credentials justify his English gent persona, the fact, as Boyd pointed out, is that he actually got expelled from Eton after a fling with a maid and completed his schooling at Tony Blair's alma mater, Fettes in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Realist: Bestselling Scottish author William Boyd said he was much more interested in creating a Bond that is a 'human' not a 'cartoon'

Like Bond, Boyd was also educated in Scotland, at Prince Charles' former boarding school Gordonstoun, having spent his early life growing up in Ghana, Africa.

He then went on to study and teach at Oxford University before abandoning it following the success of A Good Man in Africa, published in 1981.

In April this year it was announced that he would would write the next James Bond novel, having accepted the privilege from the Ian Fleming estate.

It is understood that the book will be set in 1969 and Bond will be middle-aged, at 45.

Boyd’s Bond book will be published next year, 60 years after the publication of Fleming’s first Bond novel, Casino Royale.

Fleming went on to write another 13 in the series, which has totted up sales of more than 100million.

Speaking at the Hay Festival earlier this year, Boyd said: 'He is a middle-aged man, a middle-aged spy, and that’s one of the things that interests me.

'I’m a realistic novelist and what interests me about Bond is the human being.

'There will be no mountains filled with atom bombs or global plagues, no gadgets, no superpowers or preposterous enemies - there will be an entirely believable psychopath, not a preposterous psychopath.

'And similarly with love affairs - in my novel they will be entirely believable.”

He added: 'The literary Bond is a far more interesting character than the Bond of the films, who is a sort of cartoon.

Boyd is the latest of three writers to take up the challenge of 
recreating the much-loved character.

Sebastian Faulks released 
Devil May Care in 2008 to mark the centenary of original author Ian Fleming’s birth while 
Jeffery Deaver’s Bond novel, Carte Blanche, was published last year.
