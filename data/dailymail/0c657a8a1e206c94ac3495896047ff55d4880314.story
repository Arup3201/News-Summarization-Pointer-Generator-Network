The woman who inspired The Beatles' song Dear Prudence was Robert Durst's mistress until days before his wife went missing.

Prudence Farrow, sister to Mia, had her name etched into cultural history at the age of 19 when she inspired John Lennon to write her a song at an Indian ashram.

But lesser-known is her affair with the alleged killer Durst who was arrested this month and charged with the 2000 murder of his friend, Susan Berman.

Durst, 71, was sensationally acquitted of the 2001 murder of neighbor Morris Black and has long been suspected of killing his first wife, Kathie, and then murdering long-time friend Susan Berman. 

According to the New York Post, Farrow and her husband Albert Bruns, to whom she remains married, were living in a New York City property owned by Robert Durst.

A decade later she was widely known to be Robert Durst's mistress. The alleged killer (pictured) was arrested on March 14 and charged with murder after a docu-series about his life screened on HBO

They married in the late 1960s but from 1980 to 1982, Farrow kept up a widely talked-about affair with Durst, according to a number of reports.

At one point, the Post notes, a 34-year-old Farrow called his with Kathie in an attempt to convince her to file for divorce.

It was a dark chapter more than a decade after she attended the same meditation retreat as John, George, Paul and Ringo, where she became an inspiration. 

In an attempt to reach enlightenment, Farrow refused to come out of her meditation tent.

Eventually, the story goes, John Lennon went over and sang the first semblance of Dear Prudence - 'won't you come out to play'.

The ditty became the second track on the band's acclaimed White Album.

Durst was acquitted of murder in 2001. He is now on suicide watch as he awaits trial in Louisiana

Farrow, whose mother Maureen O'Sullivan was Jane in Tarzan, later recalled how deeply immersed she was in the ashram.

But she refuses to touch on the allegations surrounding Durst. 

He was arrested in New Orleans on March 14 a day before the final episode of the HBO documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, in which he was shockingly caught on tape saying 'I killed them all,' at the end.

Police believe he was preparing to flee the country as he was found in a hotel room with a latex mask, false ID, a loaded Smith & Wesson .38 caliber revolver with one spent shell casing and $42,000 in cash.

A small amount of marijuana was also discovered.

He is now on suicide watch as he awaits trial in Louisiana on gun and drug possession charges and extradition to California to face a murder trial in the Berman case. 

Farrow is now a meditation teacher and author.
