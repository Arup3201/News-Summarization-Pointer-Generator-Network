Abuse: Denise Godefroid, 63, has been banned from speaking to her elderly Irish neighbors following a 14-year campaign of harassment

A woman who racially abused her elderly Irish neighbours and their grandchildren during a 14-year campaign of harassment has been banned from speaking to the couple.

Denise Godefroid repeatedly yelled at Veronica and James Hagans to go back to Ireland and, on one occasion, screamed at them to keep 'those bloody Irish children' quiet.

A court heard the 63-year-old also called the couple 'f****** stupid Irish', banged loudly on their wall while making whale noises at 3am, and peered into their bedroom from her adjoining balcony.

Southwark Crown Court was told Mrs Hagan has been so badly affected by Godefroid's behaviour that she does not leave the flat on her own - even to just put the rubbish out in the corridor.

Judge Stephen Robbins today issued Godefroid with an indefinite restraining order preventing direct or indirect contact with the Hagans.

She was also given a two year community order and ordered to keep to a six-month long curfew between 9pm and 7am at her home in Pimlico, central London.

Prosecutor James Fletcher said that Mr and Mrs Hagans moved in next door to Godefroid at the Joseph Conrad House flats in 1997.

He said: 'Since they moved in, over that period there have been a number of antisocial and nuisance type behaviours from the defendant towards Mrs Hagans and her husband.

'This included the defendant knocking loudly on wall in the early hours of the morning, at 3am, and singing or making whale noises, peering into their bedroom from an adjoining balcony and being verbally abusive.

'On at least two occasions the Crown has advanced evidence the harassment was racially aggravated.

'Mrs Hagans is Irish and on one occasion the defendant made comments such as 'You f****** stupid Irish. What did you come here for? Why are you in this country?

'On another occasion the defendant started swearing at Mr and Mrs Hagans' grandchildren saying 'Those bloody Irish children. Keep those f****** children quiet and get back to Ireland you f****** Irish.

'Mrs Hagan has been badly affected by the behaviour to the point that she felt that she could not leave the flat on her own, even to go out in the corridor to put the rubbish out.'

Godefroid had admitted a charge of racially aggravated harassment on or before June 9 last year.

She denied a second charge of racially aggravated harassment putting another in fear of violence and the offence was ordered to lie on file.

During today's sentencing hearing defence counsel Lance Murray said Godefroid wished to change her plea from guilty to not guilty.

He told the court Godefroid, who has been diagnosed as suffering with mixed personality disorder, agoraphobia, dementia and panic attacks, among other issues, had pleaded guilty because she 'if she proceeded with a trial it would kill her'.

He said: 'At one point we had my client on the floor on her knees so upset with the idea that the following day there would be a trial.

'She however insisted she was not guilty of the offence she had been charged with and she simply wanted it to go away.'

Judge Robbins ruled that it was 'not in the interests of justice' to allow Godefroid to change her plea.
