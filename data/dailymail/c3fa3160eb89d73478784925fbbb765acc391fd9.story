Romance, emotion, tears and lots of cringe-worthy moments - that's what to expect at your average wedding, according to a new survey.

The poll of 1,500 newlyweds found that the mother of the groom comes top of the list of most embarrassing people on the big day, while the mother of the bride cries on average six times.

Inappropriate jokes and fashion faux pas are also regular wedding features with the best man cracking two below the belt gags and, more often than not, two guests turning up in the same outfit.

Tradition is still key for British couples tying the knot with 39 per cent serving a traditional Sunday Roast for their wedding breakfast and 35 per cent sticking with a traditional theme

And that's not where the cringe-inducing moments end. Twenty two per cent of couples now choreograph a special routine for
 their first dance and 15 per cent of couples 
are so proud of their achievement that they also share the dance on 
YouTube.

The new wedding report, commissioned by QHotels, also found that there is on average one unexpected romance at every wedding and five people who can't hold back the tears. 

British couples still hanker after tradition at their nuptials with 39 per cent serving a traditional Sunday Roast for their wedding breakfast. But only 28 per cent of British couples stick with a traditional church 
wedding, compared to 33 per cent who opted for a registry office.

The mother of the bride will cry a lot but the mother of the groom is said to be the most embarrassing

Thirty five per cent of UK couples opt for a traditional decor and feel and couples also play it safe when it comes to the weather. Half of all weddings take place in summer, with the other half spread over the rest of the year.

The report also found that couples chose
 an average of two bridesmaids and two groomsmen. Of the couples 
surveyed, all said the people they chose to honour were childhood 
friends.

The wedding tunes making the big day playlist include Savage Garden's Truly Madly Deeply (chosen by eight per cent polled), The Goo Goo Dolls' Iris (favoured by seven per cent) and both Jason Mraz's I’m Yours and Amazed by Lonestar chosen by five per cent.

But however good the music not all wedding guests stay for the long haul - designated drivers call it a night at 11.55pm, although only 55 per cent of couples noticed them leaving.
