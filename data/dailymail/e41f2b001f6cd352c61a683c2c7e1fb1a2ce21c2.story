Recent extreme weather events have highlighted just how important it is to understand our planet’s behaviour.

And now a new space mission could help do just that by providing real-time measurements of rain and snow every three hours, all over the world.

The constellation of satellites will help fill huge gaps in precipitation observations as large areas of the Earth currently do not have radar coverage.

The satellite has unprecedented range, and will scan the skies between 65 degrees north and south latitude

The mission, known as Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), will also help scientists look through storms to see the internal dynamics and intensity of a hurricane.

The satellite has unprecedented range, and will scan the skies between 65 degrees north and south latitude.

Currently, Nasa’s Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) provides scientists with detailed data on rainfall and storms.

But the problem is it only covers a relatively narrow range. For instance, Hurricane Sandy could only be tracked by TRMM until it passed Florida before going out of range.

The first satellite of the constellation, known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, was launched on Thursday by Nasa and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa)

While TRMM measures precipitation in the tropics, the new constellation will also expand the coverage area from the Arctic Circle to the Antarctic Circle.

This is vital to understanding extreme events, like blizzards, floods and droughts which have wreaked havoc across the globe in recent months.

The first satellite of the constellation, known as the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory, was launched on Thursday by Nasa and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa).

‘With this launch, we have taken another giant leap in providing the world with an unprecedented picture of our planet's rain and snow,’ said Nasa administrator Charles Bolden.

‘GPM will help us better understand our ever-changing climate, improve forecasts of extreme weather events like floods, and assist decision makers around the world to better manage water resources.’

GPM is one of the ¿core¿ satellites in the constellation and will be carrying an advanced radar and radiometer system to measure precipitation from space. Pictured is the launch which took place on Thursday

GPM will also be able to detect light rain and snowfall, a major source of available fresh water in some regions.

‘We still have a lot to learn about how rain and snow systems behave in the bigger Earth system,’ said GPM project scientist Gail Skofronick-Jackson of Goddard.

‘With the advanced instruments on the GPM Core Observatory, we will have for the first time frequent unified global observations of all types of precipitation, everything from the rain in your backyard to storms forming over the oceans to the falling snow contributing to water resources.’

GPM is one of nine satellites in the constellation and will be carrying an advanced radar and radiometer system to measure precipitation.

The GPM Core Observatory is the first of Nasa’s five Earth science missions launching this year.
