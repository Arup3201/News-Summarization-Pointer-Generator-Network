Jonas Gutierrez has returned to training with Newcastle United following his battle with testicular cancer.

The 31-year-old was given the all-clear last month having undergone chemotherapy at home in Argentina.

But Gutierrez is now back on Tyneside and was at the club’s Benton headquarters on Friday where he met with staff and team-mates for the first time since beating the illness.

He is unlikely to be considered for selection in the short term but could make a return to competitive action next year.

Newcastle’s next home match is the Tyne-Wear derby with Sunderland where Gutierrez is sure to receive a warm welcome from both sets of fans should he be present at the game.
