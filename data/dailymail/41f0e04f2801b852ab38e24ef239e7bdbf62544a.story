Aviation fans are in for a treat as a 450-seater jumbo jet has been converted into a unique hotel - letting guests sleep on a Boeing 747.

The unique Jumbo Stay hostel has a selection of 27 cabins to choose from, with some en-suite and all with Wi-Fi and flatscreen TVs.

For frequent flyers it might not exactly be their cup of tea, in fact far from it, but for aeroplane enthusiasts, it could be the next big buzz.

Jumbo Stay: For those who have never had a Jumbo experience, they can now book a cheap night in a converted jet in Sweden for as little as £42 a night

Guests can even stay in the luxurious cockpit suite, which has panoramic views of the airport in Arlanda, near Stockholm, Sweden.

The plane - which now remains grounded - can also be used for conferences and is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week for guests to come and visit.

The owner and the man behind Jumbo Stay is Swedish business man Oscar Divs, who bought the 1976 Boeing 747-200 and converted it into the hostel.

Open for business: The 1976 Jumbo is now a fixed hostel feature at the Arlanda airport near Stockholm, in Sweden

Oscar said: 'I was getting ready to expand my hostel business in 2006 when I heard about an old wreck of an aircraft for sale at Arlanda.

'Since I had for a long time wanted to establish my business at Arlanda I didn't hesitate for a second when this opportunity struck.'

The airplane, a decommissioned jumbo jet built in 1976, was last operated by Transjet, a Swedish airline that went bankrupt in 2002

The unique style of accommodation is likely to appeal to aviation enthusiasts, but perhaps not frequent flyers

Mr Divs said the opportunity to buy the Jumbo came at exactly the right time: 'Since I had for a long time wanted to establish my business at Arlanda I didn't hesitate for a second when this opportunity struck'

Cosy: Guests have the same hotel luxuries as standard accommodation, including en-suites, flatscreen TVs and WiFi

Guests have a hefty flight of stairs to climb if they want to stay in the Jumbo, climbing to entrances either at the front or the back of the plane

The prices at the Jumbo hostel range from 50 euros - around £42 - for a shared single sex dorm to almost 200 euros - £170 - a night for the exclusive pilot's suite.

The airplane, a decommissioned jumbo jet built in 1976, was last operated by Transjet, a Swedish airline that went bankrupt in 2002.

Guests will recognise the jet as one of the most popular planes for holiday travel, and the owner promises guest will have an experience like no other in this novelty hostel.

Transformation: Much work has gone into converting the decommissioned Jumbo from a passenger plane to a comfortable hostel with places to kick back and relax

Some parts of the aeroplane still resemble the traditional Boeing 747 interior
