British driving licences are to feature the Union Jack as well as the current European Union flag under plans announced today.

Ministers said the changes meant that UK motorists will be able to ‘fly the flag with pride’ on the photo-card element of their licence.

The European Union flag alone has been displayed on full driving licences since photocards first came into use in July 1998.

More than 127 million photocard licences have been issued since they were introduced.

But today transport minister Claire Perry is announcing that anyone applying for a new licence or changing their personal details will be issued with a licence showing both the British and European Union flags.

The changes will apply to motorists in England, Scotland and Wales and provide road users ‘with a symbolic sign of their national identity’.

Transport Minister Claire Perry said: ‘People in this country rightly take pride in our national flag which is why I am delighted it will now be displayed on British driving licences.

'Celebrating Britain strengthens our sense of national identity and our unity. I will feel proud to carry my new licence and I hope others will too.’

David Cameron announced two years ago that he wanted to see the UK flag on British photocard licences. 

But the final go-ahead was postponed until after the referendum on Scottish independence.

Ministers feel that the driving licence is, alongside the passport, the single most widely used identity document in the UK and that it is an anomaly that the card is dominated by an EU flag.

They are using an upgrade to the licences - which will now include a microchip - as an opportunity to change its design.

An EU directive passed in 2006 requires the EU flag to be on the driving licence as part of the single market, but permits other symbols to be on the card.

In 1996, the Conservative government was planning to put the union flag and the crest on the then-new plastic card driving licences that were shortly to be introduced.

However, the Labour government that came in a year later reversed this decision, and the new plastic licences, first issued in 1998, had no union flag or royal crest.

One reason was that there was doubt that Catholic drivers in Northern Ireland would tolerate the union flag on their driving licence – and it still seems that no symbol will be placed on cards issued in Northern Ireland.

Ministers say the inclusion of union flags on licences is ‘one of a number of improvements being made for motorists’.

On 25 October this year, the DVLA announced a dramatic drop in licence fees for those who apply online.

In the interests of reducing unnecessary red tape, since October 1 this year the paper tax disc is no more and motorists can pay their vehicle tax by direct debit. 

From June 8 next year the paper counterpart of the photocard licence will no longer be required.

The DVLA has also introduced a service to allow the public to check the most up to date information on their driving record .
