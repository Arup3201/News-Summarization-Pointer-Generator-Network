She is known for having a flawless face that has won her the cover of Vogue and front row seats at fashion shows.

But Kim Kardashian didn't always look the way she does today.

On Sunday her childhood friend Nikki Lund shared never-before-seen photos of the 34-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star taken long before she became an international sensation.

Lund, who dates Bon Jovi rocker Richie Sambora, has shared images of Mrs Kanye West before.

But never has the singer, whose new song is North 2 South - This is It was released this year, shared so many.

In one image Kim looked chubby faced as she shows off bangs and thinner lips.

The reality diva also looked more natural with a hearty smile and lack of self-consciousness.

In another she looks older with thin eyebrows, bigger lips and short hair. She appeared to be about 18-years-old.  

A black-and-white photo shows Kim with braces on and longer hair. She had on dark lipstick and a black tank top that matched her choker. She was 19-years-old when the image was taken. 

Another portrait sees the two in a photo booth where Kim had bangs.

Lund also talked to The Mirror, where she told the publication her old friend struggled after the loss of her father Robert Kardashian, an attorney, in September 2003.

'Kim was a daddy’s girl, she adored her father and when she died she was devastated,' the singer said.

'Rob was the one who would make sure she was working hard and that she was behaving herself. I don't think this whole thing would be happening to her right now if he was still alive.'

Nikki also added that Kim was quiet as a child. 'She never wanted to be famous, it just kind of happened. She was always the quiet girl sitting in the corner while we were all being loud.'

The friend also said the mother of North West, aged one, was diligent. 'Kim was studious, she wanted to be a good student. She worked hard at school, she didn’t get straight A’s but the teachers liked her. She’d never bunk off school.'

And as a teen, Kim had her role models already.

'Kim was  obsessed with Jennifer Lopez, she would sing If You Had My Love all of the time. She thought she was beautiful. She also fancied P Diddy and Jamie Foxx – Kim always liked African-American men.'

In to her looks: Nikki also said, 'Kim was always on some sort of diet, we all were. She did the no-carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun'

Wanting to be like J-Lo meant Kardashian watched her weight. 'Kim was always on some sort of diet, we all were. She did the no-carbs thing and would ask for a burger with no bun. She was conscious of what she looked like, she didn’t have her bum then but the boys liked her. Kim got a lot of attention back then. 

'We were a bit dorky really. We loved the Spice Girls, when we were like 15 and 16 and we loved dressing up as them and singing along to their songs. Kim loved Posh Spice, she thought she was the prettiest one and she loved what she wore.

'She went out and bought herself a black leather dress with slits in it – it was exactly like Posh’s. Kim would do her make up like Posh’s and her hair was similar so she did actually really look like her.' 

They were friends too: Lund arm in arm with Kim's older sister Kourtney, now 35 and a mother of three children

On Sunday,  Kim has been in Paris taking in fashion shows. On Sunday she stepped out in two different looks.

The first one was quite risqué with her showing off her granny panties and bra in a Balmain cage dress and heels with a coat sitting on her shoulders just so.

The second outfit was more tame, but showed off quite a bit as well.

She had on a black top with zig zag string in the front tying her up.

Kinky boots made the E! star resemble Catwoman.

Husband West followed behind. Also in France is Kim's mother Kris Jenner.
