Students at the University of Oregon are facing possible prosecution after a snowball fight got out of hand and a professor at the institution was attacked.

The incident, involving a large group of students covering the lecturer's car in snow and proceeding to throw snowballs at him when he confronts them, was filmed and has since had more than two million views on YouTube

Several viewers are now calling for the snowball throwers to be prosecuted for vandalism and battery after attacking the innocent professor.

The video shows a large group of students involved in a snowballs fight to celebrate the season’s first fall.

According to local media, the winter battle had been organised by the University of Oregon football team on Friday afternoon.

Professor Sherwin Simmons drives into the firing line, and as he exits his car to reason with the students, he is attacked by multiple snowballs and one student even pours a bucket of snow on him.

As he confronts several students, others continue to pelt the art professor with snowballs.

The University of Oregon’s Police Department is currently investigating the incident and will determine whether or not the actions of the students involved constitute a criminal act, a statement from the university’s dean of students said.

‘Consequences are clear for those whose actions reflect poorly upon the university or violate its standards for student behavior,’ UO dean of students Paul Shang said.

‘However, until the facts of the snowball-throwing incident are sorted out, it would be premature to speculate about any potential outcomes in this case.’

Several students and members of the university football team have spoken out against the actions displayed in the video.

‘Embarrassed by the video I just watched. That’s not all of us, sending the sincerest apologies,’ one player tweeted.

The snowball fight has been scheduled to start around the lunch hour at 12.40, but turned 'rowdy' around 3pm, a student said.

‘At the time I had been in the snowball fight it was totally fun and it was cool because the people were there who wanted to participate,’ UO student Liana Lis told Daily Emerald.com

‘But then they started throwing it at cars and I had the gut instinct that it was just wrong and it got uncomfortable.’

The video was posted to reddit and has racked up nearly 10,000 comments and has led to a petition urging University of Oregon to ‘condemn and carry out deep disciplinary action against all those who participated in snow-fighting frenzy.’
