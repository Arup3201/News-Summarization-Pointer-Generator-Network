The surroundings of The Nash  – a five-bedroom house in the heart of Dorset’s Thomas Hardy country – are steeped in history.

The house is on the outskirts of the village of Marnhull, which is mentioned (though called Marlot) in Hardy’s Tess Of The D’Urbervilles and has been  used as a location for one of the many television adaptations of the novel.

Also, local pub The Crown Inn was renamed the Pure Drop Inn by Hardy and is where the beautiful and tragic Tess is first described.

The Nash, located in Marnhull, Dorset, sits in the old grounds of a manor house in which Henry VIII¿s sixth wife, Catherine Parr, lived and died

There are links to English royalty too. The Nash sits in the old grounds of a manor  house in which Henry VIII’s sixth wife, Catherine Parr, lived.

Parr – who, most would agree, was Henry’s most fortunate spouse, outliving him – retired to the manor house and, when she died, it passed to Elizabeth I.

But, despite all this history, The Nash itself, which is for sale at £1.5 million,  is relatively new. It was built in 1984 – the time of Elizabeth II rather than Elizabeth I – but within the walled garden of what had been Elizabeth I’s house.

On a still day, with no sound but the buzzing of bees and cheerful birdsong, it is easy to imagine these figures from history wandering within the now ancient walls. And from every single window of  The Nash you can see  either the spectacularly restored Elizabethan garden or the rolling Dorset countryside.

‘This is a home for garden-lovers,’ says  co-owner Adrian Shaw, 53. His parents  had lived in the house and he and his sister  are reluctantly selling it after his father  died last year.

Immaculate: Manicured hedges feature large in the secluded gardens at The Nash in Dorset

‘It needs a family living here,’ says businessman Adrian, who is based in Surrey with his wife and two daughters.

‘My parents had just retired when they moved in, and they painstakingly restored the gardens over almost 30 years.’

Vast, dark green and manicured yew hedges are planted within the stone walls, creating a number of separate and secluded gardens amid the three acres surrounding the house.

Within these, fresh scented box hedges are laid out in neat patterns, and stone urns  hold further shrubs.

‘There are few flower beds – the focus was on low-maintenance flowering shrubs,’ says Adrian. ‘Although the garden took a long time to complete, it’s not labour-intensive.’

Royal connection: Catherine Parr lived in the manor house after the death of Henry VIII, and Elizabeth I inherited it

The three-storey house was built from local stone by architect Brian Savage. And while he designed it in the style of the American Frank Lloyd Wright, it has an Italian feel – and an intriguing-looking tower.

There is a good-size fitted kitchen and breakfast room that leads straight through an archway into a vast, light conservatory. Here, eight huge canvas curtains sway.

‘We commissioned them from ships’ sails,’ explains Adrian. ‘The room gets so warm and bright in summer that it needs some shade.’

This conservatory is  large enough to hold a dining table as well as a sofa and chairs, and folding doors open into a huge formal drawing room. The colours throughout are muted greens, apricots  and creams.

A stunning large bedroom on the ground floor has doors into the garden and there is a charming bathroom with a corner bath.

There is also a downstairs toilet, a wine cellar, a storage room, a huge bright garden room and  a double garage.

‘There isn’t a master bedroom as such,’  says Adrian as we ascend to the first floor,  where there are three further big bedrooms and two bathrooms.

A wooden staircase leads up to the tower, which has 360-degree views and would make a perfect study or playroom.

Nearby Gillingham has a mainline railway station with regular trains to Waterloo.

Nick Evans, area director of Chesterton Humberts, Sherborne, says: ‘The Nash is a true gem. It combines landmark architecture and presence with a magnificent site, and will appeal to buyers looking for prestige, comfort, peace and tranquillity.’

Adrian says: ‘I have such fond memories  of this house. When my sister married, we had a marquee on the lawn, and of course many family Easter egg hunts, huge Christmas gatherings and my parents’ annual drinks party.

‘I’d love to think of another family enjoying themselves here as we did.’
