After encouraging fellow TV hosts to all wear the controversial 'penis jacket' during Thursday morning news broadcasts, Today show host Lisa Wilkinson failed to deliver on her promise to wear the clothing item during the  show - while ABC's Virginia Trioli rose to the challenge instead.

Wilkinson urged other news and television personalities to wear the phallic shaped Scanlan and Theodore jacket in a bid to reclaim the item of clothing as a legitimate wardrobe choice, following the controversy surrounding a Network 10 presenter wearing it on air. 

On Wednesday, the Today show co-host laughed off the online frenzy prompted by Natarsha Belling's jacket, saying she has the same item in her wardrobe.

Today show star Lisa Wilkinson failed to wear the 'penis jacket' like she urged her fellow TV hosts to do

Wilkinson appeared in an outfit distinctly sans-phallic neckline, wearing a navy and beige top for the show

'The #p***sjacket! REALLY? Calling all TVhosts who have this jacket to wear it on air tomorrow. I will! #geez,' Wilkinson tweeted to her 125,000 followers.

However, Wilkinson appeared in an outfit distinctly sans-phallic neckline, wearing a navy and beige top for the Thursday morning show.

'I realized [sic] at 3am this morning that I'd put my #penisjacket in for dry cleaning after wearing it last week. Big #LisaFail,' she tweeted, after a Today show fan pointed out her attire. 

Wilkinson wasn't the only television personality to dodge the jacket, as neither Sunrise's Natalie Barr and Samantha Armytage wore the infamous jacket.

ABC News Breakfast host Virginia Trioli appeared to be the only news anchor willing to answer Wilkinson's call, sporting a lemon jacket with a very similar neckline for the Thursday morning broadcast.

The original jacket which caused the social media uproar was designed by Australian label Scanlan Theodore and previously worn by Channel Seven’s Melissa Doyle in a fetching cream shade.

And the ‘Crepe Knit Double Peplum Jacket’, costing $550 is still available to buy on Scanlan Theodore’s website, after Doyle wore the design five days ago.

Wilkinson, apparently not put-off by the controversy, said she plans to wear her jacket tomorrow and called on other TV hosts to do the same

'Once you see it, you cannot unsee it...': This photo of Natarsha Belling's green jacket has been shared thousands of times online (left) after Melissa Doyle wore a similar jacket earlier in the year

However, Nine News Brisbane reporter Eva Milic appears to be the original trendsetter, wearing a maroon jacket with the much talked about neckline, clinched at the waist by a belt, back in May.

Belling’s green jacket went viral after she wore it to present Network Ten's Eyewitness News and a photo of the outfit was then liked over 110,000 times on Facebook after the website Unilad posted the caption ‘once you see it, you cannot unsee it’.

The image has also been shared over 7,000 times as the comments over Belling’s outfit rage on.

But phallic looking necklines are nothing new, as a 2010 photo of the ABC's Leigh Sales in a more extreme black number shows, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. 

Sales wore the cut out top while presenting Lateline and an eagle-eyed viewer uploaded a video of the clip to YouTube with the crude caption: 'ABC Lateline newsreader Leigh Sales wears a penis.' 

The bemusement and fascination with Belling's top appears to stem from the fact when you first look at the photo it’s hard to notice anything – but once the neckline’s shape is pointed out it’s hard to 'unsee' it.

Ruben Haywood wrote on Facebook, garnering 26,408 likes: ‘Like if you came here to find out what it is.’

Sarah Herbert wrote: ‘Yep, definitely cannot unsee this now.’ And Chris Thompson added: ‘Thank you, you have enlightened me on this picture.’

‘You legend I couldn't find what was happening but you've made me at ease now,’ Adam Baldwin said

And Lourens Odendaal realised: ‘Ooo that’s what it was… now I get it.’

Meanwhile, on Reddit, one commentator mused: ‘I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster about to burst from her chest.’ 

American anchor Dion Lim showed her support for Belling with the hashtag #anchorproblems

And another added: ‘I thought it was the slight crease in her v neck on the right side, yet the top was the same length… I was sure it wasn’t that so came to the comments.

‘I guess this means I'm growing up, because five years ago I’d see this straight away.’

On Tuesday, Belling received support from a fellow news anchor after the sartorial buzz reached the United States.

Reporter Dion Lim, who reports for the Ten News channel in Tampa, Florida, wrote: 'Oh c'mon. People ur reading too much into this! Anchor wears "phallic" jacket #anchorproblems.'

Facebook users were left bemused by the photo until looking up what the joke was about 

Sarah Herbert wrote: 'Yep, definitely cannot unsee this now'

Social media users laughed as they all realised what the joke was about 

One Facebook user pointed out 'you gotta have one to find one'

On Reddit, one commentator mused: 'I thought it was because her microphone looks like the claw of a monster'
