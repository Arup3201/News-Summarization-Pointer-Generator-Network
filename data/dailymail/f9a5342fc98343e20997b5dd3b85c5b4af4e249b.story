The highest paid Legal Aid barrister in Britain raked in nearly £700,000 of taxpayers’ money last year even though many lawyers refused to work because of a drop in fees.

John Rees QC earned a staggering £675,798 and is one of four barristers who received more than £500,000 in 2013, despite protests over a £2billion cut in public-funded legal aid which has caused many barristers to shy away from complex cases.

He specialises in fraud, has represented a number of alleged murderers and child abusers and is one of 20 lawyers who shared fees of nearly £8.5 million representing defendants.

Protests: Twenty of the country's top lawyers shared £8.5million in taxpayer-funded fees, despite many barristers refusing to work because of a cut in their fees

The
 government proposals have sparked angry protests by members of the legal profession and has led to the collapse of a high-profile fraud 
case.

Among the top 
earners was Lewis Power QC, who recently represented traveller Tommy 
Connors who was convicted of keeping vulnerable men captive and forcing 
them to work.

Connors, 53, 
was jailed for eight years, and his son Patrick, 21, for five, at Luton 
Crown Court last May, after being convicted of servitude, compulsory 
labour and assault charges.

The
 pair, from Bedfordshire, deliberately targeted men on the streets or in
 soup kitchens and promised them food and lodgings, but subjected them 
to shocking abuse.

Mr Power QC, who represented Connors Sr, received £372,664 from legal aid during 2012/13.

Nigel Power QC earned £399,925 for his work defending a number of high-profile cases.

One of his recent clients was 
Christopher Curran, who was cleared of the murder of pensioner Glynis 
Solmaz, who was choked to death while he burgled her home.

Curran
 admitted conspiring with three others to burgle Ms Solmaz's home in 
Wrexham, North Wales, last February, to steal £40,000 cash. Mr Power 
represented Curran who was jailed for four years at Mold Crown Court in 
November, while one of his accomplices, Alexandros Wetherill, was 
convicted of murder.

Anger: The £2billion cut in legal aid has seen the fees lawyers have paid for some cases slashed by up to 30 per cent. But many are still receiving huge taxpayer-funded payouts

John Rees QC earned nearly £700,000 in taxpayer-funded legal aid last year

John Rees QC is based in Cardiff, and was the highest-paid Legal Aid barrister in Britain last year, raking in £675,798

He specialises in serious crime and has worked on a number of high-profile fraud cases, which normally garner the highest legal aid fees.

He was educated at Jesus College in Cambridge and received a 'Blue' in boxing.

In 2011, he represented Cardiff City player Craig Bellamy after he was arrested for assault. The Welsh striker was found not guilty. 

He has also defended solicitors who have been accused of defrauding the legal aid system or private clients.

A section called 'quotations' includes 
one from an unknown client saying: 'If he murdered his wife, John would 
be his first port of call.'

Another says: 'His commitment, dedication, painstaking preparation and mastery of detail make him second to none in complex, serious fraud cases.'

Earlier in the month the trial of five defendants accused of a land bank fraud collapsed because barristers could not be found to defend the complex case at Southwark Crown Court, on the lower rate.

Last night Nigel Lithman, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, accused the Ministry of Justice of producing misleading figures to portray the profession as ‘universally wealthy’.

He said: ‘The earnings of 20 people continue to be published in a misleading way, namely including 20 per cent VAT, whilst excluding the substantial expenses that attach to the Bar and ignoring the fact that these fees may well reflect two or even three years' work. These figures continue to be published in a way that applies to no other professions.

‘The purpose can only be to portray the profession as universally wealthy, whereas the Government recognises that an average take-home pay is in accord with the national average and is below £28,000 per annum.’

The Ministry of Justice said: ‘We have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world and these kind of costs are exactly why we had to make changes.

‘We have reduced the cost of a small number of the longest running criminal cases by 30 per cent - just one of these cases recently cost more than £8 million in legal aid.

‘We want to ensure the limited money we have for legal aid is concentrated on those cases and people who need it most.’
