Police say they need to share DNA databases with forces across Europe because so much crime in Britain is committed by foreign nationals.

Senior officers want the Home Secretary to join an EU-wide scheme giving open access to forensic files.

They believe it would speed up the  laborious process of sending samples found at crime scenes to individual countries, so they can look for matches on their databases.

DNA match: Burglar Giani Radu poses on Facebook. Detectives had found blood at the scenes of several break-ins - but it was their Romanian counterparts who found the sample matched Radu

In one recent case, police found the blood of a prolific burglar in homes across the South East, but it was only when they got evidence from Romania that they were able to catch him.

But Theresa May has resisted the UK sharing DNA records automatically across Europe because of the fear that low-quality evidence from overseas forces could see innocent Britons locked up.

Last night a senior public official told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Politically the Government is afraid of the issue and therefore don’t provide the clarity.

'The police are saying, “if we want to be on top of these people that are moving across countries – some of them quite dangerous – then you need to let us manage the communications and the exchange of DNA information.” ’

National DNA Database spokesman, Chief Constable Chris Sims, said: ‘We fully understand the degree to which accessing other DNA databases would support investigations in this country and we are working very hard with the Home Office to find the best way to achieve this end.’

Nearly a third of all suspects arrested in London – as many as 80,000 people a year – are foreign nationals.

The number of foreigners in British jails has doubled over the past two decades, with 10,469 inmates in March. They account for 13 per cent of UK prisoners.

But if foreign criminals have not been in trouble in the UK, their details will not be on Britain’s databases. Britain has opted out of an EU-wide agreement among 15 countries to allow open access to DNA samples on civil liberties grounds.

Trial run: Home Secretary Theresa May told the Commons last week the Government would run a 'small-scale pilot' of the EU data-sharing measures

The Met’s forensics director Gary Pugh warned at a meeting of the National DNA Database Ethics Group that the Government’s opt-out ‘represents a challenge’ to police  trying to tackle the ‘scale of foreign national offenders in London’.

But Mrs May has deferred any decision until after the General Election. Romanian burglar Giani Radu,  23, was jailed last week for a string of offences in England – thanks to information from his homeland.

Detectives had found blood at the scene of several break-ins – but could not match it on their database.

They approached counterparts in Romania and found the sample matched Radu, who was jailed for burglary before moving to the UK and posed with cash on Facebook.

He admitted 23 counts of burglary and was jailed for  six years at Harrow Crown Court.

Home Secretary Mrs May told the Commons last week the Government would run a ‘small-scale pilot’ of the EU data-sharing measures then  publish a report on them for debate in Parliament by the end of 2015.

She said: ‘I would be negligent in my duty to protect the British public if I did not consider the issue carefully.’
