Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg accused Labour of wanting the recovery to not recover

The Labour party has been 'praying' the economic recovery does not recover so it can continue to attack the government, Nick Clegg claimed tonight.

The Deputy Prime Minister accused Ed Miliband and Ed Balls of wanting the recession to continue so voters would fee poorer at the time of the general election.

But Mr Clegg insisted Labour was to blame for the economic 'mess' left by the last government, and wages were now rising.

Mr Miliband will use a speech tomorrow to warn Britain faces another five years of squeezed incomes.

He claims the middle classes are missing out on the benefits of a return to growth, with wage rises outstripped by soaring prices.

Mr Miliband has rejected calls from within his own party for a more upbeat message to voters, instead claiming ‘millions of families are caught in the crosshairs of a cost of living crisis’.

But Mr Clegg hit back at the Labour leader, insisting the opposition had been 'wrong' on all the big economic judgements and had helped to bring 'the country to its knees'.

Speaking at City Network, a business forum reception in Central London tonight, Mr Clegg said: 'The Labour leadership has spent the last four years praying that the recovery would not materialise.

'For a long time they insisted that the Coalition’s action to tackle the deficit would choke off growth. Wrong: the deficit has been eliminated by a third and growth is back. 

'Then they claimed unemployment would rise by a million. Wrong: unemployment is coming down and we are seeing record numbers of people in work.

'Now, having decisively lost these 
arguments, Ed Miliband and Ed Balls have settled on a different refrain:
 blaming the Coalition for a crisis in the cost of living.'

Labour has seen its poll lead wither as
 the economic recovery has built momentum. Some surveys have put the 
party just one point ahead of the Tories, with more people trusting 
David Cameron and George Osborne to run the economy.

After
 predicting that austerity would lead another 1million out of work, 
Labour has been stung by figures showing there are 1.2million more 
people in jobs than when the coalition was formed.

More
 recently Mr Miliband has accused the government of overseeing a cost of
 living crisis, with people in work seeing small pay rises dwarfed by 
increases in food, energy and household bills.

However a new study today claimed middle class families weathered the 
recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for 
free childcare and taking on extra jobs.

Mr
 Clegg admitted it is 'certainly true' that many households have been 
under considerable pressure, with some families struggling to make ends 
meet.

But he added: 'We 
mustn't forget what got us here in the first place. In 2008 we 
experienced a crisis in our banks which brought the country to its knees
 and which damaged our economy in ways which were deep and profound.

'Labour
 were the authors of that crisis and yet they now seek to deny any 
responsibility for it.  They still do not understand that healthy 
household budgets flow directly from a healthy economy - you cannot 
divorce the two.

'When 
Labour were in government they made each family £3,000 worse off by 
overseeing a recession that wiped £112bn from our economy.'

He said the coalition was taking 
action to help create greater confidence, more jobs and further growth 
and helping families by easing childcare costs, freezing fuel duty and 
keeping council tax bills down.

Official figures show the economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the fourth quarter of growth in a row

Middle class families weathered the 
recession by shopping in cheaper supermarkets, using grandparents for 
free childcare and taking on extra jobs, a report published today 
reveals.

Households in the 
social group became ‘very good’ at adapting their spending and 
employment in order to ride out the crisis, says research by a 
think-tank.

Some even managed to move into a higher income bracket despite the economic downturn, the Social Market Foundation said.

More 
women went out to work as families sought to make ends meet, with the 
proportion of double-income households rising from 35 per cent to 49 per
 cent.

An analysis of 
household income also found that the middle classes became bargain 
seekers, switching stores and hunting out cheaper deals to avoid the 25 
per cent increase in food prices.

And
 there was also a dramatic rise in the number of people using the 
generosity of grandparents and other relatives to help with childcare to
 cut the cost of a childminder or nursery.

Middle earners are now using 20 per cent more ‘free’ care for the under-twos than they were in 2007, says the report.

Around
 one in five families deemed middle income in 2008 – with a net income 
of between £26,100 and £41,200 – fell down the income scale as a result 
of the financial crisis.

But two-fifths stayed where they were, and the remaining two-fifths have since climbed into the higher brackets.

Millions of people will be better off by not paying tax on the first £10,500 they earn, Mr Clegg added.

He went on: 'Ed Miliband is clutching at straws and now he’s down to his last one.

'Instead
 of making specious claims, the Labour party should take responsibility 
for the past: apologising to the British people for presiding over the 
biggest economic crisis in living memory and pursuing a credible 
economic strategy to prove that they have learnt from their mistakes.'

Experts
 expect wage increases to overtake inflation in the next few months, but
 Mr Miliband has made clear he will not abandon the line of attack.

He
 will use a speech tomorrow to set out what is being bill as ‘the next 
big economic reform of One Nation Labour’s plan to tackle the cost of 
living crisis’.

Tomorrow Mr Miliband is expected to signal action to tackle low pay, increase house building and encourage firms to hire more workers.

He will also back a plan for Britain’s great cities and towns to become ‘engines of growth’.

Ahead of the speech Mr Miliband warned that the return to economic growth does not mean the financial pain is over.

Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility predict that real earnings will increase at only half the level of GDP growth in 2015 and will continue to lag behind at least until 2018 - breaking the pattern of decades before the 1990s which saw middle-class living standards improving in line with the economy as a whole.

In an article for The Independent, the Labour leader wrote: ‘Millions of families are caught in the crosshairs of a cost-of-living crisis: a few people at the top scoop more and more of the rewards; markets such as energy have become uncompetitive, allowing huge prices to be imposed on consumers; and many of the new jobs being created require fewer skills, pay lower wages and offer less security.

‘This Government cannot deal with these problems because lying beneath its claims of being converted to full employment is an economic ideology built on low pay, low skills, low prospects and low productivity.

‘We can and must do better than this. Labour knows that if Britain stays in this race to the bottom, the cost-of-living crisis will continue - unaddressed and unsolved - for the five years of the next Parliament too.

‘Wages for most people will continue to lag far behind the wealth being created and middle-income families will still be locked out of the benefits of growth.’

But Conservative chairman Grant Shapps said Mr Miliband was talking about a problem ‘created by the Labour government’.

He said: ‘Labour's Great Recession made people who work hard poorer, and their unbalanced economy saw just one job created in the North and Midlands for every 10 created in the South.

‘Our long-term economic plan to secure a better for the whole of Britain is about creating jobs in every part of our country - meaning more people having the security of a regular pay packet. That's the only way to raise living standards for everyone.

‘But Ed Miliband has no plan. All he offers is short-term quick fixes, and more spending, more borrowing and more taxes. That's exactly what got us into a mess in the first place, and hardworking people will pay the price with a less secure future.’
