Stoke's Bosnian goalkeeper Asmir Begovic on Ibiza beats and playing at the Maracana...

Who is your sporting hero?

Growing up it was Oliver Kahn. He was the best in the world and someone I aspired to be like.

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

I would be involved in sports some way, so coaching. I’m a big sports nut. I love tennis, basketball, baseball and hockey.

Which other sportsman would you like to be?

I like Rafa Nadal, he’s a hero of mine. Or LeBron James. These guys are at the top of their games.

Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic said playing at the Maracana in the World Cup this summer was a career high

As a youngster, Begovic looked up to German stopper Oliver Khan who redefined the position during his career

Rafael Nadal is a hero of Begovic's, alongside other sporting luminaries such as LeBron James 

Career HIGHLIGHT?

Playing at a World Cup. We got to play against Argentina at the Maracana. It doesn’t get much better. No matter the results we made the most of the whole experience.

... AND THE worst moment?

There have been times when someone else was ahead of me and you get disheartened, but you have to fight.

The 27-year-old joined Stoke in February 2010 and has attracted interest from a number of different clubs

Wonderwall by Oasis is the Bosnian goalkeeper's go-to song if he is forced to do Karaoke

What’s the best advice you have ever been given?

To look after No 1 and believe in yourself. Football is a tough business and you need to make the most of your talents.

Favourite karaoke song?

Oasis, Wonderwall. I’ve done it once. I try to stay away from karaoke to be honest. 

If anyone had to play the big kepeer in a film of his life, Begovic would want it to be Mark Wahlberg

Begovic stunned Stoke supporters last season when he scored a goal  against Southampton

Three most-listened to songs on your ipod? 

Oasis, Wonderwall. Foo Fighters, The Pretender. White Stripes, Seven Nation Army. I listen before games, songs to get you pumping.

Last film you saw?

The Inbetweeners 2. It was good. Stupid humour.

Last book you read?

Barca by Graham Hunter. I enjoyed getting an insight into what it was like being part of the most successful team in the world.

Which three people would you invite for dinner?

Oliver Kahn, Muhammad Ali and Tom Brady, quarterback for the New England Patriots. I would love to pick their brains about what they’ve been through and what it’s taken to get to the top.

Your Favourite holiday destination?

Ibiza. I went for the first time this summer and fell in love with the place. We saw David Guetta at Ushuaia nightclub. I was beside the pool chilling out as he rocked the beats.

The Balearic island of Ibiza is Begovic's ideal holiday destination - seeing David Guetta there was a highlight

In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you?

Mark Wahlberg. He has that fighting character I relate to.

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

A Ferrari California, close to six figures. I wanted to buy a sports car and didn’t fit in many others. First World problem, I know.

Tell us a secret . . .

I can speak four languages: English, Bosnian, German and French. The difficulty is they are so very different. I get them mixed up in my head sometimes. With my parents I speak Bosnian, at home English. I’m trying to teach my daughter different languages.

Asmir Begovic was speaking on behalf of the Asmir Begovic Foundation, which raises money to improve sporting facilities in Stoke and his native Bosnia.
