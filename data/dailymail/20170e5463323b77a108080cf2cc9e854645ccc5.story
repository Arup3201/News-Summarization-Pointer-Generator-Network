Brazil will be without their injured talisman Neymar against Germany, but Joachim Low's side will still be greeted by the Barcelona star's smiling face after the country's federation backed a campaign for fans to wear masks of the forward at the Estadio Mineirao.

The 22-year-old, who has been his country's poster-boy throughout the World Cup, was ruled out of the tournament after breaking a bone in his back during the 2-1 quarter-final win against Colombia in Fortaleza.

After the severity of the former Santos striker's injury was confirmed, a Brazilian couple came up with the idea of supporters sporting masks of their hero during the semi-final showdown in Belo Horizonte.

Accompanied by the Twitter hashtag #somostodosneymar (we are all Neymar), the pair enlisted the help of an advertising agency to help spread the word.

The Brazil federation have since got behind the campaign, helping share an image of Neymar's face which can be cut out and worn by fans watching around the world.

Large numbers of Brazil supporters attending Tuesday's last four clash are expected to wear the masks as they look to inspire their country into the final on July 13.
