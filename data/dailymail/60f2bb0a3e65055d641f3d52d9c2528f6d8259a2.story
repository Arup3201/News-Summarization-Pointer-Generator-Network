Francesco Acerbi made his debut for Italy on Tuesday night less than a year after being told the testicular cancer that he was was diagnosed with in 2013 had returned.

The Sassuolo defender came on as a second-half substitute to make his first appearance for the Azzurri as Antonio Conte's side edged past Albania 1-0 in Genoa.

The 26-year-old was diagnosed with the illness in June last year before being finding out it had returned in December later that year.

But after being given the all-clear Acerbi returned to football with his club and has been a regular this season, doing enough to convince Conte of calling him up for the national side.

And after an emotional appearance as an 82nd-minute substitute the former AC Milan player revealed his pride, but insists he still has much more to achieve.

'With everything I went through, I am happy and proud, but I have objectives and when I've reached them I will be satisfied. What are they? I won't tell,' Acerbi told Rai Sport after the match.

'If you want to reach your targets, then you need to work hard, sweat and have that hunger within you. If you don't have it in you, then it's impossible to get there.'

Another debutant Stefano Okaka came off the bench to score the winning goal as Italy laboured to victory to extend their unbeaten run to six games since the World Cup.
