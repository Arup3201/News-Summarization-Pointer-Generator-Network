World number one Jenny Meadows has been forced to pull out of Sunday's 800 metres final at the European Indoor Championships in Prague through illness.

The 33-year-old, who has been battling a virus, admitted on Saturday when she scraped into the final on appeal that she would be unlikely to do herself justice in the medal race.

A statement from British Athletics confirmed the Wigan athlete had withdrawn from the race at the O2 Arena following a medical at the team hotel after her condition worsened overnight.

Meadows said: 'I'm really disappointed not to be running today. I went to bed really hopeful that I could compete and knowing that anything can happen in an indoor final.

'I've deteriorated further overnight and following discussions with medical staff and my coach, this could be one push too far for myself.

'I would have given everything I have got in me over those four laps, but I am serious about doing well in the outdoor season this year and that has to be the bigger picture.'

British Athletics Performance Director Neil Black added: 'We're massively disappointed for Jenny that she can't take her place on the start line.'
