A mother in the advanced stages of labor thought she had just enough time to stop off and register her four-year-old son at a school en route to hospital. But she was mistaken.

A school nurse and police officer helped Vanessa DeLeon deliver her fourth baby, Geovani Ezekiel, on Thursday at the campus clinic of Fisher Elementary School in Pasadena, Texas.

With no specialist medical equipment available, the newborn's umbilical cord was cut with string and school T-shirts were used as swaddling clothes.

Ms DeLeon says her contractions began 
earlier Thursday but that she was intent on registering her son, Alexis,
 for prekindergarten at Fisher before giving birth to her child.

Commenting
 on the chain of events, she told KHOU News: 'I walk [into the school] 
and tell the lady, "Here is the immunization and the package filled out.
 Is there anything I'm missing because I have to go now. I'm in labor."'

However, baby Geovani just couldn't wait to be born.

His
 mother added: 'At first I was like, "Oh my God. I can't believe I'm one
 of those ladies that has baby at one of those weird random places."'

It was Ashleigh Morris' second day on the job as school nurse Fisher when she was faced with the task of delivering a baby.

She said she was putting on her gloves when she saw the baby crowning and was forced to do the delivery bare-handed.

New family member: Baby Geovani Ezekiel weighed a healthy six pounds, three ounces

'I had no choice, mom pushed and we pulled the baby out,' Ms Morris recalled.

The mother and her newborn were doing well when they were later transferred to Bayshore Medical Center.

Geovani weighed a healthy six pounds, three ounces.

Alexis also got a spot in pre-K.

'Pre-K is very limited and he was asking me to go to school,' Ms DeLeon concluded. 'It's important he goes to school and learns a lot rather than sitting at home watching TV.'
