An American doctor caught Ebola while working for the World Health Organization in Sierra Leone has been released from an Atlanta hospital after conquering the disease - nearly six weeks after he was flown back to the US for treatment. 

The doctor's name was kept closely guarded and out of the public record while he was being treated in Atlanta since September 9.

 Hospital officials said man was released Monday 'to an undisclosed location' Sunday from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, after he was determined to be free of the virus and no threat to the public.

The man clung to his anonymity even as he neared a full recovery last week.

Still anonymous: The unnamed healthcare worker who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone before spending the last six and a half weeks at Emory University Hospital has gone home 'to an undisclosed location' and retained his anonymity

'As a result of the virus, my condition worsened and I became critically ill soon after I arrived at Emory,' the unnamed man said in statement. 

He continued: 'Through rigorous medical treatment, skillful nursing, and the full support of a health-care team, I am well on the way to a full recovery.'

'I want the public to know that although Ebola is a serious, complex disease, it is possible to recover and return to a healthy life.

'I wish to retain my anonymity for now, but I anticipate sharing more information in future weeks as I complete my recovery.' 

The man was transported to the hospital on September 9 after arriving in Atlanta on a jet. The World Health Organization disclosed that a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone had been evacuated out of Africa when he tested positive for the disease.

The unnamed healthcare worker was in Sierra Leone when he contracted the disease before being flown back to the U.S. for treatment in Atlanta. Some 1,200 hundred people have died from Ebola in the West African nation

However, hospital and health officials never released his name, in keeping with his family's wish for privacy.

Emory is one of four U.S. hospitals with specialized treatment units for people with highly dangerous infectious diseases. The others are in Maryland, Nebraska and Montana.

In a statement last week, the unidentified patient said that his condition worsened shortly after he arrived at Emory and that for a while he was critically ill.

His time at Emory - nearly six weeks - is the longest stay of an Ebola patient at a U.S. hospital. None of the seven others was admitted for more than 3 1/2 weeks.

In August, Emory treated two U.S. aid workers who were infected in Liberia and evacuated to Atlanta. Both were released from the unit within three weeks.

Emory is also treating a nurse, Amber Joy Vinson, who was infected at a Dallas hospital while treating a visitor from Liberia. She arrived last week. Emory officials did not provide a condition report on her Monday.
