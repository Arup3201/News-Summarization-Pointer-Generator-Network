Manchester City are close to tying up a £6million deal for Willy Caballero after the Malaga goalkeeper flew into the country on Monday.

Cabellero, 32, is expected to undergo a medical before completing his move to the Premier League champions.

The Argentine, who worked with City boss Manuel Pellegrini at Malaga, will come in as No 2 to England goalkeeper Joe Hart following Costel Pantilimon’s move to Sunderland on a free transfer.

Time to strengthen: City boss Manuel Pellegrini is busy adding to his squad ahead of the new season

It is understood that the fee for Cabellero could rise to £10m based on appearances and the club’s success during his time at the Etihad.

He becomes City’s third signing of the summer following the arrivals of midfielder Fernando from FC Porto and Arsenal right-back Bacary Sagna.

The club’s priority remains a central defender, however, and it seems increasingly like that Pellegrini will move for Roma’s Mehdi Benatia if his first-choice, Eliaquim Mangala of Porto, continues to stall over a move.
