Hunter Marr died on January 6 after suffering from breathing difficulties 

The parents of a nine-year-old boy, who died only 16 hours after being released from hospital, have said they hope the coronial inquest into their son's death will bring those responsible to justice. 

Hunter Marr, from Ormeau in Queensland, died after suffering a suspected asthma attack on January 6.

His father, Matthew, told Daily Mail Australia that he will attend every day of the week long coronial inquest into Hunter's death, which begins on Friday.

'I won't rest until the people that should be brought to account, are held to account,' Mr Marr said.

'I'm going every day. I'm going to look them in the eye.'

'The one thing we most want is for the people who should have done their job to be brought to justice - that's what Hunter deserves; he was an innocent boy.'

The father-of-three's son passed away after spending three nights in the Mater Children's Hospital in Brisbane's south.

'He wasn't breathing properly, he was struggling to breathe and he was very, very pale,' Mr Marr said.

'This happened on the Thursday, he went into hospital in the night time and by Sunday they were talking about discharging him.

He said he can vividly remember the moment his wife, Michelle (pictured with Hunter) screamed as their son passed out only 16 hours after being discharged from hospital 

'They said they won't discharge him until we get the test results back, but they discharged him anyway. 16 hours later, he died.'

'I couldn't believe it,' Mr Marr said of the moment his son was discharged. 

He said he could vividly recall the moment that his wife Michelle, woke him up to tell him their son was struggling to breathe on the day he died.

'I went out to call the ambulance and he passed out on the couch and Michelle just screamed.

'I dream it every night. By the time triple zero had answered, I had him on the floor and had started CPR.'

'He was a comedian. He was a card,' Mr Marr said of Hunter, before adding: 'His birthday was on October 20, He would have been 10. That was the single most hardest day since he died'

Mr Marr said that it took the ambulance 20 minutes to arrive at their family home before paramedics took over applying CPR and transported the nine-year-old to hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

More than 10 months after Hunter's death, a coroner's inquest will look into  what caused his death as well as the circumstances leading up to the death and the appropriateness of the health services provided by the Mater Children's Hospital and Queensland ambulance service.

'He was a comedian. He was a card,' Mr Marr said of Hunter, before adding: 'his birthday was on October 20. He would have been 10; that was the single most hardest day since he died.

'He's such a beautiful boy, I don't know anybody that wouldn't warm to him. He was a good kid, very humble.

'The inquest will look at perhaps what could be done differently and if there are people accountable for his death. I personally believe there are people accountable,' Mr Marr said.
