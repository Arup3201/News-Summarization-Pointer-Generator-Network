A secret eater who gorged on midnight snacks while pretending to eat healthily throughout the day has lost more than a stone - after taking up weight lifting.

Aysha Hoare, 23, used to regularly binge on bars of chocolate before bed after a day of munching on salads - or sneak in sweets while on the way to the gym.

Now a slim size 8, Aysha, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, managed to drop two dress sizes and more than a stone in just 12 weeks after ditching the late-night treats and taking up weight training.

By ditching the secret snacking Aysha managed to drop from 10st 5lb (left) to 8st 11lb (right) 

At night Aysha often found herself  sneaking back downstairs to devour whatever she could get her hands on

Aysha, who went from 10st 5lb to 8st 11lb said: 'Even though I was eating well during the day, I wasn't losing the weight I felt I should have.

'Appearances can be deceptive because I was coming home most evenings and tucking in to sugary treats.'

Having been slim throughout her teens, when Aysha started work as a retail assistant, her busy routine meant she strayed to eating junk food and sweets.

She said she could easily get through a packet of biscuits in just a day and always had sweets in her pocket or in her car to eat while on the go.

Desperate to curb her expanding waistline, Aysha started going to the gym and skipping breakfast.

But what she couldn't put a stop to was her sweet tooth, and despite her efforts to stay slim during the day, at night she often found herself  putting her pyjamas on and then sneaking back downstairs to devour whatever she could get her hands on.

Even spending hours on the cross-trainer every week couldn't fight against her snacking habits.

Exasperated at her lack of progress, she decided to try a different approach to shift the pounds. 

Aysha started a 12-week body transformation programme which meant cutting out all the sweet treats she lived on, and taking up an intensive gym schedule with weight training.

Instead of biscuits and toffee sweets, dessert became protein-based puddings that enhanced, rather than hindered, her training.

And in 12 weeks she had lost 11.2cm from her waist and 5.6cm from her hips.

Aysha said: 'I was going to the gym and then coming home and eating junk food - it really defeated the point.

'Because I felt I'd been good all day, I really wanted something naughty to eat and I felt I'd earned it.

'It became my secret habit - I didn't tell anyone that I was snacking away on chocolate after everyone else had gone to bed.

'Thankfully doing the Ultimate Sports Nutrition programme helped me stay on the straight and narrow.

'When you've got a programme to stick to, it makes it so much easier. I needed the motivation it gives you to keep going and not give up. 

'I genuinely believed that running around and getting cardiovascular exercise should have been enough.

'Never did I think in a million years that weight training would help me but it was on the programme so I thought, "OK, I'll give this a go".

'The results were incredible. People at work noticed and even asked me if I was eating enough.

'I had to keep reassuring them, "I am eating more than you can imagine!".

'I've always loved my food and could never have done a diet where it meant cutting out all important calories.

'This way I've changed my attitude to food - no more midnight snacks for me - and gained an all-round healthier lifestyle.

'And I have achieved my dream body and the confidence I've always wanted.'
