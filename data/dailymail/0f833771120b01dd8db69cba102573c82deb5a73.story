While most teenagers are playing computer games, Shandor Larenty likes to indulge in a different pastime - taming lions.

The 18-year-old has built up an unbreakable rapport with 250kg Zavu - stroking, hugging and playing together at home in Johannesburg, South Africa.

The pair are now so comfortable with each other Shandor is even able to give the huge cat a foot rub.

In the family: The teenager's wildlife expert father Alex was famously pictured also giving a foot rub to another lion named Jamu

The teenager, who is originally from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, said: 'I've grown up doing this - it is something I love.

'My friends think I'm a little bit crazy going in with a fully grown lion.'

Third-generation lion tamer Shandor showed early signs of carrying on the family tradition - interacting with elephants aged just 13-months-old.

His first big cat encounter was with a cheetah aged 11 and he has never looked back.

'A lot of the lions that I work with were born when I started learning, so I've grown up with them,' Shandor said.

'Zavu is a special lion because he absolutely loves me and we are best friends.Â

'He loves to be cuddled and be centre of attention. One of his favourite things though is the foot massage.'

The move mimics a technique his wildlife expert father, Alex, 54, perfected with fellow male lion Jamu.

Alex, who relocated to South Africa in 1999 from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, has been passing on his lion taming skills to Shandor so he can continue the family's business of supplying big cats for TV shows and movies.

Shandor, speaking from the family's dedicated South African Lion park in Johannesburg, added: 'My dad has always encouraged me to go into the wildlife field since I was a toddler.

'He is my mentor. Everything I've learnt about working with these animals has come from him.'

Despite the risks involved Shandor doesn't fear working with one of nature's most dangerous hunters - and uses just a feeble stick for protection should things go wrong.

He said: 'Lions are extremely powerful. A male can weigh up to 250kg and have a jaw pressure of one tonne per square inch. Those teeth are very long and could do a lot of damage.

'An animal could turn on me and I would end up dead, but with my dad's experience it is very unlikely that would happen.

'I'm pretty confident going in with the lions now. The key is to show you aren't scared because they will take advantage of it if you are.

'When you go in with them you have to make sure you can stand your ground.'

Proud father Alex added: 'You never know if your kids are going to follow in our footsteps, but I think it is great that he has. He's now doing virtually what I am doing.

'I do fear for his safety sometimes but then that's why I'm there. You train these lions to do all sorts of things, but you can't train them not to eat you.

'He's still learning his trade, but for someone his age he is doing extremely well. I've got to watch my job, he's after it.'
