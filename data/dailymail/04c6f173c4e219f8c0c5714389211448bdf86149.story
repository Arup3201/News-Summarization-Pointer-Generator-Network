Chelsea take on Tottenham at Wembley Stadium on Sunday as the two sides go head-to-head for the Capital One Cup trophy. 

The Blues fell to a surprise 5-3 defeat against Spurs on New Year's Day as Tottenham striker Harry Kane helped his side earn all three points at White Hart Lane.

Jose Mourinho's side will be hoping to exact revenge against Tottenham after losing to their London rivals in the League Cup final in 2008. 

Here, Sportsmail compares the two predicted line-ups for Sunday's clash.

Thibaut Courtois 8.5

Hugo Lloris 9

Belgian shotstopper Courtois has done well since finally donning gloves for Chelsea after a loan spell at Atletico Madrid which saw him become Europe's hottest property. However, a few recent mistakes have seen him rotated with Blues stalwart Petr Cech. 

In Lloris, Spurs have the finished article. The Frenchman is one of the most sought-after keepers on the continent and vies with David de Gea for the title of the Premier League's finest No 1. 

Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois and Tottenham's Hugo Lloris are among the best keepers in the Premier League

Branislav Ivanovic 8

Kyle Walker 7

To be the fiercest competitor in this Chelsea team takes some doing, but Ivanovic is just that. His never-say-die attitude is only matched by his uncanny ability to pop up with crucial goals. Once one of the premier talents in English football, Walker must work on his defending if he is to become the real deal. However, his attacking from full back remains a real threat and a pinpoint cross from him could decide the final.

Branislav Ivanovic is an important member of Jose Mourinho's side while Kyle Walker is back to full fitness

Gary Cahill 7

Eric Dier 7

England centre half Cahill has come in for flak this season, shipping quite a few goals through errors - notably against Spurs on New Year's Day. He remains a solid presence on his day but it's touch and go whether him or Kurt Zouma will get the nod. Youngster Dier has seen off the challenges of Vladimir Chiriches and Younes Kaboul to become Tottenham's first-choice centre half. The threat of Diego Costa, however, will be the ultimate test.

Gary Cahill's form has dipped this season while Eric Dier has wormed his way into Spurs' first team 

John Terry 9

Jan Vertonghen 8

Chelsea's evergreen skipper has continued his impeccable form under Jose Mourinho. Still the best centre half in the Premier League, if he has is hands on the trophy come Sunday you suspect he'll have more to do with it than anyone. Vertonghen has been more inconsistent than his first season at the Lane, but remains Tottenham's defensive rock on his good days.

John Terry will be hoping to lift the cup, while Jan Vertonghen is out to win his first trophy at Spurs

Cesar Azpilicueta 8

Danny Rose 7

Englishman Rose has drawn criticism for his defensive work despite his attacking presence and ability to grab a goal, while Azpilicueta is the polar opposite. The converted right back has been one of Jose Mourinho's most consistent performers.

Cesar Azpilicueta and Danny Rose are both expected to start at left back for their respective sides 

Ramires 7.5

Nabil Bentaleb 7

Nemanja Matic's suspension is terrible news for Chelsea, the big Serb being the cornerstone of Mourinho's side. While a vastly different player, the experience and pace of Ramires is handy to call on. Bentaleb is just one of a host of Spurs youngsters to come into the side and efficiently make a first team spot his own.

Ramires will fill in for the suspended Nemanja Matic, while Nabil Bentaleb is expected to get the nod 

Cesc Fabregas 8.5

Mousa Dembele 8

Arsenal fans were beside themselves when their former favourite son returned to the capital in blue, and Fabregas' role as Chelsea's creative master have shown why, even if recent performances have waned. Dembele is one of several Pochettino success stories, a hugely adept technical and physical presence in the Spurs midfield.

Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas will go head-to-head against Tottenham's Mousa Dembele 

Willian 8

Andros Townsend 7

Tireless Willian has been one of Chelsea's leading lights over the past couple of months, surely to the chagrin of new signing Juan Cuadrado. Fans often want more end product from the Brazilian, but he's one of the first names on Mourinho's teamsheet. Townsend has overcome a poor 12 months after emerging as one of England's brightest hopes, but questions still remain over his consistency and ability in big games.

Willian is expected to start ahead of Juan Cuadrado, while Andros Townsend could pose a threat on the wing

Oscar 8

Christian Eriksen 8.5

Eriksen has been one of the players of the season, his vision, creativity and eye for goal constantly digging Spurs out of a hole with partner in crime Harry Kane. Brazilian Oscar struggles slightly with consistency in this Chelsea side, but on his day will be man of the match. His all action displays in the No 10 role belie his tender years and scream 'Mourinho player'.

Oscar and Christian Eriksen are two of the best playmakers in the Premier League 

Eden Hazard 9.5

Erik Lamela 7

Hazard is one of the finest players in the world and in full flow the best to watch in the Premier League, with most of Chelsea’s attacking play being driven by him. Lamela has improved under Pochettino but still looks a far cry from what Tottenham expected for £30million

Eden Hazard and Erik Lamela have the potential to win the match for their side by producing a piece of magic 

Diego Costa 8.5

Harry Kane 8.5

Two of the stars of the season, local boy come good Kane has lit up the scoring charts and put Chelsea to the sword on New Year’s Day. In Costa, however, the Blues have a behemoth, capable of terrorising defences with a frightening mix of tenacity, physicality and scoring prowess.

Costa and Kane have scored goals for fun during the course of the season
