Novak Djokovic fought off a stiff challenge from Kei Nishikori as the Serbian won in three sets to reach the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in London.

The world No 1 lost his first set of the week at the O2 Arena as Nishikori mounted a comeback but eventually triumphed 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 in one hour and 27 minutes.

Defending champion Djokovic will play the winner of Saturday night's remaining semi-final between Swiss compatriots Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.

Djokovic was bidding for revenge in his first meeting with Nishikori since losing an epic four-set match in the semi-finals of the US Open in September.

And in fitting with the theme of the tournament so far, Djokovic claimed an early break for 3-1 as Nishikori put a volley wide and then raced to the opening set in 23 minutes, dropping just two points on serve.

Things looked ominous for Nishikori as he was broken in the opening game of the second set but it was at this point the match turned.

Djokovic played a poor service game as he attempted to consolidate, hitting a double fault to gift the break back and then sarcastically applauded the crowd as they cheered.

Djokovic lost his concentration and his level dropped with Nishikori taking full advantage, breaking for a 5-3 lead with a stunning inside-out forehand pass just moments after he had his right wrist taped by the trainer.

Nishikori then served out the set comfortably to level the match, with Djokovic hitting a forehand wide to bring to an end his run of 17 sets in a row.

With the momentum very much with Nishikori, the Japanese had two break points at the start of the third set but will have been hugely disappointed as he dumped a forehand and a backhand into the net on both.

That proved pivotal as Djokovic held and then won five games in a row for the bagel set and his 31st consecutive win indoors to seal his place in Sunday evening's final.
