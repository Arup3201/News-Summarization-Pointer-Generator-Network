With its blazer-wearing spectators, Pimm's and strawberries, Wimbledon has long been a byword for smart English summer style.

Despite attempts by players to get round the all-white dress code, the All England Club officials have been quick to clamp down on them - even coloured trim is out if it measures more than 1cm.

But for those watching the action this year, it seems, different rules apply.

Debenture ticket holders, who pay £50,000 for a five-year ticket, no longer have to adhere to a 'smart but casual' dress code.  Instead, pretty much anything goes - even trainers, as long as they're not too dirty.

How they were: Last year, spectators at Wimbledon's Centre Court wore smart blazers, shirts and ties

How they are now: This year, spectators may wear anything apart from ripped jeans or dirty trainers

The traditional smart dress code has been relaxed for 2014, and now only 'torn jeans, running vests, dirty trainers and sports shorts' are deemed unacceptable.  Even shorts are allowed, as long as they are 'tailored'.

As a result, spectators have been spotted tieless, in head-to-toe denim, on Centre Court's most exclusive, not to mention expensive, seats.

One debenture ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said the relaxing of the rules had ruffled a few feathers in SW19.

'We pay a lot of money for our tickets, and getting dressed up to watch the tennis is part of the whole thing,' he said.

'It's a shame to turn up and see people in jeans and t-shirts sitting along from you.  It doesn't feel right at all, especially as they've just tightened the rules on what the players wear.'

Debenture tickets are released for sale every five years, offering a Centre Court seat for every day of the tournament for a five-year period.

The next batch of debentures will cover the period 2016-2021 and went on sale last month for £50,000 each.  Debenture ticket holders can transfer their tickets during the five-year period to anyone wanting them enough; according to the All England Debenture website, the most recent debenture sale price was £105,500.

The loosening of the rules over debenture seats dress code comes at the same time as the introduction of tighter guidelines governing what players wear on court.  No longer can women wear bright coloured pants, as Maria Sharapova did last year.

The new rules came after concerns were voiced at sponsors sneaking more colour into their players' outfits to promote their brands.

Wimbledon is one of the very few major sporting tournaments not to have major advertising around the courts.

Officials there appeared to be hardening, rather than relaxing, their attitude to spectators' dress.  Just two years ago, organisers issued a dress code for members of the All England Club, following concerns that sartorial standards were slipping amongst members.

Photographs of acceptably-dressed members were included in the handbook for the first time, illustrating how to avoid the disgrace of being banned from the clubhouse.

It stated: 'The dress standard for gentlemen is lounge suit or tailored jacket, shirt, tie, trousers and dress shoes.

'Ladies are expected to dress to a similar standard.'

The other photographs illustrated 'unacceptable dress', and offending items included 'T-shirts, distressed jeans and trainers, bare midriffs, jeans and flip flops'.

Strapless tops and shorts were banned, as were 'zipper jackets, casual or scuffed shoes, hoodies, pumps and short skirts'.

Not so traditional: These spectators took inspiration from tennis balls for their unusual Wimbledon style

Members were warned: 'The Club's dress standards in the Members' Enclosure will be strictly enforced.

'To avoid any embarrassment please ensure your attire and that of your guests is appropriate.'

Founded in 1877, Wimbledon has always been part of the English summer Season when, traditionally, the landed gentry would come up to London for a summer of entertainment.

Other events include Chelsea Flower Show, Royal Ascot, and the Henley Regatta.

No-one at the All England Club was available for comment on the new debenture dress code today.

New rules were introduced this year in a bid to clamp down on sponsors sneaking in bright, branded sportswear.

Now every article of clothing - including knickers - have to be white, and that means white, not cream or even off-white.

The new rules state that coloured trim around the edge of clothing is out if it is more than a centimetre wide, and they apply even to caps, wristbands, socks, and bandanas.

Some players were outraged at the stricter dress code, saying that white knickers under a short white skirt would go see-through when players sweated.

Former tennis star Pat Cash said some female players had to go bra-less after their coloured bras showed through their white t-shirt when they perspired, while he said men had the same problem with navy underpants.
