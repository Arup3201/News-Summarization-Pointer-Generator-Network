The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will travel to one of the smallest and most remote nations in the world as part of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations next year.

Tuvalu, a tiny group of islands in the South Pacific, is delighted to host an official visit by the couple when larger rivals such as Australia and New Zealand will miss out.

Its consul to the UK, Iftikhar Ayaz, told the Mail yesterday that his country’s 10,400 inhabitants were ‘very excited’ that such ‘a small and faraway state’ had been chosen and promised William and Kate a welcome they would not forget.

When the Queen and Prince Philip 
visited Tuvalu in 1982, they were carried from their ship to the shore 
in garlanded canoes hoisted on the shoulders of dozens of handsome young
 men.

‘I have had the 
pleasure of meeting the Queen on several occasions and she still 
remembers the experience very vividly indeed,’ said Mr Ayaz. ‘Of course 
the Duke and the Duchess can expect the same welcome.’

Buckingham Palace yesterday announced dozens of visits by members of the Royal Family to mark the Queen’s 60 years on the throne. Her Majesty’s own itinerary will take in ten regions of the UK between March and July, as well as hosting four days of events over an extended bank holiday weekend in June.

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of 
Cornwall will travel to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Papua New 
Guinea. Charles will make additional trips to the Channel Islands and 
Isle of Man.

Prince Harry will undertake his first 
solo tour on behalf of the Queen, taking in Belize, Jamaica and the 
Bahamas probably in early March.

Prince Andrew will visit India; Princess Anne Mozambique and Zambia; the Duke of Gloucester the British Virgin Islands and Malta; and the Duke of Kent the Falkland Islands and Uganda.

First royal visit for 30 years: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh tour Tuvalu, a Pacific Island, in 1982. Next year the Duke and Duchess and Cambridge will follow in their footsteps

Prince Edward and his wife, the Countess
 of Wessex, have bagged what is considered to be one of the ‘plum’ trips
 – touring the Caribbean, including Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, 
Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the 
Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, with an extra visit to Gibraltar.

But it is the trip by William and Kate, which also takes in Malaysia, Singapore and the Solomon Islands, which is likely to attract the most interest.

No firm dates have yet been agreed but it is likely to take place in the autumn.

‘We are very proud of having the Queen as our head of state and were happily planning to celebrate her jubilee when this wonderful news came through,’ added Consul Ayaz. ‘A few years ago there was a move to declare Tuvalu a republic, but the reaction of the public was so strongly against it that it was quickly dropped.

‘As the islands that make up Tuvalu are very remote – some are 500 kilometres apart – the news will take a while to filter through, but all of the residents will be delighted.

Prince William and Kate raised more than £1m for severely malnourished children in famine-hit east Africa through a charity visit.

When the royal couple visited a Unicef supply centre in Copenhagen, traffic to the UK charity’s website rocketed by 226 per cent.

Extra interest in the charity meant they were able to rake in extra money in donations – enough to buy two weeks' worth of high protein emergency food for 100,000 of the most acutely malnourished children.

The fundraising total combines thousands of public donations as well as 'in-kind' support, including free cargo space from leading airlines British Airways and UPS, as well as life-saving supplies to the value of £520,000 from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge helped pack boxes of emergency health kits on their visit to help the 320,000 children who are at imminent risk of death.

During the visit, William said: 'An incredible amount is being done. Unicef is leading the way and doing a fantastic job, but sadly there's lots more still to do, and that's why we're here today.'

David Bull, executive director of Unicef Uk, said: 'Their Royal Highnesses are helping to save and transform children's lives in East Africa.'
