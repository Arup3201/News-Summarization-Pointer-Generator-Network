A policeman who preyed on drunk students to film up their skirts with a secret camera has been spared jail despite being branded a 'figure of national shame'.

Manchester PC Kevin Dwyer, 39, faces losing his job of 13 years and his pension after a court heard he filmed one victim in full uniform while pretending to investigate a crime.

The disgraced officer targeted young women who were drunk and sometimes vomiting - winning their trust by saying he was a first aider before aiming the camera up their skirts.

Voyeur: PC Kevin Dwyer, 39, left on duty and right outside court, used a secret camera hidden in his pocket to film up the skirts of drunk students. He was spared jail today at Manchester Crown Court

The voyeur also twice crept up to a window to film a young couple having sex inside a building, Manchester Crown Court heard.

Today a judge spared him jail and decided not to impose a fine, unpaid work or compensation.

Instead he was handed a three-year community order which will involve him attending a sex offenders' course to address his behaviour.

He was also handed a five-year sexual offences prevention order which stops him filming up women's skirts 'without their consent'.

The PC was also told he must make any camera, video camera or image-storing memory card available to police officers on request.

Judge Robert Atherton told him: 'You chose to go at a time when students were likely to be on the streets and perhaps in conditions when they would not realise or properly interpret what you were doing.'

Dwyer, who targeted women in Chester, Warrington and Manchester, is suspended and faces losing his job - together with his police pension - after formal misconduct hearings.

Disguise: PC Dwyer, used a helmet to hide his face at a previous hearing, and will be sentenced today

The disgraced PC went to desperate lengths to avoid press photographers outside Manchester Crown Court, arriving for today's hearing in a motorcycle helmet.

After he pleaded guilty to two counts of voyeurism and ten of outraging public decency on Friday, he sneaked through an emergency exit - which set off the court's fire alarm.

He swore at one reporter as he entered the courtroom today and was warned he would be jailed if he left court through an emergency exit again.

'Mr Dwyer went through one of the emergency exits thereby setting off the fire alarm without the consent of anyone,' the judge added. 'I regard that as reprehensible.'

His lawyer Patrick Thompson apologised and said: 'He is at the moment a figure of national shame and did not want it to get any worse.'

Dwyer, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, was Hull firefighter for two years before joining the police in 2002 and was working patrolling Manchester city centre when he was arrested in May last year. 

When officers searched his computer equipment at home they found a cache of secret films taken by him on a Sony camcorder.

Detectives seized a recording device in the pocket of his police uniform trousers and traced his Renault Megane car making repeated late-night trips to Chester. 

Justin Hayhoe, prosecuting, told the court: 'Examination of his computers revealed this was a man who had a fascination with Chester and areas frequented by students.

'He seemed to target women wearing high heels, short skirts, short dresses or short shorts.

'When he was interviewed he said he, 'Absolutely admired a great pair of legs and a short skirt. The fitter the better'.'

Internet searches by Dwyer centred on Chester student accommodation, spy cameras, how best to record in low-light and areas of Chester covered by CCTV cameras.

He had also done similar searches on students and student areas in Sheffield and the Stoke area of Staffordshire. 

The court heard he carried out his crimes over a seven-month period between October 2013 and the date of his arrest. 

Desperate measures: Dwyer went to extreme lengths to avoid press photographers, sneaking out from a hearing last Friday through an emergency exit - which had the consequence of setting off the fire alarm

He had approached one 'squatting' victim while and told her he was investigating a crime so he could film between her legs with a camera stashed in his police uniform pocket.

Other footage he took included filming up the skirts of his victims in takeaways, standing below women queuing up the steps of a nightclub and gangs of girls queuing for taxis.

The court heard he committed the filming offences by using distraction techniques and he would often pretend to be taking on a mobile telephone.

On other occasions he would engage women in conversation, asking to get past them or suggesting he was a first aider who could assist them when they were intoxicated and had been vomiting.

Mr Hayhoe said Dwyer would often follow and film women who had been drinking and were vulnerable.

He added: 'In relation to the women he selected, they were all young women, out on nights out, they were expecting they could go out, enjoy an evening out and not have their privacy invaded by this man filming up their skirts.'

Dwyer's activities first came to the attention of police after reports of a man acting suspiciously at 1am in the Green Lane area of Chester.

The defendant did not tell the officers called to the scene he was a fellow policeman and said he was researching properties in the area to let out to students.

But police later found out he repeatedly visited the student areas of Chester - always late at night or the early hours of the morning.

In May last year he was stopped again by police officers in Chester who were suspicious about what he was up to.

Police searched his Renault Megane and found 'lubricant and clothing' but Dwyer, who said he was a council worker was again allowed to go on his way.

Mr Thompson, defending, said Dwyer's behaviour was 'sad and pathetic'.

Detective Inspector Chris Packer, from the force's Counter Corruption Unit, said: 'These videos were filmed without the knowledge of his victims, showing a complete lack of regard for their privacy, for his own sexual pleasure.

'The conduct of former PC Kevin Dwyer fell well short of what is expected of a police officer.

'Police officers, staff and the communities of Greater Manchester would be appalled by his actions, which detract from the hard work that our officers and staff do on a daily basis.

'GMP expects the very highest standards of all its officers and staff. They should be honest and act with integrity and should not compromise or abuse their position.'
