A teenage I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here fan has been hit with a £1,158 phone bill after voting for her favourite star Lucy Pargeter more than 2,000 times.

The the horror of her mother, superfan Nicole Hassall, 18, racked up the huge bill in just six hours as she bid to keep her idol in the jungle.

The teenager made a staggering 2,316 calls to the ITV show’s 50p premium
rate number in support of the Emmerdale star - unaware her phone bill 
would sky-rocket as a result.

Now her mother Eileen, 62, has been forced to use £250 earmarked for Nicole’s Christmas presents to pay off the charges. 

She has now warned parents to be vigilant if their children become hooked on primetime TV shows which encourage viewers to vote.

She said network provider Orange did not notify them until Saturday morning that Nicole had logged so many calls after Wednesday night’s edition of the show.

Account holder Mrs Hassall then received a text warning her of a £350 bill, shortly followed by a further message which put the amount at £621.

Furious Mrs Hassall, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, then rang Orange only to be told the actual amount was an eye-watering £1,158.

She has now called for tighter controls on dialling premium-rate numbers from mobiles and questioned how her daughter was able to rack up such a huge bill.

She said: 'It just kept going up and up. She had no idea what she was doing.

'Her phone said she still had minutes and texts left.

'I’m questioning that she could have made that many calls.

'We watched the show together and then went to bed.

'I didn’t think anything of it until three days later we got this text saying my bill was higher than normal.

'It’s absolutely disgusting that Orange didn’t let me know what was happening.

'It’s completely out of the ordinary. She’s never done this before.

'There’s no way I’ll be able to pay this.'

Nicole, who has mild learning difficulties, said she was unaware the bill would be so high as she voted for Lucy to stay in the jungle.

She said: 'I did vote but I really wanted Lucy or Kian from Westlife to win.

'I had no idea the bill would be this much.

'I’m really upset.'

Orange said it took measures to avoid high charges and had waived half of the outstanding £908 bill.

A spokesman added: 'We sympathise with Ms Hassall and have offered a 50 per cent reduction on her bill as a gesture of goodwill.

'To help customers avoid high charges from voting lines we terminated each of the calls after six seconds.

'However, as the customer in this instance continued to call the number for several hours additional charges were incurred.'

An ITV spokesman said: 'In the voting terms and conditions it says voters should only vote with the bill payer’s permission. We are happy to explore this issue if we are provided with more information.'

Lucy Pargeter, who plays Chastity ‘Chas’ Dingle in the ITV soap, came third in this year’s series.

She surprised viewers by beating TOWIE star Joey Essex - who was a hot favourite to win at the start of the show - only for Westlife singer Kian Egan to eventually take the King Of The Jungle Crown.
