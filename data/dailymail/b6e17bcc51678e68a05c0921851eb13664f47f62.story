A former councillor was trampled to death by a stampeding herd of cattle as he walked through a field in Derbyshire with his wife and two dogs.

Peter Jakeman, 62, who was visiting the area from his home town in Callington, Cornwall, was walking across a field with his wife Hilary, 56, on the Okeover Estate in Ashbourne when the tragedy unfolded.

Mr Jakeman, described as 'one of nature's gentlemen', was treated for blood loss and chest injuries after the stampede took place.

Peter Jakeman, 62, from Callington, Cornwall, was walking across a field in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, when he was trampled to death by a herd of cows

He was then airlifted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire by the Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland air ambulance, but could not be saved.

The Health and Safety executive has now launched an investigation into Mr Jakeman's death. Police say his death is not being treated as suspicious.

A spokesman for the estate said they were 'horrified' by the 'terrible accident'.

Mr Jakeman served on Callington Town Council from December 2004 to January 2006 and was also a chairman of the bench at Plymouth Magistrates’ Court.

One neighbour told how retired Mr Jakeman and his wife had gone off with their trailer but were due to be back this Sunday.

Councillor Jeremy Gist, who knew Mr Jakeman well, said: 'He wasn’t just a colleague, I regarded Peter and his wife as friends.

'He was a very active member of the community but not only that, he was a genuinely good man,what I would have called one of nature’s gentlemen.

'He was a talented man, if he did something you knew it would be done right.

The incident took place on the Okeover Estate, the site of the Grade II listed Okeover Hall, pictured. A spokesman for the estate said they were 'horrified' by the 'terrible accident'

'There was no beating about the bush with Peter, if it was right it was right and if it wasn’t he would have told you.

'That was the sort of character that made him a good councillor.'

Neighbour Terence Buckler said: 'They were the archetypal retired couple who loved to keep fit.

'Peter would spend hours in his front garden which they had recently done up.

'They
 loved their dogs and we'd often see them walking with them. They had 
gone off with their dogs and their trailer which was fairly new.

'They
 loved it as they could go to a campsite and leave the trailer while 
they went off in their car. They were due to be back this Sunday, it's 
very sad.'

Mr Jakeman, who was walking in the field with his wife and two dogs at the time, was airlifted to hospital by the Derbyshire Leicestershire and Rutland air ambulance after suffering from blood loss and chest injuries

He was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire but could not be saved

Neighbour Faye Mowle-Haimes said: 'I’m shocked. I know he used to walk a lot with his wife and he had dogs, cocker spaniels.'

And Councillor Rich Lumley said: 'He had the interests of the town at heart and was very committed in the short time he was on the town council.'

Sylvia Palmer said: 'He was a really lovely man. He loved the outdoors - him and Hilary would often go out on their bikes for long distances and days out, they were very active.

'I'm sure they were doing lots of walking and cycling while they were away as that's what they really enjoyed. I can't believe it - it's so tragic.'

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police said: 'Emergency services were called to reports of an injured man in a field off the A52 Leek Road in Upper Mayfield at around 9.05am on Wednesday May 14.

'It was reported the man had been injured by stampeding cows within the field.

Mr Jakeman was a magistrate at Plymouth Magistrates' Court and also served as a councillor on Callington Town Council between 2004 and 2006

'He was taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire but sadly died in hospital later that morning.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious and inquiries are being over seen by the Health and Safety Executive.'

Advice has now been issued to ramblers and tourists in the wake of Mr Jakeman’s death.

On average, one person per year is killed by cattle in the UK, with nearly 500 hurt in attacks by animals from 2005 to 2013.

It is thought attacks usually take place due to dogs being present or calves being in the field when walkers approach.

The British Mountaineering Council said dogs should be kept on a lead and, if cattle appear unsettled, walkers should move away as carefully and quietly as possible.

A spokesman said if people feel threatened they should let go of their dog’s lead - if they are holding one - and try not to make any noise or fast movements.

A statement from the estate said: 'We are horrified by this terrible accident and our thoughts and prayers are with the family of Peter Jakeman.'
