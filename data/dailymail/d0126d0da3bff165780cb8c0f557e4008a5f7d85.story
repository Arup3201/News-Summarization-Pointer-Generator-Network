Arsenal have made a move for Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos.

The 26-year-old centre back only moved to Dortmund last summer from Werder Bremen but now has to compete with Mats Hummels and Neven Subotic, who are fit again this year plus former Arsenal target Matthias Ginter who joined in July.

Dortmund paid £7.5million for Papastathopoulos but want close to £20m now as the window is so close to shutting.

Arsenal are understood to have offered £12m plus add-ons.

Although the Greece defender seems like a money-maker on shirt letters in the club shop, he goes by the name of Sokratis owing to he fact his full name doesn't fit comfortably on his jersey.

He is physical and quick and has a decent track record having also played for AEK Athens, AC Milan and collecting more than 50 caps for his country.

Arsenal are also entering the decisive stages for the possible signing of midfielder Adrien Rabiot from PSG.

Arsenal have had an offer turned down already with PSG demanding £16m for a the teenager who has one year left on contract.

Manchester United scouts were among those at Alfreton Town on Wednesday as Portugal U17s played Italy U17s.

There wasn't much to shout about in a 0-0 draw but Portugal captain Moreto Cassama, a right-footed midfielder from Porto, caught they eye with some good touches and movement. Portugal also have young Arsenal prospect Jonatas Centeno in their squad. They play England U17s on Friday at Chesterfield.

Teenage kicks: Arsenal are also closing in on PSG midfielder Adrien Rabiot 

Veronique Rabiot, the player’s mother and agent, is due in London on Thursday for discussions with Roma considered Arsenal's main rivals. Juventus have an offer in place to take him next summer.

Rabiot, 19, spent a few months training with Manchester City as a 15-year-old and can play defensive, attacking midfield and on the left but his progress at PSG has been stymied by the array of stars ahead of him.

Norwich City have made an offer for Arsenal defender Ignasi Miquel. The Spanish prospect has struggled to break through at The Emirates and is in the final year of his contract. The 21-year-old, who stands at 6ft 4in, had a seven game spell on loan at Leicester City last season.

Norwich have also signed Viadis Odjidja from Club Brugge after he flew over for talks yesterday.

Sportsmail reported Norwich's interest at the weekend and terms have been agreed on a three year deal.

The 25-year-old midfielder had seemed reluctant to go at first amid concerns he did not wish to play in the Championship but after a few days' thought he has been convinced it is a step in the right direction.

Odjidja was a target for Everton 18 months ago and Aston Villa last season.

Carlisle manager Graham Kavanagh has revealed former England striker Emile Heskey has turned down his offer to join the club.

Heskey, 36, is a free agent after a two-year spell in Australia with Newcastle Jets, but opted not to team back up with Kavanagh who played in the same Wigan team as Heskey. Kavanagh said: 'I tried to get Emile in. I played with him at Wigan and I know what he is all about.

'Unfortunately he turned it down as I think he wants to be playing in the Championship or going back abroad.'

Stefan Maierhofer, the 6ft 7in Austrian striker who helped Millwall stay up last season, is looking for a return to London and Fulham are interested.

Coach Felix Magath knows Maierhofer well from various spells in Germany and Austria and believes he could add a different dimension to Fulham's attack. The 32-year-old is a free agent and had also attracted interest from Crystal Palace. 

He had hoped to return to Millwall this season but failed to agree terms with the club.

Liverpool are not pursuing interest in Barcelona's Alex Song.

Reports have again linked the former Arsenal midfielder with a move to Anfield but manager Brendan Rodgers is happy to let the opportunity pass with Marseille keen to conclude a deal. 

Rodgers believes he is almost done spending. The one option that may return is that of a goalkeeper. Liverpool have not followed up interest in Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Ramos of Sampdoria but have considered others in Europe as they look to increase competition for Simon Mignolet.

Leeds United are in discussions to sign Paraguay striker Brian Montenegro.

The 21-year-old may strike a chord with West Ham fans as he was with them on loan in 2011-12. Remember? No?

He joined West Ham on August 29, 2011 where he signed a season-long loan contract saying: 'I am very excited to come here and play in England, especially for a club like West Ham. I am hoping to get a chance to show the fans what I can do.'

Montenegro's debut game came on January 8 2012 in a 1–0 FA Cup third round away defeat by Sheffield Wednesday and that was that. At the end of the season, a new contract was not agreed and he returned to Paraguay.

He has since played for another four clubs but that hasn't dissuaded Massimo Cellino, who is ready to give Montenegro another chance.

Newcastle central defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has agreed to join Marseille on loan after finding a salary agreement with the Ligue 1 side. Marseille have offered a loan with an option to buy and it is up to Newcastle to decide now. They have Mike Williamson suspended while Roma have an interest in Davide Santon.

Newcastle have still to finish buying themselves with QPR's Loic Remy and Alexandre Lacazette of Lyon still in their sights.
