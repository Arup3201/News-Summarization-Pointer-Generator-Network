It has been many years since Blackpool was the jewel of UK seaside resorts.

But its fading image has taken another battering, as its beaches have today been named and shamed, once again, among Britain’s worst.

Experts warned that ‘no-swimming’ signs may soon be erected in Blackpool and elsewhere along the Lancashire coastline unless the water quality is urgently improved.

In 2015 stringent European rules will see the warning signs put up if a beach consistently fails an inspection.

The latest failure for Blackpool was issued by the Marine Conservation Society in its Good Beach Guide and will undoubtedly alarm tourism chiefs in the area.

Of the 25 beaches the campaign group failed, six were on the Lancashire coastline, including two in Blackpool.

Robert Keirle, pollution programme manager for the campaign group, said: ‘This problem goes back for as long as I can remember and I’ve been coming here for 20-odd years.

‘This is a lesson Blackpool is just not learning or a message they are not heeding. I keep explaining what the problems are and how they need to be addressed and we are just not progressing.

‘By 2015 the standards for water quality are being tightened. If they are failing now they won’t stand a chance of passing by then.

‘And if they fail the bathing water quality inspection over five consecutive years they will be forced to erect signs warning tourists not to go into the water.

‘They might as well flush the millions they have spent regenerating the area down the sewer.’

Mr Keirle said the local council had failed to accept the ‘magnitude’ of the problem and together with the environment agency and local water companies had become embroiled in ‘a circle of blame’.

‘This has been dragging on for a very long time and it’s the entire Lancashire coast that urgently needs attention,’ he said.

‘It’s consistently the worst-performing part of the UK – not just England, but the whole of the UK.

‘We have isolated resorts elsewhere that fail every so often but we are consistently failing an entire coastline.’

Overall, however, more than two-thirds of UK beaches surveyed last summer – 516 out of 754 – were recommended for ‘excellent’ water quality. This is an 8 per cent rise on the previous year’s figures, and the best set of results in 25 years of the guide.

But the MCS warned that the heavy rainfall of the past week could see raw sewage from overflow pipes enter bathing areas.

The North East was the best-performing region, with 53 out of 64 beaches recommended for excellent water quality. The North West was worst with only eight out of 37 beaches recommended.

In the South East 94 out of 126 beaches were recommended while 154 out of 193 in the South West were praised.
