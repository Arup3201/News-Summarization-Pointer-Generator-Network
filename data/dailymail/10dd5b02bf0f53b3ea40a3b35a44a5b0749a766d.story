A Washington man accused of plowing his souped-up truck through a crowd of bar-goers, killing a man, insists to police that he only had one beer beforehand — but his truck was taken over by demons and took him on an 'amusement ride from hell.'

Dustin F. Brown, 28, told cops that he desperately wanted to stop his Ford F-350 as it fishtailed out of control on May 26 while people in Bellingham left downtown bars.

Four pedestrians were hit. One, Dragan Skrobonja, 37, was killed.

Brown, whose blood-alcohol content was three times the legal limit, told cops the truck was 'literally possessed.'

'I was along for the ride,' Brown told a detective hours after the accident, according to investigative records released to The Bellingham Herald under a public records request.

'I
 was bleeding everywhere, and my glasses — I couldn't really see, I was 
just on a terrible — an amusement ride from hell, pretty much.'

Brown insisted he was being honest, and told police he desperately wanted to stop but the throttle had stuck.

In the aftermath of the accident, a
 crowd surrounded the truck and pulled the driver out, detaining him as 
officers arrived, police said.

Many people had been out celebrating the 
city's annual Ski to Sea race, a seven-sport relay race that covers 93 
miles from Mount Baker to Bellingham Bay.

Brown
 faces nine felony charges of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault.

Hours before the accident, police say, he sent a series of text messages to friends saying he was too drunk to drive.

The records say Brown had been drinking 
at the Up & Up tavern in Bellingham, about 20 miles south of the Canadian border, when he contacted two friends 
searching for a place to stay.

'So I'm downtown and shouldnt drive,' Brown wrote one at 9:36pm. 'Wanna volunteer to house me?'

'Shoot can't help you senor,' she answered.

He texted her again just after 10pm: 'Im never lookin for help ... Except now... But ok.'

Thirty seconds later Brown texted the second, saying he was intoxicated and 'dont wanna drive home.'

'I'm headed down to Bellevue now,' she replied. 'Otherwise I would invite you to crash at my place.'

Instead, witnesses said, Brown continued drinking and buying pitchers of beer for others. One, Jeremy Evans, 25, said Brown seemed extremely intoxicated and spilled beer as he poured it into his glass.

In an interview at a hospital three hours after the crash, Detective Pauline Renick asked Brown if he had been drinking.

'I had a few drinks,' he said, at first, according to a transcript.

But when pressed for details, Brown's recollection changed. He insisted he'd only had one pint. He explained how he bought a pitcher, poured one glass for himself and gave the rest to two girls he'd just met. Brown drank no other alcohol, he said, before getting into his truck at 1:30 am.

The detective said that didn't jibe with the results of his breath test, and that he still smelled of alcohol.

A mechanic consulted by police reported that it wasn't possible for the throttle to stick the way Brown described and that the accelerator worked fine.

One witness, Tyler Dixon, told police that toward the end of the truck's rampage, it hit two more parked cars and went into reverse and then drive again. Dixon said he took advantage of the pause to jump onto the truck's step bar, grab the driver through the window and pummel him. The driver slumped to the side, and the truck stopped against the barrier. Dixon suffered a fractured knuckle.

Brown, 28, remains in Whatcom County Jail on $500,000 bail. Brown's next court hearing has been set for Sept. 10, with a tentative trial date of Sept. 22.

His public defender, Darrin Hall, said Skrobonja's death has been difficult for everybody, including Brown.

'It haunts him every day,' Hall said, 'because people's lives are ruined when lives are lost.'
