As tensions rise in the replacement referee debacle in the NFL, some comedians can't help but have a laugh at the expense of the NFL's inept officials.

The videos have been tearing up the internet as uproar grows over the replacements and what has been seen by analysts and former players as unbelievable blown calls.

One of them borrows the sample from Flo Rida's summer anthem Whistle, with a parody video of the same name.

YouTube sensation: Parodies like the 'Whistle' video, seen above, have been tearing up the internet as uproar grows over replacement referees and what has been seen as a series of blown calls

Poking fun: A 'referee' does a Major League Baseball 'safe' sign during a hilarious parody borrowing music from Flo Rida's 'Whistle'

The lyrics go like this: 'Is it a fumble or a dropped pass/Is it cool to pull a facemask/It may take me a little longer/To get every call a little wronger.'

The song is the latest catchy parody from Network of Champions (NOC), the same group that gave the world 'Call Me Lochte' (to the tune of Call Me Maybe) at the height of the Olympic rivalry between swimmers Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps.

And speaking of Call Me Maybe, the Carly Rae Jepsen tune is the basis for yet another song poking fun at the replacement refs.

'Call It Maybe' features the lyrics: 'Hey, I just met you/that play was crazy/what’s his number?/ I’ll call it maybe.'

Says it all: Two replacement referees came up with two opposite calls after Seattle Seahawks receiver made a catch in the end zone Monday night. Most observers say a Green Bay defender had the ball first

Botched: The referee on the left called the play a touchdown for Seattle, even though most fans believe Green Bay had intercepted the ball. The ref on the right called for a stoppage of play

The song was written and performed by Seth Haake, and first played on the KFAN FM 100.3 in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week.

Across the league, players admit the state of play has changed under the referees who aren't as observant and lack the authority of the full-time officials.

The controversy appeared to hit its breaking point on Monday night, when the Seattle Seahawks beat the Green Bay Packers on the final play of the game that was highly questionable.

Packers guard TJ Lang was especially furious, tweeting: 'Got f***ed by the refs.. Embarrassing. Thanks nfl' and 'F*** it NFL.. Fine me and use the money to pay the regular refs.'

Fury: Denver Broncos coach John Fox screamed at officials last Monday when they wouldn't allow him to contest a penalty

'These games are a joke,' Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman tweeted.

'I love this league and love the game of football, but tonight’s debacle hurts me greatly. This is NOT the league we’re supposed to represent,' New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees wrote.

Even President Obama took a break from his presidential duties to weigh in on the debate, saying via Twitter: 'NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hope the refs' lockout is settled soon.'

The situation has gotten so bad that team coaches are also being hit with punishments over their response to what they perceive as a blown call.

Broncos coach John Fox was fined $30,000 on Monday and defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio $25,000 for verbal abuse of the officials during a Monday night game against Atlanta on September 17.

Outrage: Packers players surrounded a referee after they were 'robbed' of a victory against the Seahawks on Monday

Angry: Packers guard TJ Lang was not the only player who publicly complained about the replacement referees -- but he was likely to most explicit

More fines are likely for New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, and perhaps for others after a comedy of errors this past weekend.

Fox and Del Rio were hit for their sideline histrionics, particularly when Fox was told he couldn't challenge a call of 12 men on the field - he was correct that he could challenge, although replays showed the Broncos were guilty.

Before grabbing the arm of an official, Belichick wanted to know why Ravens kicker Justin Tucker's field goal was called good in Baltimore's 31-30 victory Sunday night.

He couldn't tell from his angle on the sideline, Belichick claimed.

'So when the game was over, I went out and I was really looking for an explanation from the officials as to whether the play was under review,' he said, 'and I did try to get the official's attention as he was coming off the field to ask that, but I really wasn't able to do that.'

Penalties: Patriots head coach Bill Belichick will likely be fined after he grabbed a replacement official and demanded to know why a Ravens field goal was called 'good'
