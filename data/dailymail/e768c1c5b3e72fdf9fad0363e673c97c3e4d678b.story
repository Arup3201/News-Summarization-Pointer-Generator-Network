She has been hailed as a worldwide fashion icon with millions of women rushing out to emulate her style every day.

And now it seems that even her husband William is taking style tips from his fashion-forward wife after he stepped out wearing a matching pair of trainers to hers.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were out in force today to support the Paralympic Games- of which they are both ambassadors- wearing the Team GB Adidas Supernova Glide 4 Running Trainers.

The vivid red/metallic silver trainers are available for £87.11 and Kate was the first of the young Royals to get her hands on a pair over the Olympics a few weeks ago.

Kate and William cheered on Team GB at 
both the cycling and goalball and looked like the idyllic sporty couple 
in their matching patriotic Team GB polo shirts.

Despite a late night at the 
spectacular Paralympic Opening Ceremony the couple looked fresh-faced as they cheered on competitors at the 
velodrome for the cycling event on day one of the Paralympic Games.

The
 two cheered as they watched British gold medal favourite Sarah Storey 
break a world record in the individual pursuit at the packed Stratford 
venue - before joining the Duchess of Wessex and her daughter Lady 
Louise Windsor in a slow motion Mexican Wave, much to the delight of the
 noisy 6,000-strong audience.

In contrast, the Cambridges had earlier visited the Copper Box venue to watch goalball - parts of which are played in silence.

At the velodrome, Kate and William were joined by the Deputy Chairman of British Rowing, Annamarie Phelps, Lady Louise Windsor and Sophie, Countess of Wessex as they took their seats in the stands and cheered on the cyclists.

She and William both showed their 
support with patriotic outfits, Kate opted for a red Team GB polo neck, 
whilst her husband went for blue. She paired the polo with a casual pair of navy jeans and wore her hair in her trademark curled look.

The couple seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the first of the events they are set to attend over the next 11 days as they studied the programmes and chatted with their fellow onlookers.

Kate displayed her close relationship with the Queen's granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor as she leaned in to talk to the young Royal during the event.

Kate, William and Harry,  all of whom are official 
Paralympics GB ambassadors, will watch three days of sport over the 11 days but are 
expected to miss the closing ceremony.

In front of the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge, Storey clocked three minutes 32.170 seconds to advance to the
 gold medal ride-off of the three-kilometre event, with compatriot 
Crystal Lane progressing to the race for bronze by qualifying fourth in 
3mins 59.220secs.

Storey 
has won seven Paralympic titles since making her debut in Barcelona as a
 swimmer in 1992 and is aiming to add to her collection in London.

It was the 34-year-old sixth Paralympic Games, and looks set to be her most successful yet.

At the Olympics, all three were 
‘parachuted’ into the most sought-after events, sometimes just minutes 
before the British team or athletes won their gold medals, before moving
 on to the next big event of the day.

A Palace spokesman blamed the royals’
 work commitments and said that William and Kate would also be busy 
preparing for their tour of the Far East and the Pacific, which departs 
on Monday, September 10, the day after the closing ceremony.

While William is at work as an RAF search and rescue pilot, the Duchess will also watch swimming and athletics.

Prince
 Harry will attend the swimming next Monday, before visiting Paralympics
 GB House. He will be the only one of the three to visit the official 
headquarters of the Paralympic Games, compared to visits by all three 
during the Olympics.

Last night, Kate dazzled at the Opening Ceremony as she joined Queen 
Elizabeth, Prince Edward, his wife Sophie the 
Countess of Wessex and Prince William as well as David and Samantha Cameron.

Kate
looked elegant in a recycled coat dress by DAY Birger et Mikkelsen 
featuring gold embroidery, which she teamed with her favourite nude £185
LK Bennett heels and a sparkling clutch.

The Duchess has worn the dress on at 
least two previous occasions, including Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall's
wedding last year and also in 2006 at the nuptials of Laura Parker 
Bowles at St Cyriac's Church in Lacock, Wiltshire
