Paula Radcliffe has revealed she did not know whom to trust during the difficult times in her career.

The women's marathon world record holder said she often felt lonely when she was recovering from injury.

The 40-year-old said she discovered whom she could rely on in the wake of the Athens Olympics in 2004. She had been expected to win gold in Greece, but, affected by injury and illness, ended up dropping out of the race and sitting on the curb in floods of tears.

'You can feel as though there's not that many people who really understand the situation,' Radcliffe said in an interview with the BBC.

'After Athens was probably a difficult time because then it was really knowing who you could talk to and open up to and that's when you really learn who your best friends are and who the people who really you can just open up to (are) and they're not going to go to any media or abuse that trust.

'You're able to share your inner thoughts, inner concerns and inner worries with them. I was really lucky with Gary (her husband) and with my family and coach around me that I had those people that I could just turn to and open up to.

'That's when you really do appreciate that because I think it can be a very lonely place, not so much when things are going well, but when you hit difficulties and you're still at peak performance, in that position where people think, 'They don't need anybody, they don't need advice, they don't need help'. But actually you do and you don't always know where to turn to.'

Radcliffe revealed her loneliest time in the sport came in 2003 when she suffered a shin injury in the wake of her marathon world record.

'When you're injured is probably a time when you do feel lonely in being alone with the injury and with the thoughts, wanting to be back running, be healthy again, but not being able to get there,' she said.

'Probably the worst time for that would have been in 2003 when I'd set the world record in London. When I tried to get back into training I had quite a serious shin injury inflammation that just kept dragging on.

'I basically ended up sitting for about nine weeks in Limerick in a flat there in between getting treatment and literally just icing and icing and icing and trying to get it better and it just kept coming back with the inflammation at the end of every day. That was a pretty lonely frustrating time.'Â
