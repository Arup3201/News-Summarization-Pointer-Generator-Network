A reckless driver was caught eating a bowl of cereal in his lap while driving one-handed through a busy city centre.

The driver wearing a blue shirt was spotted casually using one-hand to control the car as he overtook traffic and drove at 35mph in Edinburgh.

He even tips the bowl to his mouth with his hands to drink the last dregs of milk when he stops at traffic lights.

The man was so transfixed by his cereal he didn’t even notice an exasperated cyclist had captured the whole thing on his helmet camera.

The cyclist, who posted the video on YouTube, can be heard shouting 'What the f***' at the driver who briefly looks up before putting down his bowl and driving off.

The video received an angry response from the site's users who said that the driver should be reported.

Drivers who eat and drink at the wheel can receive three penalty points and a fine of up to £1,000.

Police in Edinburgh previously said that the incident had not been reported to them.

But they have now launched an investigation into the driver's actions.

A spokesman said: 'Certainly this would be frowned upon.

'Drivers need to be paying attention to the road in front of them and not to their breakfast bowl.'

He added: 'We will review this footage and conduct an enquiry to identify the driver.

'Anyone who can assist police with their investigation is asked to come forward.

'Motorists are reminded to ensure they are in full control of their vehicle when driving and should not engage in any activities that can cause distraction or result in a loss of control.

'Anyone found driving inappropriately would be dealt with accordingly.'

A spokesman for the AA also criticised the driver.

He said: 'It's pretty stupid. It's unbelievable really. For some people their car in a way becomes their home, and they behave in such a way that they would in their house.

'People just don't seem to have the willpower not to do things they know are wrong, link turning their phone off, or not eating a sandwich while driving.

'It's a must have must do attitude.'
