A University of Oklahoma student has claimed today that the sick racist chant that brought national disgust on the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity is a longstanding tradition among brothers at the organization.

A student spoke out to the Today show to say that she had heard the 'there will never be a n***** in SAE' chant from members of the fraternity at least two years ago and that the brothers all thought it was a gas.

'I would definitely say this is not an isolated incident,' the student, who did not want to be named, told Today.

'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma

Cut it off! As one frat brother gleefully sings a racist chant, another steps in and tries to cut off recording of the shameful incident

'It was really offensive to sit there and listen to that especially because they would just chant it and then laugh after and they thought it was funny.'

Meanwhile, the national SAE headquarters announced that it was investigating reports of other incidents at other chapters across the country.

The fraternity traces its founding back to 1856 at the University of Alabama - before the Civil War an the end of slavery. It has 218 active chapters, more than 15,000 student members and 325,000 alumni.

The fraternity has chapters at the most prestigious universities in the country, including Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT and Duke, as well as some of the largest universities - including Texas A&M, Ohio State and Penn State.

The SAE fraternity was disbanded by the national headquarters and banned from campus by University of Oklahoma officials

'Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters staff and leaders, and each of those instances will be investigated for further action,' the fraternity said. 

However, the fraternity - which is now headquartered at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois - denied claims that the racist song sung by University of Oklahoma brothers was a widespread tradition.

'Some reports have alleged that the racist chant in the video is part of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon tradition, which is completely false. The fraternity has a number of songs that have be,' the statement said. 

The chant, which surfaced Sunday in a nine-second video, appears to be a well-known song to the fraternity brothers. As some members began singing it, others can be seen standing up to join in. 

SAE officials quickly disbanded the Oklahoma chapter of the fraternity and launched their own investigation following outrage over the clip.
