The European Space Agency's Sun-watching Proba-2 satellite has sent back incredible footage of three partial solar eclipses as seen from Earth's orbit.

During a total solar eclipse, like the one seen from Australia on Tuesday night, the Moon moves between the Earth and the Sun, its alignment such that it appears large enough to block out the Sun's rays.

Since Proba-2 orbits Earth about 14.5 times per day, it can dip in and out of the Moon’s shadow around the time of a solar eclipse.

satellite. The images taken by the satellite's SWAP imager, which snaps the 
Sun in ultraviolet light

Won't you come: The UV images reveal stormy 
active regions on the Sun's face, including sunspots, the roots of some 
large solar flares and coronal mass ejections that are occasionally 
directed towards Earth

And wash away the rain? Since Proba-2 orbits Earth 
about 14.5 times per day, it can dip in and out of the Moon's shadow

The constant change in viewing angle of Proba-2 meant that the satellite passed through the shadow three times during Tuesday's eclipse.

However, as the Sun was never completely covered up from Proba-2’s vantage point, each eclipse was only partial.

The video was produced from images taken by Proba-2’s SWAP imager, which snaps the Sun in ultraviolet light revealing stormy active regions on the Sun’s face, including sunspots, the roots of some large solar flares and coronal mass ejections that are occasionally directed towards Earth.

The apparent noise in the movie is caused by high energy particles hitting Proba-2's electronics as the spacecraft passes through the South Atlantic Anomaly.

The dimming in the movie is an effect as part of the satellite's orbit passes through the shadow of the Earth.

Joe Zender, Proba-2 mission manager, 
said: 'The satellite also spent hours collecting data of the solar 
environment further away from the Sun before and after the main eclipse 
event, providing context for the ground-based observations.'

From boats bobbing on the Great Barrier Reef to hot air balloons hovering over the rainforest, and the hilltops and beaches in between, tens of thousands of scientists, tourists and amateur astronomers watched in awe as the sun, moon and Earth aligned and plunged northern Australia into darkness.

Forecasters were predicting cloudy skies around dawn Wednesday, but it didn't materialise, allowing stargazers to experience it unhindered.

The eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of the Australian state, with totality occurring at 06.38 on November 14 (20.38 GMT).

'Immediately before, I was thinking, "Are we gonna see this?" And we just had a fantastic display - it was just beautiful,' said Terry Cuttle of the Astronomical Association of Queensland, who has seen a dozen total solar eclipses over the years.

'And right after it finished, the clouds came back again.

'It really adds to the drama of it.'

Observing in visible light extremely 
close to the solar surface is only possible from the ground during 
eclipses when the bright solar disc is temporarily obscured. This 
briefly exposes the Sun’s bright atmosphere, or corona, and the red glow
of the chromosphere.

'Combining visible light observations with the extreme ultraviolet images from Proba-2 gives us a unique opportunity to access difficult-to-see regions of the Sun at different wavelengths, during a rare event such as a total solar eclipse,' Mr Zender added.

Observers on the ground watched in awe as darkness swept across the land for a little over 2 minutes. The eclipse began at 05.45 in the far north of Queensland, with totality occurring at 06.38 on November 14 (20.38 on November 13 in GMT).

Proba-2 scientist Anik De Groof watched the event with thousands of others along the Australian coast at Palm Cove.

'We got all a bit nervous when after sunrise the partially eclipsed Sun was covered by a big cloud, but 5 minutes before totality, the cloud dissolved and we could watch "Baily’s beads" form – the effect where beads of sunlight shine through the rugged lunar landscape,' said Mr De Groof.

'At totality we could see the red chromosphere and the corona in the most beautiful conditions – it was fantastic!'

Dramatic: Near totality is seen during the solar eclipse at Palm Cove, Australia, where thousands of eclipse-watchers gathered to view the phenomenon, the first in Australia in a decade

Australians will have another chance to see a solar eclipse in May 2013, although because the Moon will be slightly further away from the Earth, it won’t block the whole Sun, resulting in an ‘annular eclipse’.

Europe will have to wait until November 2013 before the opportunity arises to see a partial solar eclipse across much of the south.

Meanwhile, ESA’s fleet of Sun-watching spacecraft will continue to monitor the Sun’s stormy behaviour as it unleashes its plasma load out into space and towards Earth.

Scientists will get even closer to the action in 2017 with the launch of Solar Orbiter, which will travel to observe the Sun from a daring distance of just 26million miles - that's inside the orbit of planet Mercury, our system's innermost planet.
