Day One: Manchester United sign Radamel Falcao, one of the world’s most potent centre-forwards, in a deal worth so many millions nobody seems quite sure exactly how many, but everyone agrees he will play up front.

Day Two: Former England and United defender Paul Parker pipes up in an online blog to brand him “awful”, criticise the size of his salary and demand he is dropped, while Southampton reject and Norway defender Vegard Forren calls him “chubby” in an interview on Norwegian TV.

Day Three: Marks his first game as the official captain of the team with a dour and low-key friendly against Norway in front of the smallest crowd ever to witness an England international at the new Wembley Stadium.

Captain's call: Wayne Rooney scored a penalty on his first appearance since taking over as England skipper

Backs turned: Rooney and his team-mates were watched by a record-low crowd at the new Wembley Stadium

Wayne Rooney’s first three days as captain of England weren’t going according to plan, until the 68th minute when he buried the penalty which gave his team the lead.

He punched the air with the sort of ferocity he might have reserved for Parker or Forren and that was that. Off he went, hopeful that here was a goal to end the idea that the captain’s armband has carried with it a mild curse since David Beckham passed on the responsibility.

There was Steven Gerrard’s miscued header in Sao Paulo, Rio Ferdinand’s knee injury in South Africa and John Terry’s… Well, there was John Terry.

If week two starts in the same way for Rooney in Switzerland, England will be in real trouble.

Roy Hodgson cannot contemplate defeat in Basle on Monday. Not because it will ruin their chances of qualification. It won’t.

There’s no way England can fail to reach the finals in France in 2016, but this team is in desperate need of signs of encouragement to be sure they are to rebuild with any confidence after the World Cup debacle and the new skipper is to achieve the place in history he craves.

Off the field, Rooney had performed his captaincy duties well. He stood at the front of the line, sang the anthem, swapped the mini-flags without trouble and witnessed the coin tossing ceremony. No sweat. 

He had been relaxed and good humoured as he joined Hodgson for a press conference on the eve of the game, wise-cracking about the manager’s physical condition. Wazza resisted the urge to respond to Forren’s remarks like Gazza once did, with a four-letter message to the people of Norway.

Forren, a Southampton reject, who signed for the Saints and returned across the North Sea without appearing for a single second, would no doubt have his comeuppance on the pitch.

Except he didn’t. On the field, it all seemed a little more arduous. This remember is Rooney’s natural habitat. He is a playground player. All the pomp and ceremony is not his cup of tea, but let him loose with a ball and watch him go.

If only. Early on, he misplaced passes and his touch was heavy, while his partnership with Daniel Sturridge has still to click. Some strikers seem to have a telepathic connection. Some do not. Although that is not necessarily Rooney’s fault.

Frustration: England were held for much of the game and struggled to break through Noway's defence

The chemistry between them best summed up when Sturridge, looking to take a free-kick quickly having been fouled in the centre of the pitch, thought he had seen a Rooney run and clipped a pass over the Norway defence.

The trouble was there was no run. Rooney had barely moved. It was more of the maddening frustration witnessed in the World Cup.

Rooney’s best work came when he dropped deeper, turning on the ball in midfield and launching long passes. He appreciates the angles of the game when tucks into those areas. He tried to make things happen in a game which threatened to seize up at times.

He remains a good player, but he is less often these days one who can inspire. England had the best of the early chances but it was Raheem Sterling, dashing inside from the left who lifted the supporters from their slumber.

Backwards step: Rooney’s best work came when he dropped deeper towards midfield

In Switzerland, England could find themselves over-run if they go there with two zippy wingers and two strikers.

Rooney’s role is the one which will have to be refined. There was a goal, there was a win but there was no end to the concern.
