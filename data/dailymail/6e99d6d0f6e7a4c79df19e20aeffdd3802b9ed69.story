This giant chewing gum masterpiece took 4,000 pieces of chewing gum and three months to make.

With patience and painstaking precision French artist Jeremy Laffon built the complex geometrical structure, which stood at  almost two metres and was nearly three metres long.

The sticks were stacked, piled and assembled with care, but Laffon deliberately melted a few so that the towers would eventually fall down.

Minty metropolis: The chewing gum sculpture took almost three months to build

Art in progress: French artist Jeremy Laffon from Marseilles undertook the painstaking work, inspired by house of cards constructions, as something to entertain his art class

Laffon, from Marseilles, explained that he wanted the towers to begin disintegrating, despite all his months of hard work.

'It represents a sculpture of frustration and that's why I chose to knock it down by melting a few crucial pieces.

'After melting a few sticks, the work fell down and collapsed slowly.'

The 34-year-old said that it started as a way to interest his art class: 'I was invited to teach a room full of art students and I had to find something that would occupy so many people.

'I was inspired by the system of matchitecture, where thousands of matches are used to create a sculpture.

'I've always been fascinated by the 
construction of a house of cards and decided to create a sculpture with a
material that hasn't been used before.'

Spectacular sculpture: The chewing gum artwork started off held together by saliva, but eventually needed glue to help it stay upright

As a contemporary artist, Laffon was looking for an original material that would prove to be challenging to work with.

He added: 'I wanted to use something that was challenging and the characteristics of chewing gum seemed perfect.

'Chewing gum is unstable and I thought that it would be tough to create a huge sculpture out of this material.'

The scaffolding-like structures were made into fragile twisting towers and Laffon artist had to adapt his methods to make sure the sculpture could start off properly upright.

He said: 'I tried to complete the design by just using saliva, but 
that wasn't strong enough, so I had to use glue to make it secure.'

Inspiration: Laffon used the principle of geometrical stacking as his starting point

All in the detail: The chewing gum sticks were delicately balanced and stacked to make the structure strong enough to stand up

Elaborate: The complex work of art stood at almost two metres and nearly three metres long

'Then, the sculpture was constructed much like a house of cards.'

The sculptures had a strong resemblance to a city skyline - but Laffon did not have a particular place in mind.

He added: 'Inevitably, the sculpture makes people think of a city because of the geometrical construction.'

Laffon bought the gum from a French supermarket, before Cadbury France stepped in to supply him with the rest.

Falling down: Jeremy melted a few chewing gum pieces so that the city skyline would gradually crumble to the ground

Deliberate disintegration: Laffon wanted the skyline to collapse slowly

The end: The city towers ended up totally disintegrating, replicating a town that had turned to rubble
