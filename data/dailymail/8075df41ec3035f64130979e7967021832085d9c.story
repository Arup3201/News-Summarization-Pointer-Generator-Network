With confirmation on the packet that the product contains '100 per cent British potatoes', you can hardly accuse the manufacturer of misleading customers.

But when Richard Bootman, 25, opened a packet of Snackrite steak and onion crisps from Aldi for his morning snack, he certainly did not expect to find a whole potato inside - and no crisps.

The architectural designer from Mildenhall, Suffolk, left colleagues at his office in Bury St Edmunds in fits of laughter after the actual contents of the 25g bag from a store in Brandon became clear.

Mr Bootman told BT.com: ‘I picked it up and it was airtight so I didn’t question it. At first I thought it was a ball of soggy crisps. When I realised what it was, everyone in the office laughed.

‘We couldn’t believe it. It is likely I will buy them again - brand doesn’t bother me with crisps. But I will feel up the pack before I open them.’

Mr Bootman said the bag - which came from a multipack - was clean inside, so appeared to have never held crisps. He added that the potato looked as if it had been oiled ready to cook.

Bemused by what had happened, he posted an image of the crisp packet on Twitter for the attention of Aldi - which apologised and offered a refund if he returned it with a receipt.

His post on March 9 has since been retweeted dozens of times, while Mr Bootman said news of his find had been covered as far afield as Russia, India and Taiwan.

When fellow Twitter users asked him if the image was a wind-up, he replied: 'Nope, no prank, people in my office witnessed me opening the bag, then we all burst into laughter.'

But one of the respondents to his post, Steven Bennett, suggested: 'Packing employee with a sense of humour perhaps?'

An Aldi spokesman said: ‘Aldi is aware of this incident and is happy to offer the customer a full refund.'
