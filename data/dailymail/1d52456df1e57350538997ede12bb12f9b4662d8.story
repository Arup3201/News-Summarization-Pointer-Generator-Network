A cynic might suspect Kenny McDowall knew what he was doing. The interim Rangers boss used a press conference to reveal that five Newcastle loan players shipped north on a Sports Direct truck must play if they are fit.

A coach who wanted the Ibrox job on a permanent basis would be unwise to detonate a bomb under Mike Ashley.

McDowall is different. He is playing out time. He began a 12-month notice period last month and the suspicion is he would be less than devastated if what he said on Thursday was taken the wrong way. If they pay him off now, he’ll cope.

Scottish football thought it had seen the last of this stuff when Vladimir Romanov, the erstwhile king of Hearts, was detained by the Russian authorities.

But Mad Vlad has merely given way to Big Mike Ashley, the de facto banker of Rangers who has now purchased the right to use one of Scotland’s biggest football clubs as a real life version of Championship Manager.

Rangers, in essence, have become a nursery club for Newcastle United. A vehicle for enhancing the fitness of loan quintet Haris Vuckic from Slovenia, English defender Remie Streete, Burundi-born Gael Bigirimana, Swiss defender Kevin Mbabu and Northern Ireland winger Shane Ferguson.

For the SFA, currently investigating alleged breaches of dual interest rules at Ibrox, the charge sheet is growing ahead of a hearing next month.

‘As far as I’ve been told, providing they are fit, the boys will play in the team and I’ll carry that instruction out,’ McDowall revealed. ‘In terms of once the game has started, I will make substitutions as I see fit.

‘It’s a slightly unenviable situation for the boys who’ve come in. But let’s not forget these boys have come from Newcastle, so they’ll be good players and it’s a good addition to our squad. It can be a positive, absolutely, and you’d hope that other people will get a lift from it.’

Recruiting five promising players from Newcastle, an established English Premiership club, could prove no bad thing. Against Celtic last weekend, Rangers were pitiful; a Samson shorn of their locks. The loan players — two defenders, two midfielders and an attacker — have the capacity to make the team better, starting with Sunday’s Cup game against Raith Rovers.

The problem lies in the principle. The idea that a shareholder with 8.92 per cent of the club, heavily securitised loans and the club’s commercial valuables safely under lock and key can also dictate five of the starting places in the Rangers first team. Irrespective of form or ability. Whatever they say publicly, existing players will welcome the newcomers with the kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for a tax bill.

‘I can’t answer for the other players in the dressing room,’ said McDowall, ‘but I would hope that they would be professional and continue to work hard in training.

‘The new boys are settling in fine. They are nice lads, I met them on Wednesday. Two of them trained on the first day and the other fit one will train today. They took part in the session and did fine.

‘All the players here have to just accept that’s what happens at big clubs. Players come in — but they have to continue to work hard.

‘If I have to tell a player that I can’t pick him, that’s just where it’s at. They have to be professional.’

Under the rules set down by Ashley and Derek Llambias, only three of the five are likely to play against Raith Rovers.

Ferguson and Mbabu remain a few weeks away from full fitness and have yet to arrive in Glasgow. They are not completely unknown to McDowall.

‘Myself and Ally (McCoist) went down in November to watch a Newcastle reserve game in which two of the boys played,’ he revealed. ‘But in terms of deciding which ones were coming in, I spoke with Derek about a month ago and he made me aware that he was trying to bring players in and it could possibly be five coming up.’

 With Newcastle players now moving to Rangers on loan, Mike Ashley's interest in the club continues to grow

Vuckic, Bigirimana and Streete can — and will —play on Sunday. That the man ostensibly known as the manager has barely seen them play is neither here nor there.

‘All I will say is that the more I see of the boys on the training field, the more I can get working with them,’ added McDowall.

‘I would like to think that would help. But they play with Newcastle, so they are good players — let’s not forget that.’

The players, like the manager, have been placed in an unenviable situation. For a coach in normal circumstances, all of this would be intolerable.

Agreeing to provide cover until the end of the season after Ally McCoist was placed on gardening leave, however, McDowall’s terms and conditions were made clear. Players coming and going were none of his business.

He probably expected, as we all did, that he would follow McCoist onto the allotment soon enough.

It’s far from impossible his revelations will force the issue, despite reiterating his commitment to his professional duties.

‘I have intimated I am working my notice, but every time I pick a team to go out there I want to win for Rangers. That will not change.

‘It’s been tough, but I am trying to get on with things as best I can. Keep the boys upbeat and try to win football matches. That’s what my job is.

‘Twelve months notice I am working and that’s me.’

He didn’t quite slap his thighs in relief, but the thought might have crossed his mind. Where the Rangers circus is concerned, every man has his limits.

Gael Bigirimana: The 21-year-old has made 26 appearances for Newcastle since arriving from Coventry City in 2012 for £1m. After impressing during his first season, the Burundi-born midfielder - likened to Cheick Tiote - has failed to progress and was soon demoted to the reserves.

Haris Vuckic: The playmaker joined Newcastle from Domzale in 2009 - after they beat off competition from AC Milan - but he has struggled with injuries, damaging his knee and ankle ligaments in one match for Slovenia Under 19s. He has previously been loaned out to Rotherham United and Cardiff City.

Kevin Mbabu: The 19-year-old Swiss defender joined Newcastle's academy in January, 2013 but is yet to make an appearance for the first team.

Remie Streete: English centre back Streete is a product of the club's youth system and joined them as a 13-year-old. He was loaned to Port Vale earlier this season. He was highly-rated all through his progression at the academy but now looks set to leave the club in the summer.

Shane Ferguson: Northern Ireland winger Ferguson has made 30 appearances for Newcastle and, under Alan Pardew, enjoyed a run in the side in 2012. He lost his place, however, and hasn't featured for the first team in nearly two years. He also has 18 senior caps for his country.
