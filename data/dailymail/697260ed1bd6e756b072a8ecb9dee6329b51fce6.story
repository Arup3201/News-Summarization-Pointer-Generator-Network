Out: New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez may miss out on six weeks of games due to a knee injury

New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez will be out for up to six weeks after he had surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee.

A team spokesman said today that the All-Star third baseman was operated on in Miami by Dr Lee Kaplan today.

Rodriguez, who sat out games against the
Tampa Bay Rays on Saturday and Sunday, was due to undergo the surgery 
at the University of Miami.

Dr Kaplan will oversee the early stages of Rodriguez's rehabilitation in Miami.

Yankees manager Joe Girardi said in a statement: 'There is no doubt we're going to miss him but we need to find a way.

'As I've said several times already this
year, some people are going to have to step up. Up to this point, this 
team has.

'We certainly look forward to getting a healthy Alex back into 
our lineup, because we know what he adds to this team.'

Rodriguez, who turns 36 later this month, hurt his knee running the bases against the Chicago Cubs last month and underwent tests Friday because of lingering soreness.

He went on to play in 14 games after the injury but despite hitting 13 home runs this season, he has been unable to knock one out since the tear occurred.

Instead of joining in the All Star festivities in Arizona on Monday, he was having the arthroscopic surgery in Miami.

The Yankees are currently trailing the Boston Red Sox by 
one game in the American League East and the loss of 'A-Rod' is a blow 
to their hopes of gaining top spot.

Teammate Derek Jeter, who just came off the disabled list last week after a calf strain, has also bowed out due to injury.

Jeter hit the 3000th home run of his career at the game on Saturday.

Eduardo Nunez, who filled in for Jeter when the Captain was out with the calf injury, will now man third base for A-Rod.

It is not known whether or not girlfriend Cameron Diaz was by his side as she is currently promoting her new movie Bad Teacher.

'A-Rod' is currentlyÂ  hitting .295 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs this season.

This is the fourth season in a row Rodriguez has managed to find himself on the disabled list. Between 2008-2010, he's missed 61 games total games due to injuries.
