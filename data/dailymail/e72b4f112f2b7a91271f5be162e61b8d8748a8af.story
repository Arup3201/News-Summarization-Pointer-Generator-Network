Hospital admissions for stress have risen by seven per cent in just one year, it was revealed today.

Stress admission rates at hospitals in England rose by 410 to 6,370 in the 12 months to May, compared to 5,960 in the year beforehand.

The most likely patients were people of working age, from 18 to 60, figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) show.

On the increase: Stress admission rates at hospitals in England rose by 410 to 6,370 in the 12 months to May, compared to 5,960 the year before

The report, which considers admissions only and not cases dealt with solely in A&E, shows that stress admissions rose at a faster rate than overall admissions overall, which increased by about 2 per cent in the same period.

Men accounted for 54 per cent of stress admissions, but women made up 63 per cent of all anxiety admissions and admission rates were higher for females than males across all age groups.

The figures also showed that admissions rose with increasing age until 50, when they declined steadily.

HSCIC chief executive Tim Straughan said: 'It might be assumed that stress and anxiety are conditions that result in a journey to a GP consulting room rather than a hospital ward.

'However, our figures suggest thousands of cases a year arise where patients suffering from stress or anxiety become hospitalised in England.'

The North-West had the highest admission rate for stress of any region, while the South-West had the lowest.

The report covered two different conditions - stress (the feeling of being under too much emotional or mental pressure) and also anxiety (the feeling of mild or severe unease, such as worry or fear).

In contrast to stress, admissions for anxiety fell by 3 per cent in the same time period, from 8,810 to 8,590 and admissions for this condition were highest among the elderly.

Mr Straughan said: 'The report highlights a marked contrast between stress and anxiety admissions to hospital over the last two 12 month periods.

'On one hand, stress admissions have risen by 7 per cent to 6,370; while on the other anxiety admissions have fallen by 3 per cent to 8,590.

'Despite this shift in balance however, many more cases of anxiety were admitted than for stress.

'There is also a clear difference in the likely age of a patient admitted for one of these conditions. While working-aged people account for the highest rate of admissions for stress, it appears hospital admissions resulting from anxiety are more amongst the elderly.'
