Sales of kettles have dipped by nearly 600,000 a year, in the past five years, according to the research

Putting the kettle on is undoubtedly still an essential ingredient of everyday British life, but a recent study has found for the first time in years, less than eight in ten homes in the UK own one of the appliances.

And in the past five years, sales of kettles have also lost steam, dipping by nearly 600,000 a year, according to the research.

Kettles are facing competition from coffee machines, one-cup hot water dispensers and even people heating water in microwave ovens, the study suggests.

Sales are also believed to have been hit as less people are drinking tea and coffee nowadays, believing caffeine is unhealthy.

Demand for kettles has dropped by a massive seven per cent in the past five years, from 8.1 million sold in 2007 to 7.5 million in 2012, according to the figures from market analysts Mintel.

In 2008 nearly 15 per cent or one in seven people bought a new kettle, but by last year that figure had dipped to 12.8 per cent.

Overall ownership of kettles has declined from 83 per cent of the population in 2008 to 78 per cent in 2012.

Neil Mason, head of retail research at Mintel, said: 'Penetration of kettles has declined by almost five five percentage points since 2008.

'To some degree this reflects competition from other appliances such as hot water taps and one-cup boilers, but also the fact that hot drinks are falling out of favour with many younger consumers, and that some households simply make do using their main cooking appliances.

'Although environmental credentials have not shaped trends within the small kitchen appliance market to the same extent as the ovens market, the kettles market is likely to be the small kitchen appliance category most affected by consumer efforts to reduce their energy bills.

'The ability for consumers to be able to access only the hot water that they need, either through tap design or alternative categories in the small kitchen appliance market, will continue to eat into kettle sales.'

The electric kettle was invented by Russell Hobbs in 1956, but became popular in homes from the early 1960s onwards.

Other small kitchen appliances falling out of fashion include smoothie makers and juicers, George Foreman-style health grills and deep fat fryers.

Mintel's research shows that sales of coffee makers have outperformed other small kitchen appliances, reflecting Britain's growing appetite for lattes and espressos which started on the High Street.

More than one in five - 22 per cent - of homes in Britain now have a coffee machine, compared to 16 per cent in 2008.
