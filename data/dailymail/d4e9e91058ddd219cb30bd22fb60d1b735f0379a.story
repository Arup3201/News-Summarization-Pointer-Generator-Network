Great Britain's Shona Richards was delighted after she broke the national record and claimed silver in the 400 metres hurdles on the fourth day of the World Junior Championships in Oregon.

The 18-year-old came home second in a time of 56.16 seconds, close behind winner Shamier Little, who clocked 55.66secs, while her American compatriot Jade Miller was third with a PB of 56.22.

Richards said: 'It means a lot. I've been training for this all year. In my head I was thinking "come on fight for that place" and I completely forgot about the national record. I think as soon as you forget about things like that it's when you get them.

'In my head in the whole week I've been looking for a medal and I wanted second because that's where I should be from the rankings, so to get that is brilliant and I can't really ask for much more.

'It was quite a clean race; I was a bit worried about being from lane six because I knew I couldn't see my main competition on the inside of me.

'I was a bit nervous about that but I just went out nearly as fast as I could and tried to stick with it. I think I did quite well, I got my stride pattern and everything and it all went really well.

'I completely forgot about the British record so it was great when I realised I'd got it and it's kind of a double win.

'I've been looking at that all season but whenever I really thought about it I'd run a race where I should have got it and mess up. So in a race where all I was thinking about was medals the time came with it and the British record is a bonus.'
