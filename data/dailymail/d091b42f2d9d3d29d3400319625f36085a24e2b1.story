A 24-year-old man has been shot to death after warning a reckless driver to slow down around children who were playing in a Florida street, police have said.

Bradley Holt reportedly spotted a yellow Ford Mustang driving erratically around a group of youngsters outside his apartment in Miami's Allapattah neighborhood on Thursday evening.

He confronted the occupants of the vehicle, warning them to slow down in a bid to protect the children, witnesses said. But minutes later, someone inside the car allegedly fired at him twice.

'I saw a yellow car. It was driving crazy. We all ran in the house. We heard gunshots,' a six-year-old boy, who was playing in the street at the time, told NBC Miami.

Mr Holt, who was struck in the head by one of the bullets, was rushed to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center. Despite medics' best efforts, he died shortly after his arrival. 

Speaking to Local10.com, the victim's sister, Shanay Flowers, said her brother's selfless actions meant none of the children were injured in the shooting on the 3200 block of Northwest 11th Court.

'There are so many kids in the neighborhood, she said. 'He didn't want them to hit the kids.'

Kenia Reyes, of Miami police, added: 'It's a sad story because obviously what this good Samaritan was doing was trying to protect the safety of the children that were playing outside their home.' 

At the time of the shooting, the driver of the Mustang was  'doing donuts in the middle of the street', Ms Reyes's colleague, officer Kenia Fallat, said.

Police are still uncertain as to the number of occupants in the car, which is still missing and has been described as a 1988 or 1998 model convertible.
