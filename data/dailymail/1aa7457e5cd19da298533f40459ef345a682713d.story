A rare species has been sighted in a Mexican lake just a month after scientists said it may be extinct in the wild.

The axolotl is a newt-like creature which has furry external gills, small feet and a tail and its only known natural habitat is one lake system near Mexico city.

Scientists thought it had become extinct last month, killed by pollution from surrounding slums and out-competed by larger fish, after they failed to find one while surveying the waters.

Researchers investigating the axolotl in Mexico say they have spotted the creature twice after a previous group of researchers said it may be extinct in the wild

The newt-like animal has only one known habitat, the Xochimilco series of lakes and canals near Mexico city which were built by ancient Mayans to grow food

However a different team say they have twice spotted the small creature, nicknamed the 'water monster', although they have yet to catch one.

Biologist Armando Tovar Garza, of Mexico's National Autonomous University, said: 'We weren't able to capture them because the behavior of the axolotl makes them very difficult to capture.

'We haven't had any captures, but we have had two sightings. That's important, because it tells us we still have a chance.'

Its only natural habitat is the Xochimilco network of lakes and canals — the 'floating gardens' of earth piled on reed mats that the Aztecs built to grow crops.

The axolotl is scientifically important because, aside from its strange looks, it also has the ability to regenerate severed limbs.

Some axolotls still survive in aquariums, water tanks and research labs, but experts said those conditions aren't the best, because of interbreeding

The axolotl is endangered because of sewage from nearby slums which leak into the waters of the lake, and also competition from fish such as carp and tilapia which have been introduced

Releasing captive-bred axolotls into the wild could spread a fungus infection that is fatal to them and could reduce their genetic diversity. Tovar Garza said some small mutations, possibly the result of interbreeding, have already been seen.

Alarmed by the creature's falling numbers in recent years, researchers built axolotl "shelters" in Xochimilco to help them breed in the cleanest part of their remaining habitat.

Sacks of rocks and reedy plants act as filters around a selected area, and cleaner water is pumped in, to create better conditions.

The shelters also include permeable cages and other devices intended to help protect axolotls from non-native carp and tilapia that were introduced to the lake system years ago and compete with axolotls for food.

Growing up to a foot long (30 centimeters), axolotls use four stubby legs to drag themselves along the bottom or thick tails to swim in Xochimilco's murky channels while feeding on aquatic insects, small fish and crustaceans. But the surrounding garden-islands have increasingly been converted to illicit shantytowns, with untreated sewage often running off into the water.

The Mexican Academy of Sciences said in a statement that a 1998 survey found an average of 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer, a figure that dropped to 1,000 in a 2003 study and 100 in a 2008 survey.
