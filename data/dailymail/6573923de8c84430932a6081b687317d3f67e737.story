Gary Lineker has backed under-fire forward Mario Balotelli and revealed he sees no problem with players wanting to swap shirts half way through matches.

The enigmatic forward caused uproar when he swapped shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe during half time of his side's 3-0 defeat at Anfield.

But the Match of the Day presenter claimed he doesn't feel such actions have any negative effects, and can't see why supporters are so angry with the 24-year-old.

Lineker tweeted: 'On the Balotelli shirt swapping furore: I doubt they're having the same debate in Spain re Pepe. All is fine when you win.

'Can't see the negative in half time shirt swap. Does it affect result? No. Does it affect performance? No. Is it unsportsmanlike? No. 

'Positives to half time shirt swap: Is it better than fighting in the tunnel? Yes. Are shirts less sweaty than they are at the end? Yes.

'Anyway I'm going to swap shirts and get on with my day. It's an interesting debate though. What's important and what isn't?'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was not impressed by Balotelli's decision to swap shirts before half-time

The Liverpool Echo's back page called for the former AC Milan forward to apologise for the incident

The 24-year-old forward has scored just one goal since moving to the club for £16million in the summer
