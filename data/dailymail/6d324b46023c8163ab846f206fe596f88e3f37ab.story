A hunter has created a new range of camouflage gear which is so effective the wearer blends perfectly into the scenery, just like a real-life Predator from the Hollywood films.

In terrifying news for unsuspecting fauna, American company Realtree has launched the latest in a line of state-of-the-art clothing which enables hunters to blend seamlessly into their surroundings.

The patterns, which help to disrupt the wearer's silhouette, have been inspired by naturally occurring flora and fauna.

In this amazing series of photographs, it is almost impossible to spot the hunters as they blend into the scenery behind them.

From a snow coated forest to a luscious green bush the hunters are almost completely undetectable to the naked eye.

In fact, modern camouflage gear is so effective, many states in America order people to wear 
brightly coloured blaze orange when hunting - particularly when pursuing 
medium to large size game animals in dark conditions.

It is a safety precaution against being shot by other hunters and accidents.

Realtree's clothing is made by outdoorsman and company founder Bill Jordan, who has spent 25 years perfecting the designs.

He was born and raised in Columbus, 
Georgia, where he started out working for the family boat
 dealership, Leon Jordan Marine.

In
 1983, Mr Jordan started Spartan Archery Products in the back of the family 
boat business.

The company developed and manufactured a variety of 
archery clothing and accessories in the basic woodland and WWII 
camouflage patterns popular in that period.

At
 this same time, he began designing and developing what would become 
Realtree, the world’s most effective camouflage pattern, which he 
introduced at the 1986 Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trade show.

In
 the late 1980s, he introduced the first Team Realtree logo to make 
sure readers knew which camo they were seeing in the pages of magazines.
 Today Team Realtree can be found on hundreds of products and even 
Daytona 500 champion Kevin Harvick’s race car.

Masters of disguise: It has taken more than 25 years to fine tune the design of the camouflage gear

In 1992, the 'Realtree Outdoors' television show began airing nationally.

By
 the mid ‘90s, Realtree became a sponsor of Richard Childress Racing’s 
#31 car, driven by Mike Skinner, which lead in later years to associate 
sponsorship of Dale Earnhardt’s #3, Kevin Harvick’s #29 and several 
other car sponsorships and merchandise deals.

In
 1999, Mr Jordan founded Immersion Graphics Corporation, which utilizes a 
hydro-graphic film process to apply camouflage and other decorative 
patterns to a variety of hard goods such as ATV, bows and guns.

Whiteout: Cloaked head to toe in the camouflage, the hunter is almost indistinguishable from his surroundings

Concealment: The light and shade of a thicket of twigs is the perfect surroundings in which to hide

Hidden: For enthusiastic hunters, this camouflage gear gives them the uncanny ability to hide amongst the foliage and mud of their background

The firm produces gear for environments around the world and uses the design of mother nature to make their clothing.

Today's camo designs are created using sophisticated computers, digital cameras, and photo-realistic printing.

They are the product of painstaking research over decades and designed to use the light and dark of natural surroundings

Realtree employs more than 80 people in Columbus, Georgia, and also has operations in Europe.
