A robot that successfully defused bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan was finally destroyed in a blast.

The device named Scooby Doo, was an iRobot PackBot, which are 60-pound, treaded robots used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and bomb disposal.

They have four cameras, an articulated arm with gripper, and flippers that allow them to go over obstacles such as stairs.

They were used extensively to dispose of domestic bombs during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as the best tools for tackling IEDs (improvised explosive devices), which are the number one killer of soldiers there.

The destroyed robot was used by Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal units in Iraq used to dispose of 17 IEDs, one car bomb, and one unexploded bomb.

For every successful mission it completed, soldiers drew a hash mark on the device similar to the way fighter jets mark the number of enemies.

But the robot failed to survive a recent mission when it was destroyed while being used to defuse an IED that exploded.

Soldiers became attached to the robot that was used to help them detect disposed bombs

A repair technician said there was no way it could be fixed leaving soldiers feeling bereft.

According to Gizmodo, EOD units have been known to assign their robots personalities and promote them to titles such as Staff Sargent, award them Purple Hearts, and even hold funerals for the destroyed devices that have assisted them on the frontline.

The remains of the Scooby Doo robot are now on display at a museum in Bedford, Massachusetts alongside a plaque dedicated to it.
