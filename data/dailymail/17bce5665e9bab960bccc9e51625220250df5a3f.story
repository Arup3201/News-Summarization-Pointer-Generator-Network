YouTube will distribute the Sony Pictures film The
Interview, offering online rentals and purchases of the movie beginning today at 10:00 a.m. PST.

The Internet streaming of the film comes a day before the movie's showing at approximately 300 movie theaters across the country, as well as its release on video on demand.

What's more, the release of the film on YouTube may now allow for worldwide viewing of the once doomed movie - even in North Korea.

CNN reports that previous negotiations with Apple's iTunes store fell apart. 

It will also be released on Microsoft X Box, www.seetheinterview.com and HD on Google Play, costing $5.99 to rent and $14.99 to purchase.

In a statement, Google revealed that Sony first contacted them about a possible online release last Wednesday, the same day they announced they would not be distributing the film.  

This following a threat of terrorism that forced major movie chains across the country to announce that they would not be showing the film as scheduled for fear of legal repercussions should the group behind the threats follow through on their claims.

The refusal of these theaters to show The Interview is no doubt what opened the door to the possibility of an online release, as the studio did not have to worry about the push by many theater owners to stop the practice of same-day-and-date release.

The studio's CEO Michael Lynton seemed determined for the film to get an online release earlier in the week, and across as many platforms as possible.

While announcing on Tuesday that the film would be getting a limited theatrical run and be available on video on demand, Lynton also said; 'We are continuing our efforts to secure more platforms and more theaters so that this movie reaches the largest possible audience.' 

The film's release across a variety of viewing platforms will no doubt be followed closely by many in Hollywood, as the industry has never had a film of this magnitude open online, on demand and in theaters simultaneously. 

That being said, Sony revealed on Wednesday that they would not be releasing any of the film's online viewership or sales numbers to the public.
