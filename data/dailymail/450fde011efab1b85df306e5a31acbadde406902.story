Trouble: Ed Miliband has been urged to investigate Unite's influence in Labour constituencies

Ed Miliband must win an ‘ideological battle’ with his union paymasters to avoid political oblivion, Lord Reid warned yesterday.

The former home secretary said Unite leader Len McCluskey wanted to take Labour ‘back to the 80s’ – and that Mr Miliband must move swiftly to make sure the party survives.

A senior ally of David Miliband – who lost out on the party leadership due to Ed’s union support – joined the call for ‘decisive action’, stressing that Mr Miliband’s ‘credibility’ is at stake.

Tomorrow, the Labour leader will outline plans to change his party’s rules and limit the power of the unions. 

The speech comes after Unite was accused of trying to fix the selection process for Falkirk’s parliamentary candidate to benefit Mr McCluskey’s close friend Karie Murphy.

Police have launched a fraud inquiry over claims that people were signed up as Labour party members by Unite – without their knowledge – so they could vote for Miss Murphy.

Labour bosses have also received complaints about Unite’s activities in several other constituencies.

Now Blairite Lord Reid has said Mr Miliband faces ‘an ideological battle’ with ‘those who want to take Labour back to the 70s and 80s, as Len McCluskey does – when we represented the sectional voice, the weak echo of every industrial demand of the trade unions’.

‘I am in no doubt that the leader of Unite wants to impose an ideological direction on the Labour Party that would lead us into political oblivion,’ he added.

A senior figure close to David Miliband 
piled on more pressure, issuing a coded warning that the Labour leader’s
position depends on his performance tomorrow.

He told the Mail: ‘It needs to be a 
very, very strong speech. This is about the future of the Labour Party 
and whether people will see Ed as a credible prime minister.’

The 
frontbencher added: ‘Ed still enjoys a lot of goodwill. People 
instinctively want him to succeed. But Tuesday is a very big day in 
terms of maintaining that support.’

Mr Miliband’s deputy Harriet Harman 
announced yesterday that Labour will cap the amount of money that can be
spent by candidates and their union backers in selection contests.

Insiders say Mr Miliband is examining 
whether to hold open primary elections – which would let the general 
public elect parliamentary candidates – as well as plans to speed up the
selection process, leaving unions less time to mobilise.

He also plans 
to make it more difficult for unions to sign up new party members.

Demand: Grant Shapps called for Mr Miliband to reveal the unions' continued influence

Leaked Unite documents show it sought to exploit rules that let unions 
pay new members’ fees to secure 41 candidacies.

Labour has since 
scrapped the scheme.

Party insiders said concerns have 
already been raised about the union’s activities in Chester and 
Brighton, Glasgow, Crawley, East Dunbartonshire, Paisley, Garston and 
Halewood and Ilford North. 

Unite has also been accused of plotting to 
oust shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said Mr 
Miliband should re-run every constituency selection that has taken place
since he became leader.

‘Ed Miliband is admitting that his candidate 
selection process and the way the Labour Party is bankrolled by the 
union barons is broken,’ he said.

‘He should refuse to take any more 
money from the unions until the funding system is fixed.

'If he doesn’t, 
then it’s still the same old Labour Party, bankrolled by the union 
barons and with a leader who’s not in control.’

Mr McCluskey has urged Mr Miliband to 
‘step back from the brink of a ruinous division’, adding: ‘Don’t let 
Blairite diehards be your backseat drivers.’
