French giants Paris-Saint Germain would be at the front of the queue to sign Lionel Messi if he becomes available, according to midfielder Javier Pastore.

Recent speculation has linked Messi with a move away from the Nou Camp, with reports in Spain claiming the Argentine is frustrated with life under manager Luis Enrique.

The 27-year-old has a contract until 2018 and is believed to have a buy-out clause of £196million, but Pastore believes PSG have the resources to bring him to the Parc des Princes.

Speaking to TyC Sports, Pastore said: 'If Messi were to leave Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain's owner will be right there to strike a deal.'

The Ligue 1 club have spent big on new players since being bought by Qatari investors in the summer of 2011, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and David Luiz among the marquee signings made.

And Pastore, who himself made a £37m move to Paris three-and-a-half years ago, is confident that his club has enough left in the back to sign his compatriot Messi. 

'Money will not be a problem,' he said. 'The club has the resources to buy a number of Messis.'
