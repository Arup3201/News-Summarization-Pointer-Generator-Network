A grandmother mourning the death of her husband with family was killed on Friday when an 80-year-old driver crashed her car into their restaurant trapping her and her family beneath its wheels.

Family of 82-year-old Virginia Hamlin 
of Anna, Texas say she was dining at the pizzeria with her daughter and grandson so she could share with staff her late husband's obituary when the car came barrelling in.

The 80-year-old driver, who has not been named, is said to have hit the gas pedal instead of her brake causing the horrific crash that hospitalized five, including herself.

Killed: One week after burying her late husband Frank, Virginia Hamlin, pictured with him, stopped by her favourite pizzeria to share his obituary when a car barrelled through killing her

Fatal mistake: Police say the 80-year-old driver of this Mercury sedan mistakenly put her foot on the gas rather than the brake when backing out causing her to drive into the establishment

Injuries: The 80-year-old driver also struck a pole and a minivan sending five in all, including herself, to a hospital

The womanâ€™s family said that Mrs Hamlin 
had wanted to stop by her favourite restaurant to share 
with its staff her late husband Frank's obituary after his funeral last 
week.

According to police the woman was pulling out of a nearby beauty salon when she made her deadly mistake, slamming her vehicle into a pole and a minivan before jumping into Mama Mia's Pizzeria off West Fourth Street.

Mrs Hamlin was taken to a nearby hospital where she died.

'I got cuts, scrapes and bruises, and my mother is the same way,' Mrs Hamlin's grandson Rhett Williams told NBC DFW of the crash that pinned him - one of three victims - beneath the rear right side of the Mercury sedan.

His grandmother's death he said is still 'sinking in.'

Grandson: Mrs Hamlin's grandson Rhett Williams said he was trapped beneath the car but sustained only cuts and bruises while his mother was also hospitalized

Driver's condition: The driver of this vehicle, seen pulled out of the exposed restaurant on Friday evening, is not expected to be charged and remains hospitalized from her injuries

Remembering: Mrs Hamlin's long-time neighbour Diane Oxley said the widow was deeply upset over the loss of her husband of 64 years so she's comforted knowing they're now together

'I think the adrenaline and the shock is still too current,' he said.

Breaking down over news of Mrs Hamlin's was her long-time next door neighbour Diane Oxley.

'She is just such a beautiful person, and I'm just happy that she's with Frank now,' Ms Oxley told NBC beneath heavy tears.

'...she was married like I said for 64 years and she missed him terribly. I know they are together,' she said. 'They're just beautiful people and I'm just glad she wasn't alone when she passed.'

Police say they do not expect to file charges against the driver and as of late Friday they hadn't shared with her the news of Mrs Hamlin's death for fear she wouldn't be able to handle it.

The driver's condition, along with the three other victims, was not immediately released.
