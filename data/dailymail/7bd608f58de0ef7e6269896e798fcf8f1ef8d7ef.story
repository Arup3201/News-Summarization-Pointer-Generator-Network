Britain's spies tried to recruit an agent in North Korea who could provide top-secret information on its fledgling nuclear programme, leaked intelligence documents have revealed.

MI6 wanted details about the dictatorship’s plans in a ‘long-term relationship in return for payment’.

The sensitive revelation emerged from a cache of hundreds of secret documents that were leaked to media organisations and published last night.

Asking for help: MI6 tried to recruit a North Korean agent, meeting the insider for two hours, this cable shows

The electronic files, handed to the Al Jazeera news agency, could cause embarrassment to Britain and other governments in the wake of the revelations two years ago by Edward Snowden.

The latest disclosures are not on the same scale as those exposed in 2013 by the former CIA employee – who is currently in hiding in Russia – but they offer a tantalising glimpse into the shadowy world of espionage, focusing on human intelligence rather than digital intelligence.

Spanning a period from 2006 until December 2014, the digital leak includes detailed briefings and internal analyses written by operatives of South Africa’s State Security Agency.

They reveal the South Africans’ secret correspondence with US intelligence agency the CIA, Britain’s MI6, Israel’s Mossad, Russia’s FSB and Iran’s operatives.

In one document, a cable marked ‘Secret UK/SA eyes only’ shows that MI6, formally referred to as the Secret Intelligence Service, requested assistance from South Africa’s intelligence chiefs to carry out ‘a joint operation’.

The aim was to recruit a spy inside the opaque North Korean decision-making system. An undated cable was sent from an MI6 operative to South Africa ‘requesting your support to assist our officer’.

It said MI6 would intercept the North Korean while in transit between flights in South Africa ‘and encourage him to accept a long-term relationship with SIS’.

It asked South Africa to ‘provide covert surveillance to identify [X] on his arrival … and securely house him whilst our officer makes contact.’

The British agency also requested the South Africans ensured the MI6 officer and the North Korean target were ‘not interrupted by any of his colleagues’.

MI6 wrote: ‘The involvement of South Africa’s authorities would not be apparent to the target – our officer would appear to be acting alone.’

The secret cable also reveals that an MI6 officer had approached the target a year earlier, held a two-hour meeting with him and offered an undisclosed amount of money in exchange for ‘a long-term clandestine relationship’.

The target had ‘stated that he would be happy to meet the officer again under secure circumstances,’ MI6 wrote.

‘But a year has passed without us hearing’ from him, the cable added.

The British spies added that they regarded this as an ‘unusual opportunity, which, if successful, could greatly assist our ongoing efforts to gain coverage of North Korean proliferation activity’.

The leaked documents do not disclose whether or not the South Africans agreed to provide the assistance requested by MI6 or if the plan was a success.

Other documents revealed that:

The case of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, contradicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came after he made a theatrical 2012 speech to the United Nations.

Netanyahu urged military action against Iran so it would 'dismantle its nuclear weapons programme altogether'.

The Israeli Prime Minister even held up a cartoon bomb to show how close Iran was to being capable of a nuclear attack - adding it could happen in a matter of months.

But just a month after his speech in September 2012, agents for the Israeli intelligence service Mossad admitted Iran was not preparing any nuclear weapons. 

Threat: A leaked report, apparently by Israeli spies, appears to contradict the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's 2012 speech warning Iran was close to a nuclear weapon - in which he held up a cartoon bomb

Quote: One line in the report said Iran was allocating its most heavily-enriched uranium to a research reactor

The leaked Mossad report said although there was a 'significant increase' in the amount of uranium Iran had enriched, the country did 'not appear ready' to enrich uranium at the highest rate.

It said Iran had around 100kg of uranium enriched to 20 per cent purity.

Although such uranium can be used to make a bomb, weapons more commonly use uranium at 90 per cent purity, according to the World Nuclear Association.

The report said: 'The quantity of material enriched to 20 per cent is not increasing at this stage as some is being converted to nuclear fuel.

Document: The report, pictured, is one of hundreds of cables obtained by Al Jazeera and the Guardian

Quote: The report featured a 'bottom line', which Israeli officials have argued did follow Netanyahu's warning

'Even though Iran has accumulated enough 5 per cent enriched uranium for several bombs, and has enriched some of it to 20 per cent, it does not appear to be ready to enrich it to higher levels.

'It is allocating some of it to produce nuclear fuel for the TRR [Tehran Research Reactor], and the amount of 20 per cent enriched uranium is therefore not increasing.

'Bottom line: Though Iran at this stage is not performing the activity necessary to produce weapons, it is working to close gaps in areas that appear legitimate such as enrichment, reactors, which will reduce the time required to produce weapons from the time the instruction is actually given.'

The report's disclosure has come at a critical time for relations between the U.S., Israel and Iran.

Netanyahu is due to address the U.S. Congress next Tuesday, and many expect him to make another hardline stand about Iran's nuclear programme.

In the meantime the U.S. is playing a leading role in the international bid to introduce more controls over Iran's nuclear programme, which led to 'constructive' talks today in Geneva, Switzerland.

Iran insists it only uses nuclear technology for civilian power plants, not weapons.

But in his 2012 speech to the UN, the Israeli Prime Minister referred casually to Iran's 'first bomb'.

'The relevant question is not when Iran will get the bomb,' he said. 'The relevant question is at what stage we can we no longer stop Iran from getting the bomb. The red line must be drawn.' 

Showing a cartoon bomb to the world representatives, he said: 'This is a bomb, this is a fuse.

Innocent: Iran has insisted it is only enriching uranium for civilian purposes, not weapons, but the claim is disbelieved by Israel. Pictured: Then-president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad tours an enrichment plant in 2008

'In the case of Iran's nuclear plans to build a bomb, this "bomb" has to be filled with enough enriched uranium and Iran has to go through three stages. 

'Iran's completed the first stage. It took them many years but they completed it and they're 70 per cent of the way there. Now they're well into the second stage'.

He added stage two would be complete by summer 2013 and said: 'From there it's only a few months, possibly a few weeks, before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.

'What I've told you is not based on secret information. It's not based on military intelligence. It's based on the public reports of the International Atomic Energy Agency.'

One senior Israeli government official hit back over the leaked reports - telling the Guardian that there was no contradiction between the report and the Prime Minister's 2012 speech.

Both said that Iran was increasing the rate at which it was enriching uranium, the official said.

Another of the leaked cables claimed Barack Obama 'threatened' Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas over his bid to win formal statehood for Palestine.

The memo, dated November 22, 2012, referenced 'a phone call made between Pres. OBAMA and Pres. ABBAS where Pres. OBAMA threatened Pres. ABBAS if he goes ahead with the UN bid.'

It added Palestinian officials were 'adamant' about pushing through their bid to be recognised at the United Nations.

One intelligence contact said his family - who lived in Gaza - said there was 'no place safe in the whole of Gaza. They are like trapped rats on a boat'.

Another memo claimed a CIA agent had seemed to be 'desperate to make inroads into Hamas in Gaza' - which if true would breach a government ban on contact with the Islamist movement. 

Palestinian officials failed in their bid to be recognised in December when it was blocked by the UN Security Council.

British MPs voted to support the bid, but the UK was only one of 15 countries on the Security Council, of which at least nine had to back Palestinian statehood for it to pass.

The application won the support of eight members of the Security Council, falling short by just one. 

The U.S. - which has a right of veto on the influential body - also voted against the move.
