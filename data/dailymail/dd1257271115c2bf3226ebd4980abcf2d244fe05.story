Acquitted: Teacher Peter Wilson had unfounded allegations made against him

Parents of children taught by the teacher forced to move away from his family over unfounded sex allegations have branded his treatment ‘disgusting’.

They insisted yesterday that Peter Wilson, who was acquitted of touching girls in his primary school class, and his wife Clare were excellent teachers.

The 35-year-old remains suspended from the classroom – as does Mrs Wilson, 29, simply for being married to him.

One father said: ‘Mr Wilson is a great teacher.

‘He’s taught two of my kids and they thought he was great. He’s very friendly – but that’s his style of teaching. It’s all been blown out of proportion.

‘You don’t get many young male teachers in primary schools and I hope we see him back here soon.’

An unnamed mother said: ‘It’s shocking that they wouldn’t let him live with Clare and their son. I think what social services did is disgusting, he’ll never get those first few months back.

‘I just hope they can put it all behind them now and start to rebuild their lives.’

Another woman with children at the school added: ‘It’s fantastic that Mr Wilson has been cleared.

‘We never thought he was guilty of anything, but we don’t understand why he’s still suspended.

‘Also, it’s really unfair that Clare was suspended too. It didn’t have anything to do with her.

‘She’s a lovely, lovely woman and she’s really missed in reception where she teaches.’

Mr Wilson was suspended from the 
school in Blackpool – which cannot be named for legal reasons – last 
year after young girls accused him of kissing them and patting them on 
the bottom.

He insisted he had simply been trying 
to encourage pupils with a clasp of the shoulder, a hug or a pat on the 
back, and said the  allegations that his actions were sexually motivated
were ‘probably malicious’.

While Mr Wilson was awaiting trial 
earlier this year, his wife gave birth to their first child and social 
services made him agree not to live with them for eight months.

After he was acquitted on Monday of indecently assaulting five girls, the teacher spoke emotionally about his ‘horrible ordeal’.

However, neither Mr Wilson nor his 
wife is likely to return to the classroom for many months. Blackpool 
council has only now launched an investigation and both teachers remain 
suspended while it is carried out.

It has refused to rule out referring 
Mr Wilson to the General Teaching Council, which could launch 
disciplinary action against him.

The couple declined to comment yesterday at their £250,000 house in nearby Thornton Cleveleys.
