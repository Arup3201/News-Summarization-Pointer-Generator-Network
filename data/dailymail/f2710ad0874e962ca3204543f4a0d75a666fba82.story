Desperation etched across her face, this woman clutches the picture of a little boy shot dead in a random attack in one of Belgium's largest cities.

Gabriel Leblond, 17 months, was the youngest victim of five people killed in a random hand grenade and automatic rifle attack in Liege last week.

Thousands of people took part in a silent ceremony to remember those killed in a city centre square by Nordine Amrani, a 33-year-old man with a criminal record.

Grief: A relative bows her head as she holds a picture of 17-month-old Gabriel Leblond at a service to remember the five victims killed in a gun and hand grenade attack in Liege last week

Grief: The sister of Mehdi Belhadj, who was also killed when a former convict launched a random attack in a Liege central square, hold his picture at the memorial today

Mourning: Thousands of people attended a silent ceremony in the city centre square where the attack took place last Tuesday

Condolences: Princess Mathilde talks with fireman at the ceremony. Crown Prince Philippe and the mayor of Liege are behind them

Homage: Members of the emergency services line a staircase at the square and, right, Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo walks in front of a floral bouquet

Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and Crown Prince Philippe stood with the town mayor on the exact city centre spot where the attack was launched.

Investigators are still looking for clues as to why Amrani swept into the central square and launched his attack.

He killed himself shortly afterwards.

Instead of speeches, a lone trumpet pierced the silence of the half-hour ceremony.

Officials carried white roses and added them to a thick wall of mementos that has continued to grow as residents of Liege expressed their grief.

The Christmas market next to the square remained shut in remembrance of the victims.

Solidarity: Belgium's Crown Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde both attended the service

Horror: The half-hour service featured a long trumpet and thousands of mourners placed flowers and soft toys at the scene in the heart of Liege

Memorial: Piles of flowers and candles have been growing at the square in Liege a week after the attack which killed five people

Flashback: A blanket covers the body of Nordine Amrani at the scene of the attack in Liege last week

Attack: Nordine Amrani hurled a grenade into the square and fired an automatic rifle, killing four people, before turning the gun on himself. He had earlier shot dead a cleaner and dumped her body in a shed he owned

Maxim Lonhienne, who lives in the 200,000 population city, said: 'When I heard and saw this, I was really touched by this tragedy and it is to give homage that I am here.'

At the end of the ceremony, subdued applause rippled across the square as Crown Prince Philippe and Princess Mathilde left.

Authorities said they still do not know what motivated Amrani.

Before the attack, he also shot a cleaner dead and dumped her body in a shed he owned. It is unknown if that killing was connected to the rampage, but police believe he may have attempted to rape her.

Prosecutor Cedric Visart de Bocarme told RTL television: 'We are trying to find out who this person really is and how someone who did not give any sign of mental difficulties could have acted in this way.'

Amrani, who spent time in prison for offences involving guns and drugs, had been called in for questioning in a sexual abuse case on the day of the shooting.

Instead of meeting with investigators, he took a backpack filled with ammunition and grenades to the square.
