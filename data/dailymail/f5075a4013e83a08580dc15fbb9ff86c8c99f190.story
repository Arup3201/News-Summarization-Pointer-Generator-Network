Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio left early from a Church dinner to join a star-studded birthday celebration for Al Sharpton.

The New York Post reports that the governor and the mayor went to receive their lashes at the annual Al Smith dinner, held in support of Catholic charities, before ducking out to wish the Reverend a happy birthday at the Four Seasons two blocks north.

Cuomo reportedly left the white-tie dinner halfway through and arrived still dressed in his tuxedo, while the mayor changed out of his fancy threads before heading over after the event.

They were joined by other New York pols like Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in celebrating Sharpton's 60th.

'He has grown immensely over the years,' said Cuomo during a speech for Al. 'And he’s no longer just New York’s Al Sharpton. He’s the nation’s Rev Sharpton — and the nation is better for it.'

At the  dinner, hosted by the Archdiocese of New York in rememberance of Gov Alfred Smith, the first Catholic candidate for president, Cuomo had taken his licks, according to theDaily News

'The governor just got back from Afghanistan — the only place more hostile than Albany,' said Alfred Smith IV, great grandson of the honoree governor of the dinner.

Toastmasters also took shots at the mayor, with Charlie Rose joking that the next book from Bill O'Reilly, who's written titles such as 'Killing Lincoln' and 'Killing Kennedy,' would be 'Killing Groundhogs.'

'You know where he’s going to go for his researcher,' said Rose, a reference to de Blasio's recent red-faced episode where he dropped the Groundhog's Day mascot, which later died.

Kenneth Langone, the billionaire founder of The Home Depot who earlier this year compared the rhetoric of anti-inequality politicians to that of Hitler, also took the microphone and razzed the Reverend on his birthday.

'I don’t see the person in charge of the NYPD up here tonight - Al Sharpton,' said Langone, to which NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton responded with a big laugh.

But the mayor, arriving at the birthday bash, which was hosted by Sharpton's National Action Network and drew sponsors like AT&T and celebrities like Aretha Franklin, didn't mind the heat.

'The more people criticize him the more I want to hang out with him,' said de Blasio.
