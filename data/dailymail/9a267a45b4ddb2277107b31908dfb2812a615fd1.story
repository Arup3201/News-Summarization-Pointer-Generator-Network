Gerard Streator, 47, from Wisconsin, gets a suspended jail sentence for having sex with a sofa

A man caught having public sofa sex received a suspended jail sentence on Monday - but no order to stay away from attractive furniture.

He was seen mounting a couch discarded on a Wisconsin street last year, and pleaded guilty to a public lewdness charge.

During a hearing in Waukesha County Circuit Court, Gerard Streator, 47, was sentenced to five months suspended in jail, and placed on a year's probation.

Additionally, Streator was ordered to pay $243 in court costs, directed to 'maintain absolute sobriety,' and barred from possessing 'pornography of any kind.'

According to a criminal complaint sworn by a Waukesha City Police Department officer, Streator's 11pm furniture tryst was interrupted by an off-duty cop out jogging.

Officer Ryan Edwards reported spotting 'a subject leaning over the couch facing down and it looked like he was having sexual relations with someone on the couch.'

Edwards said he 'could see the male's hips thrusting up and down on the couch.'

But when he went over and yelled, 'What are you doing?,' Streator dismounted the love seat and ran away, revealing he was the only one involved.

As the suspect fled, Edwards reported, he 'could see that the defendant's penis was erect.'

The officer concluded that Streator 
'had been thrusting his pelvic area against the cushions and trying to 
sexually gratify himself by rubbing his penis between the two cushions.'

Streator's
guilty plea came two months after a Circuit Court judge ruled that he 
was competent to stand trial after a psychologist's report was compiled.
