Police took revenge on dozens of riot looters last night as they kicked in their front doors and hauled them into the street.

Riot officers armed with battering rams descended on a string of properties as they looked for pay back over the chaos that swept the country.

The officers collared one suspect at a home in Brixton after receiving a tip off that he had been involved in the disturbances.

He is likely to be the first of hundreds more who are brought to justice as a huge public backlash grows against the troublemakers.

How does it feel? A suspected looter is paraded through the street and bundled into a police van after his home in Brixton was raided last night

The police action came as the rioters' reign of terror seemingly evaporated into the night.

Just as the first bursts of violence 
in Tottenham came from nowhere, so the trouble unexpectedly receded. 
Contributory factors may have included the fact that police forces 
throughout the nation were braced for action with as many blue uniformed
bodies as they could put on the street; 16,000 in London alone.

Perhaps
the three deaths in Birmingham yesterday prompted a rethink by some. And with the arrest
figures in London alone up to 888 perhaps there were just too few 
rioters and looters to cause the same level of disturbance. 

But
with no serious incidents overnight, simply a procession of charged 
rioters trudging through overnight court sittings, the lull in violence 
begs the question: Is the worst over?

On Wednesday youths had rampaged through Manchester's 
city centre, turning it into a war zone, and boasted that the government had
lost control of the cities. They pledged to continue as long as they 
could.

And even if they do get caught, they 
are not afraid of the consequences, with one telling BBC Radio 4's Today
programme: 'What are they gonna do? Give me an Asbo? I'll live with 
that.'

London remained relatively calm on Tuesday evening thanks to a mammoth police presence, but looting and thuggery 
continued in Birmingham and Liverpool, and broke out for the first time 
in Manchester, Nottingham and Gloucester.

Regional
forces, seemingly caught on the back foot after donating hundreds of 
riot officers to help the Met regain control of the capital, struggled 
to contain hundreds of yobs who took to the high streets to loot.

But the Met 
pledged that policing numbers would remain at an unprecedented high for 
the second night in a row, leaving forces elsewhere without crack teams 
trained for public disorder as they saw 16,000 police on the streets.

Scotland Yard today said that 888 
people had now been arrested in connection with violence, disorder and 
looting in the capital, with 371 charged.

On Wednesday a police source told Mail 
Online that while there were no early reports of trouble in the capital,
there will remain a 'higher 
more visible police presence on the streets'.

'The
policing will be widespread across the capital,' he added, 'and as we 
have done on previous nights we will be concentrating on areas where we 
have the most concerns.'

In
Manchester, where rioters rampaged through the central 
shopping district, burning and looting shops and fighting running 
battles with police, police said they were making no special 
preparations.

Greater 
Manchester Police said that they were not expecting a second night of 
violence in the city, but did concede that there would be more police on
standby than were available to commanders last night.

A source said: 'There's not a lot 
happening. It's raining here at the moment and we're doing our rain 
dance and hoping they [the rioters] will keep away.

'We have certainly got more officers 
tonight than last night, but whether they are out or not is another 
matter because there's nothing happening.'

However,
rioters quoted by BBC Radio showed a terrifying sense of impunity about
their role in the violent clashes that gripped the heart of the city 
last night.

'Why are you going to miss the opportunity to get free stuff,' one asked a reporter during the unrest last night.

'The government are not in control because if they were we wouldn't be able to do it would we?'

The young looters told the Today 
programme that they were unconcerned about being caught and did not 
expect that they would have to suffer as a result of their crimes.

'This will be my first offence,' continued the young miscreant. 'I've not been in trouble before so I'm not really bothered.

'I'll get a caution. The prisons are full.'

The Metropolitan Police's Deputy 
Assistant Commissioner, Stephen Kavanagh, said some of his officers were
disappointed with the sentences handed out so far to looters.

He
told BBC Breakfast: 'That has been personally raised by me and others, 
and the commissioner I know has also raised it, so we will move through 
those issues and I am confident we will get the support of the courts.'

He said the huge policing presence on the streets would continue for another night, and would then be reviewed.

He added that more than 100 arrest warrants were being executed this morning.

Elsewhere in the country, police were confident they would be able to keep control of the streets.

West Midlands Police, responsible for
maintaining order in three areas where lawlessless broke out last night
promised that there were enough officers to protect communities.

In Birmingham, three men out on the 
streets to protect their community were tragically killed after a rioter
hit them with a car, while in West Bromwich and Wolverhampton youths 
ran amok.

In a statement 
published on the force's website, Chief Constable Chris Sims promised 
that 600 specially trained riot officers would be deployed across the 
region.

All leave for West Midlands officers 
has been cancelled and the force has, where possible, suspended other 
operations, Mr Sims said.

Nottinghamshire
Police is also deploying more officers tonight after Nottingham was 
rocked by civil disorder that saw a mob firebomb a police station.

A
spokesman for the force told MailOnline that they had not sent any 
officers to help with the policing effort in London and that they had 
been given operational support by South Yorkshire police.

She
said that the force were 'more than prepared' for any outbreaks of 
violence but added that intelligence indicated the city would be quieter
tonight.

In Gloucester, a dispersal order 
covering areas where violence broke out will come into from tomorrow and
last until February 11, 2012.

The
order is being introduced in response to an increase in groups behaving
in an anti-social way and intimidating local residents and shoppers.

'The
order allows police or Police Community Support Officers to direct any 
groups of two or more to leave the area for 24 hours when they believe 
the behaviour of the group is likely to result in members of the public 
being harassed, alarmed or distressed,' a force spokesman said.

'Dispersal 
orders provide us with an effective tool which we can use at our 
discretion to ensure that those who intimidate others can be ordered to 
leave an area and receive a strong punishment if they ignore the order.'

Earlier today, the police were given the green light to use water cannons with 24 hours' notice.

David
Cameron, the Prime Minister, said that plans had been put in place to 
deal with the disorder using water cannons - making it the first time 
they would be used on the streets of mainland Britain.

The comments were seen as U-turn on 
what Home Secretary Theresa May said earlier this week when she ruled 
out the use of water cannons.

The 'softly softly' approach has been shelved and police will finally be given the backing to come down hard on offenders.

'Police are already authorised to use 
baton rounds and we agreed at Cobra that, while they are not currently 
needed, we now have in place contingency plans for water cannons to be 
available at 24 hours' notice,' Mr Cameron said in a speech outside 
Downing Street this morning.

'Whatever resources the police need they will get. What ever tactics they feel they need they will have legal backing to do so.'

Mr
Cameron insisted the 'fightback' by police was succeeding today after a
fourth night of rioting across the country. He said a 'more robust 
approach' by Scotland Yard last night had prevented a repeat of the 
worst trouble.

The PM said 
it was 'simply not acceptable' that violence was taking place and had 
spread to Manchester, Birmingham and Nottingham overnight.
