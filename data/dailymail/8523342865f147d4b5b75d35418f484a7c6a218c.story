Hillary Clinton was lauded for her record-breaking travels while Secretary of State and her husband make international trips regularly on behalf of his charitable foundation, but the couple is keeping quiet about their latest jaunt.

The former President and First Lady were spotted near Oxford University on Friday and they are believed to be in town to celebrate their daughter Chelsea finishing her doctorate degree.

The storied school would only say that they are visiting in a 'private capacity' according to ABC News early Friday afternoon but it was later confirmed that they are there to celebrate their daughter's academic accomplishment.

Chelsea, 34, is scheduled to receive her doctorate three years after beginning the international relations program.

Casual Friday: Hillary and Bill Clinton were spotted at Oxford University this afternoon

Fun weekend: The couple are in town because their daughter Chelsea will be graduating from her doctorate program on Saturday after three years of work

Old stomping grounds: Mr Clinton spent a year studying at the school as part of a Rhodes Scholarship program after he received his undergraduate degree at Georgetown

Like her father, she first went to Oxford to get her master's degree immediately after her undergraduate studies at Stanford.

She returned to the U.S. after finishing her master's in 2003, but then started a second degree at the school in 2011.

She
 has been working on the dissertation focusing on international global 
governance structures with a focus on global health since then but doing
 the majority of the work in New York City.

The
 expectant mother, who announced that she is pregnant with her first 
child last month, has not yet been spotted in England but the graduation
 ceremony is set to take place on Saturday.

Bill Clinton got his undergraduate degree at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. but won a Rhodes Scholarship when he graduated and headed back to school.

He studied philosophy, politics and economics at University College at Oxford.

He never ended up earning a degree from the school because he left early and returned to the United States to study law at Yale, where he would meet his soon-to-be wife.

Though the couple apparently hoped to stay under the radar on today's trip, they have been pictured taking a leisurely stroll in the picturesque town.

Taking in the country: The former President stopped to snap a picture of a bull with his camera phone

Nothing unusual: The powerful political couple seemed like normal tourists with the hoards of security guards being the only tip off of their position

At one point, the former President stopped to take a picture of a bull who was behind a fence on the side of the road using the camera on his phone.

It doesn't look like that was intended to be shared, however.Â 

Both Clintons are active Twitter users but have kept their posts to a minimum and gave no hints about the intention of the trip on their social media accounts.

Bill Clinton must be feeling slightly nostalgic of late because he gave a speech at Georgetown nearly two weeks ago and turned to Twitter to thank the students for coming out to listen to his speech in spite of bad weather.
