It is one of the biggest processions in the British calendar - but for one member of yesterday's parade ahead of the State Opening of Parliament it was all too much.

As the Queen made her way from Buckingham Palace to the House of Lords just after 11am, six-year-old cavalry horse Musaqaleh had other plans.

The gelding, who joined the army's fleet 
two years ago, bolted - hurling his rider into the path of Her Majesty's
 bespoke new carriage just metres away.

Bolted! Musaqaleh, a six-year-old gelding, threw his rider off and fled 
his station outside Whitehall when the procession started for the State Opening of Parliament - just seconds before the Queen approached in her carriage. The rider wasn't injured and stood up and saluted the Queen as she passed

But incredibly, the unnamed trooper leaped to attention with his sword to salute the Queen as she passed.

Meanwhile, his black charger cantered wildly towards Horse Guards Parade, trying to find a way out of the metal gates that cordoned off the public.

Eventually, he came to a halt and four soldiers guided him back to his stable.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'Poor Musaqaleh just got spooked. It does ask quite a lot of them, these parades, particularly the young ones.

'Musaqaleh hasn't done many yet, he's only been with the army for two years. This parade had only been rehearsed once. You can see the (more experienced) ones which know what songs are coming next. Their ears prick forwards when they hear a song they like.

'But with the younger ones it is common for them to bound off. This week is big for them - they are doing 10 parades in as many days. It is a big ask.'

Hold your horses! Musaqaleh, who is still new to parades, galloped towards Horse Guards Parade trying to find a way out of the metal gates that cordoned off the public. He eventually came to a halt and four soldiers guided him back to his stable

Unlike the drum horses, the blacks and greys are all named with a common letter for each year.

An 'M-reg', Musaqaleh was named after a battle fought in Afghanistan in December 2007. Recruited in 2012, he underwent training to ignore the noise of London traffic and carry the weight of full ceremonial gear.

The
 Riding Master looks for animals that are no less than 16 hands high and
 unbroken, with a good weight,Â  good attitude and no blemishes.

They are then broken, ridden, and gradually trained with more and more ceremonial 'furniture' to build up their strength. It
 is only when they appear to have accepted the sound of the Regimental 
bands - and demonstrated this in a major parade - that a horse can 'pass
 out' to join the Regiment proper.

Procession: The Queen travelled to the House of Lords in the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach

Heavy duty: The parade was one of 10 in 10 days for the horses, who must calmly complete at least one major procession, not reacting to traffic or music, before they can 'pass out' into the Regiment proper
