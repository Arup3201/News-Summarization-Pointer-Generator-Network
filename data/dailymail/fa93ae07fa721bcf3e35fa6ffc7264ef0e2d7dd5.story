Unite's Len McCluskey attended a meeting where NHS 'leverage' campaign was allegedly proposed

Doctors have reacted with anger after leaked documents revealed plans by union militants to intimidate GPs over health reforms.

Unite's 'leverage team' – the dirty tricks unit which bullied managers and their families during last year’s Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Scotland – intends to deploy the same tactics against doctors involved in 'privatising' the NHS.

At a recent Unite executive meeting attended by controversial general secretary ‘red’ Len McCluskey, there was a proposal that ‘the next comprehensive leverage campaign will be focused on [the] defence of the National Health Service’.

According to leaked minutes, the leverage team suggested taking action at a ‘local level’ by using ‘direct intervention to... target private health care companies and commissioning bodies’.

Under the Government’s health reforms, the bodies, partly staffed by GPs, are responsible for putting local medical contracts out to tender – and are therefore seen by Left-wing opponents as being in the vanguard of privatisation.

During the Grangemouth dispute last autumn, the sinister leverage unit – staffed by campaigners who describe themselves as ‘industrial terrorists’ – personally targeted executives of the Ineos chemical company which owns the plant by sending mobs of protesters to their homes.

One director embroiled in the row over pay and conditions said he had feared for the safety of his wife and two young children after 30 Unite activists descended on his drive during the school holidays and told his neighbours that he was 'evil'.

And the daughter of another company boss had 'Wanted' posters denouncing her father posted through her front door in Hampshire.

Last night, Tory Health Minister Dan Poulter condemned Unite’s plan, saying: 'We take threats to doctors and nurses very seriously.'

'Unite may have walked all over Ed Miliband and taken over the Labour Party, but we will not let them do that to our NHS.'

Leading GP Michael Dixon, the president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, said: 'This plan is deeply worrying. It will be the patients who suffer from attempts to intimidate hard-working doctors.'

'Nobody deserves to be threatened just for trying to improve patient care.'

Last night, a Unite spokeswoman said that while the executive had discussed the plan, it was 'just a proposal.

She added that defending the NHS from the 'savagery' of the Government was 'one of the most serious issues facing the country'.
