A banker, his wife and their nine-year-old nephew have been gunned down in a drive-by shooting outside their home.

Benoit Philippens, a 37-year-old director at BNP Paribas Fortis, was targeted by gunmen who were waiting near his house in the Belgian city of Vise.

Mr Philippens and the boy were killed at the scene as the family pulled up on the driveway.

His
 wife Carol Haid, 37, who was also the boy's godmother, died of her 
injuries the next day after being struck three times in the back.

It is thought shots were fired with an automatic weapon from the gunmen's car before it sped off.

However, a bullet hole found in the window of a nearby sports centre suggested the shooter may have been waiting on the drive or by the house, according to a judicial source.

The gunmen, who struck on Friday, have not yet been traced nor has any motive been established for the shooting, it was reported by Zero Hedge which cited L'venir.

The Mayor of Vise, Marcel Neven, said the killings could be linked to Mr Philippens' profession.

A friend claims the banker was involved in an argument with a customer around six months ago in which he was threatened in public, according to Zero Hedge which cited the 7Dimanche newspaper.

According to neighbours, the couple had been married just over a year and had lived at the house for five or six years.

They said the shooting was particularly shocking because they were a normal family and that it was not linked to drugs.
