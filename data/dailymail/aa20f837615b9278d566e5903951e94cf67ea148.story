The five-man panel brought in by owner Shahid Khan to pick the next Fulham manager is in danger of becoming redundant after Kit Symons orchestrated a thrashing against Bolton.

The man in temporary charge led the club to three consecutive wins for the first time since March 2012 by annihilating their opponents.

That kind of form got them to the top flight in the first place and ensured they stayed there for 13 years.

They followed up victories against Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup and Birmingham at the weekend with this resounding result.

According to club sources only one of the panel, Fulham fan and Nike director David Daly, was at Craven Cottage for the match.

‘That performance certainly won’t do me any harm,’ Symons said afterwards, when asked about his chances.

‘The two things I set out to do when I came in were galvanise the club and start winning games. On both counts it’s going well.’

Symons revealed he has changed a lot around the club and their Motspur Park training ground since former manager Felix Magath was sacked in mid-September.

He added: ‘I sent an email out to our scouts because the information they’ve given us about opponents that we’ve passed on to the team is spot on. It gives the players belief.’

In the ninth minute they opened the scoring when centre-back Matt Mills slipped and the mistake allowed Hugo Rodallega to take a touch before burying the ball under goalkeeper Andy Lonergan.

They made it two in first-half stoppage time when Bryan Ruiz sent in a free kick and Fernando Amorebieta rose to head home.

It was three on 67 minutes when Rodallega broke down the right and carried the ball into the box before squaring to Lasse Vigen Christensen, who finished first time.

And the game was over when Tim Hoogland fired a fourth into the bottom corner in the 79th minute. By the time it went in, Fulham fans were chanting Symons’ name.

‘That was a brilliant feeling,’ Symons said. ‘I’ve had stadiums full booing me before when I was a player, so it was a nice.’

Bolton manager Dougie Freedman has won just once all season, but vowed to fight on. ‘I feel very confident I can do the job,’ he insisted.

Former Norwich boss Chris Hughton, Steve Clarke who was let go by West Bromwich Albion, Tim Sherwood who left Tottenham in the summer and ex-Middlesbrough manager Tony Mowbray are all rivalling Symons for the Fulham job.

Khan’s panel consists of former players Danny Murphy and Brian McBride, ex-Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn, academy director Huw Jenkins and Daly.

At the moment, there is only one name leaping out at them.
