Police are investigating how a two-year-old Colorado girl who spent New Years Eve in hospital came to test positive for THC, the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.

The incident started on Tuesday when Aida Hernandez stumbled upon her daughter eating a cookie left sitting in the front yard of an apartment complex in Longmont.

Hernandez told police she instructed the toddler to stop and throw the random sweet back in the garden.

This two-year-old girl (right, pictured with her sister) spent New Years Eve in hospital after eating a cookie that was placed with marijuana, police believe

Aida Hernandez noticed her daughter was acting strangely 'about half an hour' after finding her eating a random cookie out the front of their apartment block

Scene: Police are investigating the incident, but say they not found any reason to discredit the story provided to them by the family

Police say the two-year-old girl (right) has now fully recovered

The pair then went on a trip to the grocery store, when the mom realized something was wrong with her little girl.

'She was sleepy, she was opening and closing her eyes, and she couldnâ€™t walk very well,' Hernandez told FOX31 Denver.

A toxicology test was performed and her urine tested positive for THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

The incident occurred the day before Colorado ended prohibition laws on Marijuana.

As of January 1, adults 21 and over are able to buy the drug at dispensaries across the state, allowing people to smoke and eat weed in the privacy of their homes.

The toddler spent the night in hospital recovering and returned home on Wednesday. 

Marijuana is now legally sold in a variety of forms - from free-packaged to joints and edibles - as part of a new government experiment in regulating the drug like alcohol

Edible marijuana products, such as suckers (pictured), are regulated under new Colorado drug the same way as free-standing marijuana is, in terms of how much each adult is allowed in weight

Since marijuana sales started in Colorado, the most typical way to buy the drug is on its own, however joints and edibles are also available

Cmdr. Jeff Satur said a search of the family's home failed to turn up anything.

Hernandez is also being tested for THC.

'At this point we are believing the family,' Satur said.

Police are working with social service workers on the case.

There is another child in the home who was unharmed.
