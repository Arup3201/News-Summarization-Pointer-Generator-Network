Manchester United will be represented by Angel di Maria at tonight's Ballon D'or awards.

The Argentine's teammate Robin Van Persie pulled out of the gala in Switzerland as he is due to have a scan on his injured ankle today.

Van Persie, 31, is competing with Real Madrid's James Rodriguez and Republic of Ireland women's international Stephanie Roche for the Puskas Award, for the best goal after his diving header for Holland against Spain in the 2014 World Cup.

Angel di Maria will be Manchester United's only representative at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich

Van Persie tweeted: 'On advice of the club medical staff I am unable to fly out to Zurich to attend the Fifa Ballon d'Or gala for my nomination for the Puskas award.

'I will be watching it from home and my good friend Ruud Gullit will take the honours for me.'

Di Maria, who made UEFA's team of the year for the most assists notably from his time at Real Madrid, has travelled to Zurich with his wife Jorgelina Cardoso.

United agreed to pay an extra £4million to Real Madrid as part of Di Maria's transfer fee should he win the Ballon D'Or but their money looks safe for now.
