First picture: Public schoolboy Charlie Booth was found dead after apparently shooting himself with his father's gun

A 16-year-old private schoolboy has been found dead at home after apparently shooting himself with a gun belonging to his father.

Charlie Booth was described by the head teacher of £10,000-a-year Gad’s Hill School in Kent as an ‘outstanding’ pupil with a ‘bright future ahead of him’.

But the night before his death Charlie posted a message on Twitter saying: ‘Swear I get in s*** moods for no reason at the moment! Need to sort myself out.’

The teenager, whose body was found at the family’s £500,000 farmhouse on Friday night, indicated he was caught up in arguments.

A few weeks earlier he had written tweets saying ‘Everything seems to run into an argument’ and ‘hate being stuck in the middle of stuff’ and referred to ‘people that can’t keep quiet’.

Charlie’s mother Julia, 48, is a marketing assistant at nearby Cobham Hall boarding school and his father Nicholas, 52, is a director of a farm equipment supplier.

There was no answer at their large red-bricked detached home down a private country lane near the village of Cobham yesterday.

Charlie was a member of his school’s cadet force, in which pupils are trained in military activities including shooting.

Police confirmed his death was not being treated as suspicious, but would not say whether it was an accident or suicide.

The gun is believed to be licensed and Kent Police say they are not making any inquiries into the ownership of the weapon.

Charlie was a Year 11 pupil at £10,000-a year Gad's 
Hill School, based at the former home of Charles Dickens in Higham, Kent.

He was also a member of the school's 
Combined Cadet Force, which trains pupils in a range of military 
activities including shooting, survival training, rock climbing and 
taking part in assault courses.

His efforts in the cadets were 
praised in the Gadshillian newsletter after the schoolboy took part in a
cadet weekend at the Army's Lydd Firing Range in Kent last year.

During the events, which according to
the newsletter included 'weapons training, rock climbing and archery', 
cadets took part in 25m shooting range practice with semi-automatic 
L98A2 rifle, capable of 60-rounds-per-minute.

The newsletter stated: 'Adventures 
included the popular assault course, weapons training, rock climbing and
then shooting rounds on the 25-metre range. Charlie Booth proved himself as a pro on the assault course.'

Charlie tweeted about having bad moods and spoke of needing to 'sort myself out' the day before he died.

The tweet followed a succession of 
tweets from late February where the school boy claimed '@Charliebooth18 I
don't now why I feel like this' and 'Everything seems to turn into an 
argument.. :/.'

News of his death was announced to pupils by headteacher David Craggs
during assembly this morning.

Mr Craggs said: 'Charlie was a remarkable young man, who had such a bright future ahead of him.

'Our first thoughts are for Charlie's 
family and I can say with confidence, that they have the heartfelt 
support and condolences of the whole Gad's Hill community.

'It is at times like this - to quote 
recent comments by President Barack Obama - we will all hug our own 
children a little closer over the next few days.

'Charlie was able to distinguish himself above other cadets, showing 
great strength, initiative and leadership, and he was a great friend to 
so many.

In mourning: News of Charlie's death was announced to pupils by headteacher David Craggs (pictured) during assembly this morning

'Charlie was a friendly, enthusiastic, mature and self-confident student
with so much to live for - attributes that make this tragedy even more 
difficult to comprehend. He will be greatly missed.

'His loss leaves his family, our school and the wider Gad's community in
mourning and struggling to make sense of what has unfolded.'

He said Charlie joined Gad's in the 
Junior School and soon proved to be an outstanding student, contributing
greatly to all areas of school life and demonstrating 'huge talent' on 
the rugby and football fields and successfully competing for Gad's in 
cross-country events.

He added: 'He was an excellent 
ambassador for our school, an NCO in the School's Combined Cadet Force 
and was due embrace his passion for adventure and his love for the 
outdoors on a once-in-a-lifetime school expedition to Alaska this 
summer.'

On Twitter: Charlie spoke of having bad moods and needing to 'sort myself out' the day before his death

'You're in a better place now, bro': Friends took to Twitter to express their shock at Charlie's death

Mr Craggs said he has kept the school 
open today as a mark of respect to Charlie and his family and also to 
'unite in grief, helping and supporting his classmates and friends who 
may have been affected by his sudden death'.

He said: 'Charlie's legacy will live 
on in our fond memories of him and in the eternal love of his family. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his friends today.'

Charlie
lived with his parents in a large £300,000 country home along a private
country track on the outskirts of the village of Cobham.

It has a large front garden and two or three other smaller properties within its grounds.

Mrs Booth is a marketing assistant at nearby Cobham Hall, an international boarding school for girls aged between 11 and 18.

Mr Booth is a director of Palmers Agricultural, a farm equipment supplier with offices in Kent and East Sussex.

Location: Police were called to Charlie's home in Cobham at about 10.30pm on Friday after the boy's body was discovered

Quaint: Charlie was found by a member of his family at an address in the village of Cobham (above, file picture), near Gravesend, Kent

Resident Ann Greenstreet said: 'I 
know the family through the sports fields, Charlie's dad Nick is really 
involved in the cricket club.

'It is terrible news, quite shocking - it is awful to think something so terrible can happen to some one so young.'

No-one was answering at Charlie's house today.

A neighbour said: 'I know they're not in because they told me they were going away for a few days.'

His friends took to Twitter to pay tribute and express their shock today.

Simon Till said: 'RIP Charlie Booth. A 
great friend from primary school and I used to love going round in the 
summer. Your in a better place now bro.'

Kelly Austin tweeted: 'Rip charlie booth, gone but never forgotten!'

Louis J Lowell said: 'Horrible news. In tears and complete shock- RIP Charlie Booth, gone but never forgotten.'

Historic: Dickens used the half-timbered pub Leather Bottle in Cobham in his novel Pickwick Papers

Police were called to his home at about 10.30pm on Friday after the boy's body was discovered.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'We can 
confirm we attended an address in Cobham at 10.30pm and a 16-year-old 
boy was pronounced dead.'

An inquest is expected to open later today.

A spokesman for the South East Coast Ambulance Service said: 'We can confirm we were called to a private address at around 10.30pm on Friday. Sadly the patient died at the scene.'

He did not confirm whether the teenager had died before paramedics arrived.

Dickens made Gad's Hill Place his home in 1856 and penned classic novels including Great Expectations there.

In the 1920s, the property was converted into a school for girls.

Then, in the 1980s, the school admitted boys into its kindergarten and junior school, and in 2001 became fully co-educational and admitted boys throughout the school.
