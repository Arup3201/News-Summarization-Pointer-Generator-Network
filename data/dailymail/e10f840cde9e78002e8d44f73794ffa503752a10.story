Blackpool 1-2 Blackburn 

Rudy Gestede bagged a brace to hand Blackburn their first win of the season and keep Blackpool searching for theirs.

Gestede netted either side of half-time while Tomasz Cywka's effort just before the hour was a mere consolation as Jose Riga's side's miserable start to the season continued. 

After opening the season with a 1-1 draw with Cardiff, Blackburn are now up and running in the Championship while Blackpool are still seeking to open their account after three defeats in all competitions.

Heads: Rudy Gestede heads his second goal for Blackburn to pile on the misery for Blackpool

French striker Gestede gave Rovers the lead after 26 minutes, He picked up the pieces after Josh King, Jason Lowe and Tom Cairney combined to beat Joe Lewis in the home goal. 

He doubled his tally just after the break when he headed in Craig Conway's cross. 

Midfielder Tomasz Cywka scored his first for the club to give the Tangerines a ray of hope after Paul Robinson spilled his tame shot after 53 minutes.

But Blackburn held on to pile the pressure on the beleaguered Riga and his team.

Bolton 2-2 Nottingham Forest  

Britt Assombalonga went some way to repaying his £5 million transfer fee with his first goals for Nottingham Forest as they twice came from behind to draw at Bolton. 

Joe Mason's header gave the Trotters the lead after just four minutes but Assombalonga's close-range finish cancelled out the advantage after 27. 

That sparked a flurry of goals as David Wheater when he slotted in before the former Peterborough striker coolly converted a penalty after he was brought down by Wheater.

Rotherham 1-0 Wolves 

Lewis Hall scored the only goal of the game for Rotherham to secure their first points since returning to the second tier, beating fellow new boys Wolves.
