 A dime-sized endangered spider found at a Texas construction site has wound up tripling the cost of a planned new highway and delaying the project for years.

A Bracken Cave meshweaver spider, only the second ever recorded by man, was discovered in a cave that San Antonio crews unearthed while building a highway in 2012.

Years later, the project originally slated for completion in 2012 has yet to break ground and is projected to cost at least $45 million by the time it's done.

Big headache: A Bracken Cave meshweaver spider, only the second ever recorded by man, was discovered in a cave that San Antonio crews unearthed while building a highway in 2012

Stopped everything: The spider was only the second ever seen, but it had previously been placed on the endangered species list, so construction of the $15 million highway stopped abruptly

The original budget was $15 million. And ground won't even be broken until 2015.

An underpass originally planned is being replaced with an overpass to accommodate the spider, known by its Latin name Cicurina Venii.

So what's so special about this tiny, blind bug?

'The thing that was unique about this spider is that it had been seen only once before in recorded history,' Josh Donat, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Transportation, told the San Antonio Express-News.

The last time a person had seen the spider was in 1980 in northwestern Bexar County.

But that one time was enough to get the meshweaver placed on the federal endangered species list in 2000.

Which means big headaches for contractors, crews and some locals.

'I think that kind of tripling of infrastructure cost is a complete budget buster. 'Patrick Natale, executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, told CBS News.

Comptroller Susan Combs agreed.

'When they're told that there is a dime-sized spider, which nobody had ever heard of, and it's going to maybe cost lives because of ambulances or you can't get to work, they don't understand it. They don't see its value and they're shaking their heads,' she said.

Costly: The project was slated to be finished in 2012 but now won't even break ground until 2015, and at a cost of at least three times the original $15 million cost

Biologists ordered the cave sealed, work stopped and the construction contract was terminated

Years and at least $30million later, the project will finally break ground in 2015, though it was originally slated for completion in 2012
