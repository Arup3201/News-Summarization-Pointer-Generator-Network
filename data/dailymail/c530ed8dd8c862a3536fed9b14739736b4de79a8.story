Same-sex marriage is one step closer to being legal in North Carolina. And for one elderly couple, time is of the essence.

Ellen 'Lennie' Gerber and Pearl Berlin of High Point are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit against the Tar Heel State's gay-marriage ban. They've been together 48 years.

At 89 and in fragile health, Berlin doesn't know how much longer she can wait. The retired educator has been hospitalized several times in the past two years, including for a fall in December that broke three ribs.

On the summer night Gerber and Berlin committed to spending their lives together, the No. 1 song was 'When A Man Loves A Woman.'

Lyndon B. Johnson was president. NASA had just landed the first unmanned probe on the moon.

'We're
 still in love, after 48 years,' Gerber, better known as Lennie, said 
recently. 'We still can't begin the day without a good cuddle.'

June
 2, 1966, is engraved in Roman numerals on the identical gold bands the 
women exchanged during a religious wedding at their Greensboro synagogue
 last year on the anniversary of that long-ago night. They followed 
three months later with a civil ceremony in Maine.

But under North Carolina law, they might as well be strangers.

That's
 why Gerber and Berlin are the lead plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging 
the state's voter-approved constitutional amendment banning legal 
recognition of same-sex relationships.

'They can see that in us, that being 
gay or lesbian is just the same as being straight,' Gerber said. 'You 
just love somebody of your own sex. Otherwise, there's no difference. 
... We want to be recognized for what we are — a married couple.'

Last
 month, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals — with jurisdiction over five 
states, including North Carolina — struck down Virginia's same-sex 
marriage ban. On Wednesday, the appellate panel refused to delay its 
ruling, possibly clearing the way for gay marriages to begin next week 
in the Old Dominion.

North 
Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper has said it would be 'futile' to 
continue defending his state's similar law. Republican Governor Pat 
McCrory and GOP legislative leaders urged Cooper, a Democrat, to 
continue the fight, but gave no indication they will defend the ban 
themselves.

There are real-world worries that come with being gay and growing older. And time is not on the High Point couple's side.

Berlin,
 89, fell down some stairs before Christmas, hitting her head, breaking 
three ribs and enduring her third hospital stay in two years.

Gerber, a 78-year-old retired lawyer,
 long ago drafted Berlin's health-care power of attorney. But a piece of
 paper is no guarantee hospital staff would immediately afford her the 
same spousal rights that would be automatic if she were married to a 
man.

'It's very scary, that
 something could happen to Pearl and I could be kept from her,' Gerber 
said. 'They might not let me in the emergency room with her. They might 
not let me help make decisions. ... It would be just horrendous if I 
wasn't able to be there with her, holding her hand. I would die if I 
couldn't do that.'

Since 
the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key section of the federal Defense 
of Marriage Act last year, same-sex marriage proponents around the 
country won nearly two dozen legal victories. Such marriages are now 
allowed in 19 states and the District of Columbia.

Legal
 experts predict North Carolina's first same-sex marriage licenses could
 be issued within months, depending on the legal process.

But
 Gerber and Berlin worry they might not have much time. Their lawyers 
plan to file a brief asking a federal judge in Greensboro to grant 
immediate recognition to same-sex marriages.

'Marriage
 is a statement that you make in front of your family, your friends, 
your community. It has a meaning that tells the world who you are. It's a
 very fundamental part of someone's identity,' Gerber said.

The walls of the home they built in 
High Point are covered with art and photos from their adventures. They 
visited all seven continents, even mingling with penguins on an 
Antarctic ice shelf.

Berlin is a perfectionist. Gerber admits she's something of a slob.

They
 met in 1964, when Gerber visited a friend in Detroit who invited Berlin
 for brunch. Berlin taught at Wayne State University. Gerber was headed 
to graduate school at the University of Southern California.

It
 wasn't love at first sight, but they had a lot in common. They both 
taught physical education. They were both 'nice Jewish girls from 
Brooklyn.' They'd never had much interest in boys.

'I
 had a crush on every female camp counselor I ever had. On every Girl 
Scout leader. On a couple of my teachers,' Gerber said. 'I came home 
from my first summer where I was at camp for a month, and I wrote, "I 
love Sandy," on every page of my diary.'

Over
 the next two years, with frequent calls and visits, their friendship 
evolved into love. Gerber landed a job at Berlin's college.

On the long drive moving Gerber to 
Michigan, they stopped at a motel. Conversation turned to where Gerber 
would live. That night, they decided to move in together.

They
 didn't tell their families they were a couple, but didn't hide it. They
 lived in a one-bedroom apartment. Gerber's mother offered to buy a 
second bed. They declined. She started buying Berlin pajamas.

'She
 said, "We will never condone this,"' Gerber recounted. 'But she got to 
the point where she could laugh when I said, "But Mother. You always 
said all you cared about was that I marry a Jew, and I did."'

Berlin
 had inadvertently outed herself years earlier, mistakenly sending her 
mother a love letter she had written to a woman. Her mother called.

'And
 she says, "Pearl, I just want to tell you something. I just finished 
reading today's mail, and I just read your letter to Marian. It was very
 well written. I know you did not intend it for me. I want you to know 
your father will never see it and never hear a word about it."'

Eventually, even Berlin's father accepted their relationship, telling Gerber: 'Lennie. If you were a man, this would all be perfect,' Gerber recounted.

Berlin moved to a college in Massachusetts, and Gerber got work there too. Then, in 1971, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro asked Berlin to run a new doctoral program.

Gerber said school administrators made it clear they would never hire her.

'They said we were "too open,"' Gerber said. 'You were supposed to pretend.'

So Gerber went to law school and became a legal aid lawyer. Later, she helped gay and lesbian couples draft wills, powers of attorney and fill out tax returns.

Still, no legal document can provide the same protections as a marriage certificate. Gerber recounts cases where relatives fought deceased people's gay partners over their estates, or excluded them from funerals.

While that isn't a concern for Gerber, she worries Berlin's death certificate will list her marital status as single.

'I think anybody who had lost a spouse would be devastated if somebody said, "Eh, this isn't your spouse."'

Berlin chuckles at talk of her demise. She already has picked the font for invitations to their golden anniversary party — on June 2, 2016.
