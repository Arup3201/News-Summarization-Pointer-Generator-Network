Argentina will need to improve in their next World Cup games despite having 'genius' Lionel Messi, coach Alejandro Sabella has admitted.

Messi's scored a last-gasp winner to give Argentina a 1-0 win over Iran on Saturday and guarantee them progress to the knockout stages from Group F.

That was the four-time Ballon d'Or winner's second goal of the tournament, after he also scored the winner against Bosnia in Argentina's opener.

'Genius': Messi was Argentina's matchwinner again, but Sabella is looking for improvement

Challenge: Sabella wants more from his players after they only just managed to beat Iran 1-0

Messi's ability to drag Argentina to victory despite average performances in their first two games has drawn comparisons to Diego Maradona in 1986.

And Sabella praised his matchwinner from both games - but said Argentina's other players must improve if they are to have any chance of realising their dreams of lifting the World Cup in the Maracana.

'We want to improve obviously,' Sabella said. 'There are many things we have to think about and improve.

'All players who played today have contributed to this victory but of course we have a genius who is called Messi. Fortunately he is Argentine. Everybody would have liked to have Messi but it is us who have him.'

Wonder strike: Sabella said two goalkeepers couldn't stop Messi, so no wonder Alireza Haghighi struggled

After a frustrating 90 minutes against the gutsy Iranians, Messi broke the deadlock with a delightful curling shot in stoppage time to the delight of tens of thousands of Argentine fans at the Estadio Mineirao.

'It was a very difficult match and Iran played a great World Cup match. But that last play from Lionel, no one could have stopped it. Not even two goalkeepers could have stopped that Lionel shot,' Sabella said.

Argentina, among the title favourites in Brazil, played below par for the second consecutive game after narrowly winning their opener against Bosnia 2-1.

They may have secured qualification to the round of 16 but Sabella, who had fielded an attacking formation with Gonzalo Higuain, Messi, Sergio Aguero and Angel Di Maria, said they would analyse what had not worked that well, including breaking past the Iranians down the wings.

Leaving the rest behind: Messi celebrates his goal, but Argentina were underwhelming in Belo Horizonte

'This sort of thing can happen, it shouldn't but it does,' said the Argentine, who won the Copa Libertadores in the Belo Horizonte stadium with Estudiantes in 2009.

'Of course we always want to win, obviously, so we will try to strike a balance in the next games but it is not always easy,' he said.

'Sometimes during counter-attacks we decide a match but today things got a little difficult with our counter-attacks, I want to congratulate Iran because they played a brilliant game.'
