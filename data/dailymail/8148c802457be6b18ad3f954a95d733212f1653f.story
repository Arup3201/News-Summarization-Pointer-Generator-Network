A plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a group of drunken Scots sparked chaos on a Ryanair 
flight from Prestwick Airport to Ibiza.

Police
said 14 men had been thrown off the plane at Beauvais airport north of Paris on Tuesday evening and questioned by authorities.

French
police are reported to have claimed the group were so inebriated they 
thought they had landed in Ibiza when the aircraft touched down in 
Paris.

Their antics onboard the Ryanair flight became so out of control the pilot alerted French air bosses that he would be making an emergency landing

It is thought the 
group had been drinking alcohol bought from duty free at Prestwick 
Airport before becoming rowdy on the flight.

Their
antics became so out of control the pilot alerted French air bosses 
that he would be making an emergency landing and diverted to Beauvais 
carrying 174 passengers.

The
plane eventually took off again without the partying passengers who are
thought to have been released in the early hours of Wednesday and 
directed to a Beauvais train station to go to Paris.

According
to Beauvais airport management the Ryanair crew made an official 
complaint against the Scots who could face charges at a later date.

Ryanair today confirmed their pilot had been forced to take action and that the French police had been called in.

A
source said: 'I know a guy whose brother was on the flight. He said it 
had been diverted to Paris to throw off a group of young guys who were 
running wild.

'He said the police came on board but the guys refused to get off. Eventually they were taken off.

'The flight was delayed in Paris but eventually got on its way. Apparently it was chaotic.'

Ryanair’s
Robin Kiely said: 'A Ryanair flight from Glasgow Prestwick to Ibiza 
diverted into Paris Beauvais after a small group of passengers became

disruptive on-board.

'On arrival, police removed and detained these 14 individuals.

'Ryanair
apologised to the other 160 passengers for any inconvenience and delay 
to their journey, but will not tolerate unruly or disruptive passengers.

'This matter is now being dealt with by the French police.'

Their drunken antics echo those of another group who also caused chaos in August.

Up to 30 men ran amok on a Ryanair flight to the holiday hotspot from Prestwick.

They guzzled spirits, jumped on seats, shouted, swore and threatened crew and passengers.

Their alcohol-fuelled rampage only ended when the pilot threatened to divert to Paris.

Spanish police were called on to the flight when it landed and it is understood they removed five members of the group.
