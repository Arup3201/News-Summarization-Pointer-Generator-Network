A 'full of life' 100-year-old great-grandmother died after falling 5ft out of a body sling that her two foreign carers were not trained to use, an inquest heard today.

May Ward died of multiple injuries after falling out of a sling her carers - from China and Bulgaria - were using to hoist her out of bed at Meppershall Care Home in Bedfordshire in August 2010.

Shasha Wei and Rumyana Ivanova, who have now left the country, had not been trained to use the new type of sling introduced to the home three months before, Hatfield Coroner's Court was told.

Ms Ward, who was a former London pub landlady, sustained multiple skull fractures, a broken leg, a black eye, and other cuts and bruises after she fell out of the sling at the care home.

The carers then put her back into bed and changed her clothes, which could have made Ms Ward's injuries worse, the inquest heard.

After a 40-minute delay between Ms Ward's fall and an ambulance arriving, the former Royal Air Force cook was taken to hospital, but died the following day.

Ruth Boulton, the Health and Safety Executive's investigating inspector, said the sling, which Ms Ward would have sat on all day, was different to the slings more commonly used around the home.

It should have been safer and if used properly it would be highly unlikely that Ms Ward would have fallen out, the inquest heard.

Ms Boulton said without training and instructions, it is likely that carers would revert to techniques used on the more common slings, but that were incorrect for this particular sling.

There were also questions about whether Ms Ward, a dementia sufferer, should have been hoisted out of bed as some staff referred to her as being ‘agitated’ at the time - which Ms Boulton said should have stopped her carers trying to lift her out of bed.

'People understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue. There can also be issues with English as a second language. Some cultures are more questioning. Other cultures, if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise'

She told the court: ‘You have general moving and handling training on one sort of sling and one sort of hoist but not the sling used for May.

‘That type of sling is quite unusual. The majority of slings are quite different to that and are used differently. The majority are not sit-on slings. If you don't have instructions you would revert to the generic use.’

Ms Boulton said some of the care home staff had received training from the sling's manufacturer, but that no formal training was given.

She added that information on how to use the sling should have been written on the whiteboard in Ms Ward's room.

Communication did not appear to be an issue for the carers, as they did not need interpreters in police interviews, DC Philip Freebrey told the court.

But Ms Boulton said in past cases, cultural differences could have been an issue.

She told the court: ‘What has been found is that people understand what to do but not why they need to do it and that can be an issue.

May Ward's son, John Ward, said she was born 
in West Tottenham, north London, and met her husband William Ward while 
she was a cook in the RAF.

Her
husband died in 1989, after the two had successful careers as 
publicans. Ms Ward has four grandchildren and six great grand-children - 
three girls and three boys, her son said.

She
and her husband initially ran a country club and a pub in west London 
before taking over the Prince William Henry pub in Blackfriars, central 
London, according to Mr Ward.

They
retired in 1980 and moved to Kenton, Middlesex, and Ms Ward was taken 
into care in 2004.

‘There can also be issues with English as a second language. Some cultures are more questioning. Other cultures, if they are told to do something they will do it until they are told otherwise.’

The care home manager at the time, Judith Eglen, was sacked in the wake of Ms Ward's death, the inquest heard.

She began work at the home in December 2009, around the same time it received a zero-star, or ‘poor’, rating in a Care Quality Commission inspection report, the jury heard.

That was uprated by the watchdog to a one-star rating in May 2010, around three months before Ms Ward's death and around the same time the new slings were purchased.

Ms Eglen told the court that she and the two carers involved re-enacted the lead-up to Ms Ward's fall for her family and the deputy manager a few days after her death.

She said Ms Ward was dropped from about 5ft but the carers were ‘good’ at their jobs.

‘Our conclusion (after re-enacting the fall) was that they did everything correctly but they moved too quickly,’ Ms Eglen told the court.

Earlier, coroner Edward Thomas told the jury Ms Ward was a lover of the music of the 1930s and 1940s. He described her as a ‘publican of the old school’, saying she ‘kept a good house’.

The inquest was adjourned until tomorrow.
