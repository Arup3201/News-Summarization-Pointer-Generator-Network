A series of shocking confessions from alleged Apple employees across the U.S. have revealed a workplace where employees claim to smash iPads for fun, trade electronics for plastic surgery and outright steal computers as well as customers' personal information.

'We would "field test" things in the back,' one of several anonymous former Apple employees revealed to Gizmodo of their destructive behaviour this week. 'Most people would throw phones on the ground, slide them across the floor, and once we tried to see who could get the biggest crack.'

The iPhones, iPads and other devices, all within the hundreds of dollars in shelf price, were all replaceable and without cost to the employees, according to their claims.

That's precisely what lead to their mischief they said.

'I had an extra phone lying around with a single crack, so we played football around the back of the store for a while, and when we were done, we just created what's known as a CS code for it and swapped it with a brand spanking new phone,' another wrote to the website.

'My management is so corrupt it goes beyond the retail stores,' another wrote in.

Calls from MailOnline to an Apple representatives were not immediately returned.

In August two former employees of a Texas store - whose astonishing recounts over the summer launched this latest national report - wrote of their corporate regional manager’s trade of computers for plastic surgery.

According to the unidentified source, they would allegedly provide heavily discounted Apple computers to a local plastic surgeon so that the female employee could receive a complimentary stomach stapling procedure in return.

'She made quid pro quo an art,' that employee identified as Jake said.

Behind the scenes in Apple's Genius Bar - dubbed 'the best place to get support for Apple products' according to Apple - it was an entirely other scene according to a slew of similar reports.

In a popular note by the store’s alleged tech employees referred to as ‘geniuses’ by the company – much like Best Buy’s tech department is run by the so-called Geek Squad - customers' personal information was, like their products photographed smashed on the floor, not always so safe.

'...The first thing we'd do is ask for a passcode and say we were going to open it in the back...' one wrote to Gizmodo.

'If you were a hot chick getting files moved, guarantee that your files were getting looked through for pictures and video. That is how we discovered one of our customers ran an adult website,' another claimed.

They claim any nude or provocative photos
and/or videos would be promptly shared around the store, some allegedly
saved for ‘private use.’

But as Gizmoto continues, alleged drug use in the stores made iToys not the only white items found in some stores.

'I can tell you that at the store I most recently worked at there was a guy who would sell drugs and be basically the main supplier for all of the store ... I knew he supplied anything from Pot, to Ecstasy and coke,' they write.

That employee claimed the alleged drug 
dealer was never fired despite repeatedly showing up to work while high,
or frequently not showing up at all. They hinted the employee having a 
father in the business as a support.

Following August’s first report in Gizmodo described
as tackling ‘the most corrupt Apple Store in America,’ readers chimed 
in to provide contrasting claims of atrocious and unethical behaviour, 
arguing that not all Apple stores are like this.

An Apple store Genius who admitted to swapping out customers' CPUS and hard-drives for cheaper parts for a quick buck, had this to say about his behaviour:

'Apple is the one to blame. You [have] no idea the miracles we have to do on some computers and iToys for 16 dollars a hour. I do not regret it at all.'

Another former employee from Bethesda wrote: 'What does matter to me is that Apple, a company I love and hold stock in, do business ethically.'
