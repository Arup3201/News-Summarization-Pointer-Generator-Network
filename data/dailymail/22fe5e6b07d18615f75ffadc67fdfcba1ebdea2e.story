A lesbian madam who forced a talented athlete into prostitution while running a ‘high class’ escort agency serving London’s most upmarket areas is facing jail.

Tatiana Shmyrova, 45, exploited the former record-breaking Bulgarian runner, after she was lured to Britain with the promise of a new life.

Shmyrova’s son, Artyom, convinced the alleged victim to move to the UK after they enjoyed a holiday romance in her homeland.

She was one of a number of girls whose sexual services were enjoyed by wealthy punters including doctors and businessmen, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Russian-born Shmyrova set up a business 
arrangement with Natalia Cannon, 34, and estranged husband William, 52, 
to advertise sex workers for sale on their website.

The three were found guilty of all counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation after a four-week trial.

Natalia Cannon, and William Cannon, denied charges of conspiracy to traffic persons into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation as part of the alleged prostitution ring, but were found guilty by a jury

Natalia Cannon was said to have spent her profits on a lavish lifestyle that included a riverside apartment in Chelsea, designer clothing from Prada, Gucci and Versace, and jewellery and watches from Cartier

Shmyrova,
 Natalia and William Cannon, had all denied conspiracy to traffic 
persons into the United Kingdom for sexual exploitation.

Both
 Cannons and Michael Poole, of north London, denied conspiracy to 
control prostitution for gain and Natalia Cannon also denied possessing 
£13,899.79 in criminal property.

Shymrova’s lover, Irina Bespalova, 32, organised photoshoots of the working girls. The court heard Bespalova was her ‘partner in work and love’.

Crown lawyer Riel Karmy-Jones said they were all part of a ‘ruthless’ sex ring which ran a lucrative business ‘by bartering in human beings and human bodies’.

The
 prosecutor described Shmyrova as a ‘modern day madam’, adding: ‘She 
lives her life through prostitution - but organising prostitutes through
 largely the mechanism of the internet.

‘She
 was mainly involved in the prostitution network through her work as a 
photographer, conducting photo shoots with the working girls to supply 
advertising pictures,’ Miss Karmy-Jones added.

Michael Poole, 28, was hired as a 'fixer' to ensure prostitutes were willing to carry out client demands

A number 
of others were also involved in the alleged prostitution ring. Michael Poole, 28, was hired by Shmyrova 
as a ‘fixer’ to ensure that prostitutes were ready and willing to carry 
out clients’ demands.

Ryzard Goreki, 37, was employed as a driver while Jerzy Molczun, 26, worked as a receptionist and 'heavy'.

They all face prison when they are sentenced tomorrow.

The victim, who was privately educated, achieved a record when competing in a race when she was just a teenager. But she chose not to pursue a sporting career and went on to work in a series of low-paid jobs.

She believed she would be working as a tour guide in London, sobbing as she told of her shame at having to sell her body after being ‘pushed into prostitution’.

‘He said I don’t need any money when I come here so when I arrived in London, I did not have a penny even, I was vulnerable.

‘I was scared, I didn’t know what is going to happen because he didn’t explain anything to me.

‘For me it is not important to have money and all those things like that,' she said.

‘I prefer to have a normal job so I can feel proud of myself, not ashamed of myself, like now.

Police smashed the sex ring, which began in October 2012, after launching an undercover sting in February last year.

Officers discovered the victim was being housed in an alleged brothel in southwest London.

Officers used the brothel's website to identify other west London addresses.

Many of the defendants were found guilty of their roles in the business after a trial at Southwark Crown Court

A further count against Natalia Cannon of failing to comply with a disclosure, in relation to a four digit code for an Apple iPad, was left on the court file.

Bespalova, Gorecki, and Molczun all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to control prostitution for gain prior to the trial.

Artyom Shmyrova is believed to be out of British jurisdiction in Russia and is not subject to any charges.
