Nigella Lawson was effectively put on trial without a lawyer, her furious brother claims today.

The TV cook was falsely portrayed as 'permanently drug-dazed' and 'addled by narcotics', Dominic Lawson says.

The court did not let her present evidence to defend herself, treating her instead as an 'object to be paraded and tormented during ten hours of cross-examination as a key prosecution witness.

Writing in today's Daily Mail, Mr Lawson likens her treatment to the burning of heretics in the Spanish Inquisition and warns that the 'vicious' treatment of prosecution witnesses is a threat to British justice because it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence.

He says his sister was 'heroic' in the face of such treatment but that the circus surrounding the fraud trial of her former aides has left the public under the impression she was the defendant.

Yesterday defence minister Anna Soubry told the BBC it was 'disgraceful' that the allegations and the collapse of Miss Lawson's marriage to advertising guru Charles Saatchi were played out in a courtroom.

'Nigella Lawson quite properly complains that she feels that she's on trial,' said the Tory MP. 'I just find it utterly appalling.'

Lawyers for Miss Lawson's former housekeepers Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo questioned the 53-year-old about her drug use in an attempt to show she sanctioned the sisters' £685,000 spending in return for their silence.

Miss Lawson admitted taking cocaine seven times. She admitted she had also smoked cannabis during the collapse of her 'doomed' marriage but insisted she was not a long-term or habitual user. She said she had been drug free since leaving the relationship.

Giving evidence at Isleworth Crown Court in West London, Miss Lawson said she had faced 'a long summer of bullying and abuse' which she said had been 'dedicated to salvaging Mr Saatchi's reputation and savaging mine'.

As her two former housekeepers were acquitted of a £685,000 card fraud, Miss Lawson said she had been 'vilified' by the court process despite having done all she could to alert the Crown Prosecution Service to a 'sustained background campaign deliberately designed to destroy my reputation'.

She said she had been made to feel she was on trial without any legal protection or representation, adding: 'I did my civic duty, only to be maliciously vilified without the right to respond.'

Her brother says she was given no advice or support by the CPS and – as a witness and not a defendant – was not entitled to a lawyer to represent her.

Mr Lawson writes: 'I would say that her conduct in the witness box was heroic. It was especially heroic given the way what was meant to be a formal examination of transactions by two employees had turned into a media circus – or rather an auto da fe – with this prosecution witness as the object to be paraded and tormented.'

He adds: 'The process of justice is seriously damaged if the system makes testifying intolerable for prosecution witnesses.'

Mr Lawson's warning follows several high-profile trials which have raised questions about the treatment of prosecution witnesses, including violinist Frances Andrade who committed suicide after giving evidence against a teacher who sexually abused her as a child.

The parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler also faced detailed questions about their private lives from a lawyer representing her killer Levi Bellfield during his trial.

Miss Soubry said it was 'disgraceful' that the collapse of a marriage should have played out in a courtroom and took aim at Charles Saatchi, saying the saga began with the 'Throttlegate' photographs of him grabbing Miss Lawson by the throat at a Mayfair restaurant.

'The whole thing is disgraceful. I think we're beginning to lose the plot in this country,' she said.

'This started with an unfortunate divorce. It started with a photograph of her being assaulted by her husband. So out in public was played what should have been a very private and very distressing moment.

'As a result of that they became divorced. These criminal proceedings had already begun, back in 2012.'
