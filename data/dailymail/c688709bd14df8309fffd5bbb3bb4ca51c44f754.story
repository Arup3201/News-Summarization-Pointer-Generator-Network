It is 6.30am on the A1 just outside of Durham. Four lifelong followers of Sunderland Association Football Club are in a Peugeot 508, the Sat Nav loaded for the railway town of Eastleigh in Hampshire.

The mood is one of optimism. For the past fortnight the Black Cats have been purring in the wake of their 3-1 win victory over Stoke.

Paul Dobson – the 58-year-old assistant editor of the fanzine A Love Supreme – and his three pals spend the next six hours debating team selection – Jordi Gomez versus Jack Rodwell – and tactics – two up front versus lone frontman Steven Fletcher. As the quartet will later learn, it matters not.

They arrive at their Travelodge in Eastleigh, settle the £60 room rate, square up £20 a man for petrol and dish out the match tickets - a relatively reasonable £24 each – leaving £50 in their back pocket for a few beers – they’ ll certainly need them as the day transpires.

They then jump on a train to Southampton where they join 2,500 fellow supporters for Saturday afternoon’s game at St Mary’s Stadium. And so the nightmare begins.

By 3.20pm their side are trailing by two, the first an absolute belter of a volley from Santiago Vergini. The Argentine, however, is a Sunderland defender rather than a Southampton striker.

Just over an hour later it is 5-0. ‘At 5-0 we were angry,’ reflects Dobson. Come full-time, however, fury had made way for gallows humour, the scoreboard reading a humiliating 8-0.

‘It was just comedic come the end,’ Dobson continues. ‘We were just laughing at how bad it was – it had gone way past being angry.

‘In a perverse way we actually started supporting the team and the away end was bouncing – some things never cease to amaze me.

‘A few of the players came over to applaud – the goalkeeper Vito Mannone was nearly crying – but a couple of them were down the tunnel faster than they’d moved all day.

‘It was a shocking performance, as bad as I’ve seen.’

So had 90 minutes ruined an entire weekend? ‘Yes,’ Dobson returns without hesitation. ‘The match completely spoilt the day.

‘It was embarrassing. The own goals were comical. The first one, a striker would have been proud of it, and that set the tone for the day really.’

The crestfallen Mannone later insisted the players should refund fans who made the trek to the South Coast.

‘I would rather they’d just put on a performance and got three points,’ Dobson – a retired engineer, father of two and grandfather of two - says of Mannone’s suggestion.

‘But it would be a nice gesture I suppose – money back or tickets for a game in the future.’

Tickets for a game in the future? ‘Yeah, of course, I’ll still be going home and away,’ he counters.

‘It was like being punched in the face and yeah, it was horrible, but we’ll be back. That’s what you do.

‘We held the post-mortem over a few beers on Saturday night. Thankfully, we missed the start of Match of the Day because we were first on.

‘We drove back up yesterday and didn’t even mention the game. I think we all just wanted to get home as soon as possible.’

Home – that is probably where they wish they had stayed all along.
