Bafetimbi Gomis may not score often in the Premier League, but his goals tend to leave a lasting impression. They come late, they decide matches, and they present the opposition with questions to ponder.

Gomis, playing his second match since collapsing at White Hart Lane, struck three minutes from time at Villa Park to prick the bubble blown by Tim Sherwood. This was the second time in his short tenure Aston Villa have lost at home to a goal in the closing stages. It keeps Villa within the pull of the relegation zone when it had looked, after consecutive wins and reaching Wembley, an upward trajectory was gathering.

For Gomis, it was a third goal of the Premier League campaign. His first came 12 minutes from time to beat Arsenal in November, bringing scrutiny on Arsene Wenger.

His second felled Manchester United in the 73rd minute of their February encounter, casting doubt on the Louis Van Gaal philosophy.

This strike, while leaving Sherwood perplexed, helped suggest there is life after Wilfried Bony for Swansea. The limelight has switched to Gomis since Bony left for Manchester City with £28million going the other way.

At times he has struggled to escape the shadow cast by his predecessor. Grave concerns were raised when he lay motionless against Tottenham three weeks ago, before it emerged he has a vasovagal condition which causes low blood pressure and fainting episodes.

On Saturday, he missed three good chances. But he kept going and rounded off a lovely goal with a predatory finish.

Wayne Routledge danced into space in the middle of the pitch and released Jefferson Montero with a cultured pass. The rapid winger, on as a substitute, hit top gear to race past Leandro Bacuna and crossed with the outside of his right boot.

Despite being tugged back by Ciaran Clark, Gomis connected to plant a firm shot past Brad Guzan. Sherwood, who saw his side lose to Stoke in injury time of his Villa debut, was in terse mood afterwards. Defeat hurts him deeply.

'That's the second time it's happened now,' he said. 'There comes a time in a game when if you're looking like not winning it you make sure you don't lose it. We have to try and address that.'

It was a close match. Swansea bossed the first half, Villa shaded the second.

In the 57th minute Gabby Agbonlahor thought he had scored when Christian Benteke's header fell his way four yards out. But Neil Taylor blocked brilliantly. 

Scott Sinclair and Fabian Delph both sent good openings wide and Sinclair almost found an equaliser in added time when volleying inches over the bar.

By now Benteke had gone off because of a niggling hip problem and Swansea could have extended their winning margin when Routledge ran free close to the end. But Guzan saved well.

In the first half the American goalkeeper twice denied Gomis, who should have scored from Taylor's cross on six minutes. 

He also had a great chance 16 minutes from time after Monetro's ball but Clark diverted the shot away.

Gomis was not to be denied, leaving Garry Monk delighted. 'He persevered and got his goal in the end. He deserved that.'
