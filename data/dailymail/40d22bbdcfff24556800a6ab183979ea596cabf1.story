India has seen a sharp fall in the numbers of foreign tourists, especially women, since the high-profile rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi, a study has found.

In the three months since that attack, the number of foreigners travelling to India has dropped by 25 per cent, according to the the New Delhi-based Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

The number of women tourists has dropped by 35 per cent, the study released last night said.

The gang rape of the 23-year-old university student on a bus in the heart of the Indian capital shocked a country often inured to such sexual violence.

It brought hundreds of thousands of angry citizens out in the streets to demand more safety for women and harsher laws to deter the perpetrators of such acts.

The study surveyed 1,200 tour operators from across the country who said that 'concerns about the safety of female travelers' had impacted how foreign travelers viewed India.

Since the December gang rape there have been two widely publicised incidents where foreign female travellers have been attacked.

Last month a Swiss woman was gang raped in central India as she and her husband camped in a remote forest.

However, it emerged today that she has asked judges trying her six attackers not to impose the death penalty.

Judges in Daita, central India, 
opened the case on Saturday with four of the six charged with rape and 
the other two facing assault and robbery charges.

The court heard that the 39-year-old 
victim and her husband had been on a cycling holiday in Madhya Pradesh 
state when their camp was attacked by the gang.

After beating and tying up her 30-year-old husband, the gang pinned down and raped his terrified wife, said prosecutors.

The Swiss couple were not in court but are expected to give evidence in person during the two week trial. Judges adjourned the case until later this month.

In the second incident a young 
British woman says she was forced to jump out of the window of her hotel
room to avoid a sexual attack in Agra, the city that is home to the Taj
Mahal.

According to the study, the three incidents have hurt tourism and nearly 72 percent of the tour operators said cancellations of holiday bookings came mostly from women tourists, most of them from Britain, the United States, Canada and Australia.

The study said that travelers planning trips to India had instead opted for other Asian countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam.

The winter months from November to March mark the peak tourist season in India.

According to India's Tourism Ministry, 6.6 million foreign tourists visited India in 2012, earning the country $17.74billion in foreign exchange.
