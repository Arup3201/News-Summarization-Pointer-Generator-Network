Leeds president Massimo Cellino's court trial in Sardinia for tax evasion has been delayed, it has been reported.

Cellino's trial for allegedly failing to pay import duty on a yacht was due to take place on Thursday, but the judge has had to step down due to a conflict of interest. A new trial date has yet to be confirmed.

Judge Dr Sandra Lepore convicted Cellino for failing to pay tax on his yacht Nelie in March and cannot hear the second case involving another yacht, Lucky 23.

Cellino was fined around £400,000 for the earlier conviction and subsequently barred from completing his takeover of Leeds by the Football League under its 'owners and directors' test.

The Italian businessman won an appeal against the League's ruling and completed his takeover at Elland Road in April.

But the appeal judge who overturned that decision ruled that if Judge Lepore confirmed in her written report that the tax evasion in the Nelie case had been a deliberate act of dishonesty then Cellino would fail the League's 'owners and directors' test.

Leeds drew 1-1 at Carrow Road in their Championship clash with Norwich City on Tuesday night 

Judge Lepore has since confirmed there was 'elusive intent' and 'Machiavellian simulation' by Cellino and the League is under mounting pressure to force him to sell the club.

The League has yet to receive a copy of Dr Lepore's report and, it is understood, has no right to request a copy.

Under League rules, Cellino is obligated to notify the governing body of any change in his 'fit and proper' status.
