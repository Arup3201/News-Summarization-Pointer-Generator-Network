Danica said: 'I was treated very badly, a guest started insulting me, saying someone as fat as me should not be in there.

'Then another sauna guest joined in saying people like me were drowned in the middle ages. I did not want to sit back and take the insults and asked them to stop.'

She now faces GBH charges, verbal abuse charges and resisting a request from law enforcers.
