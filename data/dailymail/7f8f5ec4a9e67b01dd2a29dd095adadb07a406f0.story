Holders India will confirm top spot in Group B if they can beat surprise packages Ireland. Follow the score as MS Dhoni's side look to maintain their 100 per cent record in Hamilton. 

William Porterfield's men need to win one from their final two pool games to progress out of their group for the second time in three World Cups.

Already they have beaten two full-member nations, West Indies and Zimbabwe, but a third scalp is likely still required with Pakistan also still to play next Sunday.

India have already qualified for the last-eight and could opt to rest some of their key players at Seddon Park, but Porterfield is not banking on the prospect.

'No, I don't think their guard will ever be down,' he said.

'Whatever they decide to do is out of our control. Whoever they decide to play, it doesn't really bother me.

'We've just got to keep all the momentum going and keep on improving at the little things we want to and keep taking things forward.' 

Ireland's status as a genuine threat to the established nations in world cricket has again been confirmed at this tournament, although it would arguably be their greatest giant-killing should they beat an India side unbeaten at this tournament.
