Gianfranco Zola has been sacked as manager of Italian side Cagliari after fewer than three months in charge.

The former West Ham and Watford boss won just two of his 10 matches at the club and leaves them 18th in the table, four points from safety.

Zdenek Zeman, who Zola replaced in December, has been brought back in as manager.

Cagliari have picked up just one point from their last six games and the 2-0 defeat by Sampdoria was the final straw for the club's hierarchy. 

'Cagliari announce that Gianfranco Zola and his staff have been relieved of the technical leadership of the first team,' the Sardinian club said in a statement.

'It was a decision which was taken reluctantly against a great man who has written unforgettable pages in the history of Cagliari, bringing brilliance and giving international prestige to the land of Sardinia.

'Thanks go to him and his staff for the work done in recent months with dedication, professionalism and passion, and we wish him heartfelt good luck for the rest of his career.'

The 48-year-old became the sixth Serie A managerial casualty of the season.

The others were Eugenio Corini (Chievo), Walter Mazzarri (Inter Milan), Pierpaolo Bisoli (Cesena), Zeman (Cagliari) and Stefano Colantuono (Atalanta).
