The final curtain is falling on the remaining Blockbuster stores that Dish Network Corp. runs in the U.S.

The closures announced Wednesday will affect about 300 Blockbuster locations scattered around the country.

As part of Dish Network's retreat, Blockbuster's DVD-by-mail service is also shutting down next month.

About 2,800 people who work in Blockbuster's stores and DVD distribution centers will lose their jobs, according to Dish Network.

The cost-cutting measures culminate a Blockbuster downfall that began a decade ago with the rise of Netflix's DVD-by-mail service, followed by the introduction of a subscription service that streams video over high-speed Internet connections.

‘This is not an easy decision, yet consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment,’ Dish Network CEO Joseph Clayton said in a statement.

The once-successful Blockbuster video-store giant traces its roots to a single store that opened October 1985 in Dallas, Texas.

The founder of the company, David Cook, used the revenue from the first several stores he had opened to build a massive warehouse and expand his growing empire.

In late 1980s, the company was sold to John Melk and Wayne Huizenga, former executives at Waste Management, who greatly expanded the company, opening one store every 24 hours.

The turning point for Blockbuster came in 1997, when Silicon Valley executive Reed Hastings launched Netflix, which went public five years later.

After several years of corporate infighting and declining sales, Blockbuster hit a low point in 2010 when it filed for bankruptcy protection.

The shift has been a boon for Netflix Inc., which now boasts 31 million subscribers to its Internet video service and another 7.1million DVD-by-mail customers.

The company's success has minted Netflix with a market value of $20billion.

But Blockbuster absorbed huge losses. It closed thousands of its stores before landing in bankruptcy court three years ago.

Dish Network bought Blockbuster's remnants for about $234million in 2011 and then tried to mount a challenge to Netflix.

But Dish Network couldn't wring a profit from Blockbuster either, prompting even more store closures.

Last year, the parent company shuttered 500 Blockbuster stores - about a third of its remaining brick-and-mortar retail centers.

The Englewood, Colo., satellite-TV provider had already closed about 500 Blockbuster stores this year.

The latest closures, scheduled to be completed by early January, will leave the U.S. with just 50 Blockbuster stores operating under franchise agreements.

The chain's near extinction serves as another stark reminder of how quickly technology can reshape industries. Just a decade ago, Blockbuster reigned as one of the country's most ubiquitous retailers with 9,100 stores in the U.S.

Dish Network is trying to keep the Blockbuster brand alive through an Internet video-streaming service that rents movies and TV shows by title, for a set viewing time.

Blockbuster suffered an operating loss of $35million on revenue of $1.1billion last year and posted an operating loss of $4million during the first half of this year, according to regulatory filings.
