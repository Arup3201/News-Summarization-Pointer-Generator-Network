ABC News host Elizabeth Vargas is being helped through her recovery from alcohol addiction and impending divorce from her husband of 12 years by a former colleague.

Vargas, who returned to working on 20/20 two months ago after entering rehab for a second time in August, is reported to be seeing former ABC News executive vice president Dave Davis as she continues her fight to maintain sobriety and finalizes her split from songwriter Marc Cohn.

Davis is now general manager at local New York news station WABC-TV and he and Vargas, 52, have been seen out in the city together.

A source told the New York Post that Davis is a ‘treasured friend’ who has known Vargas for a long time because they both work at ABC News.

‘Elizabeth has been going through a difficult time in her life, and they are not dating. She is focused on her sobriety and recovery and is not ready for a new relationship,’ said the source.

Vargas has been very open about her ongoing struggle with alcoholism.

In August, the married mother of two checked into a rehabilitation center in California, where she stayed for a week, followed by outpatient treatment. She also had sought treatment for alcohol addiction last November. 

The veteran 20/20 anchor is also in the process of divorcing her husband of 12 years, songwriter Marc Cohn. The couple have two sons, 10-year-old Zachary and Samuel, aged seven.

Cohn's spokeswoman told MailOnline in October that 'The split took place last winter, and it is amicable. Both parties are devoted parents and are committed to putting the boys first.'

The Post reports that the ex-couple are going through divorce mediation, but papers have not yet been signed.

Cohn - who is best known for his Grammy-winning song Walking In Memphis - has remained supportive of Vargas despite their split and rumors that he cheated with a mutual friend, which he denied.

After his wife entered rehab, Cohn released a statement.

'On behalf of Elizabeth's family,' the 55-year-old wrote, 'we are in total support of her recovery and want her to be well.' 

In November 2013, Elizabeth announced she had battled her addiction for a decade, and admitted it had taken her years to admit she is an alcoholic.

Cohn
 was the only one who knew about Vargas' struggles with alcohol for many year and when he
 finally confronted her, the ABC anchor recalled feeling 'really angry' 
while acknowledging that he was right.

Vargas took to Twitter in October to let her fans know that she was returning to the anchor's chair on 20/20

When
 asked about the cause of her addiction, Vargas revealed that she has
 been suffering from severe anxiety since she was a little girl and dealt with the stress by drinking.

Her father served in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and she recalled that when her mother would leave the house to go to work, she suffered daily panic attacks that carried into adulthood.

Vargas said it took her a long time to seek treatment because she didn't want to feel like a failure and was still able to function in her daily life.

She recalled that her ‘aha' moment came one day when she arrived at work to film a 20/20 segment and realized that she was too drunk to do it. 

Vargas is a well-respected television journalist who got her start at 
Chicago's WBBM before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for Dateline.

She was named co-anchor alongside David Muir of ABC's investigative news program 20/20 in 2004.

The New Jersey native won an Emmy in 1999 for her coverage of the Elian Gonzalez immigration case. 

Earlier this year she signed a new contract with ABC.

A spokesperson for the network said: 'We're behind Elizabeth 100 per cent, she's taking the time to do the work she needs to do.' 

In October she announced via Twitter that she was returning to the anchor's chair on 20/20 after completing a treatment program for alcohol addiction.

'So many thx to everyone for your support! It means so much. I am back to work next week, so happy to come back!' Vargas wrote.

Elizabeth Vargas appeared on 'Good Morning America' in January to publicly discuss for the first time her addiction to alcohol, which she had been keeping a secret for many years.

'I am an alcoholic,' Vargas told George Stephanopoulos. 'It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time to admit it to my family, but I am.'

‘You become so isolated with the secret and so lonely, because you can’t tell anyone what’s happening,’ she explained.

‘I started thinking “Well, you know, I’ll only drink, you know, on weekends,” she said with a laugh. ‘I’ll only drink, you know, two glasses of wine a night. I won’t drink on nights before I have to get up and do “Good Morning America.” But those deals never work.’

Vargas used wine to treat her anxiety and deal with the stresses of her work.

‘That’s exhausting, to live like that. And it becomes very easy to think “I deserve this glass of wine. I’m so stressed out …,”’ she said.

When Vargas finally decided to enter rehab, she and her husband told their sons that she was suffering from an alcohol allergy.

‘I didn’t want to use the word “disease” with them, even though that’s how it’s classified by the medical profession,’ she said. ‘It’s too scary, you know, the connotation for them is disease is something deadly.’

Vargas admitted that even now it is hard for her not to drink, but she has been relying on prayers, meditation and a great support system to conquer her urges triggered by stress.

‘There are lots of people who feel a lot of stress,’ she said. ‘Not everybody turns to a glass of wine or three like I did, or four, like I did on some occasions. What I learned to do when I was away was to feel the feelings.’

She concluded: 'Alcohol for me is no longer an option.'
