Queens Park Rangers are facing a record-breaking fine - even if they are promoted this season - after recording a huge £65.4million loss, taking their overall net debt to £177m.

The Championship club have posted their financial report for the year ending May 2013, and the document underlines the heavy spending of co-owner Tony Fernandes' reign.

But as a result of their failures on the pitch, QPR are now facing major ramifications under Financial Fair Play regulations, even if they are promoted back in to the Barclays Premier League this season.

Under Football League Financial Fair Play regulations, the west London club could be forced to pay in-excess of £40million for breaching the rules even if they are promoted this summer.

The club have recorded a net debt of £177million - a massive increase from £91.4m the previous year.

Turnover dropped from £64m to £60.6m, but wage costs sky-rocketed from £58.5m to £78m.

The news casts a huge cloud over the club's future and, in the report, Fernandes wrote: 'Clearly in 2012-13 the club did not meet its performance targets and was relegated from the Premier League.

'A critical driver of any club’s value is its presence in the Premier League, and the club is focused on regaining its Premier League status as quickly as possible.

'The financial results reflect the club’s focus on trying to achieve on-pitch success.

'When, alongside my business partners, I purchased a majority shareholding in the club in August 2011, my goal was to turn QPR into an established Premier League club.

'Being relegated was obviously not part of our plans, but our focus and determination to achieve our long-term goals has not diminished.

'During the summer 2013 transfer window we have worked to put together a squad of players we believe will give us a good chance of achieving promotion back to the Premier League.

'At the time of writing, we have made a good start to the 2013-14 season and we remain confident that under the guidance of our manager, Harry Redknapp, we have a squad capable of challenging for promotion.

'We are confident that the 2013-14 season will also see the club continue to make progress towards achieving its short, medium and long-term off-pitch targets.

'The group’s key short-term objective is to regain its Premier League status. The board believes that some restructuring of the playing squad is required in order to achieve this. However, they are conscious of the need for expenditure to be closely monitored and controlled.

'The directors, based on cash flow projections prepared by management and through confirmation of continuing support from the groups’ main shareholders and creditors, have a reasonable expectation that the company and the group have adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future.'
