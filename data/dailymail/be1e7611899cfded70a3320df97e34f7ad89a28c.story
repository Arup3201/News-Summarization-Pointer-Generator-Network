Conor McGregor is gearing up for a featherweight title challenge against Jose Aldo on July 11 and has unveiled a fearsome new tattoo ahead of the encounter.

The 26-year-old Irishman has already got a picture of a gorilla eating a heart inked upon his chest and 'The Notorious' has now revealed a tiger's face tattooed onto his stomach.

'If you see the tiger, it's too late. You're food,' McGregor wrote next to the Instagram post of his new artwork.

McGregor is challenging Jose Aldo for his featherweight champion title in Las Vegas on July 11

Aldo makes  the eighth defence of his belt against the Irish fighter in Las Vegas, but McGregor claimed last week that the man he is challenging lacks the same motivation as him.

'He doesn't want to be near me, he doesn't want this the way I want it,' McGregor said. 

'He can't hide the fact he doesn't want the belt in his presence.'

At the end of March, the duo were undergoing a promotional tour in Dublin when McGregor grabbed the belt from Aldo and raised it in front of 5,000 home supporters.

The pair have a fractious relationship as it is, with a little under three months away until McGregor has a chance to legitimately hold the belt before his supporters.
