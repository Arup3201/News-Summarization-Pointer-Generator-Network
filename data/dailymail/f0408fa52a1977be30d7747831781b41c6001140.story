Producers of artificial lawns are seeing a boost in sales in California as the state is experiencing its driest year on record.

Fake grass has emerged as a way of achieving a constantly green front yard while saving water, as some counties in the state have banned watering of lawns altogether.

Californians have been asked to reduce water use by 20 per cent and Governor Jerry Brown is urging people to not flush toilets 'more than you have to.’

A snow survey Thursday in the Sierra Nevada in Northern California found the snow water equivalent was just 12 per cent of normal for this time of winter.

The water in the northern and central Sierra snowpack provides about a third of California's water supply, leaving state officials worried for the water supply in the coming weeks.

A weak cold weather system provided a few sprinkles of rain yesterday, but it amounted to only a few hundreds of an inch and ‘the chances of tipping any rain buckets is much closer to zero,’ a National Weather Service forecast said.

The chance of rain was to continue over the weekend, however ‘even the wettest models suggest a very light precipitation at best, mostly under a tenth of an inch,’ the forecast said.

‘Make no mistake, this drought is a big wakeup call,’ Governor Brown said yesterday before meeting with local water district officials in downtown Los Angeles, where a smattering of rain fell later in the day.

‘Hopefully it's going to rain. If it doesn't, we're going to have to act in a very strenuous way in every part of the state to get through.’

‘Every day this drought goes on, we're going to have to tighten the screws on what people are doing,’ Brown said.

Brown declared a state drought emergency earlier this month and called on Californians to reduce their water usage by 20 per cent.

On Thursday he offered some practical advice, including avoiding long solo showers and cutting down on toilet flushing.

State climatologist Michael Anderson said only 1.53 inches of rain were recorded from October through December, the lowest aggregate total in records dating back to 1895.

Officials say 2013 was also state's driest calendar year since records started being kept.

Southern California has been stockpiling water to deal with potential shortages but some places in the state are struggling.

State officials have said that 17 rural communities are in danger of a severe water shortage within four months. Wells are running dry or reservoirs are nearly empty in some communities. Others have long-running problems that predate the drought.

The communities range from the area covered by the tiny Lompico County Water District in Santa Cruz County to the cities of Healdsburg and Cloverdale in Sonoma County.
