Patricia Murphy drank 350 units of alcohol every week for ten years

It is a miracle that Patricia Murphy is alive.

Nine months ago the 45-year-old was admitted to hospital suffering with cirrhosis of the liver as a result of drinking 350 units of alcohol every week for ten years.

Patricia ended up on a life support machine, and her skin turned a grisly yellow colour due to her massive organ failure. She was given a 5% chance of survival and a priest was called to read her last rites. But she survived, and a picture taken of her at her lowest became the trigger for a turning point in her life.

She is now sober, and feeling lucky to still be 
alive the former sales assistant appeared on This Morning today to tell her 
story and warn other women about the dangers of alcohol, the legal 
substance which ruined her life.

She said: 'That picture was the turning point. Seeing how yellow I was. I went through a lot, I couldn't even walk when I came off intensive care, but now it's as if the illness has been lifted from my brain.'

Patricia began drinking when she was 17, after leaving school to train as a sales assistant.

Naturally
shy, drinking made her feel confident among her peers, and soon she was
drinking 10 double brandy and Cokes at the weekends.

She said: I was always the first one in and the last person out of the pub. If someone offered me a drink and I already had one I would always take it. I always ordered doubles.

'When I was 28 I stopped going out because I couldn't get as drunk as I wanted to. It's not normal to drink like that. It's a slippery road. I was born with the addiction. I was always going to be an alcoholic.'

It was at the age of 28 that Patricia also lost both her mother and father, which sent her drinking to new, more dangerous depths. She swapped Bacardi and brandy for wine because it was easier to get drunk and made her less aggressive.

She said: 'Being drunk means that you don't have to feel things, you can get oblivious.

'I have been in to rehab three times but each time I came out I would go and buy wine and drink. I didn't want to stop it, I wanted to get drunk. I liked the way it made me feel.'

The 45-year-old from Chessington appeared on This Morning today to warn other women of the dangers

Soon she was drinking five bottles of 
wine every day, and waking up in the middle of the night sweating and 
shaking. She lost her job because she was unable to hold down any kind of routine and then used all of her benefits money to buy alcohol, and spent 
all day watching TV and feeling depressed.

Despite attending Alcoholics Anonymous 
meetings and her visits to rehab it was a visit to her local GP which saved Patricia's life. She was told that her liver was seriously damaged and immediately taken to hospital with 
cirrhosis where she collapsed and remebers little of the next few weeks of her life.

After a 10-week stay, when the picture of her turning yellow was taken, Patricia was released. Despite her ordeal, 
the first thing she did upon release was buy wine. Luckily, she was 
disgusted with herself for doing it, and has been sober ever since.

This picture of Patricia was taken while she was in hospital suffering from massive organ failure

'At
the moment, doctors are happy with my progress, but my life expectancy 
will be affected. My liver is so scarred, it will slowly stop 
functioning,' she told Closer magazine.

A scan in October will determine whether or not Patricia needs a liver transplant.

Today she said:  'Life is brilliant, I am happy. I wasn't living before, just sleeping and drinking, sleeping and drinking. The drink takes over so very quickly.

'My advice to other women in a similar situation is to go to your GP, but you have to accept your situation and you have to want to stop.'

Patricia told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford she feels as though the disease has been lifted from her brain after seeing the picture and surviving her hospital scare
