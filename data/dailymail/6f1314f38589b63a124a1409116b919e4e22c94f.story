Disbarred lawyer, Ann Marie Miller, 40, will be extradited to Colorado to face charges that she swindled two elderly men out of their homes

A former lawyer who removed her fingerprints to hide her identity will be extradited to Colorado to faces charges that she swindled two elderly men out of their homes.

Ann Marie Miller, 40, has been charged with 14 counts of theft, forgery, conspiracy and attempting to influence a public servant.

The disbarred bankruptcy lawyer, who burned off her fingerprints with chemicals, will go on trial next month in Allen County, Ohio, on a felony tampering charge.

Lynn Kimbrough, spokesman for the Denver District Attorney's Office, said prosecutors will file extradition papers to move her to Colorado after she is tried in Ohio.

Miller came to the attention of police when the siblings of an elderly man who suffered from dementia tried to sell their brother's home after his death.

They found he no longer owned the property, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.

Prosecutors accuse Miller of filing a fraudulent claim to the house days before the man died, transferring ownership to her alleged accomplice, a paroled sex offender.

Investigators were made aware of a second victim, an elderly man whose will was allegedly forged by Miller, revoking his previous will and deeding his house to her.

Miller was arrested after trying to use a fake birth certificate to obtain a state identification card under the name Julia Wadsworth.

While booking her in jail, authorities discovered that her fingerprints were gone.

'There was no ridge detail whatsoever. Just smooth, like a baby's butt. They're never going to come back,' said Allen County Sheriff Samuel Crish.

On her computer, investigators found she had researched information on how to remove fingerprints and how to determine if someone was being investigated by a federal agency.

She was identified after Sheriff Crish's office contacted police in southwest Florida, where the woman mentioned she had spent time caring for an elderly man.

Miller practised law in Roanoke until her license was revoked in 2009 by the Virginia Bar, records show. 

The former lawyer previously faced several charges in Virginia relating to a love triangle with a male attorney and a female paralegal.
