Tributes have been paid to popular BBC presenter Komla Dumor who died suddenly at his home in London.

The broadcaster said Mr Dumor, who presented BBC World News and Focus On Africa, had died at his home yesterday, at the age of 41.

One of Ghana's best known journalists, Mr Dumor joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of working in broadcast journalism in his native Ghana, where he had won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award.

Respected: Journalist Komla Dumor, who presented BBC World News and Focus On Africa, had died at his London home yesterday, at the age of 41

Mr Dumor, who was born in Accra, Ghana, in 1972 hosted Network Africa for the BBC World Service between 2007 and 2009 before joining The World Today programme.

In 2009 he became the first host of Africa Business Report on BBC World News. Earlier this year he was named one of New African's 100 most influential Africans in 2013.

'Komla's many friends and colleagues across Africa and the world will be as devastated as we are by this shocking news,' said Director of BBC Global News, Peter Horrocks.

'Komla was a leading light of African journalism - committed to telling the story of Africa as it really is. Africa's energy and enthusiasm seemed to shine through every story Komla told. He will be deeply missed.

'The sympathies of all his colleagues at the BBC are with his family and friends.'

BBC Director of News, James Harding, said: 'It is hard to believe that Komla is no longer with us because, in every way, he was larger than life.

'He had such an infectious enthusiasm for life, for Africa, for the story. He was an inspiring journalist, both on screen and off it.

'He played a singular role in transforming the coverage of Africa, not only for the BBC but across broadcasting. And he brought a depth of understanding, a great deal of courage, a joyous charm and boundless charisma to his work.

'He was adored by the people who worked with him and we will miss him deeply. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.'

BBC Radio 4 Today presenter 
Mishal Husain also paid tribute to Mr Dumor, taking to twitter to describe him as'one of our brightest and best'.

'Our BBC family tonight mourns loss of one of our brightest & best -
 Komla Dumor. Big heart, big personality, brilliant broadcaster,' she 
wrote.

'Komla developed his own unique on air style, seamlessly moved 
between TV and radio & influenced Africa coverage across the BBC.'

It has been reported that Mr Dumor suffered a heart attack.

During his wide-reaching career, Mr DumorÂ  interviewed a number of high-profile guests including Kofi Annan and Bill Gates, while last month he covered the funeral of former South African President, Nelson Mandela.

In his review of 2013, Mr Dumor said the passing of Mandela was 'one of the moments that will stay with me,' according to the BBC.

'Covering the funeral for me will always be a special moment. I will look back on it with a sense of sadness. But also with gratitude. I feel lucky to have been a witness to that part of the Mandela story.'
