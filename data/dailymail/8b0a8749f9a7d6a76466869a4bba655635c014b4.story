A military mother and veteran is facing heartbreak after being told that her daughter died four days after she arrived back home in Virginia following two-years in Afghanistan.

Tammy Wilson discovered her daughter Amber Schei had died in a hit-and-run on Saturday in San Diego and instead of her tearful reunion with her 'beautiful angel', Wilson will now have to plan her 27-year-old girl's funeral.

Having struggled to hold down a steady job recently, Schei was also in a recovery home and hoping to be brought back together with her 10-year-old daughter.

'She was in a -- I wouldn't call it a half-way house -- but one of those homes that they have for... she was diagnosed with a disorder where she had assistance, where they gave her meds and assistance through the state,' said Wilson to NBC News.

Wilson added that her daughter seemed fine during their last conversation and she was even trying to get her girl to return to school.

Wilson is planning on burying her daughter in Virginia after first holding services in California and Panama City Beach 'where Amber was truly at peace and enjoyed life, living with me and her brother, Christopher, before he went to the Navy,' Wilson said.

Shei's body was found early on Saturday morning in a wooded side road off the Nimitz Boulevard.

San Diego Police Sgt. Art Doherty said her injuries were consistent with being struck by a vehicle, so they believe she was fatally wounded by a hit-and-run driver.

Doherty said if it was a hit-and-run, the suspectâ€™s vehicle likely has significant damage to its front.
