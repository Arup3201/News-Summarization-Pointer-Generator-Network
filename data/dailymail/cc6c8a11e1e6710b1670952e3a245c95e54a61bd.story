I doubt that Tomas Berdych will be saying anything to Andy Murray again on court in a hurry.

His brief few words as they changed over at the end of the first set created the perfect double whammy — it did him as much harm as it did Murray good.

I am aware that I said prior to the match that Andy should not let this get personal, but the fact is the timing of Berdych’s remark was so perfect for Murray — and disastrous from the Czech’s point of view — that it swung the match around. Both players had invested so much in the first set, which was over an hour-and-a-quarter of really hard tennis, that it was massive for Tomas to win it.

You can be sure that he will have been pumped and his opponent deflated, especially as Andy knew he had chances to take it.

I was surprised that Berdych initiated it because confrontation is not really in his character and his level completely dropped afterwards.

He virtually donated the next two games and lost 16 out of the next 20 points.

As for Andy, the incident just helped him forget those 76 long minutes after which he had ended up with nothing.

Instead of being down on himself he got fired up all over again and started playing more positively, especially on his forehand side.

He rode this momentum all the way through the next two sets and, as I predicted beforehand, ended up winning in four.

It was not a big altercation but the key thing was that it suited Andy’s personality while it did not suit Tomas at all.

Murray had actually been as emotional for a first set as I recall, so he was up for this from the start. He could have faded after that lost tiebreak but his opponent unwittingly ensured that it did not happen.
