Three hospitals just outside Cincinnati received an influx of ten suspected heroin overdose victims in just 48 hours last week.

Facilities in Fort Thomas, Florence and Covington treated the men and women aged 23 to 50 all with the lifesaving drug Narcan.

Two victims, men aged 26 and 31, died from their overdoses, which officials say could have actually been caused by the opiate fentanyl--not heroin.

A quick response and a dose of naloxone, an opiate-reversing drug, bring most patients back. Some are put on ventilators. A few never revive. 

Overdose: Three hospitals just outside Cincinnati received an influx of ten suspected heroin overdose victims in just 48 hours last week. Two of the ODs resulted in death, both were men and both occurred at St. Elizabeth Healthcare in Ft. Thomas, Kentucky

Fentanyl and heroin seizures are on the rise in the area. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with a powder to make it look more like heroin.

Fentanyl, an even more potent opiate, is especially dangerous when users believe it to be heroin.

It was unclear as of Thursday which drug was to blame for the overdoses, according to Ashel Kruetzkamp, nurse manager at St. Elizabeth Fort Thomas, where both fatalities occurred.

'Our staff is getting alarmed about the rates of these overdoses that we're seeing,' Kruetzkamp told Cincinnati.com.

In 2007, there were an estimated 373,000 heroin users in the U.S. By 2012, the number was 669,000, with the greatest increases among those 18 to 25. First-time users nearly doubled in a six-year period ending in 2012, from 90,000 to 156,000.

Experts note that many users turned to heroin after a crackdown on prescription drug 'pill mills' made painkillers such as OxyContin harder to find and more costly. It's killing because it can be extremely pure or laced with other powerful narcotics. That, coupled with a low tolerance once people start using again after treatment, is catching addicts off guard.

In hard-hit places, police, doctors, parents and former users are struggling to find solutions and save lives.

The problem is especially severe in Ohio and southern Ohio more specifically.

Heroin-related deaths have more than tripled in Butler County, just north of the city.

There were 55 deaths last year, and within one two-week period, the city's emergency paramedic units responded to 18 heroin overdoses. 

Growing problem: Heroin is taking more and more lives across America and Ohio--specifically southern Ohio along with northern Kentucky--is espcially bad off
