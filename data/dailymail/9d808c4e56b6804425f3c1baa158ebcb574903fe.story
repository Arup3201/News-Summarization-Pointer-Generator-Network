Some Easter Egg hunts will be indoors this year as bad weather is forecast for over the holiday weekend. 

Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane will be the wettest capital cities this Easter weekend. But it didn't back up the old wives' tale that it always rains at Easter either, as the Meteorology Department said most other regions will remain dry for the most part. 

The department said it's normal for eastern New South Wales and south-east Queensland to get more rain in Autumn with heavy showers forecast for Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Is there anybody out there? Thick fog descends on Sydney Harbour Bridge on Wednesday morning

I think the car's flooded: Huge amounts of rain fell in south-east Queensland, with this man left stranded in Nundah, Brisbane

Sydneysiders got their working day off to a strange start on Wednesday as thick fog descended on the city. 

At one stage in the early morning it had totally obscured the Sydney Harbour Bridge. But it cleared as the day progressed. 

However, it was the threat of rain, not fog that was the big issue 

'It's due to an up-level trough that's moving across the area. Rainfall will be widespread in these regions,' a spokesman for the Meteorology Department said. 

'As well as these areas the rainfall will possibly spread into the far east of Victoria.' 

The fog surrounding Sydney Harbour Bridge is just for starters as rain is forecast for the city over the Easter weekend

Severe storms were already causing big problems though. Huge amounts of rain fell in south-east Queensland, with many locals waking up to flooded yards and roads.

ABC News reports that six children had a lucky escape and just had cuts and bruises after a tree collapsed at Logan's Park Ridge State High School about 8:30am.

Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFRS) had also been called to several swift water rescues, including two at the Brisbane suburb of Zillmere.  

Stones Corner in Brisbane was another area that was badly hit by torrential rain on Wednesday

The Sunshine Coast was still being battered and the Meteorology Department warned the storms were likely to produce prolonged heavy rain and flash flooding.

Over the Easter weekend rain is also forecast for central parts of Western Australia to the north of Perth, although Perth itself will be mostly fine. 

Across the Northern Territory it will be relatively stable with isolated showers and storms, but nothing out of the ordinary for this time of year.

Apart from the far eastern part of Victoria, Melbourne will be mostly dry over the holiday period. 

In the Brisbane suburb of Virginia more cars were left swamped in rain water after the storm hit

Bad weather maybe forecast in Sydney, but Melbourne will be mostly dry over the holiday period   

'Melbourne will be possibly cloudy with a few showers, but over all it see the same rainfall as the eastern part of the country,' the spokesman said.

Canberra will have its worst weather on Friday and Saturday, while Brisbane could be in for showers on each of the four days due to brisk southeasterly winds.

Hobart and Adelaide all have less than a 30% chance of getting any showers on any across the weekend.
