David Beckham has backed Steven Gerrard to prolong his international career beyond this summer despite England's unsuccessful World Cup campaign under his leadership.

Gerrard is yet to make an announcement on his international future as the 34-year-old wanted time to reflect on England's disastrous tournament in Brazil before making a decision.

Undecided: England captain Gerrard is yet to make a decision on his international future

Beckham believes Gerrard still has a significant role to play in the Three Lions set-up as young English starlets such as Ross Barkley, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw can learn from the experienced Liverpool captain.

'I think it would be great if Steven continues because it was a disappointing tournament for the whole team and the captain kind of takes the real kind of brunt of things,' said Beckham.

'But as a captain you feel a certain responsibility to lift the team. Stevie has done that for many years for Liverpool and for England. He has always been a real motivator, the way he plays and his passion that he shows on the pitch.

'I would love to see Stevie continue because I think these young players need someone to look up to and a mentor - someone that has been there and done it - and I think that Steve is a great captain.

'He doesn't need my advice but one thing that I would say; that if you can play for England as long as you can, then do it.'
