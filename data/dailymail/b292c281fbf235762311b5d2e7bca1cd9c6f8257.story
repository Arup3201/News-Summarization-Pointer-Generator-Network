Martha Stewart is recovering from the loss of her CEO to rival Gwyneth Paltrow by axing up to 50 employees.

The cuts will hit the sales and marketing departments at Martha Stewart Omnimedia hardest while some workers will be moved to Meredith Corporation. 

Last week, the 73-year-old's former CEO Lisa Gersh was hired by Paltrow's lifestyle company GOOP, which is currently engaged in a vicious media war with Martha's brand.

But staffers were shocked to find out the news because the layoffs had been such a well-kept secret, a source told the New York Daily News. 

It's not the first time Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia has shaken things up in a significant way.

Last year, nearly 100 people were handed pink slips just before the holiday season, and in 2012 the company let 70 workers go in November. 

'They want (laid-off workers) to keep coming in through October 31, then they get (paid for) 60 days after that, but I can't see anyone going in,' said the source.  

'I can't imagine Meredith will have a use for all those people.  I think those people have to know the writing is on the wall.

'It was a big deal. There were people crying.' 

Stewart's comeback was in the form of a recipe for a pie called 'Conscious Coupling,' a clear dig at Paltrow's split from Chris Martin

Last year, Martha sparked the feud with Gwyneth by questioning GOOP entering the competitive arena of celebrity lifestyle brands which she thought she had reigned over for so many years. 

And last month, Martha mocked Paltrow saying she 'just needs to be quiet'.

'She's a movie star. If she were confident in her acting, she wouldn't be trying to be Martha Stewart.' 

But Gwyneth soon responded: 'I'll try to recover.

'If I'm really honest, I'm so psyched that she sees us as competition. I'm so psyched. I really am.' 

The feud continued in the latest issue of Martha Stewart Living, where she mocked the Iron Man star by making a reference to Gwyneth's well-known 'conscious uncoupling' quip - a clear dig at her separation from husband Chris Martin in March.

In the November issue, Martha titled one of the pages 'Conscious Coupling' to describe the 'perfect marriages of crust and filling' when it comes to making a pie.
