The mother of six who faked her own battle with cancer to get money from sympathetic strangers has spoken out, revealing that she genuinely believed she was sick.

The family and friends of Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds, 31, have been left devastated by her deception after it was revealed she never had stage six ovarian cancer like she claimed.

In an interview with Woman's Day Ms Edmunds, from Lake Macquarie in New South Wales, said she believed her mind had tricked her into thinking she had the terminal illness – and she even underwent chemotherapy using pills she bought on the internet.

Elizabeth 'Elle' Edmunds, 31, had reported that she was diagnosed with stage six ovarian cancer in April, and had been told she had only three years left to live

'I really thought I was dying… I honestly thought my kids were going to grow up without me,' she told the magazine.

In April, Ms Edmunds sat her family down and told them she had cancer and doctors had given her just three years to live.

The mother-of-six from Lake Macquarie, NSW, went to great lengths to convince friends, family, and strangers that she had cancer, shaving her head and faking hospital visits for chemotherapy treatments

She went to great lengths to keep up the charade, faking hospital visits and shaving her head.

But now she is unable to explain how she spent the time her family believed she was using to go to appointments and receive treatment.

Strangers set up a Facebook page and online crowd-funding account to raise money for her – but last month Ms Edmunds' partner John Heaghney found out the truth and posted a status to let everyone know.

Ms Edmunds said she was sorry for her deception, which has totally destroyed her relationships with her partner and children.

The 31-year-old said she thought the loss of a newborn baby seven years ago may have led her to suffer a breakdown, which led her to make up the cancer.

'I don't know how my mind has done this to me,' she told Woman's Day.

The Lake Macquarie woman added that she would pay back the money that was raised for her, even though she had spent it on medication and doctors' appointments.

Sydney mother Jessica McKay, who took pity when she heard Ms Edmunds' story and set up a Help For Elle Facebook page to raise money, says she feels devastated by the whole ordeal.

'I had so many people willing to support and help out and she never had cancer',' Ms McKay wrote on the social networking site. 

'I felt betrayed and so upset that I had gone to all this hard work of trying to raise donations for this low life piece of s*** who faked cancer and scammed not just me but my friends, family and community that helped out.'

Crowdfunding pages and Facebook charity groups were set up in support for Ms Edmunds, raising significant funds through charity functions and online auctions for her ongoing medical bills

Ms McKay and Roberta Williams, the ex-wife of Victorian gangland identity Carl Williams, organised a $150-a-head fundraiser for Ms Edmunds, but it never went ahead because she suddenly felt 'too sick' to attend.

She said she would donate the money raised to children's charities. 

Members of the Facebook group who had contributed financially or had been raising awareness for Ms Edmunds labeled her actions 'disgusting', and called for jail time.

One member posted that she hoped Ms Edmunds 'got what she deserved', and labeled her a 'disgrace to humanity, filthy lying cheating human, some will forgive you, many will not, and for someone thats lost loved ones to cancer, I feel no sadness any further for what karma comes your way [sic]'.

'The only truth you have admitted to is being very sick mentally, You are sick mentally, sick, sad and twisted and I feel devastated for your loved ones, let alone mine that were sucked into your evil bull***t.'
