Mark Halsey, the controversial former elite referee who lost his role as a regular BT Sport pundit following Premier League upset, has had an invitation to speak to a regional referees association withdrawn following intervention from the highest level.

Halsey was due to address the Sheffield Referee Association on how he beat cancer to continue as a top referee. But an objection from an unnamed football figure led to the national Referees Association persuading their Sheffield branch to embarrassingly cancel the appearance of Halsey, who was giving his services free.

The email from Laura Ritchie, chairwoman of the RA, read: ‘A senior member of the footballing world has brought it to our attention that you have invited Mark Halsey to be a guest speaker. It is a worry that a figure who is being very negative about top-flight referees won’t send the right message to members. It may be perceived Sheffield RA agree with his viewpoint.’

However his planned appearance was cancelled after an unnamed football figure objected against the talk

Sheffield management then informed members: ‘There was an agreement that we cancel Mark after pressure from the national RA and the wider football world.’ And the Sheffield response to the RA said: ‘Our irritation at having been placed in this position cannot be underestimated. Are we saying that as referees, we are above criticism?’

FA refs chief David Elleray is president of the RA but on Monday night HE denied any involvement. However, Halsey’s strong views on a decline in refereeing standards is certainly born out by the widespread furore around their performances this season.

BBC rugby co-commentator Brian Moore reacted to his perceived ‘snub’ at being one of the few TV pundits not included in ITV’s giant World Cup team by tweeting ‘I’ve been told I’m too controversial for TV World Cup coverage. Too c***, I could take but controversial, b*******.’ However, it wasn’t ITV who told Moore he is controversial. The network, happy to employ the more volatile Roy Keane as a football pundit, have had no contact with Moore.

Van Praag bid blunder

FIFA presidential candidate Michael van Praag says, if elected, he intends to cut costs — something he’s never heard mentioned during six years of dealings with Zurich, where figures are just plucked out of the air, he claimed. Van Praag will also declare what his FIFA salary would be and wants to know what Sepp Blatter has been paid.

The Dutch football leader, who has a budget of €400,000 from his national association for his campaign, is also concerned at the way Fox TV were given the rights to the World Cup in 2026 without a tender to end their resistance to a World Cup in Qatar. Yet all Van Praag’s good intentions are undone by his open offer to Blatter, who he says could carry on as a working honorary president concentrating on the Goal Project funding.

Meanwhile, Portuguese contender Luis Figo is rich enough to fund his own campaign but this most charismatic of footballers couldn’t be more dull when he talks FIFA politics.

Blatter is said to be so confident of winning a fifth term that he feels no need to mount any form of campaign and is addressing the UEFA Congress on Tuesday in his FIFA president’s slot rather than as a candidate. However, the 79-year-old is understood to have engaged well-known Swiss PR figure Klaus Stohlker to advise him on his election strategy. Stohlker, former TV journalist and political author, founded his own PR and consulting business in 1982 and is a long-time friend of Blatter’s.

For all the shenanigans, scandals and infighting at the FA over the years, at least there’s never been such an unseemly episode as Germany’s FIFA executive member Theo Zwanziger reporting his successor as German federation president Wolfgang Niersbach to FIFA’s ethics committee over alleged pay and pension irregularities. 

It is a blatant attempt by Zwanziger to stop Niersbach taking his executive seat. FIFA have cleared Niersbach and UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino said Zwanziger’s claims had been fully rejected, adding: ‘It’s all a bit embarrassing for him and sad for German football.’ Niersbach said: ‘I have not heard of a similar story anywhere in football.’
