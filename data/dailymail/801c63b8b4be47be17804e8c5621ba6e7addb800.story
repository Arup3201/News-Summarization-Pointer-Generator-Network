The new rating system is part of a 'transparency drive' by Jeremy Hunt to raise NHS standards

GPs are to be publicly rated on how well they care for their elderly patients – with red ‘traffic light’ warnings for those who fall behind.

Ministers want to publish information on the internet about how good or bad doctors are at keeping the over-60s out of hospital.

Surgeries where too many are admitted to hospital as emergencies will be rated as ‘red’ on the NHS Choices website. Those where the number is in line with expectations, or better, will be rated green.

Ministers hope the move will raise standards among England’s GPs, take pressure off A&E departments, and save the NHS millions by cutting needless hospital stays.

The move is the latest in a ‘transparency drive’ spearheaded by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who thinks standards among England’s 36,000 GPs are far too variable.

Two weeks ago The Mail on Sunday revealed how he was planning to rate GPs on how well they spotted early signs of cancer. 

Government sources say that the size, age profile and social make-up of each surgery’s patient list will be taken into account to avoid unfairly labelling individual doctors. 

Last night charities and patient groups welcomed the initiative, but the Royal College of GPs called it another ‘blunt instrument’.

Caroline Davies of Age UK said: ‘Any measure that encourages better planning of care, gives people confidence in their GP practice and reduces avoidable hospital admissions is welcome.’ 

She added that some GPs needed ‘additional training’ to help elderly patients stay fit, healthy and independent.

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said greater transparency could bring benefits if done in a ‘meaningful’ way.

But she said: ‘Any approach that involves the naming and shaming of individual GPs and practices or that uses blunt instruments such as “traffic lights” to measure the care we provide to our patients would be counter-productive and extremely damaging to the unique relationship that GPs have with their patients.

Surgeries where too many elderly patients are referred to hospital will show up as having a red warning on the NHS Choices website, while those where the number is in line or under expectations will show up as green

‘While initiatives like this might seem beneficial at face value, the data that would be used to inform such ratings would be very complex and could easily be misinterpreted so we must approach with caution.’

Other GPs are much more critical, believing Mr Hunt is determined to undermine doctors’ credibility so he can drive down their pay – a charge the Health Secretary denies.

But others are supportive. Dr Neil Bacon, founder of doctor comparison site iWantGreatCare, said: ‘There’s a huge appetite from patients for information about their GPs. 

'More and more are realising that there’s such a variation in quality between them. Most are good; some are awful.’
