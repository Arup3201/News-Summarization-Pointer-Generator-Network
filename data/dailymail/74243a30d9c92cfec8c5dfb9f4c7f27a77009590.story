Casey Anthony’s six-week murder trial finally rested today as jurors were sent away to decide whether her two-year-old daughter was the victim of an accidental drowning that she covered up out of fear and grief, or was brutally murdered by a 'pathological liar' who wanted to live free and party.

Judge Belvin Perry dispatched the jury in Orlando, Florida, to consider their verdict after the state delivered an emotionally stirring rebuttal to the defence’s closing arguments, telling the panel of seven men and five woman that Caylee Anthony died in June 2008 at the hands of 'the most well documented liar ever seen in a courtroom.'

Anthony scowled, shook her head and at times mouthed her objections as prosecutors Jeff Ashton and Linda Drane-Burdick closed out their assertion that Caylee was suffocated deliberately by her mother and tossed in the woods to rot.

Pensive: Casey Anthony listens to the prosecution's rebuttal on the last day of arguments in her murder trial

Her decomposed remains were found in 
December 2008 with duct tape over her skull, where her nose and mouth 
would have been. The defence’s suggestions that her grandfather George 
Anthony put it there while disposing of her body was 'laughable'  and 
'oh so predictable,' jurors were told.

'Accusing others of lying is classic 
Casey Anthony. When Casey Anthony wants to turn attention away from 
herself, she accuses others,' said Ms Drane Burdick. 'A lie told 
convincingly is still a lie.'

Defence attorney Jose Baez told 
jurors during closing arguments yesterday that Caylee’s death was an 
'accident that snowballed out of control' after Caylee clambered alone 
into the swimming pool at her home in Orlando, Florida.

Anthony was an 'amazing mom' who was afraid of how to handle it and 'made some bad decisions.'

'She should have called police. She 
shouldn’t have attempted to block it out. She should have reported her 
death,' he said. 'But to paint Casey Anthony as a slut, as a party girl,
as a girl who lies, has nothing to do with how Caylee died.'

'Absurd': Prosecutor Jeff Ashton rejected the defence's claim that Caylee drowned in a pool in his final rebuttal

Family: George and Cindy Anthony, parents of Casey Anthony, leave court after the jury was sent out

Ms Drane-Burdick countered today: 
'What ‘amazing’ parent acts with complete indifference to the accidental
death of their child?' she asked.

'If this really was an accident in 
the pool, Caylee Anthony would have been found floating in a pool, not 
floating in a swamp down the street. People whose children have 
accidents do something…They call 911, they anguish over the death of a 
child.'

Instead, Anthony, 25, spent 31 days 
spinning yarns about her daughter being in the care of a nanny who 
turned out to be fictitious, went shopping, went to parties, went 
nightclubbing, and got herself a tattoo reading 'Bella vita' – Italian 
for 'beautiful life' – until the child’s grandmother Cindy called 
police.

'At the end of this case, all you 
have to really do is ask yourselves one simple question: Whose life was 
better without Caylee?' Ms Drane-Burdick told the jury.

'Was Cindy’s life better?' she asked,
playing a recording of the distraught grandmother weeping down the 
telephone to an emergency despatcher in July 2008 that Caylee was 
missing.

Decision: Judge Belvin Perry told the jury that their decision must be unanimous as they were sent out on Monday

'Was George Anthony’s life better,' 
she demanded, reminding them how Caylee’s grief-stricken grandfather 
attempted suicide after the little girl’s remains were found because he 
wanted to be with her.

'Whose life was better?' asked Ms 
Drane-Burdick in her final words to the court, pointing to a photograph 
of Anthony partying, and an image of her Bella Vita tattoo. 'There’s 
your answer.'

Anthony has pleaded not guilty to 
first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter and
lying to law enforcement.

The first-degree murder charge carries the 
potential of the death penalty.

All 12 jurors must agree for a guilty 
verdict to be delivered, though a subsequent death sentence would only 
require the agreement of seven.

Final: Casey Anthony is seen before the start of court yesterday as both sides gave their final arguments

The jury was selected from 
Clearwater, Florida, 100 miles from Orlando, because of the enormous 
media spotlight that has been on the case ever since Caylee’s 
disappearance in June 2008, before Anthony was even arrested.

Defence 
lawyers had argued that Anthony risked receiving an unfair trial, 
resulting in the judge and lawyers on both sides travelling to 
Clearwater to swear in jurors who they agreed were not tainted by the 
pre-trial publicity.

The panel has been sequestered since 
selection, meaning that they have not been allowed home for more than 
six weeks and have been protected from coverage, including being denied 
access to live television and allowed to read newspapers only with holes
cut in them where coverage of the trial was published.

Victim: Mystery surrounds the cause of Caylee Anthony's death

Addressing jurors before dispatching 
them to their deliberations, Judge Perry gave a timely reminder of the 
significance of the July 4 date – the 255th anniversary of America’s 
Declaration of Independence – and the legal responsibility now resting 
on their shoulders.

'Even if you don’t like the laws that must be applied, you must use them,' he said.

'For two centuries, we have agreed to a constitution and to live by the law.'
