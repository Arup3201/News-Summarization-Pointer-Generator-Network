Shocking footage has emerged of a driver who was found asleep in his car on a Sydney motorway in the middle of the night.

A motorist sent the video to Ray Hadley of 2GB radio, clearly unimpressed by what he has just come across.

He filmed the male driver who appeared to be having a snooze in the driver's seat while the car remained stationary on one of Australia's busiest freeways.

Shocking footage has emerged of a driver who was found asleep in his car on a Sydney motorway in the middle of the night

The footage was uploaded on YouTube yesterday, detailing the driver had 'passed out on the M1 motorway north of Sydney'.

The man's efforts to try and wake up the passed out driver were to no avail.

'Yo buddy, wake up!,' he yells at the driver.

Another driver stopped and tried to waken the man but to no avail

The man says the driver stopped in the left-hand lane as he approaches the vehicle with his camera. 

'Just stopped dead. Asleep, high beams on, no hazard lights... dude's asleep,' the man said.

'Dead set can't wake him up.'

Before the man surrenders, he takes a close up on the driver as he says: 'Off his f****** head. Unbelievable.'

The driver decided to have a snooze on one of Sydney's busiest highways at night
