How do shops trick us into spending more money?

Soft, lulling music to make us feel relaxed; changing rooms tucked away at the back of the shop so we can only reach them by walking past all the other sections; skinny mirrors to buoy our confidence; pleasant smells, and cheap bags of sweets by the tills that will catch us out as impulse buys: there are some cheeky high street sales tricks of which we're all aware.

But what about the small floor tiles, the complex escalator arrangements, the messy sales rails and the enormous supermarket trollies?

How do these sneaky in-store features encourage us, subconsciously, to spend, spend, spend ever more, more, more?

Victoria Pascoe, retail strategist at advertising agency Inferno, has shared some of the industry's most hush-hush secrets with Femail.

Keep them in mind and maybe this Christmas you'll exit the shopping centre with only the things you really need....

ORIENTATION

Shops,
especially the larger department stores and supermarkets, are cleverly 
laid out to encourage you explore new areas of the floor and encounter 
new products you would have otherwise overlooked.

To encourage you into the building escalators are placed at the front of the shop, but you may find that the only route down is via stairs at the back of the store

1.   
 Have you noticed that changing rooms are positioned right at the back 
of the shop? In the same thinking, store layout is periodically altered 
to ensure we don't march straight to what we need but instead have to 
encounter new temptations.

2.   
When traveling up or down escalators you'll find you have to walk all 
the way around the stairwell to find the connecting escalator. Also, to 
encourage you into the building escalators are placed at the front of 
the shop, but you may find that the only route down is via stairs at the
back of the store.

SPEED-BUMPS

To slow us down and linger for longer amongst the products on offer we are presented with a series of disruptions.

3.   'Power displays' get in the way of a straight path, distracting our line of sight and altering our speed.

4.    Mirrors bring out the vanity in us as it’s proven we often will pause for a second to check our reflections.

SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE

Ingenious subliminal tricks come into play here.

5.   
The soundtrack to our shopping experience is often soft-tempo relaxing 
music, to lull us into a relaxed, even hypnotic state; often there will 
be no vocals to avoid distraction.

6.   
Floor tiles may be smaller to make us feel we are walking too fast and 
so we slow down and admire the goods on offer accordingly.

7.   
Changing room mirrors might be distorted to make us look longer and 
leaner, sadly making us think the clothes we are trying on are more 
flattering than they are.

8.   
Supermarket trolleys tend to be much bigger than they really need to 
be, so they fill up slowly leave us with plenty of room to keep adding 
more items.

SALES ITEMS

Unlike
the buy-one-get-one-free offers on full price (or inflated priced items
as we are hearing about) retailers are less eager for shoppers to use 
up their shopping budgets on the sales items where their margins are 
smaller.

9.    Clearance 
items are usually tucked away at the back of the shop, so we are enticed
by the more expensive goods on our way to the bargains.

10.   
Sales goods are often poorly organised, with unclear pricing, sizes and
layout, frustrating us and tempting us back to the beautifully 
presented full price products.

UPSELLING

Sales staff are trained with savvy tricks of the trade. They will constantly try to ‘up-sell’.

11.   
When shown the matching gloves, earrings or socks for under your new 
boots we find that even if we don’t need it, we will want it. You also 
see this on line, where items are suggested based on your purchase or 
viewing history.

12.    When
handed baskets upon entering we are made to feel obligated to fill them
with more than one item before we get to the tills.

13.    Then of course we’ve all noticed the array of low-cost goods positioned by tills to encourage impulse purchases.

TRICKS ON THE EYE

Such
a simple but effective trick is to catch our eyes. When hurried we will
often grab the first thing we see, or quickly glance and believe the 
value promotions without considering the maths.

14.   
In supermarkets you will always find the premium, branded items, at eye
level. Promotions, like the controversial bulk deals we are hearing 
about at the moment are also made clearly visible, at eye line height, 
or near changing rooms, escalators and tills.

15.   
Prices are labelled so that at a glance we think the deal is better 
than it is. Horizontal numbers are placed further apart so that the 
price deal seems greater, or sale prices are displayed in a much bigger 
font to emphasise the difference. We are also made accustomed to 
labelling colours and with an instinct of trust we follow the cue to 
purchased, not realising that more sneaky tactics are at play, as we 
have learned in the news this week.
