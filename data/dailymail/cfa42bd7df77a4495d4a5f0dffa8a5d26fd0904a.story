An elderly woman who has admitted to killing her husband 28 years ago and she has only been sentenced to spend six months in jail.

Carolyn Sue Krizan-Wilson entered a guilty plea in the unsolved mystery of who killed her husband Roy McCaleb on September 20, 1985.

McCaleb's children are happy with her guilty plea and feel that her light sentence- of only six months behind bars and 10 years probation- is sufficient.

Admitting her guilt: Carolyn Krizan-Wilson, 71, entered a guilty plea 28 years after killing her husband

Cold case: After believing Krizan-Wilson's story about a mystery barefoot rapist who attacked her and then killed her husband Roy McCaleb (right), police let the trail run cold (she was arrested in 2008, pictured)

'She is willingly admitting that she murdered him and that's something we've known all these years,' McCaleb's daughter Pam Nalley told The Houston Chronicle.

'I think that means more to me than anything.'

Krizan-Wilson was 43 at the time of the murder had been married to 50-year-old McCaleb for two years when she killed him.

For decades, investigators believed the story she told them about how her husband ended up shot to death by a mysterious barefoot man.

Krizan-Wilson told the police that more than a week before her husband's death she was carjacked and raped by an unknown man.

McCaleb, a construction foreman, had just had back surgery and she said that she never reported the fictitious carjacking because she feared that it would cause her husband to have a slower recovery.

Tragic: The victim's daughter Pamela Nalley said that she was satisfied by the six-month sentence with 10 years probation, saying that she just wanted to hear Krizan-Wilson admit to her crime

Sad closure: McCaleb's sister Linda Petty got emotional in the Houston court on Wednesday

Then, she claimed, on the night of September 22, that same knife-wielding barefoot attacker broke into the couple's home through an unlocked door.

The Houston Chronicle tells how she added specific details to the alleged break in: the man scraped her with a coat hanger and poured hot wax on her before threatening her with a knife and raping her like he reportedly had 10 days prior.

Krizan-Wilson, who is now 71, added that after the rape, the man took the gun that she kept underneath her pillow and shot her husband while he slept.

One key addition is that she said she bumped into the man as he was running out, causing him to drop the gun.

Connected: When she was originally arrested in 2008, Krizan-Wilson was working as a civilian employee at the Houston Police department where her two sons (not pictured) were officers

She allegedly picked it up and fired two shots at him, an important detail as it would have explained the reason why any of her fingerprints and gun residue would be found after the shooting.

The case ran cold when they could not find any suspects, but it was reopened in 2008 and Krizan-Wilson was not indicted because of the amount of time that had passed since the crime.

By 2008, she was working as a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department and her two sons were police officers. It is not know if McCaleb was either of their fathers.

Over the past five years, the case has been in and out of appeal hearings, and on Wednesday she was finally sentenced. Her half-year in jail will begin in late December.

Her lawyer told The Chronicle that she is suffering from dementia.
