An infant school has launched a new crackdown on parents who pick up their children late from school - by fining them £6 if they turn up more than 15 minutes late.

Germander Park School in Milton Keynes wants to discourage parents from treating it as a 'childcare provider' by charging whenever it has to look after pupils outside school hours.

But many parents are furious about the fining regime, saying it is unfair to families with multiple children and could prove ruinous to less wealthy people.

Tough: Germander Park School in Milton Keynes is fining parents £6 an hour for collecting their children late

The school, which is located in the Conniburrow area and whose pupils go up to Year Two, told parents in a letter last week that they would have to pay £6 for every hour they were late after 3.15pm.

The announcement came soon after another Milton Keynes school revealed that it would charge parents £60 if their children turned up late in the morning.

Emerson Valley School imposed the fine in a tough new disciplinary drive, but parents spoke out against the move.

One mother at Germander Park today spoke of her anger at the policy, saying: 'I found the letter in my four-year-old son's bag. I'm not sure that was the best way to inform parents.

'Conniburrow is not a rich place. People on benefits might not be able to pay the fines and then what are they going to do?

'I have children in three different schools across Milton Keynes, I can't be in all those places at the same time and sometimes I'll be delayed.'

Letter: A copy of the note sent to all parents by the school last week outlining the policy

Interim headmistress Sonia Hunt said that parents could be fined even if they arrived just five minutes later than the designated time, but insisted that no one would be penalised if they had a valid reason for their delay.

In a statement, the school said: 'The letter which we sent out is not new. It has been in place since 2011. 'All parents have seen it in the school prospectus and it is on our website.

'In September the previous headteacher 
reminded parents of the policy in her newsletter which was sent home in 
book bags - this is our standard practice.

'Unfortunately it is becoming increasingly frequent that some parents are collecting children late from school.

'May we remind you that school finish time is 3pm daily and you should be at school prompt to collect your child at this time.

'We understand that occasionally emergencies do arise and appreciate this can lead to the late collection of children.

'If you have a genuine emergency and know you will be late collecting your child, it is ESSENTIAL you let the school know.

'However,
 for those parents who collect their child late from school without 
giving a valid reason, we will be introducing a childcare charge in line
 with other childcare providers, of £6 per hour if your child remains in
 school after 3.15pm.

'This charge will be collected by the school office on the day.'

'In January a reminder of this was sent out. We are always sympathetic to our families and will support them in any way we can if we are notified of any pick-up problem. Obviously in these cases no charges would be raised.

'However, there have been occasions where parents have been exceptionally late with no reason given and we have been unable to contact them.'

Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said fining parents was the wrong way to address the issue.

He said: 'The fines for taking children out of school for holidays - that's fine. But the idea of fining parents £6 at the end of the day is completely new to me.

'Fines should only be issued in very, very extreme circumstances and as a total last resort.

'Schools are communities of families and this will break the relationship between the school and the parents. This undermines that sense of community that the school needs.

'I have been in that situation when you're waiting at the end of the day for parents to collect their children. I got very annoyed, but if it's a persistent thing you should contact social services.'

Germander Park may even find that the plan to curb tardiness could backfire - in one well-known case, detailed in the 2005 best-seller Freakonomics, it was found that fining parents for being late only encouraged them to be later.

The counter-intuitive result came because parents no longer felt guilty about being late picking their children up if they were able to 'buy off' their guilt with a small fine.
