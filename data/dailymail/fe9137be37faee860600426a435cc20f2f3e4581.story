What started out as a trip of a lifetime won on The Ellen DeGeneres Show ended with a U.S. Marine plunging to his death from a plane in Australia.

Brandon McGraw, 33, a Marine from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, was pronounced dead in Euroa, Australia, after a freak accident during a skydiving excursion with his wife, Cherilyn.

According to a report in The Jacksonville Daily News, McGraw, an Afghan War veteran, watched his wife do a tandem jump and then exited the plane.

In an interview with the newspaper, an employee of the skydiving school said McGraw’s jump was going fine until shortly before landing, when his parachute suddenly veered left and right and he slammed into the ground.

The 33-year-old gunnery sergeant was pronounced dead on the scene at around 12.30pm local time after going into cardiac arrest. His wife was not injured.

On January 16, 2012, Cherilyn McGraw went on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and won the Stuff Your Down Under Pants contest, taking home a trip for two to Australia.

A clip from the episode in which Mrs McGraw and her rivals had to stuff oversize 'pants' with balls shows the young woman clapping and jumping up and down following her victory.

The Huntington couple, who got married in November 2011, made the long trip to Australia this past weekend with a stopover in New York City.

McGraw’s final Facebook message contained the photo of a nude statue of an angel caressing her breast and holding a skull in Melbourne, Australia, with the caption: 'Lust in one hand and Death in the other. I bet her name is Angel.'

Capt. Barry Morris, with Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command, told the station WTKR that McGraw, an extreme sports enthusiast, was a well-trained and experienced skydiver with many jumps under his belt. 

The 33-year-old had served both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and had just returned from his third tour of duty. He was assigned to Company G, 2d Marine Special Operations Battalion stationed in Camp Lejeune. 

Neighbor William Sidberry told WWAY3 that McGraw was a very friendly and open person who loved serving his country.

On her Facebook page, the Marine’s inconsolable widow eulogized her husband, calling him her ‘hero’ and ‘angel.’ She also shared Brandon’s haunting final photos showing him grinning aboard the plane before his fateful skydive.

‘These are truly such symbolic photos,’ she wrote. ‘He was happy and doing what he loved. It's amazing all that photos can capture in a moments time… I love you more than anything in the world, honey. You are the most amazing man.’

Less than a week before his tragic death, Brandon McGraw wrote a long post on his Facebook account in memory of seven Marines, among them several close friends from his unit, who died in a December 8, 1999 helicopter crash.

‘Less than 2 years later 9-11 happened and ushered in 10 years of combat and a lot of casualties, so this small incident has been largely forgotten - but I shall never forget,’ the sergeant wrote.

McGraw's death marks the first fatality in the 30-year history of the Euroa Skydive, an Australian skydiving school.

Ian Matthew, who works for the school, said the American skydiving enthusiast and his wife had the required training and proper documentation necessary for a solo jump.

Although the cause of the deadly crash remains under investigation, Australian news media have suggested that windy conditions may have played a role.
