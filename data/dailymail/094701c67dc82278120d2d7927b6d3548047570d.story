When Jonny Normal came down with a cough and a high temperature, he joked it was 'man flu'.

Weeks later, having been put into an induced coma, doctors warned his family they may have to turn off his life support machine.

Mr Normal's flu had developed into pneumonia, where an infection causes the tissue in the lungs to swell, causing difficulty breathing.

Incredibly, while his family had come to say their goodbyes, the now-47-year-old showed signs of life, and woke up from the coma a few days later.

Scans showed he had also suffered a stroke, and though he was left paralysed for six months, he learned to speak and walk again is now at home with his family.

Jonny Normal, 47, joked about having man flu but days later was rushed to hospital and put in a coma and on a life support machine for two weeks. He was suffering pneumonia, an infection which causes the lungs to swell, causing difficulty breathing

Mr Normal was sent for  extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment, where an artificial lung pumps blood around the body. But he did not respond to treatment and remained in a coma. He is pictured with his wife Andrea, 45, before he fell ill

Doctors worried that Mr Normal would be brain damaged due to lack of oxygen to the brain, and suggested turning off his life support. But when his wife and family came to say goodbye he blinked, showing he was conscious. He is pictured here with his family before becoming ill

Mr Normal, from Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, said: 'I'd been joking about having man flu earlier in the week.

'I had a high temperature and felt lethargic. It just seemed like a normal cold. I was so healthy I couldn't understand how it could happen.'

Mr Normal made light of his symptoms and likened them to 'man flu' on the radio show he runs.

But after five days, he was rushed into hospital and told he had pneumonia, which can be caused by the virus that causes flu.

His wife Andrea, 45, said: 'When I came home from work, I found Johnny under a blanket and he didn't look well but he just said he had flu.

'But the next day he was throwing up and his temperature was through the roof. He had breathing problems too so I rang 999 in a panic.'

When Mr Normal arrived at Warwick Hospital in March 2014, doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia and he was transferred to the intensive care unit at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham.

He was put on life support, which pumped oxygen round his system, and was transferred to Leicester Hospital.

His wife Andrea was given hospital accommodation so she could stay with her husband, but asked her parents to look after their two daughters Olivia, now 15, and Eve, 10.

Doctors warn that symptom of pneumonia include having a cough, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, a fever, shivering or a pain in the chest.

The NHS website advises visiting a GP if you have any of these symptoms.

Dr Mike Smith, a former GP, told MailOnline: 'Most cases of pneumonia from late childhood to old age are broncho pneumonia.

'The infection crawls down into the smaller breathing tubes, which get filled with gunge, causing a bit of wheezing.

'Doctors hear crackles on the stethoscope from the liquid in the lungs that shouldn’t be there.

'This liquid makes a perfect environment from which bacteria will grow and cause the lungs to swell.'

Dr Smith said it is difficult to ascertain when a person has flu and when they have pneumonia, as the symptoms are very similar.

Therefore he advises seeing a doctor if there is any concern.

He said: 'Other than a doctor being able to hear that crackling in your chest, there’s nothing specific in pneumonia.

'In terms of symptoms, it’s difficult to tell flu and pneumonia  apart.

'You start to feel more ill than usual with pneumonia.

'You might well have a temperature and feel awful. You’ll be coughing up gunge. 

'You should go and see your GP if you have any concerns your flu is more than just a passing virus.'

Mrs Normal said: 'He looked so frail. I didn't want them to see their dad like that.'

Mr Normal's liver and kidneys were failing and doctors told his wife he had Influenza A and Bocavirus - a pathogen which is believed to cause respiratory infections - which were affecting his breathing.

She said: 'I tried to reassure our girls the doctors were doing their best for him.

'But then I was told there wasn't enough oxygen in Johnny's blood and with time, his organs would shut down.

'I didn't understand how flu could do that so quickly.'

For the next 11 days doctors monitored Mr Normal and tried to bring him off life support.

He was transferred to the Glenfield Hospital in Leicester for two sessions of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a treatment given to patients with severe lung failure.

Here, a machine acts like an artificial lung, taking blood from the lungs, removing carbon dioxide and then oxygenating it, before returning it to the body.

But Mr Normal didn't respond to the treatment and showed no signs of coming round.

His wife said: 'Doctors feared he'd been starved of oxygen and suffered brain damage.

'There wasn't much they could do for him though I begged them to give him a chance.

'They said it wasn't fair on his body and wanted to let him die naturally.'

However they said they would give Mr Normal steroids until he passed away, and a ventilator would breathe for him.

In the meantime, his wife had to go through the agony of preparing her family for her husband's death.

She said: 'I called our girls so they could see their dad and we told him we loved him and hoped he'd come round.

'We sat round his bed holding his hand.

'We thought it was the end.'

When Mr Normal woke up, scans revealed he had also suffered a stroke. He was paralysed for six months, and had to re-learn to walk and speak again 

After being in a coma for a fortnight, Mr Normal suffered complete muscle wastage and was transferred for physiotherapy. He was allowed home in September 2014, and still has trouble breathing. He is pictured with his daughter Eve, 10,  and their dog Charlie, before he became ill

But, miraculously, just days later, Mr Normal opened his eyes.

His wife said: 'I told him if he could hear me, he should blink.

'When he did, my heart was in my mouth.

'It was just a tiny movement but to me it was everything.'

After this, doctors watched Mr Normal's ventilator for signs he was breathing. 

A fortnight later he took his first breath, and began to move and speak again.

Mrs Normal said: 'Gradually, Johnny spoke and moved his right side, but not his left. A scan showed he'd had a stroke.'

Mr Normal was transferred for physiotherapy, after suffering muscle wastage due to being in a coma for a fortnight, and weeks later took his first steps.

Mrs Normal said: 'His therapist and I coaxed him on by saying he had to get better to walk his girls down the aisle one day.

'I was so proud. I couldn't believe how far he'd come.'

Mr Normal is grateful to be back at home with his family. He said: 'Even just sitting at home watching a DVD with Andrea and the girls is magical, it's something I thought I'd never have again'

Mr Normal was allowed home in September 2014.

After suffering lung damage he now struggles to take air into his lungs but doctors say this will improve with time.

The father-of-two said: 'I can remember hearing the doctor say they were putting me in a coma, I thought that was game over.

'I've had to learn everything from scratch, learn to eat and swallow again.

'But with Andrea's help, I'm walking again now.

'Even just sitting at home watching a DVD with Andrea and the girls is magical, it's something I thought I'd never have again.'
