How to stop Lionel Messi ?

It is a question that has confounded most teams facing Barcelona for the last 10 years.

And in this tournament Messi has at last weaved his mesmerising magic for Argentina on a consistent basis.

Swiss boss Ottmar Hitzfeld is a precise type of coach in his preparation and may consider the idea of man-marking Messi given the Swiss side’s preferred 4-3-1-2 formation. Former West Ham player Valon Behrami could be utilised in such a role.

But former France World Cup winner Partick Vieira who suffered a chastening experience when he first came up against Messi on his Juventus debut after leaving Arsenal thinks that would be a wrong tactical move.

'It would be a huge mistake to man mark Messi,' said Vieira. 'He can just beat his marker or move and make openings for others. The only thing you can really do is give less space like Iran did. They played by getting close and being aggressive but late they got tired and dropped off him a little. That’s all he needed to score.'

Of that first meeting when Messi was just 18, Vieira added: ‘I tried to kick him… I tried to scare him but every time you fouled him he put the ball down on the floor, took a free kick and was off again looking for the ball.

'He always shows real bravery and courage and plays for the team'

There is something about left-footed players. The best of them wield their left leg like a magic wand and the right foot is often just there to balance on.

Puskas, Maradona, Hagi were all masters and now of course there is Messi.

All four of his goals at this World Cup have been scored with his left foot.

Mind you, so far 54 goals - 36 per cent – of all goals in Brazil have been scored with the left peg.

So far Belgium have lived up to their billing as the clever-money dark-horse tip.

The USA though have shown the energy and attacking menace to put Mark Wilmots’ side to their test.

And in football there is always a tipping moment when a run comes to an end.

In the 20 games that keeper Thibaut Courtois has played for Belgium they have never lost. Is now the time?

By the way, although Atletico Madrid want to extend his loan, Chelsea are set to take him back after the finals and make him their No 1.

The Americans love dubbing their sports stars with sobriquets.

So surely Michael Bradley, their 26-year-old midfielder son of former USA coach Bob and who plays for Toronto, should be called Marathon Man.

In their first three group games he covered 23.6 miles

Germany squeezed through against Algeria as Brazil did with Costa Rica.

Now it is Colombia against Brazil in the quarter-final and Germany vs France, which could mean a Brazil vs Germany semi-final.

A World Cup classic in the making?

Incredibly these two World Cup super-powers have only met once in its 84 year history - the 2002 final in Japan, which Brazil won 2-0

I-Say

Despite some of the bad baggage that has come with this World Cup - bribery allegations about FIFA, betting rumours surrounding Ghana, match fixing claims surrounding Cameroon and, of course, Luis Suarez - on the pitch it has continued to be enthralling and dramatic continuing into the knockout stage.

Even if some of the games have been tighter and more gruelling this is heading for the best finals in terms of the football since 1970.

Let’s hope it continues and the enduring image of this tournament is the buena vistas of Brazil’s beaches and Joga Bonito on the pitch

World Cup Bet

Both Tuesday’s games look to be tight, so a draw double at 90 minutes could be on the cards.

Argentina and Switzerland is 3-1 for the draw, while it’s 21-10 with Belgium and USA.

But if you are feeling adventurous then Clint Dempsey to score and USA to win is 7-1.

Messi to score first and Argentina to win is 7-2. 

One to Watch

Swiss front man Xherdan Shaqiri hit the 50th hat trick in World Cup history when the Swiss beat Honduras 3-0.

He is the player who gives the robust hard working Swiss side a cutting edge.

The Bayern striker, who is wanted by Liverpool, can upset the Messi roadshow.

World Cup moment

France vs Germany’s quarter-final prompts memories of the semi-final clash between the two countries in 1982.

It was an incredible match in Seville, which ended 3-3 with Germany winning on penalties, the first time a World Cup semi-final had been settled that way

But it is best remembered for the horror clash in which Germany keeper Harald Schumacher brutally took out France striker Patrick Battiston.

It should have been a penalty and a red card - perhaps more, given how badly Battiston was bashed up - but Schumacher got off scott free.
