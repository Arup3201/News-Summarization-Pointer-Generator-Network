Two Nato troops have been killed in southern Afghanistan on a day of violence in the war-torn country that also saw a rogue policeman shoot dead nine sleeping officers.

One Nato service member died in a 
roadside bomb explosion this morning and the other in an insurgent 
attack yesterday.

No further details were disclosed, but the deaths bring the number of international troops killed in Afghanistan so far this year to 88.

A suspected U.S. drone fired two missiles at a house in north-west Pakistan this morning, killing four militants.

The attack comes as Pakistani officials have stepped up their calls for the strikes to end, intelligence officials said.

It could complicate U.S. efforts to get Pakistan to reopen its border crossings to supplies meant for Nato troops in Afghanistan.

Pakistan shut the border last November in retaliation for American airstrikes that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers.

The country's parliament is debating a revised framework for its relationship with the U.S. that Washington hopes will result in Nato supply routes reopening.

But a key demand is that the U.S. stop drone attacks, which are very unpopular in Pakistan because many people believe they mostly kill civilians - a claim denied by the U.S. and contradicted by independent research.

Today's strike targeted a house in Miran Shah, the main town in the North Waziristan tribal area, a key sanctuary for Taliban and al-Qaida militants, Pakistani intelligence officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The four militants killed in the strike and three wounded were from Uzbekistan, said the officials. Their precise identities were unclear but the attack occurred while the group was sleeping.

In the eastern Paktika province, an 
Afghan policeman killed nine of his fellow officers as they slept in the
 early hours of this morning.

Local police blamed the attack, which took place in the town of Yayakhi, on the Taliban.

The province's police chief Dawlat Khan Zadran identified the gunman as Asadullah, who goes by one name.

Bowal Khan, the district's chief, said the shooter was assigned to a small command post when he woke up at 3am for guard duty.

He then used his assault rifle to 
kill the nine men sleeping inside the post, took their weapons and piled
 them in a pickup truck.

According to Mr Khan, Asadullah then sped away in the truck.

The victims included one of his 
brothers and the commander of the post, identified as Mohammad Ramazan. 
Two of the dead were Ramazan's sons.

The motive for the killing was not known, but police in the area blamed the Taliban for the attack.

Paktikan is a stronghold of the Haqqani network, a Pakistani-based group with ties to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. Although they mostly attack U.S.-led coalition forces, they have often carried out assaults and bombings against the Afghan army and police.

Mr Zadran said: 'This man is a coward. What he did is part of the Taliban conspiracy.'

The killer's two brothers are being held for questioning.

The village police is also known as 
the Afghan Local Police, or ALP. It is a village-level force that 
provides security in areas where the Afghan army and police cannot.

The ALP is trained by the U.S. troops but commanded and run by the Afghan government and police.

In
 an unrelated incident, a motorcycle bomb parked by the side of a road 
exploded on Friday and killed an Afghan police officer and wounded 
another in Sangin district of southwest Helmand province.

Another police officer was shot and killed outside his house in the capital of Helmand last night.
