A cow was today shot dead by armed police after escaping from a ferry and swimming around a harbour for almost five hours.

The animal plunged into the water while being loaded from a NorthLink vessel onto a road transport float in Aberdeen Harbour shortly after 8am.

But after efforts to coax it back onto dry land failed, it was shot by police marksmen.

This afternoon, a Police Scotland spokesman said: 'We assisted with the recovery of the animal which unfortunately had to be humanely destroyed on the advice of a vet.

'Destruction of the animal was the last resort. Public safety and animal welfare were considered after all other efforts to restrain the animal were unsuccessful.'

Aberdeen Coastguard first spotted the black cow swimming among boats in the busy turning basin at the harbour, around half a mile away from the spot where it dived in, this morning.

An RNLI inshore lifeboat were scrambled to the scene, but the crew found 
the were forced to keep their distance because the 'distressed' animal kept charging at the vessel.

Rescuers managed to get the cow out of deep water and onto a narrow sea-wall on the quayside by 9.15am, while shipping vessels and large oil and gas supply boats sailed by just 100 yards away.

There, they made several attempts
to coax the animal to a sloped area as the tide continued to rise.

However, the cow refused to 
cooperate with them and could be seen growing increasingly tired as crowds gathered along the quay to watch the drama unfold.

Battered and bruised: As the hours went by, the tide continued to rise, battering the stricken cow with waves

Harbour
 authorities could be heard on dockside radios ordering stunned boat 
captains to stay to the south side of the harbour as 'there 
is a cow in the water'.

As the hours went by, the tide continued to come in, battering the stricken animal with waves.

At one point, the cow could be seen walking towards the inner harbour, before seemingly changing its mind and returning further out towards the port exit to the North Sea.

'A last resort': At around 1pm, rescuers decided they were left with no choice but to call in police marksmen, who shot the cow as a 'last resort' (pictured). Dozens of onlookers watched as the cow collapsed in the water

At around 1pm, rescuers decided they were left with no choice but to call in police marksmen, who shot the cow twice as a 'last resort'.

Dozens of onlookers watched as the animal collapsed in the water, before lifeboat crews attached a rope to its body and dragged it out of the harbour by tug boat.

The harbour channel was closed temporarily during the incident, but has since been reopened.Â
