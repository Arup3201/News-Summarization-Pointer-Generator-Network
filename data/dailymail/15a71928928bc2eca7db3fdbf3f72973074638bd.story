Jamie Heaton was watching television when the blast tore through several houses in Shaw, Oldham, on June 26.

His parents Michelle and Kenny led around 400 mourners into the funeral at nearby St James Church today as hundreds more people listened to the service on loudspeakers outside.

Tragic loss: Jamie Heaton's parents arrive for the funeral. The youngster was watching television when a blast tore through several houses in Shaw, Oldham, on June 26

Emotional: After the couple had walked by, an officer wiped a tear from his eye

One police officer struggled to keep hold of his emotions after the couple walked past him next to the church gates.

Jamie’s body was carried into the church in a small white coffin with polka dots in red, orange, purple and green.

Mr
Heaton, 36, and other male mourners wore ties in the same design - 
inspired by the little boy’s favourite children’s TV star, Mr Tumble.

Flowers in red and orange spelled out 'Jamie' and 'Little Man.'

As the funeral began, the theme to Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends was played.

The
Rev Lynne Connolly, who led the service, said Jamie’s family had 
appreciated the support shown by the local community since 'that 
horrible day.'

'The tragic death of Jamie has devastated us all,' she said.

After
the hymn Amazing Grace was sung, the toddler’s mother Michelle, 31, 
stepped to the altar and sobbed as she read out the poem Footprints.

The
poem ended: 'My precious, precious child I love you and would never 
leave you. During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only 
one set of footprints, it was then that I carried you.'

Mrs Heaton, who works for Boots, 
miraculously survived the blast which killed her son after stepping out 
to hang out washing in the yard.

The song You’ll Never Walk Alone was then played to the congregation.

The
explosion was so big that it destroyed a house next door killing 
the two-year-old  who was watching TV in the lounge as his mother put the
washing out 
to dry in their back yard.

Two-year-old Jamie died in an explosion which flattened his family's home in Shaw, near Oldham

A 32-year-old man - thought to be a gas fitter - was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following Jamie's death and has since been bailed until August 9.

The Heatons' neighbour, Andrew 
Partington, 27, suffered serious burns in the blast and remains in a 
serious condition at Wythenshawe hospital's burns unit.

In a tribute read out by a male 
relative on behalf of Jamie's parents today, the youngster was described
as a 'happy little boy, mischievous and full of laughter.'

The tribute went on: 'He loved 
watching Mr Tumble every day. He was in his element in the outdoors, he 
loved his freedom, going to the park and playing on the slides.

'He adored his family and his brother and sister, Jack and Jodie.

'His personality was unique and amazing - Jamie was unique and amazing. We will miss everything about him.

'Even though we only had a short time 
with him, the time we had was special and his memory will live on 
through Jack and Jodie and everyone close to him.

'Over the last few days we have been allowed some quality time with Jamie and he looked so peaceful and perfect.

We take comfort in the fact that he passed away quickly and without much suffering.

'He is in a safe place and we know he is being well looked after by those around him.

'We have no doubts that he will be up to mischief, looking down on us with that smile - his smile.'

He added that Jamie's parents were 'overwhelmed' with the 'tremendous support, kind words and gifts' they had received.

He thanked the couple's families, the local community and the emergency services for their bravery and support.'

'Our thoughts are also with the neighbours whose lives have also been turned upside down over the last few days,' he said.

'We are all going to miss our little man.'
