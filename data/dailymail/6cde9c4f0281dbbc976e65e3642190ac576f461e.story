First, many parents decided to avoid giving their children the MMR jab because of alleged - and now disproven - links to autism.

Now, the rejection of vaccines seems to be catching on with pet owners, potentially putting animals at risk.

Among the jabs that they are refusing, are canine distemper and parvovirus, which can both prove fatal, New York magazine reported. However, it is illegal for owners not to protect their pets from rabies. 

A number of vets in the US have noticed a trend for people who are reluctant to vaccinate their pets. Among the jabs that owners are refusing, are those for canine distemper and parvovirus, which can both prove fatal. A stock image of a dog being given a jab is shown

MailOnline has asked a handful of UK organisations if there is a similar trend in the UK.

Christopher Brockett, president of the New York State Veterinary Medical Society, is one of the experts who have seen pet owners skipping vaccinations.  

The fewer animals that are being vaccinateed for canine distemper, (pictured), the greater the chance of a 'firestorm', one vet said

‘The fewer animals that are getting the vaccine [for canine distemper], the greater the likelihood that you’re going to have a firestorm if something that is that highly communicable comes along,’ he said.

Blog posts advocating skipping jabs, claim they can cause arthritis, cancers and epilepsy among other diseases, but these claims are largely unproven.

Writing in an article for Pet MD, Dr TJ Dunn Jr said: 'Part of the drive for reconsideration of vaccine protocols has been coming from holistic veterinary practitioners, many of whom believe that repeated vaccinations diminish the animal's immune resources and can actually create disorders such as degenerative joint diseases, immune mediated disorders such as Lupus, and can actually depress the animal's ability to ward off diseases "naturally".

'A few holistic veterinarians believe that all vaccines are harmful.' 

Brennen McKenzie, a blogger and past president of the Evidence-Based Veterinary Medicine Association, told the magazine that the trend for ignoring vaccinations may be because views about human medicine have spilled over into the veterinary world. 

It is thought that more dogs are suffering from canine distemper, which causes potentially fatal respiratory and gastrointestinal problems, but there are no national statistics to support anecdotal evidence. Computer artwork of canine parvovirus is pictured

Canine distemper is a viral disease that affects dogs and racoons, for example.

In dogs, it attaches the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts as well as the spinal cord and brain.

Symptoms include: high fever, eye inflammation, laboured breathing, vomiting and diarrhoea, loss of appetite and lethargy, and hardening of nose and footpads.

It's caused by an RNA virus from the same family of the virus that causes measles in humans.

It's highly contagious via inhalation and fatal half the time.

Canine parvovirus is spread by direct or indirect contact with dog faeces.

Symptoms appear within three and seven days, including: lethargy, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, which can lead to dogs getting dehydrated and anaemic.

If the virus progresses, white blood cell levels fail, resulting in shock and even death.

‘Over the last 10 or 15 years there has been an increase in mostly unfounded concerns about vaccine safety for people - and that, I think, has raised people’s awareness and level of concern about vaccinations for their pets,’ he said.

Unlike with children, no agency tracks how many pets get their recommended vaccinations, so no-one knows how bad the problem may be if a nasty disease was to sweep a city’s parks. 

It's thought that more dogs are suffering from canine distemper, which causes potentially fatal respiratory and gastrointestinal problems, but there are no national statistics to support anecdotal evidence.

Some vets advocating alternative medicine even advise avoiding vaccinations.

Rosemary Manziano, a homeopathic veterinarian in New Jersey, reportedly recommends taking puppies more than 12 weeks old – whose immune systems are fully formed - to the park to play with other animals instead of getting them vaccinated against canine distemper.

This advice seems to echo that of parents who take their unvaccinated children to ‘pox parties’ in the hope that by mixing with others who have chickenpox or measles, for example, their children may build up natural immunity.

Other vets claim that it is impossible to introduce a puppy to an environment in order to pick up a disease without putting the dog, or other animals, at risk.

A spokesman for the British Veterinary Association  and British Small Animal Veterinary Association told MailOnline:‘Vaccinations are an extraordinary tool in our armoury in the fight against diseases, both in animals and humans. 

'Under the Animal Welfare Act owners have a duty to protect their animals from pain, injury, suffering and disease. 

We know of no better, and scientifically proven, way to protect against disease than vaccination. 

Sadly, we know from the MMR vaccine in children that scaremongering can lead to a loss of public confidence in vaccination and knee-jerk reactions that can lead to outbreaks of disease. 

'Distemper and parvo virus are still killers – and the reason we no longer see these on a wider scale is because most owners sensibly choose to vaccinate.’
