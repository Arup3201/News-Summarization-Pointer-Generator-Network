Another Republican, Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul, ranked ranked no. 2 on the list in 2013 with a minimum net worth of $117.54 million.

McCaul is not independently wealthy, Roll Call points out. Nearly all of the assets listed on the Texas Representatives' financial disclosure form are in his wife Linda's name. McCaul's wife is the daughter of the founder of Clear Channel Communications.

Issa and McCaul were the only Republicans to make the top 10 richest lawmakers list.

Rounding at the top-tier of the list were: Maryland Rep. John Delaney, West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, Colorado Rep. Jared Polis, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, California Rep. Scott Peters, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Washington Rep. Susan DelBene.

Republicans were more financially successful than Democrats overall, however, with 30 Republican lawmakers rising to the cream of the crop compared to only 20 Democrats.

White, male members of Congress were also more likely to be wealthy than their colleagues. Just nine women made this year's 50 richest list. And every one of the most well-off members of Congress was white. 

While the Senate is considered the more prestigious of the legislative chambers two chamber, the members of Congress who have the most were more likely to serve in the House of Representatives. A mere 15 Senators made this year's list.

CQ Roll Call has analyzing lawmakers' financial disclosure forms and rank ordering them since 1990.

The news organization determines how much each member is approximately worth by subtracting the total minimum amount of their reported liabilities from the total minimum amount of their reported assets.

Roll Call is unable to break down each members exact net worth because federal financial disclosure forms allow them to ascribe a value range to assets. 

Furthermore, members don't have to list the value of their homes, only the price of their mortgages. They also don't have to say how much money they've invested in their federal retirement funds.

Roll Call tries to keep the playing field as fair as possible by assuming the lowest amount of liabilities for a member within the reported range, as well as the lowest amount of assets.

In addition to calculating which members of Congress have the most wealth, Roll Call determined which Members of Congress had the lowest net worth.

Because mortgages are listed as liabilities on federal forms and home values are not listed as assets, many of the poorest Members of Congress have negative net worth despite owning more than one home.

Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for example, has a net worth of -$972,000 even though she has two homes. Contributing to the Florida Representative's negative ranking is a $250,000 home equity line of credit and a personal bank loan of more than $100,000.

The Democratic Party official and her husband are also carrying $15,000 in credit card debt, Roll Call discovered.

The Congressmen and women that made Roll Call's list of poorest lawmakers -  in order of how much they had in liabilities in 2013 - were: California Rep. David Valadao, Florida Reps. Alcee Hastings and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, California Reps. Buck McKeon and Dana Rohrabacher, Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II, Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley, New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, Pennsylvania Rep. Chaka Fattah and Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise.
