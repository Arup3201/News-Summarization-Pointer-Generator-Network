Most of us are guilty of doing our fair share of dodgy dancing at weddings and other boozy social events.

From the 'chicken wings' of the Birdie Song to the hand-flipping routine of the  Macarena - it seems you can't escape the awkward moves that take over the dancefloor towards the end of an evening.

But now 'the point, 'the hand fan, 'the 'fist 
pump' and the 'slide down' are all moves that are set to appear on a 
dancefloor near you as a new song Oh If I Catch You - which has become a chart sensation in Latin America and southern Europe - catches on here too.
