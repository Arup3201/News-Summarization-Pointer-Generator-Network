Ed Miliband was accused of ‘total cynicism’ last night after he made two sharply contrasting speeches on immigration and race equality in just seven hours. 

During a visit to Rochester on Thursday, where Ukip is tipped for a by-election victory next month on an anti-immigration platform, the Labour leader pledged to crack down on immigration if he wins power next year. 

But at a meeting with ethnic minority activists in Croydon, South London, a few hours later, he pledged a crackdown on race inequality and consider ‘all-black shortlists’ to recruit more ethnic Labour MPs. 

Contrast: Extracts from Ed Miliband's two speeches today portray a very different message from the Labour leader

In Rochester he made no mention of race equality; in Croydon he made no mention of curbing immigration. This comes just weeks after Ed was lampooned for forgetting to mention the budget deficit in his speech to the Labour conference. 

Last night, Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘No one will object to cracking down on racial inequality. But it is totally cynical to say one thing to one audience and something else a few hours later to another. 

The message should have been consistent.’ Mr Miliband used his trip to Rochester to unveil a tough new stance on immigration, saying: ‘If I become Prime Minister I will bring in clear, credible and concrete measures to count all people going in and out of the UK.’ 

He would stop child benefit and tax credits being paid for children who live abroad, curb immigrants’ benefits, ban bosses using immigrant labour to undercut British workers and make sure more public sector workers can speak English.’ 

But he did not mention immigration when he addressed the Black and Ethnic Minority Forum meeting in Croydon which included many Labour supporters. 

He said if he became PM, one of his first acts would be to introduce new laws to promote racial equality. 

Warning: The Labour leader was told he faces a ‘catastrophic’ blow to his hopes of power after the resignation of his Scottish counterpart Johann Lamont

‘I’m committing today, in front of you as my witnesses, to saying that if a Labour government is elected to power we will deliver a race equality strategy across every government department within a year. 

'We would tackle police stop and search, which is disproportionately used on black people... and tackle the under-representation of black people in the judiciary and in public sector board rooms.’ 

He said Labour wanted more ethnic minority Whitehall mandarins, judges and company directors and would ‘guarantee’ jobs for unemployed black youngsters in London. 

‘It is shocking that 44 per cent of black young people in London are without a job. We are going to guarantee them a job... You can hold me to that promise, after the General Election, unlike other politicians.’ 

Pressed by activists at the meeting to back ‘all-black shortlists’ to recruit more ethnic Labour MPs modelled on ‘all-women shortlists’, he said Labour ‘should debate the issue’. 

A Labour spokesman last night said it was ‘ridiculous’ to suggest Mr Miliband had been inconsistent.

The Labour leader was warned he faces a ‘catastrophic’ blow to his hopes of power after the resignation of his Scottish counterpart Johann Lamont. Henry McLeish, ex-Labour Scottish First Minister, said: ‘If there’s any hiccup in the number of MPs we send to Westminster in 2015, it could be catastrophic for Ed Miliband’s efforts to become Prime Minister.’ Ms Lamont quit yesterday, accusing Labour HQ of treating the Scottish party like a ‘branch office’. The move quickly led to calls for Gordon Brown to return to frontline politics and lead Scottish Labour.
