Two Ryanair cabin crew have been accused of trying to smuggle £6,000 of cigarettes into Britain in their luggage.

Gemma Phillips, 26, and Adam McEvatt, 
28, were stopped by customs at John Lennon Airport, 
Liverpool, following a flight from the Canary Islands.

They allegedly had 13,800 cigarettes in their baggage.

The legal amount holidaymakers can bring into the country is 200 cigarettes and 250 grams of rolling tobacco per person.

Phillips and McEvatt, both of Liverpool, were formally arrested the following day. They were charged with evading duty tax and have since been bailed to appear before magistrates in Manchester next month.

Ryanair said the staff were off-duty at the time of the alleged offences.

A spokesman for Border Force, the enforcement arm of the UK Border Agency, described the allegations as ‘serious’.

She said: ‘Two individuals travelling from the Canary Islands carrying excess cigarettes were stopped at Liverpool airport and arrested on suspicion of being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of excise duty.

‘They have since been charged and bailed to return to court on 17 September.

‘Tobacco smuggling is serious and increases the tax burden on everyone else. Revenue from cigarettes and tobacco helps fund public services.

‘Tobacco smugglers are tracked by Border Force and HMRC, and repeat offenders will be prosecuted.’

HM Revenue and Customs confirmed that
both were 'airline employees' and a border official source at the 
airport said all cabin crew are subject to the same entry procedures as 
passengers and ‘would not receive preferential treatment.’

A
Ryanair spokesman said: ‘As this alleged incident is the subject of a 
criminal investigation, we are not in a position to comment, other than 
to note that the individuals in question were off-duty at the time of 
these alleged offences.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
