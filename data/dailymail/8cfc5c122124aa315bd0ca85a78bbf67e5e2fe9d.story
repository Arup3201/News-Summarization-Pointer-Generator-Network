He is the billionaire bondage fanatic fanning the flames of lust in women across the globe.

A
large part of Christian Grey's allure no doubt comes from the fact that
readers are able to conjure up their very own fantasy figure as they 
read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy.

But
now, as plans for a Hollywood version of Fifty Shades get underway and 
casting begins for the man who will play the most sensational of roles,
thoughts have turned to just who will star as the magnetic mystery male.

He's the man: Vampire Diaries star Ian Somerhalder is the fans' choice to play Christian Grey in the movie adaptation of E.L. James's Fifty Shades of Grey

Rights to the raunchy best-seller - 
penned by Brit E. L. James - have been snapped up by Universal Pictures 
and the production team behind Oscar-winning film The Social Network.

The script is being finalised and filming is expected to start next year with intense speculation about which stars would land the coveted roles.

And it is Vampire Diaries star Ian 
Somerhalder who is the fans' choice to play Christian Grey in the big screen 
adaptation.

Almost one in six chose American
hunk Somerhalder - Damon Salvatore in the TV drama The Vampire Diaries -
to play the sado-masochistic billionaire in a poll by sex toy site lovehoney.co.uk.

In second place was Brit Henry Cavill, new star of the Superman movies, and Drive hunk Ryan Gosling came third.

Mad Men beauty Alexis Bledel has been chosen as the best actress to play his naive lover Anastasia Steele.

Texan beauty Alexis Bledel, 31, best 
known for playing adulteress Beth Dawes in Mad Men, just beat Anne 
Hathaway as the fans' choice to play Ana.

And fans are pleading with movie bosses not to tone down the sex in the bondage-filled flick.

Sex scenes are increasingly being 
written out of Hollywood movies because studios bosses say an adult-only
rating restricts a film's audience and box office potential.

The last film with a raunchy sex scene to top the box office was Titanic, way back in 1997.

But 90 per cent of those polled say it would be a big mistake to water down the sex in Fifty Shades.

Almost seven out of ten said the books were likely to be raunchier than the film and most fans believe the film will not be more popular than the books.

Fans were split down the middle over whether American or British stars should take the lead rolls - 50 per cent favouring each country.

A spokesman for Lovehoney said: 'This is the first time fans have been asked who they think should play Christian and Ana.

'It will be interesting to see if movie bosses agree with their choices.

'Fans have also said emphatically that they want all the sex kept IN the movie.

'There is huge excitement about the film but, if the fans are right, it will be a big mistake to make a Fifty Shades-lite version with the bondage left out. I am sure the final version will be amazing.'

Fifty Shades of Grey sold 70 million copies worldwide and Universal plan to make three movies from the trilogy of best-sellers.

Ian Somerhalder (15 per cent)Henry Cavill (13 per cent)Ryan Gosling (12 per cent)Michael Fassbender (11 per cent)Alexander Skarsgard (10 per cent)

Alexis Bedel (13 per cent)Anne Hathaway (12 per cent)Emma Stone (11 per cent)Mila Kunis (11 per cent)Elizabeth Olsen (10 per cent)
