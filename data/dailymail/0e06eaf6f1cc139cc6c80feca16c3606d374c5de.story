The housing market across the country looks set to slow down with property prices tempting more home buyers than ever before but it seems Sydney will continue to boom.

New data from Bendigo Bank/REIA Real Estate Market Facts Report revealed Sydney's median house price rose by 3.8 percent but prices remained unchanged for Melbourne.

Meanwhile, the other capital cities are becoming more affordable after eight consecutive quarters of growth, which should prove useful for first home buyers in particular to seek suitable residential or investment properties.

Darwin recorded a decrease at 1.7 percent to a median house price of $610,000 followed by Brisbane with the least drop out of the state capitals at 1 percent.

Executive Retail, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Dennis Bice said: 'The Australian weighted average median house price for the September quarter is now $620,900 or 0.7 percent higher when compared with the June quarter.

'The Australian weighted average median house price has been rising steadily since the September quarter of 2012, but with history to guide us, we know that markets move in cycles.

'This latest finding suggests that first-home buyers in particular may finally have a chance to build a deposit and enter the market before the next cycle begins.

'Recent improvements in the number of first home buyers in WA, ACT, Tasmania and Queensland give cause for some hope that this is one statistic we will finally see heading upward', Mr Bice concluded.
