Fears that the book Tintin in the Congo could warp young minds have led publishers to market it with protective packaging with warning labels similar to those on explicit top-shelf magazines

The new film may be good clean family fun, but one of Tintin’s classic adventures has been banished to the adult shelves of bookshops because it is overtly racist.

Fears that Tintin In The Congo could have a negative effect on children have led publishers  to market it in protective  packaging with warning labels similar to those on explicit magazines.

With a new generation of fans enjoying Steven Spielberg’s movie, The adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn, enthusiasm for collecting all 24 of Herge’s original comic books has never been higher.

Unfortunately, Tintin In The Congo was written in 1930 and depicts African natives as ignorant, simple and backward people, who are far less intelligent than their white visitors.

Leading booksellers such as Waterstones have taken the book out of the children’s section, fearing it ‘could get into the wrong hands’.

But critics claim that selling the book like a soft porn magazine is politically correct censorship, especially when children are regularly allowed to see graphic violence and sexually explicit material in the media.

The book, which was not published in English until 2005, shows the black population bowing down to the boy reporter after he smashes a diamond smuggling racket involving Al Capone.

The black people are depicted as stupid with thick lips. They end up worshipping Tintin and his faithful dog Snowy like gods.

Stereotype? One scene from the book depicts Tintin being carried in a bamboo chair to meet the King

Nick Seaton, secretary of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘As long as children understand times have changed it seems ridiculous to separate this book into the adult section.

‘Much of children’s literature is extremely graphic and sexually explicit these days and no one seems to bother about that.’

He added: ‘All these silly attempts at censorship do not do a lot of good. Bookshops have to be responsible about things like this but it can go too far and this is ridiculous.’

Publisher Egmont UK has put a protective band around the book with a warning about the content. Inside is an introduction by the original translators explaining the historical context.

Victory: The restrictions on Tintin in the Congo were in response to a complaint about the book by leading human rights lawyer David Enright. He is pictured here with his wife Gifty and children Finn, left and Tadg

The warning informs readers Herge’s portrayal of the Belgian Congo reflected ‘the colonial  attitudes of the time’ and the ‘stereotypes of the period’ which some people ‘may find offensive’.

The restrictions followed a complaint about the book by human rights lawyer David Enright.

He said: ‘It should be in the adult graphic novels section and even then some thought should be given to it.

‘There is no way of reading it without thinking it depicts black people as sub human and less mentally able than the apes. They all end up worshipping the dog.

‘I always enjoyed Tintin growing up and thought the books were excellent. Then I opened this one up and was shocked to say the least.’
