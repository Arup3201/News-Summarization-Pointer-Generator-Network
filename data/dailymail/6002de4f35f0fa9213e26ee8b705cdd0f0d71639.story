Tony Blair held secret talks with 
Colonel Gaddafi in the months before the release of the Lockerbie 
bomber,  letters and emails uncovered in war-torn Tripoli reveal.

After he stepped down as Prime Minister, Mr Blair was twice flown to Libya on a Gaddafi private jet.

He visited the dictator in June 2008 
and April 2009, when Libya was threatening to cut all business ties with
Britain if Abdelbaset al-Megrahi stayed in a Scottish jail. At one of 
his encounters, Mr Blair took a billionaire U.S. businessman with him. 
The Libyans wanted to discuss a beach resort deal.

The revelation of the meetings will 
provoke further claims that Mr Blair worked behind the scenes on behalf 
of the tyrannical regime to get the bomber released.

But despite admitting that Gaddafi 
brought up the issue of Megrahi, Mr Blair strenuously denied having 
anything to do with his release, saying it had always been solely a 
matter for the Scottish Executive.

Pam Dix, whose brother died in the 
1988 Lockerbie bombing, said: ‘The idea of Gaddafi paying for Mr Blair’s
visits is deeply offensive.

‘These new meetings are disturbing, 
and details of what was discussed should be made public. I am astonished
Tony Blair continued to have meetings like this out of office.’

The emails and letters, in which 
Gaddafi is referred to as ‘The Leader’, show that in 2008 and 2009, Mr 
Blair negotiated to fly to the Libyan capital from Sierra Leone, where 
he was promoting tourism, in a jet provided by Gaddafi.

One letter was written on June 2, 2008, by Gavin Mackay, from Mr Blair’s office, to Libya’s ambassador to the UK.

It said: ‘Let me begin my [sic] 
saying that Mr Blair is delighted that The Leader is likely to be able 
to see him during the afternoon of June 10, and he is most grateful that
the Libyan authorities have kindly offered an aircraft to take him from
Freetown to Tripoli and back to London.’

Libyan rebels have been forced into a chaotic retreat after failing in yet another attempt to storm the Gaddafi stronghold of Bani Walid.

Since taking the capital Tripoli last month, motley forces of the ruling National Transitional Council have met stiff resistance in Bani Walid and Gaddafi’s birthplace Sirte, which they must capture before they can declare Libya ‘liberated’.

Anti-Gaddafi fighters have tried several times to storm Bani Walid, 95 miles from Tripoli.

Yesterday’s failed attempt appeared to be among the worst yet, setting off recriminations among the attackers.

NTC fighters said they planned for tanks and trucks with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers to lead the assault, but foot soldiers piled in first.

‘There is a lack of organisation so far,’ said a senior fighter.

Meanwhile rebels and Nato warplanes attacked Sirte, Gaddafi’s birthplace. Civilian cars and pickup trucks poured out of the city, with residents describing water and electricity shortages amid street fighting.

Another letter shows that Mr Blair took billionaire Tim Collins to the April 2009 meeting.
Mr Blair’s events organiser Victoria Gould wrote to the British 
ambassador in Tripoli, Sir Vincent Fean, to ask whether the former PM 
could stay at his residence.

She wrote: ‘If we were able to stay at the Residence, I know TB [Mr Blair] would be really grateful (as would we all).’

Sir Vincent wrote back: ‘Just to confirm that the residence is at your disposal.’

A week later, Miss Gould wrote in an email: ‘We have asked the Libyans 
to collect us from Sierra Leone and bring us to Libya. In terms of 
calls, if you could note that TB would like to do the following: a 
meeting with The Leader (partly 1:1 and partly with Tim Collins).’

The meeting came a day after Britain 
signed an agreement with Libya which paved the way for Megrahi’s 
release. This happened in August 2009 after doctors gave him three 
months to live because of cancer. He is still alive.

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘The 
subjects of the conversations during Mr Blair’s occasional visits was 
primarily Africa, as Libya was for a time head of the African Union; but
also the Middle East and how Libya should reform and open up.

‘Of course the Libyans, as they 
always did, raised Megrahi. Mr Blair explained, as he always did, that 
it was not a decision for the UK Government but for the Scottish 
Executive.

‘As we have
made clear many times before, Tony Blair has never had any formal role,
paid or unpaid, with the Libyan Investment Authority or the Government 
of Libya and he has no commercial relationship with any Libyan company 
or entity.’

The former 
prime minister continues to have round-the-clock armed protection, and 
it is understood that Scotland Yard spent up to £20,000 during the trips
to Libya.
