Paul Scholes believes Wayne Rooney could retire from
football by the time he's 32 due to the amount of football's he's played in his
career.

Rooney made his professional debut in 2002 as a 16-year-old
for boyhood club Everton and Scholes thinks his former Manchester United
team-mate may hang up his boots in his early thirties due to the physical
demand of the game.

In his first column for Paddy Power, Scholes said: 'Wayne
might be a player who’d retire come 31 or 32, given the amount of football he’s
played.

'Wayne’s peak may have been a lot younger than what we’d
expect of footballers traditionally. Age 28 or 29 has been the normal
"peak". With Wayne, it could have been when he scored 27 league goals
in 2011-12 when he 26.

'He might be a player who’d retire come 31 or 32, given the
amount of football he’s played.

'Ryan Giggs has been on the go for ages, but he adjusted his
position. Can Wayne do the same? I don’t think Wayne will be able to play
centre forward until he’s 34 or 35.'

United have been craving a creative midfielder since
Scholes' retirement at the end of the 2012-13 season as the deposed Premier
League champions finished seventh at the end of this campaign.

The Red Devils have been heavily linked with a bid for
Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos but, under former Old Trafford boss David
Moyes, Rooney dropped back into this role on frequent occasions.

Scholes believes the England star could play in the middle of the park, saying: 'He could play centre midfield, possibly, into his
mid-thirties. He’s got all the ability to take over my old position at
Manchester United.

'He has played some games there, but has never gone on an
uninterrupted run. Whether he has the discipline to do it, right now I’m not
sure.'

Should Rooney retire by the age of 32, his last games could potentially be for England at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
