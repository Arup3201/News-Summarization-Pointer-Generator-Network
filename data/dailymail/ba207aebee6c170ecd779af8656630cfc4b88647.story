Lost amid Wayne Rooney’s struggle to define his role in Roy Hodgson’s team is the fact that many young England starlets have the chance to prove the manager can count on them in Brazil.

Luke Shaw is expected to start his first full international at left-back against Ecuador in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium, with Ross Barkley also in contention to start his first England game in midfield.

As Roy Hodgson prepares to experiment and try a few different options it could be one of the least experienced England team for many years, offset of course by Frank Lampard and Rooney, who have close to 200 caps between them.

One to watch: Ross Barkley will get his chance to impress for England against Ecuador in Miami

There is another chance to look at Raheem Sterling, to see James Milner in an unfamiliar position at right-back and for Ben Foster to start his first international for nearly four years.

After watching something like his first-choice team win 3-0 at home to Peru, this is the first big test for Hodgson’s admirable policy to take his young lions to Brazil.

Scratch the surface of the first team and suddenly England have a different profile, with central defenders Chris Smalling and Phil Jones, who do not always play at Manchester United, let alone in tandem in central defence.

Up front, Rickie Lambert, 32 years old and quite possibly still high after completing a transfer to his beloved Liverpool and yet still a World Cup rookie with only 110 minutes of competitive international football under his belt.

In midfield Jack Wilshere is expected to start as he continues his bid to prove his fitness over 90 minutes and challenge Jordan Henderson for a place alongside Steven Gerrard.

Breather: Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain will also start in England's midfield

Chance: Ben Foster will start between the posts for England while James Milner will play at right back

Can Wilshere stay fit? Is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, out for six weeks with a groin problem, ready for the rigours of a World Cup? Hodgson will probably learn far more from this experimental line-up in Florida than he did at Wembley against the Peruvians.

The England boss has tinkered, trying different personnel in different formations in tactical training sessions since the squad came together, including at times a diamond midfield and two up front, similar to the way Liverpool play, but on Tuesday in training at the Sun Life Stadium he used the 4-2-3-1 shape he has come to trust in the recent games.

The side he lined up - Foster; Milner, Smalling, Jones, Shaw; Lampard, Wilshere; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Barkley, Rooney; Lambert - has a total of just 303 caps, at an average of 27.5 each.

Take Lampard and Rooney out of the equation and the rest of the team has an average of 12.2 caps, the bulk of which will have been earned in non-competitive fixtures.

This fresh and youthful feel has so far been a boost for England, helping to banish the lingering bitterness of past failures and generate the positive energy which has been a feature of the camp during their first two and a half weeks together.

Out to impress: Raheem Sterling will hope to come off the bench and look good in front of Roy Hodgson

This game against Ecuador, however, is a genuine challenge. Do they have the talent and mental strength to get through in unfamiliar surroundings and in heat and humidity against opponents who are expected to be much stronger and more purposeful than Peru?

Ecuador finished above Uruguay in the South American qualifying group and 18-year-old Shaw will be up against their captain Antonio Valencia, of Manchester United.

Valencia did not look like the 70-cap star-man when he arrived at the Sun Life Stadium for training last night, helping the coaches to carry boxes of food into the dressing room.

Shaw, who made his England debut as a half-time substitute against Denmark in March, has played against many wingers of comparable quality in the Barclays Premier League this season but he cannot boast the experience of football in this climate, against a team used to playing in the heat.

So far, without fuss, he has passed every test thrown his way in a breakthrough season. Hodgson will hope to see his steady progress continue. Just as he will hope others prove his bold selection policy right in the Miami heat.
