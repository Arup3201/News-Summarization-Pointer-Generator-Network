A beautiful Mother's Day gesture for a San Diego cancer victim will now grant her three children the gift of her burial.

Renee Finney, 42, passed away on May 7 in her Moreno Valley home after being diagnosed the year before last.

Her children's agony was compounded by the fact her sudden passing left them unable to pay for her funeral - so on Mother's Day weekend they held a bake sale and car wash to try and raise the $10,000 they needed.

As part of that they wrote letters to their recently passed mom, tied them to balloons and left them fly away - in memory of Renee.

The letters told their mother how much they love her and asked why she had left so soon according to ABC 10.

One of the heartbreaking messages begins, 'Hi mom. I miss you and I hope you come and visit me soon because I have questions to ask like why you had to leave so soon.'

To their amazement, a kind-hearted good Samaritan, Yvette Melton discovered one of the balloons  30-miles away on her doorstep.

Melton was so touched by the letters that she started to do some research online using the names written in the letters.

She found Finney's obituary online and called the funeral home, which confirmed the family was in need of money for a proper burial.

Melton then told her boss, Jerry Halamuda of Fallbrook-based Color Spot Nurseries, about her discovery.

'The one part of the letter that really grabbed us was, 'we know you are up in heaven but we don't have any money to bury you' and so our thing was ... let's make this happen,' said Jerry Halamuda of Fallbrook-based Color Spot Nurseries.

Help:  Jerry Halamuda got his staff to help raise upwards of $12,000 for the Finney children

Within hours his employees had raised $2,000 and by Sunday 21 May, $12,648.

Because of the staggering generosity, $12,648 has been raised, meaning that Renee's funeral will now go ahead on May 23.

'I want to say thank you, I appreciate you, you are a godsend," said daughter Karries to ABC 10.

'My mom had no life insurance and you want to bury your mother the right way, you want to glorify your mother … it means everything to my family.'
