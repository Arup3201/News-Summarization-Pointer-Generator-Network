Between the choice of reading one of the sweariest cookbooks you're ever likely to read and 'no coffee, no alcohol, no dairy, no eggs, no sugar, no shellfish, no deep-water fish, no wheat, no meat, no soy and nothing processed at all' it seems the novice foodies of Britain have made up their minds.

Bad Cook, an eBook by journalist and intrepid amateur chef Esther Walker, was released yesterday and immediately raced ahead of Gwyneth Paltrow's It's All Good in the Amazon book charts.

The book is inspired by Esther's popular food blog, the Recipe Rifle, and is a blisteringly honest account of her endeavours in the kitchen

The book is inspired by Esther's popular food blog, Recipe Rifle, and is a blisteringly honest account of her endeavours in the kitchen.

It also includes tales of life as a mother to her two-year-old daughter Kitty and as a wife to restaurant critic Giles Coren.

Here, to celebrate the launch of her book Esther shares her top five tips for 'crap cooks' like her and a fail safe Salmon en Croute recipe to impress a date.

'You can either use a decent amount of salt in your cooking or you candie of a) starvation b) boredom'

1) Don't rush

Accept
that you are a bad cook and so when you ARE cooking, make sure you're 
not under any time pressure. Cooking in haste is a guaranteed way of 
really making a mess of things.

2) Try things out

It
can seem like a waste to make anything more complicated than pasta when
it's just you, but you have to try new recipes out or you'll never 
learn and get better - and using yourself as a guinea pig rather than, 
say a dinner party of 6, leaves you less open to panic, failure and 
embarrassment.

3) Don't assume that cooking is easy, because it isn't

Gwyneth's book has been trumped

At least, not for everyone. Although Jamie and Nigella and Nigel make knocking up dinner a joyous breeze on telly, it's not like that for the novice cook. So when attempting a recipe, follow it to the letter. Don't skip any steps, weigh everything properly, use the right-sized dishes and time everything religiously.

4) Keep it simple

If
you want to cook for a lot of people, don't be afraid to serve up 
something homely, like spaghetti bolognese or a fish pie.

Everybody will
love it. And having people over isn't just about dishing up impressive 
food - just make sure there is plenty to eat and drink and have a bunch 
of flowers somewhere and everyone will be delighted.

5) Salt is the key to cooking

An
extra pinch of salt can transform a dish from bland to delicious. So if
your curry is lacking a certain something, your pie seems uninspiring 
or your bolognese needs a boost, sprinkle over a large pinch of salt and
see if that makes a difference.

Intro taken from Recipe Rifle

'I had Salmon en Croute once at someone's house and it was absolutely disgusting.

'The cook had failed to use any salt, because they are the sort of person
who thinks that any salt kills you stone dead within weeks. My view is 
that you can either use a decent amount of salt in your cooking and run 
the extremely tiny risk of it doing you some damage, or you can use no 
salt and die of a) starvation b) boredom. And get some mean leg cramps 
in the night.

'But there's no reason why Salmon en Croute shouldn't be a delicious 
thing. It's wrapped in pastry! I mentally file this kind of thing under
my 'finishing school' category of cooking. Quiches and souffles are 
also filed under this category. Baked bone marrow and suet puddings are 
filed under 'New British, curries and stir-fries go under 'student', 
lemon meringue pie, soup, and devilled kidneys go under 'yuk' and so on.'

Salmon en Croute

Salmon en 
Croute is one of those things that 
seems very complicated but is in fact very easy. Sliced on the diagonal 
and served with a simple salad, it looks beautiful and will impress 
anyone. 

Salmon en Croute is one of those things that seems very complicated but is in fact very easy

Ingredients:

Serves 2

2 x salmon fillets. It 
is best to get these from a fishmonger, or at least the fish counter of a
supermarket because you need them with no skin on. You can skin them 
yourself, but it is tricky. 1 x packet of all-butter puff pastry1 egg, beatensalt and pepper1 small bunch dill, chopped - basil will also work here, if you don't like dill40g butter at room temperature1 tbsp wholegrain mustard

Method:

1 Put your oven on to 200C

2
Now make a paste out of the butter and dill. Put the butter in a small 
bowl with a pinch of salt and a few turns of the pepper grinder and then
mash in the dill with the back of a spoon. Set to one side.

3 
Take your salmon fillets and have a look at how they would fit together,
like a Yin Yang sign - this is how you are going to sandwich them 
together before wrapping them in the pastry. Then spread one side of 
your salmon sandwich with the herb butter and the other side with the 
wholegrain mustard, then fit together and set to one side.

4 Put a baking tray in the oven to get nice and hot (this will help prevent a soggy bottom...)

5
Roll out the puff pastry until it is about the thickness of a pound 
coin (have a look at an actual pound coin, because this is thinner than 
you think it is). Now place your salmon in the middle and bring the 
pastry up and over it to form a neat parcel. Trim the ends so there 
isn't too much of an overlap and tuck it all in, like a present. Seal 
all the edges with some beaten egg to help it stick. (If you don't have a
pastry brush to distribute the egg, you can just use a finger.)

6
Turn the salmon over, so that the seam is on the underside. Make three 
slits in the top of your parcel to let steam escape and brush all over 
with beaten egg (I also sprinkle some sea salt and pepper over the top 
for decoration).

7 Now take your hot baking tray out of the oven 
and brush with a little bit of oil to stop the salmon en croute from 
sticking. You can use a folded square of kitchen towel for this. Lay 
your pastry parcel on the baking tray and bake for 35 mins.

Produce to gasps of awe from your date.
