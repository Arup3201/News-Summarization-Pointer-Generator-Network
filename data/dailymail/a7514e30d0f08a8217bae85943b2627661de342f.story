He was the graffiti artist turned darling of the art world whose fans included Andy Warhol and Madonna before his death following an overdose in 1988 cut a promising career tragically short.

But while Jean-Michel Basquiat is gone, his work lives on. Now prints of 35 of his most famous works are to go on sale in Selfridges for the first time.

The collection, which starts at £90, even includes some of the Basquiat works that remain in private hands and haven't been seen since his death.

Striking though the pieces, which have been created in collaboration with Easyart, are, it's the artist's own tale that remains the most eye-catching part of the story.

Born in a grotty part of Brooklyn, Basquiat's love of art was sparked by regular childhood trips to New York art galleries in the company of his mother, Matilda.

But when she was committed to a mental institution when Basquiat was 11, his world fell apart and by the age of 15, the fledgling artist had run away from home and was supporting himself by making homemade t-shirts.

Despite all the hardships, Basquiat's talent for art remained and by 1976, he was beginning to make a name for himself as part of the SAMO art collective with his friend Al Diaz.

Once firmly embedded in the predominantly white, New York art world, Basquiat collaborated with Andy Warhol and Keith Haring, and briefly dated a young Madonna, who described him as one of the few people she 'was truly envious of'.

But he never was entirely able to escape his demons and by the mid 1980s, was regularly using drugs, including heroin.

And when his close friend and collaborator Andy Warhol died in 1987, it sent Basquiat into a tailspin, worsening his drug addiction in the process.

Just over a year after Warhol died, Basquiat too was dead - of a heroin overdose taken in his New York studio. He was just 27 years old.

Despite Basquiat's untimely death, his reputation has continued to grow with the artist dominating contemporary art sales.

Last year, sales of his paintings totalled £126m, while contemporary fans include Leonardo DiCaprio, Nicki Minaj, ASAP Rocky and Frank Ocean.

Another A-list fan, Jay-Z, has rapped about him and reportedly paid $4.5 million for Mecca at Sotheby’s last year.

Speaking about the new prints, Easyart's Gyr King said: 'We’re delighted that anyone unfamiliar with Basquiat’s brilliance, or who has ever wanted one of his enigmatic works in their home, will now be able to, through our partnership with Selfridges, or by purchasing from Easyart.com.'
