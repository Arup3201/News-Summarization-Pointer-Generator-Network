The police chief at the center of the scandal that erupted after an officer shot teenager Michael Brown dead insists he will not be stepping down.

Thomas Jackson has said he is staying put despite calls for him to quit and months of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of the 18-year-old. 

He says that he wants to 'see it [the scandal]' through and believes he has the support of the police and the community. 

The storm began when Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot the African American teen on August 9.

Defiant: Thomas Jackson (left) has said he is staying put despite calls for him to quit and months of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August 

His death was followed by months of riots in the city along with calls from the community for the police to be held accountable. 

According to officials, the plan was to oust Jackson  as a result of the scandal, but they hoped he may have left of his own accord.

But told CNN: 'I'm going to stay and see this through.'  

Jackson added: 'I certainly have the support of the police department and the community. I have a lot of support in the community. I think this is my job to complete, and I'm going to do it.'

This week the force stocked up on riot gear ahead of the grand jury decision over whether Wilson will be charged for Brown's death.

More than $170,000 worth of equipment has been taken in to help take the unrest expected in the wake of the decision. 

As well as accusations local police were racially profiling black members of the community, concerns were raised about the force's military-style response to the disorder. 

This included spending on 650 teargas grenades, 1,500 beanbag rounds and 6,000 pepper balls.

Further spending was also made on 235 riot gear helmets, 135 shields, 25 batons and 60 sets of shin guards. 

A Grand Jury is set to decide whether Officer Darren Wilson (left) will be charged over the death of the youngster. Police have brought in more riot gear to prepare for further unrest 

In a sit-down interview with CNN late last month, Jackson apologized for the way his department handled the Brown incident and its aftermath, with police clashing with protesters.

However he maintained he would not be stepping down.

'I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,' Jackson said on September 29.

'Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through.

'This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it.' 

Continuing conflict: The youngster's death was followed by months of clashes with police in Missouri - some of them turning violent 

Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting, which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics.

Grand jury proceedings are secret, but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilson's testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged.

The decision could be made public within the next month.

In the meantime, law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick, widespread arrests.

Expected disorder: Law enforcement will receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement

They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready, but have been meeting with clergy, community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets.

Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement.

That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare.
