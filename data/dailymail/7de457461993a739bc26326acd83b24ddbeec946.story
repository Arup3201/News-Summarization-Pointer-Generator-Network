People decide how trustworthy strangers are within the blink of an eye, psychologists have found, and it is all down to their facial features.

We tend to judge someone with high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones to be more honest, while we are less likely to trust someone with a furrowed brow and sunken cheeks, researchers at New York University suggest.

The findings give new weight to the principle that first impressions count - even if all it's down to genetics.

Psychologists at the university found that a section of the brain decides a person’s trustworthiness even before we have consciously perceived who they are.

There is no evidence, however, that facial features demonstrate how honest someone really is – simply that they may be perceived to be trustworthy or untrustworthy depending on their looks.

The brain takes just 33 milliseconds - three hundredths of a second, or a tenth of a time it takes to blink - to decide whether someone is to be trusted.

The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggests that our brains are set up to be instantly wary of people we decided we should not trust.

Jonathan Freeman, assistant professor at New York University’s Department of Psychology, said in a release: ‘Our findings suggest that the brain automatically responds to a face’s trustworthiness before it is even consciously perceived.

‘The results are consistent with an extensive body of research suggesting that we form spontaneous judgments of other people that can be largely outside awareness.’

Applying the findings to public figures, comedian and talk show host Jimmy Fallon and entertainment news journalist Maria Menounos indeed have high cheekbones and eyebrows.

Study: Researchers presented these real and computer-generated faces so subjects could evaluate their 'trustworthiness.'

Conversely, public figures who have been roundly condemned for their dishonesty or behavior – including convicted killer Scott Peterson and former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling  – have sunken cheeks and furrowed brows.

The New York research team presented a panel of ten volunteers with 300 computer generated faces, and asked them how trustworthy each was.

Those faces with high cheekbones, high eyebrows and a smile were perceived to be the most honest.

The scientists also presented the panel with real pictures of strangers, and the same facial attributes were found to be deemed as trustworthy.

In a second set of experiments, a new set of 37 volunteers were presented with the ‘trustworthy’ and ‘untrustworthy’ images for a split second, while their brain activity was monitored.

The images were then immediately replaced with a neutral picture so the brain could no longer process the previous image.

The scientists found that a region of the brain called the amygdala, which is vital in social and emotional behavior, activated within 33 milliseconds even when the images were flashed up just momentarily.

Faces with the high eyebrows and prominent cheekbones prompted activity in a different part of the amygdala than faces with furrowed brows and sunken cheeks.

Dr Freeman said: ‘The findings suggest that we can assess another person’s trustworthiness from their face extremely rapidly and without conscious awareness, and that the amygdala plays an important role in this process.

‘One possibility is that faces that appear more untrustworthy and likely to inflict harm, or faces with stronger trustworthiness cues in general, are spontaneously tracked by the amygdala, so the amygdala could then quickly alter other brain processes and coordinate fast, appropriate responses to people --- approach or avoid.

‘This tracking would be especially pronounced for untrustworthy faces, who might inflict harm, which is consistent with what we found.’

Dr Bessam Farjo, a British cosmetic surgeon who specializes in hair transplants, including eyebrows, said: ‘The study’s findings are fascinating and further emphasizes that we do make first assumptions which are not necessarily based on our experiences or what information we have been exposed to.'
