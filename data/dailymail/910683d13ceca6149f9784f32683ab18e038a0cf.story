The remains of an 18-year-old girl who went missing after hitchhiking in December have been found in a remote park in Colorado.

Kelly Mae Myers was reported missing on December 18 by distraught relatives in Colorado who said her disappearance was 'out of character'.

Police are investigating the death as suspicious after discovering the remains in Cactus Park, Mesa County - a hotspot for four-wheel truck drivers performing stunts.

Tragic: The remains of Kelly Mae Myers, 18, were found in a remote desert park of Colorado on Saturday

On Saturday, the Sheriff's Office posted on Facebook: 'Kelly Mae Myers...it is with deep sympathy we notify our community that her remains were recovered in a remote Mesa County area, yesterday. 

'This death investigation is active and on-going, so please be patient as many details are not yet available for release. 

'We hope the community will surround her family and friends, and support them in their time of grief.'

An autopsy was conducted on Sunday. That results have yet to be released. 

Search: She had been missing since December 18 when family thought she had hitchhiked to friends in Utah

A search team was not sent out for Myers until January 19 as authorities suggested she appeared to have fled independently to meet friends in Salt Lake City, Utah.

In an appeal that day, the sheriff's office said: 'A few reports to investigators have indicated Kelly might have hitch hiked to Utah.

'Investigators believe she has friends or known associates in the Salt Lake City area, and may have been trying to get there.

'Currently, investigators do not have any information she in endangered, however, her family insists this is very unusual behavior for Kelly and a great cause for concern.'

According to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel, Myers worked at Abra Formal Wear and attended Central High School.

A friend commented on her Facebook page: 'With a heavy heart I have to inform all my family and friends that they have found our sweet Kelly. Thank you to all who shared her information while she was missing. I only wish she had been found alive and well. We love you Kell Smell and I hope you sleep with the Angels and find peace.'
