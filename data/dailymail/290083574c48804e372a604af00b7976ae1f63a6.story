No joke: Naguib Sawiris apologised for the cartoons of Mickey and Minnie Mouse which angered Muslims

A cartoon of Mickey Mouse with a beard and Minnie Mouse wearing the niqab face veil has angered hard-line Muslims.

The pictures were posted online by an Egyptian Christian businessman to advertise his mobile phone firm.

The ultra-conservative Muslims, known as Salafis, called the cartoon posted by media mogul and politician Naguib Sawiris 'a mockery of Islam'.

The Salafis have since launched campaigns on Facebook and Twitter calling on Muslims to boycott Mr Sawiris's mobile phone company Mobinil.

The cartoons are another source of 
sectarian tensions in Egypt, which have already seen widespread violence
during a period of political transition.

Shares in Mobinil and Orascom Telecom, both companies owned by Mr Sawiris, fell on the Egyptian stock exchange.

Sawiris is founder of the liberal Free Egyptians Party which believes in a secular Egypt.

He
owns several media companies and after Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak
was ousted in February, his party called for 
the separation of state and religion.

After the cartoon was posted online, it immediately caused a flurry of complaints on Twitter.

Mr Sawiris then tweeted: 'I apologise for those who don't take this as a joke; I just 
thought it was a funny picture; no disrespect meant. I am sorry.'

Several Facebook groups calling for a boycott of his mobile phone company have appeared and now have around 60,000 followers.

The
group, called 'We are joking Sawiris', said: 'If you are really a 
Muslim, and you love your religion, boycott his projects. We have to cut
out the tongue of any person who attacks our religion.'

At
least 15 Salafi lawyers have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Sawiris of 
religious contempt, an official at the prosecutor's office said.

Another Facebook group named 'We hate you Mickey Sawiris' depicted the Egyptian businessman as Mickey Mouse. The group's motto is: 'No to mockery of Islam.'

A Salafi cleric Mazen el-Sersawi appeared on television to criticise Mr Sawiris.

Mockery: Mickey Mouse was depicted with a beard and Minnie Mouse had a face veil in the Egyptian mobile phone advert

He said: 'How can a man like this make fun of Muslims, in a country on the brink of sectarian discord?

'If this is just joking, why don't you depict Mickey Mouse as a monk or a nun?'

It is not the first time Mr Sawiris has provoked criticism with comments about Islam. In 2007, he spoke out against the Islamic veil.

He told a newspaper: 'I am not against veil... but when I walk in the street, I feel like a foreigner.'

Mr Sawiris posted his drawings around the time that a
Danish court sentenced a Somali man to ten years in prison for breaking
into the home of a Danish cartoonist who caricatured the Prophet 
Muhammad, armed with an axe.

Muhideen Mohammed Geelle, 30, was found guilty of a terror attempt.

Geelle entered cartoonist Kurt Westergaard's home in Aarhus on New Year's Day 2010.

Mr Westergaard locked himself inside a panic room and was unharmed.

Police arrived and apprehended Geelle after shooting him in the leg.

Danish authorities said they have 
foiled several terror plots linked to the 2005 newspaper cartoons of the
Prophet Muhammad that triggered protests in Muslim countries.

Salafism is an extremely conservative branch of Islam.

Saudi Arabia's puritanical Wahhabi interpretation is considered its forerunner, and Saudi preachers on TV and the Internet have been key to the spread of Salifism in Egypt.

Salafists are distinguished by the way they dress. In many parts of Cairo, women wear the niqab -Â  a veil which reveals only the eyes.

Male followers often have long beards and shave off their moustaches, a style said to imitate the Prophet Muhammad.

Political commentators are worried that the controversial cartoons could spark further violence on Egyptian streets ahead of crucial parliamentary elections in September.
