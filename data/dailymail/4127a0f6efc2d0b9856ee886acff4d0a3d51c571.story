Condemned: Joseph Wood's execution by lethal injection was halted after a court ruled this week he had a right to know the drugs that will be used to end his life

A U.S. appeals court has ordered the execution of an Arizona man condemned for killing his ex-girlfriend and her father in to be put on hold until the state discloses which lethal injection drugs it will use.

Joseph Wood, 55, was scheduled to be put to death Wednesday, but the court ruled he was entitled to know more about the drugs that will be used to execute him and who will be administering them.

The three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling effectively postponed Wood's death for the foreseeable future as the state scrambles to find an acceptable lethal injection method amid drug shortages and controversies around the U.S.

Wood raised serious questions about whether his constitutional rights were being violated, and it said the inmate could suffer 'irreparable harm' if his demands were not met, the court ruled in a 2-1 decision.

'Since Wood's execution would likely not be delayed much, if at all, by giving him the information he seeks, the public interest factor weighs in Wood's favor,' said Judge Sidney Thomas, writing for the majority.

Wood's attorney, Dale Baich, said in a statement that the decision underlined the public's right to know in the debate over capital punishment in Arizona and beyond.

'The court said it's important that 
specific and detailed information be provided so the public can know 
about how safely and reliably the death penalty is administered,' Baich 
explained.

A spokeswoman for Arizona's attorney general said the state would ask the full appeals court to reconsider.

Wood was convicted in 1991 of walking into an automobile body shop in Tucson and shooting his former girlfriend, Debbie Dietz, 29, to death after fatally shooting her father, Gene Dietz, 55.

Saturday's ruling, which reverses a lower-court decision, requires the state to provide death row inmates with information on the drugs that will be used to kill them, as well as details about the medical personnel who will be involved.

Wood is one of six death row inmates who sued Arizona last month arguing that secrecy surrounding lethal-injection drugs used in botched executions in Ohio and Oklahoma violates their constitutional rights.

The most infamous incident happened in April, when a faulty drug combination caused Oklahoma inmate Clayton Lockett, 38, died of a heart attack 40 minutes after a botched injection.
