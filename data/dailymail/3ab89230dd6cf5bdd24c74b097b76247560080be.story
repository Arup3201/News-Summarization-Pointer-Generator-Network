Half of drivers ignore speed limits on Britain’s motorways and town centre roads, shocking new figures show.

Last year 47 per cent of cars travelled faster than the 70mph limit on motorways, but the government has ruled out doing anything about it.

Motoring groups said the ‘default limit’ was now 80mph, because drivers know they will avoid prosecution.

Most drivers think they will not be fined if they break the 70mph limit on motorways, driving groups claimed

Official data from the Department for Transport reveals the scale of law breaking on the nation’s roads.

In 2013, 47 per cent of cars, 46 per cent of motorbikes and 48 per cent of vans broke the 70mph limit in free-flowing traffic.

It also shows that in built up areas where the limit is 30mph, drivers are just as willing to speed.

There are fears that the reluctance of police forces to stop people speeding on motorways could be encouraging drivers to think they will escape a ticket in residential roads, where speeding is more dangerous.

The government has announced plans to increase the speed limit for HGVs on single carriageway roads from 40mph to 50mph. It follows data showing that 73 per cent of lorries breaks the current limit.

Transport minister Baroness Kramer said: ‘There are a variety of reasons why it is appropriate to change the national HGV speed limits on single and dual carriageways.

‘One is that the low level of compliance with them is symptomatic of their being set at the wrong level compared to other limits.

‘So on single carriageways the non-compliance level for cars is 7 per cent and buses and coaches 26 per cent, compared to 73 per cent for articulated lorries.’

However, the government insists it is not reviewing national speed limits for other types of vehicles.

The last Transport Secretary Philip Hammond announced plans to raise the motorway limit to 80mph.

But the proposals have been shelved by his replacement, Patrick McLoughlin, with officials saying it is not a priority.

There are fears that the 'flexibility' in motorway limits encourages people to break the law in built up areas where the speed limit is 30mph

Edmund King, President of the AA, said: ‘In decent weather in a modern car at a good distance from the care in front, 80mph is probably a safe speed.

‘But 50mph in an old car, on a pot-holed motorway, too close to the car in front is probably too fast.’

He said the ‘default speed limit’ on motorways is now 80mph. ‘One is rarely if ever stopped by the police and prosecuted between 80 and 80mph.

AA President Edmund King warned drivers now think they can get away with speeding

‘Therefore it is almost accepted as the common law speed limit. That’s why half of drivers tend to break it.’

But Mr King warned the flouting of the law on motorways risked creating a precedent in built-up areas, where ignoring the 30mph limit could become the norm.

‘If drivers are of the opinion that there is some flexibility around speed limits the danger is that when it comes to lower speed limits, which are much more crucial in road safety, we don’t want drivers to have that same flexibility.

‘Driving at 40mph in a 30mph area is incredibly dangerous.’

He called for variable limits for different times of the day. ‘In the UK we don’t trend to treat our drivers as intelligent.

‘There is probably a good case in some of our urban areas for a different limit during the day time when more people are around and in the middle of the night when no-one is around.’

Labour’s shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: ‘Road safety and law enforcement should be a top priority for any Government. Sadly, more than 10,000 frontline traffic police posts have gone since 2010.

‘Instead of increasing HGV speed limits, ministers need to take concrete steps to make our roads safe for all users, particularly children, older people and cyclists.’

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Most drivers know that keeping to the speed limit can mean the difference between life and death in a collision, regardless of the road type.

‘We want people to drive safely at all times, which is we recently increased the fixed penalty to £100 for several driving offences, including careless driving, and why we have given local councils more flexibility to implement 20mph limits and zones.’
