A judge has dropped shoplifting charges against a teenage mother caught carrying her dead baby in a shopping bag at Victoria's Secret.

Tiona Rodriguez, then 17, was stopped on suspicion of stealing a $45 pair of trousers at the store in Herald Square, New York, in October last year.

Police said security guards searched the girl's bags and found the remains of her infant son wrapped in a plastic bag and covered in clothes.

Prosecutors conceded yesterday that time had run out to try the misdemeanor theft case.

But the Manhattan District Attorney's office is still trying to decide whether to  charge Rodriguez, now 18, in the death of her baby. 

Her attorney, Earl Ward, is hopeful there will not be further prosecution, saying it has been more than a year since she was arrested.

'I think that's a very positive sign. I have always said it's not a case of homicide, that it's the case of a baby that was stillborn,' Mr Ward said.

The baby boy's death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner in April and officials said the infant was less than a day old when he died of asphyxia.

Ms Rodriguez, who has a two-year-old son, told police she had a miscarriage the day before and had put the remains in her bag because she didn't know what to do.

The young mother was released without bail after she pleaded not 
guilty to petty larceny and possession of stolen property charges.

At the time, authorities said they couldn't bring charges over the dead
 baby until forensic tests determined exactly how the full-term newborn 
died.

Preliminary
 reports from detectives suggested the foetus was born alive and may have been asphyxiated.  

Police
 believe Rodriguez gave birth in her friend Francis Estevez's home shortly before the shoplifting arrest. 

The 
investigators spent two hours going through an upstairs apartment where 
Estevez's family lives.

The friends were arrested on October 17 in a 
Victoria's Secret shop on 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan.

The grisly discovery was made when the two girls were stopped by a 
security guard as they left the store in Herald Square on suspicion of 
shoplifting.
