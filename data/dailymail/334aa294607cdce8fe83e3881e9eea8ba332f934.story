In the first case of its kind, a New York appeals court has rejected an animal rights advocate's bid to extend 'legal personhood' to chimpanzees, saying the primates are incapable of bearing the responsibilities that come with having legal rights.

The unanimous ruling meant that Tommy, a 26-year-old chimpanzee is not entitled to the rights of a human and does not have to be freed by its owner

A five-judge panel of the Albany court on Thursday said attorney Steven Wise had shown that Tommy,  who lives alone in a shed in upstate New York, was an autonomous creature, but that it was not possible for him to understand the social contract that binds humans together.

'So far as legal theory is concerned, a person is any being whom the law regards as capable of rights and duties,' Presiding Justice Karen Peters wrote.

'Needless to say, unlike human beings, chimpanzees cannot bear any legal duties, submit to societal responsibilities or be held legally accountable for their actions,'

That, they ruled, makes it 'inappropriate' to grant the rights of a human to the animal. 

Wise, representing The Nonhuman Rights Project, which he helped found in 2007, was seeking a ruling that Tommy had been unlawfully imprisoned by his owner, Patrick Lavery. Wise argued that the chimp should be released to a sanctuary in Florida.

According to Wise and other experts, it is the first case anywhere in the world in which an appeals court has been asked to extend human rights to animals.  

There was no initial response to an email sent to Wise with a question about the possibility of a further appeal to the state's top court.

Tommy's owner, Patrick Lavery, said Thursday he was pleased and expected the ruling.

'I just couldn't picture any court granting habeas corpus for an animal,' he said. 'If it works for one animal, it works for all animals. It would open a can of worms.'

Decision: Presiding Justice Karen Peters of the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division Third Department poses a question to Attorney Steven Wise of the Nonhuman Rights Project during arguments at the court

Attorney Steven Wise of the Nonhuman Rights Project talks to reporters after arguing on behalf of Tommy, a chimpanzee, at the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division. The court ruled against Tommy.

Tommy is a former entertainment chimp who was placed with Lavery about 10 years ago.

Lavery said Tommy is cared for under strict state and federal license rules and inspections.

The court noted there have been no claims that Tommy has been mistreated or any of those rules have been violated.

Lavery said Tommy lives in a seven-room enclosure in Gloversville with lots of toys and other 'enrichment.'

Wise was not immediately available to comment. He has said that if he lost Tommy's case, he would ask for it to be heard by the Court of Appeals, New York's top state court.

Lavery said in an interview that he agreed with the judges. Tommy, he said, received state-of-the-art care and was on a waiting list to be taken in by a sanctuary.

'It will be my decision where he goes, and not someone else's,' he said.

Peters wrote for the court that while chimps could not be granted legal rights, Wise could lobby the state legislature to create new protections for chimps and other intelligent animals.

The decision, which upheld a 2013 ruling by a state judge, came after Wise on Tuesday urged a separate court in Rochester to order the release of a deaf chimp named Kiko from a cement cage at his owner's home in Niagara Falls.

Wise has also filed a third case on behalf of two chimps that live at a state university on Long Island.
