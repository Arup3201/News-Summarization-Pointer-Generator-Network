Samantha Cameron is famous for her love of Scandinavian minimalist style and it seems she's also a fan of IKEA furniture and Danish butter. The Prime Minister's wife was hosting a breakfast for disabled children at Downing Street and served up crumpets  with a £6.20 1kg tub of Lurpak spread.

The feast, which saw Stevie Tyrie, who has cerebral palsy, and Down's Syndrome sufferer Philip Kiley, take their places around the £795 marble table by A Modern World, also featured a bumper 500g pot of Marmite (£3.95) and a jar of Tiptree jam.

Behind the children was the Cameron's £25,000 kitchen, which boasts some stylish new pieces that have been added since the doors to the Camerons' flat at No.11 were last thrown open during Angela Merkel's visit in February last year.

What's in Sam's kitchen? The Prime Minister's wife has a family room crammed with luxury homeware - and a couple of bargains

Big breakfast: Samantha Cameron welcomed two disabled children and their families to Downing Street for breakfast this morning

While some bits, among them the Jamie Oliver stainless steel saucepans stacked on a shelf beside the range and the £665 Oka bookshelf remain the same, an eye-catching new lamp and a series of hand-drawn pictures were visible.

The aluminium lamp, a £1,615 Flos Arco floor lamp, could be seen bending down towards the breakfast table, its white Carrara marble base clearly visible beside a considerably cheaper £250 Hemnes black wooden dresser from Swedish furniture suppliers, IKEA.

The toast and crumpets were washed down with orange juice and coffee served in black ceramic Barista Latte mugs by Whittards, which are currently reduced from £8 to £3.

Lining the Oka shelves visible next to the Camerons' £799 hood cooker by Sigma were saucepans from the Jamie Oliver cookware range, which starts at £43, and a cheaper set from John Lewis which comes with a starting price of £30.

Finishing off the Camerons' £25,000 Roundhouse kitchen is a £60 clock from Habitat which can just be seen peeking out from beside the Prime Minister's brushed steel fridge.

Chic: Behind them could be seen the Camerons' new £1,615 Flos Arco floor lamp while breakfast was eaten from a £785 marble table 

Cheap chic: Not everything was expensive. Mrs Cameron's glass-fronted cabinet is a £250 flat Pack affair by IKEA 

Drink up! Coffee was served in £8 (now reduced to £3) black ceramic barista mugs by Whittards alongside crumpets and croissants

Tasty: Also on the table was a bumper tub of butter by Danish brand Lurpak, a 500g jar of Marmite and jam by Tiptree 

Dark walnut flooring by Swedish flooring specialist Kährs, which costs £75 per square metre and is handcrafted in one of the oldest flooring factories in the world, can be seen underneath.

The Camerons' Oka bookcase is as well stocked as the kitchen shelves, with an eclectic mix of titles just visible. Among them are high end foodie tomes such as The Ginger Pig Meat Book and River Cottage Every Day, as well as political reads such as Jeremy Paxman's On Royalty. 

Both the Prime Minister and Mrs Cameron appear to be fans of a box set with Star Wars, a Desperate Housewives,  Brideshead Revisited, Band of Brothers, Michael McIntyre Live and Kill Bill among the DVDs on their shelves.

Although the Camerons benefit from an £30,000 grant awarded to maintain the No.11 flat, any extras, including the £25,000 kitchen, are paid for out of their own pockets.

Mrs Cameron was hosting the breakfast in support of the charity, Contact A Family, which offers support and advice to families with children who suffer from disabilities such as cerebral palsy.

She is patron of the charity and has her own experiences of raising a disabled child to draw on. Tragically, the Camerons' 'beautiful boy' Ivan, who suffered from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, unexpectedly passed away in February 2009. 

'Contact A Family’s exhibition is a fantastic way to highlight the joys and challenges of raising a disabled child,' said Mrs Cameron, speaking during the breakfast at No.10.

'I am delighted to support such a positive initiative and also to welcome Stevie, Philip and their families to Downing Street for breakfast and to hear how Contact A Family makes such a difference to their lives.' 

Not the first time:The £1,151 'Fancy Nancy' sofa was the scene of high level talks between Cameron and Chancellor Merkel in February 2014
