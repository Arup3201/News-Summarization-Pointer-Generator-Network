A Texas man repeatedly groped a female passenger on a New York City-bound flight while she tried to sleep next to him, federal authorities charge.

Pratik Rakesh Doshi, a self-employed medical technician, was charged in Brooklyn Federal Court with abusive sexual contact stemming from the incident aboard an American Airlines flight, court records show.

The victim said she had been sleeping on her tray table, flying somewhere between Dallas and New York City's Kennedy Airport, when she was roused by a repeated bumping and brushing against her torso and left leg.

She at first thought the man next to her, later identified as Doshi, had bumped into her by mistake, so she pretended to still be asleep. She had taken a Valium hours earlier but told authorities she was no longer groggy.

But then the touching became even more brazen: Doshi 'slid his hand under the passenger's shirt' and 'began rubbing and squeezing her left breast,' court records show.

'Let's go to the bathroom,' he whispered, according to the files.

The woman, whose daughter was sitting next to her, continued to pretend she was asleep.

He tried to spread the woman's legs apart using his feet and 'attempted to put his hand inside the passenger's pants,' court records show.

Doshi, who had moved from a seat several rows back to sit next to the victim, 'began to rub his hand between the passenger's legs on the outside of her pants,' the files show.

Fed up, the woman woke her daughter up and told a flight attendant. The victim and her daughter were moved to a different seat toward the back of the plane and remained there for the duration of the flight.

When questioned after the flight, Doshi told authorities that he only had 'casual contact' with the woman, nothing beyond 'what would be typical for two people seated next to each other on an airplane,' court records show.

He was arrested in Los Angeles on July 30 after he returned from a flight to India.

His case file was unsealed this week in Brooklyn Federal Court, where he posted $40,000 bail.
