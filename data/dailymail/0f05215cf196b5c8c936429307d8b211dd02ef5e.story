A pioneering fashion photographer who laced his images with surrealist humour and shot more than 90 Vogue covers in his career, Horst P. Horst is now the subject of a huge retrospective at the V&A.

One of the 20th century’s master photographers, German-born Horst (1906-99) was famed for capturing the grace and glamour of haute couture in a career spanning six decades.

Horst, real name Horst Paul Albert Bohrmann, was born in Weißenfels-an-der-Saale but worked predominantly in Paris and New York.

One of his most famous images, and one 
of the most iconic photos of the 20th Century, is The Mainbocher Corset -
 seen below - taken in Vogue’s Paris studio in 1939.

Designer Donna Karan notable cites the timeless beauty of the image as inspiration for her collections today.

Celebrating the life and work of the artist, the definitive retrospective will feature exquisite images he took of Chanel, 
Schiaparelli and Vionnet collections in 1930s Paris.

Iconic: This photo, the Mainbocher Corset, was taken in 1939 and is one of the 20th Century's most iconic shots

Horst's influence is evident in the work of performers including Herb Ritts, Bruce Weber and Madonna

In
 New York a decade later, he experimented with early colour techniques 
and his meticulously composed, artfully-lit images leapt from the 
magazine page.

The exhibition will display Horst’s best known photographs alongside unpublished and rarely exhibited vintage prints.

The
 250-strong collection conveys the diversity of his output, from 
surreal, still-life images to portraits of Hollywood stars, nudes, nature 
studies and documentary pictures of the Middle East.

Original
 contact sheets, sketches and archive film footage will feature 
alongside his stunning pictures to examine his unique creative process.

Martin Roth, Director of the V&A said: 'Horst was one of the greatest photographers of fashion and society and produced some of the most famous and evocative images of the 20th century.

'This exhibition will shine a light on all aspects of his long and distinguished career.

'Horst’s legacy and influence, which 
has been seen in work by artists, designers and performers including 
Herb Ritts, Robert Mapplethorpe, Bruce Weber and Madonna, continues 
today.'
