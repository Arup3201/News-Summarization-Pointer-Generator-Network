Simon Burgess of Bristol University said White British students may benefit from larger numbers of students from ethnic minorities 

Cities with large numbers of immigrant children produce better GCSE results than the rest of the country because pupils work harder, a study found today.

White British pupils make slower progress than pupils from ethnic minorities who tend to be more ambitious and committed to education, according to researchers.

Cities such as London and Birmingham boast strong academic records because they have high concentrations of ethnic minority pupils.

Bristol University researchers said the children of immigrants tended to ‘have greater hopes and expectations of education’ and were ‘more likely to be engaged with their school work’.

The findings follow claims that British firms are forced to hire foreign staff because workers here are too lazy.

A Hungarian company suggested that British workers were not prepared to stand in a factory for eight to 12 hours and find it easier to live on benefits.

The firm is recruiting staff from Eastern Europe to work for sandwich maker Greencore Group - which supplies Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda - because it cannot find locals willing to do the work.

The new study aimed to investigate the reasons for rapidly improving GCSE grades at London schools – known as the ‘London effect’.

Politicians of all stripes have leapt on the trend as evidence for the success of a range of education policies.

But the research found that the success of London’s schools can be explained by its diverse ethnic population.

White British pupils – who make slower progress than ethnic minority peers – make up just 36 per cent of 15-year-olds in London compared to 84 per cent in the rest of England.

Professor Simon Burgess, who carried out the research, said: ‘We know that ethnic minority pupils score more highly in GCSEs relative to their prior attainment than white British pupils.

‘London simply has a lot more of these high-achieving pupils and so has a higher average GCSE score than the rest of the country.’

The research shows that pupils in London schools score about eight GCSE points more than those in the rest of England after taking into account their attainment at age 11.

This means achieving eight Cs rather than eight Ds or eight As rather than eight Bs.

Although less widely heralded, schools in Birmingham also perform particularly well, the research found.

Professor Burgess added: ‘My interpretation of these results leads to a focus on pupil aspiration, ambition and engagement.

‘There is nothing inherently different in the ability of pupils from different ethnic backgrounds, but the children of relatively recent immigrants typically have greater hopes and expectations of education, and are, on average, more likely to be engaged with their school work.’

His report said: ‘The main point to take is that… being a recent immigrant or being of non-white British ethnicity has a very substantial positive effect on progress through school.’

It added said than many pupils from immigrant families ‘typically live in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods’.

‘Their advantages must be less material than books, educational visits and computers,’ the paper said.

‘It is argued that ethnic minority pupils have greater ambition, aspiration and work harder in school.’

Professor Burgess also speculated that the success of high-achieving ethnic minority pupils may rub off on white British pupils in areas such as London.

Schools in London and Birmingham were found to be less segregated along race lines than some other cities such as Manchester.

‘London has a right to be pleased with itself in terms of the excellent GCSE performance of its pupils. These results help to explain the London Effect but they do not explain it away,’ said Professor Burgess.

‘The London Effect is a very positive thing, and much of the praise for this should be given to the pupils and parents of London for creating a successful multi-ethnic school system.’

He added: ‘Multi-ethnic school systems can be very productive, allowing the ethnic minority pupils to achieve the grades they seek, and (potentially) raising the scores of white British pupils as well.

‘In parts of England where there simply isn’t a large community of recent immigrants, a focus on how to encourage pupils’ engagement with school, hard work and aspiration may pay strong dividends.’
