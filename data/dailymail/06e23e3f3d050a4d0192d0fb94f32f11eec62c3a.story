Brave: Chris Taylor from Lancashire will be the first man to take on the London marathon with a defibrillator implant under his skin

A man with a rare genetic disorder will be the first to complete the London marathon with a built-in defibrillator that will zap him back to life if his heart stops mid-race.

Chris Taylor nearly died when he went into cardiac arrest suddenly last year. Since then he has worn a small heart-shocking device implanted under his skin similar to footballer Fabrice Muamba’s.

Chris, 23, was born with a condition which means the walls of his heart are sponge-like instead of ‘compact’ like a normal heart.

It means that at any time he could suffer another arrest and must limit his physical activity at all times.

But despite his potentially deadly condition, Chris has pledged to take on the 26-mile challenge on April 22 in the hope of raising thousands for the British Heart Foundation.

His case comes just weeks after Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba dramatically collapsed on the pitch suffering from a similar heart condition.

Muamba was technically 'dead' for 78 minutes after collapsing during the FA Cup tie at Tottenham last month, but was released from hospital on Monday after being fitted with a defibrillator implant.

Chris, from Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, said: 'I heard about it after it had happened and watched it back afterwards.

'I saw the paramedics shocking him and it was very close to home for me.

'I can’t remember how long my own heart stopped for, but seeing the Muamba incident makes you remember being in that position.

Determined: Chris Taylor in training for his London marathon bid

'It’s one of the reasons that I’m so determined to complete the marathon because I want to raise awareness of heart conditions such as his and mine.'

Chris was diagnosed with the condition, called left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, at 15 after a series of MRI scans.

His a genetic illness so rare that at that time only a handful of cases had been discovered.

His father Tommy, 48, an airline pilot, carries the faulty gene and had also passed the condition on to Chris’s sister, Vicky, 24, a trainee solicitor.

High-tech: The device and how it sits under the skin

Chris decided to become a school teacher and started a two year course in geography. But just four months into his first year, he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest while lying on his bed.

He was rushed to hospital and spent four nights at the Heart Attack Centre at Staffordshire University Hospital.

There doctors gave him three options: do nothing, have a heart monitor fitted or have a high-tech subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator fitted under his arm.

The implant would not only monitor his heart but would also shock him back to life if he ever suffered another cardiac arrest in the future.

After discussing it with his family, Chris opted for the implant as he was terrified of suffering another cardiac arrest.

Chris said: 'It’s an extremely rare condition and the medical understanding of it is changing all the time.

'I wanted to do something that would help raise of awareness of my condition and others like it.'

Despite the limitations of his condition, Chris has always been fit and had long wanted to complete the London marathon like his granddad, an accomplished runner.

He applied for the race through the British Heart Foundation charity and when he was accepted he discovered he would be the first to complete it while wearing a defibrillator implant.

Chris said: 'Doing the marathon is my way of showing people that heart conditions don’t necessarily have to hold you back.

'I won’t be able to run a lot of it because of my medication but I’m still hoping to do it in about six hours.

'And although I know it’s unlikely, I know the implant is there as a safety net if the worst comes to the worst.'
