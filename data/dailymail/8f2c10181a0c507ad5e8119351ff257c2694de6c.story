Arsenal's move for David Ospina from Nice should go through before the weekend now that the French side have taken Rais M'Bolhi from CSKA Sofia.

Algeria's M'Bolhi, a 28-year-old born in Paris, was one of several keepers to impress in the World Cup.

Colombia No 1 Ospina, 25, will now head to Arsenal to complete his £3million deal.

Arsenal, meanwhile, are also giving a trial to Felix Ferahyan, a 15-year-old Finland youth goalkeeper who recently had trials with Manchester United.

Arsenal already have his national team-mate Hugo Keto on their books after the 16-year-old impressed on trial, now Ferahyan, who has dual German nationality and is 6ft 3in, hopes to have a similar impact.

One to 
be taken with a pinch of salt maybe but the rumours circling the 
corridors at the Bernabeu are that Real Madrid may be ready to 
sanction the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo following the purchase of James 
Rodriguez and Toni Kroos.

Unthinkable,
 perhaps but Financial Fair Play will come into the reasoning. Angel di 
Maria is poised to join Paris Saint-Germain as the financial sacrifice for Rodriguez but PSG say they can only do a loan with £47m following next 
summer.

Ronaldo
 is the darling of Madrid and although approaching 30 and picking up injuries, he 
still carries more goals for the side than his illustrious team-mates.

He scored 56 goals in 49 appearances for club and country last season 
and that still won't come cheap even at 29. Commercially, he is a huge 
money-maker for the club and any departure may still be a year away.

Atletico Madrid continue to hold interest in Santi Cazorla, who is not wholly content with life at Arsenal.

However, Atletico have also made an offer for PSV Eindhoven's Belgium forward Zakaria Bakkali, 18, who has been linked with Liverpool and Eintracht Frankfurt of late.

Atletico also continue to search for another striker with a similar shopping list to Inter Milan; featuring Manchester United's Javier Hernandez and Chelsea's Fernando Torres.

VIDEO Wenger with unfinished transfer business

River Plate of Argentina have made a move for Fulham striker Hugo Rodallega after Shanghai Shenhua failed to prise him from Craven Cottage.

Mexican side Pachuca, who recently agreed to sell Enner Valencia to West Ham, are also interested but don't want to pay above £2.5million.

It was initially thought the 28-year old Colombian was free to leave Craven Cottage following the west London club's relegation from the Premier League but Fulham want a fee to compensate paying his £70,000 a week wages in recent seasons.

Shanghai were keen to make Rodallega a marquee signing and despite the player being interested in leaving Fulham, he won't be going to China.

He told TyC Sports: 'I will try to get in at River. I don't think it's going to be easy this business, but I really would like to play there.

'I really would like a change and River is a very important club.'

Rodallega joined Fulham from Wigan Athletic in July 2012 but has scored just nine goals in 50 appearances in all competitions. His other option is to sit it out at Fulham and sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign side in January. 

Wigan are chasing Leicester City forward Chris Wood. The 22-year-old New Zealand star has been a target for Wolves in recent weeks but Uwe Rosler has expressed an interest with a likely deal costing £1.75m. Leicester are willing to let Wood go as they continue to pursue targets such as Troy Deeney at Watford.

Wood, who is 6ft 3in tall, has 12 goals in 34 internationals for New Zealand.

Wigan also remain keen on a loan for Chelsea midfielder George Saville.

Main man: Inter are hopeful of landing Dani Osvaldo

Inter Milan believe they are in prime position to sign Dani Osvaldo from Southampton - but they still have to agree a fee. Saints are happy to sell their record buy but want a decent return on heir £15m.

Inter have been linked with a raft of strikers including Chelsea's Fernando Torres and Javier Hernandez of Manchester United.

They have made offers but most entail initial loan proposals with fees to follow in a year's time. That is indicative of their offer to Cardiff City for Gary Medel.

While they have asked to pay £9m next season, Galatasaray have offered £10m now for the Chile midfielder. It means clubs are holding out for better offers but Southampton do want a quick resolution to Osvaldo's future.

Ronald Koeman is considering a number of targets with Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, Feyenoord's Stefan de Vrij, Jordy Clasie and Villa's Ron Vlaar all names in the frame. Manchester City's John Guidetti has also been mooted.

Sunderland scouts watched van Dijk score twice as Celtic beat KR Reykjavik 4-0 on Tuesday in Edinburgh. Southampton are also keen on Ogenyi Onazi the Nigerian midfielder at Lazio has also been offered to Everton and Liverpool.

Tough time: Marko Marin has failed to make an impression at Chelsea and is wanted by Hannover

Chelsea winger Marko Marin is wanted by Hannover. The 25-year-old had a successful spell on loan at Sevilla last season and is wanted by Besiktas but that particular deal has stalled.

Hannover sporting director Dirk Dufner is a fan of Marin who excelled with Werder Bremen in the BUndesliga prior to his unproductive move to Chelsea.

Another Chelsea youngster, 20-year-old Brazilian Lucas Piazon is wanted on loan by Eintracht Frankfurt.

Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku has been training with former club Anderlecht to regain his fitness ahead of a return to full-time training with the London outfit next week.

Everton remain in negotiations with Chelsea as they look to bring Lukaku back to Goodison Park alongside fellow Belgians Kevin Mirallas and David Henen, 18, the latest young talent out of Anderlecht's stable.

Another starlet there that Premier League clubs are looking at is 16-year-old Oliver Sarkic. Liverpool, Tottenham, Sevilla, Juventus and Benfica have all sent scouts to watch the Montenegrin striker who is a tireless worker as well as promising goalscorer.

Blackpool's recruitment drive has had more twists and turns than a fairground rollercoaster. It is only replicated by the on-off nature of Jose Riga's managerial status.

The Belgian was understood to have decided to leave the club on Tuesday but is still there as confusion reigns around the club.

Ishmael Miller had agreed a contract but has yet to sign while Riga's three desired players are also yet to be seen.

One that may arrive is another goalkeeper Milan Borjan. The 6ft 5in goalkeeper, who is 26, hails from Serbia but has 18 caps for Canada. In a colourful career, he has played at Boca Juniors, River Plate, Montevideo and Turkish side Sivasspor but he is happy to join the chaos at Bloomfield Road.
