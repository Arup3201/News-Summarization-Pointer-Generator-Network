This footage shows the incredible moment a paddle-boarder rescues a squirrel stranded on a rock in the middle of a fast flowing river in Canada.

Thomas Paterson, 22, was travelling downstream on his board in Ottawa when he spotted the furry animal sat on the rock.

Realizing the squirrel had nowhere to go, Mr Patterson, from Oakville, Ontario, swam towards it and attempted to goad it on to his board so that he could push it to safety.

Saved: Thomas Paterson, 22, managed to rescue the stranded squirrel, placing it on top of his board

But the nervous animal obviously didn't trust its warmhearted rescuer - and decided to make a break for its freedom, diving into the water.

It was immediately washed downstream before becoming trapped in a small hole underwater.

Luckily, Mr Patterson was on hand to pluck the squirrel from the current - placing him gently on to his board to dry off.

He then swam towards the river's bank - allowing the shaken mammal to leap on to the rocks and back home to the woods. 

The dramatic footage of the rescue was captured on a Go Pro strapped to the extreme sports lover's head.

Nervous: As the 22-year-old reached the squirrel, the animal became nervous and fidgety

Speaking of his heroics, Mr Patterson said: 'I wanted him to make a break for it so I could just grab him from the water.

'Eventually he tried jumping up stream, but got worked into a little hole. Thankfully I managed to pick him out of the water and place him on my board before I swam him to shore.

'Once he was on my board he realized what I was doing and just chilled and enjoyed the free ride.'

Here goes! Wary of the paddle-boarder, the squirrel suddenly decided to leap from the rock into the water 

Stuck: He was immediately washed downstream before becoming trapped in a small hole underwater

He added: 'This was one of my favourite spots for river boarding.

'I love encountering animals on the river.I realise it's their home I am swimming through and enjoy giving them the respect they deserve.

'Some animals allow me to get close to them and chill but others want nothing to do with me.

'Ever since I was young I would often cross paths with snakes, turtles, skinks, rodents, and countless other animals.'
