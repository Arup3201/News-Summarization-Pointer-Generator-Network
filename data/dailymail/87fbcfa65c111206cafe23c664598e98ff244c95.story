Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger should shoulder some of the blame for what he considers Jack Wilshere's lack of progression from his days as a teenage wonderkid. 

Scholes has been critical of Wilshere's development since he burst into the Gunners' first team as a talented 16-year-old back in 2006.

The ex-England star has now explained that he thinks Wenger, who has overseen Wilshere's progression at the Emirates, should have done a better job.

But Scholes could be left eating his words after the midfielder's sensational goal against Manchester City - a match which he was keeping a close eye on as a pundit for BT Sport.

Reacting to Paul Scholes' claim that he hadn't improved in five years, Wilshere told Sportsmail in May: 'I wanted to get to the bottom of it. I just wanted to hear what he thinks. I respect him so much. 

'We had quite a good chat. He's entitled to his opinion. He explained it a bit better and told me what I should work on.

'He was right in a certain way. I can't keep saying I've been injured a lot. There comes a time when you stop being a kid and I think that's what he's referring to.'

Asked whether Wilshere, who was named Man of the Match by commentator Michael Owen, was good enough to be starting for Arsenal before the game, the 39-year-old told BT Sport: 'I don't really know. Is he a holding midfield player or an attacking player? I think he's confused.

'I think he's a frustrated figure at the moment. He's trying to force the play.'

Aaron Ramsey revealed that he had a meeting with Wenger to turn around his poor performances and get his game back on track before the start of last season.

Scholes believes Wilshere would benefit from doing the same, even though he feels the Frenchman should have already addressed issues surrounding the 22-year-old's game.

'He needs a similar meeting  with Arsene Wenger. He needs to simplify his game,' he said.

And asked whether Wenger was to blame for Wilshere not playing to his full potential, Scholes said: 'Has has to be blamed, he's the manager. I don't know how much work he does with him, but I'm not sure he does enough.

'He has fallen so far behind Aaron Ramsey. They're trying to find a position for him and I don't know what it is.'

Jack Wilshere needs to simplify his game and stick to one position, according to Paul Scholes

Paul Scholes has also criticised the use of Jack Wilshere by England boss Roy Hodgson against Switzerland

But he did praise Wilshere after Arsenal's clash with Man City.  

Speaking on BT Sport, Scholes said: 'It shows he's an attacking midfielder capable of doing it at the highest level. It's still early in the season, time will tell. 

'What he has done is made a great start to the season, now he's got the base to go on and have a good season.'  

Scholes' criticism comes less than a week after he questioned Roy Hodgson's decision to play Wilshere in a holding midfield role in England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland.

Writing in his column for The Independent, the former Red Devils man said: 'I still have my concerns about the diamond formation in midfield (for England) and most of all about Jack Wilshere's role in it.

'Don't get me wrong, Jack has great ability and at some point I hope that he will be in a position to score goals and to create them.

'But I just do not believe that playing in front of the back four, on his own, suits him.'

After his man of the match performance against Man City, Wilshere gave his take on the game and his form. 

He said: 'Second half we did enough to win it, they could have won it too.

'I’m just trying to do what I do week in week out, I’m fitter and fitter each game.

'I felt good, I had a good couple games with England recovered well and we all felt fresh, you saw that in the first half. We started brightly, unfortunately we didn’t win.

'I think again we showed great character to come from one down against the champions. 

'I just keep playing week in week out. I got on the score sheet, I said in the past I want to score more goals.'
