Her online make-up tutorials have received 28 million video views on YouTube, but now a young beautician is using her fame to warn women about the dangers of attempting to put on make-up when driving.

Nikkie, a 17-year-old Dutch make-up artist, has created an online video of herself applying make-up before being thrown forward by the impact of a car crashing.

The 1 minute 11 second clip titled 'A crash course to shine' begins with Nikkie telling viewers she is going to demonstrate how to apply rhinestones on the side of their eyes.

She then issues instructions on how to apply the eyeshadow and a highlighter - which is normal practice in her online tutorials.

When the camera switches to a close-up of Nikkie applying the glue for the shiny gems to the corner of her eyes, a faint sound can be heard, sounding similar to creaking and her voice becomes distant.

As the camera moves into a wider shot, a startling sound of smashed glass and battered metal is heard as the blonde make-up artist is thrown forward violently - similar to the impact of a car accident.

She is catapulted towards the camera, before being thrown back limply.

The tag line follows with: '500,000 road crashes are caused by women drivers applying make up.'

The source of the horrifying information is from British newspaper, The Telegraph, in 2009 which reported on a poll of 4,000 women drivers by women's motor insurer Diamond

The video was produced in conjunction with car manufacturer Volkswagen and has spread across social network websites.

Young women, aged between 17 and 21, were found to be the most likely to put beauty before safety and most liable to crash their car as a result.
