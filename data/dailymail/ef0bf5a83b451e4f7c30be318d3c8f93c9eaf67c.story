Conservative radio host Glenn Beck has revealed that he's the bidder who won a June 5 auction of an American flag that flew over a ship at Normandy on D-Day.

Beck announced on his radio show and website that he snagged the 48-star Navy ensign at a sale of World War II artifacts and memorabilia at Bonhams last Thursday for $350,000.

The tattered flag flew aboard the American-built LST 493 during D-Day operations 70 years ago.

It had been estimated it would sell for far less: about $25,000 to $35,000.

History: This tattered American flag was flown on a U.S. ship at D-Day and was auctioned off on Thursday for a whopping $350,000

'While the human experience is itself exceptional, those who deny the will to endure and the willingness free mankind from those who wish to control and oppress miss what makes the average American truly exceptional throughout the world,' Glenn said.

Beck was listed as an unnamed online buyer when he won the spirited bidding at Bonhams in Manhattan. The auction also featured rare print-outs of the original series of hourly Dow Jones news bulletins with some of the first reports of the fighting on France's north coast on June 6, 1944. They fetched $10,000.

The flag and documents were owned by military collector and historian Rodney Hilton Brown.

The auction also included battlefield souvenirs, innovative wartime technology, rare documents and photographs from the war's European and Pacific theaters.

Among the 
higher-priced items for sale were the original designs of the Mulberry 
harbor, the massive structures the Allied ferried across the English 
Channel to use as temporary ports on Normandy's coast. The British 
innovation allowed quick resupply and reinforcement of the assault 
troops after they started advancing inland.

Sketched
 in pencil by engineer Hugh Iorys Hughes, the nine drawings had a 
pre-sale estimate of $70,000 to $100,000. But Bonham's said they did not
 sell Thursday.

Glenn Beck, a well-known collector of WWII memorabilia, and his charity Mercury One paid ten times what Bonham's estimated the flag would go for -- $350,000

More than half of the 350-lot auction is owned by Brown, a military historian and collector who also owns the original 12Â½-foot-tall version of the sculpture depicting the raising of the American flag at Iwo Jima. Inspired by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal's famous image of the event, Felix de Weldon made the stone monument seven years before his larger bronze of the flag raising was installed in Arlington, Virginia, as the Marine Corps War Memorial. The original statue failed to sell during a February 2013 auction at Bonhams.

Brown, a 71-year-old Army veteran, began collecting World War II items as a 10-year-old canvassing his Philadelphia neighborhood, telling homeowners he was collecting items from the war.

'They'd say, 'Great, take them out of here,' Brown said in a telephone interview.

Brown, founder and owner of the New York-based War Museum, said it was fitting to put his items up for sale on June 5 because June 6 was the day 'the greatest invasion in history took place.' He points out that the Dow Jones printouts from various news sources that historic day are particularly rare since they were usually tossed away or used for 'ticker tape' parades.

'Somebody knew enough to clip out and save the D-Day bulletins,' Brown said. 'It's a unique document. I don't believe there's another one in existence.'
