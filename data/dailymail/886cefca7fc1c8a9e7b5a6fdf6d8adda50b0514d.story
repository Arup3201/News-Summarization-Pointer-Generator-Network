Italian fashion designers Dolce and Gabbana have insisted they 'respect all the world' after their controversial remarks on fertility treatments infuriated Sir Elton John.

The pop star called for a boycott of the famous brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised in-vitro fertilization (IVF), which sparked outrage on social media. 

But Dolce has now insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family.

Boycott: Sir Elton John (pictured with his husband David Furnish and their children), spoke out against Dolce and Gabbana and claimed that he will never wear any of their clothes ever again after their comments

In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family. 

'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me...I respect all the world, all the culture.'

The fashion designer had previously said: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.' 

That sparked a furious reaction from John, who has two children with husband David Furnish through IVF, who fired back: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as "synthetic".

'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.'

His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand.  

But Dolce said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added: 'I love the music of Elton John.'

He said he believed they could end the dispute and added: 'Every people resolve everything by talk...we start to talk, the problem is resolved.

'Every people [has] freedom for choosing what they want. This for me is democracy. I respect you because you choose what you want. 

'I respect me because I choose what I want. This just my point of private view.'

The fashion designer also said they respected how people chose to live their lives, including the use of IVF, and said others should also respect differences in opinion. 

Gabbana insisted the duo were not telling anyone how to live their lives and added: 'We love gay couple. We are gay. We love gay couple. We love gay adoption. We love everything. It's just an express of my private point of view.' 

And when he was if he supported having children through the in-vitro procedure, he responded: 'Yeah, I don't have anything bad, because the beauty of the world is freedom.' 

However, Gabbana admitted they could have expressed themselves using better language to the Italian magazine that printed the interview, but said they were shocked by the social media backlash.

He added: 'Boycott Dolce & Gabbana for what? They don't think like you? This is correct? This is not correct. We are in 2015. This is like medieval. It's not correct.' 

Furious: Sir Elton posted a photo of design duo Dolce & Gabbana on his Instagram page and responded to their comments in a strongly-worded attack

Following John's outburst, several Hollywood celebrities tweeted their support including Ricky Martin, former tennis player Martina Navratilova and creator of TV show 'Glee,' Ryan Murphy.

Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is now close friends with Sir Elton, led the outpouring of support with the message: ''Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.' 

Gabbana had fired back on social media, calling for a counter-boycott of John and defending the 'freedom to speak.'
