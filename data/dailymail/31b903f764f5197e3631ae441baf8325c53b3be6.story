Roy Hodgson has been forced to cancel a get-together with his England players at the end of the month because Premier League managers cannot agree on a date.

England’s head coach, who returned from holiday in time to watch Crystal Palace beat Tottenham on Saturday, had scheduled the dinner for his squad for late January. 

England’s last game was in November and they will not play another international until they face Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier on March 27, followed by a friendly in Italy four days later.

Roy Hodgson was back in England and was at the Emirates stadium on Sunday following his holiday in Miami

Hodgson came up with the dinner idea after England’s 3-1 victory over Slovenia in the Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley in November and it was met with approval by his squad.

Despite many players being happy to meet, there is fixture congestion towards the end of the month with Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham playing in the Capital One Cup semi-finals over two legs.

Talks between the FA and managers have not led to a date when the clubs can release their players, even for one night.

The last time the England team were all in one place was during their 3-1 victory over Slovenia

It was a night to remember for Three Lions captain Wayne Rooney who picked up his 100th cap for England 

Despite planning a reunion for his England players Hodgson was forced to cancel due to fixture clashes

Hodgson did not intend to take a training session but he had a dinner in mind for the group of players he hopes to take to Euro 2016 in France next summer.

Hodgson returned to his desk at Wembley on Monday after spending Christmas and the new year in Miami.
