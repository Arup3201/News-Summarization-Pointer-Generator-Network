Petr Cech looks set to leave Chelsea in the summer after he revealed he does not want to spend another season as understudy to Thibaut Courtois.

The 32-year-old Czech Republic international has lost his place to the young Belgian this term, starting only four Premier League games and being primarily used in the domestic cup competitions.

While accepting manager Jose Mourinho's decision, Cech, who can class Arsenal and Real Madrid among his suitors, said the situation could not go on indefinitely.

Long-serving Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech is set to end his 11-year stay at Chelsea in the summer 

A host of clubs will be interested in signing Cech, with Spanish giants Real Madrid among the frontrunners 

'I don't know what the club's idea will be. It looks like it works well with me and Thibaut as a duo,' Cech said. 

'But that can work for one season only. I don't want another one like this,' he added while on international duty for the Czech Republic who play Latvia in a Euro 2016 qualifier in Prague on Saturday.

Cech joined Chelsea in 2004 and has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Champions League and three League Cups, the last of which was this season when he stared ahead of Courtios for the 2-0 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley.

Thibaut Courtois, in action during Chelsea's win over Hull, is now the club's No 1 goalkeeper 

With Mourinho clearly favouring Courtois, Cech's future will be of interest to a host of top clubs across Europe.

'There always will be speculation, I leave it for the summer,' Cech said. 'It will be important to sit down with the club, with the manager, to consider all the pros and cons. We will see what will work out the best.'

Asked about a possible move to European champions Real Madrid, Cech said: 'When a specific offer comes I will consider it. There are offers one cannot turn down.'
