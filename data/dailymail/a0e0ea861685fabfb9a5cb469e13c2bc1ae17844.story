Rory McIlroy revealed that as a child he dreamed of playing for Manchester United.

The world No 1 said while he felt he had made the right choice by becoming a golfer, there were times when his ambitions lay elsewhere.

Speaking to Goals on Sunday, he said: 'I think every little boy has a dream of being a professional footballer. I definitely imagined myself in the back garden scoring a goal for Manchester United.

'I like to play on the left wing and cut in. I've got a bit of speed.'

The 25-year-old admitted that United's start to the season had been poor, but felt Louis van Gaal was on the cusp of turning things around. 

He said: 'It's been a tough start but hopefully there's better things to come. 

'There were some really positive signs in that game against QPR and getting some of the players back who have been injured. 

'Luke Shaw I think will make a big difference when he comes back.'
