All of the best sportsmen can expect to have the odd bad day at the office even at the height of their fame, and this was Jeremy Lin’s first as his rise from unknown to stardom hit its first major snag.

The league-leading Miami Heat and LeBron James beat point guard Lin and the New York Knicks by 102-88 last night as they raced to their eighth straight win, with all coming by at least 12 points.

Lin was outmuscled and outfought by James as the Heat star put up 20 points, nine rebounds, eight assists, five steals and two blocks, while Chris Bosh scored 25 points and Dwyane Wade added 22.

Lin's final line meanwhile was 1 for 11 from the field, eight points, three assists and eight turnovers - far from the 23.9 points and 9.2 assists he averaged over his first 11 games in the Knicks' rotation.

‘I'm sure they were all geeked up for him,’ Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni said of the Heat defence on Lin. ‘And they took the challenge and they did a great job. It's hard to be Peter Pan every day.’

Point guard Lin described the game as a ‘learning experience’ and a ‘tough one’, in what was by far his worst performance since he came from obscurity to rescue a dire Knicks season with ‘Linsanity’.

The scene was electric and the game matched the hype for much of the night. Director Spike Lee, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr and New England Patriots NFL player Chad Ochocinco were all present.

‘He deserves all of the credit he's been given,’ Wade said of Lin. ‘We knew it was going to be a tough task guarding him. He's a good player, but we put a lot of pressure on him and it was a success.’

'I'm not going to hang my head or anything like that. I know I went out there and I played hard. Can't win 'em all. Can't have a great game every game'

Mike Stanton and Logan Morrison of baseball team Miami Marlins were on a sideline together, and members of the New York Mets' front office reportedly arrived by helicopter from Port St. Lucie.

‘In another life, I would be staying for the Knicks-Heat game tonight, then going up to Orlando for NBA All-Star weekend,’ President Barack Obama said earlier in the day.

‘But these days, I've got a few other things on my plate. Just a few.’ When Air Force One was headed to Orlando for a Thursday night fundraiser, there were televisions tuned to Heat-Knicks on board.

‘This has been about a three-week push for us and it's a good way to end before the break,’ Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. ‘I think everyone in that locker room needs a handful of days.

'He's a good player, a really good player. And they're going to do some great things. But for us, we come in and take care of business'

The Heat defence wasn't geared just toward Lin, but rather slowing the entire Knicks' offensive. New York shot 39 per cent, turned the ball over 19 times and had 10 shots blocked.

‘He's a good player, a really good player,’ James said of Lin, whom he has talked up in the past. ‘And they're going to do some great things. But for us, we come in and take care of business.’

Early on, back and forth they went, just as everyone wanted. ‘It's always big when the Knicks come in,’ Bosh said. ‘They have that New York-Miami thing. The crowd enjoyed it. And we enjoyed it.’

It was a classic Knicks-Heat game, just like the famous playoff battles in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The average price for the game on the resale markets was over $700, by one estimate.

'I'm sure they were all geeked up for him. And they took the challenge and they did a great job. It's hard to be Peter Pan every day. It's one game. We're not there yet'

‘It's one game,’ D'Antoni said. ‘We're not there yet. They're there. They're the team right now to beat for everybody. They're playing better than everybody. We're trying to get our team together.’

Lin said he was already eager for the second half to start. ‘I'm not going to hang my head or anything like that,’ he said. ‘I know I went out there and I played hard. Can't win 'em all.

‘Can't have a great game every game. But at the same time, I need to understand, “OK, what'd I do wrong? How can I improve?” I think that's going to be exciting.’

While ‘Linsanity’ has resulted in a media frenzy around the New York Knicks star, some reporting has been so racially-insensitive that one worker at ESPN was fired while another got suspended.

In response to the outrage that the racist phrase 'chink in the armour' caused this week, the Asian American Journalists Association has published guidance on how to cover the breakout sensation.

The group advises other journalists that Lin is ‘Asian American, not Asian (more specifically, Taiwanese American)’ and ‘to characterise him as a foreigner is both inaccurate and insulting’.

Here is a list of phrases and comparisons to avoid when describing Lin, according to the group:
