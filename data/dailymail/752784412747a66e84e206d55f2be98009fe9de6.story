A man who got stuck knee-deep in mud that was 'like quicksand' had to be rescued by lifeboat crews this morning.

The unnamed man escaped unharmed after he got bogged down on the banks of the River Adur at Shoreham-by-Sea in West Sussex.

He became stuck in the mud while digging for bait and witnesses say that his efforts to free himself only saw him sink deeper.

Rescue: Firefighters and lifeboat crews work to free the trapped man as the tide slowly creeps in towards him

Firefighters, coastguards and the town's lifeboat crew worked together to free the man as the tide slowly began to creep towards him.

Passer-by David Hill, who was out walking his dogs, spotted the man at around 7.30am and called for help.

He told MailOnline: I was walking up to the bridge and a man shouted and asked me to call for help.

'He seemed dead calm and I think the main trouble was that he looked really cold as he was only wearing a t-shirt. He just needed help.

'He was trying to get out but every time he moved he just seemed to sink deeper. It was like quicksand.

'I told him not to move and spoke to him until help arrived.'

Mr Hill left to continue walking his dogs while rescuers worked to pull the man from the mud.

Meanwhile, rescue crews used a dinghy and a solid mesh platform to reach the man.

And by the time Mr Hill returned to the scene to see if the man was okay, he had been dragged to safety.

'When I got back they had wrapped him in a foil blanket and I walked up and shook his hand and wished him all the best.

'He was just cold from what I gather, the paramedics checked him out but he was able to walk away as far as I know.'

Calm: The trapped man didn't seem too distressed despite his predicament said witness David Hill

Relief: The rescued man was led from the river bank in a blanket an hour after emergency services arrived
