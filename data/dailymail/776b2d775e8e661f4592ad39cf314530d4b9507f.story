The family of a young girl have claimed she had to be exorcised of an evil demon after visiting a haunted house owned by 'Ghost Adventures' host Zak Bagans.

The unnamed youngster apparently became 'possessed' by a malevolent spirit inside the home in Gary, Indiana, once described as a 'portal to Hell'.

The possession allegedly occurred during filming of Bagans' latest documentary for which he asked former residents of the property to retrace their footsteps through the haunted building. 

Spooky: The unnamed youngster apparently became possessed by a malevolent spirit inside the home in Gary, Indiana, that has been described as a 'portal to Hell'. A spooky figure was pictured in the window, and audio recordings were made of ghostly voices in 2012

The mother claimed she felt a kick in the leg when nobody was in the room before her daughter, a few weeks later, began having 'violent outbursts', TMZ.com reported today, which happens also, by apparent coincidence, to be Halloween.

Her family claim she soon began 'speaking in tongues' and threatening to hurt herself and others.

Bagans said the possession was so severe that he decided to put filming of the show on hold while he took the girl to see a Catholic priest to rid her of the curse.

One witness to the exorcism told TMZ: 'She had holes in her wrists and her eyes were red. Something's going on ... what's wrong with her?'

Bagans, who presents Ghost Adventures on the Travel Chanel, said the possession was so severe that he decided to put filming of the show on hold while he took the girl to see a Catholic priest to rid her of the curse

Bagans filmed the exorcism on camera. He claims the priest indeed managed to banish the demon from the girl's body and that she has since recovered. He plans to return to filming in December, said the website.

Bagans bought the house for $35,000 in January this year after demons tormented and possessed a mother and her three young children.

During the ordeal back in 2012 the walls of the house allegedly bled clear oil which 'froze' the finger of a social worker who touched it, and ghostly voices were recorded when police went to investigate. 

Bagans, who presents Ghost Adventures on the Travel Chanel, told the Indy Star at the time: 'It's not entertainment. I really do have a passion for this stuff and the research aspect of this stuff.' 

The ordinary-looking property became world-famous in January after the case of Latoya Ammons, a previous owner, came to light.

Ammos said that demons began to take over her house in 2012, throwing objects around and possessing her children to the point that the whole family nearly lost their lives.

Social workers, psychiatrists, priests, police officers, doctors and nurses have all corroborated Ammons story, including one incident in which her son was taken to hospital where staff watched in horror as he climbed backwards up a wall before flipping over his mother's head.

Audio recordings taken by police as they went to investigate the paranormal activity also seem to back up the story, as a ghostly voice can be heard whispering 'hey' as the officers talk. Neither of the officers recall hearing the voice that day. 

One man who did hear something, however, was Gary Indiana Police Captain Charles Austin, 62, who says after one trip to the property a growling voice came from his AM/FM radio saying 'you outta here' before it went back to static.

Terrorized: Former resident Latoya Ammons claims she and her three children were possessed and tormented by demons in the basement of her house in 2012

He was also there the day video footage was recorded of Ammos's mother giving a tour of the house. He entered a skeptic and left convinced that he had just witnessed a 'portal to hell.'

Speaking to MailOnline he said: 'Everyone of us who was there that day in the basement and who saw what we saw, went through what we went through after…we all think the same, we all call it the same. That bit of dirt is a portal to hell.'

The unusual happenings also attracted the attention of local priest Father Michael Maginot, who also set out to disprove the accounts, but ended up performing one minor and three major exorcisms on Ammons and her family, and now swears that he has been targeted by demons himself. 

Mystery liquid: During the haunting Ammons says the house seeped a clear, odorless liquid, which she claims can be seen here

Evidence? A social worker who touched the liquid apparently had her finger 'frozen' and then refused to go back

Ammons also says she saw her daughter levitating above her bed and a photograph has been circulated showing a shadowy figure standing by the window.

Zak Bagans has been producing Ghost Adventures since 2008, in which he tours haunted places with his camera crew, interviews locals about paranormal activity, investigates areas allegedly plagued by spirits and often confronts the ghosts.

According to his website, Mr Bagans became convinced of an afterlife in Trenton, Mississippi, in 2002 when he confronted the spirit of a suicidal woman in his apartment complex.
