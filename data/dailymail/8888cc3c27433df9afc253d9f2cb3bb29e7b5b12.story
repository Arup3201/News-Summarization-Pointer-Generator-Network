It was Milwaukee’s second win over the Knicks this season having won their first meeting 117-113 in November, and the teams will meet for a third time at London’s O2 Arena on Thursday, January 15.

‘Losing isn't enjoyable in any shape or form. From an emotional standpoint you have to manage what you can control and that is to be a leader for these guys.’

Bucks head coach Jason Kidd will travel to London for the third straight year to take part in the NBA Global Games having played for the Knicks against the Detroit Pistons in 2013 and then coached the Brooklyn Nets against the Atlanta Hawks last year.

He said: ‘We play hard and we're a team not built on one guy. We're built on everybody doing their job and understanding their role and doing it as hard as they can.’

‘The league is not easy. As a young team we can't take anyone for granted. They (the Knicks) are going to get healthy and be better than what their record is.’
