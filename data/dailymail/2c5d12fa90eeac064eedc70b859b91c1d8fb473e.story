Al Qaeda has set up a complaints department for residents in a rebel-held city in Syria.

Leaders posted a public notice in the north-eastern city of Raqqa claiming that they were open to receiving complaints from citizens and would promise to ensure justice through Sharia courts.

The notice stated: 'We promise that we will ensure accountability for anyone committing violations and they will be sent to the Sharia court of Iraq and al-Sham (Syria),' according to The Telegraph.

Al Qaeda has said it is open to complaints from civilians in the rebel-held Syrian city of Raqqa (pictured). The war-torn provincial capital was captured by rebel-fighters in March, who have joined forces with Al-Qaeda

Al Qaeda's branch in Iraq and the most 
powerful rebel group in Syria, al-Nusra group, joined ranks in April against 
President Bashar Assad.

The provincial capital of Raqqa became the first major city to fall entirely under rebel control in March after fighters seized it from the government.

The notice stated: 'Anyone who might have a complaint against
any element of the Islamic state, whether the Emir or an ordinary 
soldier, can come and submit their complaint in any headquarters 
building of the Islamic state.

'The complaint should be in writing, provide details and give evidence.'

It was signed the 'Emir' of Raqqa, a title that is often used by Al-Queda's leaders.

Al Qaeda's notice will be seen as an 
attempt to assume control over justice in the war-torn city and is a 
further example of its bureaucracy.

The notice is further evidence of Al Qaeda's bureaucratic leanings. Mokhtar Belmokhtar, pictured, was chastised in a pages of letters from his bosses for failing to pick up the phone or submit his expenses properly

According to The Telegraph, leaders have tried and failed to ban smoking within the city.

Mokhtar Belmokhtar, a leader of the terrorist group in North Africa, was severely reprimanded in letters sent by his superiors that were discovered by the Associated Press in Timbuktu.

According to the letters he did not file his expense reports on time or answer phone calls.

The Algerian was also berated for failing to carry out orders.

He was responsible for two attacks that killed 101 people, including the largest hostage-takings in history at a BP-operated gas plant in Algeria in January.

The letter, signed by the group's 14-member Shura Council, or governing body, describes its relationship with Belmoktar as 'a bleeding wound', and criticises his proposal to resign and start his own group.

Meanwhile, David Cameron has today reiterated his support for lifting the arms embargo on Syria.

David Cameron told the Commons that ignoring the crisis in Syria could be a 'tragedy for us to'

He said opponents to the UKs decision were making the same arguments as were used in the Bosnia conflict 20 years ago.

Speaking in the Commons, he said: 'We were told taking action would have bad consequences, just as we hear now, but not taking action is a decision too.

'In Bosnia it led to the slaughter of up to 200,000 people. It didn't stop the growth of extremism and radicalisation, it increased it.

'We should be clear about the nature of what is happening in Syria today.

'This is not just a tragedy for Syria, it can end up being a tragedy for us too if we do not handle this properly.'
