Fears have risen about a measles outbreak in Perth after two people returned there from Bali with the disease.

The revelation sparked a warning that hundreds of people could have been exposed to the virus on the flight or at various locations around the city.

The pair contracted the disease while holidaying with their family on the island. They were already sick with the virus when they travelled on Air Asia flight QZ 548 from Denpasar to Perth on December 20. There is now a possibility that passengers who were on the flight may be at risk of developing the disease.

Three cases of measles being contracted by West Australians in Bali were reported in the last few weeks

ABC reported that Western Australia's Communicable Disease Control medical coordinator Paul Effler said if anyone thought they were in those areas at the time and developed a fever with other symptoms including a cough, runny nose or sore red eyes within the next two weeks, they should stay at home and consult their doctor.

Anyone with the symptoms should call ahead to a hospital and mention their possible contact with measles so they could be isolated when they arrived at the GP surgery or emergency department.

43 West Australians having been diagnosed with the virus this year, which is a record. There has now been a total of three cases of measles being contracted by West Australians in Bali in the last few weeks. Measles is contagious for up to five days before a rash develops and four days after that.

'If you're susceptible or you're in the same area as someone as a measles case you will get it,' Dr Effler said.

'The good news is most people in Western Australia are immune to measles.

'Young children because they've been vaccinated and people born before 1966 because they actually got the disease as children.'
