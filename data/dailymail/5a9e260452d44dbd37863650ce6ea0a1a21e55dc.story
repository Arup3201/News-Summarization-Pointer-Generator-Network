A law student who runs a fashion blog on which she posts selfies wearing outfits costing under £50 has become an internet sensation.

Self-confessed shopaholic Hannah Farrington, 20, models everything from Primark bargains to funky disco pants and hired designer dresses in order to show people that it is possible to dress well on a budget.

The Manchester University student does most of her bargain hunting online, finding cast-offs on eBay for as little as £2, and mixes and matches to recycle her clothes with some of her entire outfits costing less than £50.

Her blog, Hannah Louise Fashion, took off

days with her camera resting on a shelf and set on a timer

Hannah's inexpensive style tips are proving a huge success and her blog has attracted an army of fashion followers with almost 700,000 hits.

Her blog, Hannah Louise Fashion, took off last year after she started taking selfies in her bedroom every few days with her camera resting on a shelf and set on a timer.

The redhead from Blackburn, who attended Clitheroe Royal Grammar School before university, said she only began the blog 'for a bit of fun', as she had always loved clothes.

She said: 'I think it has been a success because my outfits are much more realistic and affordable than glossy fashion magazines featuring models wearing £400 T-shirts.

'Most of my readers are on a budget too, so if I dressed very expensively many of them would lose interest.

'I think that a lot of people appreciate a blogger who can show them how to wear the same piece in a few different ways.

'A good idea is to have a collection of basic pieces like jeans, a leather jacket and black ankle boots that you can wear with more specific items.'

Budget chain Primark is one of the few 
stores Hannah regularly visits while ASOS and eBay are among her 
favourite online sources for bagging bargains

Such is her fanbase that fashion labels now deluge Hannah with free samples - and her huge wardrobe is fast outgrowing her student digs.

She said: 'It is quite surreal how many people now read my tips for ideas and inspiration and the amount of free clothes I get sent. It is every student's dream and all my friends are jealous.

'I am a hoarder who is terrible at getting rid of things and so my wardrobe is now too big for my flat.'

Budget chain Primark is one of the few stores Hannah regularly visits while ASOS and eBay are among her favourite online sources for bagging bargains.

She recently snapped up a £2 pink coat on eBay, because 'pastels are very in this winter'.

She said: 'I go to Primark because the prices are so cheap, and I like it when people are surprised that nice stuff I have found is from there rather than more expensive places like Topshop or Zara.

'If I'm on a shopping trip, I start in the cheap shops and see if I can find what I'm looking for there first.

'There's nothing worse than buying something for £50 and then finding it for £12 in Primark!'

And the savvy law student isn't shy about requesting money off, saying she always asks for discounts.

The student says she's also very in to leather trousers at the moment

Hannah suggests hiring a designer piece for a special occasion

'Some people have a particular style but I just go for bits and pieces'

'Online, I have snagged so many great last minute bargains by searching on eBay by the name of a favourite shop or particular item.

'Other shops I like to look at online include Topshop, New Look, H&M, American Apparel, River Island and Miss Selfridge.'

She described her own style as 'indecisive'.

She said: 'Some people have a particular style but I just go for bits and pieces that I have seen around that I like.

'I am amassing a fairly vast collection of fluffy jumpers in all shapes, styles and colours.

'Other than those and my pink coats, I'm very into leather trousers at the moment.'

She also recommends vintage and charity shops: 'They take a little bit more effort but it pays off and you can often end up with something much nicer and more unique than the high street item you had your eye on.'

For those who cannot resist designer labels, she advises researching outlet stores and timing visits to coincide with the arrival of new stock.

And for that one-off special occasion, she suggests hiring a £700 designer dress for a fraction of the sale price.

Despite her fashion success, Hannah is still set on pursuing a legal career

'I do get some guys asking what they should buy their girlfriends and what they should wear too'

Hannah's fashion following is not just female. She said: 'I do get some guys asking what they should buy their girlfriends and what they should wear too.

'My boyfriend takes all the pictures of my outfits as I am going out or coming back in. He is not a massive fan of doing it, but it works out all right.'

Despite her fashion success, Hannah is still set on pursuing a legal career.

She said: 'I have a lot of friends who have fashion retail jobs and they work so hard for so little reward. I think it is a really difficult industry to get into.

'I have my sights set on being a solicitor, which would help pay for my clothes shopping!'
