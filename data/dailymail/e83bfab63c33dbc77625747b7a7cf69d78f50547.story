In two days, Hollywood actresses will grace the most glamorous red carpet in the world for the Academy Awards, with millions of eyes watching them.

So no wonder they’re pulling out all the stops to look their best on Sunday – no matter what the cost.

Manhattan-based dermatologist, Dr David Colbert, whose clients include Michelle Williams, Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz, has set up a temporary pre-Oscar beauty clinic in Beverly Hills where actresses can swing by for a 20-minute version of his signature Triad facial.

The famous Triad facial costs between $800-$1,200 (£550-£700), dependent upon the type and strength of chemical peel used and the number of laser pulses performed.

The three-part facial, which takes around 30 minutes, combines microdermabrasion (to gently exfoliate), laser toning (to help boost collagen production) and, for the after-glow, lavender flower acid combined with Dr Colbert’s own line of products.

Dr Colbert also unveiled his new new Tone Control Facial Discs - individual pads that promise a 'brighter complexion and even out skin tone'

The 20-minute version in Los Angeles 
already has a raft of celebrity fans: Robin Wright, Emma Stone, Rachel 
Weisz, Michelle Williams and Heidi Klum have all booked in for the Triad
 this weekend.

The treatment claims there is no redness, so you’re red carpet-ready as soon as you leave.

'We offer a mini version of the Triad that’s tailor made for Hollywood’s Oscar red carpet,’ says Dr Colbert.

'It gives immediate results and, most importantly, there’s no downtime.’

Naomi Watts, who will be presenting an Academy Award during this year's ceremony, is a long-time fan of the treatment.

‘It is my absolute favourite treatment,’ she told Pret-a-Reporter magazine.

‘David and I have been friends for many years, nd over the years he has been taking care of my skin.'

But the Triad facial is not the only treatment on offer in Beverley Hills

While in town, Dr Colbert is also unveiling two new products: Illumino Body Oil; $100 (£60), and Tone Control Facial Discs, $72 (£43) for 20 discs – individual pads that promise a ‘brighter complexion and even out skin tone.’

The Illumino Body Oil is a spin-off of Dr Colbert’s hottest-selling product Illumino Face Oil.

‘Michelle, Rachel and Naomi all use it under their make-up to give them a glow,’ he says.

The body oil is a lighter weight version with hydrating passion fruit, orange and argan oils plus anti-aging retinol.

‘It’s for a sleek look overall and gives a nice healthy glow,’ says Dr Colbert, who added that many of the town’s top actresses will be gifted bottles in their Oscar goodie bags.

‘I think we will see it on some of the most beautiful women in Hollywood on Sunday’s red carpet.’

And you don't need to be a Hollywood star to reap the benefits.

Both products are coming to the UK in March, and will be available at Space NK stores and online.

Tone Control Facial Discs will be priced at £65, whilst the Illumino Body Oil will be £90.
