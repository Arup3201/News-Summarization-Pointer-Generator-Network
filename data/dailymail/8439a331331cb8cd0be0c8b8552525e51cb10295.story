The Holy City of Jerusalem has been covered in a brilliant white blanket after the worst snowstorm in 20 years.

Schools and highways have been closed as up to eight inches of snow piled up in the city centre by this afternoon.

Israel and much of the surrounding region has been hit by five days of rain, wind and snow as temperatures have dipped below freezing.

Although average winter temperatures can be chilly, it is unusual for the city to see such heavy snow in the winter.

The Jeruslaem to Tel Aviv highway was closed this afternoon due to the cold and icy conditions.

Many Palestinians in the hilly occupied West Bank were also snowed in and dozens were forced to flee flooded homes.

Snow is not uncommon in Israel, and the country even boasts a ski resort in Mount Heron.

But
 heavy snowfall in Jerusalem is rare, with average temperatures staying 
at a mild 9 degrees, even in the coldest months of January and February.

A flurry of white flakes may descend every three or four years during 
cold winters but the city hasn't seen such deep snow since 1992.

Back then, as much as 12 inches fell and police had to go on national TV to give drivers advice on how to drive in the snow.

The rest of the year Jerusalem enjoys average temperatures of 18 degrees and 3,400 hours of sunshine.

Elisha Peleg, an official in charge of 
emergencies with the Jerusalem Municipality, urged the city's residents 
to remain at home and stay off the streets, telling Army Radio the area 
had overnight seen its greatest snowfall since 1992.

He said 10 to 15 cm of snow had piled up in the city centre and more than that in outlying areas.

'The downtown area is bathed in white,' Peleg said.

'The elders of Jerusalem don't remember such a snowstorm in years.'

Public transport has ground to a 
halt, and many vehicles that ventured onto roads were stuck, he added, 
urging citizens to remain at home. 

The
 Jerusalem light rail resumed service today just before noon, but 69 bus
 lines remained out of service, with icy roads making travel tenuous.

Jerusalem’s outlying neighborhoods were the first to celebrate the arrival of snow in the capital on Wednesday.

The
 higher neighborhoods, including Gilo, Ramot and parts of Pisgat Ze’ev 
and Armon Hanatziv had 2 centimeters of snow on Wednesday afternoon.

Snow blanketed the rest of the city at 9 pm and fell for about half an hour.

Some traffic arteries opened later in
 the afternoon as temperatures rose and some snow melted. Public bus 
services partially resumed and were free of charge in Jerusalem, as an 
incentive to keep private vehicles off the slushy roads.

In the occupied West Bank, city 
streets were largely abandoned, with few residents chancing the hilly 
and widely rutted roads and schools kept shut because of the weather.

A general strike by government employees also kept Palestinians in their homes, as the Palestinian Authority has been unable to fully pay salaries following Israeli economic sanctions announced last month in anger at a campaign that won de facto United Nations recognition of Palestinian statehood.

The Palestinian meteorological institute said that snow levels in the Ramallah, East Jerusalem and Bethlehem areas had reached 10-20cm and as much as 30cm in Hebron.

Flooding was reported in the northern West Bank, where water 'inundated dozens of houses and widely damaged agricultural areas local farmers depend on for their livelihoods,' Jenin governor Talal Dweikat told Palestinian Radio.

'Dozens of families have been forced to flee their homes, but thank God there have been no deaths, and the Authority is dealing with the problem aggressively despite its financial problems,' Dweikat said.

Jerusalem’s Fire and Rescue Services responded to more than 500 calls for assistance on Wednesday, after dozens of antennas and trees, and even a balcony, collapsed due to strong winds.

Emergency services rescued two adults and three children from a jeep using ladders, after the driver tried to fjord a river near Ein Kerem.

Firefighters have rescued around 20 vehicles from large puddles and flooded roadways, including a minibus with seven children early Wednesday morning.
