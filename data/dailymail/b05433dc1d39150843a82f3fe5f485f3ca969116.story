It was built solely for purpose, to enable scientists to live comfortably as they carry out vital research work in the freezing cold Antarctic.

But thanks to its strikingly futuristic appearance, the Halley VI centre has been causing quite a stir in architectural circles, and it has now been nominated for a prestigious global award.Â 

In a textbook example of form following function, British architect firm Hugh Broughton 
created the series of four-legged pods, seven of them blue and one red, 
which stand on moving ice and can be raised to keep them above the snow 
which builds up.

Form follows function: The Halley VI centre, a dismantlable research station created for the 
British Antarctic Survey by British architects Hugh Broughton, has been 
nominated for the World Architecture Festival Awards 2013

The dismantlable research station, 
which few fans of design will ever get to see unless they venture to the
Antarctic wilderness, is among the nominees for the World Architecture 
Festival Awards 2013.

Halley VI is the sixth facility to occupy the site on the Brunt Ice Shelf - a floating sheet of ice about 10 miles (16 kilometres) from the edge of the South Atlantic.

Most of the previous stations were crushed under the weight of the polar snow, while Halley V had to be abandoned due to fears that the station would be lost if the ice sheet split apart, said survey spokesman Paul Seagrove.

Halley VI is made up of four-legged modules linked by enclosed walkways. The centre is designed to house between 16 and 52 members of staff, depending on the time of year. A central social hub gives residents the chance to relax and contains a dining room, bar and a gym.

Solitude: Antarctica is the most isolated place on Earth - but its 
remote location means the scientists have been able to see the stunning 
aurora australis

Futuristic: Scientists are housed in triple-glazed modules that sit on skis high above the snowy surface

Home from home: The modules include house labs, a dining room, a bar and a gym

Linked: The scientists do not need to go outside to move between modules as they will be joined together by walkways

A vacuum drainage system keeps water 
consumption down, and the ski-clad stilts keep the units about 4 metres 
(13 feet) above the level of the ice. The inside of the centre has been 
been specially designed to support crew numbers ranging from 52 in the 
summer to 16 during the three months of total darkness in winter, when 
temperatures at the base drop as low as -56C.

It has triple-glazed windows and a 
quiet room at the north end of the station is included for residents to 
contemplate the Antarctic environment in peace.

The centre, which could easily pass 
for the set of a 1970s science fiction TV series, is up for the 'higher 
education/research' section of the awards, one of 29 categories for 
which buildings compete in Singapore in October.

Other nominees include British-based 
Zaha Hadid, whose Heydar Aliyev Centre in Baku, Azerbaijan - clad in 
curved folds - competes in the 'culture' category.

The WAF Awards, now in their sixth 
year, have drawn entries from nearly 50 countries and include the 
National Arboretum in Australia, a media centre in Kazakhstan and an 
opera house in South Korea.

Paul
Finch, WAF programme director, said: 'From the subtle to the 
spectacular, from a four-room house to an 80-storey tower, the sheer 
quality and diversity reflected in the array of projects shortlisted 
today demonstrates the increasingly global nature of the event.'
