 A motorist has been caught speeding at 149mph – more than twice the legal motorway limit and a record for the past year

Others have been caught doing three times the legal limit in 30mph zones – one near a rural primary school.

The motorway offence, on the M25 near Swanley in Kent, was captured by a speed camera and was the highest recorded speed during the period April 2013 to May 2014.

The figures revealed that  another driver caught  by the same speed camera clocked up 146mph at Swanley on the M25, with two more hitting 127mph.

New digital cameras have recently been installed on the M25 and older ones re-activated.

The  offences were revealed in data received from police under a Freedom of Information Act request from the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM).

The highest speed recorded on a 30mph road was 96mph in Leam Lane in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear – more than three times the legal limit.

That just pipped the 94mph clocked up in the 30mph zone near New York Primary School on the B1192 Langrick Road in Lincolnshire.

In other 30mph zones, drivers were  filmed doing  92mph on the B1522 in Gateshead; 86mph in  Court farm Road, Longwell Green, Avon and Somerset;  86mph in Luton’s Sundon Park Road, Bedfordshire; and 84mph on the A4103 at Leigh Sinton in West Mercia police’s area.

The highest speed captured on a 50mph road was on the A414 Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire, where a motorist clocked 119mph.

The highest on a 60mph road was 127mph on the A413 Wendover bypass in Buckinghamshire.

And one driver  hit 113mph in a 40mph A17 Station Road at Swineshead Bridge in Lincolnshire – some 73mph above the limit.

The fastest speed recorded last year in a 30mph zone was 96mph, however, one motorist passed New York Primary school in Lincolnshire at 94 mph

The IAM report noted: ‘A motorist in on the M25 at Swanley holds the record for the highest speed clocked by a speed camera in England and Wales between April 2013 and May 2014.  The 149 mph figure was revealed following freedom of information requests to 39 police authorities.’

But the IAM says the penalties which ‘excessive speeders’ face are ‘out of sync’ with the danger they pose to other road users and to themselves.

IAM head of road safety  Kevin Delaney said: ’Let’s be clear – we’re not talking here of otherwise law-abiding motorists who are trying their best but may make a careless mistake and slip a few miles per hour above the posted speed limited.

‘These are dangerous drivers who are  speeding at two or three times the legal speed limit, sometimes near schools. They are selfish individuals putting people’s lives in danger.’

Guidelines to magistrates on sentencing for speeding include a fine plus six penalty points  or disqualified  for between 7 and 56 days for motorists who drive  at 101mph  and 110mph on a 70mph road; at between 76mph  and 85 mph on a 50mph road; or at between 51mph and 60mph in a 30mph zone.

IAM chief executive Simon Best said: ‘Speed limits are a limit. They are not a target to beat.

Unfortunately this message has not got through to many motorists and it’s clear that efforts to make speeding as socially unacceptable as drink-driving continue to fail.’
