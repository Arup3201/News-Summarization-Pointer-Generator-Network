Country star Garth Brooks has rejected a deal to stage two matinee gigs to complete his five-show comeback special in Dublin.

The 52-year-old singer was offered the extra gigs on the weekend of July 26 and 27 at Croke Park, to take place before a second night-time show on each day.

It was proposed by Dublin City Council as a way to break the standoff over the cancelled concerts.

But now, Brooks has turned down the offer, saying it 'cannot possibly compare to a five-night straight run' and would be too much for him at his age.

In a webcast at 5pm yesterday, he also highlighted the logistical challenge of having 160,000 fans descend on Croke Park each day.

‘I don’t have a problem with matinees but sticking 160,000 people out in the middle of the day, I don’t know if I’m more worried for them than me because I’m getting older,’ he said.

‘I personally would do whatever it takes except cancelling on people. We sold 160,000 tickets to people who were coming to see the full show, and that show is only full at night.’

Last night, following tense behind-the-scenes talks, Aiken Promotions also confirmed the proposal was 'not feasible'.

And Brooks’s U.S. publicist Nancy Seltzer remarked: ‘To treat 160,000 people differently than all the rest who will be seeing the show the way it was meant and created is wrong.

‘He does not understand why it is once again put upon him to treat people less than they deserve to  be treated and he still returns to why did they allow five shows to be sold and all these people to be disappointed. It is not his decision – it is, with the greatest of respect, the city council’s.’

Earlier this week, Brooks issued an all-or-nothing ultimatum when city chiefs granted permission for just three out of the five planned sold-out gigs, which 400,000 people have booked tickets for.

The star, who has sold more than 130million albums, said to choose one show over another 'would be like asking to choose one child over another'.

He told a press conference: ‘If the Prime Minister [Taoiseach Enda Kenny] himself wants to talk to me, I would crawl, swim, I will fly over there this weekend, sit in front of him.

‘I will drop on my knee and beg for those 400,000 people to just have fun and let them come see. That’s what I want to do.'

Thousands of fans were given brief hope as news emerged of a potential breakthrough yesterday evening - with many hoping all five gigs would get the go-ahead, with a break between the final two.

Shortly before 7pm yesterday, the council said that after a meeting between city manager Owen Keegan and Aiken Promotions, they would allow two matinee shows on the afternoons of the weekend concerts.

‘Following a meeting this morning between Peter Aiken of Aiken Promotions and Owen Keegan, chief executive of Dublin City Council, the City Council has agreed to a proposal from Aiken Promotions designed to break the impasse that has arisen,’ a statement said.

The council suggested that the matinee shows ‘will allow everybody who bought a ticket to see Garth Brooks’.

‘It will be a matter for Aiken Promotions and Garth Brooks to decide if they wish to pursue this suggestion,' it said.

A spokesman added that the proposals involved ‘having the same concert on twice in the same day’.

But Brooks's management later rejected the proposal, telling Dublin Lord Mayor Christy Burke it would be unworkable for the star, who is known for his high-octane shows.

Sources close to Mr Aiken told the Irish Independent: 'This was nothing short of a flyer, a possibility. And it is quite clear it ain't going to run.

'To stage two concerts in the afternoon would be a logistical nightmare'.

It comes as Taoiseach Enda Kenny has snubbed Brooks's emotional appeal for him to intervene in the matter.

He told the Irish Daily Mail that it was ‘not a case of Mr Politician moving in on top of the law and saying, “You have to do this”’.

He said: ‘We have processes and legal systems in the country here, at the same time we have a very can-do attitude and I think the progress made today by the City Manager and the promoter and all of the organisations involved have put on the table here a potential solution to this so lets see.’

‘Mr Keegan made his decision in accordance with the law and his responsibilities so it’s how can you move it from that to a realisation that these concerts can take place, so let’s see, we will continue to show an interest in hoping that it might be able to happen.’

The Taoiseach added: ‘People [near Croke Park] have withdrawn their objections and as the representatives of the people down in the Dáil, we would like to see these things happen so I hope that’s one potential solution that might be accepted and we will see what happens.’

Speaking on Primetime on RTÉ last night, Dublin Lord Mayor Christy Burke still didn’t rule out Garth Brooks making a comeback.

‘I’m not going to say “never never”,’ he said.

‘To my knowledge the management team are still on board. I got a  call from my source at Aiken promotions asking for a review of the  plans tonight. I would like to see everybody facilitated, and if that is by having two gigs in three nights than so be it.’

Meanwhile, Eamon O’Brien, chairman of the Croke Park Streets  Committee, described the situation as a ‘crisis’.

He said: ‘The way that the community has been affected by this is quite enormous, there’s been division, and a man who wanted to take a case has been threatened.

‘This is not proper social responsibility coming from Croke Park.’

Elsewhere, Mr Kenny revealed that he was a fan of Garth Brooks. He indicated he had tickets for one of the concerts, adding that he would be one of the 400,000 people who would be ‘out at the moment’ because of the cancellations.

He said people had been sending him their letters and their texts about the plans they had for the concerts and the arrangements they had made.

He said: ‘For those who are big followers of Garth Brooks music this would [have been] a wonderful occasion.’

During his online press conference yesterday, an emotional Brooks said: ‘Today we should all be laughing and joyous but there’s a cloud hanging over us.

‘Up until ten days ago it was nothing but love. Then came the thing, they said “Hey Garth, we’re okay with three of them you’re going to have to do figure out the other two.”

‘I wish I knew where that came from. It’s a simple yes but for some reason the system keeps throwing it back here.’ He added: ‘The reason why it’s a dark cloud: everybody in Ireland who is sad about this you’re not one billionth as sad as I am.

‘I’m the real loser here, I’m the guy who’s out the greatest experience of his life.

‘You can’t talk about a future [for large scale events] in Ireland until Ireland has a system that works. Let those five shows be played and fix the laws after that. It’s a simple fix.

‘But for some reason the problem keeps getting thrown back here.

‘The system should be looking at itself saying we have flaws.’

He continued: ‘You have a gentleman in a certain political position and he’s standing by that decision. Let that gentleman do his job  but there should somebody who should walk over to him and  say, “We’re going to allow these  people to come and sing and have a good time.”

‘I don’t have a clue how we got here. All I know is that the powers that can fix it are not there.

‘It’s a simple yes, open up for five nights, let everybody have fun then go to work on never letting it happen again. Create your laws, create  your guidelines but don’t sell a  show to people and get their hopes up that you’re going to just cancel on them and that’s okay. I don’t think that’s okay.

‘Everybody knows we don’t do golden circles. We don’t elevate tickets or drop tickets for people with more money. We treat everybody equal. It’s the luck of the draw.’

He added: ‘I want to hear “Garth, welcome to Ireland”. I was there six months ago and I heard “Garth, welcome home”.’

It is understood that a solution to the matter must be found by Monday.
