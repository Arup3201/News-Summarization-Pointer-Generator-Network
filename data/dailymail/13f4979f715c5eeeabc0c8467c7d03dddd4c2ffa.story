Three rescuers and a swimmer they had just plucked from the sea had a lucky escape as the helicopter they were in crashed into the water just yards from one of the world's most famous beaches.

The Fire Department chopper was flying back to shore close to Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro after rescuing a swimmer who had got into difficulty further out at sea.

But in a dramatic twist of events the rescuers had to be rescued themselves after the red helicopter's blades looked to splutter and falter and the aircraft slowly began to fall towards the water.

It landed a matter of metres from where unsuspecting swimmers frolicked in the waves.

The terrifying incident was captured in a startling video clip captured by one of the many hundreds of beachgoers watching from the shore.

The helicopter is seen flying at a low height above the water before hitting the water and momentarily disappearing in the waves and turned on its front before appearing to begin to sink slowly into the water.

Shocked screams of those standing watching can be heard in the footage and many rushed to the waters edge to get a better look at what had happened.

Fortunately none of the chopper's four occupants were seriously hurt, suffering only minor injuries.

But the the incident could have been worse with the Copacabana thronged with beachgoers enjoying scorching temperatures in the high 30s and low 40s.

A Brazilian Navy ship, which was in waters nearby, and a Fire Department vessel searched for the stricken helicopter moments after it had crashed.

The Rio de Janeiro state Fire department said that an unspecified mechanical failure had caused the helicopter to crash.

The 4km stretch of beach is situated in the Brazilian city's Zona Sul or Southern Zone and will play host to millions of revellers during new year celebrations.
