The Milwaukee woman who brutally killed a pregnant mother and tried to steal her full-term fetus has been sentenced Thursday to life in prison without the possibility of extended supervision.

Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, was convicted earlier this year of two counts of first degree intentional homicide; one each for Maritza Ramirez-Cruz and her unborn son.

Morales-Rodriguez told investigators after her arrest that she was desperate to give her boyfriend a son, and that she drove around for days before the murder looking for a pregnant woman to kill.

In September a jury of six men and six
women convicted Morales-Rodriguez of two counts of first-degree 
intentional homicide in the October 2011 deaths of the mother and fetus.
 Wisconsin doesn't have the death penalty.

Prosecutors said Morales-Rodriguez faked a pregnancy, panicked as her supposed due date approached and then lured 23-year-old Maritza Ramirez-Cruz to her house.

There, she attacked her and used an X-Acto knife to cut the fetus out, according to the criminal complaint.

Ramirez-Cruz died of blood loss and asphyxiation, and her fetus, a boy, died as a result of her death, authorities say.

Morales-Rodriguez's defense attorneys didn't deny that she attacked Ramirez-Cruz. But they argued that the deaths of the mother and fetus weren't intentional because Morales-Rodriguez didn't intend for anyone to die.

Morales-Rodriguez did not testify during the trial, and her attorneys did not call any witnesses.

The strongest evidence against Morales-Rodriguez was a videotaped interview she gave to police in which she recounted the attack.

Victim: Maritza Ramirez-Cruz, 23, was expecting her fourth child when she was murdered last October. Her baby boy, who she planned to call Omar, also died

Guilty: Morales-Rodriguez admitted she had scoured the suburban Milwaukee neighborhood for two weeks looking for a pregnant woman whose child she could steal

She explained to investigators that she was desperate to give her boyfriend a son but that she couldn't 'stay pregnant.'

She said she twice pretended to be pregnant, only to claim each time that she miscarried.

When she lied about a third pregnancy, she considered another scenario: killing a pregnant woman and stealing her baby.

She described how she went to a Hispanic community center and found Ramirez-Cruz, a mother of three who was in her 40th week of pregnancy.

Morales-Rodriguez told police she bashed Ramirez-Cruz in the head with a baseball bat, then choked her until she passed out.

She said she then put duct tape over the younger woman's eyes and nose and wrapped a plastic bag around her head.

She then used a small blade to slice the victim open from hip to hip and pulled out a stillborn boy, Morales-Rodriguez said in the videotape.

She then called 911, telling a dispatcher she had just given birth to a baby who wasn't breathing.

In the ensuing investigation and autopsy, a medical examiner found evidence that the baby wasn't the product of a natural birth. A subsequent examination verified Morales-Rodriguez hadn't given birth.

Police later found Ramirez-Cruz's body in Moralez-Rodriguez's basement, according to the criminal complaint.
