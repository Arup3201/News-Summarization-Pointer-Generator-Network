Software used to analyse medical brain images gives significantly different results if it’s run on a Apple Mac or PC, according to new research.

The findings by a team of German researchers has raised concerns about potential problems with software analysis.

Data from 30 brain scans was fed into the computer using a
package called FreeSurfer.

Variation: The differences in cortical grey matter volumes between FreeSurfer version v4.3.1 and v5.0.0 on a Mac (OSX 10.5)

Contrasting results: Marked differences in subcortical grey matter volumes between FreeSurfer version v4.3.1 and v5.0.0 on a Mac (OSX 10.5)

The software is one of the major medical image analysis 
programmes used to measure the size of different parts of the brain.

The research team ran the software on Windows and on Macs running  different versions of Mac OS.

They found that not only did Windows and
Mac OS installs of the software produce different results - but the 
version of Mac OS also had an impact, reported Gizmodo.

The findings by a team of German researchers has raised concerns about potential discrepancies with software analysis

Each time the software was used it measured the size and thickness of various structures of the brain.

The level of differences between computers varied depending on brain location.

For Mac vs PS and Mac OS updates it was closer to 2-5 per cent.

But there was a 15 per cent variation just because of a Mac OS update.

The discrepancy between the results remains unclear.

On the U.S. National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health, the abstract concludes:

'The main conclusion is that in the context of an ongoing study, users are discouraged to update to a new major release of either FreeSurfer or operating system or to switch to a different type of workstation without repeating the analysis; results thus give a quantitative support to successive recommendations stated by FreeSurfer developers over the years.'
