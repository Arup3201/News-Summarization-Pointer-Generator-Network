Taxpayers will foot a $125,000 bill to help fund Casey Anthony’s legal defence team because she ran out of money.

The  'world's most hated mother', 25, of Orlando, Florida, was acquitted earlier this month of murdering her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008.

Her lawyers, who have been reimbursed for most expenses by the state, say she is safe and receiving hundreds of job and housing offers.

The $537 balance from her jail canteen fund after her release on Sunday is hardly enough to live on, but she seems to be managing fine.

Taxpayers began picking up Anthony's legal expenses in March 2010 after she ran out of money and was declared indigent by the courts.

So far, the state has reimbursed her lawyers for $119,000, the Justice Administrative Commission said, with another $5,800 bill pending.

Prosecutors have not finalised their overall expenses but have identified at least $91,000 in costs, a State Attorney’s Office spokesman said.

Still being calculated are the costs of the huge three-year police investigation that began in July 2008 when Caylee was reported missing.

Anthony falsely claimed her 
daughter had been kidnapped by a nanny. The toddler's skeletal 
remains were found in December 2008.

Anthony was convicted of lying to detectives during the investigation and sentenced to the maximum four years in jail.

But with credit for time served awaiting trial and good behaviour while in jail, she spent less than two weeks more behind bars after her sentencing.

Anthony has indicated she will appeal her convictions and is requesting that the state continue to fund her defence.

A hearing is scheduled on August 25 for Judge Belvin Perry to decide what portion of the trial and investigative costs Anthony should bear.

After that, the question will be whether she is able to pay up.

But taxpayers are not the only ones with a stake in Anthony's financial resources.

Protests: Casey Anthony's case has captured the nation, with many believing she is still guilty of killing her daughter even though she was acquitted

Lawyers for a woman suing Anthony for defamation are demanding details on any book, film or interview deals she has been offered.

They also want to know of any offers for appearances on TV shows or in adverts, or for purchasing the rights to any documents in her possession.

Speculation abounds that she could sign a big contract to tell her story, and theories over where she is since her jail release have also run wild.

Lead criminal defence lawyer Jose Baez told Orlando station WKMG that Anthony left town. ‘She's not here in Orlando,’ he said.

Earlier this week producer Al Taylor claimed to MailOnline that he has already met with Casey Anthony to discuss a $1million television deal.
