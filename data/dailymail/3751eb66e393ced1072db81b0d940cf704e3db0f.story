Gary Neville believes Manchester United have no chance of winning the Premier League this season as they don't have enough quality in defence.

A Robin van Persie brace handed United a 2-1 win against Southampton on Monday night, but Louis van Gaal's side managed just three shots in the match, the lowest number by any team in the Premier League this season.

However, it is United's defensive quality that really concerns Neville, and the former full back believes his old side are some way off being able to challenge for the league title.

Gary Neville said he doesn't believe his old side are good enough to win the Premier League this season

Speaking on Sky Sports 1's Monday Night Football, he said: 'I don't think (they can win the league), they don't have the quality. 

'They've been decimated with injuries. To say can they go and win the title? I think they're too short defensively at this moment in time. I don't think they're at that level I really don't. 

'They're going to have to step it up. They look shaky on the ball. They lack counter attack, they lack speed, they didn't have anything.

'They've got away with murder tonight. United will be happy with the result but they will have to play better than that. 

'I think they will get better, they're showing a bit of resilience. That's a good quality to have but they need to play better.' 

United looked shaky at the back and Louis Van Gaal was forced to make changes before half time

Chris Smalling was also substituted due to injury, leaving Louis van Gaal with even fewer options
