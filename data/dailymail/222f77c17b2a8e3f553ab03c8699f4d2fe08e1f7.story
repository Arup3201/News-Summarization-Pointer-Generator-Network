The offices of Commons Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans have been searched by police investigating claims of rape and sexual assault.

Detectives seized ‘parliamentary material’ from Mr Evans’s Westminster offices after being granted a warrant by a judge at Preston Crown Court.

The Attorney General and the Solicitor General were informed about the searches and concluded that there were ‘no lawful grounds’ to oppose them.

Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans was arrested earlier this month over allegations of rape and sexual assault

Commons Speaker John Bercow said he had been consulted before officers entered Parliament.

At the weekend he faced renewed pressure after it emerged that a third man has told police he was also abused by the Deputy Speaker in the House of Commons two years ago.

Mr Bercow said in a statement to MPs at the start of today's sitting, he said: 'I wish to report to the House that the rooms of a Member were searched yesterday pursuant to a warrant issued by the Circuit Judge in Preston Crown Court on 16 May.

'The warrant related to the investigation of a serious arrestable offence.'

Mr Evans has been relieved of his duties chairing Commons debates since his arrest on May 4. He will not return to the job until the police inquiries have concluded.

According to the Sunday Times a third alleged victim gave a statement to Lancashire constabulary after hearing about the MP's arrest over two other claims of sexual assault.

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said today: 'We have confirmed that we have searched offices in London in connection with the investigation but it is inappropriate to comment any further other than to say that we have gone through all the appropriate and necessary procedures before taking this step.'

Mr Evans returned to Parliament days after his arrest and release on bail, but will not take up duties chairing Commons debates while police inquiries are ongoing

Mr Bercow told today MPs that the 'precincts of Parliament are not a haven from the law'.

In 2008 police controversially searched the office of Tory frontbencher Damian Green over leaks obtained from the Home Office.

Commons authorities then set new rules on the execution of search warrants within Parliament.

Mr Bercow said he considered the warrant to search Mr Evans' office 'personally' and was advised by Officials that 'there were no lawful grounds on which it would be proper to refuse its execution'.

He also consulted the Attorney General and the Solicitor General who agreed with the advice.

He went on: 'The Serjeant at Arms and Speaker's Counsel were present when the search was conducted. Undertakings have been given by the police officers as to the handling of any Parliamentary material until such time as any issue of privilege is resolved.

'The investigation is continuing and it would not be right to comment further. I will not take questions on my statement.'

After being bailed Mr Evans was pictured outside a pub in his Ribble Valley constituency reading cards from wellwishers

After his arrest Mr Evans, the MP for Ribble Valley, read a statement outside his Lancashire home vehemently denying the accusations against him.

The senior Tory spoke of his ‘incredulity’ after being arrested over allegations by two men he had until then ‘regarded as friends’.

Mr Evans, who came out as gay in 2010 after years of gossip, said he had just endured ‘the worst 24 hours of my life’.

He said: ‘The allegations are completely false and I can’t understand why they have been made.

‘I appreciate the way the police have handled this in such a sensitive manner, and I’d like to thank my colleagues, friends and members of the public who have expressed their support and – like me – a sense of incredulity at these events.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
