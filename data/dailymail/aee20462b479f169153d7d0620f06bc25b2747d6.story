While their Premier League rivals were kicking off the season on Saturday, Chelsea's players were relaxing ahead of their Monday-night opener.

Jose Mourinho's team begin their campaign against Burnley after all the other teams have had the opportunity to make their mark, but they don't look like the pressure is getting to them.

Brazilian midfielder Willian posted a picture to Instagram from the massage table, while his international teammate Filipe Luis went a step further, posing from an ice-bath with Andre Schurrle and Cesar Azpilicueta.

Azpilicueta also posted a group selfie with five fellow players as the Chelsea players took time for some team bonding after training on Saturday. 

Jose Mourinho's men were given a boost ahead of the Burnley fixture with the news that Didier Drogba, who had been expected to miss several weeks with an injury picked up in pre-season, should be fit to play.

Mourinho said: ‘I think he can play Monday. I cannot say now yes for sure but normally I think he will.’
