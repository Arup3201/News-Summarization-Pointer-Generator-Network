TV host David Letterman sparked anger when he suggested Presidential candidate Mitt Romney was a 'felon' over his taxes.

The Late Show host told his audience 'we have a felon running for president' during a discussion over poll results which showed 6 per cent of Americans wanted to see Romney's tax returns.

His comments came in spite of recently released IRS documents showing that Romney paid almost £2milliion in 2011 alone.

He said: 'Yeah,
we want to get a look at those tax returns because I believe we will 
discover that the man has not paid a nickel in United States federal 
income tax.

'That’s right, we have a felon running for 
president.'

Rebuff: The letter showed that Romney paid an average of 20 per cent in taxes every year between 1999 to 2009

It is not the first time such severe accusations have been made about Romney's tax status, Fox News reported.

Stephanie Cutters, Obama's deputy campaign manager, suggested in July that it would be a 'felony' if Romney misrepresented information on federal documents when he left his company Bain Capital.

In the same month, Romney was accused of not paying any taxes for 10 years by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who cited an anonymous source and has not revealed where his information came from.

However, in response to this, Romney released a letter from Price Waterhouse Coopers showing he paid an average of 20 per cent in taxes every year between 1999 to 2009.
