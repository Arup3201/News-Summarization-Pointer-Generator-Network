Nigel Pearson is set to apologise for his foul-mouthed abuse of a Leicester fan — but also reiterate his belief that the club needs the backing of supporters amid this troubled run.

The Leicester manager reacted furiously when taunted by a home fan towards the end of the loss to Liverpool on Tuesday night and is understood to have sworn.

Leicester have launched an investigation into the incident.

Pearson: 'I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn't like what he sees, then don't bother coming'

Pearson is under pressure with his side bottom following a winless streak stretching to nine games — but his job is not believed to be in jeopardy.

He has a good relationship with the club’s Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and signed a three-year contract last June.

It is recognised, however, that using an expletive to verbally attack a Leicester supporter, within earshot of children, is not acceptable.

Pearson is expected to use Friday's scheduled press conference to apologise for any offence caused by the flashpoint, which came next to the tunnel after he left his customary seat in the stands for the final few minutes. 

In the immediate aftermath of the defeat Pearson admitted to a ‘spat’ saying: ‘I replied to one idiot in the stands and if he doesn’t like what he sees, then don’t bother coming.’ 

He then added: ‘Maybe they ought to think about staying at home. We’ve worked hard and will continue to do so. I don’t like the commitment of my players being questioned.’

Cliff Ginetta, the chairman of Leicester’s supporters club, believes an apology is warranted and would enable Pearson to move past the incident and retain the support of a majority of fans.

He said: ‘He should put his hands up, admit he was out of order, apologise to the people and move on, that’s all everyone wants. We don’t want to play it out like a pantomime, we just want to get on with winning games. People are worried and moaning but that’s football fans.’
