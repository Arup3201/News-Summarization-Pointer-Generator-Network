A heartbroken community gathered today for the funeral of two young brothers who died in a canoeing accident which also claimed the life of their five-year-old friend.

Ewen Beaton, five, and his brother Jamie, two, were in a six-man canoe which capsized on Loch Gairloch in Wester Ross, in the Scottish Highlands, on Sunday August 26.

They were airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but they died later that night.

Still missing: Ewen Fraser Beaton, 32, has not been found since the incident and sadly is presumed dead

The body of the boys’ 32-year-old father, also named Ewen, is still missing. He is presumed drowned.

Family friend Grace Mackay, five, was also pulled from the water after the accident but she too died last week in Glasgow’s Yorkhill children’s hospital.

Grace’s sister Callie, eight, and their father Garry, 35, managed to swim the 500 metres to shore and raise the alarm.

The boys’ funeral took place at Inverness Crematorium.

Mourners began arriving in numbers 
with almost an hour to go before the service began at the quiet 
location, set in extensive grounds.

Some hugged and comforted each other before going into the crematorium for the service.

A hearse carrying flower wreaths arrived at the building as mourners continued to take their seats inside.

The Beaton family, from Beauly, near Inverness, previously offered thanks for the efforts in trying to find Mr Beaton.

In
a statement, they said: 'We would like to thank the police, coastguard,
RNLI and all the other emergency services who did everything they could
for little Ewen and Jamie.

'We would also like to thank everyone
for their tireless efforts in the ongoing search for Ewen, including 
emergency services, local residents and visitors to Gairloch.

'Our focus remains firmly on finding Ewen and bringing him home.

'We
would again like to thank everyone for their continued efforts to find 
him, particularly our dear friends in the local community.

'Our thoughts are also with the Mackay family at this extremely difficult time.'

The search for Mr Beaton has involved helicopters, lifeboats, police dogs and divers.

Northern Constabulary has said it will keep looking for him for the foreseeable future.

Ewen was in his first year at Teanassie primary school near Beauly.

Acting headteacher Alison Donald said 
Ewen’s mother Jo is a cleaner at the school and that the thoughts of the
staff are with her and the family.

'Everyone
in the school recognises Ewen as a lovely, lively, little boy who was 
always fun to have around. His younger brother Jamie always had a cheery
smile when he visited the school,' she said.

'It’s
been very difficult. It’s a small community and there’s 54 children in 
the school and seven in the nursery, with only maybe about 30 families. 
So everybody feels it very much together.'

Grace,
who just started primary two at Tarradale primary school, was laid to 
rest on Wednesday in her home town of Muir of Ord, near Inverness.
