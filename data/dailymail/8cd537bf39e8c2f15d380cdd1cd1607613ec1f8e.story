The largest warship in the British Navy's fleet and thousands of additional soldiers have arrived in London to ensure security is not breached during 2012 Olympics.

Spectators watched on as helicopter carrier HMS Ocean was manoeuvred into its dock at Greenwich, east London, yesterday where it will serve as a mighty military defence and home to service personnel during the Games.

Security of the global sporting event has been at the top of London Major Boris Johnson's agenda this week after contractor G4S admitted it needed additional soldiers to plug a 3,500 staffing shortfall.

It was a careful operation to manoeuvre the vast vessel into position on the river, where it will be used during the Olympic Games as a base for helicopters and military personnel

Boris has put the ongoing Olympic 
security shambles down to 'pre-curtain-up jitters' and believes the 
public will be pleased to see thousands of extra armed soldiers guarding
 the Games.

The Mayor of London said yesterday 
the city is the best-prepared host ever and the 3,500 forces staff 
brought in to plug a gap left by the failure of G4S to find enough staff
 will ensure London 2012 is safe. 

G4S was reportedly paid a staggering 
£284million to provide up to 17,500 personnel for the 2012 Games, but 
this week admitted it couldn't do it with only a fortnight to go until 
the opening ceremony.

David Cameron today said: 'If 
companies don’t deliver on their contracts then they should be pursued 
for that money', in an attack on the beleaguered security firm.

Their blunders mean thousands of soldiers – some only just back 
from gruelling tours on the Afghan front line – have been ordered to 
cancel home leave or holidays with their friends and families to form a ring of steel at Games venues.

Ready for action: A fearsome Lance Corporal - who cannot be named for security reasons -  a trained sniper with the a high-ranking regiment, shows what he will be doing throughout the Games

Deadly: These troops and thousands more will use all their specialist training to deal with threats at London 2012

In action: The pair will be two of thousands who will be in Britain aiming to ensure that London 2012 is safe from terror attacks

Experts: Snipers will leave their base at RAF Northolt by helicopter to protect London 2012 from above

Mr
 Johnson today added his backing saying the Army would add 'tone' to the
 Games as they do at the Wimbledon tennis championships where they 
control crowds.

'I
 think we are in the stage now of pre-curtain-up jitters and you would 
expect the media, quite properly, to be focusing on all the areas where 
people feel there may be imperfections or things we need to nail down 
and clearly transport and security have always been the big question 
marks,' Mr Johnson said.

'But
 I’m very confident that at this stage London is better prepared for the
 Olympics than any previous Olympic city has ever been.'

Asked if G4S had his 
confidence, he said: “I think the Games are going to be very safe, very 
secure and the arrangements that are going to be made by G4S, by the 
Armed Services, will deliver very good results.

'We
 have increased the number of people who will be involved and I think 
anybody who goes to Wimbledon and sees the role of the Armed Services in
 venue security, making the thing run well, will like it. It will add an
 element of tone to our proceedings over the next few weeks.'

David
 Cameron also tried to be positive, saying: 'I think we should be 
raising our sights, and thinking of the incredible inspiration that 
these Games are going to bring.

'The facilities are built, the country is ready, we are in really good shape.'

It came as it also emerged hundreds of
 A-level students have been hired as front-line guards at the Games to 
fill the security void when the games starts in two weeks.

They are among 3,300 teenagers recruited from colleges around Britain to help form a ring of steel at the venues for £8.50 an hour.

Reinforcements: Police patrol the River Lea near the Olympic stadium in a powerboat. They will be providing extra security and emergency responses if anything happens

Security experts expressed alarm that youngsters aged 18 and 19 had been entrusted with searching spectators and bags.

The company was contracted to provide a minimum of 15,400 security staff, with a target of 17,500.

This week the Government confirmed the call-up of 3,500 extra troops, G4S claimed it would be able to bring in 13,800.

However, with 14 days to go to the Games,
 question marks remained whether it would meet even that target, as just
 a small fraction of that total is available for deployment.

Security problems: A soldier on duty at the Olympic park in Stratford on Thursday. He'll soon be joined by 3,500 other troops

Preparations: Two squaddies wearing their identification badges walk towards an exit from the Olympic Park today

Service: Military personnel walk past the iconic Olympic rings in the park today. Many soldiers had been expecting a summer break but are now having to work to secure the Olympics

Thumbs up: London Mayor Boris Johnson greets a security staff member at the Olympic Park and claims the Games will be better because of an increased army presence

Only 4,000 are ‘boots on the ground’, working as ticket checkers and bag searchers at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London.

Another 9,000 are still in the 
training and vetting process – raising fears even the more reduced 
target might not be achievable.

The Armed Forces now make up the overwhelming majority of the security staff likely to be deployed during the Games.

The
 original plan for 7,500 military is bolstered by a special contingent 
of 5,000, plus the 3,500 announced on Tuesday, making a total of 16,000.
 In addition, there will be 3,000 unpaid volunteers.

Spot the sniper: The soldiers are stationed at the very top of this block of flats in east London where they have installed deadly weapons

Logistics: The men look across the London skyline and consider what faces them over the coming weeks

Getting to work: Soldiers look out from a top of a housing block in Leystonstone which has been kitted out with the weaponry to defend the Games

Alone: This weapon is one of many across various locations in London that will be fired if needed

A legal bid by the residents of the Fred Wigg tower, in Leytonstone, pictured, to stop the installing of surface-to-air missiles was dropped after the High Court rejected the challenge yesterday

The
 number of staff needed to guard the Olympic venues more than doubled 
last December after the organising committee Locog wildly underestimated
 the total required. Originally Locog contracted G4S to provide 2,000 
security guards, but in December the firm agreed to increase that number
 massively.

But locals are expected to be reassured by the presence of very sever anti-terrorist measures around the Olympic site.

Soldiers in residential tower blocks 
and green open spaces were yesterday pictured installing surface-to-air 
missiles at six sites across the capital, a show of strength not seen in
 this country since the Second World War.

Yesterday, the military began 
installing Rapier and high-velocity missile systems at the six sites in 
Leytonstone, Bow, Blackheath Common and Oxleas Wood, both in South East 
London, Enfield and Epping Forest.

Work: Men continue to file in with items to prepare and install the missile launcher

Security: Surface-to-air missiles have been installed at a number of sites across the capital, including this Rapier missile system on Blackheath Common

Show of strength: With two weeks to go before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games, the deployment of missile systems marks a dramatic development in the security operation. Right, soldiers are pictured preparing the missile site on the top of Lexington Building, Tower Hamlets. It is part of the biggest peacetime security operation the country has ever seen

The most controversial of these is at the residential block Fred Wigg Tower in Leytonstone, east London.

Swarming like ants across the rooftop, members of the Royal Artillery were pictured setting up the weapons.

Troops carried truckloads of equipment up the 17-storey block ready to 
assemble it to protect the Olympic Games from terrorist attack.

The Starstreak high-velocity missile systems, whose laser-guided weapons
 have a range of 3.4 miles, are so powerful they can bring down an 
aircraft.

Residents this week lost their bid to force a judicial review into the decision to deploy the air defences above their heads.
