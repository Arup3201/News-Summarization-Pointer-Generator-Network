A 22-year-old woman in Newark, California was handed the wrong credit card after paying for her meal and decided to go for a shopping spree rather than return it to it's rightful owner.

Jheline Demesa of San Leandro was celebrating her birthday at Ray's Crab Shack Sunday when the waitress handed her bill back with another table's credit card. 

Instead of pointing this out, the birthday girl ditched the restaurant for the shopping mall across the street.

The other table immediately noticed that they got back the wrong card and notified police around 6:20pm.

They cancelled the card but not before Demesa was able to get in a few charges at shops in the NewPark Mall.

The restaurant owner was able to help out by printing off Demesa's image caught on the surveillance camera.

The victim used this to walk over to the mall and search for Demesa.

With the help of mall security, the victim found Demesa still casually shopping with the stolen credit card around 8pm.
