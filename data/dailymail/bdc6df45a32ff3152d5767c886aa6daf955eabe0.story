The third biggest National Lottery jackpot ever is up for grabs tonight with a truly life changing £141million prize.

A single EuroMillions lottery ticketholder winning that amount could splash out immediately on a Learjet 85 to take them and seven friends anywhere they liked - in fact, they could buy a dozen, organiser Camelot has said.

That person would become the 572nd richest in the country, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

Living the high life: Anyone scooping tonight's £141m National Lottery jackpot could afford to lead a jet set lifestyle and have money to spare

They would also become the UK’s third biggest National Lottery jackpot winner to date.

Top of the National Lottery Rich List are Colin and Chris Weir who banked a £161 million EuroMillions jackpot in July 2011.

They are Europe’s biggest lottery winners. In second place are Gillian and Adrian Bayford, from Haverhill in Suffolk, who won more than £148 million in August last year.

If piled high in £50 notes then the jackpot would reach 1,017ft into the sky - the same height as the tallest building in Western Europe, The Shard.

All smiles: The couple said they struggled to fully appreciate the moment they realised they had won the jackpot as their young son had just woken-up and was crying but eventually the life-changing news sank in

Celebration: Adrian Bayford, 41, and wife Gillian, 40, were the sole winners of a £148.6 million jackpot

The sky's the limit: The Bayford's are Britain's second biggest Lottery winners ever after scooping an eye-watering £148m jackpot

If laid end to end, the notes would take you 13,670 miles, from London to Hawaii and almost all the way back.

The £141million jackpot would truly be a life-changing amount of money.

But what exactly could someone who scooped the third biggest National Lottery prize ever buy with their new-found wealth?

If no-one matches all five main numbers and two Lucky Star numbers to win the jackpot, then it will roll over to Tuesday’s draw.

The
jackpot can grow to a maximum of 190 million euros - depending on the 
exchange rate at the time this would be around £162 million.

Any prize money which would have 
boosted the jackpot above 190 million euros is passed down to the next 
prize-winning level, boosting the prizes to those winners.

A National Lottery spokesman said: 
'All of us would secretly love to jet off to somewhere hot at the drop 
of a hat, and with this EuroMillions jackpot in the bank you could.

'We 
have our fingers crossed that another UK ticketholder will win big and 
we encourage all players to get their tickets early.

'EuroMillions, which is drawn every 
Tuesday and Friday, helps to contribute to the £35 million generated for
National Lottery Good Causes each week.'

Current predictions suggest the cap 
is most likely to be reached in next Friday’s draw, if no one wins the 
jackpot between now and then.

winning £45,169,170.50 on EuroMillions jackpot in February this year

Once the jackpot has reached the 190 million euro cap, it can roll over only once before it must be won.

If the jackpot is not won in the first EuroMillions draw when the cap is reached, it will stay at 190 million euros for the next draw.

If there are no jackpot winners in that next draw, the whole jackpot amount - the 190 million euros plus any prize money that would have boosted the jackpot over this amount - is passed down to the next prize-winning level.
