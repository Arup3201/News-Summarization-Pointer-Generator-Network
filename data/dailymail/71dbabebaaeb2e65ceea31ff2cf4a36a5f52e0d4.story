These are the eerie images of an abandoned train yard in Hungary where visitors can see rotting carriages once used by the Nazis to transport hundreds of thousands of Jews to their deaths at Auschwitz concentration camp.

The pictures, taken at the Istvantelek train workshop near Budapest, are a snapshot of a bygone era, with huge locomotives standing in a crumbling shed that is slowly being reclaimed by nature.

The repair shop opened in the early 1900s and has witnessed 80 years of tumultuous Hungarian history that included the fall of a monarchy, Nazi occupation and transformation into communist state loyal to the Soviet Union.

Among the decaying carriages are trains that look identical to those used by the Nazis to transport nearly 440,000 Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz between May and July 1944.

British photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the dilapidated building, described what it was like inside. 'The roof was falling to pieces but it made for dramatic effect as shafts of light pierced the otherwise dingy interior helping plant life to grow,' he said. 

'It was definitely eerie being in there, I'd read online about the carriages being used by Nazis and some of them looked identical to the ones you can see in photographs taken at Auschwitz... It was shocking to think of the horrors that may have taken place on the carriages I was photographing,' he added.
