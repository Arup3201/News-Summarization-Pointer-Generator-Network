They are a London institution, who have brightened the streets for 125 years and, as this Pearly King shows, the capital's alternative Royal family are still going strong.

Reclining in a Pearly throne adorned with hundreds of ornate buttons, this King was one of dozens who descended on London's streets yesterday.

The organisation, which has raised millions of pounds for the capital's charities since it was founded in Victorian times, was out in force for its annual Harvest Festival.

Tradition: Pearly titles are normally passed down through families and they have been raising money for charity in London for 125 years

Watched by hundreds of people, the Pearly Kings and Queens paraded from the Guildhall to St Mary-le-Bow Church, home of the Bow Bells.

About 30 families took part and marched in their traditional costumes of black suits and hats decorated with the famous white buttons.

The parade is held every year to mark the changing of the seasons and raise money for charity.

The tradition - started by the 
original Pearly King, Henry Croft - has been kept alive by the Pearly 
families, who have passed their titles through the generations.

Today,
families from each London borough attended the event, which raised 
money for the Whitechapel Mission, walked the route alongside donkeys and carts.

Kings and Queens were also joined by a number of 'Pearly Princes and Princesses', who are too young to be given the full title.

The tradition began more than a century ago as a way to raise money and add a dash of cheer and cheekiness to ordinary London life.

Pearly Kings and Queens have become icons of working class culture with 'royal families' now in every borough in the capital.

Henry Croft, the original Pearly King and founder of the movement, was an orphan who later became a street sweeper.

He got the idea for the decoration of Pearly outfits after working alongside apple sellers who festooned their suits with buttons down the sides of the legs and on the waistcoat and cap.

He designed his own bright outfit with pearl buttons he found during his job as a street sweeper.

He became a local attraction and used his popularity to collect money for his old orphanage.

His success meant other charities called on him to help raise funds for them, and so he asked the market traders to help him - and the Pearly Kings and Queens were born.

Today, about 30 'royal families' - one for each London borough - are still active.

They usually pass the titles down through the generations but people who have raised a lot of money for charity can be 'crowned'.

Croft's great-granddaughter is the Pearly Queen of Somers Town.
