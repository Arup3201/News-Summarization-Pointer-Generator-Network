These stunning images may look like abstract works by the likes of Picasso - but they are actually aerial photographs of the world we live in.

Known as the Overview Effect, these incredible views are sometimes experienced naturally by astronauts during spaceflight.

While orbiting the Earth, the astronauts' perspective changes and they begin to see patterns in the natural and man-made world they just left.

A website, the Daily Overview, is dedicated to this effect - posting daily patterns that can be seen on Earth from above using images from Satellite company DigitalGlobe.

Some of the aerial patterns that can be found using DigitalGlobe's software are well-known wonders such as Central Park in New York, USA and the Palm Jumeirah, Dubai. Others are less common - like the cubist effect of Barcelona's streets or the cell-like patterns in some of Florida's towns.

Abigail Van Uum, spokeswoman for DigitalGlobe, said the company had recently grown to include five satellites, creating the capacity to collect more than one billion square kilometres of imagery to its archive this year alone.

'We plan to launch a sixth satellite on August 13 2014 which will enable accurate satellite imaging through haze, fog, dust, smoke and other air-born particulates.'

It isn't the best seat in the house, but this view has its own appeal. It is the Billie Jean King Tennis Centre in New York - the site of many famous US Open tennis matches

This is Venice as you've never seen it before - the island city is famed for its beauty from the ground but is equally stunning when captured from high above

This image captures the word 'Lueke' on a Texas farm, which is famous simply for the landowner's decision to fell trees in a pattern which revealed his name

The Our Lady of Almudena cemetery, in Madrid, Spain, (left) looks dizzying from

 million buried in it, while pictured right is the district of La Plata, in Argentina, which is home to the famous South American football team Estudiantes de La Plata
