Fled: Paul Meekin (above) was the subject of a police investigation in India, where he was a teacher

A British teacher who once claimed he taught Daniel Radcliffe has reportedly left India, where police were investigating him over child  abuse allegations.

Paul Meekin, 40, was the principal of Trio World School in Bangalore when he was accused of sending lewd messages online to a 13-year-old boy in January 2012.

Now it is claimed he has moved to Kuwait and taken a job teaching social studies at an international school.

The report in the Daily Mirror claims he took the job at an English-Arabic bilingual school a few weeks ago and may have shaved off his beard.

Meekin made widespread headlines in India in 2012 when he was arrested while leading the £1,400-a-year Trio international school, which teaches international GCSEs and A-Levels to English-speaking pupils.

Just three months earlier Meekin had laid on an English high tea and a tour of the school for Ian Felton, the British Deputy High Commissioner in Bangalore. 

Meekin was accused of sending lewd messages to a boy online, and police  filed charges against him under India's Juvenile Justice Act and Information Technology Act, according to a report at the time by the Mail's India edition Mail Today.

He was later reported to police by his school amid claims he had 'fabricated certificates' related to his academic qualifications when he took the job in 2010.

A police spokesman told Mail Today at the time: 'We have seized his passport and are trying to obtain his real name and address.'

According to other reports in Indian media, he was released on bail last year while he awaited trial on the charges which related to his alleged lewd messages.

Earlier this year Indian media claimed he had missed a magistrates' court hearing and his whereabouts were unknown.

School: Meekin was the principal of the Trio World School in Bangalore when the scandal emerged in 2012

Three years ago Meekin is said to have claimed he had  taught Daniel Radcliffe at a London primary school before he gained his starring role in the Harry Potter films.

In an interview with the Times of India, he was quoted as saying: 'I taught him science, but was a temporary teacher and taught only for a short while.

'I remember him as a very happy kid, sitting in one of those middle rows, third from the back. But he was not regular to classes because he was already into acting.

'I did not even recognise him when I watched the first movie of the series. Children change a lot, you need to look into their eyes to recognise them. It was much later that I recognised him by his name and said, "Oh it's that boy".'

It is not clear whether Meekin did ever teach the child star.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman declined to comment.
