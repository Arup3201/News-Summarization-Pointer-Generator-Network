An online shopper got the fright of his life when a live mouse leapt out of his grocery bags and ran around his kitchen.

Nick Bain was unpacking his Tesco shopping at his home in Clacton, Essex, when he noticed something stirring in one of the bags.

The 41-year-old was shocked to then see a mouse dart out from one of the plastic bags and scurry across the floor.

After he phoned Tesco to complain, the supermarket sent a team of pest control experts whose trap later caught the creature.

Bosses have refunded and replaced the shopping and sent Mr Bain's wife a large bouquet of flowers to apologise as she is petrified of mice.

It was one of the first times Mr Bain and his wife, Hayley, 28, had used Tesco's online delivery service.

The car salesman said: 'I was going through the bag and I didn't realise it was there but when I put my hand in I saw something move.

'I told my wife there was a mouse in the bag and she jumped off the floor. It was just so fast. It's the last thing you expect with a delivery.'

Mr Bain managed to film the mouse on his mobile phone shortly after it emerged from the rubbish.

In the footage he captured, the mouse can be seen darting across the floor of the kitchen, which is currently being re-fitted.

The couple were worried about their two Staffordshire bull terriers, Max and Bruno, eating the mouse in case it was diseased.

The mouse was later caught in a trap after 'scratching for two nights solid'.

Mr Bain said the  incident left him wondering what might have happened to other people's shopping which was also on the delivery van.

He added: 'It disgusted my wife and it makes you think if it was in the van, whose other bags had it been in and whose other food had it urinated on.

'To be fair to Tesco, they gave us some flowers and some treats for the dogs and sent Rentokil around, they've been pretty good.'

The shopping was delivered last Thursday and the mouse was captured in a trap on Saturday.

A Tesco spokesman said: 'We've apologised to Mr Bain and the local online food shopping manager has visited him to deliver flowers, a replacement order and a gesture of goodwill.

'A thorough check of the store by pest control found no evidence of further problems, so we're still investigating to find out exactly what happened.'
