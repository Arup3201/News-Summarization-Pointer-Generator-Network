Ryan Johnson is Stevenage's youngest ever player and is training with Manchester United

Manchester United are taking a look at Stevenage Borough centre back Ryan Johnson.

The 18-year-old is joining up with United at their Carrington training complex after impressing scouts with his performances for Stevenage and their Under 18s.

Johnson started at West Bromwich Albion, where he spent seven years as a schoolboy and was offered a scholarship. However, he believed he had a better chances of breaking through at Stevenage and made the switch there in 2013.

They gave him a two-year scholarship and he quickly impressed, began training with the first team and signed professional terms a year early. He was on the substitutes' bench a number of times last season before making his debut in May in the 2–0 defeat by Brentford.

He became Stevenage's youngest ever debutant at the age of 17 years and 215 days. Johnson played at left back in the game but earned glowing praise from manager Graham Westley.

He'll spend a week at United in the hope of impressing staff.

Newport County's 16-year-old defender Regan Poole, who also had a training spell at United earlier this season, will complete his move to Fulham in the next few days but will be loaned back to the League Two promotion chasers for the rest of the season.

Meanwhile, Manchester United have not stepped into the race for Juan Cuadrado. Chelsea remain in talks with Fiorentina about the player's £26.8million buy-out and reports in Italy say that United have shown an interest and offered Adnan Januzaj on loan to sweeten the deal. 

However, United remain focused on deals for the summer with a centre back and right back the priority. A winger is on the agenda while they will also take stock of what strikers are available. 

QPR will not be pursuing a deal for Monaco striker Dimitar Berbatov.

Monaco will allow the 33-year-old to leave for £1m and Berbatov's family are keen on a return to London. Crystal Palace, Everton and Hull have also been sounded out but the Bulgarian is looking for wages of £70,000 a week.

Berbatov is one of several big names available in the window and clubs are weighing up the gamble as they look to stay in the Premier League this season.

Alexandre Pato is another who QPR have turned down, as have Hull. The Brazilian is only 25 but has lost the sparkle he showed while at AC Milan and is keen to revive his career and profile with a move to England.

Pato's loan fee from Corinthians is £1.5m while his wage demands are £75,000-a-week. Some clubs have explored paying him less with a £1m bonus at the end should they stay up. Similar proposals have been made to Berbatov's camp.

Everton and West Brom have also spoken about Pato but Hull's board believe the deal is too rich a gamble.

Darren Fletcher is continuing talks with clubs on Wednesday. The 30-year-old has a favourable offer from West Ham while West Brom are keen to speak to him again. A preferred deal to Valencia looks unlikely at this stage.

United are willing to make a financial contribution to the Scotland international's move.

Wigan are poised to follow up the signing of Inverness striker Billy McKay with a £1.5m double swoop on Leeds United.

Sportsmail revealed at the weekend that Malky Mackay had opened talks to bring in centre back Jason Pearce from Elland Road and he has now added Leeds midfielder Rodolph Austin to the deal.

The clubs were discussing the fee on Tuesday night as Northern Ireland international McKay arrived in a £150,000 deal.

Cardiff had shown a strong interest in Austin but Malky Mackay looks to have persuaded the Jamaica captain to turn down his former club for a greater challenge at the DW Stadium. Wigan face a tough battle to stay up and are now eight points behind Rotherham, who beat Bolton on Tuesday night.

They have agreed to sell Adam Forshaw to Middlesbrough and Callum McManaman to West Brom but shedding their wages should allow Mackay room to bring in a few loans also for the fight ahead.

Wigan have also had an offer rejected for 23-year-old Feyenoord striker Mitchell te Vrede. 

Derby Couty have asked about taking Tom Ince on loan from Hull City.

Manager Steve McClaren has attempted to prise Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips from QPR but the Loftus Road club will only sell rather than loan. 

McClaren said: 'We are a bit light in that area and we are looking to do something in the loan market in the next couple of days.'

Wigan, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough have also asked about Ince who is on the periphery at Hull despite their injury crisis. Manager Steve Bruce is continuing to search for a striker.

However, Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez are both in line for surprise returns from injury against Newcastle United on Saturday.

Both were expected to be ruled out for up to six weeks with injuries but they took part in a full training session during City’s warm-weather training camp in Portugal on Tuesday.

Swansea City are considering a move for Blackburn striker Rudy Gestede. The 26-year-old is valued at £6m by the Championship side and so far no club has matched their valuation.

Crystal Palace made a £3.5m offer over a week ago but that was rejected and they were expected to return with another offer. Hull and West Brom pulled out at an early stage believing the player was overpriced. 

However, Swansea were impressed by his performance against them at the weekend and are contemplating a move. Garry Monk insisted he would not be following up any interest in Jordan Rhodes and that he was not looking to add a striker, but with recent results he may go for extra security before the window closes.

Crystal Palace hope to agree terms with Shola Ameobi but are reluctant to allow Fraizer Campbell to join QPR.

Rangers asked for Campbell as part of a deal for Jordon Mutch as Palace have fallen short on their valuation of the former Cardiff midfielder.

QPR want around £5m for the 23-year-old Mutch unless they can persuade Palace to give them Campbell, 27, as part of the deal.

Ameobi, 33, was at Palace's training ground for further talks on Tuesday as reported in Sportsmail. His signing would leave Alan Pardew with six strikers on his books.

Middlesbrough are monitoring developments with James Morrison at West Bromwich Albion.

Manager Aitor Karanka signed Adam Forshaw from Wigan on Wendesday morning but wants another attacking midfielder and has designs on Morrison, who the club asked about last year.

Morrison has been starting under Tony Pulis but Middlesbrough want to test Albion's resolve to keep him. They have enquired about a loan for Graham Dorrans but Albion will only sell and want around £3million for the Scotland international.

Sheffield United head into their Capital One Cup semi-final against Tottenham with the future of teenager Diego De Girolamo shrouded in doubt.

The 19-year-old, who scored against Preston in the FA Cup, is out of contract in the summer and new terms have yet to agreed. Girolamo, born in Chesterfield, has played for Italy Under 20s and had a recent spell on loan with Russ Wilcox at York. 

Charlton, meanwhile, are maintaining the Belgian theme at the club by targeting 30-year-old midfielder and former Belgium international Christophe Lepoint at KAA Gent.

Diego De Girolamo scored for Sheffield United at Deepdale in the FA Cup last Saturday 

St Etienne are hoping to strike up an alliance with Manchester City involving their youth academy. 

City maintain no formal deal is in place but good relations between the clubs has seen City send representatives to the French club’s training ground to discuss facilities and possible exchanges. 

St Etienne are currently giving a trial to Manchester City youngster Divine Naah. The Ghanian 18-year-old attacking midfielder had recently returned from a loan at Stromsgodset.
