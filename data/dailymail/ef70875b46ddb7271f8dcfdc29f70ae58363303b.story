NRL coach Craig Bellamy today led tributes to his former teammate Ryan Tandy at his funeral, as the tragic rugby ace's mother told mourners she was 'proud to be his mum'.

Ryan Tandy, 32, was found dead at his parents’ home in Saratoga, New South Wales, last week after a suspected drug overdose.

Bellamy led the tributes at today's funeral service, telling mourners Tandy would always be remembered as a ‘larrikin’ who had a good sense of fun.

The Melbourne Storm coach added that he will ‘never forget’ the front-rower during his eulogy in Palmdale on the Central Coast on Wednesday afternoon.

According to the Daily Telegraph, he said: ‘He told you exactly what he was thinking and I liked that about him.

‘When he got into first grade he was telling me who should and shouldn’t have been in the team. I was Origin coach at the time and he told me who should and shouldn’t have been in that team too.’

A host of sports stars attended the service for former Ireland national player – who also played for Melbourne Storm and the Canterbury Bulldogs as well as five British teams.

Former Bulldogs captain Andrew Ryan, Brett Finch, Michael Sullivan and Roosters playmaker James Maloney also attended the service.

They were joined by Tandy’s Central Coast Storm teammates Alex Moore and Alan Munro.

Tandy’s mother Carol, who was supported by his brothers Ben and Scott, told the gathering she was proud of her son.

‘I stand before you with my head held high and can proudly say I’m Ryan Tandy’s Mum. There wasn’t a day he wasn’t loved and I’m thankful for every day I had with him,’ she was quoted as saying in a Daily Telegraph report.

She added that her son had been trying to turn over a new leaf when he died after several brushes with the law following his life ban from the NRL for match-fixing in 2012.

The former journeyman front-rower had been living at his parents' apartment as part of his bail conditions after he was charged with allegedly kidnapping a man on January 16.

Tributes poured in from across Australia following the news of his death.

A statement from Rugby League Ireland, for whom Tandy played in the 2008 World Cup, said: ‘Rugby League Ireland would like to pass on our condolences to the family and friends of Ryan Tandy.

‘Ryan was a larger than life character and we would like to express our thanks for the commitment during the World Cup.'

Hull's Kingston Rovers rugby league club said in a statement: 'The club are shocked and saddened by the news of the death of former player Ryan Tandy.

'Ryan served Hull Kingston Rovers with distinction during his time with the club and our thoughts go out to his family and friends at this difficult time.’

‘It's important that people know who the real Ryan Tandy was ... he was a generous man with his time,' Tandy's former coach Keiran Dempsey told Triple M.

Over the course of his tumultuous career, Tandy featured in 36 NRL games across five clubs. Born in Wollongong in 1981, he began playing for St George Illawarra in 2003 before joining South Sydney midway through that season.

Tandy, whose father was born in Birmingham, spent time in Britain where he played for five clubs including Doncaster and then Hull KR in the English Super League in 2007.

He also played five matches for Ireland in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup.
