Texas drivers are being pulled over and offered cash in return for DNA blood samples.

Police say the national survey is '100 per cent voluntary' but drivers claim they felt trapped and were 'forced off the road' to give samples.

Officers in the $8million National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) survey ask drivers to give a cheek swab for $10 or a blood sample for $50.

However, they also ask them to do a breathalyzer test for free but say the research is completely anonymous.Â

Driver Kim Cope says she was pulled over in Fort Worth despite telling the police she wanted to carry on her way.

She said she only did a breathalyser test because she thought it would be easiest way to get out of the situation.

She told NBC DFW: 'It just doesn't seem right that you are forced off of the road when you are not doing anything wrong.

'If it's voluntary, it's voluntary but none of it felt voluntary at all.'

The research by the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, in Calverton, Maryland, is being carried out in 30 cities over three years.

It aims to find out how many people drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Questions have been raised about whether the survey is constitutional.

Civil rights attorney Frank Colosi said the small print on forms handed to drivers shows breath tests are carried out before drivers give their consent.

It says that 'passive alcohol censor readings' are taken 'before the consent process has been completed'.

He told NBC: 'They're essentially lying to you when they say it's completely voluntary, because they're testing you at that moment.'

Forth Worth Police said its Traffic Division was coordinating with NHTSA on the research and apologized if any residents felt 'offended or inconvenienced' by the survey.

It has also launched a review into the way the research has been carried out to see if procedures were followed correctly.
