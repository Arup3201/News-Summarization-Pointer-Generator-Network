Gordon Ramsay’s contract to run the restaurant at Claridge’s hotel is not being renewed, it has been revealed.

His 12-year stewardship of the Art Deco dining rooms at the five-star Mayfair hotel will end in June after talks aimed at reaching a new agreement broke down.

The notoriously fiery chef is understood to have withdrawn from negotiations after becoming annoyed at the length of time it was taking to finalise a new deal.

He has run the restaurant since 2001 when he clinched the deal with his former business partner and estranged father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson.

Gordon Ramsay's time at Claridge's is coming to an end after a breakdown in talks about long-term contract renewal

The restaurant was rated second in London for 'most disappointing cooking' and fourth for 'most overpriced restaurant' in the Harden's restaurant guide

However, the five-star hotel's dining 
rooms lost their Michelin status in January 2010 a year after head chef 
Mark Sargeant, one of his most promising cordon bleu stars, quit.

After losing the coveted accolade, Ramsay said: 'We are very disappointed to lose the Michelin star, but we are going to work harder than ever to try to earn it back.'

The restaurant was later rated second in London for 'most disappointing cooking' and fourth for 'most overpriced restaurant' in the Harden's restaurant guide.

The Kitchen Nightmares star - known for his fiery temper - suggested the failure to retain its high ranking might be the result of a desire to offer more simple, cheaper, dishes to appeal to diners in the recession. 

But there was concern among diners that he might have failed to give the venture enough of his time - as he was appearing on TV shows and opening overseas restaurants at the same time.

Soon after Mark Sargeant (pictured with Ramsay) quit as head chef, the restaurant lost its Michelin rating

2008: Gordon Ramsay's Michelin-starred La Noisette at London’s Jumeirah Carlton Tower Hotel closed after less than two years in business.

Industry sources said La Noisette, run by former Greenhouse chef Bjorn van der Horst, had struggled and was particularly quiet at lunchtimes.

It suffered a string of poor reviews, many of which concentrated on the brown decor and low ceilings.

His contract to run the restaurant at London’s Connaught Hotel also ended in September of the same year.

2009: Ramsay admitted his business had teetered on the brink of administration.

He sold his flagship restaurant on Hollywood’s legendary Sunset Strip less than a year after its glittering opening. Business had become so slow that on some days staff outnumbered customers.

He also sold his restaurant in Prague – Maze at the Hilton in Prague’s Old Town – back to the hotel.

2010: Maze by Gordon Ramsay, in South Africa, closes after one year.

2011: Ends partnership with Verre in Hilton Dubai Creek; Maze and Maze Grill closes in Melbourne, Australia.

2012: Maze in Qatar closes after two years; Ramsay is ditched by his flagship restaurant in Canada - Laurier Gordon Ramsay in Montreal - after just six months.  

It is understood Ramsay finally 
withdrew from Claridge's after the hotel was apparently unable to decide on a new contract due to a shareholder dispute.

A spokeswoman for Gordon Ramsay 
Holdings said: 'We have taken the decision to close Gordon Ramsay at 
Claridge's in June 2013 following a fantastic collaboration over the 
last 12 years.

'We would 
like to thank all our guests for the amazing support they have given for
over a decade, but felt the time was right to move on to new 
opportunities and investments.'

Thomas Kochs, general manager at Claridge's, said yesterday: 'We thank Gordon and his team for the incredible dedication they have shown in making the restaurant such a success.

'We feel the time has come, however, for a new dining direction for Claridge's and we bid farewell to Gordon with best wishes.'

In 2012 it was reported that Gordon Ramsay would face competition from his estranged father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson.

Mr Hutcheson and his son Adam were 
said to be launching a chain of healthy fast-food restaurants called 
Scoffs, serving British tapas for diet-conscious office workers.

Hutcheson
and Adam, who used to be head of pubs at Ramsay’s restaurant group, 
expects the chain to grow to 20 to 30 restaurants within 18 months.

His adviser David Rawlinson said: 
'Chris and Adam have an incredible wealth of experience in catering and 
plan to roll out the concept.'

Hutcheson
was dismissed in October 2010 after Kitchen Nightmares star Ramsay 
accused him of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million 
from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising.

Ramsay also claimed that Hutcheson put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five-figure cheques to himself.

Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed 'monster' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages.

Their
feud was settled after Ramsay, married to Hutcheson’s daughter Tana, 
reportedly paid £2million in February last year to buy his father-in-law’s 30 per 
cent stake in the business.

After his rise to fame, it has been a difficult few years for TV chef Gordon Ramsay.

He reportedly paid his father-in-law £2million to end a long-running row over his business in 2012.

The pair went their separate way after Ramsay accused Chris Hutcheson of taking money out of parent company Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH).

He was even seen in an awkward QVC pitch, as he tried to sell the 'Nonstick Hard Anodized Dishwasher Safe 10-piece Cookware Set'.

Ramsay's fiscal 
situation hasn't been as healthy as it once was in the last few years, 
after he paid off a a tax debt in 2009 relating to his Plane Food 
restaurant at Heathrow’s Terminal 5.

Gordon Ramsay sold his restaurant in Prague - Maze at the Hilton in Prague's Old Town - back to the hotel in 2009

Also in 2009, he sold his restaurant in Prague – Maze at the Hilton in Prague’s Old Town – back to the hotel.

The father-of-four closed two eateries in Australia in 2011, waving goodbye to Maze and Maze Grill in Melbourne’s Crown Metropol Hotel.

Further troubles include a £1.1million court battle in New Zealand after pulling out of a number of charity engagements, citing personal reasons

Even wife Tana tried to help pocket some cash after agreeing to star on the fifth series of British Dancing On Ice, but soap star Hayley Tamaddon triumphed as the winner.

Ramsay’s rise to fame led from restaurant kitchens to Hollywood.

He began with Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, which won three coveted Michelin stars in 2001.

Then his empire expanded quickly, with Amaryllis in Glasgow, Gordon Ramsay at Claridge’s, and eateries in Dubai, Tokyo and New York.

From Royal Doulton to Kmart, from Argos to the QVC shopping channel, you are never far away from Gordon Ramsay-branded products.

All this helped Gordon Ramsay Holdings to a turnover of £4.8 million in 2011, although expenses and bad debts lead to heavy losses.  In that year he also opened a new restaurant in London.  In 2012 he opened four new restaurants in the US.

In 2008, the News of the World published 
stories claiming Sarah Symonds, now 43, and Gordon Ramsay had had a 
clandestine affair for seven years.

Mr Ramsay has always denied the 
allegations.
