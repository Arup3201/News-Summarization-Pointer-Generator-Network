'Poor': Sergei Pugachev, who was once branded 'Putin's banker', said the order has made it difficult for he and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy, pictured together, to support their home

A Russian tycoon exiled in London who is fighting a freeze on his £1.3billion in assets by the High Court has claimed he is now a 'poor man' who cannot afford to support his family. 

Sergei Pugachev, who was once branded 'Putin's banker', said the order has made it difficult for him and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy, to support their home.

Last year it was reported the couple, who have three children and own a £12million house, employ two housekeepers, three nannies, two drivers and a live-in doctor.

And Ms Tolstoy, 41, said it was hard to live on the £10,000-a-week allowed by the court.

Mr Pugachev, the former billionaire business partner of the Queen's nephew Viscount Linley is accused in Moscow of siphoning more than £655million in funds from Mezhprombank, which filed for insolvency in 2010, including $700 million in Russian Central Bank bailout money.

The 52-year-old former tycoon, who denies any wrongdoing, complained the freeze has left him unable to support Tolstoy who said last year it was hard to live on the £10,000 a week allowed by the court. 

'I can be called a poor man. I do not have money to support my family and my property, and this is more important than paying the lawyers,' he told Vedomosti newspaper in Moscow, blaming the arrest of his bank accounts and assets.

He said he has borrowed $5 million towards his $10 million legal bill, but was now unable to take more loans because his assets were frozen. As a result, he has dispensed with his lawyers.

Last year, his  socialite partner - a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy - said 'we are just surviving' on the £10,000 a week allowance.

The Deposit Insurance Agency in Moscow, which is taking the legal action, claim the 'statements of his partner Alexandra Tolstoy' about their lifestyle belie 'his declarations about financial difficulties'.

A source claimed his move to dispense with his British lawyers 'looks like a tactical trick and is aimed at making obstacles for English justice'.

Last week a London Court of Appeal judge ruled that Pugachev, also previously nicknamed 'cashier to the Kremlin', must disclose further information about trusts he uses to bolster his income.

'Sophisticated and wily operators should not be able to make themselves immune to the courts' orders,' said the judge.

Pugachev claims he is the victim of a 'politically motivated' asset grab by figures in the Russan elite of which he was a member before fleeing to London.

His property was 'expropriated by the state and by private persons', and sold at rock bottom prices, he claimed.

He also alleged in court that a senior Deposit Insurance Agency official earlier made 'a brazen attempt to extort money' from him, and threatened that 'he or his family could be physically harmed'.

In November, Interpol put Pugachev on its wanted list at Russia's request, with Putin's spokesman alleging: 'He built up huge amounts of debts and then ran away.'

Faced by the legal moves in Moscow, Pugachev in October blasted Putin, claiming all Russian businessmen are now 'serfs' under his total control.

'Today in Russia there is no private property. There are only serfs who belong to Putin,' he told the Financial Times, in a blunt warning over the collapse of regulated capitalism in his homeland.

'Now there is Putin and there are his lieutenants who carry out his orders - and all cash generated is put on the balance of Putin,' he alleged.

'The country is in a state of war. And therefore big business cannot live as before. It has to live under military rules.'

He alleged: 'If Putin says he wants to buy something, you cannot say that you do not want to sell.

'If he says 'I want to buy something' then you say, 'Thanks for saying you want to buy it, and not just taking it.'
