BIG BET: Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger bet that Facebook's shares would dramatically rise after its May IPO. They were right, if only briefly

Facebook's ill-fated shareholders can take solace in the fact that they probably didn't make as big a wager on the social network's stock as the owners of Instagram.

So far, the creators of the popular photo-sharing service have lost around $300 million - and with each successive dip in Facebook's shares, that amount grows even larger. 

Instagram was sold to Facebook in April for $1 billion.

Founders Kevin 
Systrom and Mike Krieger decided to take $300 million in cash and 23 million shares of Facebook's yet-to-go public's stock. 

At the time, Facebook stock was valued at around $30 per share. Facebook's initial public offering on May 18 valued the stock at $38 per share.

At the time, Instagram's big Facebook bet looked like a masterstroke, as those 23 million shares soared in value to almost $875 million, alone. That made the total deal closer to $1.2 billion.

Going Down: Since it May 18th IPO, Facebook's stock has plummeted from a high of around $42 on the first day to about $19-a-share at Tuesday's close of trading

The stock quickly soared on heavy trading to $42 per share, making Instagram's owners even wealthier on paper.

Then came the fall.

The
 stock subsequently tanked over the next three months to its current 
price of a little over $19 per share, registered at Tuesday's market 
close.

Based on those figures, The New York Times writes, the Instagram deal is 
now worth a total of less than $750 million, cash included.

Instagram's owners reportedly could have hedged their bet with some arcane financial techniques that would have compensated them with either additional cash - or more shares - should Facebook's shares fall in value following the IPO, as they ultimately did.

In fact, the paper quotes Factset Mergermetrics as saying that 80 to 90 per cent of such stock deals like the one engineered by Facebook to acquire Instagram involve such hedging.

With Facebook's stock hovering at just over $19-per-share, the total value of the Instagram acquisition has fallen in concert with FB's stock to less than $750 million

Smooth Operator: Between 80 and 90 per cent of mergers involving pre-IPO shares have built-in hedges that protect the seller if the buyer's shares plummet, as FB's did. The Instagram deal had no such safety net

Instagram
 was founded in 2010 by Stanford University grads Kevin 
Systrom and Mike Krieger.

Since then, the outfit has acquired 
an assortment of other owners through employee hires - it reportedly 
counts 13 people on its staff - and private stock sales to
 investment firms.
