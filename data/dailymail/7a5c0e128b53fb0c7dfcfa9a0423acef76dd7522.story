We can add 'paranoid conspiracy theorist expatriate' to pro-wrestler turned Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura's long list of job titles.

The former Navy SEAL said Tuesday that he's living in Mexico and moving from place to place 'so the drones can't find me' while giving an interview to promote his show Off The Grid.

The third-party 62-year-old was dead serious as he explained his reasons for leaving the United States to live and tape his online political program and said he now sees the country of his birth as 'much like East Berlin' as he gazes at it from south of the border.

'So drones can't find me': CNBC panelists scoffed Tuesday, but pro-wrestler turned Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura wasn't kidding when he explained why his Ora.tv show is taped in Mexico

'I’m off the grid. I move about with my TV show so that the drones can’t find me and you won’t know exactly where I am,' Ventura told a panel on CNBC's 'Closing Bell' as panelists scoffed.

The host asked if he was kidding and wondered if the comment was a hoax as he promoted the online-only Ora.tv show.

'I view the United States, today, much like East Berlin. And I’m off the grid,' he continued without answering the host's question.

The host pressed him to explain how he got a satellite uplink while remaining 'off the grid.'

Fixing the country by leaving it: 'I'm solving problems. I'm a job creator,' Ventura said. 'And I'm not only creating jobs, putting Mexicans to work, I'm stopping them from running across the border now and taking our jobs'

'As long as we have solar power and we can reach the satellite,' the fired MSNBC host said.

Ventura made it clear that his agenda is neither with the Democrats 
or the Republicans. On his show's blog, he calls them DemoCRIPS and 
ReBLOODlicans after the infamous street gangs.

'I’ve tried for 20 years to warn the country about the Democrats and Republicans, and nobody’s listening,' he said.

Ventura says he's instead fixing America by leaving it.

'I’m solving problems…I’m a job creator,' he claimed. 'Putting Mexicans to work, I’m stopping them from running across the border now and taking our jobs.'

Ora.tv, which is financed by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, also features a show hosted by Larry King.
