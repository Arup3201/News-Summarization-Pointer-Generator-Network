Quiz presenter Sandi Toksvig, pictured, has come under fire for her joke about Ed Miliband

BBC presenter Sandi Toksvig was attacked by senior Labour politicians last night for comparing Ed Miliband to a ‘terminally ill child’.

The host of the satirical Radio 4 programme The News Quiz was referring to the Labour leader’s eagerness to visit Barack Obama at the White House.

Comedienne Miss Toksvig explained that the meeting this month had been organised by his election strategist and former Obama adviser David Axelrod.

She then added that Mr Axelrod may have tricked the President into meeting Mr Miliband by claiming he was a dying youngster.

Labour’s childcare spokesman Lucy Powell – who used to be Mr Miliband’s deputy chief of staff – said: ‘It’s in incredibly poor taste. I don’t know what she even means by that. 

'I don’t want to be the sort of person who tells comedians what they can and can’t make jokes about, and listeners know the show is fairly close to the wire, but jokes about terminally ill children could cause great offence.’

Mr Miliband gave a speech on Friday – the same day that The News quiz was broadcast – railing against image-driven politics.

In it, he joked about criticism of his appearance, including comparisons with Wallace – the toothy, animated character from the Wallace And Gromit films, and comical photographs in the Press of him eating a bacon sandwich. 

Miss Powell added: ‘There’s lots of stuff they could have joked about which would have been fair game – Ed Miliband mentioned some of it himself in his speech on Friday – but I don’t think it warranted going to quite such a dark place.’

On the radio programme Miss Toksvig said: ‘Labour leader Ed Miliband had an informal meeting with US President Barack Obama in the White House this week.

‘The meeting was arranged thanks to David Axelrod, the Labour campaign strategist who used to be Obama’s adviser, who may or may not have wangled the meeting by tricking his former boss into believing Miliband to be a terminally ill child.’

Labour MP Steve Rotheram, who sits on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said: ‘I think it was in poor taste. But it’s for other people to judge whether they’ve gone too far.’

The Labour leader had a ‘brush-by’ with the President – when Mr Obama popped briefly into a meeting being held between Mr Miliband and a White House official.

They spoke for 25 minutes about Ukraine, Syria and Gaza, climate change and the cost of living.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The News Quiz is aimed at an adult audience used to robust humour and edgy satire from the team.’

The News Quiz and its panellists are regularly criticised for going too far. 

Last year, a comedian on the show called former Education Secretary Michael Gove a ‘foetus in a jar’.

Miss Toksvig also said that the Duchess of Cambridge ‘is not enough for me’, adding: ‘We used to admire women who got their place in life through marriage and having children, but I like to think we’ve grown up a bit.’

In 2011, the BBC defended her when she joked on the radio show that the Tories had ‘put the “n” into cuts’ during a piece on child benefit cutbacks.
