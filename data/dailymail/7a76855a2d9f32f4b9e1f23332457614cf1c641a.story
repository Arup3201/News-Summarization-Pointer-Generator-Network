Prince William, has joined the royal photobomb phenomenon after smiling over cyclist Chris Hoy’s shoulder while he posed for a picture.

The 32-year-old was following in the footsteps of his brother Prince Harry, who photobombed New Zealand Commonwealth Games officials in Glasgow - and they were so chuffed one of them made it their profile picture on Facebook.

The Prince gave a cheeky thumbs up in the background of a selfie taken by New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens, Sport Manawatu chief executive Trevor Shailer and Massey University Professor Emeritus Gary Hermansson.

Cheese! Harry photo-bombs Gordon Tietjins and Trevor Shailer

The three men in the their black and white New Zealand team kits leaned in with their arms around each other as the Royal popped up in the background in a white shirt.

They were watching the 800m women's swimming freestyle in Glasgow on Monday night, which saw Welsh swimmer Jazz Carlin win gold.

The Duchess of Cambridge was particularly keen to jump in when she found herself taking part in a rather unusual game involving three cans during a tour of the athletes’ village yesterday.

The rules, explained to her by a group of local children, were simple enough – you knock down the three tins with a ball before running into the middle of a square, rebuilding them and jumping over them three times.

Less simple, of course, was doing it in her Stuart Weitzman wedge heels and fitted Stella McCartney dress – but Kate, 32, managed it with panache and a big smile on her face.
