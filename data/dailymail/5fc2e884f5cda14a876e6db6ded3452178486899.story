Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell has started dating a South American mother of two as he awaits trial for child rape.

Blanca Fouche, 31, from Chile, said she had admired the actor, who plays mechanic Kevin Webster, ‘for a  long time’.

The pair have tried to keep the relationship secret but Miss Fouche confirmed she had been seeing Le Vell, who is accused of a string of sex offences, for a few weeks.

Miss Fouche, whose Facebook profile 
says she works in a school and was once engaged in 2009, met the actor 
when she moved in with a friend a few doors from his home.

They have been dating for a few weeks and regularly meet at his home or The Railway, his local pub in Hale, Manchester.

Le Vell – who has played Kevin Webster
in the ITV soap for the past three decades – split from his wife of 25 
years, Janette Beverley, two years ago.

Miss Fouche said: ‘I’ve liked him from a distance for a long time.

‘I’ve been seeing him for a few weeks. I always go to his place and I’ve been to the pub with him.

‘We’ve held hands and walked down the 
street, we’ve been careful, but we’ve not been hiding. It’s just that 
there’s been no photographers here. I don’t want to say  anything that 
might upset him. He’s told me not to say anything.’

Friendship: 'We've been careful, but we've not been hiding,' Ms Fouche said of her relationship with the actor

Over the past few weeks Le Vell has 
let Miss Fouche borrow his car while she moved house and the pair have 
been affectionate  in public.

Miss Fouche added: ‘I go to his house 
or we meet up in The Railway. He has a lot of friends. He’s a lucky man.
I don’t want to say anything that will upset Michael.’

The actor declined to discuss their relationship, saying: ‘She’s a neighbour and a friend. That’s all I’m going to say.’

Le Vell, 48, faces trial in September 
after being charged with 19 child sex offences – six counts of raping a 
child, six counts of indecently assaulting a child, and seven counts of 
sexual activity with a child. The 19 alleged offences all relate to one 
complainant and all took place between 2001 and 2010. He ‘vigorously’ 
denies the claims.

Le Vell, whose real name is Michael 
Turner, is on bail on condition he surrenders his passport, does not 
contact named witnesses and does not have unsupervised contact with any 
child under 14.

The father of two has not yet entered a
plea but has stated publicly he is innocent and will fight the 
allegations through the courts. He was first arrested in September 2011 
and questioned, but the  matter was later dropped.

This year the Crown Prosecution 
Service said it was in the public interest to charge him with 19 
offences after a review of evidence.

Le Vell, who last appeared in the Street on February 8, will not be seen in any more episodes until the trial is over.

He split from his wife a few months 
before the allegations were first made in 2011. He married childhood 
sweetheart Miss Beverley in 1986 after they appeared together in 
Coronation Street.
