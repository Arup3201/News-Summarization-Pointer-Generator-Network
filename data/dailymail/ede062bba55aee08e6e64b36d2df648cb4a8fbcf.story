'Shame': Glenda Hull 'could not live with the shame' after being sexually assaulted, brother Roy claims

A young bride-to-be was driven to suicide after being sexually assaulted by a BBC presenter she idolised, her brother claims.

Glenda Hull, 21, died in 1971 when she jumped off a 29-storey building 'completely out of the blue'.

It was just weeks after she went to see the BBC star at a conference in Manchester - before going for drinks and accepting a lift home, when she was assaulted in a car.

Last night, her brother, Roy Hull, 57, appealed for witnesses to confirm his suspicion about the presenter who is still alive.

He claims his sister could not live with the shame following her attack on a high road in the Peak District.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'As a family we have always been concerned that this man was responsible for abusing my sister â€“ an act which led to her taking her life. Now we just want to know the truth.'

'After certain stars were arrested and convicted I realised that a similar thing could have happened to my sister.

'My sister had no reason to kill herself and was happy with life.'

Ms Hull, who worked in the General Post Office in Manchester, had been talking about the star's event for weeks before, Mr Hull claims.

After the talk, she went for a drink with friends and the presenter, who had a home in the area.

He says that at the end of the week she went out with the same group then accepted a lift home from an unnamed man, who took her to Snake Pass, an isolated high road on the A57 in the Peak District.

Rushing home hysterical, she told her family he 'threatened to leave her there' if she did not perform lewd sexual acts.

Mr Hull is certain she confirmed his suspicion when he mentioned the star's name and she 'snapped', telling him never to mention it again.

He said: 'She was very aggressive and angry.

'There was clearly something there but I was simply disappointed.

'Mum and Dad tried to get it out of her but she would never divulge anything.'

Police reports say she was approached a few weeks later at work by a woman in a red cardigan.

Ms Hull looked visibly upset, went to the top of the building, and jumped off.

Mr Hull is convinced this woman has a connection with the BBC presenter.

The Hull family is now working with high profile abuse lawyer Alan Collins from Pannone Solicitors, whose previous work involves Jimmy Savile cases.

Mr Collins told MailOnline: 'One is hopeful that people's memories will be jogged. People may have known Glenda and think "well, what I know is inconsequential", but that may not be the case. This is about piecing together a puzzle, every bit of information is needed.

'This is a very distressing situation where a family have lived for years without knowing the full circumstances of their loved one's death.

'For us to help Glenda's brother, Roy Hull, we need to speak to anyone who might have seen or spoken to Glenda around the time of her suicide, especially anyone she spoke to about her meeting with a showbiz personality weeks before her death.

'We are certainly not accusing anyone of anything but there are questions that need answering to establish the truth about this poor young woman's death.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'We do not comment on individual criminal allegations. We urge anyone who has been the victim of an offence to go to the police.'
