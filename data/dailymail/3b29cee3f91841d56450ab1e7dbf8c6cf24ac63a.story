The Ford Mustang, America's classic sports car, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a sleek new design and plans to go global.

The iconic car, which has featured in countless films, including the 007 and Fast and Furious franchises, has been given its first makeover since 2005.

The new-look 2015 Mustang was revealed on Thursday at events in New York, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Sydney, Barcelona and Ford's hometown of Dearborn, Michigan.

'Mustang cuts to the heart and soul of 
our company and really represents our company at its best,' chief operating officer Mark Fields told dealers and employees in Dearborn.

The new model is due to go on sale in the U.S. next autumn and will be available in Europe and Asia in 2015.

Ford sells more pickups in a week than it does Mustangs in a month, but the company says the Mustang has the highest name recognition and highest favorable opinion of any of its cars.

And car companies count on beautiful sports cars to cast a glow over the rest of their lineup.

The Mustang's first full redesign since 2005 presented Ford with a tough task: update and freshen an icon without alienating its passionate fans.

'When you work on an icon of the company, it's a mixture of tremendous pride and honor and a little bit of angst because there's a lot of responsibility,' Mr Fields said.

More than 9 million Mustangs have been sold since 1964, and the car has more than 300 fan clubs around the world, including one in Iceland and one solely for owners of yellow Mustangs.

The first Mustang was revealed at the World Fair in New York, which Mr Fields attended as a three-year-old.

Farrah Fawcett drove a white one in Charlie's Angels, Steve McQueen raced a dark green one through the streets of San Francisco in 1968's Bullitt, and it also appeared in Diamonds Are Forever and Gold Finger.

The new car takes plenty of cues from the old. The long hood and sloping fastback are still there, as is the trapezoid-shaped grille with the Mustang logo from the original.

But the new car sits lower and wider, and the roof tapers dramatically in the front and back. The signature rounded headlights are smaller and set back under a  chiseled brow, while the traditional three-bar taillights are three-dimensional and tucked beneath the rear deck lid.

This new generation of Mustang has been engineered to meet international safety and emissions standards. A right-hand-drive version will be sold in the UK and Australia, and Ford will market the car more heavily overseas.

Ford design chief J Mays said that while international needs were taken into account, the design wasn't influenced by European or Asian sensibilities.

'The reason they love it is because of its American-ness,' he said.

Stephanie Brinley, an auto analyst with IHS Automative, expected modest overseas. IHS forecasted European Mustang sales would triple from current levels to about 2,500 in 2015, while sales in China were likely to remain low because two-door coupes aren't popular there.

Road trip: Ford hopes the Mustang will sell well on the international market

Coupes make up less than 1 per cent of sales annually across the globe, Ms Brinley said. But they're still an important car for automakers.

'It's an aspirational body style. It signals a sporty drive and a sexier product,' she said.

Ford hopes Mustang can become the top selling pony car in the U.S. The Chevrolet Camaro, which followed the Mustang to market in 1966 and was last redesigned in 2009, has outsold its rival for the past three years and is on track to do it again this year, according to Kelley Blue Book.

Aaron Bragman, the Detroit bureau chief for the website cars.com, liked the new Mustang but questioned whether it could beat the Chevy Camaro, which has a less retro-inspired design.

'Anyone looking for something a bit more modern is going to choose the Camaro,' he said.

Mustang buyers will have three engines to choose from: updated versions of the 3.7l V6, which gets a projected 300 horsepower, and 5.0l V8, with 420 horsepower, as well as a 2.3l EcoBoost four-cylinder that gets a projected 305 horsepower.

Ford will also offer updated six-speed manual and automatic transmissions. Final numbers for horsepower and fuel economy will be released later.

Inviting: The interior has brushed aluminum fittings and better quality materials than previous models

Inside, new options include blind-spot detection and toggle switches that adjust the steering, stability control and other settings depending on the road conditions. The interior also has nicer materials, with brushed aluminum replacing painted plastics.

Ford isn't saying how much the new Mustang will cost. The current one starts at about $23,000. A convertible version will also be offered.

Dealers at the Dearborn event said they were pleased with the new car.

'They captured what's distinctly Mustang but it's new and fresh,' Brian Godfrey, general manager of Pat Milliken Ford in Redford, Michigan, said.

When Gail Wise drove away from a Chicago Ford dealership in the spring of 1964, she didn't realize hers was the first Mustang ever sold. 

Ms Wise paid $3,347 for the car, and was happy to have a convertible. It wasn't until she was on the road, with other drivers honking and flagging her down, that she realized what she had.

'I felt like a movie star,' she said.

Fifty years and 9 million Mustang sales later, Ms Wise was on hand to celebrate the 2015 version of the iconic pony car. With her was the original Mustang convertible, which still sits in her garage.

Ms Wise was 22 and freshly out of Chicago Teachers College when she decided to buy a car to commute to her new job as a third grade teacher. She went to Johnson Ford and asked for a convertible, since her family already owned two other Ford convertibles.

'I thought I deserved a convertible,' she said with a laugh.

The manager didn't have any on the floor, but took her into a back room and pulled a tarp off the new Mustang. It was April 15 - two days before the car was officially supposed to go on sale - but he offered it to her anyway.

'It was sporty. It was perfect. It went zoom zoom,' she said. She got $400 for a 1958 Chevrolet she traded in.

Ms Wise taught for three years before getting married and moving to South Carolina with her husband, Tom, who was in the Navy. But they kept the car, which has been fully restored.

The car now sits in their Park Ridge garage in Illinois next to a 2013 Ford Escape. It made the four-hour trip to Dearborn on a trailer, but the Wises still take it on shorter journeys, including a trip last year that included a few laps on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

'It's incredible that it's still such a popular car,' she said.
