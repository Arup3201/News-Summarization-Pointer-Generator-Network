An abandoned dog was forced to undergo reconstructive surgery after her previous owners allegedly hacked off half her nose with a machete.

Five-year-old Fresa was found wandering the streets of Mexico City with half of her snout missing with surgeons believing it was cut off by a sharp object.

Neighbours who found the pet took her to the Santuario Milagros Caninos dog shelter on the outskirts of the city, after seeing she needed urgent medical attention.

The dog, whose name means strawberry in English, was found by neighbours wandering the streets of Mexico City 

The dog, whose name means strawberry in English, was unable to breathe through her nose and surgeon Jesus Paredes was forced to operate on her.

The three hour operation saw Fresa have her lips reconstructed using other flaps of skin, which also removed her protruding jaw.

The procedure also allowed her to be able to breathe through her nostrils again.

Fresa, who is continuing to be cared for by the shelter, is recovering well and has learned to drink water using her new lips.

It comes after last month when American Stephen McGarva spoke out about dogs being hacked with machete and abandoned in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

The 48-year-old, told of finding stray and abused dogs on the beaches of the island in his new book.

It is thought the dogs on the island are considered a plague to the local tourism industry of casino hotels, and many of the animals abandoned had been poisoned, hacked with machetes, burned to death, shot with guns or dropped off and run over.
