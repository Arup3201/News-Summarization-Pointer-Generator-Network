It's the sort of picture-postcard haven of rural tranquillity seen in TV’s Midsomer Murders – and indeed it has even featured in the series.

But perhaps the pace of modern life is finally catching up with the sleepy Watlington, as new figures reveal it is home to the worst drivers in England.

One in seven motorists in the tiny Oxfordshire market town have points on their licence – twice the national average.

Mind the trap: Watlington has been revealed as the home of the worst drivers in England

'Sneaky': But motorists in the town say they have been wronged by overly aggressive officers

But residents of the town - population 2,000 - are blaming local police for the unwelcome statistic. They say ‘sneaky’ officers hide behind walls and hedges with a mobile speed camera to catch them going just over the limit as they head out of the town’s narrow, congested streets.

Steve Drake of car repair garage Merlin Motors said: ‘They are extremely sneaky about it. The police hide on the corner so people can’t see them when they come round the bend. If you do things like that you’re going to catch people, and we do get a lot of it.’

DVLA figures analysed by The Mail on Sunday show that as of March this year, 493 of the 3,603 motorists in the OX49 postcode, which includes Watlington, had penalty points on their driving licences. This proportion – 13.68 per cent – is more than double the national average of 6.47 per cent.

It is thought that most of Watlington’s speeding drivers are caught going over the 30mph limit by a Thames Valley Police van parked in a lay-by on the B-road leading out of the town towards the M40.

Resident Jan Faulkner said: ‘The speed camera van is here almost weekly so people should have learned by now. I got caught once and I know they’re here.’

Ian Hill, chairman of the parish council, said: ‘Our problem is congestion. If people can speed they’re doing well.’

But vet’s receptionist Sarah Rigg said: ‘People just tear through like it’s a race track. It’s dangerous.’

That’s a view echoed by Oscar- winning actor Jeremy Irons, who became so concerned about lorries using his home town as a rat run between the M40 and M4 motorways that last year he became the patron of an action group.

Life in the fast lane: Sleepy Watlington is home to scores of speeders 

Other places where there are above-average numbers of motorists with licence endorsements are parts of Worcester, Uxbridge, Slough and Poole.

Across the UK as a whole, far more drivers in Glasgow have picked up penalty points than anywhere else, with experts again putting it down to enthusiastic enforcement.

Simon Best, chief executive of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: ‘While these statistics make interesting reading, in reality it doesn’t truly reflect the behaviour of drivers in those areas. It is more a reflection of police activity.’

DVLA figures also reveal that men aged 42 to 50 are more likely to have speeding points than drivers of any other age, while men tend to have more points than women.

Edmund King, president of the AA, said: ‘Men aged 42 to 50 are more likely to have points than younger drivers as they have had more time on the road to accumulate points and do higher mileages.

‘Generally we find that men tend to take more chances on the road than women and do more miles.’

Although most drivers lose their licences after accumulating 12 points in a three-year period, judges can allow them to drive if their livelihoods depend on it – and 2,304 currently have 13 or more points.

One man from Liverpool has 45 points on his licence, which he got for speeding and failing to disclose who was behind the wheel; a Warrington driver has 36 points for driving without insurance; while a woman from Lincoln has 34.
