Chris O'Hare got Great Britain off to a medal-winning start on the final day of the European Championships, taking 1,500 metres bronze in a race which Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad made up for the heartache of losing his steeplechase crown earlier in the week.

The controversial 29-year-old made headlines across the world on Thursday evening after bizarrely choosing to remove his top as he entered the home straight, sticking it in his mouth and waving to the crowd.

Mekhissi-Benabbad easily won the 3,000m steeplechase but, after an initial yellow card for show-boating, had the title stripped after Spain launched an appeal citing rules on clothing, shoes and bibs.

The Frenchman looked noticeably downbeat and run-down as he qualified from the 1,500m semi-finals, but was back to his normal, extrovert self in Sunday's final.

Making his move with 400m to go, Mekhissi-Benabbad raced to the line, beating his chest down the home straight to win the 1,500m gold in three minutes 45.60 seconds.

This time he kept his vest on at the end of a race which O'Hare managed to win bronze for Great Britain in three mins 46.18 secs.

Team-mate Charlie Grice crossed the line 12th having taken a tumble, while Ireland's Paul Robinson came home fourth. Ciaran O'Lionaird did not finish after taking a nasty-looking blow.

'I think I could have challenged Mekhissi-Benabbad if I'd have been closer to him in the final 200m,' O'Hare said after the race.

'His 3,000m steeplechase disqualification was silly regardless of his behaviour - he ran a superb race against a great field here today so fair play to him.

'This year's been a bit of a mess so this medal is a great outcome for me. I'm done with my season now, I'll have a few days off now and then get ready for the cross country season.'

Great Britain added another bronze to their collection shortly afterwards in the women's 4x400m.

As expected, individual world champion Christine Ohuruogu was left out in preference of the less experienced members of the team and they did not disappoint.

Eilidh Child, fresh from winning 400m hurdles gold on Saturday, handed the baton over in the lead after the first leg, with Kelly Massey not fretting when she dropped down the pack as Shana Cox also got the baton in first place.

Margaret Adeoye ran a fine last leg but was unable to sneak a top-two place, with France edging Ukraine to the line in a European-leading time of 3:24.27.
