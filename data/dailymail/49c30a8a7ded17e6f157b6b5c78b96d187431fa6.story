The man who was killed when he attempted to stop the shooting rampage of a couple inside of a Wal-Mart store in Las Vegas, Nevada, is being eulogized Sunday.

A service to remember Joseph Wilcox, 31, will take place at 2pm at the Palm Downtown Mortuary and Cemetery, in Las Vegas. It is open to the public.

Wilcox was a customer at the Wal-Mart when Jerad and Amanda Miller, a married couple who had just killed two police officers, entered the store on June 8. Jerad Miller was shouting 'the revolution's begun' and announced to the customers to leave.

Wilcox, who was carrying a concealed handgun legally, attempted to confront Jerad Miller. That's when he was shot from behind in the ribs by Amanda Miller, whom he did not see as he walked towards her husband.

The Millers had arrived at the Wal-Mart after fleeing from another shootout inside of a nearby CiCi's Pizza that killed police officers Alyn Beck, 42, and Igor Soldo, 32. The officers were inside of the restaurant having lunch when the shooters stormed in.

The continuation of the rampage inside of the Wal-Mart ended when officers surrounded the couple inside of the store, where Jerad Miller had built a makeshift fort out of merchandise. He was then shot in the head by his wife, who then turned the gun on herself.

Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie declared that Wilcox died trying to protect others from the murderous actions of the Millers, whose motives seemed to be rooted in anti-police, anti-government white supremacy.

After murdering the officers, the killers left a note stating 'The revolution is beginning', also leaving a swastika and yellow flag depicting a coiled snake stating 'Don't tread on me'.

In a Facebook post dated six days before the attack, Jerad Miller went on a rant that stated 'To stop this oppression, I fear, can only be accomplished with bloodshed.'Â 

Wilcox was at Wal-Mart that day to return a modem. He had been experiencing Internet problem, which turned out to be a a result of an error by his Internet service provider.

According to his family, despite the Las Vegas Police calling his actions 'heroic', Wilcox was a quiet man who did not always carry a gun. At one time, he had attempted to become a police officer.

'It hasn't set in yet,' Wilcox's mother, Debra Wilcox, told KTNV-TV in 
Las Vegas last week. 'I just know he's not coming home. I keep looking for him to 
walk in that door. But he's not ever going to do that again.'

'I guess I can tell you that I wish he didn't go into that Walmart. I wish he didn't. I'm glad he helped,' she told KVVU.

According to his uncle, John Wilson, Wilcox was between jobs at the time of the shooting and was looking 
for work as a web designer..

'He heard the 
threat to everyone and he was trying to stop it,' Wilson told the 
Las Vegas Review-Journal. 'He wasn't trying to be a hero. He was trying to do what
 he thought should be done.

According to the family, Wilcox rarely carried his handgun, much less frequently in the months proceeding the incident.
