Sir Roger Bannister has revealed he is suffering from Parkinson's disease, 60 years after becoming the first man to run a four-minute mile.

The former athlete, who went on to have a distinguished career as a neurologist, said he had been diagnosed with the condition three years ago but had refrained from speaking publicly about it until now.

The 85-year-old said he was now having 'troubles with walking' as he made the admission in a BBC Radio Oxford documentary to mark the anniversary of his famous run in the city, which will be broadcast today.

Sir Roger Bannister, the first man to run under a four-minute mile, has revealed he is suffering from Parkinson's disease

Sir Roger went on to have a distinguished career as a neurologist following his retirement from athletics.

His work as a neurologist led to a greater understanding of degenerative disease and disorders of the autonomic nervous system.

Decades of neurological training, clinical work and research at the National Hospital and St Mary's Hospital in London made him an expert on Parkinson's many years before he was diagnosed.

He said: 'I am having troubles with walking. Ironically it is a neurological disorder - Parkinson's.

'There's a gentle irony to it. I have seen and looked after patients with so many neurological and other disorders that I am not surprised I have acquired an illness. It's in the nature of things.

'I am being well looked after and I don't intend to let it interfere - as much as I can.'

He went on to say: 'Just consider the alternatives - that is the way I look at it.

'One of my pleasures in life - apart from running - has been walking. Intellectually I am not (degenerating) and what is walking anyway!'

Sir Roger broke the four-minute mile barrier on May 6, 1954, at Oxford's Iffley Road Track with the help of Sir Christopher Chataway and Chris Brasher who acted as pacesetters.

Brasher died in 2003 after a short illness and Chataway died of cancer in January this year.

Sir Roger's interest in neurology was one of the main reasons for his decision to curtail his athletics career after the 1964 European Championships.

In an interview with the Guardian in 
2004, Sir Roger said: 'I had always wanted to become a neurologist, 
which is one of the most demanding vocations in medicine.

'Where do you stop, after all, with the brain? How does it function? What are its limits? The work seems unending.'

Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurological disorder, characterised by a deficiency of  dopamine.

This affects the way the brain co-ordinates the movements of the muscles in different parts of the body.

The disease mainly develops in the over 50s.

About 5 in 1,000 people in their 60s, and about 40 in 1,000 people in their 80s have the condition.

The main symptoms are slowness of movement, stiffness of muscles and shaking.

These tend to slowly worsen with time although the rate varies from patient to patient. There is currently no cure, although drugs, therapies and surgery can control the symptoms.

He told the programme he believes there is much work still to do before a cure for the condition with which he has been afflicted can be found.

Sir Roger added: 'I know quite a lot about [Parkinson's] and have treated a lot of people with it.

'I am aware of all the research that's been done. I think it will take some time before there is a breakthrough. But the management and drug treatments are improving all the time.'

Four-time Olympic rowing champion Sir Matthew Pinsent took to Twitter to voice his support for Sir Roger today.

Sir Matthew tweeted: 'Such sad news about Sir Roger Bannister - diagnosed with Parkinson's. A gentleman and a scholar.'

Hundreds of other people added their voices to the wave of support.

Photographer Rich Clark said: 'Sad to hear that Sir Roger Bannister has #parkinsons He cured my father when he returned from Africa with encephalitis. #hero #gentleman.'

Josh Goodfellow, a bodybuilder with cerebral palsy from Boston, Lincolnshire, said: 'Sad news regarding Sir Roger Bannister. Suffering from Parkinson's disease. Will always be an icon in Athletics. He was part of a revolution.'

Professional golfer Ben Storey simply added: 'Roger Bannister, what a man.'

Following the announcement, Steve Ford, Chief Executive at Parkinson’s UK, said: 'An inspiration to so many, Sir Roger Bannister is a much-loved sporting legend and we are saddened to hear that he is being treated for Parkinson’s.

'One person every hour in the UK will be diagnosed with Parkinson’s, yet it remains a little understood condition and we applaud Sir Roger and his decision to speak publicly about his diagnosis at this stage in his long life.

'There are 127,000 people in the UK, who like Sir Roger, are living with Parkinson’s. Parkinson’s can be challenging to live with, and symptoms – such as slowness of movement or tremor – changing on a daily, or even hourly basis.

'Many people, with the right medication, continue to live a full and active live with Parkinson’s, but for some, it can be life changing and we hope that Sir Roger gets the support he needs to continue to live with this complex condition.

'We wish Sir Roger and his family all the best.'

The race to be the first man to break the four-minute mile mark captured imaginations around the world.

It had become the sport's Everest, as much a test of the human spirit as the body.

It was a spring evening in Oxford when Sir Roger Bannister wrote his name into sporting history.

The date was May 6, 1954, and the venue the university's Iffley Road track.

Supported by pacemakers Christopher Chataway and Chris Brasher and cheered on by an expectant 3,000-strong crowd, the 25-year-old medical student burst through the line in 3m 59.4s.

He had knocked an incredible two seconds off Sweden’s Gunder Hagg's record.

A trailblazer, the rest, including the likes of Sebastian Coe, Steve Ovett and Steve Cram, would follow his lead.

For Bannister it was a case of redemption after he finished fourth, out of the medals, in the 1500m final at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, the disappointment fuelling his ambitions in the mile.

He went on to win Commonwealth gold medal over the mile in Vancouver in August 1954, beating John Landy, who had taken his record two months earlier, to the title, and the man himself regards that success as a greater achievement than his world record.

His winning time was a personal best, 3:58.8.

He also went on to win 1500m gold that year at the European Championships in Bern before hanging up his spikes to focus on his medical career.

He became a distinguished neurologist, served as chairman of the Sports Council between 1971 and 1974 and was knighted in 1975.

Bannister was master of Pembroke College at the University of Oxford from 1985 and 1993.

It was that run from 1954 which made him a national hero, though.

The Iffley Road track is now named after Bannister and a blue plaque commemorates his performance. And it is an an achievement which has diminished not one bit over the past 60 years.
