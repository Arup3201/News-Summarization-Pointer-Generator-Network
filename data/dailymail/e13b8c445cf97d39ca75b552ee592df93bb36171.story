AirAsia once boasted that its well-trained pilots would never lose a plane days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared.

The budget carrier was forced into a humiliating apology and withdrew its in-flight magazine in which the article appeared last year.

The article sparked anger on social media after an AirAsia passenger posted a photograph of the text on Twitter last April, with some accusing the carrier of mocking the Malaysia Airlines tragedy.

In comments that will appear particularly distasteful in light of the disappearance of one of its own planes, the last paragraph read: 'Pilot training in AirAsia is continuous and very thorough. 

'Rest assured that your captain is well prepared to ensure your plane will never get lost.'

Distasteful: AirAsia was forced into a humiliating apology after an article in its in-flight magazine boasted that it would never lose a plane days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared. The article sparked anger on social media after AirAsia passenger Jimie Cheng posted this photograph of the text on Twitter last April

At the time, AirAsia Executive Chairman Kamarudin Meranun expressed 'deep regret and remorse,' saying the latest issue of 'travel 3Sixty' magazine was printed before MH370 disappeared March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. 

Mr Kamarudin said the article was a monthly aviation column prepared well in advance by a retired pilot, who had worked for both AirAsia and Malaysia Airlines.

'This is a truly difficult time for the nation and words cannot describe how I personally feel of this incident,' Mr Kamarudin said in a statement. 

'It truly saddens me that this article was released at such an inopportune moment. Again, I repeatedly offer my sincere apologies for any discomfort this may have caused.'

Mystery: The flight went missing from radar at 6.18am local time - six minutes after last communication with air traffic control - while travelling from Indonesia to Singapore with 162 people on board. Search planes spotted objects and two oily patches in the search area on Monday afternoon

AirAsia group CEO Tony Fernandes also echoed the apology.

'As soon as we were informed on Twitter, we withdrew. Once again, apologies. It has been a difficult time for all in the industry,' he tweeted.

Mr Kamarudin said at the time that disciplinary action would be taken against the magazine's editorial team.

The fate of the Malaysian airline remains a mystery several months after it vanished. 

It wasn't the first faux pas for AirAsia.

On the day the plane went missing, Fernandes said on Twitter that the aircraft's radio had failed and that all were safe, but later deleted the tweet. 

A multinational search and rescue operation is underway after AirAsia Flight 8501 vanished in air space thick with storm clouds on its way from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore with 162 passengers and crew on board.

Aircraft crews searching for the jetliner have seen oily spots and objects in the sea, but officials say it is too early to know whether either was connected to the plane.
