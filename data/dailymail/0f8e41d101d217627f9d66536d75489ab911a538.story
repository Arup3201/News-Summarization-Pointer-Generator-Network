Singer Sir Cliff Richard and Rolling Stones rocker Keith Richards are both British music legends but there's no mistaking their differences.

However, that didn't stop one Sky News Australia journalist muddling the pair up.

As detectives swooped on Sir Cliff Richard's £3.1million apartment in Berkshire, spending five hours searching for evidence after receiving a report of sexual assault on a boy in 1985, journalist Vanessa Trezise announced that Sky News had 'the latest on a police search of Sir Keith Richards home over alleged sex offences'.

Ms Trezise's Twitter followers quickly spotted her embarrassing mistake.

She then replied to one person who pointed out her error, saying: 'I think I am done tweeting while at the news desk during breaking news. Brain explosion and sleep deprivation. Sorry all.'

Ms Trezise said she was 'mortified' but appeared to be able to poke fun at herself as she retweeted comments from her followers.

One man, Troy Dodds, said: 'I'd say you might want to double check that name. Wow.'

Sir Cliff Richard's home was searched after police were told a teenager under the age of 16 was attacked in Sheffield at an event held by American evangelist Billy Graham.

Sir Cliff, 73, who is holidaying in Portugal, is expected to be interviewed by police within days and has said he will 'fully co-operate' with their investigation.

The journalist said she is 'done' with tweeting breaking news

Sir Cliff Richard owns a luxury penthouse in a prestigious complex in Berkshire, England. Police were said to be searching the property in relation to an alleged historical sex offence

He was said to be shocked yesterday when he learnt that police were searching his penthouse suite after live television images of the raid were beamed around the world.

Officers are expected to question the star as soon as he flies back to the UK. But he has accused police of leaking the raid to the media yesterday, saying he had no notice of the searches being carried out.

He also furiously denied sexually assaulting a schoolboy at a Christian rally.
