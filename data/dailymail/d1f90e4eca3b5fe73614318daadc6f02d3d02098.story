Pitchforks at the ready! Behind the perfectly pruned hedgerows of Britain's gardening community people are whispering.

And the hot topic is what will happen at this week's Chelsea Flower Show when the BBC's new presenter at Britain's most prestigious horticultural event bumps into his predecessor Alan Titchmarsh, who's exhibiting there for the first time in three decades.

Alan, who until last year had hosted the event for almost 30 years, announced he was walking out six months ago because the BBC was talking to another presenter about hosting its coverage of Chelsea - two daily programmes, one on BBC1 and one on BBC2, during the five-day show - which he claimed was his 'chosen profession and area of expertise'.

Monty Don ruffled a few feathers when it was revealed that he would be presenting this year's Chelsea Flower Show instead of Alan Titchmarsh

It turns out he was talking about Weekend's own gardening expert, Monty Don. Awkward.

While Monty's appointment has pleased the millions of fans who adore his many gardening shows and columns in this magazine, there's a section of the horticultural community who aren't happy.

They still regard him as an amateur despite his decades in the business. Alan, who's an ambassador for the Royal Horticultural Society and has certificates from the Hertfordshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture and Kew Gardens, is one of them. Monty, who has no qualifications in gardening, is one of us.

Fortunately Monty, 58, has had enough brickbats thrown at him in his long career to be able to laugh them off.

'If people want to be snotty about me, that's their problem, not mine,' he shrugs. 'I'd love to say to them, "Just get a life!" If they don't accept me now, after all these years I've been gardening, well...' he tails off.

'I always say come and look at my garden. Is it beautiful? Yes. Does it give pleasure? Yes. There are a few people in the horticultural world who have this rigidity; they say there's only one way to do something and if you don't do it that way you're wrong. But for me the end is to have a beautiful garden and it doesn't matter how you get there. I don't make shows for professional gardeners; I make them for amateurs because I am one.'

Monty will be presenting alongside  Sophie Raworth

Monty's been reporting on and writing about Chelsea for nearly 30 years. He hosted the show when Channel 4 had rights to the coverage for a few years in the late 90s.

So he wasn't overly surprised when the BBC approached him about taking over shortly after last year's extravaganza finished, even if it has put certain noses out of joint.

'It was the BBC's decision to approach me,' says Monty. He also insists he's a huge fan of Alan's, even though they barely know each other despite their parallel careers. (Monty also took over Gardeners' World from Alan ten years ago.)

'I've only met him two or three times and he seems a very pleasant chap,' he says. 'You'll never find anyone who's worked with him to have a bad word to say about him. He seems a decent and hard-working man and I admire him. I know we're pitched as rivals but the way I see it there is room for the both of us.'

Matter closed. Monty's just happy to be hosting the event, along with a true gardening novice, BBC newsreader Sophie Raworth.

'There's nothing like Chelsea anywhere else in the world,' he says, adding that the flower show does the two things it needs to do well brilliantly.

'For the industry, it's a benchmark, it's the gold standard that everything else is measured by. If you're a gold medallist at Chelsea you're the best. While for the public it's part of the British social calendar like Wimbledon and Ascot.

'The British are very good at this mixture of ceremony and love of the countryside, and it all comes together at Chelsea. Some American gardening friends who were here one year were staggered at how much attention is lavished on a show with flowers.'

In all the time he's been covering Chelsea, Monty has seen big changes; in particular in the amount sponsors are prepared to pay.

'It's not unusual for people to spend hundreds of thousands on show gardens and a few years ago one show garden crossed the £1 million mark.

Alan walked away from the programme that he had presented for 30 years after hearing rumours that Monty was tipped to takeover

The worry is that if Chelsea becomes too dominated by big money then you can lose the element of risk. People are afraid to try something new.

'But the people who run Chelsea are aware of that and a few years ago they introduced an area where young designers are given the chance to show off what they can do on smaller patches. We all know we need to encourage young people to come into this world.'

Monty's been gardening since he was seven. His mother, who had five children and also looked after her own mother who was suffering from Alzheimer's, would send her children out into the garden to save her sanity and also to grow fruit and veg that would feed the family. His father, a soldier, was often not around.

'There was a lot of work to do; wood to chop, coal to get. Until the late 60s we had no central heating or freezer; none of the mod cons we take for granted. Life was busy but it taught us how important it is to work hard.'

Gardening was always a hobby; in his teens he gardened for neighbours and worked his way through Cambridge University, where he read English. It never crossed his mind to take it up as a profession.

Monty has no gardening qualifications but he has been reporting on Chelsea for 30 years so has lots of experience

'If you're someone from my background, which is middle class, it's assumed you'll become a teacher or a doctor, or something like that. If I'd said I wanted to be a gardener it would have been seen as a wasted opportunity. Looking back, that's appalling.'

At that point he and his wife Sarah - who he met at Cambridge - had seen their jewellery company collapse. They lost their home and Monty had to go on the dole to keep the family - by then they'd had their three children - afloat. 'I had to start again from scratch,' he says.

He began writing about his first love, gardening, and then presenting. The jobs started rolling in and when he took over as the main host on Gardeners' World in 2003 he was the first amateur to do it. He worked as hard as he possibly could, waking up at 3.45am to fit everything in. 'Losing a house gives you a refugee mentality,' he says.

'You always think the rug is going to be pulled away from under your feet. There's a fine line between enjoying work and working hard and looking after your family and ensuring your family has everything they need; and overworking.'

It's a lesson he learned the hard way. In 2008 he had a minor stroke. First he tried to shrug off the symptoms, and even after he was diagnosed he tried to go back to work almost immediately but realised he just couldn't do it and had to give up Gardeners' World.

It's only in the last few years he's been able to get back to work properly; he started back on Gardeners' World in 2011, but only on the proviso that he could do it from his own garden, the glorious Longmeadow in Herefordshire.

But now he seems to be working as hard as ever; as well as Gardeners' World, which continues until November, and Chelsea, he's been presenting a Channel 4 show called Real Craft and is also filming a new BBC show called Big Dreams, Small Spaces, creating gardens for people with little space.

After that he'll make another BBC show, The Secret History Of Gardens, before a new series of his Radio 4 show Shared Planet, exploring the relationships between humans and wildlife.

'You always think the rug is going to be
 pulled away from under your feet. There's a fine line between enjoying  and overworking.'

'I'm working harder than ever but now I've learned to pace myself,' he says. 'My stroke was a warning shot and I'm careful now. I don't do things that are too demanding. And I've learned to relax more; I've got better at taking time off and turning the phone off and not looking at the email. I do yoga every day which helps with the relaxation and I've also learned to just not care about certain things. I've realised there are more important things in life than being on TV.'

The new relaxed Monty is a happier one. He's been plagued by depression since his 20s; describing it as 'great spans of muddy time' where he'd struggle to get out of bed.

Gardening was his consolation, but not a cure. For that he needed pills, light boxes and therapy. He seems to surprise himself when he admits his depression has been almost non-existent in recent years. 'I think with age you learn to manage your resources,' he says.

'I think not getting over-tired is very important. If you're doing work you like that helps. And I have a very good support system. I'm lucky I adore my wife. Every year our relationship seems to get better. I also feel happier in myself.'

A famously organic gardener - who often provokes anger from chemical companies when he suggests alternatives to pesticides in his Weekend column - he says he gets a lot of letters from readers terrified of plant diseases, but he advises them to ignore smaller problems and only worry about big ones. And that's how he now lives his life.

'In gardening, as in life, you should look at the bigger picture. It's all about balance. If you get the balance right, things will look after themselves.'

The Chelsea Flower Show coverage starts on BBC1 tomorrow at 5.35pm, then runs daily until 25 May, on BBC1 from 3pm and BBC2 from 8pm.
