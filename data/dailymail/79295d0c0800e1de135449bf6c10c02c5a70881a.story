Training a toddler to use the toilet can drive anyone potty – just ask Layton Kennington’s mother.

She only left her son alone for a moment, but that was all the 18-month-old needed to jam his training potty so tightly over his head it took four firefighters to free him.

Layton’s mother Leanne Urmston, of Bolton, said: ‘I was in the kitchen and he walked in from the lounge with the potty wrapped round his head.

Completely potty: Layton Kennington, 18 months, had to be freed by a team of four firefighters after he got his head stuck in his training potty

A woman firefighter cut away the blue seat with a pair of garden shears, while Ms Urmston, 26, distracted her son with some of his favourite toys.

The toddler was said to be none the worse for his ordeal.

'I was in the kitchen taking a break for potty training and he walked in from the lounge with the potty itself wrapped round his head,' said mother-of-three Ms Urmston.

'I just couldn’t get it off, it was so tight below his ears. He started panicking and then I started panicking.

'The potty seat was cutting into his ears.'

Ms Urmston said her son was stuck in the potty for around half an hour.

'My friend was over and she told me to call the fire service,' she said.

Struggle: Ms Urmston tried to pull the potty away from her son's head, but without success and with Layton starting to panic she called for the emergency services

'She was in stitches crying with laughter. Layton was getting upset and didn’t understand what was going on.

'He was proper stuck he was screaming, I didn’t know what do.

'A fire engine came quickly with four firefighters. I just wanted the potty seat off Layton’s head - by the end I was more upset than Layton.

'The firefighters were really nice to him. Afterwards we were all laughing but I was in shock for ages.

'Layton likes Fireman Sam but he was that shaken up - he didn’t see the fire engine.'

Layton's father Ian Kennington took to Facebook to make fun of the rescue mission, writing: 'Lol, can’t believe you got fire brigade out for that x x.'

And a friend of the couple, Nadia Urmston added: 'Lol! that’s one way to potty train.'

One of a kind: Firefighters who rescued the toddler said they had never been deployed to free a child from a potty before

Firefighter Neil Mercer, watch manager at Bolton Central Fire Station, said although he had been involved in all manner of bizarre rescue missions, he had never before been tasked to free a child from a potty.

'Layton got the potty stuck on his head and couldn’t get it off. Once we got there he was released from the potty within two to three minutes.

'I have never had anything like this in more than 20 years.

'It is the first potty over the head I have dealt with. Normally kids get their arms or legs stuck behind radiators - but not potties.'

Three fire engines were mobilised to rescue a teenage girl who was stuck in a swing in north London

Last month fire crews were called to free Sunny, a nine-year-old golden retriever, who had got her head stuck in a hole in a garden wall as she tried to greet a neighbour’s new puppy on the other side.

Her owner Shelley Jones, 22, found her in the garden of her home in Gelding, Nottinghamshire, and after she was unable to free the pet called the fire brigade to the rescue.

In December, emergency crews were called to free an owl, who they nicknamed Santa, from a chimney in Wellow, near Bath, Somerset, while crews in Durham rescued four students from Dean of Durham's roof in what was believed to have been a drunken prank gone wrong last November.

Three fire engines and at least twelve firefighters were mobilised to rescue a teenage girl who was stuck in a child's swing in Finsbury Park, north London, in September last year.

The large contingent of firefighters, who arrived in three separate fire engines, were eventually able to free her after removing the swing from its frame.

And toddler Isabelle Preece had to be freed after she got her head stuck in a 50p tractor ride at a garden centre in Donnington, Shropshire. Crews used a bar bending tool - usually reserved for rescuing people trapped in cars - to get her out of the ride.

Last summer, London Fire Brigade revealed last year that thanks to the popularity of the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey, they are increasingly being called out to free people handcuffed to beds.

Crews have turned out to 79 such incidents, and urged people 'always keep the keys handy'.

The Brigade has attended more than 1,300 incidents involving people being trapped or stuck, often in everyday household items, since 2010.
