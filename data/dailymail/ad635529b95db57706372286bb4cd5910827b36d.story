The stained glass windows give the biggest clue to its former life, after this Sunday school was turned into a spacious modern home.

The unusual four-bedroom property is on the market for £795,000 in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, following an extensive refurbishment.

Dating back to 1929, the three-floor property covers 3,500 sq ft and has retained various original features including 20ft-high ceilings.

The adjoining Grove Road Methodist Church is a Grade II-listed building constructed in 1896 for £5,675 with seats for up to 1,000 people.

The owner of the Sunday school has also bought the disused 6,500 sq ft church, and is currently renovating it before living there himself.

A 1909 Ordnance Survey map is said to show an attached Sunday school to the west, although this was rebuilt on a larger scale in 1929.

The home, which is a 15-minute walk to Harrogate train station, includes a front lawn and driveway accessed by remote-controlled gates.
