As you step off the plane in Malabo, a nurse stops you and takes your temperature. 

Another forces you to wash your hands with alcoholic hand gel, before a third questions you on which countries you've visited in the last few months. Welcome to the Africa Cup of Nations.

It’s a remarkable feat that this competition is taking place at all. It’s been just two months since Morocco confirmed that they would not be hosting the tournament, and only 64 days since Equatorial Guinea stepped in as the hosts.

Even for a country with the infrastructure already in place that would prove a tough task – and here it still feels like a near impossibility as the football gets underway.

While Malabo and Bata, the two larger cities, hosted games in the 2012 edition of the Cup of Nations, for Ebebiyin and Mongomo were less than prepared. 

The pitch in Mongomo, birthplace of the Equato-Guinean President Teodoro Obiang, now looks pristine, but it was a mess just a few days ago, and there can be little confidence about how it will hold up after 180 minutes of football on Monday.

And when the tournament leaves town, having provided the town with six group games and a quarter final, the 8,000 inhabitants will have themselves a 10,000 capacity stadium. Lucky Deportivo Mongomo.

Away from the stadiums, there are other major concerns. While Malabo is reasonably well-stocked with hotel rooms, finding a place to stay in Bata is proving a real difficulty, not just for the fans and journalists that have made it out here, but for the teams. 

Cup of Nations veteran Claude Le Roy, the Congo manager in his at his eighth tournament, branded it ‘unacceptable’ when his side arrived at their hotel to find there were no beds for seven of the party of 35. In Ebebiyin Tunisia turned up to find that the power had gone down. 

When it returned, three and a half hours later, the players discovered, to their disgust, that the hotel had no running water, no bed sheets or towels, no televisions and no soap.

In Mongomo, meanwhile, the four teams face drawing lots to decide who gets to use the one available practice pitch at any given time.

None of this seems to matter very much to the locals, particularly in Malabo where the Cup of Nations seems to have snuck up on everyone. 

Ask a taxi-driver if they are planning to go to any of the games and the most you get is a shrugged ‘maybe’. 

Travelling fans are rarely a feature of the competition, and despite the President’s attempt to boost attendances by providing 40,000 free tickets, it is hard to see how any matches, bar those involving the hosts, will come close to capacity.

The exception to the low-key build-up came from a group of Malian migrant workers, who, it seems, decided to take it upon themselves to make Malabo feel like a city hosting a continental competition.

As we sat in a coffee shop in the centre of the town on Friday, a cacophony of noise interrupted the city’s quiet anticipation. Around 150 Mali fans, clad head-to-foot in yellow, waving flags and scarves and standing on the back of six or seven pick-up trucks, screamed their support for their country. 

The convoy honked their horns loudly, bringing the traffic – difficult to negotiate at the best of times – to a complete standstill. 

For ten minutes we were treated to the noise, passion and colour one associates with African football – before the convoy moved on to greet their heroes at the airport, and calm again descended on the capital.

Against this backdrop, a tournament that is notoriously difficult to predict at the best of times, has become impossible to call. 

The conditions for the favourites Algeria, out in Mongomo, could prove a real hindrance to their chances, despite the incredible array of attacking talent they possess.

They kick-off their campaign tomorrow against Senegal, also blessed with a wide selection of forwards (despite the withdrawal of West Ham star Diafra Sakho), perhaps the best front-line in the tournament, but have struggled to find a tactical balance recently. 

With a strong but unpredictable Ghana side, managed by former Chelsea boss Avram Grant, alongside them in group C, and the much-improved South Africans, the group in the remote corner of the jungle could turn into a real scrap.

Two other fancied sides, Cameroon and Ivory Coast, have the benefit of being based in fancy hotels in Malabo, and playing all their games in the rather beautiful stadium just south of the city in Banapa. 

The Ivorians, however, for all their Premier League talent, looked woeful at times in qualifying, and a friendly defeat to a weak Swedish side this week does not suggest they have done much to improve. 

However, with Manchester City stars past present and future in their line-up, with Wilfried Bony joining Yaya and Kolo Toure, they have the firepower to go a long way if everything clicks.

But the most remarkable team based in the capital are Guinea, the squad whose presence is a constant reminder of what this tournament has accomplished, simply to be happening. 

As you drive back into town from the stadium, amid the billboards advertising flights to Bata and showing off the new mascot Chuku Chuku (a squirrel which looks suspiciously like a porcupine), one slogan is repeated constantly. 

‘Todos contra el Ebola’ – Everyone against Ebola. For the Guineans, who qualified against all odds while their country was ravaged by the outbreak, this will be an emotional tournament.

They are determined to make their country famous for matters on the pitch, rather than as a medical disaster.

It has become clear that 64 days is not long enough to plan and deliver a tournament of this magnitude. 

What is a relief for all involved, from CAF to the players, and certainly the fans, is that now, finally, we can stop talking about the preparations, and start talking about the football.
