Leaving court: Rolf Harris leaves Southwark Crown Court surrounded by family after the first day of his trial

Here is the full text of a letter read in court written by Rolf Harris to the father of one of his alleged victims in March 1997:

'Dear [the father],

'Please
 forgive me for not writing sooner. You said in your letter to me that 
you never wanted to see me or hear from me again, but now [the alleged 
victim] says it's all right to write to you.

'Since that trip up to Norfolk, I have been in a state of abject self loathing. How we delude ourselves.

'I
 fondly imagined that everything that had taken place had progressed 
from a feeling of love and friendship - there was no rape, no physical 
forcing, brutality or beating that took place.

'When
 I came to Norfolk, [the alleged victim] told me that she had always 
been terrified of me and went along with everything that I did out of 
fear of me.

'I
 said 'Why did you never just say no?'. And [the alleged victim] said 
how could she say no to the great television star Rolf Harris.

'Until she told me that, I had no idea that she was scared of me.

'She laughs in a bitter way and says I must have known that she has always been scared of me. I honestly didn't know.

'[The
 alleged victim] keeps saying that this has all been going on since she 
was 13. She's told you that and you were justly horrified, and she keeps
 reiterating that to me, no matter what I said to the contrary.

'She
 says admiring her and telling her she looked lovely in her bathing suit
 was just the same as physically molesting her. I didn't know. Nothing 
took place in a physical way until we had moved to Highlands. I think 
about 1983 or 84 was the first time.

'I can pinpoint a date was 1986, because I remember I was in pantomime at Richmond.

'When
 I see the misery I have caused [the alleged victim] I am sickened by 
myself. You can't go back and change things that you have done in this 
life - I wish to god I could.

'When
 I came to Norfolk, spent that time with [the alleged victim] and 
realised the enormity of what I had done to [the alleged victim], and 
how I had affected her whole life, I begged her for forgiveness and she 
said 'I forgive you'.

Going home: Harris, who denies all of the charges, is pictured climbing into a vehicle following his day at court

Case: Harris, 84, faces a total of 12 counts of indecent assault on four alleged victims between 1968 and 1986

'Whether she really meant it or not, I don't know. I hope she did, but I fear she can never forgive me.

'I
 find it hard to like myself in any way, shape or form. And as I do 
these Animal programmes, I see the unconditional love that dogs give to 
their owners and I wish I could start to love myself again.

'If
 there is any way that I could atone for what I have done I would 
willingly do it. If there is a way I can start to help [the alleged 
victim] to heal herself, I would willingly do it.

'With
 your permission I'll phone you in a week to talk to you. If you hang 
up, I will understand, but I would like to talk to you to apologise for 
betraying your trust and for unwittingly so harming your darling [the 
alleged victim].

'I know that what I did was wrong but we are, all of us, fallible and oh how I deluded myself.

'Please forgive me, love Rolf.

'Please
 forgive me for what must have been the most insensitive thing in your 
eyes - sending the book for Christmas. Alwen knows nothing about all 
this - at the time - and rather than tell her I signed the book and 
wrote the platitudes with sinking heart.

'Forgive me.'Â
