A brilliant nuclear scientist working at the Cern nuclear laboratory was today sentenced to five in prison for plotting attacks on behalf of Al-Qaeda

Adlene Hicheur, who is French and from an Algerian background and who studied in England, was arrested in 2009 after police intercepted emails he sent to the Islamic terrorist organisation.

Judges sitting at Paris Correctional Court said the 35-year-old should serve five years, with one suspended.

Hicheur has been on remand for two-and-a-half years since his arrest in October 2009, when he was a researcher at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), a complex studying the start of the universe - or the 'Big Bang'.

Prosecutor Guillaume Portenseigne said Hicheur had used his privileged position to act as a 'technical advisor for terrorist attacks', keeping in regular contact with Al-Qaeda operatives by email.

'I see lots of confusion and inaccuracies,' said Hicheur, referring to evidence which was mainly written in Arabic.

'The police interpreter has done a good job to make me look indefensible,' he added.

Hicheur's trial comes in the wake of 23-year-old Mohammed Merah murdering seven victims in the south west of France earlier this year.

Both men grew up on French council 
estates, came from Algerian backgrounds, and have alleged links with 
radical religious groups who wanted to start a global jihad.

Referring
to Merah murdering French troops in two French towns, Hicheur's lawyer 
Patrick Baudouin said: 'Clearly, the events of Toulouse and Montauban 
don't appear to create the most favorable conditions for the trial of 
Adlene Hicheur.'

Mr Baudouin added: 'Hicheur must not become a scapegoat for a case he has nothing to do with.'

After
completing a thesis on high energy in 2003, Hicheur was a postgraduate 
at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, at Chilton, near Didcot, 
Oxfordshire.

Hicheur was 
arrested by anti-terrorist police in October 2009 at his parents' flat 
on an estate on the outskirts of Lyon, in eastern France - close to 
CERN, which straddles the Franco-Swiss border.

Detectives
and security agents found masses of Al-Qaeda literature at his own flat
nearby, including advice on how to carry out terrorist crimes.

Hicheur
had also been corresponding by email with Mustapha Debchi, a known 
member of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) based in Algeria.

On March 1, 2009, Hicheur wrote an email to Debchi proposing 'possible targets in Europe, and particularly in France.'

On March 10, Hicheur sent another saying: 'Concerning the subject of targets - they differ depending what you want to achieve following the hits.

'For example: if it's about punishing the state because of its military activities in Muslim countries like Afghanistan, then it should be a purely military objective.

'For example - the air base at Cran-Gevrier, near Annecy, in France. This base trains troops and sends them to Afghanistan.'

Debchi wrote to Hicheur in June 2009, and asked: 'Do not beat around the bush: are you prepared to work in a unit becoming active in France?'

Hicheur replied on June 6: 'Concerning your proposal, the answer is of course YES..'

Prosecutors said the email exchanges 'crossed the line of simple debate on political or religious ideas and entered the sphere of terrorist violence.'

Hicheur has been on remand in a high-security jail since his arrest, but deniesd the charge of plotting terrorist.
