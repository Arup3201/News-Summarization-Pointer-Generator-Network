Since the dawn of man, the stars above us have inspired endless wonder and intrigue.

From the earliest imaginings of what 'the heavens' were made up of to NASA's latest Curiosity Rover mission on Mars, an unquenchable thirst to conquer, or at least understand, space has pervaded mankind's time on Earth.

Now, a new exhibition has brought together more than a hundred awe-inspiring images of space which straddle the line between science and art.

The first glimpse of the far side of the Moon, photographed from the Soviet Lunar 3 spacecraft in 1959

This photograph was taken during one of five expeditions sent by the Royal Observatory at Greenwich to observe the transit of Venus of December 9, 1874

Starting with Galileo, the first person to look at the stars through a telescope, Visions of the Universe charts the development of astronomical imaging.

The exhibition, held at the National Maritime Museum, in Greenwich, London, reveals the role astronomers have played in pushing forward the technology of cameras and telescopes, which means we are now able to see the weather on distant planets and look beyond the Milky Way into galaxies beyond.

Among the images on show is a photograph taken during one of five expeditions sent by the Royal Observatory at Greenwich to observe the transit of Venus of December 9, 1874.

Astronomers were sent to Egypt, Hawaii, New Zealand and islands in the Indian Ocean. Many used photographic plates to record their observations accurately.

Meanwhile, a drawing of the minute structure of the solar surface by Samuel Pierpont Langley, in 1873, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, also features.

The images also chart the technological advances through the 20th and 21st centuries, showcasing the first glimpse of the far side of the moon and pictures taken by Neil Armstrong in 1969 all the way up to the latest images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin on the Moon: On 20 July 1969 Buzz Aldrin became the second man to set foot on the Moon. This picture was taken by mission commander Neil Armstrong close to the landing site

Earthrise: One of the most iconic views of planet Earth, taken from the Apollo 11 spacecraft as it orbited the Moon in 1969

Bright-layered rock deposits with evidence of ancient water: From orbit, just a few hundred kilometres above the surface, spacecraft like NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal evidence of water in the distant Martian past

Visitors to the exhibition, which opens on Friday, June 7, will be able to take a visual trip through the solar system featuring images of the moon, the Sun, the planets and deep space, before coming back to Earth to a selection of images that reflect our fascination with the night sky.

With views of the dazzling aurora on the surface of Saturn, the spectacular clouds of colourful dust in which new stars are forming thousands of light years away, and the dizzying sight of Earth as seen from the International Space Station, the exhibition celebrates the aesthetic beauty of space photography as well as the scientific discoveries that advances in technology have allowed.

The photographs on display include the latest cutting edge images captured by NASA, the Russian space programme and some of the greatest telescopes in the world, as well as highlights from the last four years of the Royal Observatory’s highly successful Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition.

The Crab Nebula, taken from the Hubble Space Telescope in 2005, is the debris from a 'supernova' explosion

The Butterfly Nebula, taken from the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. The death of a star very much like the Sun allows us to glimpse our own distant future

Orion Deep Wide Field: The three bright stars on the left in this image are the stars of Orion's Belt. Although part of a familiar constellation, a view such as this can never be seen with the naked eye

Andromeda Galaxy: Continuing improvements in telescope and photographic technology allow 21st-century amateur astronomers to image galaxies in detail that would have astounded Edwin Hubble

This image of Saturn's rings, taken from the Cassini orbiter spacecraft in 2005, shows how image-processing techniques can be used to convey scientific information which could not otherwise be seen

Organisers have said the centrepiece of the exhibition is the 'Mars Window' - a 13 metre by four metre curved wall onto which the latest images beamed back by NASA’s Mars Curiosity Rover are projected.

The effect aims to create the impression of looking through a giant window out onto the rocky Martian landscape. It is the first time a museum exhibition has used images from a current space mission in this way. 

Other photographic highlights on display include the first astronomical image ever taken; Edwin Hubble’s 1923 photograph which confirmed the existence of galaxies beyond our own; the 1969 image of the first human to walk on the moon; and the astronomical photograph which helped to prove the General Theory of Relativity.

Star Trails, Blue Mountains, taken in Australia by Ted Dobosz, winner of the 'Earth and Space' category, Astronomy Photographer of the Year, 2009, using a Canon 40D DSLR camera with Tamron 17-mm lens
