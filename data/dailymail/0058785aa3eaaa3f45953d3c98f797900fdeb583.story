I am lying on my back in a field amid hundreds of people in stretchy Lycra clothing at the Wanderlust yoga festival in Vermont – imagine a mini Glastonbury, but with added headstands. And there are tears streaming down my face.

The class I’ve just finished was titled Radiant Body: Your Practise As Medicine. But if I was expecting a practical guide to easing physical aches and pains, it’s evidently aimed more at emotional therapy.

Moments earlier, when the teacher asked us to visualise an area of our life that needed healing, a vivid impression of the ex-boyfriend I hadn’t thought about for years appeared in my mind, and with it a profound realisation that I never properly dealt with the fallout from that destructive relationship.

Mind over mats: A mass yoga class at a previous Wanderlust festival - far from the muddy rock events of the UK

The waterworks began when we moved into a deeper stretch and it became obvious that getting over it once and for all would mean practising some forgiveness and gratitude – it was time to forgive myself for allowing it to happen, and to thank him for showing me what I didn’t want from a relationship.

Yoga originated in India, but has become mainstream. And much to the distaste of the purists, all sorts of styles of yoga have been developed to suit different bodies and tastes. It means there is a class  for everyone now.

I have always approached yoga from a purely athletic standpoint, seeing it mainly as an opportunity for a good stretch.

But on my mat in Vermont, I experience a yogic awakening. So this is the mind, body and spirit effect that people talk about. And judging from the sobs and sniffles on the mats around me, I’m not the only one.

The Wanderlust festival (wander 
lustfestival.com), now in its third year, travels to six different sites
in the United States during the summer (it also went to Chile this 
year), and is an example of how mainstream yoga has become in America.

Mind bent: Ruby Warrington has fallen for traditional yoga after attending Wanderlust

It’s estimated that 20 million people in the States now regularly hit the mat, while spending on yoga related products reached £17 billion last year – up 87 per cent in five years.

In the UK, as many as a million people regularly do yoga, and September is National Yoga Month when more than 2,200 studios will offer a week of free trial classes.

There are myriad studies to show yoga can help with everything from osteoarthritis and asthma to stress and chronic lower back pain. It has also been proven to be useful during pregnancy and labour, and in improving cognitive function and perceived stress during the menopause.

Not to mention the lengthening, tightening effect it has on your body. A photographer who specialises in nudes once told me that without doubt, the best bodies she saw naked were the yoga bodies.

If I was expecting a dreadlocked crowd of blissed-out hippies, the Vermont event seemed mainly to attract affluent New Yorkers decked out in trendy yoga label Lululemon Athletica (which plans to launch in the UK later this year).

I even ate lunch next to a couple who had brought a nanny to watch the kids while they took back-to-back classes.

Meanwhile, my lunch might have been a vegan, gluten-free pizza, but evening entertainment also included ‘Winederlust’ – a bar serving organic and biodynamic wine – and a lavish, four-course ‘farm-to-table’ feast (with steak and home-made limoncello), tickets for which cost $85 each and sold out way ahead.

As for my teary experience on the mat, once the floodgates had opened, I could barely get through a class without crying.

Take the Detox Flow Yoga session, taught by a woman many regard  as the high priestess of yoga, Seane Corn.

As she lectured a 400-strong class of mildly hung-over yogis about how we often use alcohol and other substances as an emotional crutch, it became very clear I do exactly that – and that my love affair with booze began when I needed Dutch courage to extricate myself from the aforementioned bad romance. Cue more waterworks.

My favourite kind of yoga has always been Bikram, the insanely hot class that makes you sweat buckets and gives you muscles like Popeye, because to me it felt like a ‘proper’ workout.

But after my weekend of healing, I can finally see the point of more gentle, breathing-focused schools of yoga.

The following weekend, feeling nostalgic for summertime back the UK, my husband and I catch up with friends who regale us with tales of the rock festivals they’ve been to.

But I can’t stop thinking about a very different kind of festival – and what feels like only the beginning  of my yogic journey.

Iyengar: Suitable for all ages and abilities and uses equipment such as foam blocks and straps. Improves balance and body strength; a study of 90 people with chronic lower-back pain found less disability,  pain and depression after six months.

Ashtanga: Fast- moving, demanding yoga comprising six sequences of poses, which become progressively harder – participants advance as their skill develops. Each pose is linked with one breath. Said to develop cardiovascular fitness and body strength. A small study of children found they lost weight and felt less anxiety after 12 weeks of ashtanga yoga.

Kundalini: The ‘yoga  of awareness’, it combines breathing exercises, postures, chanting mantras and meditation. Focus on relaxation and self-awareness.

Bikram: A class in a sauna-like room where attendees go twice through a series of 26 postures. Said to burn up to 600 calories a class.  A 2012 study discovered that bikram was associated with better sleep, while other research found it increased strength and flexibility and decreased weight.

Hatha: An umbrella  term – Hatha means a gentle, traditional approach with basic postures, meditation and breathing exercises. Cuts stress, improves breathing and builds back strength.
