A romantic couple stunned their friends and family by inviting them to a made-up movie premiere at a cinema - which turned out to be their wedding day.

Darren Yates, 40, told 100 of their guests that he had a cameo role in a Hollywood blockbuster called Match Made In Heaven, only for the attendees to arrive at the cinema to find it was the couple's wedding ceremony.

The groom and his fiancee Katherine Yates, 34, were so determined to fool their friends and family they even designed fake posters and a voiceover trailer for the fictional film and posted VIP tickets for the screening.

Darren and Katherine Yates surprised their friends by inviting them to the cinema and then getting married

But guests were left gobsmacked when they took their seats in the Electric Cinema in Birmingham on Saturday, 13 December, and discovered that they were going to watch them get hitched.

Instead of the Hollywood movie, they were shown a two-minute short film called Haribo Man which Darren and Katherine had filmed over the past month.

Its star Darren is chased by dogs before hitching a lift in a Lamborghini before switching to Del Trotter's three-wheeler van as he races to propose to Katherine with a Haribo-sweet ring. 

The already stunned guests were then shocked once more when a registrar stood up and the UK's oldest working cinema turned into a wedding venue. 

Darren and Katherine, both from King's Norton, Birmingham, walked down the makeshift aisle to the song Best Day Of My Life by rock band American Authors and tied the knot in front of their friends and family.

The couple decided to surprise their loved ones by getting married exactly a year to the day after they first met at work.

The couple sent out invitations claiming that Darren had a cameo role in a new flick Match Made In Heaven

Darren, a communications and engagement officer, met Katherine, who works as a quality and compliance officer, through their job at West Midlands Police.

The prankster groom says that no details were overlooked when it came to fooling their guests.

'We sent out tickets and a VIP letter and they thought I had a cameo role in a Universal Pictures film.

'I even got a guy in America to do a voiceover for me so people thought it was all genuine. 

'We were upstairs hiding but after my little film had been played the registrar stood up and said "it's now going to be a wedding".' 

Guests saw a film called The Haribo Man in which Darren proposes to Katherine with a jelly sweet ring

Darren added that the surprise element to their wedding helped make their day extra memorable for them both. 

'Everybody gasped and then we walked out and they were all clapping, it was just fantastic.

'I know people have proposed in a cinema before but I don't think anybody has surprised their guests and had a spontaneous wedding,' he said.

Katherine was also in on the secret which the couple first started planning six months ago in the summer.

The besotted bride added that the ceremony had been everything she had hoped for and more. 

'It was a wonderful day, I had an idea in my mind of what it was going to be like but just exceeded everything I thought it would be. 

'It was just magical and getting the reaction off people who were there and didn't have a clue was amazing.

'The fact that it was such a surprise for everything added to the magic of the day. 

Darren and Katherine said that they wanted to skip the engagement and just go straight to the wedding

'We just wanted people to come and enjoy themselves rather than spend money on a dress and hat.'

The couple, who are expecting their first child together in April, spent several weekends making Haribo Man which was filmed across Birmingham.

Darren, who has a daughter Emily, 11, from a previous marriage, said: 'We were thinking about getting engaged and Katherine said forget getting engaged, let's just get married.

'People who were there said it was the best wedding they had ever been to which was just what we wanted.'

Katherine, who has a son Liam, 12, from a previous relationship, added that Darren's creative input had helped make the day perfect.

'We were throwing some ideas together and Darren is a genius when it comes to creative things like this.

'It just went from strength to strength and we decided to do it as a surprise which went down so well with everyone.'

After the unconvential nuptials,  the couple had a more traditional evening party at a converted barn in Sutton Coldfield, West Mids.
