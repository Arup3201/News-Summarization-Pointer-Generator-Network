The mother of a seven-year-old girl recovering from cancer could face prison after allowing her to skip seven days of school.

Kerry Capper, 25, said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill – fearing the disease had returned.

In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy.

The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups.

Between
 January and March this year Miss Capper kept her at home for a total of
 seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget 
Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham.

Now
 the mother has been summoned to appear before magistrates for failing 
to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’. If she does 
not pay Miss Capper, of Erdington in Birmingham, could face a 
three-month jail sentence.

Yesterday
 she said: ‘Libby woke up saying that she’s got a sore stomach and I get
 scared. I want to keep my eye on her and I kept her off school on those
 days and they have sent me to court because of it.

‘They
 should give consideration of what I went through as a mother and when 
she does say she’s ill I get really scared because we did nearly lose 
her.’

But Birmingham 
council said no reason was given for the time off and that Miss Capper 
had failed to attend meetings to discuss the situation.

The
 unemployed mother claims she had run out of credit on her mobile phone 
so was unable to inform the school that Libby – who had an 85 per cent 
attendance record prior to the fine – would be absent.

She
 also says she went in on the wrong day after being invited to a meeting
 by the school and accidentally missed a second date to explain the time
 off. Miss Capper added: ‘I said, “Apologies, I’ve missed that 
appointment”.

‘The teacher 
just said, “I’m sorry, Mum, it’s getting sent to court now”. Then I got a
 penalty notice of £60. But I couldn’t afford to pay that at that time.’
 The fine rises to £120 if not paid within 21 days.

Miss Capper’s legal team, Birmingham-based Glaisyers, said the council was being ‘heavy-handed and inflexible’.

Education: The council claims Kerry Capper never gave staff at Paget Primary School (pictured) in Birmingham a reason for her daughter Libby's absences, and then failed to attend a meeting to discuss the issue

But the authority said it took a ‘robust stance’ on unexplained school absences.

A
 council spokesman said the school had invited Miss Capper to a meeting 
‘to talk through any issues and concerns’, adding: ‘When there was still
 no response a penalty notice was issued and when this was not paid the 
matter was sent to magistrates.’

Miss Capper, who will appear before Birmingham magistrates on September 5, said she is  worried about the outcome.

Her
 solicitor Claire Riches said: ‘We feel strongly that the council should
 not have brought this case against Kerry. Every time Libby would feel 
unwell her symptoms were like the time she was diagnosed with cancer and
 Kerry wanted to keep an eye on her in case the cancer had returned.’

The
 Government’s change to the law on school absences, in September last 
year, was designed to stop families taking pupils on term-time holidays.

But some parents have been penalised for children missing class to attend important events or medical appointments.

In
 May, Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, were warned they 
could face a £1,000 fine if they took their ten-year-old daughter out of
 school for her grandfather’s funeral.

Hanbury’s Farm Primary School, Tamworth, told the couple the reason did not amount to ‘exceptional circumstances’.
