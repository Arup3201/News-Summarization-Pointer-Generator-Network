Louis Moore, 28, was found dead in his bedroom by his brother, professional footballer Byron Moore, 25, hours after he signed for Port Vale FC

A footballer has told how he signed a contract with a professional club before going home and finding his brother hanged in his bedroom.

Byron Moore, 25, received a text from his brother, Louis, 28, saying 'I want to be alone, it's over' as he signed for Port Vale FC on Thursday.

The professional footballer rushed back from the Vale Park stadium to his brother's house in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, with his mother, Jannice Mountford, 50, but it was too late.

When Mr Moore didn't answer the door, the pair let themselves in and found the former athletics star hanged in his bedroom.

They called emergency services to the house, but nothing could be done to save the promising athlete who'd represented Great Britain as a teenager before finding work as a supervisor at at gift company.

Today Mrs Mountford, 50, said: 'It was such a shock.  You don't expect to find your own son like that.

'We eventually got him down but it was too late.'

Mrs Mountford, a former Special Constable with Staffordshire Police, said her son had split up from his girlfriend six months ago, since when he had stayed in a lot.

She said: 'People can put on a happy face but you never know what they are thinking.  We had been away for a week and he looked after our house.

'He said he had put £5 on the electric so I said I would go round and pay him back.  I got a message saying not to come as he wanted to be alone.'

She said a few days later, she and Byron received another text 'that wasn't quite right', so they went to Mr Moore's house.

Mrs Mountford said: 'Byron was going in to sign for Vale when he got the text.

'We are just devastated beyond words. He was such a talented and popular man.'

Byron Moore, a former Crewe Alexander winger, said his older brother hadn't known he was signing for Port Vale.

He said: 'I'm going to dedicate each goal I score to my brother.  I will say a little prayer before the games - it's going to be hard but we have to be strong.

Devastated family: Jannice Mountford, 50, and her son Byron Moore, 25, found Louis Moore dead at home

Byron Moore had been signing a contract at Vale Park, home of Port Vale, when his brother sent him a text

'We were really close - we used to text all the time and I'd go round to his house to play Xbox. He watched me play at Wembley, and cried when I scored.'

Louis's father, Dennis Moore, 52, of Meir Hay, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 
'He was a great guy who liked to speak his mind. He always made you 
laugh - it's such a shame that he's gone so soon.'

And
 his grandmother, Norma Mountford, added: 'We used to bring him to 
athletics competitions, which he nearly always won. He was a lovely 
boy.'

Louis joined the City of Stoke Athletics Club before representing England and Great Britain in athletics.

He
 was part of the under-13s team whose 1997 record for the 4x100m relay 
race at Northwood Stadium remains unbeaten.  He also excelled in long 
jump, high jump and pentathlon.

After graduating from Staffordshire University with a degree in sports science he had aspirations to join the police and volunteered with Staffordshire's Special Constabulary for a year before work commitments meant he had to stop.
