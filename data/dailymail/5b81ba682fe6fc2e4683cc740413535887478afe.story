Lindsay Wixson may have starred in hundreds of high-profile fashion shows over the course of her five-year modeling career, but she's still rather prone to falling over.

The 20-year-old beauty posted a snap to her Instagram account this morning of her bandaged ankle; the result of 'walking off the end of the runway' at the Jean Paul Gaultier show yesterday at Paris Fashion Week.

The fall wasn't captured on camera, so it may have happened during a rehearsal, but Miss Wixson blamed the vision-obscuring 'bee-keepers' headgear she was wearing for causing her to lose her footing.

Occupational hazard: Lindsey Wixson, 20, posted a snap to her Instagram account this morning of her bandaged ankle - the result of 'walking off the end of the runway' at the Jean Paul Gaultier show yesterday

Un-bee-lievable! The fall, which happened at Paris Fashion Week, wasn't captured on camera and so may have occurred during the rehearsal. Pictured, Miss Wixson (upright) at the show which caused her injury

If the fall did happen during a rehearsal, it means that Miss Wixson would have walked the show regardless of her injury, only seeking medical attention afterwards.

She accompanied the photo with an explanation, stating: 'The result after walking off the end of #jeanpaulgaultier runway from my bee-keepers mask yesterday. 5 days wrapped.'

Fans from her 135,000-strong Instagram following have expressed their sympathies, with one commenting, 'speedy healing!' and another writing, 'get well soon gorgeous'. 

Luckily for the model - hailing from Wichita, Kansas and famed for her rosebud-pout and gap-tooth-combo - New York Fashion Week doesn't start for another two weeks.

Miss Wixson has already walked several shows in Paris this week; including Chanel, Versace, Alexandre Vauthier and Elie Saab.

Success! Miss Wixson did manage to avoid falling at last Sunday's Versace show (pictured), having slipped over twice on the designer's catwalk  in the past, once in 2014 and once in 2012

This is not the first time the teenager, from Witchita, Kansas, has fallen at a high-profile show. In fact, it's her fourth documented tumble. 

Her Bambi-legs last collapsed at Versace's 2014 Fall/Winter show, and before that, at the same designers' 2012 Spring/Summer show. 

And back in 2011, Miss Wixson made headlines around the world when she fell numerous times on one catwalk at Naomi Campbell's Fashion for Relief fundraiser in Cannes.

The performance this time was so dramatic that many believed she had fallen on purpose for effect, but Miss Wixson insists this was not the case.

Over she goes: Before that, she fell at Versace's 2012 Spring/Summer show (pictured) while wearing some admittedly tricky-looking heels

Sense of humor: Still, the industry favorite raised her arms in victory once she was back on her feet

Few girls could survive such a faux-pas, as a model agency insider once revealed to the Daily Mail Online. Indeed, our source admitted that falling on the catwalk can in fact be career-threatening.

'It's quite common for girls to be quietly dropped by their agents after tripping or falling during a show,' they said. 

'As far as the designers are concerned the model's job is to make the clothes look fantastic. That's compromised when she starts stumbling down the catwalk like a drunk. 

They added that many models lived in fear of falling on the runway, and often had tricks to avoid it happening.

Dramatic: The performance was so extreme that many believed she had fallen on purpose for effect

'I know girls who will do anything to avoid it, include asking for shoes
 a bone-crushing size too small to ensure there is no chance of their 
high heels coming loose half way down the catwalk,' they revealed.

'I came across one girl who carried sandpaper in her Gucci handbag and 
used it to rough up the bottom of her show shoes to give her extra grip.'

The source did admit, however, that the more well-known models were less likely to be affected.

'If the model has an existing profile and clientele then she will probably survive a few stumbles - look at Naomi Campbell.'

Luckily for Miss Wixson, who was bullied at 
school for her unusual looks, her clients appear to be highly forgiving.

Since making her debut, she has appeared in campaigns for Alexander McQueen, Miu Miu and Mulberry, among many others.

FALL COLLECTION: A HISTORY OF RUNWAY STUMBLES

Taking a tumble: A model went flying on the slippery runway at a Marc by Marc Jacobs show in February 2010

Slip-up: A Prada show in 2008 descended into farce when a last-minute decision to have the models wear little socks with their heels caused many of them to slip and fall across the runway

Naomi moment: Schoolgirl model Nina Porter, then 16, made an impact in more ways than one when she tripped and fell as she closed the Burberry Prorsum catwalk show in 2010

Helping hand: Ana Claudia Michels is lifted to her feet by another model after falling during the Blue Man swimwear show at Rio de Janeiro fashion week in 2011
