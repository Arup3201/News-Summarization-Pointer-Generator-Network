A woman who appealed for the Australian Government's assistance to help her flee Lebanon has mysteriously reappeard back in Australia.

Mahassen Issa said in July she had been contacted by Lebanese police who told her he she was facing adultery charges because she married new boyfriend Mohammad Awick in the Middle Eastern country having become estranged to her former husband Bassem Abou Lokmeh.

But now, three months later, Ms Mahassen is back in Sydney and has appeared at Bankstown Local Court, in Sydney's west, refusing to provide details to reporters over her alleged charge in Lebanon or how she returned to the country.

Mahassen Issa appeared at the Sydney court on Thursday over an apprehended violence order she took out against her estranged husband, Bassem Abou Lokmeh where she admitted that she was fearing for her life in Lebanon.

But when asked by reporters outside court whether she still felt in danger, she refused to comment.

Ms Issa was disowned by her Australian family after reportedly marrying new boyfriend Mohammed Awick in July, which reportedly led to the charges in Lebanon and forced her into hiding.

She said she was unable to leave the country because she was wanted for adultery and bigamy under Sharia Law after allegedly being reported to authorities by Mr Abou Lokmeh.

She sent a desperate appeal for help to the Australian Government, but on Thursday would not divulge how she made her return to Sydney. The AVO against Mr Abou Lokmeh was dropped.

Facts tendered at Bankstown Court state police were skeptical of Ms Issa’s reported fears and of the alleged threats made by Mr Abou Lokmeh, According to Nine News.

The documents reportedly reveal Ms Issa took out the AVO after arriving at Bankstown Police Station with her lawyer and are in relation to threatening phone calls he allegedly made against her.

She told police she had evidence of phone calls and messages from her estranged husband - but the claims were dismissed by his legal team.

Ms Issa said she didn’t withdraw the complaint against Mr Abou Lokemeh, but that it was dropped because 'the police didn’t investigate properly.'

The brother of Issa earlier made threats to his sister, saying he hopes 'she rots in hell' while she was still in Lebanon.

'She's my sister, I would put a bullet between her eyes, I couldn’t give a s***,' Ahmmad Issa told The Daily Telegraph.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Mr Issa, said his sister had been charged with bigamy not adultery, as she told media, after she married her new boyfriend Mohammad Awick while still married to her estranged husband.
