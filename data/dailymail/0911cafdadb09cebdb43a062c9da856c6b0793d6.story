Sunderland and Leicester are interested in signing out-of-favour Hull City defender Curtis Davies.

The 29-year-old has played 13 times for the Tigers this season, but has lost his place to James Chester for their last two Premier League matches.

Nigel Pearson's Leicester were in for the 29-year-old before his move to Hull last year, but were unable to secure a deal for the City captain.

The Hull City captain was a mainstay in Hull's team last season, but has lost his place in the last fortnight

Davies signed for Steve Bruce's side in June 2013 for £2.25 million, and Hull will not want to sell without making a significant profit on the former England Under 21 international.

It has been suggested that Bruce's supposed willingness to sell Davies is to enable him to free up funds for incoming transfers in the January window.

Hull face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, where Hull are expected to stick with the centre-back partnership of Michael Dawson and Chester.
