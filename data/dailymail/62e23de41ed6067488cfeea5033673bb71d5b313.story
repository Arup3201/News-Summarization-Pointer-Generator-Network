For 49 years it has been an enduring mystery of the Great Train Robbery: Who coshed engine driver Jack Mills?

Now one of the crooks involved in the heist is said to have made a deathbed confession that he did it.

James ‘Big Jim’ Hussey reportedly admitted the crime just moments before dying, anxious that he should not take the secret to his grave.

Audacious crime: A gang of 17 carried out the Great Train Robbery, stopping a mail service on a bridge in Buckinghamshire to steal £2.6million

But last night his so-called 
confession cast a new cloud of intrigue over the robbery, with 
suggestions he was merely trying to lift suspicion from a fellow villain
 still on the run from justice.

The speculation was compounded when 
Mr Mills’s 72-year-old son John confirmed his father told him who did it
 – and it wasn’t Hussey.

Mr Mills rubbished the claim, saying: 
‘My father told me who hit him and he told me the circumstances. I’m not
 prepared to say who it was, but I know.’

Jack Mills suffered head injuries 
when he was attacked by a masked thug wielding an iron bar. He died 
seven years later at 64 from cancer but his family maintains the trauma 
never left him and insisted the blow contributed to his early death.

The fact that he was needlessly 
attacked indelibly tainted public opinion of the gang, some of whom 
acquired underworld ‘celebrity’ because of the scale and audacity of the
 robbery.

Hussey, hired as muscle for the  
17-strong gang that attacked the train in August 1963, served 11 years 
of a 30-year sentence for conspiracy and armed robbery.

He was released in 1975, opening a 
Soho restaurant at one stage with other gang members. The former South 
London decorator continued his life of crime after his release. He was 
sentenced to seven years for his part in a £500,000 cocaine deal.

Ronnie Biggs, who spent three decades 
on the run after escaping from jail in 1970, was not on the mail train 
during the robbery – but conceded some people wrongly assumed he had 
coshed Mr Mills.

In his autobiography, Biggs gives his account of the attack.

Although the wording is ambiguous, it 
suggests the man who coshed Mr Mills was ‘Mr Three’, one of three Biggs 
identifies only by number – the trio that was never brought to justice. 
Hussey died in a South East London hospice on Monday aged 79.

One source said Hussey had kept quiet 
all these years for fear of being prosecuted for the attack, but had 
finally ‘decided to tell the truth’.

Notoriety: Biggs promoting his book Odd Man Out in 1994. He returned to the UK in 2001 and was re-imprisoned, before being released on compassionate grounds in 2009

Some believe, however, that he was 
lying and simply repaying a debt of so-called criminal honour to the 
real perpetrator, possibly a contemporary in the same South London gang.

For years it was assumed it was the 
late Buster Edwards, a boxer and nightclub owner jailed for 30 years for
 his part in the robbery.

But this was a myth perpetuated by Edwards himself to seal a book deal. In reality he never came into contact with Mr Mills.

The robbery took place at Ledburn, 
Buckinghamshire, netting the gang a record £2.6million, worth around 
£40million today.

The raiders were caught after an amateurish plan to 
lie low at a farmhouse went wrong. They were sentenced to a total of 307
 years.
