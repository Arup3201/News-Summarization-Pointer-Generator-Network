Ever wondered what an active volcano actually looks like up close?

Well, now you can see for yourself - without ever having to go dangerously near a lake of erupting lava.

Explorers Sam Crossman and George Kourounis rappelled into the crater of Marum Volcano on Ambrym Island, Vanuatu, getting as close as humanly possible a violently active volcano - and filming it on a GoPro camera for all to see.

What a view! Last month, two men climbed into the crater of an active volcano to film the violently erupting lava

The explorers donned heat protective suits as they repelled the 1200 feet into the crater in Vanuatu

Wearing protective heat suits, the men repelled down the 1200 feet into the crater amid acid rain and near unbearable heat.

'It is one of only five places in the world with persistent lava lakes,' George wrote online afterwards. 

'Getting to it was kind of like a reverse climbing of Everest.'

'The volcano fought back at us, and we had to deal with terrible weather, tremendous heat from the lava, descending and ascending 400 meters of near vertical, loose rock face, acid rain so strong that it could have come from a car battery, and a variety of other craziness.'

The two men used a GoPro camera to get this incredible footage - though the heat melted part of the camera

Say cheese! George posed for a photo in his heat suit in front of the boiling fire

Although the men were splashed by small chunks of lava, which melted a hole in George's rain jacket, they managed to get in and out unscathed.

Their camera on the other hand wasn't so lucky.

'The lava melted part of one of my cameras,' George continued. 'And my protective heat suit is now ruined from the intense acid rain.'
