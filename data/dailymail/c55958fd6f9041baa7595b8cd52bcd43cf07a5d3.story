Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is mad as hell at the IRS and it's not going to take it anymore: the conservative legislator wants the tax agency gone for good

Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is a conservative's conservative, and the IRS's rampant political favoritism has brought him back to one of this signature campaign issues: getting rid of the tax collection agency for good.

'In recent weeks the IRS has admitted to unlawfully targeting conservative groups, and trying to silence the president's critics,' he says in a Web video launched May 27.

Federal legislators, he says 'need to make sure it never happens again. It's time to abolish the IRS.'

The video, which also ran last week as an audio-only ad during Sirius/XM simulcasts of Fox News Channel programs, was produced by the Senate Conservatives Fund, a wealthy political action committee that spent $3.5 million on candidate races in the 2012 election cycle.

That amount put it in the top 13 percent of big-money PACs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

Cruz's senate campaign was the fund's second biggest recipient, taking in more than $315,000. Only Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, who failed in his bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, received more money from the political committee.

But it seems Cruz himself, not the Republican-leaning fund, is driving his embrace of a doomsday scenario for America's widely feared tax collection agency.

'The senator has spoken about this since his campaign,' Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told MailOnline.

'He believes that our tax code should be simple enough that there would be no need for an agency like the IRS,' Frazier said. 'This is an issue of principle.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS

Cruz told Fox News host Eric Bolling on Monday that he's dead serious about his call to put the IRS out of business

The Senate Conservatives Fund launched AbolishIRSnow.com to host Cruz's video. That PAC spent more than $3.5 million on political races in 2012

In a Fox News interview with Cashin' In host Eric Bolling on Sunday, Cruz contended that Barack Obama's presidency gave the IRS's recent history of unethical behavior greater urgency.

'The Obama administration has demonstrated a willingness to use the machinery of government to target their political enemies, and that's wrong,' he said.

'It was wrong when Richard Nixon did it, and it's wrong when Barack Obama did it.'

'It is a manifestation of too much power in the federal government,' Cruz continued. 'When the federal government has that much power in our individual lives, it's an invitation to being abused.

The articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included the allegation that he tried 'to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be initiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner'

Writer Dean Koontz (L) gave $5,000 to the Senate Conservatives Fund, which donated $315,000 to Cruz's 2012 Senate campaign, and launched a video in which he calls for the IRS to be shuttered permanently. Carnival cruise lines CEO Micky Arison (R) donated $1,500.

'I think we ought to abolish the IRS and instead move to a simple flat tax, where the average American can fill out our taxes on a postcard,' Cruz told Bolling,' saying Americans should be able to 'put down how much you earn, put down a deduction for charitable contributions, for [a] home mortgage, and how much you owe.'

Taxpayers, he said, should be motivated to 'take the [IRS] agents, the bureaucracy out of Washington, and limit the power of government.'

He also had strong words for the Obama administration's planned use of the IRS to administer the president's signature health care overhaul law, the Affordable Care Act.

Lois Lerner, head of the IRS unit that decides whether to grant tax-exempt status to groups, was placed on paid suspension after she refused to tell Congress what she knew about the extra scrutiny the IRS gave to tea party and other conservative groups that applied for tax-exempt status

'Right now the IRS is creating the largest database in the country to implement Obamacare,' Cruz claimed, 'and the intrusion into our personal lives, I think is unacceptable.'

'The pattern we’ve seen is its not something we can trust will be administered in a fair way. It’s not something we can trust won’t be used in a partisan way.'

The idea of an IRS-run health care database has been a hotly contested one, with liberal advocates calling the suggestion false on its face.

But the Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote on May 14 that the IRS and the Department of Health and Human Services are 'now building the largest personal information database the government has ever attempted.'

'Known as the Federal Data Services Hub, the project is taking the IRS's own records (for income and employment status) and centralizing them with information from Social Security (identity), Homeland Security (citizenship), Justice (criminal history), HHS (enrollment in entitlement programs and certain medical claims data) and state governments (residency).

'The data hub,' according to the Journal, 'will be used as the verification system for Obamacare's complex subsidy formula.'

Tea party groups staged protests against the IRS in more than a dozen cities on May 21. The agency has acknowledged using political criteria to target some applicants for tax-exempt status

The Senate Conservatives Fund, the PAC that launched Cruz's video campaign, has collected contributions of $200 or more from 7,765 people, according to Federal Election Commission disclosure reports.

Among those donors are author Dean Koontz and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy, who gave $5,000 each; Google vice president Milo Medin, who contributed $2,500; and Carnival cruise lines CEO Micky Arison, who gave $1,500.
