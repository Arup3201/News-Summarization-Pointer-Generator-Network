President Obama and his family will attend this year’s annual ‘Christmas in Washington Concert,’ where Korean rapping sensation PSY is slated to perform, despite controversy surrounding the ‘Gangnam Style’ singer’s anti-American protests several years ago.

PSY, born Park Jae-sang, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame following his 'sexy-horse dance,' rapped at a 2004 protest concert to ‘kill those f****** Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives…kill them all slowly and painfully.’

The rapper apologized last week for using what he said was 'inflammatory and inappropriate language' during anti-U.S. protests at concerts in 2002 and 2004.

Still on: PSY, pictured performing yesterday in Miami, will still perform in tonight's 'Christmas in Washington' concert, slated to air on TNT December 21

In attendance: The Obamas, pictured at last week's annual tree-lighting ceremony, are still going to this year's 'Christmas in Washington' concert

The song, ‘Dear American,’ was written by South Korean metal band N.E.X.T.

Mr Obama traditionally attends the 'Christmas in Washington' concert of carols and songs to benefit Children's National Medical Center. 

The 31st installment is scheduled for Sunday evening at the National Building Museum, and to be hosted for a second year by comedian Conan O'Brien.

Other scheduled performers include Diana Ross, Demi Lovato, ‘American Idol’ alum Scotty McCreery, Chris Mann of 'The Voice' fame, and 'Smash' star Megan Hilty.

In a statement, the rapper said Friday: 'While I'm grateful for the freedom to express one's self, I've learned there are limits to what language is appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be interpreted.

'I will forever be sorry for any pain I have caused by those words,' he added.

In one performance, which PSY said was from eight years ago, the rapper protested the deaths of two teenage South Korean girls who were run over by a U.S. tank stationed in the country.

In a separate performance, PSY was critical of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and its occupation, in which South Korean forces participated.

The concert, which films today, is scheduled to air December 21 on TNT.

Last week, the president was being urged to boycott the 'Christmas in Washington' show and critics were demanding the 34-year-old South Korean pop star be uninvited after his controversial concerts of the past.

But TNT said that despite the furor, PSY will still close the annual event and the Obamas would be in attendance.

The rap sensation's graphic 2004 
anti-American song sparked an angry petition on the White House website 
urging organizers of the event, which will be pre-recorded this Sunday, 
to scratch him from the line up.

'I've learned there are limits to what language is
appropriate and I'm deeply sorry for how these lyrics could be 
interpreted. I will forever be sorry for any pain I have caused by those words.'

-PSY's statement issued last Friday

The petition rapidly made the rounds on 
social media websites as thousands took to Twitter, Facebook and online 
message boards to react to the vitriolic lyrics that PSY once sang about
murdering American soldiers 'slowly and painfully'.

The hashtag 
'GangnamStyleHatesAmerica' was trending as people unloaded on the artist, even after the pop sensation offered a heartfelt apology for the
lyrics, which he sang during a massive protest.

'Reject PSY's apology, you just don't get away with wishing torture & murder on children' wrote @Onision.

@Lizzy3698 wrote: 'Having my father and two brothers in the military I 
was deeply hurt by this. PSY is literally f**king psycho.'

Another user, @StacyOnTheRight wrote, commented: 'Perhaps Psy would like
to address his ridiculous raps to me directly. I'm a Veteran.'

A user commenting on a Daily Mail story wrote: 'As a U.S. Army National 
Guard MP, I wish he would think about the sacrifice of U.S. soldiers in 
the Korean conflict.'

The event will be taped this weekend for broadcast on TNT the Friday before Christmas. The Obamas and other Washington notables are scheduled to attend the show, hosted by Conan O'Brien.

PSY faced considerable anger his actions 
during an anti-American protest in Seoul in 2002, in which he smashed a 
model American tank live on stage. He first held the tank above his 
head, before throwing it to the floor and violently breaking it up with a
microphone stand.

The demonstration happened during strong anti-American sentiment in the country after a 50-ton U.S. armored vehicle killed two 14-year-old South Korean girls, Shim Mi-seon and Shin Hyo-sun, on their way to a birthday party. 

Sergeants
Mark Walker and Fernando Nino were in charge of the vehicle at the time
of the accident and were charged with negligent homicide.

American 
military officials refused requests for the soldiers to be tried in 
South Korean courts.

When
the two men were found not guilty by a U.S. military court in February 
2002, it ignited massive anti-American protests. The memory of the two 
girls is commemorated annually in South Korea.

Then, two years later, a protest concert was held in Seoul after the killing of Kim Sun-il, a South Korean missionary and translator. He was beheaded by militants in Iraq after his country sent 3,000 troops to the region.

At this 2004 anti-war event, a group of musicians, including PSY, performed Dear American, a protest song written by Korean rock band N.E.X.T.

When it came to PSY's turn he rapped about 'killing those f***ing Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives.

'Kill their daughters, mothers, daughters-in-law and fathers. Kill them all slowly and painfully.'

Infectious: PSY has been teaching his unique dance on talk shows, including 'Extra' host Mario Lopez, far right

Claim to fame: PSY is famous for his patented 'sexy horse' dance and snappy wing tip shoes

PSY's unique 'sexy horse' dance has been performed by celebrities and politicians, including everyone from Madonna to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon.

The U.N. leader described the song as 'force for world peace.'

He also performed 'Gangnam Style' at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards in September.

Since then he has appeared on the 'Ellen DeGeneres Show,' twice, the 'Today' show, 'Saturday Night Live' at the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the Formula One Korean Grand Prix, the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards and the 'Tonight show with Jay Leno.'
