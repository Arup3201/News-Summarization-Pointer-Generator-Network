It's certainly a little more original than claiming that the dog ate your homework.

Still, police were less than impressed when they were first told that a van failed to display a proper tax disc because a snail had nibbled away at it.

Luckily, mechanic Jon Roles and his father Steve provided undeniable photographic evidence – and police waived the £100 fine.

A motorist was spared a fine for a missing car tax disc after photographs proved it had been eaten by a snail

Jon Roles was handed the £100 penalty notice after failing to display the certificate in a van he picked up

They even jokingly suggested the men could ‘interrogate the offender, preferably with a teaspoon of salt’.

The insatiable snail slid into the white Peugeot while it was broken down, giving it time to get to work on the tempting tax disc.

When Jon Roles, 33, picked the van up in order to repair it, he found a penalty notice for the ruined disc.

But on closer inspection he realised the hungry mollusc was to blame.

So Mr Roles’s father Steve, who helps out at his son’s garage, set about contesting the fine.

The 70-year-old said: ‘It’s almost unbelievable. I had a bit of a chuckle as I just couldn’t believe what I saw.

‘I think snails like glue and ink so maybe that’s why it ate the disc.

‘It was very much a “dog ate my homework” moment, but we still had the penalty notice to deal with.’

Steve Roles, 70, said: 'It's almost unbelievable. I had a bit of a chuckle as I just couldn't believe what I saw'

The van’s owner had left it in the Roles’s care, so they felt it was their duty to either pay up – or persuade police that no one was at fault. Steve Roles said: ‘We explained the situation but [police] weren’t too keen to see the evidence.

‘They said it was still an offence as the disc was not properly displayed.

‘As it had been partially eaten by the snail, it only said “August” and you couldn’t see the year.

‘But we knew for a fact the customer had taxed the vehicle.’

He wrote to the police to state his case – and this time included photos of the greedy snail.

Mr Roles, of J H Norman and Sons Ltd, in Yeovil, Somerset, said: ‘We felt it was unjust. We tried to make the letter light-hearted but also explain that this all happened by chance.’

Luckily, Avon and Somerset Police agreed, replying: ‘After consideration of all the facts I have decided to excuse payment of the fixed penalty.

‘Please feel free to interrogate the offender, preferably with a teaspoon of salt. Merry Christmas.’ Sadly, the snail died after his taxing meal. Snails often eat paper, which is made up of plant fibres, and are a common pest in postboxes, where they eat both letters and envelope glue, according to Royal Mail.

In last week’s Autumn Statement, Chancellor George Osborne said tax discs will be scrapped next year and replaced with an electronic system.
