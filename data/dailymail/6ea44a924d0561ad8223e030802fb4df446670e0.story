The BBC's new robotic camera system was introduced to cut costs, but exasperated news presenters continue to pay the price - to the amusement of viewers.

Problems arose after their introduction when the broadcaster moved to its new London headquarters in Broadcasting House as part of a £1billion revamp last year - and now it is feared the issue could get worse when a new computer system is launched.

And viewers who caught the antics of the remotely-controlled robot cameras switching away from presenters reporting live or moving in the wrong direction have posted them online.

BBC News presenter Martine Croxall was reporting live last month when the camera failed to focus on her 

Glitches mean the cameras, which are attached to robotic heads and pedestals, and were aimed to eliminate the need for operators, can malfunction leading to exasperation from news presenters

One presenter plagued more often than most is Martine Croxall, who told viewers recently that she must be 'jinxed' after handling at least five incidents, with two in the same week.

Last month, she calmly told viewers during an evening bulletin after the camera failed to focus on where she stood: 'I'm just going to move back to the main set. I know this has happened before. 

'If I sidle in you can pretend you haven't noticed.'

On a programme airing just a week later,  the camera swung away from her again, leading her to declare: 'Do you know I swear I'm jinxed. What am I gonna do?'

Unsure of the camera's intentions, she says 'I'm going to stay where I am', she said as the camera zoomed back. 'I'll stay here.'

Having endured five such incidents, Ms Croxall said: 'If I sidle in you can pretend you haven't noticed'

She added: 'I'm just going to move back to the main set. I know this has happened before'

The camera complications have become common enough that some choose to ignore them while others have attempted to fix problems themselves. 

In May last year, BBC business presenter Aaron Heslehurst told viewers you have 'gotta love these robotic cameras' before reach out in an attempt to switch the camera round. 

After being reprimanded, by producers, he said: 'They're worried I'm going to touch the cameras. I'm not touching your precious robots!'

And Jane Hill was reporting live last year when the camera suddenly swung away and began focusing on random parts of the studio.

A week later, it happened again, leading her to declare: 'Do you know I swear I'm jinxed. What am I gonna do?'

She apologised, adding: 'Clearly not meant to be doing that'  

The robot cameras - which are ordinary broadcast cameras fixed to robotic heads and pedestals - are considered ideal for productions where the same smooth shot is needed to be repeated many times in the same programme and were supposed to eliminate the need to for operators.

But glitches mean they sometimes malfunction.

The Guardian reported that there are concerns the glitches may become even more frequent when BBC News replaces its computer system with a new one in the next two years. 

It is called the Electronic News Production System (ENPS) and this system communicates with a programme called Mosart which controls the cameras.

The current ENPS and its replacement are set to run together for a period.

A source told the newspaper: 'They are due to run together for some time. 

'But bearing in mind the problems that happen with cameras already no one is quite sure what will happen when Mosart has to work with the old and a new system.'

A BBC spokesperson said: 'The BBC is undertaking a procurement for a Newsroom Computer System under the Public Contracts Regulations (2006), having advertised in the Official Journal of the EU, reference 2013/S 174-300782. 

'The BBC is not able to comment further on this procurement until the completion of that process. 

'This is because the BBC must not do anything that might adversely affect that ongoing process, and due to commercial confidentiality.'
