Pay packets for bankers who work at bailed out lenders will be capped under new EU rules.

The crackdown on excessive pay is designed to put an end to multi-million pound deals for executives at banks that have received taxpayers’ cash.

Under the new terms, senior staff at banks receiving any new bailouts would see their pay pegged to the wages enjoyed by ordinary people.

Top bankers who work at bailed out lenders are facing pay caps under new EU rules

Stephen Hester, who was axed last month as boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, was paid a basic salary of £1.2m for last year

The maximum payout would be the higher of 15 times the national average salary or 10 times the wage of the average worker at the bank.

The UK’s national average wage is £26,500, according to the Office for National Statistics, implying a pay ceiling for senior bankers of £397,500.

Stephen Hester, who was axed last month as boss of Royal Bank of Scotland after a series of run-ins with Chancellor George Osborne, was paid a basic salary of £1.2m for last year.

The sum is about 45 times the UK national average salary, although he passed up his bonus for the year.

Chancellor George Osborne is thought to fear that the plan will complicate his efforts to return Royal Bank of Scotland to private hands

Rise: Bonus pay rose dramatically in April this year, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics

The EU will also cap taxpayer-funded bonuses at twice the amount of an executive’s basic wage.

The rules will not be applied to banks which have already received aid, such as RBS and Lloyds, which required a rescue package worth £65billion.

Former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Fred Goodwin was paid a salary of £1.3million the year before the bank had to be bailed out

But they will apply to any bank that goes cap in hand to the government in future.

The measures are intended to stop bankers taking reckless gambles in the knowledge that they will keep the profit, with taxpayers picking up the tab for losses in the event of a major mistake. 

Some £1.4trillion of cash has been pumped into ailing lenders since the banking crisis began in 2008.

Britain, which has a larger banking sector than European counterparts, is understood to have opposed the new pay caps.

Chancellor George Osborne is thought to fear that the plan, which will come into force next month, will complicate his efforts to potentially restructure Royal Bank of Scotland and find a new chief executive for the organisation.

And British banks have lobbied fiercely against the new rules, which they say could limit their ability to attract talented executives.

Germany has already put in place measures to cap pay at three of its bailed out banks at £430,000.

The new pay rules arrived amid a broader revision of how to manage the failure of banks in the event of a financial crisis.

The European Commission will require shareholders and bondholders of banks to be wiped out before granting approval for governments to use taxpayers’ cash to bail them out.
