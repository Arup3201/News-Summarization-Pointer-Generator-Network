The five U.S. cities with the highest violent crime rates are revealed in new FBI statistics released at a time when strained budgets are forcing police layoffs.

No other city in the country, with more than 100,000 people, had a worst rate of serious offences than Flint, Michigan.

The second highest violent crime rate was recorded in Detroit, also in Michigan, followed by St Louis, Missouri; Oakland, California; and Memphis, Tennessee.

Troubled: An excess of guns on the street mean Flint in Michigan had the highest violent crime rate in the U.S. last year, according to FBI figures for the year after 20 police were axed from the city's force

FBI data for 2011 showed there were 2,392 incidents of violent crime in Flint which has a population of around 102,000.

That same year, there were just 1,246 violent crimes in all 10 of the safest cities in America - which in total have 13 times as many residents as Flint.

Flint Mayor Dayne Walling told MSNBC: 'There are too many guns on the street and it’s easy for individuals with evil motives to take another human being’s life.'

The city where unemployment runs at 18.9 per cent and which experienced 52 murders last year lost 20 of its 140 police officers in 2010.

Struggle: Detroit, Michigan where there were 344 murders last year, according to FBI data, faces high unemployment and poverty rates, while the city's police budgets are being cut

The money saving move reduced the presence of police officers in the street and affected how quickly the force could respond to crime.

The far larger city of Detroit in the 
same state recorded the second highest rate of violent crime in the U.S 
last year with 21.4 offences per 1,000 people  - just behind Flint's 
rate of 23.4.

1. Flint, Michigan:

Violent crimes per 1,000: 23.4Population: 102,3572011 murders: 52Unemployment rate: 18.9 percent2. Detroit, Michigan:

Violent crimes per 1,000: 21.4Population: 713,2392011 murders: 344Unemployment rate: 19.9 percent

3. St Louis, Missouri:

Violent crimes per 1,000: 18.6Population: 320,4542011 murders: 113Unemployment rate: 11.7 percent4. Oakland, California:

Violent crimes per 1,000: 16.8Population: 395,3172011 murders: 104Unemployment rate: 15.6 percent5. Memphis, Tennessee:Violent crimes per 1,000: 15.8Population: 652,7252011 murders: 117Unemployment rate: 11.1 percent

The city of more than 710,000 people is one of the country's poorest with almost a third of people living in poverty and a 19.9 per cent unemployment rate.

There were 344 murders committed in the city last year, up 11 on 2010, but an 18 per cent cut Detroit's police budget will see 380 posts lost.

The tightening budget will also see 'Virtual Precincts' introduced with police stations closing from 4pm to 8am and people told to report non-emergency crime to a call centre instead of 911.

The third highest violent crime rate city of St Louis, Missouri experienced 18.6 incidents per 1,000 people in 2011.

There were also 113 murders recorded last year in the city of 320,000 where the unemployment rate runs at more than 11.5 per cent.

The number of murders fell from 144 in the previous year - but the violent crime rate went up by 1.1 per cent over the same period and St Louis robbery rate is the fifth highest in the country.

Despite the high crime rate St Louis Police Department has faced big budgets cuts and may need to have 100 less officers patrolling its streets.

Oakland, California has historically been one of the state's the most crime-ridden cities and its violent crime rate last year of 16.8 per 1,000 people is the fourth highest in the U.S.

The number of murders committed in 2011, 14 more than in 2010, and the city had the ninth-highest murder rate in the country two years in a row.

Oakland city council member Desley Brooks wants to add $11million to the city's police budget, acknowledges increasing violent crime was a problem.

She said to MSNBC: 'We cannot ignore that we have had an increase in violent crime, and so we cannot continue to do the same thing the same way and expect that it’s going to be a different result.'

Ongoing issues: Oakland, California has long been one of the state's the most crime-ridden cities and its violent crime rate last year of 16.8 per 1,000 people is the fourth highest in the U.S

The FBI crime report revealed that overall the U.S. experienced a four per cent drop in reported violent crime, year on year.

The findings were is based on information collected from 14,009 law enforcement agencies across the country.

Another city that defied that the national trend of declining crime rates in major U.S. cities last year was Memphis, Tennessee.

Its violent crimes rate per 1,000 people increased, from 15.4 to 15.8 with murders going from 89 in 2010 to 117 in 2011 and 100 more aggravated assault cases.

The unemployment rate went 1.2 percent over the 12 months and the with the city facing a £45million budget deficit its mayor A C Wharton Jr has refused to rule out police officer redundancies.
