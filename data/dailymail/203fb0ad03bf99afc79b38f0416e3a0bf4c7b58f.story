An eight-year-old girl is missing after she was snatched while playing on the swings outside her home.

Monserrat Aguirre was playing with other children in the playground outside Willow Bend apartments in Tulsa, Oklahoma, when a man pulled up, grabbed her, then drove away.

Witnesses said the kidnapper put his hand around Monserrat's mouth and dragged the terrified child back to his car.

Amber alert: Monserrat Aguirre was snatched from a playground outside her home in Tulsa last night by a white man who drove up in a small white car, walked over, put his hand over her mouth, and dragged her off

Police hunting for Monserrat have issued an amber alert, saying her family told them they don't have any reason to believe a friend of relative was involved in the abduction.

'At this time we're calling it a complete stranger abduction,' said Tulsa police spokesman Jillian Roberson.

She said most of the witnesses to the abduction were other children, but one adult was nearby and saw part of what happened.

Monserrat was on the swing set outside the Willow Bend complex at around 7.20pm last night when her kidnapper, a white male, pulled up in a small white car.

Officials said he approached her and three other children and spoke before dragging her off.

Police were at the scene investigating the sudden abduction until late last night, reported Tulsa World's Samantha Vicent.

Monserrat is Hispanic, four-foot tall, 85lbs, with black hair and brown eyes. She was wearing a white skirt with ruffles and a pink shirt when she was taken.

The suspect is a white male, possibly with a beard, who was wearing a brown hat. The car he was driving could be a Ford Focus or a Ford Escape.

Officer Roberson said her colleagues and members of Tulsa PD's Fugitive Warrants Unit, which includes U.S. Marshals, are looking for any cars matching the witnesses' descriptions.

'We have received many calls, and we're appreciative of the public's help,' she said.
