A pilot is being praised for making a successful belly landing after a bird strike led to a landing gear malfunction on approach to Kenya’s capital.

The Fokker 50 aircraft, carrying six people, was travelling from Wajir to Nairobi when it struck two marabou storks during take-off.

One of the birds became wedged in a landing gear door, forcing the flight crew to make an emergency belly landing at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.

Officials said the left main landing gear failed to extend because it was blocked by the carcass of a bird

No injuries were reported but flights into the international airport – one of the busiest in East Africa – were suspended for hours until the stricken plane was removed with a crane.

Flights were diverted to the port city of Mombasa until the runway reopened.

Skyward, the plane’s owner, said the flight crew ‘felt a thud’ when the aircraft collided with the birds but did not realise one was wedged in the left main landing gear door.

The airline told The Standard: ‘On approaching Nairobi Wilson Airport and extending the landing gear, the nose wheel and the right main landing gear extended, but the left main landing gear did not extend as its door was wedged shut by the remains of the bird.

Skyward, the airline that owns the plane, said the aircraft struck two marabou storks during take-off

‘After extensive trouble shooting and use of the emergency gear extension to lower the gear, the crew realised that nothing could lower the left main landing gear.’

The decision was made to burn off as much fuel as possible and divert to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport for a belly landing.

Skyward director Emil Arao told The Standard: ‘Our very experienced crew performed a very difficult manoeuvre and undertook a successful belly landing on JKIA's runway 06 at 1102 hours local time with no injuries to anyone both in the aircraft and on the ground.’
