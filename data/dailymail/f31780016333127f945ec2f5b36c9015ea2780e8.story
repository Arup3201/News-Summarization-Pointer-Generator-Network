A burglar who raided a guest house hours after being let out of prison was caught after leaving his release form at the crime scene.

Robert Taylor, 36, had just been released from jail for a previous burglary offence when he and William Shearon, 23, broke into the Bridlington guest house.

The pair stole a television, mobile phone, charity boxes for the RNLI and alcohol and cash from Kilburn Guest House in Easy Yorkshire.

They also took the owner's Ford Mondeo.

Taylor was caught after a neighbour found his release form left on boxes of the stolen items in his back garden.

Hull Crown Court heard the man was woken by his dogs barking at 5am and when he went to investigate the letter addressed to Taylor.

It included details of his release from prison just hours earlier, alongside his name and address on.

The police were called and launched a search of the area to find Taylor, who was found alongside Shearon as they ran into friend's Daniel Kilbride's house.

Taylor, from Bridlington, pleaded guilty at Hull Crown Court to burglary, taking a vehicle without consent and theft.

He has also been jailed for two years and banned from driving for 12 months.

The Honorary Recorder of Hull and the East Riding, Judge Michael Mettyear, told him: 'You have more than 40 offences of theft and everything has been tried with you over the years.

'It may well be that drink and drugs has played a part but that is no consolation to your victims or an excuse.'

Shearon, also from Bridlington, pleaded guilty to burglary and handling stolen goods and has been jailed for two years.

Kilbridge, of Bridlington, has been jailed for nine months after he admitted handling stolen goods.
