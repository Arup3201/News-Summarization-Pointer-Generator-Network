Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed to his girlfriend of three years when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities.

The 31-year-old Australian, who is currently awaiting execution on the island of Nusakambangan, asked his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila if she would be his wife when she visited him in Kerobokan prison in February. 

Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death by Indonesian president Joko Widodo.

Febyanti and Chan met each other in Kerobokan prison in 2012 after a friend introduced the pair.

The Indonesian had been visiting the prison as part of her role as a pastor and Chan was carrying out theological studies in the hope of becoming a minister.

Since then they have dreamed of his release, even talking about plans to have children together one day.  

Convicted drug smuggler Andrew Chan proposed to his girlfriend Febyanti Herewila (pictured with ring) of three years when he discovered his clemency bid had been rejected by Indonesian authorities.

Febyanti Herewila Febyanti immediately accepted his proposal, despite the fact that she knew he was condemned to death.

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph Febyanti claimed she is totally in love with Chan and she did not accept his proposal out of pity for the Bali Nine prisoner.

'I love him for who he is. And I see what he does for other people and that makes me love him more,' Febyanti said.

'If you ask me why do I love him, it's because he also has weaknesses as well but he also has a lot of good things about him. I accept him the way he is. I am also very proud of him.'

Chan was convicted in 2005 after attempting to smuggle 8.2kg of heroin from Bali to Australia. He has called Kerobokan prison in Bali his home for the past ten years and got a new lease of life in 2012 when he met the love of his life.

Last Valentine's Day, Chan sent Febyanti red roses and a teddy bear and when she visited the jail they would chat about their dreams of one day opening a centre for unprivileged kids. 

On the day Chan proposed, the happy couple sat around the prison eating cake and celebrating by praying for his release.

Febyanti and Chan's brother attempted to visit him one last time in Kerobokan prison last Wednesday before his transfer to the Indonesian 'death island' but were denied access.

On Monday, Febyanti was one of a selected number of family members who visited Chan on Nusakambangan island. 

Along with fellow Bali nine prisoner Myuran Sukumaran they hold out desperate hope that a last ditch legal appeal will bring them mercy.

The family members were driven in a motorcade from the airport in Cilacap before climbing aboard a small boat, assisted by embassy officials, to visit the Nusakambangan prison island.

Michael Chan, the brother of death-row prisoner Andrew Chan, and Chintu Sukumaran, the brother of Myuran Sukumaran spoke to journalists at Wijayapura port. 

Hopeful that it won’t be the last time they see their loved-ones, Chan's mother Helen and Sukumaran's parents Sam and Raji and his sister Brintha also made the emotional journey.

The Age reports Chinthu told reporters: 'My mum, sister and I have been waiting and counting down the days. We have been told he is doing well but we just want to see for ourselves, just make sure to go and see him, to let him know that we love him.'

Michael said: 'Mum is fairly excited to see Andy today and it's been a few days, you know. We are looking forward to seeing him when we get over there.'

Lawyers for the death row inmates say there are positive signs in a grim situation.

The legal team will be back in court on Thursday where they will present a high level argument that Indonesia's president is subject to Indonesian law. 

Their fresh appeal for clemency for the pair will be heard in an administrative court in Jakarta.

‘The main promising thing for us is that they're not dead,’ lawyer Peter Morrissey told ABC radio on Monday.

‘The way some officials were talking, they should have been dead weeks ago.’

Jakarta has indicated it plans to wait for the result of legal appeals of some of the 10 drug felons waiting for the firing squad.

The heartbreaking video shows Andrew Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail

On Sunday, footage emerged of doomed Bali Nine ringleader Chan speaking about second chances just hours after the first round of executions on January 18.

The heartbreaking video shows Chan speaking from what is believed to be inside Kerobokan jail.

Behind him prison bars are visible as he looks tearily into the camera and talks in soft spoken tones.

The 30-second video was aired on Channel Seven's Sunday Night.

'My name's Andrew Chan,' the convicted drug smuggler said.

Andrew Chan took a bible with him to the 'death island' on Wednesday 

'It's a day - pretty much a few hours - after the execution of six innocent lives.

'Guess what runs through my head is about how precious life really is.'

On January 18, five people were executed by firing squad on Nusakambangan - Indonesia's 'Death Island - in Central Java.

Dutchman Ang Kiem Soe, Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, Nigerian Daniel Enemuo, Malawi's Namaona Denis and Indonesia's Rani Adriani were killed that day.

Kerobokan prison had been the Bali Nine duo's home for 10 years after they were found guilty of drug smuggling

Another woman Tran Bich Hanh, from Vietnam, was also put to death nearby. 

Their deaths triggered Chan to ask: 'I guess sometimes you kinda got to think, what does it take to get a second chance?

'People get second chances within their lives on the outside, but how much can you get when you’re a convicted criminal.'

Sukuraman also admitted on Sunday Night he had thought about hanging himself or getting someone else to shoot him.

'I don't really think I'll enjoy the process of being dragged in front of a firing squad,' he said.
