You can be the most famous rapper on earth, but when the old lady on the subway doesn't know your face, you know there's still work to do.

It's a feeling Jay-Z knows well after he was filmed taking the New York underground to his latest gig.

Surrounded by his entourage of man-mountain bodyguards, producers and a film crew, the 43-year-old starts a near riot when he enters the Canal Street Station, ticket in hand.

'Are you famous?' When Jay Z boards the Q line for the Barclays Center and sits down on the only available seat, a grey-haired woman on the adjoining seat wonders why the commotion

Platinum record star: The woman appears oblivious to Jay Z's worldwide fame

He is first seen passing a sign to the J/Z subway line to Brooklyn, the line that he rode home as a child and later named himself after

But when he boards the line for the Barclay Center and sits down on the only available seat, a grey-haired woman on the adjoining seat asks: 'Are you famous?'

Jay-Z, who is worth nearly $500 million, has sold approximately 50 million albums and received 14 Grammy Awards for his work, responds: 'Not very famous, you don't know me. But I'll get there some day.'

He adds: 'My name is Jay, what's your name?'

'Ellen,' she smiles. 'What do you do?'

Megastar: Jay-Z is worth nearly $500 million, has sold approximately 50 million albums and received 14 Grammy Awards for his work, but he remained humble

Surprised: The woman is in fact Ellen Grossman, a successful Brooklyn-based artist herself

Normal (ish) conversation: It was a touching vignette that reveals how the barrier of fame can be broken down with a few small words

'I make music,' he replies before explaining that he has just completed eight shows and was en route to the Barclays Center to perform the last.

'Fabulous,' Ellen replies. 'And you are getting on the subway. I'm proud of you.'

She then askes him to repeat his name.

'Jay. Jay-Z,' he replies.

The video takes viewers behind the scenes of his string of gigs at the venue, with footage of rehearsals and the live shows, climaxing at the center on September 28.

Jay-Z said that performing in his 
hometown was better than performing at the Grammys, Glastonbury or 
Coachella. He yelled to the crowd of 18,000: 'Nothing feels like 
tonight!'

Big star: Moments later, Jay Z was performing his hits to a crowd of over 18,000 fans

Sell out crowd: It was part of a run of nine gigs - all of which were sold out

The arena was full of exciting 
concertgoers, as the chaotic crowd made way to their seats after waiting
 outside to enter the building. Jay-Z emerged onstage as a video about 
Brooklyn's history played in the background.

He
 opened with his songs about Brooklyn - 'Where I'm From' and 'Brooklyn 
Go Hard.' He also performed two songs from fellow Brooklynite Notorious 
B.I.G. He then held a moment of silence for the late rap veteran.

He told the crowd when B.I.G.'s 'Juicy' played: 'Sing loud so he can hear you in heaven.'

The rapper is the co-owner of the Brooklyn Nets, who play at the new arena.
