An artist has been arrested in Japan for scanning a 3D version of a selfie she took of her vagina and distributing it to supporters, to allow them to build kayaks in the form of her anatomy.

Megumi Igarashi made her own kayak using a 3D scanner, which you can see in the photo below.

However her feminist agenda has been 
curtailed by her arrest, which occurred when she emailed the 3D scan of 
her private parts to 30 people.

Megumi took a picture of her vagina which was then scanned into a 3D printer to allow it to be printed out and then built

She also makes a wide 
variety of sculptures and art featuring painted or imprinted vaginas, 
which she calls Manko, crude Japanese slang for the vagina.

On her blog Megumi, 42, made a plea for money to enable her to move on from art made from hand moulds of her vagina. 

She wrote on her blog: ‘Mould by hand is not suitable for making large art pieces such as a door, a car, or a boat. I was wondering how I can make it possible, and then I finally found that 3D scanner can make it happen easily!'

‘A 3D scanner can be used to make a boat that will go across the ocean!

'But the problem is the technology and the cost. I cannot afford it nor use the scanner alone.

‘So here is my request for your support to make the world’s first 3D scanned vagina boat that goes beyond the seas.’

While, by evidence of these photographs, it seems Megumi did receive adequate funding for her bizzare and ambitious project, it led to her falling foul of the Japanese obscenity laws.

Other items she has fashioned using her vagina as part of her Decoman project include jewellery (bottom right), as well as numerous small 'scenes¿ in which tiny model men are posed on grass covered moulds of her vagina

Website Kotaku reports that she is currently being held by police in Tokyo.

Other items she has fashioned using her vagina include a lampshade, a remote-controlled car, and a smartphone case, as well as numerous small ‘scenes’ in which tiny model men are posed on grass covered moulds of her vagina.

On her blog, where she writes about her work and exhibitions under the pseudonym Rokudenashiko which roughly translates to ‘bad girl’ or 'good-for-nothing girl', Megumi says: ‘I thought it was just funny to decorate my vagina and make into a diorama, but I was very surprised to see how upset people get when they see my works or even hear me say the word Manko.

'Manko and vagina, have been such a taboo in Japanese society. Penis, on the other hand, has been used in illustrations and has become a part of pop culture.

'But vagina has never been so cute. Vagina has been thought to be obscene because its been overly hidden; although it is just a part of a woman’s body.'
