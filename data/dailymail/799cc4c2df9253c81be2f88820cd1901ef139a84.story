While Floyd Mayweather was sat courtside watching Los Angeles Clippers play Brooklyn Nets and listening to the deafening chants of 'we want Pacquiao, we want Pacquiao', the Filipino fighter that the world of boxing is so desperate to see him take on was far away, dining in a palace.

It sounds akin to the lavish lifestyle that Mayweather needs no encouragement to flaunt on his Instagram page, but Manny Pacquiao was demonstrating the opposite characteristics as he and his wife Jinkee took Prince Harry up on his invitation to dine with him at Buckingham Palace.

Pacquiao has a formidable reputation in the boxing ring; his record of 38 knock-outs in 55 victories could be enough to deter the usually brash Mayweather from engaging in a bout that could raise at least £200million for the pair.

But the iconic Filipino boxer was truly humbled to be in the presence of royalty and was reportedly invited by Harry to have dinner with him before being given a tour of the palace.

'Dinner with Prince Harry is so nice thank you Lord,' Pacquiao said on his own Instagram page.

The boxer handed the prince a signed pair of gloves, and wrote alongside another picture that 'it was a great experience.'
