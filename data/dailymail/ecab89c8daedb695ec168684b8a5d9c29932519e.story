Police are investigating allegations that Premier League star William Gallas was involved in a public spat with his wife, who ended up in a hedge.

A witness has told the Metropolitan Police that the couple were having a bust-up outside their Hampstead home.

Nadege Gallas, 31, then fell in a bush and was treated by paramedics before being taken to hospital.

The French international Spurs defender, who earns a reported £3.2million a year, followed behind in his Jeep.

Witnesses told The Sun that she had arrived at the mansion in her car and then shouted at her husband.

Gallas then emerged and yelled back several people watched on.

Peter Lenczuk, 38, said: 'They were arguing but I couldn't understand because it was in French. Then I saw her fall into the bushes.'

London Ambulance confirmed they had attended an incident in Gallas's street.

'We sent an ambulance and a responder in a car to the scene,' a spokesman said.

'Our staff treated the person at the scene before taking them to hospital.'

The couple later returned home from hospital together before the footballer drove off again.

Builders working on the house next door say they watched the row and 
shouted to Gallas to make him stop, but he carried on. 'It was 
horrible,' one said.

'Officers spoke to the alleged victim and no allegations were made to police,' a Met spokesman told MailOnline, adding they 'will be speaking the third party in due course to substantiate the allegation'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
