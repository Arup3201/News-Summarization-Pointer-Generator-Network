The break off of Sandy Beach in Oahu is notoriously dangerous and tricky to surf.

But an effortlessly cool seal put its fellow surfers to shame, hanging ten with ease on the Hawaiian beach.

The marine mammal was caught on camera catching waves and swimming amongst the crowd while it waited for the next swell during a busy day at the beach in August. 

Captured by New York photographer, David Amann, 52, the agile creature is seen diving beneath the water, allowing the tide to carry it towards the shoreline.

The Hawaiian monk seals only visit the beach a few times a year, and David managed to grab the camera from his bag and snap the seal as it enjoyed the surf.

David said: 'This is a very unusual occurrence, seals do visit Sandy Beach a couple of times a year but I have never seen one come in on the breaking side of the beach.

'It certainly does look like it is catching a ride onto the beach, I have never seen this done by a monk seal before but they are experts in the water and I am sure it knows what it is doing.

'The seal did make it to the beach for a relaxing rest on this sunny day.

'As soon as the people realised the seal was approaching the beach, everyone ran in that direction.

'I had my camera handy in my bag, but it was my wife, Elizabeth, that first spotted the seal.

'It is always a treat to get a visit from our ocean living brothers and sister so we were very excited, especially to see the seal catching some waves.'

The Hawaiian monk seal is an endangered species of seal native to the Hawaiian islands. There are just over 1,000 remaining.

Sandy Beach, on the South Shore, is well known for its strong rip tides and shore break very close to the shoreline. 

The latter is the cause of many swimmer injuries, and has earned it the nickname 'break-neck beach'.

A favourite of Barack Obama, who grew up in Oahu, locals this month successfully opposed a movement to have the beach renamed President Barack Obama Sandy Beach Park.
