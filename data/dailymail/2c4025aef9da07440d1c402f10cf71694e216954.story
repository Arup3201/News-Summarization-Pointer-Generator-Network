A 64-year-old Marine Corps. veteran has died in a car crash - just five days after his 29-year-old son was killed in a fire at the house they shared.

John Hover, who fought in Vietnam, was driving on Route 43 in North Greenbush, New York on Thursday afternoon when his 2002 Ford truck veered into oncoming traffic for an unknown reason, police said.

He smashed into a 2006 Toyota driven by 66-year-old Jean Eldred, from West Sand Lake, and both became trapped in the wreckage and had to be cut out by firefighters.

They were rushed to Albany Medical Center Hospital and Hover was initially listed in critical condition. Police announced his death on Friday morning.

Eldred was listed in serious condition.

North Greenbush Police Chief Robert Durivage noted that Mr Hover got into the crash just days after his son was killed - but added that the road had a history of crashes, the Times Union of Albany reported.

'This is the second serious accident 
we've had in this portion of the S-turns of Route 43 in the last 45 days
and in both cases, a motorist crossed into the on-coming lane causing 
the collision,' he said.

No charges have been filed in the crash and an investigation is ongoing.

Hover was a Marine Corps Veteran who served in the Vietnam War and in the Army Reserve. He worked as the foreman for a lumber yard and enjoyed collecting knives, his obituary noted.

Hover's death comes just days after he was treated at the same hospital for injuries he and his wife, Georgia, sustained in a fire at their home in Poestenkill.

Four fire departments - including one just 100 yards away - responded to the blaze at 10.10pm on Sunday and arrived to find the flames ripping through the front of the family's home on Plank Road.

As well as the couple, their son Devin Hover was inside but did not make it out alive.

Neighbors recalled how Mrs Hover, who uses a wheelchair, managed to get to the front of the house before trying to head back to save her son. They held her back as firefighters arrived.

They told CBS6 how they could hear Mr Hover shouting desperately for his son.

But Devin Hover was found dead after firefighters stopped the blaze, which gutted the family's wood-framed house. Officials have determined that the fire was accidental.
