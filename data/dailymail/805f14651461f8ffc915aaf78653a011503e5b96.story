Manchester City have finally welcomed top-scorer Sergio Aguero back to training as they look to increase the pressure on Chelsea. 

The Barclays Premier League champions have already had a good few weeks, clawing back Chelsea’s lead at the top of the table, signing Frank Lampard until the end of the season and opening talks with Swansea City over the proposed transfer of Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony.

Now, as revealed in Thursday’s Sportsmail, Aguero has taken his next step towards fitness by returning to full training ahead of this weekend’s trip to Everton.

Aguero may well be held back for the Arsenal game a week on Sunday but is pushing hard for a place on the bench on Saturday.

Fellow striker Edin Dzeko - recovered from a calf strain - has a better chance of starting, as does captain Vincent Kompany who had a hamstring injury. 

Meanwhile, the Premier League has confirmed that Lampard is registered solely with City after he reneged on an agreement to join New York City FC in America’s MLS this month. 

The league is also satisfied that the Premier League champions have not broken any rules over the signing. 

A Premier League statement read: ‘The Premier League has sought and received assurances from Manchester City that there is no agreement in place between the club or City Football Group with New York City FC relating to the player.'
