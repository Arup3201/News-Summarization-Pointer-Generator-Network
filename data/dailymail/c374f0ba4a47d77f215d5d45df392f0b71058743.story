Comedian Tracy Morgan may never perform again, as a result of the injuries he sustained in a deadly accident earlier this year, his lawyer has said.

The 45-year-old suffered serious injuries in a collision with an allegedly exhausted Walmart truck driver, who slammed into his limo bus on the New Jersey turnpike in June.

Fellow comedian James McNair was killed in the crash as he and others were accompanying the former Saturday Night Live-star back from a show in Delaware.

Career destroyed: Comedian Tracy Morgan may never perform again as a result of the crash in New Jersey in June this year which killed another comedian, James MacNair

Morgan 
spent several weeks in rehab with rib and leg injuries, but is still 
undergoing treatment for injuries to his brain, including daily speech, 
cognitive, vocational and physical therapies.

The 30 Rock star's lawyer, Benedict Morelli, said 'The jury’s still out' on whether Morgan will ever be able to perform again.

'The doctors don’t know the answer. I don’t know the answer,' he added, according to the New York Post's Page Six.

Morgan
 and several other passengers are suing Walmart, who responded to the 
suit on Monday by claiming the comedian and his friends are to blame for
 their injuries.

In a statement issued Tuesday, Morgan responded: 'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused.'

Tragedy:  Morgan's friend and fellow comedian James MacNair died in the accident

Morgan
 says he felt like he had to respond publicly to Walmart's latest 
effort, and went on to say that he and his friends did noting wrong in 
the accident.

Bentonville,
 Arkansas-based Walmart Stores Inc. said in their Monday court filing 
that the passengers' injuries were caused by their 'failure to properly 
wear an appropriate available seatbelt restraint device,' which it says 
constitutes unreasonable conduct.

If
 they had been wearing a restraint, Walmart argues that 'all or a 
portion of the injuries could have been diminished or minimized.'

An attorney representing Morgan and the other plaintiffs hasn't commented.

Walmart didn't respond to claims that their driver, Kevin Roper, hadn't slept in more than 24 hours before the crash.

The
 company did admit though that Morgan and his friends' injuries 'may 
have been caused by third parties over whom Walmart had no control.' 

After
 the deadly crash, Roper was charged with causing the accident. 
Investigators believe he was dozing off behind the wheel in the moments 
before the collision and didn't see the traffic ahead of him until it 
was too late.

'[The]
 driver failed to observe slow-moving traffic ahead,' New Jersey State 
Police Sgt. First Class Gregory Williams said. 'He observed at the last 
minute -- just prior to impact -- the limo bus carrying Morgan and his 
party.'
