Claire Falls wrote a letter to the Prime Minister when she heard funding to the Paralympic football team had been cut

A young girl who penned a letter to the Prime Minister of Australia when she discovered funding to her favourite sport had been slashed, has hit back at Tony Abbott's response saying he didn't answer her questions.

Claire Falls, who is just 12 years old, was outraged when she heard that Australia's Paralympic football team had their $175,000 Commonwealth funding reduced to nothing.

A footballer herself, Claire is vision impaired and expressed her disappointment with the Australian Sports Commission in a letter to Mr Abbott, the Sydney Morning Herald report.

The Australian Sports Commission is responsible for distributing the funds which are allocated to Paralympic sports, and this year the Pararoos missed out completely.

Currently ranked 12th in the world, the Pararoos haven't made an appearance at the Paralympics since 2000, and the team's low rank was apparently one of the big reasons funding was pulled.

The team was formed by the Cerebral Palsy Australian Sport & Recreation Federation and the Australian Paralympic Committee back in 1998.

In her letter, Claire told the Prime Minister she was upset because she looked up to the team as role models and her sport wasn't all about winning medals.

'What hope is there for us kids? What do we have to aim for? How is that promoting encouragement, respect or inclusion?' she wrote.

The vision impaired footballer was not happy with Mr Abbott's response and said he didn't answer her questions

She received a letter back from Mr Abbott, but was not impressed with the stock-standard response he sent her.

His letter opened with 'One of the most enjoyable things about being Prime Minister is hearing from young people like yourself.'

'It says something positive about you that you were willing to take the time to write and share with me your thoughts about the issues that face our country,' it continued.

But for Claire, who also wrote to the Sports Minister Peter Dutton and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, described Mr Abbott's response as rude.

The Pararoos are currently ranked 12th in the world but haven't competed at the Paralympics since 2000

'Isn’t democracy supposed to be about equality and social justice and being able to have a say about things that important to you? The PM couldn’t even be bothered to answer any of my questions,' she told the publication.

Claire's mother Shari Maguire said she doesn't think the MPs know who they're up against and her daughter will not be easily deterred from pursuing something she is passionate about.

'There is no grey in Claire’s world and certainly not when it comes to issues of equality.'

When the funding announcement was made, Pararoos coach Paul Brown launched an online campaign to restore funding and is apparently in talks with the Australian Paralympic Committee to devise a solution.

Claire said she was not impressed with the Prime Minister's response and has also written to the Sports Minister and Opposition Leader
