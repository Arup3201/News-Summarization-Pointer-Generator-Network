A drawing by a pre-Raphaelite master worth £50,000 has been discovered hanging in the landing of a country house.

The picture, by founder 19th century movement Dante Gabriel Rossetti, has hung unknown on a wall until it was discovered by chance.

The owners, who have asked not to be named, had no idea what the work of an unremarkable female model was or who it was by until they invited an auctioneer round to value some silver.

Master: The previously unknown drawing by pre-Raphaelite master Dante Gabriel Rossetti is expected to fetch £50,000 at auction.

Eagle-eyed expert Guy Schwinge spotted the 16ins by 13ins framed drawing at the top of the stairs of the property and suspected it may have been a Rossetti.

He then consulted leading Rossetti expert Christopher Newell and he has confirmed it to be an original work of the celebrated English artist.

It is not a previously-recorded work by the Rossetti. The drawing, in coloured chalks, will now be sold at auction with a pre-sale estimate of 50,000 pounds.

The woman in the drawing is Alexa Wilding, who was one of Rossetti's favourite models.

She was paid a retaining fee by him on the agreement that she sat exclusively for him.

Mr Schwinge, of Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, Dorset, said: "I was called out to value some silver at a country house in the Home Counties.

"I chanced upon it as I climbed the stairs. It was at the top, hanging on a wall on the landing.

"It was a powerful drawing which immediately shouted out Rossetti.

"The client allowed me to take it away for further research and I contacted Christopher Newell who confirmed it from the style and execution and from who the sitter was.

"It is neither dated nor previously recorded and it appears to be a preparatory sketch for a bigger work.

For sale: The picture, held by Amy Brenan from Duke's Auctioneers, above is expected to fetch £50,000 when it is sold on September 26

"When I told my clients they were naturally very pleased. There is lots of excitement in it from collectors interested in the pre-Raphaelite movement."The chalk drawing shows Alexa Wilding with her face turned to the left. Her eyes are a clear blue and her lips and skin seen as a rosy complexion.

Rossetti had bumped into an 18-year-old Alexa as she walked down the Strand in London in 1865.

He persuaded her to model for him and within a year he had embarked on the series of paintings of her which are exhibited in museums today.

Art historian Mr Newell said: "It is immediately recognisable as a Rossetti. It is the type of drawing that he made and of a model who was familiar to him.

"It is typical of his work. Parts of it are highly worked textures while other parts are just blocked in or left blank."

The owners, who are descendants of a patron of Ressetti, were said to be 'very pleased' with the discovery.

It will be sold by Duke's on September 26.
