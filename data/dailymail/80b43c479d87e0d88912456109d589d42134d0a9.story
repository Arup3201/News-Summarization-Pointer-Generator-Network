The creators of Mad Men have been accused of being insensitive to 9/11 victims’ families over the poster being used in New York to advertise the new series.

The billboards, which have been put up close to Ground Zero, depict a male character falling from the sky against a white background.

New Yorkers have said it reminds them of the iconic image of the ‘Falling Man’ who hurled himself out of the World Trade Centre to escape the burning building.

Eye-catching: The billboards, which have been put up close to Ground Zero, depict a male character falling from the sky against a white background

Going down: The poster has been put up around Manhattan and is supposed to show the main character, 1960s advertising executive Don Draper, tumbling through the sky

He and dozens of others chose to commit suicide rather than burn to death during the 2001 attack which killed 2,977 people including 68 Britons.

Deborah Burlingame, whose father Charles was the pilot of the jet which crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11, said the advert was ‘cruel and truly tasteless’.

She said: ‘I find it impossible to believe that any advertiser could be so stupid as to think you can put up a billboard in New York City which shows a human being tumbling down in space and not imagine that this will evoke the tragic memory of those poor souls on 9/11. 

‘I think this advertiser has decided that creating a controversy, at the expense of the thousands of people who will be hurt by this image of man falling to his certain death, is worth it.’

Memorable image: The fifth season of Mad Men is currently being filmed although it has already won four Emmy awards and inspired a wave of 1960s fashion

Prominent: AMC, the network on which Mad Men appears in the U.S., defended itself in a statement

The poster has been put up around 
Manhattan and is supposed to show the main character, 1960s advertising 
executive Don Draper - played by Jon Hamm - tumbling through the sky.

One of the most prominent billboards is opposite Penn Station in Midtown, which is used by millions of tourists every year.

John Feal, who heads the Fealgood Foundation supporting 9/11 emergency workers, said: ‘I think it lacks sensitivity.

‘It doesn’t matter how far away we go from 9/11, for some it will always be an open wound’

Nancy
Nee, who lost her firefighter brother George Cain during the attack, 
said: ‘It seems that Hollywood - and now advertising - doesn’t care 
about the sensitivities of the families and New Yorkers.

‘As a family member, these images are disturbing when you’re not prepared or in the mood to see them.’

The fifth season of Mad Men is currently being filmed although it has already won four Emmy awards and inspired a wave of 1960s fashion.

AMC, the network on which Mad Men appears in the U.S., defended itself in a statement.

It said: ‘The image of Don Draper tumbling through space has been used since the show began in 2007 to represent a man whose life is in turmoil.

‘The image used in the campaign is intended to serve as a metaphor for what is happening in Don Draper’s fictional life and in no way references actual events,' the statement added.
