Animal rights activists targeted models at one of the opening shows of New York Fashion Week which saw them paraded around Central Park on controversial horse-drawn carriages.

Victor dE Souza, who has dressed Rihanna, Madonna and Lady Gaga, put seven models in the carriages wearing his designs on Wednesday night, in what was described as a moveable fashion show through the park.

But the show was picketed by animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who are seeking to ban the carriages saying they are inhumane to horses.

Some even followed the carriages through the park, heckling the models as they made their way around the route.

The show saw dE Souza's models wearing extravagant gowns while being taken around the southern area of Central Park in the carriages which were steered by drivers wearing traditional coats, tails and top hats.

Speaking before the show, Mr de Souza said: 'Horse-drawn carriages have been a part of the beautiful cityscape that is New York for more than 150 years.

The park's horse-drawn carriages have proved controversial in recent months after city mayor Bill De Blasio said the use of the animals is inhumane.

A battle between animal rights activists and drivers of the carriages has been raging, with those who work in the city stables warning that the horses could become horse meat in countries such as Mexico.

They argue that the carriage business provides a home for unwanted horses from the farming and racing industries. With this sanctuary eliminated, these animals will be shipped off to be killed for meat, they say.

Meanwhile animal rights group dismiss this claim, saying keeping horses in built up urban areas and forcing them to toil for hours on end in traffic is cruel.

More than 100 designers are scheduled to show their spring-summer 2015 collections during New York Fashion Week in the Mercedes-Benz tents at Lincoln Center and at other New York venues.

The eight-day event kicks off the season, with the industry moving on to London, followed by Milan and Paris, when the New York shows conclude.
