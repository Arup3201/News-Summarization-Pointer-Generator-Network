Katie Couric has been left shaken after learning that a phone line still listed in her late husband's name has been making early-morning 911 calls.

Each time the calls have been placed at 2 a.m. on Tuesday mornings, police have been sent to her Manhattan home to investigate. In total, there have been at least 10 calls from the line, police said.

The television host was so distressed that she even contacted New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly to ask for his help.

The New York Police department is now looking into the calls, which could be the work of a prankster or simply from a fault with the line, a source told the New York Daily News.

Concerns: Katie Couric, pictured last week, has been left shaken by 911 calls made from a phone line registered in her late husband's name. The calls have sent police patrol cars to her home

A tired-looking Couric made the revelation about the bizarre calls to her audience members ahead of a taping of her show on Tuesday.

She arrived on the set late and apologised, sharing that she had been unable to sleep for hours the night before after learning that the phone was calling authorities.

The phone is the landline for her Upper East Side apartment in New York, and is still registered in the name of her late husband, Jay Monahan, who passed away from colon cancer in 1998.

A friend said that Couric just never changed it to her name after her husband passed away.

Couric said the phone had been calling 911, sending a single patrol car to her apartment. She would get an automatic call back to her apartment with a 911 operator on the line, the Daily News reported.

Speaking to the audience, she said it was a 'SWAT' call, like prank calls that have sent entire SWAT teams to the Los Angeles homes of Ashton Kutcher and Tom Cruise, among others.

Couric told the audience that most of the calls have been placed when she is not even there.

'It's happened like three times the last three weeks,' she said. 'Every day, every time at 2 a.m. on 
Tuesday morning. I was out of town the last time it happened and 
apparently it happened before when nobody was home.'

She said that it was particularly disturbing because the calls were made on her late husband's landline, and she was unable to sleep until 4.30 a.m. that morning.

'I got no sleep, so I am just oversharing,' she told the audience, who laughed, the Daily News said.

After learning of the calls, Couric first told staff in her building and they decided she should contact the local precinct, but she also decided to call Commissioner Ray Kelly.

One audience member recalled: 'She said, "That is one of the perks of 
being well-known, that you can get through to Ray Kelly." And she said 
Ray Kelly told her that you have to respond to these things, and that 
the NYPD would investigate it.'

A police source confirmed to the paper that the matter is under investigation, and authorities are trying to determine whether there is a fault with the phone or whether she is the victim of a prank.

A friend of Couric's added that the host
is worried that police might be put off from responding to her home in 
the case of a real emergency.

Couric was married to Monahan, a lawyer and NBC News legal analyst, from 1989 until his death, and has since worked to raise awareness of colon cancer. In 2000, she had a colonoscopy on air.

Following his death, she dated Brooks Perlin, who was 17 years her junior, for five years, and has most recently been linked to wealthy financier John Molner.

Couric, 56, lives at the home with her daughters, aged 21 and 17, and their dogs.
