A family has adorned each of their Down Abbey-style country mansion's 52 rooms with a lavishly decorated Christmas tree... and it's taken a whole month.

Paul Humpherston, 67, and his wife Victoria, 63, who own Abbey Cwm-Hir Hall have filled all their drawing rooms, bedrooms and even toilets with beautifully decorated trees to celebrate the festive season.

And to do so, they had to close the Grade II* listed Abbey for an entire month to decorate each room in line with its own theme.

One fashionable fir is covered in handbags and shoes and there's also a Royal Dalton tree covered in fine china and a crystal tree shimmering in Christmas lights.

Paul Humpherston, 67, and his wife Victoria, 63, have spent a month putting up lavish Christmas trees in every room in Abbey-Cwm-Hir Hall

The owners said it takes a month and a small army of helpers, including Sandra Thomas, pictured, to decorate all 52 rooms of the country mansion in Powys, Wales

Victoria adds the finishing touches to a display of reindeer and presents. Every room in the mansion is open to visitors until January 6

The couple bought the Downton Abbey-style mansion for just £495,000 in 1997 and then spent a decade on renovating the property

But while there are 70 trees in total, with as many as four in some of the rooms, the owner admits they're all artificial. 

Paul said: 'It takes a small army of helpers from the local village a whole month to help us decorate the house but it is all worth when the visitors arrive.

'We have all 52 rooms decorated to individual themes and each room has at least one Christmas tree - but some have as many as four. We have 70 trees in total.

'But I admit they are all artificial trees - because we couldn't handle that amount of pine needles in the carpets.

'We keep 40 of them stored under the billiard table during the rest of the year.

'This is quite an extraordinary place and the Christmas decorations take people's breath away.'

The Abbey, near Llandrindod Wells, Powys, was built as a Cistercian monastery in 1143 and is the burial place of the last two independent princes of Wales.

Paul and Victoria bought the house in 1997 for just £495,000 and spent the next 10 years renovating the property which came with just two mirrors, two chandeliers and a billiard tables.

The couple, who are originally from Kingsbury in Warwickshire, turned the mansion into a perfectly decorated haven filled with collectibles and treasures, which attracts visitors from all over the country.

The Abbey is open to visitors who have access to all 52 decorated rooms until January 6. The only days they are closed is on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.

Retired business director Paul said: 'The grandchildren love the house at Christmas - it turns into a real winter wonderland. In our eyes you can never have too many trees for Christmas.'

The couple, pictured with the Royal Dalton tree, said all 70 trees are artificial as the upkeep of real trees would prove too much trouble
