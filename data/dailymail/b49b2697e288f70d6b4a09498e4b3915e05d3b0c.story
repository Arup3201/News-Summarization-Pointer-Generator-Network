You can search far and wide for the answer to a problem, but sometimes it is right under your nose.

When Arsene Wenger sent Francis Coquelin on loan to Charlton in November it looked to be the final nail in the Frenchman's Arsenal career.

The Gunners manager admitted as much recently, revealing he was prepared to let the midfielder leave in December.

But a spate of injuries in midfield saw Wenger recall Coquelin in December. The 23-year-old hasn't looked back.

He's grasped his chance to become a key member of Arsenal's midfield with both hands, despite his reluctance to return to Arsenal from Charlton fearing he'd simply be warming the bench.

There's an argument to suggest he's the most vital component in Wenger's plans at the present moment; the central midfield enforcer they've been crying out for in recent years.

Just weeks after his Arsenal career looked to be drawing to a close, Coquelin is on the verge of agreeing a new long-term contract to stay at the Emirates Stadium.

Wenger would like to say Coquelin's emergence has been pre-planned; a managerial masterstroke that has helped Arsenal turn their stuttering league form around.

But that is far from the case.

Following three substitute appearances after his return from the Valley, Coquelin was handed a rare start against West Ham on December 28 in place of the injured Mathieu Flamini.

He hasn't looked back. His energetic and mature displays alongside Santi Cazorla in central midfield have been a revelation - none more so than in the win at Manchester City in January.

The concern with Coquelin has always been about his physical stature.

Can his slender frame handle the rough and tumble of Premier League football? He's answered those questions unequivocally in recent weeks.

Having fractured his nose in the recent win over Everton, the midfielder insisted upon playing on - only coming off in injury time after taking another blow to the face.

Three days later he was back on the pitch, sporting a protective mask, in the narrow win over Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road.

He's waited so long to prove himself in an Arsenal shirt, Coquelin's won't let a broken nose keep him on the sidelines now.

The big question is whether Coquelin is the long-term answer to Wenger's holding midfielder conundrum.

After failing to sign an enforcer last summer, the Gunners will be back in the market for a midfield ball winner once more at the end of the season despite Coquelin's emergence.

Morgan Schneiderlin, for the time being, is favourite to land the role provided Arsenal can strike a deal with Southampton, who will want at least £25milliom.

That would leave Coquelin's regular place in Wenger's team selections under threat.

For now Coquelin will be focusing on keeping his place in the team until the end of the season.

The returns of Aaron Ramsey and Jack Wilshere following injury spells will cast further questions over the Frenchman's role.

But, for now, the shirt is Coquelin's to lose. Having waited so long for this chance - he'll be desperate to keep it that way.
