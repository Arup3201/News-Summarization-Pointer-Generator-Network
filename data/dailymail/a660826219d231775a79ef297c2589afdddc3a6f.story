The number of horses slaughtered in UK abattoirs has almost doubled in just four years as cash-strapped owners struggle with feed and stabling costs.

As a government investigation continues into horsemeat finding its way into supermarket burgers, shocking new figures reveal the extent of horsemeat production in mainland Britain.

Last year more than 9,400 horses were sent to abattoirs in the UK, up 84 per cent since 2009.

New figures revealed the sharp rise in the number of horses slaughtered in the UK has almost doubled in four years, amid a growing row about horse meat found in British burgers

The RSPCA has warned of hundreds of horses being abandoned and neglected as owners struggle with feed bills

Animal welfare campaigners have warned of a ‘crisis’ in the number of pet animals, including horses, being abandoned or put down because owners can no longer afford the costs of looking after them.

New figures released in Parliament reveal 9,405 horses were slaughtered in UK abattoirs in 2012, up 400 from 2011, and a rise of more than 4,300 on the 5,100 slaughtered in 2009.

The RSPCA has reported a ‘massive’ 65 per cent increase in the number of animals abandoned in the last five years.

Labour’s Mary Creagh, the shadow 
environment secretary, said: ‘The number of horses slaughtered in the UK 
has nearly doubled in the last four years.

‘We know from animal welfare charities 
that people are struggling to feed their pets, including dogs and cats 
and obviously horses are very, very expensive to keep and feed.'

Revelations about contaminated meat in burgers has raised doubts about the security of the food chain (file picture)

The sharp increase in horses sent to abattoirs was revealed by farming minister David Heath, who has faced repeated questions in parliament since it emerged Tesco value burgers contained 29.1 per cent horse DNA.

Around 10million beef burgers have since been withdrawn from sale by supermarkets, and other smaller retailers in the UK, since the scandal, which centred around the Silvercrest factory, in County Monaghan, broke earlier this month.

Last week Labour claimed a drug that can cause cancer in humans may have entered the food chain through horse meat slaughtered in UK abattoirs.

Miss Creagh revealed she had evidence that 'several' horses slaughtered in the UK last year tested positive for the carcinogen phenylbutazone, known as bute.

She added: ‘The revelation on Friday that horsemeat contaminated with Bute had been exported and eaten in France raises the question about the adequacy of the meat testing regime and our approach to dealing with this neglected part of the food chain.’
