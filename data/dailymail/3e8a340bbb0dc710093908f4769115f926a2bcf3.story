A teenage skateboarder has died after he was hit by a train while being followed by police.

The 16-year-old, named locally as Mitchell Rodgers, had just been spoken to by officers who were continuing to follow him 'from a distance away' when he was hit by a passing train near Belper Railway Station in Derbyshire.

He died at the scene at just before 10pm on Saturday in what has been described by police as a 'tragic accident.' 

A teenage skateboarder, named locally as Mitchell Rodgers, has died after he was hit by a train in Belper, Derbyshire, while being followed by police

Officers are thought to have spoken to a number of other teenagers, including Mitchell, following an 'incident' in the town centre.

Det Ch Insp Julian Wilson said: 'We don't believe it was a deliberate act. We are investigating it as a tragic accident.'

The case had been passed to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) watchdog. 

Derbyshire Police confirmed the teenager was a pupil at the John Flamsteed Community School in Denby. 

A spokeswoman said: 'Shortly after the officers arrived, a collision occurred between a male and a train close to Belper train station.

'The man was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene. Derbyshire Constabulary is now preparing a file for the coroner and the force has also referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.'

A Facebook page has since been set up in memory of Mitchell to help create a memorial for the teenager. 

Shannon Rodgers, who has identified herself as Mitchell's sister, said she wanted to thank the community. She said: 'I would like everyone to know we really appreciate everything that's being done for Mitch it's lovely how much everyone can pull together!'

On the fund-raising page, Stephanie Shaw said: 'Taken to soon! You will be missed by many!'

Verity Adams added: 'RIP Mitch, thoughts are with your friends and especially your family.'

A memorial page has since been set up to the teenager who was a keen skateboarder, to try and raise money for a memorial 

And Peter Urbacz offered his services to help in building a memorial.

He said: 'There are no words, but acts of kindness might ease the pain. RIP from a fellow skateboarder who never met Mitchell but would respectfully like to offer his service as a woodworker if required in the proposed skatepark bench. My heart goes out his family at this tragic and senseless time.'

And on Facebook Rebecca Child offered her condolences to the family. 

She said: 'I am very sorry to hear what happened to this what looks like an amazing young man my thoughts are with his family and friends.' 

Chris Smith, who stated he was the teenager's uncle, wrote: 'My nephew didn't take his own life. It was an accident. He was a great 16-year-old lad.'

He said tributes had been paid for him at the town's skate park on Sunday.

Mr Smith wrote: 'Excellent turnout in support of the family. We really do thank people for their support.' 

Another post stated that the fund had been set up for people to donate money for Mitchell's funeral and for a bench to be made in his memory. 

A message left on the fund raising page said: 'Mitchell Rogers was a sweet, young, 16-year-old boy, who tragically died.

'Mitchell was hit by a train and the family have been in pieces ever since.

'The community want to raise funds for a bench or plaque to be made in remembrance of this bright boy - and money towards funeral arrangements and flowers.

'No-one deserves to die the way this boy did and we want to help the families left behind after this awful accident.'
