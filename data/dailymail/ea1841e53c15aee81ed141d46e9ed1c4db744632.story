Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has changed his mind over his side's main aim this season as the Dutchman is now prioritising Champions League qualification over winning the FA Cup.

Van Gaal, who has been criticised during the course of the season for constantly tinkering with Manchester United's tactical approach, said back in February that winning the FA Cup was his side's main objective.

The Dutchman, speaking after Manchester United's 3-0 win against Cambridge United on February 3, said: ‘We have a real chance now.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal appears to have changed his mind over his side's main priority

‘Why? We are the highest qualified team in the FA Cup so people are maybe betting on us. I am not allowed to (bet), I am not a casino man – but I give you a tip.

‘Of course, I think the highest qualified teams have more possibilities to win than lower qualified teams. But Arsenal is still in the cup and Liverpool will fight tomorrow (Wednesday, February 4).

‘For me, personally, I have always won a title in my first year everywhere I have worked so the chance of winning the title is bigger in the FA Cup than the Premier League.

‘Every club in the FA Cup wants to win, and so do we. For the club, the fans and the coach and my staff, we want to win a title this year. The biggest chance is the FA Cup, but we still have to win four games to do that.’

However Van Gaal, speaking ahead of his side's quarter-final clash against Arsenal, now insists finishing in the top four is more important than winning a piece of silverware.

Van Gaal said: 'I always want to get the goals what we have set. And the goals we have set is the top four.

'A title is fantastic. When you win the FA Cup you are not in the Champions League which is important for the club, but you have won a title. So for the players it is fantastic, for the manager it is fantastic but our goal is to reach in our first year together a place in the Champions League. 

'I think that for a club the Champions League is the highest level. To finish in the first four is a fantastic result, I think. And for us, Manchester United, more I think.'
