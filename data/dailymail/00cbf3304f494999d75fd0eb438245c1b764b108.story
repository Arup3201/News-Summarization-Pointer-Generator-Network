This song couldn't be a more fitting track for this tuneful dog.

Shelby the German Shepherd decided to perform a rendition of Maroon 5's Animals while taking a ride in the back seat of the car recently.

As the chorus breaks, the canine produces a loud howl in sync with singer Adam Levine.

'Is this your song?' Shelby's owner Christie asks in an American accent as she films the performance unfold.

After she's finished her singing session, the pet gets a big 'good job' for her efforts.

To date the video of Shelby howling away has been watched more than 18,000 times

Many viewers have applauded her vocal ability.

'That's cute.Good job Shelby!' one commenter wrote. The artistic animal lives in America - although it isn't clear exactly where -  with her owners, Christie and Brian. There's no word of a record deal just yet.
