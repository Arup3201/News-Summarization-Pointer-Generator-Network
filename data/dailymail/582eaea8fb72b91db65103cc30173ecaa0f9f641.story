Ionut Tudorache (pictured) was caught with 22 stolen mobile phones stuffed down his trousers just days after arriving in Britain

A Romanian pickpocket has been jailed after he admitted stealing 22 mobile phones  just days after arriving in Britain.

Ionut Tudorache, 25, was part of an organised gang that targeted music fans at a Kasabian gig, stealing their phones while they were dancing.

He wore a pair of tights hidden under his jeans which acted as a net to hold the devices, but claimed he didn't realise what was happening until two Romanians he had befriended starting stuffing the phones down his tights.

Immigrant Tudorache had only been in the UK a few days when he committed the crime at the concert at Bournemouth International Centre in Dorset.

He was caught when he aroused the suspicions of the BIC's security team, who stopped and searched him then found the phones down the pair of tights.

Staff at the venue had been on red alert following similar incidents at the band's previous gigs there, Bournemouth Crown Court heard.

Stuart Ellacott, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant drew the attention of the security guards by not making eye contact.

'He was stopped and searched, and the mobile phones were found in a pair of tights he was wearing underneath his trousers.'

Despite the fact he committed the crime just days after arriving in Britain, he is unlikely to be deported due to strict laws on removing EU citizens.

Without a court recommendation or tougher prison sentence, he can now only be removed at the behest of the Home Secretary.

Nicholas Robinson, defending, told the court that Tudorache had not physically taken the phones from their owners at the concert.

He claimed Tudorache had been recruited by two Romanians when he had arrived in London and travelled with them to Bournemouth.

Mr Robinson said Tudorache, a qualified electromechanical engineer, had not known what he was getting involved until the men he was with started putting the phones down his tights at the gig on November 25 last year.

He said: 'My client was not the pickpocket who actually stole the phones.

'He came here hoping for a better life. He had been in London for three or four days and he didn't know anyone.

'He met two Romanian gentlemen and he came down to Bournemouth with them.

'He was told to wear the tights because it would be cold on the south coast.'

Tudorache, of no fixed abode, admitted 22 counts of theft of a mobile phone.

In jailing him for nine months, Judge John Harrow said: 'You had been in this country a matter of days before you broke the law. You must have known that you were being dishonest.'

The incident is the latest in a spate of attacks on concert-goers by criminal gangs.

Thieves have previously targeted fans at concerts by bands such as Oasis, Kings of Leon, Stereophonics and Sugababes at the BIC.

Steve Turner, general manager at Bournemouth International Centre, said: 'This prosecution sends out a clear message that we do not tolerate theft.

'This particular type of crime affects venues across the UK and our team and security services are working closely with the police to crack down on perpetrators.

'We also encourage our visitors to keep an eye on their belongings at all times.'
