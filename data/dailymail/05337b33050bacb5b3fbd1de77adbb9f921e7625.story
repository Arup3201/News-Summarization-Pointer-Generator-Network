Theresa May showed her naked ambition ahead of the next election when she tried to sweet talk a voter on the doorstep, who was wearing nothing but a towel.

The Home Secretary was on the campaign trail in Norwich supporting local MP Chloe Smith when she knocked on the door of a surprised man who had just got out of the bath.

The blushing minister apologised for the inconvenient timing of the call, but then professionally pressed on with her pitch for a Conservative vote in 2015.

Bad time: The Home Secretary was saw more than she expected to of this surprised voter

Yes, Minister: The man told May that she had called at a bad time, but she still managed to hand him a leaflet

But, while a giggling May seemed to see the funny side of the situation, the constituent did not.

When the politician asked if she could run the resident through some of her policies, the unnamed man said: 'No you can't! You've called at a bad time!'.

Determined Mrs May did not let a little embarrassment stand in the way of the job, though.

She still managed to pop a party leaflet through the door of the house in Albany Road, before the flustered voter managed to close it and return to his mid-afternoon soak.

Laughing it off: The Home Secretary and her colleague, Smith, saw the funny side of the surprise encounter

Mrs was May knocking doors in Miss Smith's Norwich North constituency, which is seen as a vulnerable seat by Labour.

Talking about her visit to the city, the Home Secretary said: 'I'm pleased to be here to head out with Chloe and talk to local people and police about crime in the area.

'I spent a lot of time in North Norwich for the 2009 by-election which Chloe held, which I was very pleased about because I think Chloe is an excellent MP.'
