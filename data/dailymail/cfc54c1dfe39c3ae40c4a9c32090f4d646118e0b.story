Breona Moore, 22, who was sent to prison in April for impersonating a nurse and abducting a newborn from Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh has died from natural causes

A western Pennsylvania woman who was sent to prison for impersonating a nurse and abducting a newborn from a Pittsburgh hospital has died.

Twenty-two-year-old Breona Moore of East McKeesport died late last week at Geisinger Medical Center in Danville, officials said. 

Montour County Coroner Scott Lynn told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that Moore died of natural causes.

Moore was serving a 2 ½- to-five-year sentence at Muncy state prison after pleading guilty in April to kidnapping a 3-day-old boy from Magee-Women's Hospital at UPMC.

Moore, who was 5-foot-4 and 230 pounds, had told friends for weeks that she was pregnant, prosecutors said.

On Aug. 23, 2012, dressed in hospital scrubs, Moore walked into the mother's hospital room and told her she was taking the baby for a medical test. 

Instead, she placed him in a handbag and carried him out of the hospital, prompting a frantic search for the missing child that lasted for several hours.

Police found Moore holding the baby, who was not harmed, in a janitor's closet in a downtown office building.

At her sentencing in June, Moore told the judge she became depressed after a doctor told her she would be unable to have children of her own. 

She apologized for her actions and to the baby's mother, even though she was not in the courtroom.

'I hope I will be as blessed as you some day,' Moore said. 'There are no words to say how remorseful I am.'

In August 2012, dressed in hospital scrubs, Moore had walked into a mom's hospital room at Magee-Women's Hospital in Pittsburgh and told her she was taking the baby for a medical test
