Argentina's president wasted little time in  launching a new attack in Britain over the Falkland Islands after returning to work following a cancer scare.

Cristina Fernandez showed off the deep scar from an operation to remove her thyroid after what proved to be a false cancer diagnosis, during a broadcast to the nation.

She then turned on British Prime Minister David Cameron, who angered Argentines while she was away by accusing them of having ‘colonialist’ attitudes toward the Falklands.

During the speech, she said: ‘I heard they're calling us colonialist. ... One is always tempted to respond, but I think it's better to avoid it. When they say these things it's exactly because they don't have reasons or arguments.’

Argentina has called on Britain to negotiate the sovereignty of the remote South Atlantic archipelago it calls the Malvinas.

Britain has maintained a military presence there since liberating the islands in 1982 from an ill-fated Argentine attempt to take them back.

Some British analysts have accused Argentines of saber-rattling as the 30th anniversary of that war nears, but Fernandez has insisted on a peaceful resolution.

She took another step, announcing that she's making public the ‘Rattenbach Report,’ a long-secret analysis of Argentine leadership failures that called the war a ‘military adventure’ and recommended criminal penalties for those responsible.

The report was prepared in 1982, just before the end of Argentina's dictatorship, but was kept classified to keep anyone from being punished.

Fernandez sought to draw a clear line between what she called the militarism of other governments and the democracy she leads.

‘Next year will mark 180 years since the usurpation by the government of United Kingdom, which threw out the Argentines who were there (on the islands). They want to make us out to be the bad and violent little ones, something we're not,’ she said.

Twice in recent days, pro-government 
protesters have been pushed back by riot police from the British Embassy
in Buenos Aires, chanting and carrying signs demanding that Britain 
turn over the islands. Falklanders have responded that they have nothing
in common with the Argentines.

She noted that there are more British 
people living in Buenos Aires than on the disputed islands, and praised 
the many British businesses located in Argentina.

‘I would advise 
Cameron to have a little talk with the executives of these businesses, 
so that they can tell him how we Argentines are.’

Fernandez's last public appearance had 
been December 28, the day after her office announced the cancer diagnosis. 
Doctors removed the entire gland January 4 after discovering several more 
lumps during surgery. Tests then showed the growths were benign.

She said: ‘I was going to come with a 
handkerchief because it doesn't look very aesthetic,’ she said, 
referring to a deep horizontal crease just above her collarbone that 
appears to have healed nicely during her 20-day medical leave.

But I thought, if I cover it up with a handkerchief, tomorrow Clarin will say, 'This woman wasn't operated on,’ she joked. ‘You all know that aesthetics are very important to me, but I told myself, 'Sweetie, politics before style.’'

Questions raised by the newspaper Clarin and other opposition media about her diagnosis and operation had prompted Fernandez to release her medical records, reinforcing what her doctors.
