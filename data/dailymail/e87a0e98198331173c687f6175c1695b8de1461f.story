What property can you buy for £1 million? Not as much as you might think, depending on where you want to buy.

A British real-estate site has revealed how much property you get for your million across the UK.

A luxury cottage in Scotland a converted church in Manchester or a one bedroom apartment in Covent Garden - geography seems to be the key to how much luxury pad you can purchase for £1,000,000. 

£1 million could see you living in this property in Covent Garden, a reasonable sized flat with a kitchen nook, and a separate bathroom and bedroom. Alternately you could buy a mansion elsewhere

The living room in the Covent Garden property does boast a lot of living room space due to the smaller size of the kitchen, and has room for its own small dining table

Bit of a squeeze: The kitchen in the Covent Garden flat is a little on the small side, sacrificing the space of the kitchen for having a more open plan living room

The bathroom clearly utilises an extensive use of mirrors to give it the impression of more space. The bathroom features a small sink, bath and toilet with tiled walls

The bedroom has enough room to fit a bed and two small bedside tables, as well as a chest of drawers. The entire flat is more based around location than space

The Covent Garden flat sacrifices space for the convenience and location that the streets of London can provide

£1 million will buy you just a one bedroom apartment in the heart of 
Covent Garden, Crown Court, in between Bow Street and Drury Lane.

The flat comprises a combined living and dining room, separate kitchen, good size bedroom and large bathroom.

Alternately, if you move to Manchester you can
 purchase a unique 9 storey apartment in based in St George's Church, 
Castlefield, which covers the entire square footage of the clock tower.

2500 sq ft of unique accomodation comes with a gym, sauna, and roof terrace on the top of the clock tower.

The entire Gothic church and all of its new mod cons are available to buy for a small £1 million, the same price that could get you a 20 room property elsewhere

The church property: The dining room clearly shows the arches of the church design, with modern features such as glass tiled flooring and spot lighting

The converted Gothic church in Manchester is significantly more opulent than what one could afford in London

The kitchen of the church property, which features a glass tiled roof. The kitchen can be viewed from the dining room above it through the glass, and vice-versa

The bedroom of the church property seems takes design risks such as a raised and sunken bed, in order to be more appealing to the buyer

£1 million properties: The size of properties worth £1 million would appear to change depending on how far they are from cities. Smaller properties are based in or near cities, like the property in London, while larger properties can be based in the peace and quiet of the country, like the Scottish property

In Bangor, North Wales, £1million would get you this idyllic five bed, three-story, detached house in the hills.

The converted Edwardian house's glass 
windows boasts views over the water to Anglesey - there is a luxurious 
wood burner in the living room and double doors looking out over the 
water.

The living room of the Bangor property, which boasts riverside views, as well as views of a bridge further down the river. The house seems like a new build and has several different mod cons that reflect this

The property also features a large garden and deck that looks out over a harbour near Anglesey

The north Wales property also features its own route to the riverside, and a small rock jetty that protrudes from the hillside

The bedroom in the north Wales property has it's own little balcony, and dwarfs other smaller properties, being almost double the size as bedrooms in flats and houses in London

The property features a few spare rooms that can be used for multiple functions. The advertiser has decided to opt for a pool table in an attempt to re-purpose it as a rec room

The north Wales property features many rooms, but most have a view of the river, or architecturally significant bridge a short way down the river

You can always tell the size of a place immediately by the size of its entrance and hallway. This one is massive, which makes it likely that so is the house

In Kinross-shire in Scotland you can snap up a 20-room state-of-the-art four bed cottage.

The detached family villa with a 4-car
 garage and staff flat is within easy reach of Edinburgh and has a three
 acre woodland to the north of the house.

A property in Kinross-shire in Scotland features 20 rooms, one of which is a classically Scottish wooden snooker room that looks over the large amount of land that comes with the property

Larch cottage in Scotland also boasts a small wooded area to the rear of the property, as well as a bird cage and several acres of land

Much of the property in Scotland is lined with wooden panelling, mixing the newer styles of fittings, such as a gym, with the older style of using wood as a wall and ceiling surface

The Scottish cottage is a newer build that attempts to capture a flair of old-style design, and has heavy emphasis on recreation and entertainment rooms

The bedroom is a much more pre-fab modern design than other bedrooms in properties worth £1 million or more. The price of some properties increases because of size, whereas other property prices increase because of location

The property also has a cinema room for those who decide that going to the cinema is too expensive after they have paid £1 million for their house

The Scottish property also has a small garage that could easily function as a guest house

The kitchen has a large island to both do cooking and eat at leisure, with large fridges and cupboards

The British real estate market rarely has buyers of £1 million or more, which is why these sorts of properties are so rare, and also tend to sell a lot slower

Alternatively you could multiply your million and buy 12 apartments in Withington, Manchester.

The pair of grand Victorian semi-detached
 properties are converted into one and two bed apartments and are fully 
let - generating £70,000 a year.

The flats, if fully occupied, could possibly generate around £70,000 a year, meaning you could earn your investment back in around 10 or 11 years

An alternative to buying a house for yourself is buying property to rent out. By buying this property in Manchester, you could turn the floors into flats and rent it out

The Manchester flats a re a lot more like an investment than a place to live, causing a potential buyer to spend a lot more money doing up the flats than they might by just buying a house for themselves

In Bristol you can become the owners of a nine bedroom manor house in the Somerset hills.

Built in 1450 this beautiful manor house in a tiny village is straight out of a romance novel.

The huge property has mullioned windows, four foot thick walls, numerous fireplaces, exposed beams and flagstone flooring.

The Victorian property based in Somerset, just outside of Bristol, is likely marketed at someone who appreciates the tastes and styles of the Victorian era, as the house is crammed head to toe with memorabilia from Britain's era of empire

The property in Bristol, Somerset, is a lot more of a cosy affair. It features plush ornaments and wooden beams, with the expensive price being based on the age and size of the property rather than the location

The property follows a very Victorian theme, reflecting the time it was built and a buyer will likely be someone who enjoys the sort of taste that the advertising displays

With nine bedrooms and several reception rooms, the property would be perfect for entertaining guests who have similar tastes around a roaring fire on a cold winter's evening

The Somerset property is a lot more rustic, with older features including an aga a giant dining table, and flagstone floors

The property also features a large garden, with the advert displaying a manicured lawn that would probably require a lot of work to maintain

The Somerset house is situated in a cosy village that is only a short distance from Bristol, giving it the pleasures of the country with the convenience of being near the city

The bedrooms are spread across the wide property, which would make it incredibly quiet if there were a smaller amount of people living at the house

Rightmove is one of Britain's biggest websites for property searches in the UK, where you can find out what you can buy for £1million in 2014.

Matthew James from property site Rightmove, said: 'There are currently nearly 800 homes on Right move priced at exactly £1million, and these examples show just how much location can determine what you can get for your money.

'A recent survey found that 90% of people weren't willing to compromise on location, but whether your budget is £100,000 or £1million.

'By broadening your search to include different are as you might find that you're able to get more of the features that are on your home moving wish list.'
