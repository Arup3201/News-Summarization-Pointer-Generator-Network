Those pleased with the success of their efforts to shave off the weight in January might want to look away now.

Because all of their hard work could be undone by this 1ft tall burger, should they take on the challenge to eat it in just 20 minutes.

But those who tackle it can shrug off some of the guilt - because the gigantic test is all for the sake of raising money for a cancer charity.

Mounds of meat This is the monster burger challenge that gives you just 20 minutes to try and defeat the massive 2.25lbs burger

Measuring in at a foot tall and loaded with six burgers, six slices of bacon, six onion rings, cheese and salad, this is not one for the faint-hearted

The competitor will have just twenty minutes to plough through six 6oz beef burgers, topped with six rashers of bacon, six deep fried battered onion rings, six slices of cheese and six rings of fresh onion.

All the fillings are nestled in a bun with relish, mustard and a hefty portion of spicy chilli beef.

They will also have to tackle a portion of Cajun seasoned thick cut chips at the Redditch pub.

But there is a healthy side to it - it also contains six mushrooms and six slices of tomato and lettuce.

Meat lovers will have 20 minutes to demolish the mountain of food at The Duck Inn pub in Oakenshaw.

Since the challenge was launched last month, 12 people have tried to tackle the burger but no one has managed to clear off their plate

And if they succeed they will be rewarded with a t-shirt, certificate and their photograph will take pride of place on the pub's hall of fame.

The owners, Ashley and Louise Gargan, came up with the idea to develop the Man VS Duck Burger challenge because their customers wanted to see bigger steaks and burgers on their menu.

But Ashley said people who did not complete the challenge could take their leftovers home, so no food is wasted, The Daily Star reported.

The challenge costs Â£19.50 and must be pre-ordered, with a percentage of the money going to Macmillan Cancer Support.

Since the challenge was launched last month, 12 people have tried to tackle the burger but no one has managed to clear off their plate and claim their winning t- shirt.

Perhaps competitors could take inspiration from American mother Molly Schuyler.

The slender mother-of-four has managed to demolish a five-pound meat sandwich three times - a when Man Vs Food presenter Adam Rickman failed to swallow just one.

Mrs Schuyler, 33, from Bellevue, Nebraska, had successfully completed the gut-busting challenge at Jethro's BBQ diner in Iowa, since Mr Rickman's failed attempt in 2010.

The female competitive eater chowed down the grease-infused stack - featuring hunks of pork, chicken, bacon, brisket and deep fried cheese - in just seven minutes and 53 seconds.
