The age-old saying 'waste not want not' has been heard around dinner tables for generations.

And one man is hoping to prove just how waste can be put to good use, after coming up with a recipe for badger casserole in response to the government's plans to cull the animals.

Arthur Boyt, from Davidstow, Cornwall, has been eating roadkill for over 50 years, and sees no reason why culled badgers should be taken off the menu.

Arthur Boyt has been eating discarded roadkill since he was 13. One of his favourite snacks is a badger sandwich

He said: 'I'm against the cull - but it would be ridiculous not to use the dead badgers. Badger makes a pretty good meal.'

'I don't agree with the killing of badgers, unless scientists can prove without a shadow of a doubt that they cause harm to cattle.

'But I was left wondering, what are they going to do with the tonnes of fully edible badger meat from perfectly healthy animals they have shot?

'I've eaten badger for 55 years and I certainly haven't got tuberculosis. As with all meat you just make sure you cook it long and hot enough to kill any bugs.

'Badgers are fully edible, and their meat could be used to feed the hungry rather than being chucked in a furnace, I can't see any point in that.'

Mr Boyt from Davidstow, Cornwall, doesn't agree with the shooting of badgers but sees no point in their meat going to waste

Though Mr Boyt sees no issue in eating dead animals, he does not kill them himself but rather picks them up from the side of the road after they have been run over on roads around his home in Bodmin Moor, Cornwall.

His long-suffering wide, Sue Boyt, 59, does not share his taste in meat however as she is a vegetarian.

Mr Boyt collects the animals with a shovel, skins them and cuts the meat into joints, often making them into a stew or sandwich.

His diet regularly includes fox, hare, sparrow, deer, pigeon and even a porcupine he brought back from a holiday in Canada.

The unusual way of dining isn't fattening either, as despite eating three meals a day Mr Boyt weighs just over nine stone. 

He said: 'People are happy to eat an apple which has fallen out of the tree - so what's the difference? Just because it hasn't got a label on doesn't mean it's not edible.'

Mr Boyt's eating habits began when he was 13, after he discovered a dead pheasant in a park.

'I took it home and asked mum to cook it and it was delicious.'

Stop the cull: Protestors in the Somerset village of Monksilver patrol fields in a bid to prevent culling

Since 1992 it has been illegal to kill badgers in Britain, but there is no law which deems it illegal to eat them once they are already dead.

The badger cull has divided opinion in Somerset where shooting began on Monday. It is expected that 5,000 of the species will be killed in the cull. Plans for a second shoot in Gloucestershire have been put on hold.

Protestors have been monitoring setts and patrolling their communities at nightfall to prevent the cull which is intended to stop badgers infecting cattle with tuberculosis.

Liz Gaffer, a spokeswoman for Gloucestershire Against Badger Shooting said: 'These are not animal rights extremists, they are just normal people who are concerned about how humane this cull is.'

Ingredients

Two badger hams, potatoes, broccoli, a big onion, sliced carrot, cooking oil, parsnip, flour, salt, pepper, spices, tomatoes  

Mr Boyt's recipe involves skinning a badger and cooking its body parts with tomatoes, carrots and wine among other things

'Skin the badger in the garage as this stops the fleas getting all round the house.

'Take off the hind legs with as much back muscle as possible and this will give you two good hams weighing around 3lbs.

'The hams will have a good covering of fat and this will serve to baste the meat during cooking. If you are having a big crowd to dinner, add the forelegs, shoulder and, if need be, the neck as well.

'Dredge the hams in seasoned flour, put a little oil into a casserole dish and lightly fry the meat on both sides. Remove the meat and fry the onion until it is golden.

'Slice the spuds and parsnip, put them on the onion and chuck in the tomatoes.

'Put the meat on top and pour on a cup of cider/wine/stock with the remains of the seasoned flour. Bring to the boil, cover and simmer for five minutes. 

'Place in a hot oven for an hour to an hour and a half. Alternatively you can put it in a slow oven or in the bottom of the AGA for 3hrs and go out for a good walk to work up an appetite.

'Add the chopped up carrots and put it back in the oven for half an hour.

'Boil a pan of broccoli (or greens of your choice) for five minutes.'

Spoon off any fat or oil from the casserole and serve the meat on the bone with the sauce.
