Two troopers have been injured after falling from a tree stand during the manhunt for cop-killer Eric Frein three weeks after his murderous rampage at a Pennsylvania barracks. 

State Police claim self-trained survivalist Frein, 31, appears to be under-pressure and getting careless, leaving clear tracks which the team is following.

But last night they were forced to halt proceedings to call a Medivac helicopter after two troopers fell 20 feet while searching for the fugitive in a tree house.

According to authorities, the men had entered the tree stand to check that it was clear.

State police said the floor collapsed and both men fell to the ground and were treated by tactical medics at the scene.

It comes just a day after the team found two potentially lethal pipe bombs hidden deep in the woods that could have detonated at any point. 

Trooper Connie Devens said the injuries sustained in the accident on Wednesday night are non-life threatening.

A massive manhunt has been underway for 31-year-old Eric Frein in the rugged terrain of the Pocono Mountains since September 12 - and there is no sign of a foreseeable end to the hunt.

The self-taught survivalist is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass outside their barracks in Blooming Grove.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers have been searching an area near Frein's home in Canadensis.  

On Tuesday, Lt Col George Bivens said his team found bombs were covered in metal nuts designed as shrapnel.

'They could cause significant injury. They could be fatal,' said Bivens.

But Bivens said he is confident that Frein is getting desperate and careless, leaving behind items that he may need in a future battle with the police he has vowed to kill.

The two bombs were not deployed, Bivens said, but they were fully functional and could be set off either by a fuse or a trip wire. One of them was in a plastic bag.

'It is typical of his non-confrontational and gutless efforts to kill or injure law enforcement from a distance,' said Bivens. 'All of this indicates that we are putting significant pressure on him.' 

Bivens said he believes Frein left behind some items as cops move in.

'He abandoned them because he was under pressure. It was not from his own choosing,' he said. 'He may very well be looking for a fight. He already picked the fight.'

Explosive experts in the Pennsylvania State Police are now examining the bombs.

'They have assured me they are fully functional devices,' Bevins added.

All day Monday, officers looked in an area behind the Barrett Elementary Center, a school which closed last year. FBI officers on camouflage went in and out of land around the Pasold Farms Natural Preserve.

But all they found was a married couple who had gone into the woods to get a closer look at the searchers. The couple was given a reprimand and hauled out of the search area.

By Tuesday, officers had returned to the area around Snow Hill Road, where earlier Bivens had said they had Frein contained in a five-square mile area.

Cops say Frein then made his getaway in a green 2001 Jeep but crashed it into a swamp two miles north of the barracks. They say he then made his way on foot 25 miles through dense forest back to the area close to the home he shared with his parents and teenage sister.

Over the past week they have found an AK-47 that was missing from his home along with soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarette.

Frein is known to have read survivalist literature that advises wearing a diaper to allow someone to remain in place over extended periods, leading to locals dubbing him the 'diaper sniper.'
