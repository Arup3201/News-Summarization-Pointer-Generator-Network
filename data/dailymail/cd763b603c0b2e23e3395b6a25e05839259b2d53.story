Dallas Cowboys' Josh Brent today looked pained as he arrived at a memorial for his teammate Jerry Brown, who died on Saturday as an allegedly intoxicated Brent flipped his car.

Team owner Jerry Jones was also in attendance as Brent leaned on friends for support and hugged well wishers outside the service at Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas on Tuesday afternoon.

Brown's mother, Stacey Jackson, had requested Brent meet her grieving family at the airport and sit with them at the memorial service, Jones had revealed on Tuesday morning.

'They're close,' Jones said on 105.3 The Fan. 'It's so tragic when you think about that they were best friends. Josh was elated when Jerry came on the team because they were such good friends.

Struggle: Dallas Cowboys football player Josh Brent arrives at a memorial service for teammate Jerry Brown

Mourning: Brent, who was to arrive at the memorial with Brown's family, was allegedly drink driving when he crashed his car in the early hours of Saturday morning, killing Brown

'(Jackson) wanted to be right with 
Josh and to express in every way she could how much they loved him... 
and didnâ€™t want to have him grieve for his loss... without being 
included in their family.'

Brown was a passenger in Brent's car 
as he drove through Irving in the early hours of Saturday. The defensive
tackle was reportedly speeding when he hit a curb, flipping the car.

Irving police said that 25-year-old Brown - who also was Brent's teammate for three seasons at the 
University of Illinois - was found unresponsive at the scene and 
pronounced dead at a hospital.

His funeral is scheduled for Friday in St. Louis. Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said the team is not expected to attend.

After the crash, police officers conducted a field sobriety 
test on Brent and arrested him on suspicion of driving while 
intoxicated. The charge, which is 
punishable by two to 20 years in prison, was upgraded after Brown was 
pronounced dead.

He has since been released on $500,000 bond.

Cowboys coach Jason Garrett says the 
team would 'support Josh 100 percent in every way that we can'. A 
spokesman says the NFL has 'no issue' with Brent being at team 
facilities.

'I am devastated and filled with 
grief,' Brent said in a statement released Saturday to multiple media 
outlets by his agent Peter Schaffer.

'Filled with grief for the loss of my 
close friend and teammate, Jerry Brown. I am also grief-stricken for his
family, friends and all who were blessed enough to have known him.

'I will live with this horrific and 
tragic loss every day for the rest of my life. My prayers are with his 
family, our teammates and his friends at this time.'

Before the team's game on Sunday, the Bengals held a 
moment of silence before the national anthem. Most Cowboys bowed their 
heads, and Dallas quarterback Tony Romo and several other players had 
their hands over their hearts.

On
Fox's NFL Sunday show, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team had 
focused on Brown's death in the 'last few hours.' He didn't mention 
Brent.

'First of all we
all know, but we remind ourselves that there is something more 
important than football, and this is life, and certainly the lost life 
of Jerry,' Jones said on the TV show.

'On the other hand, they know the 
best way they can honor Jerry, because he was such a hard worker, so 
conscientious and enthusiastic about his career.'

It is not Brent's first brush with the law - or intoxication charge.

In February 2009, Brent was arrested 
in February 2009 near the Illinois campus for driving under the 
influence, driving on a suspended license and speeding, according to 
Champaign County, Illinois.

Sadness: Brent, who is charged with intoxication manslaughter, is out of jail on $500,000 bail

In June 2009, he pleaded guilty to
DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 
hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000.

As part of his 
plea deal, prosecutors dropped one count of aggravated DUI/no valid 
driver's license. Brent successfully completed his probation in July 
2011, court records show.

The Cowboys were preparing to fly to Cincinnati on Saturday for a Sunday game against the 
Bengals, when the team was told of the news, according to ESPN.

The players were told on the plane just 
before takeoff of what happened after non-team personnel were asked to 
go outside.

The Cowboys had signed Brown to their 
practice squad on October 24, but he hasn't been on the active roster. He was 
released from the Colts' practice squad on October 20. Brown played in one 
game for the Colts, a loss to the New York Jets on October 14.

His
death came a week after another NFL tragedy in which Kansas City Chiefs
player Jovan Belcher shot his girlfriend dead at their home before 
killing himself outside the team's stadium.
