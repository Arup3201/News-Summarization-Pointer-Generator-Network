Keen admirer: New Barcelona boss Luis Enrique tried to sign Koke at Roma, when he was a 19-year-old

The Spain international played an integral part in Atletico securing their first La Liga title since 1996 and he featured in all of Los Rojiblancos games on their run to the Champions League final against bitter rivals Real.

Sport state that new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is a huge admirer of the midfield maestro - who has often been compared to Xavi.

The publication adds that Enrique tried to sign the Spain international, when he was 19, during his stint as Roma boss in the 2011-12 season.

In an interview in March, Xavi hailed Koke as his successor in the national team.

'Koke is an extraordinary footballer,' Xavi was quoted as saying Atletico's club website.

'He has everything: talent, physical ability, he is a footballer of the present and the future.

'He has been marked out as the conductor of Spain's orchestra for the next 10 years.

'I have a special affection for him because we play in the same position and I think he is an extraordinary player,' he added.

Koke, who recorded the second-highest number of assists in La Liga last campaign with 14, has been heavily linked with United for over a year, as the Red Devils look to strengthen their midfield area.

Further reports in Spain state that the Old Trafford outfit are ready to meet his £48million release clause, as the deposed Premier League champions look to qualify for Europe next season under new boss Louis van Gaal.
