Jose Mourinho launched an attack on Arsene Wenger by claiming he would have been given a stadium ban if he had shoved the Arsenal manager.

Despite Wenger’s apology for his actions during Arsenal’s 2-0 defeat at Chelsea on October 5, Mourinho insists the FA give the Frenchman special treatment.

Wenger avoided disciplinary action after the high-profile incident at Stamford Bridge because it was dealt with at the time by referee Martin Atkinson.

Mourinho said: ‘I’m not surprised, I’m not surprised. (Me) charged? Charged? If it was me it would have been a stadium ban.’

Mourinho then revealed that he follows his own protocol before matches by shaking hands with opposition managers and insists it is not necessary at the final whistle. He said: ‘The moment I consider fundamental is to shake hands before the match, and before the match in my house, it’s my responsibility.

‘So I always go to the opponents’ dugout, or in the tunnel before the game . . . after the game, it depends on you, on the others.’

Wenger has apologised on French TV for the clash despite initially insisting he had 'nothing to regret'

Mourinho also responded to Aston Villa assistant Roy Keane who claimed a Sunday League boss would have knocked him out if he had attempted to shake hands with the opposition before the end of the game.

Mourinho said: ‘I don’t know if he really feels it, or if he wants to sell books and needs my help for that . . . but, to be fair, I know my nature, I know my intentions.’

He added sarcastically: ‘I appreciate the comments. I think they are both two great examples of polite and very well-educated people, and because I’m a humble guy who tries to learn every day and with every experience, I appreciate the comments.’

Mourinho has also found support from Sunderland manager Gus Poyet who accused Keane of betraying dressing-room secrets. ‘You can’t say one day that “What happens in the dressing room stays in the dressing room”, then write a book. I don’t like it,’ said Poyet.

Mourinho also found time to criticise the authorities over their fixture scheduling yet again after he was told Chelsea would play their Capital One Cup tie at Shrewsbury just 48 hours after their fixture at Manchester United on October 26.

He added: ‘Burn-out is to play Manchester United on the Sunday and Shrewsbury on the Tuesday. That’s burn-out.’
