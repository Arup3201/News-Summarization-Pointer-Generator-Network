A crazed gunman who terrorized three people during a standoff at a rural Louisiana bank posted terrifying Facebook messages including a cartoon about hostages in the hours leading up to his deadly assault.

The standoff ended after 12 hours on Tuesday with one male hostage shot dead by suspect
Fuaed Abdo Ahmed and another LaDean McDaniel being left in critically injured.

In the hours leading up to the deadly attack, it was discovered that Ahmed had posted a photo of a man with a sword battling a tank online.

Attack: Hostage-taker Fuaed Abdo Ahmed shot dead a bank employee and critically injured another in St Joseph, Louisiana on Tuesday. He was killed by a SWAT team who stormed the building

Disturbed: Ahmed posted this image on his Facebook in the hours leading up to the hostage situation at a Louisiana bank. He was killed along with one hostage

On August 11, he posted a cartoon strip on his Facebook wall which shows a hostage negotiation.

In the first image, a man in a balaclava pointing a gun at a man says: 'I'll release the hostage if you give me a sandwich!'

Two
 hostage negotiators are then seen discussing the demand. The first 
says: 'How close is the nearest deli' to which the other responds: 
'Three blocks.'

In the last picture, a hostage negotiator says through a bullhorn: 'Okay, you can kill the hostage.'

The 20-year-old had initially taken three hostages when he stormed the 
Tensas State Bank in St Joseph before releasing the woman.

Louisiana
 State Police superintendent Col. Mike Edmonson said he had no further 
information about the dead hostage.

Preparing for what comes: State and local authorities gathered outside the Tensas State Bank branch after an armed 20-year-old man took three people hostage Tuesday afternoon

Scene: The incident is believed to have started as a robbery attempt that escalated into a hostage situation

During
 negotiations with law enforcement Ahmed said he was going to kill the 
remaining two, and when officers entered the building just before 
midnight on Tuesday he shot the hostages before being shot and killed by 
police.

Edmonson said Ahmed shot the two hostages in the upper body before state police shot and killed him.

He said the hostages were taken from the scene in critical condition after the incident, which began when the gunman took two women and a man captive about 12:30 pm yesterday.

Hours after the standoff began, one of 
the hostages was released but their condition and identity has still not
 been made public.

Terrorizing: Ahmed was said to be delusional and had left behind notes and a hostage negotiation book at his apartment

Family: The suspected gunman with relatives in LA. He moved to Louisiana with family after his father died 12 years ago

In talks: The police stormed the bank at around midnight after talks with the hostage-taker failed

Edmonson confirmed the release of a female bank teller late Tuesday.

He said authorities were talking with her about her ordeal.

Earlier Tuesday, Edmonson said that 
the man had been calm and had made some demands, but he would not 
describe the demands or further identify the gunman.

'We're still working with him to determine exactly what his intent is,' Edmonson said.

The gunman, carrying at least a 
handgun, took two women and a man captive about 12:30 p.m. at the Tensas
 State Bank branch in St. Joseph, and a negotiator talked with him 
throughout the afternoon, said Trooper Albert Paxton, a state police 
spokesman.

The red-brick bank is just off 
Louisiana Highway 128, a rural stretch of road cutting through 
cornfields. It is across the street from Trak convenience store, which 
the gunman's family owns, in St. Joseph, the seat of Tensas Parish.

Edmonson had earlier warned that the standoff could last for some time.

'Our utmost concern right now more than anything else is the safety of those hostages,' he said.

More law enforcement people and equipment would be brought in, he said then. 'We've got to be prepared to act,' Edmonson said. 

Dangerous: Federal officers patrol the surrounding area of St. Joseph, Louisiana

The two hostages were released in what police described as a 'critical condition' before one of them died

The FBI, U.S. marshals, state police and local law enforcement officers were among those responding to the standoff.

Edmonson provided few details about 
the gunman, except to say he is originally from California and that his 
family settled in the Louisiana community and opened a convenience 
store.

He said some of the suspect's relatives tried to approach the scene earlier, and that authorities were now working with them.

Mayor Edward Brown said that, as a 
general rule, the town's most notable crimes are the occasional drug 
busts, and some residents are so frightened about what's happening that 
they've left town.

'It's a quiet town. Very little crime. So this is amazing,' Brown said.

The town of 1,200 is near the Mississippi River, downriver from Vicksburg, Miss., in northeast Louisiana.

Paxton said he believed that the Trak
 convenience store was evacuated, but there were few other occupied 
buildings within the perimeter that state police and the FBI set up.

Rural: Farm-worker Richardo Miles, 25, sits on his bike waiting for news of the hostages in the Tensas State Bank

Mobile command center: Officers from Louisiana State Police spent hours negotiating with the hostage-taker

Richardo Miles, a 25-year-old farmworker, said he lives about a half-mile from the bank.

He sat on his bicycle at a roadblock 
near an abandoned hardware store about a quarter-mile away, watching the
 activities of dozens of first responders, including paramedics and 
heavily armed men in camouflage.

A helicopter circled overhead in the 
overcast sky for a time as men, some carrying assault rifles, gathered 
in the street in front of the bank.

Law enforcement trucks also hauled in construction lights, apparently to prepare in case the standoff lasted into the night.

Late Tuesday, authorities had received a request for food from those inside the bank building.

The sight of the state police bomb squad and SWAT team unnerved many people in the sleepy farm town, Miles said.

'It's kind of startling for the 
residents. We're not accustomed to this kind of activity,' said Miles. 
'Some people are pretty scared. They're nervous.'

Tensas Parish lies along Mississippi 
River, but St. Joseph is about a mile from the riverbank and about two 
miles from a 3,000-acre oxbow lake that long ago was one of the river's 
bends. Nearly one-third of the parish's 5,000 residents live under the federal poverty level, according to U.S. Census figures.

Farmland makes up more than 45 
percent of the 600-square-mile parish, with most of it in cotton, feed 
grains, soybeans and wheat.
