Baroness Thatcher is to blame for the UK's adversarial relationship with Brussels and other European powers still cannot trust a British Prime Minister 23 years after she left office, one of her greatest political rivals said today.

Helmut Kohl, who was German Chancellor while the Iron Lady was in power, said their persistent rows meant they never had a good relationship.

While the 83-year-old praised Mrs Thatcher's bold attitude and honesty, he said today her European legacy is an antagonistic relationship on both sides of the Channel.

Strained: Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he never managed to have a good relationship with Baroness Thatcher and her attitude still causes problems for Britain

'It is true — Margaret Thatcher was difficult, just as our relationship was difficult,' Mr Kohl told The Times.

'Unlike with other leaders in Europe and the world, and despite the best efforts of both sides, Margaret and I simply never managed to build a trusting and warm relationship.

'[She] wanted Europe, but a different Europe from that wanted by most of her European colleagues and me. From our point of view, this antagonism characterises British policy on Europe to this day.

'But it is also true that Margaret Thatcher was an impressive personality, an admirable woman and a great Prime Minister of Britain.'

One of his successors, Angela Merkel, has been invited to Lady Thatcher's funeral next week, but is yet to accept.

It came as the Baroness's legacy was discussed in the Commons and Lords yesterday, where her attitude to Europe was widely praised.

Paying tribute to Britain's greatest post-war prime minister, David Cameron said: 'She was no starry-eyed internationalist, but again, her approach was rooted in simple, clear principles.

'Strength abroad begins with strength at home. Deterrence; not appeasement. The importance of national sovereignty – which is why she fought so passionately for Britain’s interests in Europe and always believed Britain should retain its own currency.

'Above all she believed to the core of her being that Britain stood for something in the world – for democracy, for the rule of law, for right over might'.

It was Lady Thatcher's determination to earn Britain an EU rebate that remains one of her greatest successes.

For four years, to the embarrassment of other officials, she would mention the need for a cash deal at every European meeting, until she got her way in 1984.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said: 'When it comes to money, the rebate she negotiated for this country from the EU has brought us so far £75 billion - which is twice the size of our annual defence budget.'
