Ronny Deila said an emotional farewell to former side Stromsgodset on Monday – and left the Norwegian club declaring that Celtic had snared their title-winning manager on the cheap.

Norway’s champions had demanded £1million in compensation for Deila. But sources close to ‘Godset reported that they’d eventually settled for £300,000 up front, rising to £500,000.

And sorting director Jostein Flo declared: ‘Ronny is worth 10 times more than Celtic paid. But there is no transfer market for managers, unfortunately.

‘When he wants to go, he has to go. That’s the same for all clubs. There is no reason to keep a manager when he wants to go.

‘For this club, it’s very important to build up players who then go out into the world. We’ve produced most of the players in Norway.

‘And now we feel like we’re doing the same with our manager. That’s important for us, although we were not trying to move him on.’

It was reported in Norway that Deila – paraded on the pitch at half-time during Monday’s 2-1 home win over FK Haugesund - had threatened to tear up his contract unless his club struck a deal with Celtic, who paraded their surprise appointment in Glasgow last Friday.

Asked if Celtic had been tough negotiators, Flo insisted: ‘I was not focused on that. It was important for us that Ronny had a chance at Celtic, so we let him go.

‘If not Celtic, another club of the same level would have come for him. A lot of big clubs were watching him. Bargain? I’m not talking about figures, I’m talking about people.

‘If it wasn’t Celtic, it was going to be another club in Europe. He was always going to be wanted by the biggest and best.

‘Ronny is good enough for nearly anything. He needs a good team around him – but he will build a good team around him.

‘Here, he’s brought in a lot of different types around him in order to develop players. That means teaching them more about how to eat, sleeping to preserve energy, fitness, mental strength – he will build all of that at Celtic.

‘The most important thing for Ronny is to win a football game, of course. But he knows that results only come if they develop all parts of the team. The way he builds players, he understands football.’

Team builder: Flo also tipped Deila to construct strong foundations at Celtic off the pitch as well as on it
