Argentina and Germany are preparing to fight it out in the 2014 World Cup final at the Maracana, but who are the players set to make history?

Here, Sportsmail's Rio Ferdinand delivers his verdict on each player with all the statistics you need.

Manuel Neuer, goalkeeper

Age: 28

Club: Bayern Munich

Caps/Goals: 51/0

Distance: 19.6miles

Top speed: 16.34mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 9

The best goalkeeper in the world. He is great with his feet, commanding in the air and is a very calming influence on the team. Very assured.

Ready: Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is preparing for the World Cup final 2014 on Sunday

Jerome Boateng, defender

Age: 25

Club: Bayern Munich

Caps/Goals: 45/0

Distance: 35.1miles

Top speed: 19.33mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5

Looked vulnerable earlier in the tournament but got better as it has gone on. Looks good alongside Hummels and has played the ball well out of defence.

Target: Jerome Boateng (left) chases the ball during Germany's 7-1 hammering of Brazil

Mats Hummels, defender

Age: 25

Club: Borussia Dortmund

Caps/Goals: 35/3

Distance: 26.5miles

Top speed: 20.1mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8

One of the best centre-backs of the tournament and now on the 10-man shortlist for FIFA’s Golden Ball award for the tournament’s best player.

Preparing: Mats Hummels is on FIFA's 10-man shortlist for the Golden Ball award (best player)

Benedikt Howedes, defender

Age: 26

Club: Schalke04

Caps/Goals: 27/2

Distance: 41.2miles

Top speed: 18.95mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7

I think he is the weakest of Germany’s back four, generally speaking, but in this tournament he’s done well and rarely gets exposed.

Flying high: Benedikt Howedes is arguably Germany's weakest defender but has done well so far

Philipp Lahm, defender

Age: 30

Club: Bayern Munich

Caps/Goals: 112/5

Distance: 41.8miles

Top speed: 17.83mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8

He was brilliant in the semi-final against Brazil — he’s quick and a tricky customer. He is classy, consistent, an all-round huge footballer.

Role: Philipp Lahm was brilliant in the semi-final against Brazil and is a tricky customer to handle

Bastian Schweinsteiger, midfielder

Age: 29

Club: Bayern Munich

Caps/Goals: 107/23

Distance: 29.7miles

Top speed: 18.14mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5

Has done simple things quite brilliantly and the defensive elements in his game have been great — I’ve never seen that side of his play before.

Looking out: Bastian Schweinsteiger has done the simple things brilliantly throughout the tournament

Sami Khedira, midfielder

Age: 27

Club: Real Madrid

Caps/Goals: 51/5

Distance: 29.4miles

Top speed: 18.52mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5

Another player who was fantastic in the 7-1 win against Brazil. Box-to-box midfielder has been one of Germany’s stand-out players.

Watch out: Sami Khedira (left) was fantastic in the 7-1 win over Brazil and can continue to keep his form

Toni Kroos, midfielder

Age: 24

Club: Bayern Munich

Caps/Goals: 50/7

Distance: 42.4miles

Top speed: 18.52mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5

A fantastic footballer — calm, calculated and assured. Has a real eye for goal and had more touches of the ball than any other player.

Fantastic: Toni Kroos is calm, calculated and assured, and has a real natural eye for goal

Mesut Ozil, midfielder

Age: 25

Club: Arsenal

Caps/Goals: 61/18

Distance: 36.7miles

Top speed: 19.9mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5

He’s been playing his part without really reaching the standards we’ve come to expect from him. He hasn’t done badly but his game hasn’t exploded.

Verdict: Mesut Ozil has been playing his part without really reaching the standards we expect of him

Thomas Muller, striker

Age: 24

Club: Bayern Munich

Caps/Goals: 55/22

Distance: 42.8miles

Top speed: 18.95mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 9

He’s had a great tournament. He’s so important to this team. His work-rate is top class and his scoring ability is invaluable, as are his many assists.

Talent: Thomas Muller has had a great tournament and has been important to his team throughout

Miroslav Klose, striker

Age: 36

Club: Lazio

Caps/Goals: 136/71

Distance: 13.4miles

Top speed: 18mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8

The record World Cup goalscorer, what more can you say? Scoring goals is the point of football — and he’s the best. An excellent finisher.

History: The record World Cup goalscorer, what more can you say about Miroslav Klose?

GERMANY TOTAL: 89.5 OUT OF 110

Lionel Messi, striker

Age: 27

Club: Barcelona

Caps/Goals: 92/42

Distance:32.3miles

Top speed: 18.39mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8

Hasn’t performed as well as he can but there have still been magic moments along the way. We haven’t seen the best of him, perhaps we will on Sunday.

The main man: Lionel Messi has led Argentina even though we haven't seen his best... yet

Sergio Romero, goalkeeper

Age: 27

Club: Monaco

Caps/Goals: 53/0

Distance: 12.6miles

Top speed: 15.1mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8

The shoot-out hero against Holland. He’s had a decent tournament but on Sunday will be a big test — Argentina need him to be right on his game.

Stopper: Sergio Romero was the shoot-out hero against Holland and will hope to be the main man again

Pablo Zabaleta, defender

Age: 29

Club: Man City

Caps/Goals: 42/0

Distance: 40.76miles

Top speed: 18.39mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5

More defensive responsibility for his country than when he’s in a Manchester City shirt but he has been solid for Argentina and has had a solid tournament.

Emotional: Pablo Zabaleta has been given more defensive responsibility for Argentina than at Manchester City

Martin Demichelis, defender

Age: 33

Club: Man City

Caps/Goals: 40/2

Distance: 12.6miles

Top speed: 16.22mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5

He is not everyone’s cup of tea but he has done OK. He certainly hasn’t been left exposed and he has read the game well. A solid performance.

Passion: Martin Demichelis isn't everyone's cup of tea but has done good enough for Argentina so far

Ezequiel Garay, defender

Age: 27

Club: Benfica

Caps/Goals:24/0

Distance:39.5miles

Top speed: 19.51mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8

I think that he has been the best player in the Argentinian back four. He has a raw, commanding presence and makes a big difference.

Challenge: Ezequiel Garay has arguably been Argentina's best player in the back four during the World Cup

Marcos Rojo, defender

Age: 24

Club: Sporting CP

Caps/Goals: 27/1

Distance: 36.4miles

Top speed: 19.76mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5

I like him because he is eager to attack the opposition, he is young, athletic and looks like he could be good player for the future.

Roar: Marcos Rojo is eager to attack the opposition and is young, athletic and has plenty of potential

Angel Di Maria, midfielder

Age: 26

Club: Real Madrid

Caps/Goals: 52/10

Distance: 28.5miles

Top speed: 20.51mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8

He can carry the ball, score goals and beat a player in the middle of the pitch. A huge asset for any team and, if his injury holds out, will be a key man.

Key: Angel Di Maria can carry the ball, score goals and beat a player in the centre of the pitch

Lucas Biglia, midfielder

Age: 28

Club: Lazio

Caps/Goals: 25/0

Top speed: 18.6miles

Top speed: 17.03mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7

He is athletic, works hard in the Argentinian midfield and has a real eye for a pass.

Hard worker: Lucas Biglia knows how to keep his eyes open for a pass to cut open the opposition

Javier Mascherano, midfielder

Age: 30

Club: Barcelona

Caps/Goals: 104/3

Distance: 41.8miles

Top speed: 18.83mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 8.5

Arguably the best player on the pitch for Argentina on Sunday. He’s disciplined, retains possession, offers great security for the centre-backs A solid player.

Hug: Javier Mascherano is arguably the best player on the pitch for Argentina and gives his all

Ezequiel Lavezzi, midfielder

Age: 29

Club: Paris St-Germain

Caps/Goals: 36/4

Distance: 23.7miles

Top speed: 19.64mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7

I feel he’s got more to give in terms of goals and assists. He hasn’t replicated the skills he has shown at club level. There’s more to come from him.

Verdict: Ezequiel Lavezzi can give more in terms of goals and assists for the Argentina team

Gonzalo Higuain, striker

Age: 26

Club: Napoli

Caps/Goals: 42/21

Distance: 34miles

Top speed: 20.57mph

RIO’S VERDICT: 7.5

He’s an out and out goalscorer. You give him a chance and he’ll punish you. Argentina need him up and at the Germans if they are to have a chance.

Energy: Gonzalo Higuain need sto be up and at the Germans if Argentina are to have a chance

ARGENTINA TOTAL: 84.5 OUT OF 110
