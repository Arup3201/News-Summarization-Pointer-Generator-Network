Their normal mode of royal transport is a Bentley

But Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were game for a laugh today as they took a ride on a tuk tuk round the gardens of Clarence House.

The couple were lending their support to a charity rickshaw race that will take place later this in memory of Camilla's late brother, Mark Shand.

The Travels To My Elephant trek will see participants, including model Yasmin Le Bon and her daughter, Amber, drive 500 kilometres across India to highlight the plight of the endangered Asian Elephant.

The royal couple viewed two in a fleet of motorised rickshaws that have been decorated by fashion designers and artists, including DVF and Nicky Haslam, which will also be auctioned off for the cause.

Much to the surprise of the waiting photographers, the future king and his wife duly jumped in one of the creations for a spin round their garden.

Unfortunately for the royal passengers their driver, Camilla's nephew Ben Elliott, managed to stall the vehicle several times, sending the couple lurching forward and Charles to jokingly wag his finger.

The event is called 'Travels to my Elephant' and is inspired by Elephant Family's late founder, Mark Shand, Camilla's brother, who passed away in April 2014

Here they come! The couple looked quite at home taking the quirky form of transport

Eventually, he managed to get it started and whizzed off with the couple, both weeping with laughter, in the back.

'They aren't easy to drive those things,' businessman Mr Elliot, 39, later laughed.

'Fortunately I have got broad shoulders and so have they.'

Earlier Camilla had been in tears as speakers, including her own husband, lined up to pay tribute to her late brother.

Mark tragically died in a freak accident at the age of just 62 last April, after tripping over on a pavement in New York and suffering a catastrophic head injury.

The adventurer was in the US to raise funds for his charity, Elephant Family, a cause that had dominated his colourful life since he rescued an Asian elephant, Tara, as a young man.

The rickshaw fleet will be decorated in London by a spectrum of artists, milliners and fashion houses including DVF, Nicky Haslam, Piers Atkinson and Gordon Murray

They're more accustomed to being chauffeured in Range Rovers and Rolls Royces, but The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall enjoyed a somewhat less conventional form of public transport

His travels with the pachyderm were recorded in his best-selling book ‘Travels on my Elephant.’

The grieving Duchess and her husband became Joint Presidents of Elephant Family after his death.

In a short but affectionate speech Charles said yesterday; ‘I just want to say that when this terrible tragedy occurred last year and we lost Mark, my wife and I decided that we must keep his legacy going. ‘

He described his late brother-in-law as being an ‘inspirational’ man whose work creating elephant ‘corridors’ in Asia were of ’enormous importance’ in allowing man and beast to live alongside each other.

In all a fleet of thirty rickshaws will journey 500 kilometres across Madhya Pradesh, India, in a race to save Asia’s elephants from extinction.

Mark Shand was brother to The Duchess of Cornwall and dedicated his life to saving Asia’s elephants.

Someone enjoyed themselves! Prince Charles proved he was game for a laugh at today's event

Among the participants is supermodel Yasmin Le Bon and her daughter, Amber, also a model.

She told Mail Online: ‘Mark was a dear friend whose work was so important. It would be a crime not to carry it on.

‘I’m very into my cars but racing a rickshaw is going to be something else.

‘I am going to be the driver and Amber will be the navigator. We get on brilliantly but I think being cooped up in a rickshaw for eight days together it going to be explosive.

‘Luckily the engine is loud so I won’t be able to hear her – although I might be tempted to take some gaffer tape too.

‘I really want people to support us in any way they can. It is the mad sort of challenge Mark would thoroughly have approved of and its wonderful for the prince and duchess to lend their support.’

Since its launch in 2002, the charity has invested over £6m in conservation projects across Asia, working to secure elephant and wildlife habitats

Elephant Family is the UK’s biggest funder of the endangered Asian elephant, of which there are believed to be just 35,000-40,000 in the wild.

Since its launch in 2002, the charity has invested over £6m in conservation projects across Asia, working to secure elephant and wildlife habitats, supporting local communities to reduce incidents of human-elephant conflict and highlighting the plight of the Asian elephant with UK-wide education programs and publicity.

Founded in 2002, Elephant Family takes a creative approach to conservation and is best known for Elephant Parade London which saw 258 brightly painted elephant sculptures installed throughout London.  

Prince Charles enjoyed a first glimpse of the decorated rickshaws with model mother and daughter duo, Amber and Yasmin Le Bon

Guests at the launch on Thursday include Mr Shand's former girlfriend Ruth Powys - the organisation's CEO - models Amber and Yasmin le Bon, pictured with Prince Charles, and actress Joanna Lumley

The trek is being launched with the help of the Quintessentially Foundation, run by Camilla’s newphew, Ben Elliot, who is also taking part.
