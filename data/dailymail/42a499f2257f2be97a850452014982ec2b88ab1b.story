Richey Kiffe, 52, who is accused of strangling four of his ex-girlfriend's Chihuahua puppies and beheading one of them 

A man has been accused of strangling four of his ex-girlfriend's Chihuahua puppies before beheading her favourite pet and leaving it on the doorstep in a drunken attack.

Richey Kiffe, 52, from Louisiana allegedly killed the pets and stuffed their corpses into a bag before hiding them behind the sofa.

He also left the body and head of the beheaded dog on the door step of his home in Houma so it would greet his former partner Suzanna Guthrie, when she went to his house.

Kiffe has now been charged with four counts of aggravated cruelty to animals

Police were called to the property on Tuesday and is being held in the Terrebonne Parish jail on a $50,000 bond.

Police officers were called to Kiffe's house on Tuesday evening after Ms Guthrie found the bodies of her pets.

According to Houma Today, she had asked him to care for her two dogs and the puppies after breaking up with him two weeks ago.

He then asked her to go to his house to pick up the dogs after talking over how they were going to split their possessions.

She told the newspaper: 'He asked me "What do you want me to do with your stuff?" 

I told him: 'My name is on that lease; I'm not going nowhere, but could you pick up my dogs please?"

'And the next thing that comes out of his mouth is: "I can't be responsible for what happens next."'

'The one that I found was the one I had named, the one he knew I wanted.'

Neighbours on the street where Kiffe lived in Houma, pictured, spoke of their shock after seeing the bodies of the dead dogs 

Neighbours living near to the couple also told of their shock of seeing the body of the beheaded dog.

One neighbour, only known as Jim, told WGNO: 'The head, it was clean cut, washed, everything. That`s what starts off serial killers.'

If convicted with animal cruelty, Kiffe faces up to a $25,000 fine and 10 years in prison.
