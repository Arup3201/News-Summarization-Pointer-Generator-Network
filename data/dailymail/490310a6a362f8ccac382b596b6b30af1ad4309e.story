When Beth Garvey and boyfriend Alex Troth went to see Dippy the dinosaur at the Natural History Museum they decided the perfect way to enjoy the experience would be to dress up as animals themselves.

The teenage couple from Swindon in Wiltshire donned dinosaur and Pokemon onesies for the visit to the London museum. 

But they were soon deterred from making an exhibition of themselves and were told they would have to change before they were allowed in.

Staff told Miss Garvey, 17 and Mr Troth, 18, to remove the costumes as they made their way into the museum because they visitors in fancy dress had caused problems in the past.

The pair were forced to remove their onesies and store them in bags, which staff then insisted on searching to check nothing was concealed inside the outfits.

'We got pulled aside in front of everyone first, then they told us we had to take them off,' Miss Garvey said.

'Luckily we had clothes on underneath but a lot of people don't.

'They said it was classed as a costume and we couldn't wear that in the museum. We said, no it was pyjamas, you sell them yourselves.

'They were insistent it was a costume and asked if we were celebrating someone's birthday which was why we were wearing them. I was gobsmacked.'

Both said they decided to wear onesies - Miss Garvey wearing a onesie depicting Pokemon character Umbreon-  for the college trip after they were told to wear something comfortable.  

The teenage couple had planned to visit the museum's famous Dippy the dinosaur exhibit in the Central Hall

Both claimed they had worn the costumes for comfort and did not understand why they were asked to change

They travelled to London, by train, without any questions and made their way to the museum, in South Kensington, in December.

Miss Garvey said she also found having to have their bags searched in front of everyone humiliating. 

The pair's onesies were later stored behind a desk 

She added: 'They made us stand there, in front of everyone, we felt like we have done something really, really wrong.

'Then they took our onesies from us and put them behind the desk, giving us this ticket we could use to collect them when we were done at the museum at the end of the day.

'All for an item of clothing which they sell in their own shop.

'It was very strange, they didn't have any signs, I checked the website when I got back to see if I'd missed something.

'There was nothing about any other forms of clothing on, it just said you could take anything as long as it was not threatening.'

A spokesman for the museum said there was no particular dress code for entry to the museum, but the duty manager has responsibility for deciding who is allowed inside. 

He said: 'We have in the past had visitors in costumes cause disturbances in the building, which affected other people's experience at the museum.

'After their onesies were put in the cloakroom Ms Garvey and her partner continued their visit and we offered complimentary tickets in recompense for the inconvenience and embarrassment they felt.'
