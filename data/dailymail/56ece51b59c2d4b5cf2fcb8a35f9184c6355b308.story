The stars consider Matt Roberts the crème de la crème of fitness trainers.

His high profile clients include those of the fashion world (Naomi Campbell, Tom Ford and John Galliano), singers (Natalie Imbruglia) and stars of the small screen (Amanda Holden), not to mention an unnamed royal.

He has even helped to shape up the country's political minds with David Cameron (and his wife Samantha) being loyal clients. 

Celebrity trainer - Matt Roberts - has launched a new affordable gym range for Argos

While not everyone may be able to afford access to Matt's personal expertise, he believes that's no excuse not to get fit.

He has extended his at-home gym range at Argos - having already sold over 109,000 products in the first year of trading - so people can gain fitness equipment they can use at home at affordable prices, starting at £7.99 for a skipping rope.

The range is the latest addition in his fitness empire which includes five of his own gyms, a store in London's Mayfair, several fitness retreats and a collection of supplements.

The lower prices are reflective of 
Matt's objective behind the launch - to make fitness available to all - as
 he said he is tired of hearing people's excuses on why they don't 
exercise. Whether that's being too poor, too busy or just too lazy.

He told the Express that you have no one to blame but yourself if you are unhappy with your fitness.

'Well if you don't exercise congratulations on losing seven years of your life. There isn't a choice and there are no excuses. You are decreasing the quality of your life.

'You need to make time. It takes 15 to 20 minutes of vigorous work, three to four days a week. That is enough.'

For Matt no excuses mean no excuses, as he even claims that new mothers should make time to exercise.

Other clients of Matt have included comedian Michael McIntyre

'Exercise whenever and wherever you 
can - for short bursts of time - is fantastic for your metabolism. Many 
of my clients are busy mums and they only have 15 minutes to spare, 
which is enough to get results,' says Matt, who famously got Sam Cam 
back into shape after the birth of her daughter, Florence.

He says that exercising can easily be incorporated into any daily routine; you just have to be inventive.

'Briskly pushing a pram, doing a ten to 15-minute set of lunges, squats and tricep dips while you're running a bath, or a short, fast sprint on a spin bike will get results, so don't think you have to spend hours exercising to lose weight.'

For Matt the body young girls should be aspiring towards is Jennifer Lawrence

His new gym range includes everything from the classic dumbbell to a very swish treadmill with bluetooth. However, Matt is insistent that the simplest of equipment - like a skipping rope - can be all it takes to get to start getting fit.

Matt may have trained some rather impressive British stars but when it comes to a fitness role model, he believes Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence makes a great idol for young women.

'She’s a great advert for females,' he told the Express. 'She’s not your traditional, pencil-thin Hollywood actress. She's got curves but she's not overweight. She's in great shape.'

He added that we shouldn't be deterred by celebrities and that their body shapes aren't unattainable.

'All bodies are just bodies. They all go through the same process. What makes someone a celebrity is not just the body, it's the person. You can achieve the same as they can. You have to focus on what you can become, what you want to become and take great pride in that.'

Argos Buyer, Chris Billingham, said: 'The products are a great addition and a natural evolution of the range given the success we have seen. Introducing technology into the products also feeds customers desire for data and a more interactive user experience.

'It’s fantastic, on the treadmill one day you could be running around the streets of San Francisco and the next running around the Colosseum in Rome. Education is important and Matt's been fantastic to work with throughout landing the project and is really helping to aid the customers into how they can get the best out of their equipment.'
