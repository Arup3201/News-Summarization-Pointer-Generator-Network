For the first time ever, two high school students from Florida with Down syndrome were crowned homecoming king and queen.

Travjuan Hunter, who goes by Bubba, and his queen Semone Adkins stood in a football field on October 11th in front of all their peers who cheered them on as they were adorned with crowns and handed bouquets of flowers.

Bubba proudly wore a black tuxedo and Semone stunned in a floor length sparkly gray dress.

The two lucky students were among 12 students at West Orange High in Central Florida competing for the title of homecoming king and queen.

Overjoyed: Semone (left) and Bubba (right) were elated on October 11 when they were voted out of 12 other contestants as the winners of homecoming king and queen at their Florida high school 

'I am so excited, I am so proud of my son,' said Janice Morgan, Bubba's mom to Click Orlando.

Morgan added that Semone and Bubba have been lifelong friends and that sharing this moment is truly heart-warming.

'It was a dream come true, because I always knew that she was going to be something great in this world and this is just the beginning for us,' said Karen McNeil, Semone's mom.

Today.com reports that both Bubba and Semone were elected separately which means one of them could have won without the other. They won together and they earned it.

With 3,800 students at the largest high school in the county voting for them each individually, there's no question that they made a glowing impression among their peers.

'It was something that I can't explain. When they chose Bubba and Semone for the homecoming king and queen, I feel that those kids really proved that they are just like everyone else, and they can do anything any other person can do,' said McNeil.

Semone told Today.com that she almost chose to have an abortion when she found out her daughter had Down syndrome when she was already seven months pregnant.

She's glad the doctor wouldn't allow her to end her difficult pregnancy. 

Her child before Semone died at just 3-years-old from neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer.

McNeil almost lost her own life while giving birth to her beloved daughter Simone.

'When she came out, I was scared to look at her,' McNeil said.

'I wasn't educated about Down syndrome, but then I heard the doctor say, "She is beautiful."'

Proud parent:  Bubba's mother said she is proud of her son and of his accomplishments and added that he has come a long way after being born prematurely with a small chance of surviving 

Always had faith: Semone's mom says she always knew her daughter would do something great someday despite originally wanting to have an abortion when she found out her daughter had Down Syndrome 

'From that point on, I started hemorrhaging and almost died, but I promised God that if he let me live, I would love her and take care of her forever. When I said that, that's when my blood pressure started coming back up.'

When Bubba was born prematurely after 23 weeks he weighed less than three pounds.

He was kept in a neonatal intensive care unit for nearly two months before he could go home with his family.

The king and queen of West Orange High stunned their parents and their peer’s days before the election at the school's talent show as well.

Semone danced to Beyonce's hit Single Ladies and then in a romantic finale, Bubba walked out  on stage and put a ring on Semone's finger to Beyonce's singing 'put a ring on it.'

The crowd cheered wildly when Bubba then ripped open his shirt to reveal a superman outfit.

'The student body has just embraced them, and all of this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the admiration and respect from the student body,’’ teacher Jim Mattingly, who specializes in working with students with intellectual disabilities.

'It's just been absolutely breath-taking to watch.'

Mattingly also went on to tell Today just how popular Bubba is with students at the school.

'The audience went crazy,’' Mattingly said.

'Bubba is just such a popular young man, just so friendly, that everybody just enjoys him, and it doesn’t take long for him to make friends. Semone is a little more reserved, but when she went up on stage in that talent show, she just came alive. She put on a great performance. It was just very inspirational.'

Semone's mom said that she was so happy after the event and was so pleased with all the coverage it got that she gets excited every time she sees a news van.

“I felt like (the students) accepted her for who she is,' McNeil said about her daughter.

'When she won homecoming queen, I was just really happy that she is here. She’s still so excited from all the coverage that whenever she sees a news van, she jumps up and starts waving. It’s just a time that I’ll never forget.'
