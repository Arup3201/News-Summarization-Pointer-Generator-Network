Rocker Courtney Love has revealed that she's ditched her signature grunge look because she feels she's 'simply too old' to pull it off.

In a personal essay for Style.com/Print magazine, released this week, the 49-year-old says nowadays she prefers wearing classic designs by Calvin Klein, Michael Kors and Oscar de la Renta.

She has also stopped wearing the 'brilliant' clothes from her own fashion label, Never the Bride, as the flapper and baby-doll style cuts.no longer suit her mature guise.

Feeling in a reflective mood, the blonde mother-of-one looks back at how she became an accidental fashion icon.

'When I was younger and full of piss and vinegar and starting my band, I just wore what I wore.

'There was no contrivance  . . . it was what I found and was my look.

'It
 was utilitarian, I could pack fast, and I was extremely, extremely 
picky about the dresses and shoes and little plastic tiaras and 
barrettes I wore.'

She says that she would scour vintage stores for 'crepe' and 'collar-cuff' dresses.

'I was on the prowl constantly for 
collar-cuff dresses . . . or, as the goths now like to call it, "the 
Wednesday Addams dress."'

'I could not afford a beauty parlor, so my hair was constantly candyfloss platinum with a brown streak'

'They were velvet generally, but sometimes they
 were WWII rayon and looked as though Carole Lombard might have worn 
it.'

On the beauty front, she said her disheveled look was the result of little time and lack of money.

'I didn't have time to use a primer on my
 skin, so my makeup ran.

'I could not afford a beauty parlor, so my hair 
was constantly candyfloss platinum with a brown streak.'

Music star: Ms Love rose to prominence as the lead vocalist and guitarist of alternative band Hole, which she formed in 1989 - here she is seen performing at Glastonbury festival in 1999

Priding herself on being a trendsetter, Ms Love accuses today's musicians of being 'contrived' and 'artless'.

'Mostly everything is contrived now. Miley Cyrus is not setting any trends.

'Mostly everything is contrived now. Miley Cyrus is not setting any trends - if you can't start a trend, you're screwed'

'I wonder who decided to put her in white mesh and a pair of pasties and
 a faux fur? It was dumb and trashy-looking.

'Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry . . . It's artless pop
 at the end of the day, and, yeah, I have listened to "Roar" and "We 
Can't Stop" and I love "Wrecking Ball" for a guilty pleasure, but these 
are songs written by men mostly for pop tarts.

'If you can't start a trend, you're screwed.'

Ms Love, was born in San Francisco, California, and spent a troubled upbringing in and out of foster homes and juvenile detention centers before being legally emancipated at age 16.

Multi-talented: In addition to music, Ms Love had an intermittent acting career - here she is in a scene from the 1996 film The People vs. Larry Flynt, which earned her a Golden Globe nomination

Former husband: Ms Love pictured with the late Kurt Cobain at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards in Los Angeles - they had one daughter together, Frances Bean, six months after getting married

She moved to Portland, Oregon, and supported herself by working as an stripper, a DJ, and at a costumier.

She
 eventually found an outlet for her 'anger' in rock 'n roll and rose to 
prominence as the lead vocalist and guitarist of alternative band Hole, 
which she formed in 1989.

One to read: Ms Love's essay is included in the spring 2014 issue of Style.com/Print magazine

Her
 unpredictable stage presence and confrontational lyrics made her a 
fixture in alternative music media during the Nineties and her personal life 
and battles with drug addiction have been widely publicized.

She
 married Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in 1992 and they had a
 daughter, Frances Bean, six months later. In April 1994, Cobain 
committed suicide in their Seattle home while Ms Love was in rehab in Los 
Angeles.

In addition to
 music, Ms Love had an intermittent acting career, starring in Alex Cox's 
cult films Sid and Nancy (1986) and Straight to Hell (1987), and later 
returning to acting with a lead role in MiloÅ¡ Forman's The People vs. 
Larry Flynt (1996), which earned her a Golden Globe nomination for her 
portrayal of Althea Flynt.

In her new essay, she reveals that she is set to star in two films over the coming months.

'These
 are penance parts, theyâ€™re good films and good roles, but they are also
 to show the community that I show up and donâ€™t take drugs.'

Meanwhile her next album, tentatively titled Died Blonde, is set for release on December 2013, with a possible tour to follow. In addition to this, Ms Love aims to release an autobiography.
