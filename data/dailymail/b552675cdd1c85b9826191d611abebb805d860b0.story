Jasmine Waltz is the second housemate to leave the Celebrity Big Brother house.

The American model and actress, 31, didn't appear too bothered, despite being separated from love interest Lee Ryan.

In a further twist, she was also given the power to save two housemates from eviction on Friday night, so surprisingly chose Linda Nolan and Casey Batchelor.

She explained: 'I just stopped caring. I was protecting her... but after she did that, I just lost interest in trying to protect her when she's out to get me.'

Despite having seen footage of Lee and Casey kissing, she wasn't too sympathetic to the glamour model: 'She lied and wanted me out of the house.'

When asked about her future with Lee: 'I don't really know. I can't really predict. I'm sure we'll see each other when we get out.'

However, she wasn't sure if anything would happen between Lee and Casey now she had departed: 'I wouldn't put it past Lee (to try it on with Casey again).'
