Equatorial Guinea will replace Morocco as hosts of the Africa Cup of Nations.

Morocco will not host the 2015 tournament because of its fears over the Ebola outbreak elsewhere on the continent, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) confirmed.

As a result CAF expelled Morocco, who would have qualified as hosts, from the finals.

Equatorial Guinea have replaced Morocco as hosts of 2015 African Cup of Nations starting on January 17

Confederation of African Football (CAF) president Issa Hayatou decided to expel Morocco from the tournament

It is an oil-rich nation which became independent from Spain in 1968

Main language is Spanish and religion Roman Catholic

It is made up of a mainland territory called Rio Muni, and five islands including Bioko, where the capital Malabo is.

One of Africa's smallest countries, pop: 622,000

Fang is the most predominant ethnic group - nearly 86% of the population

Its currency is the Central African Franc

It has a tropical climate - it will be the dry season in Bioko but wet in Rio Muni

Co-hosted the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations with Gabon

Capital Malabo is one of four venues along with Bata, Ebebiyin, Mongomo. 

Three nations expressed an interest to host the tournament due to take place from January 17 to February 8.

Equatorial Guinea were also thrown out of the tournament in July for fielding an ineligible player during the qualifying process, but will now be reinstated as hosts.

The man who organised the 2008 event in Ghana has already expressed fears that starting the cup on time will be impossible. Dr Kofi Amoah said: 'It could be a sham. I don't think there is enough time for anyone to do it.'

CAF President Issa Hayatou insists: 'The 2015 Africa Cup of Nations must absolutely take place from January 17th to February 8th.'

Egypt stated it would not host the tournament for 'economic and political reasons', while 2013 and 2008 hosts South Africa and Ghana also ruled themselves out of contention.

Qualification matches for the tournament will continue as planned on Friday and Saturday to decide which 15 teams will join the new host country for the finals.

Morocco had expressed fears an influx of foreign fans could help spread the Ebola epidemic.

The North African country is scheduled to host Fifa's Club World Cup next month, featuring Champions League winners Real Madrid.

It said it was willing to continue with its hosting duties for that tournament because it did not expect many supporters to travel from Ebola-affected regions.

The two African teams playing in the Club World Cup are from Morocco and Algeria.
