A sick thug who killed a Big Issue seller for kicks has been released from his custodial sentence after just two years and has taken to Facebook to tell of his ‘boredom’.

Warren Crago was 16 when he and two teenage friends beat homeless man Ralph Millward, 41, to death after finding him asleep on a pavement in Westbourne, Bournemouth.

Although a judge described the brutal attack as the 'worst case of mob violence imaginable', Crago and accomplice Craig Real were jailed for four years.

But after serving half of their sentence they are now back on the streets.

Crago, now 18, has gone on Facebook to write about being bored after getting out of ‘pen’. He is even using his police mugshot photo as his profile picture.

He wrote: 'Jus got out pen and thikin bout goin bk i am bored nuthin to do out in the big world for me.'

Real used the social networking site to have a vile rant at the police for trying to ‘send me down for murder’ as well as threatening to punch ‘black boys’.

Mr Millward’s grieving father Ken, 78, said he was sickened by the teenagers’ conduct.

He said: 'I would have hanged them. I have always believed in life for a life.

'I profess to be a Christian, I go to church, but for me I can never forgive them.'

A female friend of Mr Millward, who didn’t want to be named, added: 'These thugs have evidently not learned their lesson from being in prison and are taking no responsibility.'

Accomplice: Jimmy Ayres was convicted of the attack alongside Crago.

Real, Crago and 15-year-old Jimmy Ayres, all from the Rossmore estate in Poole, Dorset, had spent the night of May 6, 2009 drinking cider and vodka.

At 2am, they went out to get some cigarettes and found Mr Millward in his sleeping bag at his regular pitch in Westbourne, Bournemouth.

They woke him up, but he refused to hand over his cigarettes, prompting the savage attack.

The victim suffered 10 broken ribs, a 
ruptured spleen and bleeding on the brain. His injuries were said to 
have been consistent with being involved in a car crash.

The yobs were caught on CCTV re-enacting the attack, making punching and stamping motions as they walked up the road.

Mr Millward’s body was discovered a few hours later by an outreach worker who went to check up on him.

The teenage trio were found guilty of manslaughter at Winchester Crown Court last year.

Judge Guy Boney QC said: 'You carried out this attack for no better reason than you were bored and looking for excitement.'

Real, a dad of one, was jailed for four years and nine months, Crago for four years and Ayres for 90 weeks.

After being released, Real wrote on Facebook about how he had been stopped by the police, prompting an online rant.

He wrote: 'I hate the old bill never b polite to them after trying to send me down for murder.'

He also wrote vile racist remarks about black people.

He added: 'I’m not ona bout anyone else its just the black boys I’ve had a life time off them inside and they won’t be kissing there teeth when I’m out aswell cause ill knock there teeth out next time.'
