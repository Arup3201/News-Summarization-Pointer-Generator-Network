Bungling Highway Patrol troopers mistakenly accused an elderly driver of stealing his own car after misreading his number plate.

Sobbing, Robin Bruins had three guns pointed at him and was ordered to remove his shirt, before being handcuffed and hauled off to jail.

He was driving his classic 1962 Chevy Impala in Las Vegas with his wife, Beverly, in the passenger seat when he was pulled over as part of a routine check.

But the hapless Highway Patrol trooper misread the registration number leading to the vehicle showing up as using a plate belonging to an expired Harley Davidson.

Robin and Beverley Bruins have filed a lawsuit against the troopers involved and Nevada Highway Patrol

A further error by a dispatcher, who misheard the classic car's VIN number, led to the vehicle wrongly being identified as stolen from California.

'I turned and looked back and saw three gun barrels pointed at me,' Mr Bruins from Washington told KLAS.

'And, obviously it hit me. Whoa! What's going on here. To this day I have never experienced anything like looking down the barrel of guns like that.'

The whole incident was recorded by the dashboard camera on the Highways officers.

In the footage the armed officers can be heard shouting over one another as they fire multiple commands at a bemused Mr Bruins.

At one point the confused senior citizen asked: 'Are you talking to me?'

Troopers barked multiple instructions at the confused senior citizen after pulling him over

As Mr Bruins started to take his shirt off a male officer barked: 'With the top of your collar'

After being instructed to remove his shirt a male officer can be heard to bark: 'With the top of your collar.'  

Once Mr Bruins was handcuffed  officer's ordered his wife, who was on crutches after breaking her leg, out of the vehicle.

As she went to reach for the sticks she was told to keep her hands in the air where the patrolmen could see them.

She was then taken to see her tearful husband in the back of the patrol car and told to say her goodbyes. 

Mr Bruins was handcuffed before being hauled off to jail where he spent a night in the cells

Troopers barked at Mrs Bruin, who had a broken leg, to put her crutches down as she was also ordered out of the vehicle

'I said ''goodbye to my husband, where is he going?'' she told KLAS.

'She said, ''he will be going to jail.''

Mr Bruins was taken to Clark County Detention Centre where he spent a night in the cells.

'Why should this have happened to anybody?' Mrs Bruins told KLAS.

The couple have now filed a lawsuit against the troopers and the Nevada Highway Patrol after the charges were dismissed.
