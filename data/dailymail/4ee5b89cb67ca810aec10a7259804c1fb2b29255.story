More than 150,000 cars are being recalled in the UK due to safety fears over the passenger-side airbag, it emerged today.

The problem, which affects Toyota, Honda and Nissan models, relates to the airbag inflator, which may burst and send pieces of plastic flying.

There have been five incidents - in the USA and Japan - but no injuries.

Worldwide, the three companies are recalling more than two million vehicles.

Safety alert: Toyota is recalling thousands of cars in the UK, including the Corolla model from 2001 (above) due to a problem with the passenger-side airbag

Toyota is recalling 76,000 vehicles 
bought in the UK in the period November 2000 to March 2004, while Honda 
is recalling 15,400 UK-bought vehicles made between 2001 and 2004.

Nissan said that 59,058 of its cars 
sold in the UK are affected by the recall, including the X-Trail, 
Patrol, Almera, and Navara models.

The recall also involves 1,913 of the Mazda 6 models bought in the UK in 2002-03.

Nissan is also recalling some vehicles manufactured between 2000 and 2004 in the UK.

The Toyota recall involves models such
as the Corolla and the Yaris, while the Honda recall involves the 
Civic, the CRV and the FRV.

The recall for air bags made by 
Japan's Takata Corp affects other automakers, including non-Japanese 
manufacturers, Takata spokesman Akiko Watanabe said today, but she declined to give details.

Fears: Honda is recalling 15,400 UK-bought vehicles made between 2001 and 2004, including the Civic

Toyota Motor Corp is recalling 1.7 
million vehicles with some 580,000 in North America, 490,000 in Europe 
and 320,000 in Japan. Affected models include the Corolla, Tundra, Lexus
SC, produced between November 2000, and March 2004.

Honda Motor Co. is recalling 1.1 
million vehicles. About 680,000 are in North America, 270,000 in Japan 
and 64,000 in Europe. The models include Civic and Odyssey.

Toyota has been battling to re-build trust after a series of recalls since 2009.

In November, Toyota recalled 2.7 million vehicles worldwide, including 75,000 in Britain, because of a steering wheel fault which could result in a ‘loss of steering ability’.

It said part of the lower steering column innards near the driver’s knee may ‘deform’ under certain conditions.

A month earlier, it was involved in the biggest single recall since 1996 when it revealed 7.43 million vehicles had been affected by malfunctioning power window switches.
