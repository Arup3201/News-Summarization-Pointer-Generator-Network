Millions of Britons would prefer to have a current account with John Lewis or Asda rather than Britain’s disgraced banking giants, according to a report.

Published today, it reveals the level of anger felt by hard-working Britons towards banks, which have been hit by a series of scandals, from mis-selling insurance to manipulating key rates.

In a poll, around 1,300 adults were asked which brands they thought would be most trustworthy if the company moved into banking and offered current accounts.

Anger toward banks: Britons said they would trust companies John Lewis and Asda more than banking giants if the companies offered bank accounts

John Lewis, best-known for its ‘never knowingly undersold’ policy, came out top, with three in four adults saying they would trust it to take care of their cash.

Nearly half said they would trust Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership. Asda, Morrisons, House of Fraser and online retailer Amazon were also rated highly.

Meanwhile, less than one in ten said they believed their bank offered ‘the best value for money’, while only 37 per cent said they receive ‘good customer service’. Despite a deeply troubled five years, few rivals have emerged to compete for the customers of big banks such as Barclays, RBS and HSBC.

Banks deeply troubled: Less than one in ten said they believed their bank offered the best value while only 37 per cent said they received good customer service

In 2010, Metro Bank became the first high-street bank to open in the UK for more than 100 years. It has attracted around 50,000 personal current account customers.

And in October, Marks & Spencer will
launch a current account, but will charge either £15 or £20 per month 
for the service. Tesco and Virgin are also expected to launch current 
accounts.

Michael Ossei, a personal finance expert at comparison site Uswitch.com, which carried out the poll, said: ‘It is a telling reflection of the UK banking industry that consumers are willing to put their trust in brands that have no previous banking experience.’

Louis Brooke, of Move Your Money, which campaigns for people to switch from big banks to ethical, local or mutual alternatives, said: ‘For years, the big banks have not bothered competing in the current account market and instead made it as difficult as possible for customers to switch whilst swindling them for everything they can.

‘The banks contempt for their customers is finally coming home to roost.’ 

Recently Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, admitted there is widespread lack of trust in banks.

He said: ‘They doubt whether banks have their interests at heart.’
