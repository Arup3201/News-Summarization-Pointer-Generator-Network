The years finally seem to be catching up with Phil Neville after the former Manchester United star debuted a new look on  Match of the Day 2.

Neville's trademark blond highlights were noticeably dull as he sat down to talk about Sunday's Premier League action with presenter Mark Chapman and Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown.

The 38-year-old appears to have ditched the peroxide in favour of a darker dye to rid himself of the grey which has crept in since his retirement in 2013.

Neville first began highlighting his hair back in 2000 as he established himself as United's utility man under Sir Alex Ferguson.

He retained the same look throughout the rest of his playing career with England and Everton before hanging up his boots to become a coach at Old Trafford under David Moyes.

Neville has stuck with a similar hairstyle while working as a pundit for BT Sport and the BBC since his retirement but he appears to have decided that it's time for a change.

Neville's hair sparked plenty of reaction on Twitter, with some people questioning his new look.

User @ColmBrien tweeted: 'Did Phil Neville die (sic) his hair?? Something looks different anyway #motd2'
