June Steenkamp has said the image of Oscar Pistorius covered in her daughter Reeva's blood, taken moments after he shot her, will never be removed from her mind.

In her first radio interview, Reeva's mother said she and her estranged husband Barry have nightmares about their daughter's final moments in the toiled cubicle.

Mrs Steenkamp, 67, also revealed that she does not think the 27-year-old Paralympian loved her daughter, but saw her 'as a trophy'.

Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead by her boyfriend, Oscar 'Bladerunner' Pistorius, in his home on Valentine's Day 2013.

Claiming he believed she was a burglar, Pistorius fired three shots through the door of a toilet cubicle where Reeva was, killing her. 

'We have nightmares about it [Reeva's final moments] the whole time, that's been the hardest part to get though, that she would have been expecting God to come and saver her, and where were we?,' Mrs Steenkamp told BBC Radio5Live.

When asked about how she felt about seeing the images of Oscar Pistorius taken after he shot her daughter, which were show in in court during the trial, she said she would never forget it.

'That will never be removed from my mind. He looked like a mad person.

'I don't think he loved her, I think she was just a trophy.'

Mrs Steenkamp spoke to British radio the day after Pistorius' lawyers filed asked a judge to reject prosecutors' attempts to take the athlete's case to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal.

Prosecutors want to challenge Judge Thokozile Masipa's decision to acquit Pistorius of murder for killing Reeva Steenkamp.

Masipa instead found the double-amputee Olympic athlete guilty of a lesser charge of manslaughter and sentenced him to five years in prison.

Prosecutors want to appeal that verdict, saying Masipa made an error in her interpretation of the law. They said they also want to appeal the sentence, calling it 'shockingly light.' 

Guilty in her eyes: Mrs Steenkamp says that Pistorius has taken everything away from her and Barry, and that he should not have been acquitted of murder

Big heart: Reeva's mother says she has forgiven Pistorius and wishes him luck in his life as he will have to live with what he did

Mrs Steenkamp called Pistorius acquittal of murder 'a horrendous mistake', but said that she has forgiven the 27-year-old Paralympian.

'He has taken everything away from us. She will never have out grandchildren, she will never have a wedding, never have a career.

'She was doing brilliantly, she had a law degree, she was going places.

I have forgiven him, I have to, and I can't hold that hatred in my heart, if I'm going to survive this.

'Good luck to him whatever happens in his life, he is still going to have to live with his thoughts, what happened to him. It's not going to change my life, she is never coming back.'

Pistorius, who turns 28 this weekend, could be released from jail to go under house arrest after 10 months in prison. He is currently serving his sentence at a prison in the South African capital, Pretoria.

If on the appeal Pistorius is convicted of murder, he would face a minimum of 15 years in prison.

The prosecution filed its initial appeal papers earlier this month. They must first ask Masipa for permission to take the case to the Supreme Court of Appeal and a hearing with Masipa is scheduled for Dec. 9.
