No bride wants to be upstaged on her wedding day. But Amanda Vasey was more than happy to share the limelight...when her best friend went into labour moments after arriving for the ceremony.

Amanda Hutchinson, wife of best man Gareth, had declined to be a bridesmaid because she was worried she would ruin the wedding photos in her heavily pregnant state.

However, the last thing the 28-year-old had  expected was to end up as the centre of attention by giving birth on the day.

Despite the surprising manner of delivery, the couple gave birth to a healthy, as-yet-unnamed, baby girl

As her waters broke and she was helped
 to a car outside the hotel wedding venue, the mother of the bride, 
bridesmaids and Gareth, 28, rushed off to help with bed sheets to 
preserve her modesty.

Despite all the commotion, Mrs Vasey, 
37, married Steven Vasey, 35, at the King’s Hotel in Darlington on 
schedule with an usher standing in for the best man. The newly-weds then
 decided to abandon their reception to go to their friend’s bedside. Mrs
 Vasey now admits one of her favourite photographs from the big day on 
Saturday is of her, her new husband, his best man and his wife in 
hospital with their new daughter and one-year-old son Alfie.

She said: ‘Amanda kept saying sorry 
she had ruined the day but she hadn’t ruined it. It’s a special blessing
 that the baby was born on the day Steven and I got married.

‘When we went to see her in the 
hospital we both cried. It was a really emotional day for me because I 
was marrying the love of my life and also our best friends were 
welcoming a little baby into the world.’ Mrs Vasey, a support worker 
from Darlington, said: ‘I desperately wanted Amanda to be part of my 
wedding, but when she found out she was pregnant she refused to be a 
bridesmaid. She thought she’d ruin the photos if she was too far on.

‘It’s funny because Amanda totally shied away from the wedding…but in the end it all ended up being about her.’

Luckily Mrs Hutchinson didn’t have to 
give birth in the car because an ambulance arrived and took her to 
hospital, where she had a healthy baby girl seven minutes later.
