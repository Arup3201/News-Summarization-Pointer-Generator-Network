Formula One legend Michael Schumacher made a will to distribute his £750 million cash, cars and property empire among his wife and two children just three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink of death.

Back in 2010 he admitted that he had made a will for the first time, telling a German magazine: 'Yes, I have made my testament because I am a family man. 

'But it is less about Formula One but because of the things that can happen in everyday life.'

Premonition: Former Formula One driver Michael Schumacher, pictured skiing in the northern Italy in 2005, made a will after a premonition about what could happen in 'everyday life'

Dangers: Seven time F1 champion Michael Schumacher was more concerned about possible mishaps off the track than dangers on the circuit, he told an interview in 2010

That premonition of 'everyday life' came sadly true on December 29 last year when he smashed his head on to a rock while skiing at the French resort of Meribel. 

The 45-year-old is still in an artificial coma at a hospital in Grenoble where he remains stable but seriously ill. Medics said today they have noted a ‘slight improvement’ in his health.

The will, he said, 'covers all those who are important to me.'

On Sunday his father Rold and brother Ralf were among the close family visitors at his bedside in Grenoble's University Hospital.

German media reported that a brain scan on Friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend.

Today doctors confirmed Schumacher was still in a 'critical' condition.

'The clinical state of Michael Schumacher is considered as stable and is being constantly monitored as he receives medical treatment,' a statement from Grenoble's University Hospital said.

'However, the medical team in charge of his care underlines that they continue to consider Michael's condition as critical.'

Speculation is mounting that French prosecutors may be preparing charges against the operators of the piste where Schumacher crashed.

A press conference will be held on 
Wednesday at 10am (GMT) in the Alpine town of Albertville, local 
prosecutor Patrick Quincy said.

Attorney Maurice Bodecher -  a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law and formerly Chief Judge of the French of Ski Federation until 2010 - has been retained by the piste management. 

If any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the Schumacher family.

The main question, according to German media, is whether the scene of the accident - full of rocks of the type that Schumacher collided with - was properly marked.

The new focus of the investigation comes as more evidence emerges to suggest speed was not a primary factor in the accident.

A German man, who was filming his girlfriend in the ski resort of Meribel, has come forward to say he inadvertently filmed Schumacher's crash on the slopes - and the footage shows the motoracing star was travelling at little more than 12mph.

Michael Schumacher was travelling at 12mph when he crashed, a witness claimed

Detectives in France were last night trying to get a copy of the smartphone video after the man, who has not been named, went to German news journal Der Spiegel.

Formula One legend Schumacher, who is still in a critical condition in an induced coma, was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow.

Der Spiegel said: ‘The man, a 35-year-old flight attendant from Essen, was just a few metres from the accident site on the slopes and was filming his girlfriend.

‘In the background of the film, slightly blurred, a skier can be seen in the unprepared part between the two slopes sliding over the snow.

‘According to the man, who contacted Der Spiegel on Friday, the skier was Schumacher. He is believed to have slowed down to a speed of up to 20kph.’

Police will tomorrow check footage from a tiny digital camera Schumacher wore on his helmet, after his family handed it over.

The statement corroborates claims made by Schumacher’s spokeswoman Sabine Kehm.

Earlier this week she denied Schumacher had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 60km/h.

She said: 'I think after having spoken with several people who have been with Michael at this moment, Michael and the group have been skiing on slopes that were normal slopes.

'Then there is a blue slope and a red slope, and in between there was a part which was deep snow, and Michael went into that.'
