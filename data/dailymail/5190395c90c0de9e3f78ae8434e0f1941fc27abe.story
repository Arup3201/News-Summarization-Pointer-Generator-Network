A row has broken out between two of Britain’s most historic cathedral cities after one accused the other of trying to 'steal' its Christmas shoppers.

Traders in Salisbury, Wiltshire, were left seething when a billboard went up in the city centre advertising a festive market in Winchester, Hampshire, 30 miles away.

They feared the poster - which described Winchester as 'England’s Christmas Capital' - would draw away valuable business.

Riled: Traders in Salisbury were left fuming when this poster for a Christmas market in neighbouring town Winchester appeared on their doorstep

Payback: Salisbury traders retaliated by erecting a poster for their own festive market by Winchester's railway station

Now they have hit back with their own market and poster - and placed it in view of thousands of commuters near Winchester’s railway station.

Salisbury hopes to attract some of the 400,000 people that spend around £1.5 million at the German-style market in Winchester each year.

The event - in the former capital of England - has been running in the picturesque grounds of Winchester Cathedral for six years.

An open air ice rink, live music, and wooden chalets selling a range of food and handmade gifts are said to boost sales in nearby shops by 25 per cent.

Lucrative: The Christmas market at Winchester pulls in 400,000 people a year and is said to be worth at least £1.5million to the local economy

Ian Newman, chairman of Salisbury City Centre Management, hopes Salisbury’s new Christmas market will help claw back some customers.

He said: 'A lot of traders in Salisbury were angry when Winchester tried to steal our customers by placing an advert in our city centre.

'They first did it last year and have done so again this year. In the current economic climate every customer is crucial and we cannot afford to lose them to other cities.

'We have wanted a Christmas market in Salisbury for many years and Winchester’s poster spurred us on to launch one this year.

'As part of our marketing we have placed a billboard poster in Winchester and are now taking them on - on their own turf.'

Rivalry: Salisbury traders say Winchester Christmas market is stealing their business

Charlotte Barnaville, from Winchester Christmas Market, welcomed the competition.

She said: 'The advert in Salisbury formed part of our wider marketing campaign and was not targeted specifically at them.

'We just want people to be aware of our event and are not trying to ‘steal’ customers.

'However, our poster does seem to have spurred them on and it is nice to have a bit of friendly competition between two great historic cities.'

She added: 'We are not overly concerned by their efforts because we are confident we still offer the best market and Christmas entertainment in England.'
