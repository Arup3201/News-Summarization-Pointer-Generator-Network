Google Glass could reverse the fortunes of struggling shops on the high street, according to a study.

Almost a third of consumers said they would be interested in using the gadget to access in-store promotions and be guided where to find the bargains in a shop.

Venda, a company that looks after Tesco’s eCommerce solutions, claims wearable technology could ‘revitalise’ tired shops by encouraging consumers to make impulse purchases.

Almost a third of consumers said they would be interested in using Google Glass to access in-store promotions and be guided where to find the bargains in a shop, according to an eCommerce company called Venda

Google Glass - high tech glasses that allow wearers to find information and take photos - is not yet available to UK consumers but 28 per cent of consumers would use the wearable technology to access in-store promotions, according to a poll of 2,000 UK adults.

The study found 45 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds would use the technology to search for available stock and product ideas to purchase while in store.

Venda believes Google Glass and other 
highly-anticipated wearable devices like Apple and Samsung's watches, 
have the ability to encourage consumers to buy more products in physical
shops.

It said: 'More than one in five consumers said they would like to be able to unlock additional offers and promotions, via digital screens such as billboards or store window displays, highlighting Google Glass’s ability to harness impulse buys through instant offers.'

Eric Abensur, Group CEO of Venda,said: 'Wearable technology has been identified as a...driving force for the high street's renaissance...and has the potential to help both consumers and retailers'

Consumers are increasingly using their smartphones when browsing shops to check that products are not cheaper elsewhere and the trend will probably become more popular if consumers embrace Google Glass.

The study found any moves by retailers to prevent the use of this technology in-store will be negatively received by consumers.

Over half of people surveyed thought that if shops did complain about them using the technology, they would conclude the retailers probably have something to hide, including higher prices and negative reviews.

The results suggest that retailers should embrace the adoption of Google Glass.

Eric Abensur, Group CEO of Venda,said: 'Wearable technology has been identified as a...driving force for the high street’s renaissance...and has the potential to help both consumers and retailers.

'Consumers will be able to make informed purchase decisions and redeem offers, while Glass will help retailers promote the visibility of products on social networks,' as 16 per cent of shoppers are more likely to share their purchases using social media, according to the survey.

However, a significant barrier to the adoption of Google Glass might be its appearance.

Just under 80 per cent of UK adults said they would feel a 'degree of embarrassment' using the wearable technology, with women feeling potentially more self conscious.

Around a third of people think Google Glass would be awkward for them to wear and but 13 per cent said they would simply put the spectacles on inside shops to get the best deals.

Mr Abensur said: 'Google transformed the eCommerce space and is now set to do the same for retailers with bricks and mortar stores.'

'There is no reason to assume that the high 
street will become redundant as this type of technology becomes 
ubiquitous...In fact, our research clearly shows that there is an 
appetite among consumers for this type of technology in-store.'
