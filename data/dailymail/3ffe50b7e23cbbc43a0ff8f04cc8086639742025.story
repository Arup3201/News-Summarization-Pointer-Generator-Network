If Sonya 'The Black Widow' Thomas opts to have something other than turkey this Thanksgiving, she may be forgiven.

That's because the competitive eater has just broken another record - after scoffing 5lbs worth of the bird's meat in just ten minutes.

The 5ft 5in 105lb woman claimed the record as part of the Wild Turkey 81 Eating World Championship, held in Times Square, New York, yesterday.

Champion! Sonya 'The Black Widow' Thomas shows off her trophy after eating 5lbs of turkey meat in ten minutes to add another competitive food eating record to her collection

No cutlery required: Thomas and her rival Eric Booker, left, tuck into the turkey while showing off their different ways of tackling the challenge

Thomas's victory was made more remarkable as she crushed her nearest rivals - all men - by more than a pound of meat.

Her feat saw her collect a cash prize of $1,581 and adding another title to her collection of world records.

Speaking after her victory, the 42-year-old told the New York Daily News: 'I left only bone. I’m so happy.'

'I’m not normally a fan of turkey... but their turkey today was 
very tasty, moist and warm. That’s why I ate most of the meat.'

Thomas, who is from Alexandria, Virginia, and works as a restaurant manager, used a less frenzied technique to eat the bird during the contest.

Even though Thomas weighs just 105 lbs, she owns a slew of eating records

In
the zone: Sonya concentrates while scoffing another chicken wing - one 
of 183 she managed in 12 minutes - to break her own record in September

While no competitor uses cutlery, Thomas stripped handfuls of meat from the bird and placed the pieces in her mouth while drinking water in between.

Asparagus - 5.75lbs deep fried in 10 minutes

Burgers - 7 3/4 pounders in 10 minutes

Cheesecakes - 11lbs in 9 minutes.

Chicken nuggets - 80 in 5 minutes

Chicken wings - 183 in 12 minutes

Crabcakes - 46 3oz cakes in 10 minutes

Eggs - 65 hard boiled in 6 minutes, 40 seconds

Fruitcakes - 4lbs, 14oz  in 10 minutes

Gyoza - 206 n 10 minutes

Jambalaya - 9lbs of crayfish variety in 10 mins

Lobster - 11.3lbs of meat in 12 minutes

MoonPies - 38 in 8 minutes

Oysters - 46 dozen in 10 minutes

Pizza - 6 extra large pizza slices in 15 minutes

Pulled pork - 23 sandwiches in 10 minutes

Tacos -  43 soft tacos in 11 minutes

Tater tots -  250 tater tots in 5 minutes

Thomas's technique differed vastly from Eric Booker, who claimed second prize in the contest.

The 400-pound man, nicknamed 'Badlands', picked up the bird in one hand and gnawed away using a technique more suited to a chicken leg.

Booker said of his strategy: 'I just ripped the bird apart and ate the innards. 'I think I ate the wishbone by accident.'

Booker, who holds his own world record for eating pumpkin pies, praised his fellow competitor.

He added: 'I’m definitely in awe of her abilities, to be so small and eat so 
much.'

Thomas's success in New York follows several other world records.

In September she managed to eat 183 chicken wings in just 12 minutes, breaking her own record.

And in July she became the first Female World Hot Dog 
Eating Champion by swallowing 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes.

She also has records for eating in several 
other categories including cheesecakes, crayfish, oysters and jalapenos.

And for anyone wondering what Sonya is having this Thursday - she is planning a feast with Korean food.
