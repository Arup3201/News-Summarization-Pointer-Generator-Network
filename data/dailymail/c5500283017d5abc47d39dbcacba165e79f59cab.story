InStyle magazine has taken to Twitter to deny allegations that it intentionally whitened Scandal actress Kerry Washington's skin in an image featured on the cover of this month's issue.

In a statement released on Thursday evening, which was later retweeted by 38-year-old Kerry, the magazine blamed the actress' seemingly altered appearance on the 'lighting' of the cover.

'We are super fans of Kerry Washington here at InStyle,' the statement explained. 'To feature her on the cover of our March spring fashion issue is both an honor and a delight.

'We have heard from those who have spoken out about our newsstand cover photograph, concerned that Kerry’s skin tone was lightened. While we did not digitally lighten Kerry’s skin tone, our cover lighting has likely contributed to this concern. We understand that this has resulted in disappointment and hurt. 

'We are listening, and the feedback has been valuable. We are committed to ensuring that this experience has a positive influence on the ways in which we present all women going forward.'

Posting on her own Twitter account, Kerry thanked the publication for making such a 'beautiful statement', adding that she was grateful the magazine had taken the time to open up such an 'important' conversation.

Alongside a link to InStyle's official statement, she wrote: 'Beautiful statement. Thank u 4 opening this convo. Its an important 1 that needs to be had.'

Critics first began speculating that InStyle had edited Kerry's cover image in order to purposefully 'whitewash' the star and drastically alter her appearance on Wednesday, shortly after the actress shared the image on her social media accounts..

Kerry happily took to Instagram to reveal the cover, writing: 'I'm THRILLED to share with you all that I'm on the cover of this year's March @instylemagazine! Can't wait for you guys to see it and read it! So honored. And crazy excited.'

But many of her fans were unable to feign pleasure over the image – and quickly responded to share their outrage at the overly-edited image.

False representation: One woman called out the magazine on Instagram, calling the InStyle cover 'an egregious mistake'

Angry customer: Another critic said she would never buy InStyle again because the magazine made Kerry 'look white'

An unhappy man: This Twitter user also accused the magazine of 'whitewashing' the actress 

Many voiced their thoughts by posting in the comments section under Kerry’s image, lashing out at what they described as a ‘false representation’ of the Scandal star.

One woman went as far as to suggest that the magazine should issue an apology to Kerry for altering the image so drastically, referring to the cover as 'an egregious mistake'.

'You mean to tell me your editors saw fit to Photoshop @kerrywashington to the point where not only is her completion is severely lightened but the ENTIRE character of her face is altered?' she fumed. 'Your magazine needs to issue a statement of apology not only to your readers but to Kerry Washington as well.'

Another woman chimed in to say that she would boycotting the magazine from here on out, adding that she was ‘disgusted’ at the behavior of the magazine’s editors.

'Sooooo what you guys do it brighten the photo to a point that Kerry looks WHITE!?? Never buying your magazine again. I'm DISGUSTED! #BLACKISBEAUTIFUL!' she wrote.

Someone else added: 'They removed everything that makes her Kerry. Why the lighter skin, why the thinner lips? Lord forgive them.'  

Critics also took to Twitter to share their disgust.

'Some woman pretending to be Kerry Washington is on the cover of InStyle magazine. #Scandal,' someone wrote.

Another man added: 'What did InStyle Magazine do to my Kerry Washington?! The picture doesn't even look like her #whitewashing #Instylemagazinecovers .'

This isn't the first time fans have been left outraged by one of Kerry's cover photos, nor is InStyle the first magazine called out for supposedly lightening someone's skin.

Many people felt that Kerry’s December 2013/January 2014 cover of Lucky had been edited beyond all recognition, with many voicing similar concerns about the apparent lightening of her skin color.

Meanwhile, Lupita Nyong'o's 2014 spread in Vanity Fair saw similar criticisms.

And in 2010, Elle was accused of lightening Gabourey Sidibe's skin for its 25th anniversary issue, but the magazine maintained that the cover appearance was the result of studio lighting. 

Beyond the cover, Kerry spoke with the magazine about her red carpet style and her Olivia Pope-inspired clothing line for The Limited.

The Scandal star noted her personal style is more daring than her fashionable television character's.  

'Red-Carpet Kerry wears a lot more color and pattern than Olivia does,' she explained. 'She makes bold choices.

She continued: 'When I was pregnant, I showed up at the SAG awards in a bare-midriff gown by Prada. I knew some people were going to hate it, but I thought it was super cute and really fun.'

While she had no problem flaunting her baby bump, the new mom said she relied on pilates, Tracy Anderson pregnancy DVDs, hiking, the elliptical machine and yoga get her figure back after giving birth to her daughter Isabelle in May.

She also talked about her experience as a working mom with a young child. 

'Women use this "guilt" word a lot, but I’m not sure how I feel about it,' she explained. 'I know why it’s the word that keeps coming up, but I can’t co-sign on it yet... You can’t be all things to all people all the time. 

'You have to experience your humanity, you have to know you are a limited vessel, and you can only do so much.'
