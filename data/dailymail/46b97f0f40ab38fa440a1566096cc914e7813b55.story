Arsene Wenger should prioritise the signing of a top-class forward ahead of any pursuit of Cesc Fabregas, former Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour has told the Daily Mirror.

The Gunners have been linked with a move for their former captain, whose future appears uncertain at Barcelona following the appointment of new manager Luis Enrique and a struggle to establish himself as a first-team regular.

But Parlour believes if Arsenal want to compete for the Premier League title alongside the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool then they must beef up their goalscoring options and give Olivier Giroud more support.

Reinforcements: But Arsene Wenger must sign new strikers before more midfielders, Ray Parlour believes

He said: 'The problem with Fabregas is where do you put him in the team?

'They have got very similar players to Fabregas – they have Mesut Ozil, Santi Cazorla, Jack Wilshere – if you bring Fabregas back where do you fit him in?

'He was great for the club but forwards should be much more of a priority.

'You look at Manchester City and Liverpool and they have much better forwards.'

Arsenal were linked with a move for a new forward in the January transfer window to assist 22-goal top scorer Giroud but only signed midfielder Kim Kallstrom on loan.

This summer the club have been reportedly eyeing QPR's Loic Remy, Bayern Munich's Mario Mandzukic and Real Madrid's Karim Benzema.
