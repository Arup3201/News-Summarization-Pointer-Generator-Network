A man shot dead in an apparent gangland execution had appeared in a music video with X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos.

The man, named locally as Reece James, 21, was shot in the face in what police have believe was a 'pre-planned and targeted' attack.

Mr James, who was also known by the street name 'Stylie', had travelled from his home in Wembley, London, to a notoriously crime-ridden area of Boscombe in Bournemouth.

'Pre-planned attack': The victim of the shooting in Boscombe in Bournemouth is believed to be Reece James, left, who starred in Tulisa's music video - where the singer made a sign associated with gangs, pictured right

Reece James Menzies was killed in what was a suspected gang related murder

His body was found at around 2.30am on 
Wednesday morning at an address in Roumelia Lane - an area in which 
Somali drugs gangs are reported to operate.

One 22-year-old man has been arrested, but police have said they believe the attack involved 'a number of offenders'.

Although the victim is yet to be 
formally identified, he has been named locally and on Twitter as Mr 
James, who appeared alongside pop star Tulisa, 24, in the music video for her single Live it Up, which was 
filmed on the Church End housing estate in Harlesden, North West London,
earlier this month.

Controversial: Tulisa denied suggestions she referenced the Church Road Soldiers gang in this video, which also starred Reece James

Crime scene: The scene of the shooting in Boscombe, Bournemouth, remained cordoned off yesterday as police launched a murder investigation

The singer and X Factor judge was forced to deny suggestions that scenes of her making a 'C' shape with her hand in the video was a reference to Harlesden gang the Crime Scene Boys - or Church Road Soldiers.

Tulisa maintained that she was referencing Camden, her hometown.

But tributes left for Mr James online suggested that he was linked to the Church Road Soldiers gang.

The scene in Roumelia Lane was cordoned off after the shooting on Wednesday morning.

Strong: Tulisa, outside the High Court after winning a legal victory over her sex tape, has made every effort to distance herself from gangland violence while some suggest she courts the controversy

Detective Chief Inspector Kevin Connolly, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Team, said: 'We are still investigating the circumstances of this death but I believe it was a pre-planned and targeted attack by a number of offenders.'

Local MP Tobias Ellwood described the shooting as a 'spillover from the drugs turf war in the capital'.

'This was one London gang chasing down another, carrying out a professional hit and then going back,' he told the Bournemouth Echo.
