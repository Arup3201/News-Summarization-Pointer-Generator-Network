A Florida woman is lucky to be alive after she was bit by what authorities suspect was a shark while boating with friends Sunday afternoon.

Jessica Vaughn was inner-tubing with friends in Fort Lauderdale's Intracoastal Waterway about 2 p.m. when she felt something grab her leg.

Vaughn told authorities that she then felt a large fin hit her in the head before she'd realized what had happened.

Friends say they saw a splash and then heard Vaughn briefly scream, which is when someone told her to get back on the boat. The friend later told police they saw a four-foot bull shark in the water near where Vaughn had been bit.

'We were tubing, and I was just in the water for about 25 minutes,' Vaughn's boyfriend, Peter Hogge, tells WSVN. 'We stopped, she had a life vest on, she went in, another friend went in with her, she got to her tube and "boom.'"

Kyle Branston, who was in the water with Vaughn when she was bit, tells the station, 'she started saying something bit her or cut her - something. So as I'm getting closer, I see the cut mark on her leg and I was, like, I didn't know what it was at first. I thought she got caught by a glass bottle.'

It wasn't until Vaughn was on the boat that they realized the extent of what had happened.

After it became apparent that Vaughn had been bit by a shark, the driver of the boat sped to a nearby home at 511 Bayshore Drive and began yelling for help.

Someone at the residence called 9-1-1 and an ambulance was dispatched to treat Vaughn.

Vaughn was taken to Broward General Hospital, where she underwent surgery to repair the damage to her leg. She is expected to recover.

The Intracoastal is a series of canals and waterways with outlets to the
 Atlantic Ocean. Sharks have been spotted in the Intracoastal in the 
past, but sightings are not common in the inland waterway, which is popular for yachting and water sports.

Friends told WPLG that just prior to the attack, Vaughn was joking about how she was afraid something in the water would attack her. Sure enough, '30 seconds later,' Vaughn was bit by the shark.

Friends say Vaughn handled the situation well, and didn't panic after the attack,

'She took it like a champ - she wasn't freaking out much at all,' friend Nick Russo told the station.
