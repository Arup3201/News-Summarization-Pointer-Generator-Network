Crishla, who was in the helicopter with Jordan when he was airlifted to hospital, posted an emotional tribute on Sunday afternoon saying that he had died at 3.45pm.

'The moment god took you from me... is the moment he took apart of me too,' she said.

'In the end your with us in spirit my bro I know you'll always be watching over us and I love you soooooo much you have no idea my bro save a spot for me up in heaven for me.'

The teenager had been cleared to play five weeks ago after suffering a serious head injury at the start of the season, the Northern Advocate reports.

Kevin Robinson, the president of Jordan's club Otamatea, was at the game and witnessed the teenager falling to the ground before getting back up on his feet.

'He fell down but then got up and staggered around before falling over again,' he said.

'He was looked after immediately and the game was called off.'

Mr Robinson was also by Jordan's side when he was knocked out by a knee to the head several weeks ago.

He had been 'blue-carded' at the start of the season - a system that gives referees the option to order concussed players off the field for three weeks - and had four weeks off from playing.

'That was awful. It was not nice to see,' Mr Robinson said, adding that Jordan had made a full recovery after the first hit.

The Northland Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby Union and the Rugby Foundation issued a statement on Sunday saying Jordan's injuries and death were being investigated.

'This is a tragedy for all concerned, in particular Jordanâ€™s immediate whanau and friends,' the statement read.

'Jordan was a young man with a passion for life and for Rugby, he was a great guy from an awesome family and will be sadly missed by all who knew him.
