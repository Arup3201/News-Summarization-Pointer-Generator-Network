The Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy could help save the Union, polling experts said today.

The royal couple's decision to reveal Prince George will have a sibling could stir a late swell of support for keeping the United Kingdom together with ten days until the knife-edge vote.

A new poll today revealed many voters demanding an independent Scotland, or still undecided about the issue, want to keep the Queen as head of state.

Within minutes of Kensington Palace's announcement today there was speculation about whether the Duchess' second pregnancy could be the boost the stuttering 'no' campaign needs and sway voters.

Could the baby save the Union? The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured in Scotland in May, could influence the outcome of the independence ballot because many no voters consider themselves monarchists

Titles: The royals have strong links with Scotland and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge use their titles of the Earl and Countess of Strathearn whenever they are there (pictured on a distillery tour this summer)

Support: Alex Salmond congratulated the couple today using their Scottish titles. He says the Queen will remain head of state if he wins but others in his party disagree

A YouGov poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent, with the No camp on 49 per cent. The Better Together campaign has surrendered a 22-point lead in the space of a month.

On the back of this the Queen held talks with David Cameron yesterday amid panic at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union, and there is said to be ‘great concern’ at Buckingham Palace about the result. 

Experts said today that Her Majesty's  worries and news of the royal baby could mark a key point in the campaign.

A spokesman for ComRes told MailOnline: ‘The Queen is generally very popular in the UK and so are the young royals like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, probably more so than Prince Charles for example.

‘The royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the Queen’s reported concerns and now Kate’s pregnancy will bring that into focus.

‘There are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. It won’t be just because of the baby, but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result’.

The Queen, pictured at the Braemar Gathering in Scotland, is thought to be strongly in favour of the Union and will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK. Her influence could save the Union

But a poll in The Times today found that 40 per cent of yes voters say an independent Scotland should keep the Queen. A further 14 per cent of undecided voters are also monarchists.

However it also emerged that yes voters are more anti-monarchist that first thought even though Alex Salmond has pledged that the Queen would stay as head of state. 

But the SNP’s John Mason and others are  calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after Her Majesty steps down or dies.

The royals have strong links with Scotland, with the Queen always spending her summers at Balmoral.

A senior royal source was quoted as saying: ‘The Queen is a Unionist. Lots of people were telling us that it was going to be OK but there is now a great deal of concern.’ 

In May the Duchess of Cambridge – using her Scottish title the Countess of Strathearn – visited Scotland.

Kate and her husband, also given the title Earl of Strathearn by the Queen on his marriage, were on a visit to the country’s oldest distillery, Glenturret, home to The Famous Grouse Experience.

David Cameron, at Balmoral yesterday with the Queen, was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘emotional argument’ about all that England and Scotland have achieved together and what ‘we can continue to achieve’.

Pro-Union MPs said her presence at Balmoral would be a sign of continuity.

‘There is a strong anti-monarchy element in the Scottish National Party,’ said former defence secretary Liam Fox. 

‘You can bet your bottom dollar as soon as they get independence, their next target is going to be Scotland being a republic.’

Sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the Highlands, on September 18. The Palace insisted that the Queen was politically neutral, but one well-placed source said: ‘You don’t have to be a genius to work out the Queen is a Unionist. Is the Pope a Catholic?’

A Palace spokesman said: ‘The referendum is a matter for the people of Scotland: the Queen remains strictly neutral on this, as she does on all political issues. The Queen has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way.’
