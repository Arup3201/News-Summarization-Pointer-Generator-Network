Chelsea captain and former England footballer John Terry has been pictured in two new gleaming luxury cars with an estimated combined price tag of £375,000.

With the football season not even begun the player - who had an affair with model Vanessa Perroncel, the former partner of fellow England defender Wayne Bridge - has splashed out on the luxury cars.

Ironically, the sporty two-door Wraith released by Rolls-Royce in 2014 is described as 'a debonair gentleman's GT'. It
 costs in the region of £235,000.

Still in his training kit, Terry pulls up to a country pub near to the Chelsea training ground in his brand new 2014 Rolls-Royce to meet his wife Toni Poole for lunch.

In an unusual design feature, the rear-hinged doors require the driver to reverse themselves into the seat, as Terry demonstrates elegantly.

Terry parked his flash new car on yellow lines at the front of the pub for 45 minutes, rather then opting to use the car park at the rear.

The next day the defender was also seen greeting female fans on the local high street in Surrey.

Terry then took off in his new special edition gold Range Rover Overfinch 4x4.

The Overfinch can be bespoke built to the owner's specifications, including the vehicle colour, wheels, interior design, trim colour and accessories and more. Similar ready-made versions of this vehicle cost in the region of £140k.
