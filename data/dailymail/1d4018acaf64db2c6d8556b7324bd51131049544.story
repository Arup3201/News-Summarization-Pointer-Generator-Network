David Cameron will this week come under mounting pressure to make sure families forced to miss their holidays because of the Government's passport crisis get their money back.

Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said ministers urgently needed to look into compensation schemes for those who couldn't go abroad as a result of lengthy delays in processing their passports and vowed to press the Government on the issue in Parliament tomorrow.

He said he would be tabling parliamentary questions about what the Coalition is doing to discuss the situation with insurance companies for those with travel policies.

He told the Murnaghan programme on Sky News: 'I want to explore this week - and I will be tabling parliamentary questions tomorrow - what the Government are doing to discuss with insurance companies for people who have taken out travel insurance. But it is a real issue.'

The Financial Ombudsman, which deals with disputes between the public and finance firms, has said it may ask an insurer to pay the claim for a cancelled holiday as long as the policyholder had 'done all they reasonably could to chase the passport application' and had 'put in their passport application in far in advance of the deadlines laid down by the passport office'.

In a statement last week it said: 'If they (the holidaymaker) were still unable to travel due to the delays, then we would be looking for the insurer to act in the spirit of the insurance policy.'

The development came after the Home Secretary Theresa May announced a raft of measures on Thursday designed to clear the application backlog. She said passport applications would be fast-tracked for free for those who need to travel abroad urgently.

In an emergency Commons statement, Mrs May insisted the Government was doing all it could to deal with the backlog of more than 30,000 applications which had not been dealt with within the normal three-week deadline.  

But there are growing fears that Mrs May's decision to draft in emergency staff to clear the backlog could leave the passport service open to risk.

It emerged today that 1,000 passports could be issued to ‘suspect’ overseas applicants because staff are not carrying out standard checks due to the huge backlog at the Passport Office.

These documents could be issued within the next fortnight, sources within Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO) claim, despite Home Secretary Theresa May’s vow that security would not be compromised.

The security loophole has been exposed after staff in the HMPO’s ‘Special Security Division’ were diverted to help clear up the chaos elsewhere.

These highly trained officials are usually responsible for carrying out multiple fraud checks on documents sent in with overseas applications. 

The problem is being compounded by the drafting in of inexperienced staff who are unable to spot suspicious answers on applications and alert the Special Security Division.

A source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘All hands are being called to the pumps and the Security Division is now like one man and a dog for the rest of the month with the majority of staff transferred to other duties.

‘The Security Division estimates that within the next couple of weeks, because of this panic, there will be at least 1,000 “unsecure” passports issued to “suspect” persons.’ 

Last week, Theresa May confirmed that responsibility for dealing with applications for passports overseas had switched three months ago from British consulates abroad to an online system based in the UK monitored by HMPO. 

She said the change was made to provide better value for money and to ensure more ‘consistency’ of service. She stressed that security would not be compromised.

But the HMPO source added: ‘At one of the major Passport Office hubs, in Glasgow, they’ve now been lumped with passport applications from every registry throughout the world, which have to be checked, double-checked and triple-checked. The Security Division handles the potentially fraudulent applications and subjects them to rigid scrutiny.

‘There is a template system in place to sift suspicious applications which Passport Office staff have been trained to recognise.

‘But the Government is drafting in inexperienced Border Agency staff to help. The problem is that they will not recognise certain key answers that would alert full-time staff.’

The Security Division was set up after it was discovered ‘bulk’ applications mainly by Eastern European gangsters were being made for British passports and a small number had been processed.

Home Secretary Theresa May has vowed that security will not be comprised while the passport application backlog is tackled

As the Glasgow team picked up on the problem, it was decided to base the unit there. Last week, leaked documents from the HMPO revealed a plan to ‘relax’ checks on applications from overseas. The Home Office said it had been ‘unaware’ of the proposed change and ordered the guidelines to be withdrawn.

An HMPO spokesman said: ‘Security is our priority and we will not issue a passport until all  necessary checks have been satisfactorily completed.’

Meanwhile, civil servants at HMPO received bonuses worth more than £1.8 million last year, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. The bonuses were paid out to thousands of employees for ‘good performance’ at the service, which now has a backlog of 500,000 applications.

More than 94 per cent received the ‘in-year’ bonus, supposed to be handed out to staff who have exceeded ‘key business targets’.

Sarah Rapson, the former chief executive, received a bonus worth between £5,000 and £10,000 in 2012/13. On Tuesday the current chief executive, Paul Pugh, will go before the Home Affairs Select Committee to face questioning over the crisis.

Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is unbelievable that bonuses have been paid to those who have presided over a service that is now a byword for incompetence.’
