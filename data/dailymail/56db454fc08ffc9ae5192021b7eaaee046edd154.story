It is the incident the whole world is talking about - yet Liverpool have conveniently left out Luis Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini from their Uruguay-Italy match report on their club website.

Suarez appeared to sink his teeth into the veteran defender's shoulder during the World Cup Group D clash yet Liverpool make no mention of it at all in their report.

Uruguay won the match 1-0 through an 81st-minute Diego Godin header to book their place in the last 16, where they will face Colombia.

But the match was overshadowed by Suarez's seemingly unprovoked action.

The liverpoolfc.com report read: 'Luis Suarez completed the 90 minutes as Uruguay booked their place in the last 16 of the World Cup with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over 10-man Italy.'

It is the third time which Suarez has appeared to bite opposition players.

In 2010 he sunk into teeth into PSV's Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax, and in 2013 he was suspended for 10 matches for biting Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic at Anfield.
