A two-year-old suffered an agonising death after drinking toxic liquid his mother was using to help grow cannabis in his bedroom, a court heard yesterday.

Aaron Booth had not eaten all morning and went hunting for food and drink at lunchtime because his mother was still in bed with her boyfriend, the court was told.

He probably mistook the bottle for a children’s fruit drink.

The container of PH Up had been left 
on a windowsill within easy reach of the inquisitive toddler in the 
cannabis farm that his mother had set up to make money, it was alleged.

Lauren Booth, 24, was woken by a bang
and found her son had collapsed, was gasping for breath, with brown 
lips and clearly in pain, Bradford Crown Court heard.

He was rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery to remove his stomach and part of his oesophagus.

But his windpipe had also been burned
away by the potassium hydroxide chemical and the internal injuries were
so bad that nothing could be done.

Doctors withdrew treatment and he died on November 17,  11 days after the accident.

Yesterday Booth, of Huddersfield, 
denied wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting or abandoning her 
son in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury.

PH Up is used in the soil-free 
cultivation of plants, and drinking just two teaspoons of the corrosive 
substance would be fatal.

The bottle had a child-proof top and 
contained the warning: ‘Causes burns. Keep locked up and out of reach of
children.’ Prosecutor Tom Storey said: ‘It is a clear liquid in a 
small, blue, plastic bottle. To a young child it looks similar to a 
Fruit Shoot squash drink.’

Jobless Booth was in bed with her boyfriend, Shaun Williams, at 12.45pm on November 6 last year when the tragedy happened.

Mr Storey told the jury: ‘She had 
failed to get up and failed to provide Aaron with food and drink, and by
midday he must have been very hungry and thirsty.

‘He got hold of this bottle as he 
searched for something to eat and drink when left to his own devices – 
she preferred to stay in bed.’ The mother woke up to find Aaron 
collapsed beside her bed.

The court heard that Williams and Booth, with Aaron in her arms, ran to a neighbour’s house to raise the alarm.

He was taken to the local general 
hospital and transferred for specialist treatment at Leeds General 
Infirmary, but the internal injuries were too serious.

Mohammad Khan, the child’s father, told officers he had smelled cannabis on access visits to the house.

Booth had told him she and Williams had been trying to make money by growing ‘skunk’.

She seemed ‘annoyed’ that social 
services and police were involved, stating she was ‘going to have to 
find somewhere else’ to grow the cannabis, the court heard.

A laptop was seized on which a file had been downloaded called ‘Cannabis Big Book of Buds’.

Mr Storey said police found a 
cluttered house, but Aaron’s room was ‘curiously empty’, with black 
curtains and an open window on a cold November night.

The trial continues.
