Charged: Samora 'Black Dee' Roberts has been charged with drug offences and a firearm offence, police said today

One of the claimants featured on Channel 4’s controversial  Benefits Street has been charged with drug and firearms offences.

Samora Roberts, 32, who is better know to viewers of the hit reality TV series as ‘Black Dee’ has been charged with conspiracy to supply a class B drug, conspiracy to supply a class A drug (crack cocaine), possession of a Class A drug (diamorphine) and possession of ammunition for a firearm without a certificate.

Roberts and five of her neighbours were charged following a series of drug raids on properties in the now infamous James Turner Street in Birmingham .

One other young man who lives in the Handsworth area of the city has been charged as a result of the same raids.

All those charged have been bailed to appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on  February 6.

Roberts is one of the most high-profile subjects of the series, and details of the charges against her were made public yesterday afternoon, just hours after other reports alleged that she had recently been arrested for stealing a packet of condoms from a branch of Boots.

In a statement, West Midlands Police said the raids, which  took place last June, were a response to concerns raised by the local community.

The others who were charged include Charlene Wilson, 29, who has also appeared in the show and has been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine and cannabis (a class  B drug) and possession of diamorphine.

Four other residents on the street have also been charged.

Tina Thomas, 46, has been charged with conspiracy to  supply cannabis and possession of ammunition without a certificate. Ian Wright, 38, has been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine and cannabis. And Monique Walker, 28, and Marvin Scott, 37, who have both been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine.

Omari George, 20, from another road in Handsworth, has been charged with conspiracy to supply crack cocaine  and cannabis.

In total, seven people were charged with a number of offences. Six live in the street, the subject of the Channel 4 documentary

A spokesman for Channel 4 last night 
said it had no plans to make any changes to the show in light of the 
charges, despite the potential risk of prejudicing any future court 
cases. Benefits Street is the broadcaster’s biggest ratings hit since 
its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012.

Critics
 of the five-part series, which continues tomorrow night, have accused 
it of  glamorising crime, promoting drug use and celebrating welfare 
dependency.

The first 
episode featured a visit to a cannabis farm in  one of the street’s 137 
houses and an interview with a serial shoplifter who explained in detail
 how to dodge CCTV  cameras and remove security tags. Hundreds of 
viewers  complained about Channel 4 sharing apparent tips for would-be 
criminals.

Shoplifter 
‘Danny’ was shown returning from a shopping centre from which he had 
apparently stolen five jackets which he claims he can sell for £250.

The programme has courted controversy from the start, with the inhabitants of the street saying that the producers 'did anything they could' to get the most shocking footage

Another
 resident, called ‘Fungi’, was shown taking four magazines from a 
Premier Inn hotel. He referred to the magazines as his own ‘Big Issue’ 
and persuaded a woman in a sports car to buy one for £3.

The
 next two episodes, which  looked at the issues of immigration and drug 
use, have proved equally as controversial. Reports suggest that as many 
as 90 per cent of the residents on the street are dependent on benefits 
of one kind or another.

Channel
 4 and programme makers Love Productions claim the run-down, 
multi-ethnic street is typical of hundreds of communities across Britain
 struggling to cope with chronic economic and social decline.

But
 critics – who include some of the residents who originally agreed to 
take part – insist Channel 4 is indulging in ‘poverty porn’ and have 
accused producers of painting a false and particularly bleak picture of 
life on the street.

Roberts,
 who is unemployed is served with an eviction notice in one episode and 
is later shown advising one of her fellow residents to ‘claim your 
effing benefits, that’s what I effing say’.

She
 has since, however, become one of the programme’s most vocal critics 
and recently accused producers of treating her and her fellow residents 
‘like scum’.

The row over 
the programme has even reached the House of Commons, with Iain Duncan 
Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary claiming the behaviour depicted 
in the programme justified the Government’s clampdown on Britain’s 
benefits culture.
