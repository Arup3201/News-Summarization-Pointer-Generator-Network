Radiation from a stricken Japanese nuclear power station could have reached a potentially lethal point - prompting fears that its operator is struggling to maintain safety.

Radiation readings of 1,800 millisieverts (mSv) per hour  - 18 times the level at the same spot 10 days ago - have been detected at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant.

A dose this size of gamma radiation is high enough to kill a human exposed to it within four hours.

The revelations come after Japan's top nuclear regulator today raised 
safety concerns about hastily built storage tanks and their 
foundations amid signs of more leaks of radiation-contaminated water.

Concerns: Japan's top nuclear regulator raised safety concerns today about hastily built storage tanks and their foundations amid signs of more leaks of radiation-contaminated water

Nuclear Regulation Authority Chairman 
Shunichi Tanaka said that a small leak and signs of possible leaks have 
been spotted at several other Fukushima Dai-ichi storage tanks since a 
major leak in August which added to concerns about the plant's stability.

The new revelations will add to the increasing anger in Japan over the management of the disaster by the owner of the plant, Tokyo Electric Power Company.

There are increasing fears that news of more  leaks from the plant could affect Tokyo's bid for the 2020 Olympic Games which will be decided next Saturday.

A meeting about the leaks was 
postponed by Japanese MPs last week until after the decision by the 
International Olympic Committee was to be made. This has prompted 
allegations of a cover-up.

Following the latest worrying radiation readings, Tepco claimed last night that the radiation contained only 1mSv of gamma rays, The Times reported.

The firm said beta radiation, which is weaker, made up the rest of the radiation readings.

But Dr Richard Wakeford, a professor at Manchester University, told the newspaper that ratio would be 'most unusual', adding: 'Penetrating gamma rays would be lethal in a few hours.'

The plant's operator reported a loss of 300 tons of radiation-contaminated water from a steel tank on August 19, saying most of it is believed to have seeped underground but some might have escaped into the sea.

The company has yet to determine the cause or exactly where the water went.

The massive leak of water used to cool the plant's three melted reactor cores triggered fears of similar leaks from more than 300 other similar tanks.

The tanks are part of approximately 1,000 tanks holding 330,000 tons of contaminated water at the plant, where the radioactive waste water from the reactors grows by 400 tons daily.

The latest leaks have triggered further concerns about the plant's ability to manage the contaminated water. Experts have said that radiation-contaminated water leaking from underground and utility tunnels connected to reactors and turbine buildings has been leaking into the sea for some time.

Tanaka said he believed the discoveries of the subsequent leak and signs of possible leaks were the result of closer inspections after a leak two weeks ago. That leak was the worst from a tank at the plant, where three reactors melted down following the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Tanaka raised concerns about the safety of the foundations of the tank sites. TEPCO recently revealed that one of the tank sites had partially sunk during a test to see if the tank was watertight.

'Because those tanks were built in an emergency situation, it is questionable whether sufficient ground surveys were conducted,' Tanaka said. 'We believe experienced companies did a fine job, but we still have concerns and we must step up our watch for leaks.'

The plant's operator says the latest small leak was found over the weekend at a connecting pipe, and added it suspects possible leaks from at least three other tanks where high radioactivity was detected nearby, although it was not considered deadly.

The March 2011 earthquake and tsunami  in Japan destroyed the plant's power and cooling systems, causing three reactor cores to melt and fuel storage pools to overheat.

Since then, the plant is now using makeshift systems.
