The hacker who goes by the alias Guccifer and is known for releasing pictures of former President George W Bush's paintings has been captured in Romania.

Romanian authorities announced Wednesday that they arrested 40-year-old Marcel Lazar Lehel in the town of Arad.

The raid was organized by Romania's Directorate of Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) who said that they were cooperating with U.S. authorities.

Captured: Marcel Lazar Lehel, 40, was arrested in Arad, Romania on Wednesday. He is believed to be the hacker known as Guccifer

Outsmarted: Guccifer became known in the U.S. last year after leaking pictures from a Bush family member's email

Guccifer became known in the U.S. last year when he released pictures of former President George H.W. Bush in the hospital along with other former president George W Bush's hobby paintings.

While Bush II's paintings turned out to be more of a lighthearted hack, Guccifer eventually went on to expose the more serious secrets of America's powerful.

Guccifer hacked into the website of Colin Powell, revealing an affair between the former secretary of state and Romanian European Parliament member Corina Cretu - an affair the married man continues to deny. 

Targeted: Guccifer also took credit for hacking into Colin Powell's Facebook and writing negative messages about President Bush

Following Lehel's arrest Wednesday, DIICOT officials released a statement saying they had 'reasonable suspicion' that Lehel 'repeatedly and illegally accessed, breaking security rules, email accounts belonging to public persons in Romania with the aim of getting electronic mail confidential data.'

While Guccifer has only recently become a known hacker in the U.S., he has been targeting celebrities and officials in his home country for much longer.

In February 2012, Lehel was found guilty of dozens of hacking-related charges for electronic break-ins between October and July 2011.

In addition to American and Romanian politicians, Guccifer has also hacked Steve Martin, editor Tina Brown, journalist Carl Bernstein, Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellows and Sex and the City author Candace Bushnell.
