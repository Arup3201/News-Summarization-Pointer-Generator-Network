It followed the 30-year-old breaking his silence on the break-up from his girlfriend of seven years.

He thanked his fans on Twitter for their support.

'Hi everyone. I want to thank you all for the love & support during this tough time. It means the world to me. #TeamLH #bestfansintheworld', Lewis wrote.

Hamilton had returned to London on Wednesday amid reports he is trying to salvage his relationship with Scherzinger.

The Mercedes ace had chartered a private jet to fly him from Spain, where he had been testing at Circuito de Jerez, to England.

His return came after Scherzinger opened up that she still loves the Mercedes ace. 

Scherzinger admitted that she is 'devastated' when she called time on her long-term on/off romance with Hamilton.

The former X Factor judge's split from Hamilton was revealed on Wednesday and speaking to The Sun's Dan Wootton, she said: 'I'm devastated that it didn't work out. It was the hardest decision we had to make, but we made it together.' 

However, she claimed that the two are still bound by love for each other, despite this being their fourth break-up. 

'I love Lewis and I know he loves me,' she added.

'We wish nothing but happiness and the very best for one another. I'm trying to stay strong in my faith right now.

Despite the apparent friendliness between the two stars, though, a source alleged to the paper that part of the reason for their latest split was due to a series of rows over the festive period.
