Paul Lambert insists he is '100 per cent' certain Aston Villa will stay up despite recording a tenth match without a Premier League victory to slide into the relegation zone.

Villa slumped to a 2-0 defeat at Hull, courtesy of goals from Nikica Jelavic and Dame N'Doye, in a hugely important game at the foot of the table, prompting travelling fans to unfurl a banner reading 'Lambert Out' and chanting for their manager's head. A small crowd waited by the team bus after the final whistle to confront the squad.

It was the 15th Premier League game this season Villa have failed to score and, with 13 matches to go, intensifies genuine fears the club could fall into the Championship.

Lambert insisted that would not happen, but admitted his ambitions to play possession-based football would be abandoned in a bid to collect points by any means. He told each of his players 'make sure you don't buckle for your own career'.

Lambert said: 'I probably can't describe how low I feel. It's as flat as you can get (in the dressing room). I've just told the players there are 13 cup finals. We have to win them. There are a few teams in it who will fight to stay in the league. You have to make sure you're out of that bottom three. No matter what you do.

'There have been moments before when it's been hard. You can either meet it head on or you buckle under it. I still believe totally, 100 per cent that the football club will be fine. There are good players in the dressing room.

Villa players cut dejected figures at the final whistle after their 2-0 loss at the KC Stadium 

'Everybody is going to have to show character, from me right down. Big players rise to it. We've been trying to play the game the right way. We have to win ugly now. This is not a time for playing pretty football.

'It's not the first time I've seen (the banner). I can't do nothing about it, the fans pay good money. Whether that goes against the lads, I hope not. The players have to be big and strong enough to handle that.'
