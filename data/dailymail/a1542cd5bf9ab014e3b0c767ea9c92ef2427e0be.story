Sir Mervyn King, the departing Governor of the Bank of England, has a reputation for guarding his privacy.

But today he reveals how he sacrificed marriage and the prospect of a family for his career, until an unexpected phone call reunited him with his first love.

In a candid interview on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Sir Mervyn admits that he fell for Barbara Melander when they were both students at Cambridge in 1970.

First love: Sir Mervyn King fell for Barbara Melander in 1970 while they were students at Cambridge University

Sir Mervyn tells Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young that his ambitions made his personal life suffer

However, after she returned to her home in Finland, they lost touch until 30 years later when she suddenly telephoned him.

Barbara, an interior designer with two daughters, had been married to a Finnish businessman but divorced in 1996.

Sir Mervyn says: ‘We met at Frankfurt airport and I felt exactly the same about her as I had in 1970. She moved to England and we married in 2007.’

The ceremony was in Helsinki, with just a handful of family members present, and he has maintained a veil of secrecy around the event ever since.

The son of a railwayman who later became a teacher, Sir Mervyn, 65, confesses that his personal life suffered because of his determination to succeed.

‘I had relationships but never got married. I totally dedicated myself to my career. I travelled around the world for work and even in the summer I’d be off to the United States to teach. I never really had a domestic base.

‘The career always came first and that was probably a mistake. It was a sacrifice.’

He has been with the Bank of England for 22 years and tells presenter Kirsty Young: ‘Being Governor is actually one of the easiest jobs I have ever done. You are in charge but you have tremendous support.’

Critics claim that he rules with an iron fist, and he admits: ‘I demand a lot of others but no more than I demand of myself.’

Sir
Mervyn says that despite the banking crisis, he never has sleepless 
nights but understands fully why people have lost faith in the banking 
industry.

Sir Mervyn tells the programme that his successor Mark Carney, pictured, is an 'outstanding person'

‘What has surprised me is that people haven’t got angry sooner. It is only now that you see it coming out as the impact on standards of living are being affected.’

Of the August 2007 crisis, Sir Mervyn says: ‘We had believed the financial system as a whole was more resilient, we thought the risk was in the hands of people who knew how to manage it, but that was not true. Banks were very fragile.’

As for his successor, Mark Carney, he says: ‘He is an outstanding person and he must do the job his own way.’

For himself, Sir Mervyn says that in retirement his wife’s wishes will come first. He adds ‘I’ve promised my wife that I will learn to dance.’

Desert Island Discs is on  Radio 4 today at 11.15am.
