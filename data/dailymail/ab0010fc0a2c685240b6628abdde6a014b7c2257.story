Chelsea did the best business in the transfer window with Juan Cuadrado signing and Andre Schurrle and Ryan Bertrand being sold, according to Paul Scholes - but the former Manchester United midfielder had a warning for the new £27million signing.

Scholes was giving his views in his weekly column in The Independent and praised his old team's rivals for the nature in which they go about their business - and also the ruthlessness Jose Mourinho shows in handling out of form players. 

'As usual it looks like Chelsea have done the best business,' Scholes said. 'They seem to be clinical about it these days. You knew that if it was Juan Cuadrado they wanted, they would get him.

'Looking at his stats, I’m not sure that over the course of his career he is an outstanding goalscorer or maker of assists,' Scholes explained. 

'What is clear at Chelsea, however, is that if you do not perform you do not last long in the squad.'

Colombia international Cuadrado put pen to paper on a four-and-a-half year deal after his big-money switch from Fiorentina and winger Mohamed Salah moved the other way on loan.

Furthermore, Andre Schurrle was sold to Wolfsburg for £24m and left back Ryan Bertrand converted his loan switch into a permanent deal at Southampton for £10m.

The dealings mean that despite spending big on Cuadrado, Chelsea made a profit once all the transfers were sealed.
