With affordable prices and a fast delivery service, his pizza chain is hugely popular across America.

But now, Papa John - or John Schnatter - has been spotted indulging in a competitor's product.

The 53-year-old multi-millionaire was caught on camera eating what appeared to be a slice of pizza at a luxury hotel in Park City, Utah, this week.

And not only that, but he was seen consuming the pie in a sophisticated manner - with a fork.

'Exposed': The photo of Schnatter's meal sparked a storm of comments on social media sites, with some users dubbing Schnatter a 'traitor'. Above, one Twitter user wrote: 'Damn they exposed Papa John for real'

This is in contrast to many of his customers' preference to feast on his pizzas with just their hands.

It has sparked a storm of comments on social media, with some users dubbing Schnatter a 'traitor'. 

One man tweeted: 'Damn, they exposed Papa John for real. So shameful, eating a pizza with a fork.'

However, other users have responded sarcastically to image's publication.

A user named Steve added: 'Oh, the humanity!'

Founded in 1983, the Papa John's franchise had modest beginnings.

Fewer than 10 days into his term as New York City's mayor in January 2014, Bill de Blasio was caught up in a huge scandal when he was caught eating pizza with a knife and fork.

Now, every self respecting New Yorker knows that is a no-no, and caused de Blasio to have to issue a statement defending his enormous culinary faux-pau.

The wrong way Mr. Mayor: Bill de Blasio caused controversy with his fork 

The incident was dubbed Forkgate and de Blasio defended the approach, saying that his Italian ancestry that was behind his decidedly un-New York pizza-eating style.

'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and I’ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said.

It's a method New Yorkers variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter.

As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands.

Schnatter knocked out a broom closet in the back of his father's tavern in Jeffersonville, Indiana, before selling his beloved 1971 Z28 Camaro to buy $1,600 worth of second-hand pizza equipment.

Then, he started selling pizzas to the tavern's customers for a reasonable price. His pies proved so popular that Schnatter was able to expand his business just a year later. 

Now, the chain is the fourth largest take-out and pizza delivery service in the US, with more than 3,200 restaurants. Its slogan reads: 'Better Ingredients. Better Pizza. Papa John's.'

A further 800 restaurants are spread across 33 other countries, including the UK and Cyprus.

Thanks to the success of his business, Schnatter is now worth an estimated $600million.
