The date is October 10, 2013, the place is  The Grove Hotel,  England’s plush pre-game haven.

Roy Hodgson is hatching a plan for a must-win clash with Montenegro and a flying young winger is central to his plans. Tottenham’s Andros Townsend is about to be thrust into the big time.

On the same night in Serravale, the capital of San Marino, Raheem  Sterling is playing for England’s Under 21s in a Euro 2015 qualifier. He toils during a routine 4-0 win, exchanges words with team-mate Harry Kane over who should take a penalty and is eventually substituted after 65 minutes.

Star man: But on Saturday night, Sterling lit up the World Cup with a fine match against Italy

When Sterling returns to England, he receives a call from Hodgson to join the senior squad for the final Group H fixture with Poland but it is purely for educational purposes. Townsend sparkled against  Montenegro, kept his place in the starting line-up and looked certain to go to Brazil.

Not even Sterling’s biggest fan would have suggested back then that their respective roles would be reversed. The then 18-year-old was not playing for Liverpool, not thriving for the Under 21s and had been told by his club manager Brendan Rodgers to ‘stabilise his life’.

Given Sterling, who grew up in the shadows of Wembley Stadium, had faced two separate court appearances in May and August last year (he was never prosecuted), his talent would go unfulfilled if he continued down a path littered with distractions.

Liverpool had held Sterling in the highest esteem for an age. They paid an initial £600,000 to sign him from Queens Park Rangers in February 2010 when he was just 15 but as the nation started thinking about a trip to Brazil, all was not how it should have been.

The evidence was clear. Between October 19 and December 1, Sterling played just seven minutes for Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League. The only trip he looked like making at that juncture was on loan somewhere, as thoughts of the World Cup seemed fanciful.

Confidence: Italy couldn't deal with the young star in the Group D game in Manaus

Now look at him. His performance against Italy in Manaus on Saturday evening was the latest, compelling proof that Sterling’s talent is  burgeoning and he could become a mainstay of this England team for the next three, maybe even four, World Cup campaigns.

Blessed with scintillating pace, a sure touch and outstanding technique, his body strength should not be underestimated. His team-mates at Liverpool often talk of how robust he is in training and Italy midfielder Marco Veratti certainly received a jolt when they collided in Manaus.

‘He’s the toughest in our squad,’ says Liverpool and England  captain Steven Gerrard. ‘I don’t go near him in training because if I do, there is only one winner. He just needs to keep learning.’

That quality, more than any other, has been critical to his development these last seven months. Sterling, who has moved out of Liverpool city centre to a more conservative, tranquil area, has been pulled aside by his colleagues and told what he can achieve with concentration and dedication.

It should also not be forgotten the role Rodgers has played in his development. Liverpool’s manager has been tough with him — one particular dressing down was broadcast in the TV documentary Being: Liverpool in 2012 — but he has also filled him with confidence and given Sterling a platform to thrive.

Quality: Sterling has fought through the tough times at Liverpool to become a key performer

‘I thought when Raheem (first) started he was outstanding,’ said Rodgers. ‘Then he had a real dip in his performances for a number of reasons. But I am always fair with players. I always try to act in the best interests of them, if they are performing in training and showing a real focus.’

That focus was evident in the  sweltering atmosphere of the Arena Amazonia on Saturday night. He served notice of what was in store with a thumping third-minute shot into the side-netting and played  a key role in the move that led to  Daniel Sturridge’s equaliser.

And that performance brings this tale full circle. Another must-win World Cup game looms for Hodgson and the plan he will be hatching for Uruguay at the plush Royal Tulip hotel in Rio de Janeiro will again revolve around a flying young winger.

Townsend’s time was in October but the present is about Sterling and there is little doubt he has the talent, tenacity and temperament to cope with whatever Uruguay throw at him and help maintain England’s interest in this tournament.
