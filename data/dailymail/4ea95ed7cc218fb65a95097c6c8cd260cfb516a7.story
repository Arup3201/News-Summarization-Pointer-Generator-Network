Oops! They did it again. Michael Jordan has been sued by yet another woman claiming basketball's greatest-ever player is the father of her baby.

According to TMZ.com, the former Chicago Bulls star is being sued by a Georgia woman who claims Jordan fathered her daughter, born in 2010.

The suit comes just months after a similar case against the basketball legend was tossed out of a Georgia court.

Jordan, now 50, is reported to claim the suit is another case of a desperate woman seeking to leech cash from him.

Acclaimed by the NBA and most fans as the greatest basketball player of all time, Jordan still holds huge earning power and is estimated to make a giant-sized $80 million per year even after quitting the game.

The most-recent suit, filed by Laquetta Theus, alleges she gave birth to Juyana Rachelle Henderson in August 2010. Theus is claiming child support from Jordan.

Theus reportedly wrote on her Facebook profile, 'Michael Jordan, when are you going to support your 2-year-old daughter? You drop 10 million on your nice wedding ... that was nice but don’t you think it time that you support your daughter?'

Jordan beat a similar suit earlier this year filed by another alleged 'baby momma'.

Pamela Smith, who now runs a website selling her skills as a 'loveologist', claimed Jordan fathered her 17-year-old son and demanded cash from the icon.

Smith's Twitter account, using the name 'Evette Smith', claims she is 'America's hottest love expert'.

Jordan denied Smith's charge and his attorneys demanded a DNA test from Smith. Like Theus, the self-proclaimed love-and-sex expert lives in Georgia.

At the time of the case, the ex-Bull called Smith's allegations 'a shameless, bad faith attempt to abuse the legal system.'

The case was dropped after it was discovered public records showed the identity of the father of Smith's son had been confirmed in 2003.

The paternity of the teen was 
'conclusively established' in divorce filings between Smith and her 
ex-husband, Jordan’s attorney told the court at the time.

The judge ordered Smith to pay $9,704 in costs to cover Jordan's legal bills.

Reflecting the Smith case, Jordan has again filed a counter claim against Theus stating little baby Juyana is not his.

Last April, Jordan married long-time girlfriend Yvette Prieto, a 34-year-old Cuban-American model, in a flamboyant ceremony in Palm Beach, Florida.

The wedding is estimated to have cost $10 million with a 300-person star-packed guest list that included golfer Tiger Woods, Jordan's former teammate Scottie Pippen, and movie director Spike Lee.

Music megastars Usher and Robin Thicke performed on the big night.

Jordan, one of the most recognizable athletes in the world, won six NBA championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named by Associated Press only second to baseballer Babe Ruth in their list of the greatest athletes of the 20th century.

Jordan retired from professional basketball in 2003.
