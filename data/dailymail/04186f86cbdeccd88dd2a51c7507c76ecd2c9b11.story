David Cameron has agreed to change his controversial EU referendum blueprint amid fears the original plans could unfairly produce a ‘stay in’ result.

The Prime Minister has bowed to Eurosceptic pressure and revised the crucial ‘in/out’ question to be put to the nation if he wins the next Election.

The alteration will see voters asked if the UK should ‘be’ in the EU, rather than ‘remain’ as in the original wording.

U turn: David Cameron bowed to Eurosceptic pressure and revised the crucial 'in/out' question to be put to the nation if he wins the next Election

The change will be confirmed this week when Tory MP James Wharton publishes a Bill to guarantee Mr Cameron’s promise to hold the referendum by the end of 2017.

In a highly unusual move for a backbench MP’s legislation, the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary William Hague will sponsor the proposals to prove their commitment to a referendum.

Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox, a leading figure of the Tory Right, and ex-Minister Sir Tony Baldry will also put their names to the Bill in a concerted effort to show the party is united on the referendum plan.

Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful 1922 committee of backbench MPs, is also sponsoring the Bill.

Mr Cameron has been blocked from introducing the referendum plan by his pro-Brussels Liberal Democrat Coalition partners.

The Mail on Sunday has learned that as well as throwing his weight behind the Bill, the Prime Minister privately agreed that the referendum question should be changed.

Support: Stockton South MP Mr Wharton said he was pleased to have the Prime Minister's support on his bill. He said he is fighting to put a fair question to the British people

In proposals published last month, voters were asked: ‘Do you think that the UK should remain a member of the EU?’

But
 after anti-Brussels MPs privately protested that the word ‘remain’ 
would prompt voters to stay in, the wording has been changed.

A source said: ‘Instead of “Do you want to remain in the EU” it will simply ask voters if they want to “be” in the EU. It’s a more neutral, fairer question.’

Last night, experts said the change could be crucial.

Damian Lyons Lowe, of pollsters Survation, said: ‘The original question set out last month gave us 51 per cent in favour of leaving the EU and 49 per cent against in a survey.

'That’s a statistical dead-heat. But the rephrasing could tip the balance further in favour of leaving the EU.’

The change has been made even though Mr Cameron  believes that Britain should remain in a reformed EU.

Stockton South MP Mr Wharton said last night: ‘I’m extremely pleased that David Cameron is backing this important Bill, and that we have been able to make the changes we needed to ensure it’s a fair question that we put to the British people.’

Spat: Tory Chairman Grant Shapps (pictured left) said Ed Miliband was 'too weak' to give his MPs s ay after the Labour leader urged his colleagues to abstain from voting

But sources confirmed the wording of any referendum would be vetted by the Electoral Commission before being put to the people.

Tory MPs see legislating now for a post-election referendum as a vital sign to voters that Mr Cameron will keep his word if he is re-elected.

However, with both the Lib Dems and Labour opposed to Mr Wharton’s proposals, the Bill is unlikely to become law even it clears its initial Commons hurdle.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has urged his MPs not to take part in the first vote on the referendum plans due next month, with party sources dismissing the Bill as a ‘gimmick’.

That sparked accusations from Tory chairman Grant Shapps that Mr Miliband was ‘too weak’ to give his MPs, let alone the public, a say.
