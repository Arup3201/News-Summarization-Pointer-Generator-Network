It is years since he was in charge of the party, but Paddy Ashdown took the lead as the Lib Dems enjoyed their conference singalong.

With a beer in hand, the Lib Dem grandee joined members as they sang songs taking a pop at their party’s ‘crazy’ ministers and ‘hazy’ policies.

Hundreds of ministers, MPs and activists performed the adaptations of songs by Oasis, Sting and the Beatles in a ballroom at the conference hotel in Glasgow.

Lord Ashdown led the singing of a version of ‘We Shall Overcome’ alongside a cardboard cut-out of Nick Clegg, before performing a short stand-up routine, which included a story he said was ‘about as accurate as our manifesto’.

Despite the ongoing airstrikes in Iraq, members enthusiastically performed the Iraqi Cokey, a revised version of the Hokey Cokey with the lyrics: ‘You put your Clare Short in, your Clare Short out.

‘You do Iraqi Cokey and you turn about, that’s what it’s all about.’

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander was mocked in a version of the song Danny Boy.

The members sang: ‘So why don’t you just this once show you’re a Liberal, Show there is passion and some principles you share?

‘But no, instead, you sound robotically a Tory, And all the people see is that semi-vacant stare.’

Another song performed at the Glee Club, which has become an annual tradition on the final night of the party’s conference, included: ‘Tony Blair can f**k off and die.’

Former leader Charles Kennedy, who is a recovering alcoholic, was laughed at in a version of the Skye Boat Song. The lyrics read: ‘Where is the man? Down in the bar, Loudly the Whips pro clai-aim.

‘Out on the town, Out of his head, Charlie is p****d again.’

Birmingham Yardley MP John Hemming led the singing on the keyboard, while MPs including communities minister Stephen Williams and Julian Huppert took to the stage.

The ‘Liberator Song Book’, on sale for £4, included a song penned by Dr Huppert attacking the ‘surveillance state’ to the tune of Police’s Every Step You Take.
