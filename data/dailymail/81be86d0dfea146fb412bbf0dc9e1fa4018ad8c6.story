The former director of dinosaur replicas at the Natural History Museum has claimed his  wife is keeping him prisoner in a garage at their Hamptons mansion as she waits for him to die.

Martin Cassidy, 84, made the claims in his pending divorce case from 62-year-old paper heiress Kate Wallach, whom he married 28 years ago, the New York Post reported.

He claims she is waiting for him to die so she can avoid a divorce payout.

'I am a literal and figurative prisoner of my wife,' he said in the affidavit.

Wife and mother: Mrs Wallach-Cassidy, seen last week with her son, Camaron, believes her husband of 28 years may be suffering from dementia 

Cassidy claims that he only has a small bed, two flimsy folding chairs and a nail to hang his clothes on in the 30-by-40-foot room, and that maids bring him small cans of soup to eat. 

Meanwhile, his wife lives in luxury at their $20million estate, he claims.

'I have been relegated by the defendant to a small room on the property, in a far corner of this huge house, and to small bathroom with no bathtub or shower,' Cassidy said, the Post reported.

Instead, he must rely on staff to give him the occasional sponge bath, he said.   

Wallach, a mother of five, owns a 20 per cent interest in her family's paper-distribution company Central National-Gottesman, and is worth more than $200million, court papers say. She inherited the share from her father, successful businessman and noted philanthropist Ira Wallach, who passed away in 2007 at age 97.

Cassidy signed a pre-nuptial agreement that cut him out of her fortune ahead of their wedding nearly three decades ago.

But Cassidy said he didn't realize what he was signing and only did so because Wallach said it would make her parents happier.

He is now calling on the court to overturn the agreement. He also wants more than $30,000 a month from his wife, who now gives him an allowance of $2,500 a month.

However, Wallach denies cutting Cassidy out of her life and believes he is developing dementia, according to her lawyer, the New York Post reported.  

Her lawyer Kenneth Weinstein said that she doesn't even want to divorce him, and that her husband lives in luxurious conditions.

A court-appointed guardian is looking into whether Cassidy is mentally fit, and a judge will receive a finding next month. During that time, Cassidy will remain at the property.

But his lawyer has appealed the order and said Cassidy would prefer to stay at a rental home in Amagansett. 

So far, the guardian has found Cassidy's living conditions to be, 'not, by any stretch of the imagination, luxurious.' 

Cassidy, who was 56 when he married his wife, previously worked as a laboratory assistant at the Natural History Museum before he began manufacturing dinosaur reproductions there, according to a 1983 New York Times article. Papers on his work have appeared in The Museum Journal.
