The first batch of 60,000 tickets for Froch v Groves II sold out inside an hour of going on sale and Wembley is heading for the biggest crowd in British boxing history.

Promoter Eddie Hearn is seeking talks with Transport for London for approval to market a further 20,000 seats before the world super middleweight fight takes place on May 31.

The minor quibble over an earlier first bell time to help with a late night exit from the stadium is not likely to prevent Carl Froch and George Groves surpassing the 70,000 attendance for the heavyweight bout between Jack Doyle and Jack Petersen in 1933.

What Hearn is describing as the 
biggest ever fight in this country has already outsold the 57,000 for 
Ricky Hatton’s fight with Juan Lazcano at his beloved Manchester City’s 
ground in 2008.

Hearn’s 
gamble in going for Wembley, even though England play a pre-World Cup 
game against Peru the night before, paid off at a rate of one thousand 
tickets per minute.

During the press conference, Froch
 and Groves did not need to repeat the mutual abuse and insults which 
preceded the controversial clash last November in order to shift the 
tickets as they appeared on Sky Television.

Froch was calm and 
composed, Groves more respectful… although both cited their view of the 
initial meeting as cast iron reason why they will win.

But during a photocall on the side of the
 Wembley pitch there was a heated exchange as Froch pushed Groves in the
 chest as the pair squared up for the photographers.

Groves is expecting a three round stoppage in a fight to equal the Leonard-Hearns classic. Froch insists he will win again inside the distance, this time without an inconclusive, premature stoppage.

Groves'
 belief that he was robbed by the ninth round in Manchester by referee 
Howard Foster has lead him to insist on foreign referee and judges this 
time.

Both men denied hating
 each other despite the acrimony that has gone on before, but Froch 
refused to take part in the traditional stare down.

'It was a stonewall robbery first time, everyone knows it, and that's why I've requested neutral officials,' said Groves.

'It's conditional on the fight going ahead.

'I don't believe in fate, but I do believe in everything happening for a reason.

'Maybe I had to go through that decision, that first fight, to get to the point where I can fight at Wembley, in my home city, in front of my home fans.

'I couldn't be more excited about this fight now.

'The first fight we went in believing: now we go in knowing.

'More importantly Froch knows. Apart from the gift in the ninth round last time out, he's got nothing. He's absolutely spent.'

Nottingham-based Froch conceded he took Groves too lightly in their first meeting, but was not prepared to delve into the detail surrounding his victory.

'Everyone's entitled to their opinion on that fight,' said Froch.

'But what I think about the stoppage is totally irrelevant.

'All I know is that it was controversial, and that's why we're here.

'There's going to be no question-marks this time around.

'It doesn't get any bigger than this.

'The platform to showcase my skills, I'm just so, so excited.

'To be given this opportunity, it's wonderful and we must take it with both hands.

'I'm excited this opportunity has come along at this time.

'To
 fight in an outdoor event of this magnitude, the last time I can 
remember anything like this was Ricky Hatton at Manchester City's 
ground.

Fingers crossed: Groves is hoping for a different outcome in the re-match

All smiles: Froch looks relaxed at the press conference

'I can remember looking over my shoulder, just seeing a carpet of people, and thinking 'this is amazing'.

'I didn't think I'd get an opportunity like this, so it's extremely humbling.'

Groves' trainer Paddy Fitzpatrick revealed he has written to the BBBofC, asking them to confirm Froch's fitness to box.

Unfazed 36-year-old Froch admitted he is yet to undertake his routine annual medical, but did not expect any complications.

'Actually I've got to go through my medicals, so I can't officially answer that yet,' he said.

'We have an annual medical, we have a brain scan and we know what we've got to do.

'You don't want to tempt fate, and you don't want to talk about what can be a dark side of boxing.

'I'm fit, sharp and ready, there won't be any question marks come May 31.'
