A Jewish faith school has been fined after it was found trying to squeeze 120 pupils into a terrace house for lessons.

The girls were being taught in ‘cramped’ conditions at Bnois Jerusalem School, which was using a three-storey house as extra classrooms.

Concerns were first raised in 2006 but lessons were still taking place in the inappropriate conditions this year despite neighbours complaining about noise and the local council issuing an enforcement notice.

Row: Bnois Jerusalem Girls School was using the three-storey house on the left for five years without planning permission after it ran out of room in its schoolhouse on the right

The owner of the house, Amhurst Park Holdings Ltd, has now been fined £6,000 after admitting breaches of planning notices.

Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that 
the school for Orthodox Jews in Stamford Hill, North London, had grown 
too large to accommodate its 650 pupils and ‘spilled over into the house
 next door’, which it was allowed to use rent-free by Amhurst Park 
Holdings, which is a not-for-profit company.

Judge Stephen Dawson, QC, said: ‘They
 are not complying with the rules and, though planning can be a 
nuisance, if we did not have planning rules we would have mayhem.

‘I am told it is going to stop and, 
though I can see the reason for breaching the enforcement notice, all 
schools must make compromises.’

Case: Bnois Jerusalem Girls School sparked noise complaints from neighbours after using a terraced house to educate up to 120 students, Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, heard

The voluntary-aided school was founded
 in 1965. Pupils aged three to 16 come from Yiddish-speaking homes and 
speak English as a second language.

Ellis Sareen, prosecuting, told the 
court there was permission for the ground floor to be used as a business
 but not the upper two floors.

Hackney Council served an enforcement notice on the owner in 2011 but an inspection last year found nothing had changed.

A school spokesman said yesterday: ‘We
 did very well at the last Ofsted inspection. The accommodation and 
education were all fine and we were rated good. I have no idea what will
 happen with the students now.’
