Poundland founder Steve Smith spared no expense renovating his 13-bedroom family mansion.

So he had even more reason to get a good deal when he put it on the market with a hefty price tag of £6.5million.

Always in search of a bargain, the 52-year-old multimillionaire decided to use his own online estate agency, EstatesDirect.com, to list the property.

Now Mr Smith has avoided paying commission and saved himself more than £115,000 in fees.

For sale: Poundland founder Steve Smith is selling his 13-bedroom family mansion near Bridgnorth, Staffordshire, for £6.5million and has listed it online to save £115,000 in estate agent fees

Luxury: The sprawling property, which Mr Smith and wife Tracy spent seven years renovating, boasts its own indoor pool

Room for a swift half: The house also has a pub, complete with a fully-stocked bar, meaning a trip to the local is just a few steps away

Mr Smith, 52, says he and wife Tracy have decided to downsize now that their three children are flying the nest.

He said: 'I've always looked for value for money in everything I do.

'If [a high street estate agent] sold my house for £6.5million at 1.5 per cent plus VAT, I'd have to hand over £117,000, which is staggering considering how little they do.

'Doing it online costs me a total of £1,788, so I'll save £115,212.

Sales technique: Mr Smith says he has 'always looked for value for money', and believes that selling property online is 'the future'

'It is the future of property selling so no wonder the high street estate agents hate us.'

Mr Smith realised he had the entrepreneurial spirit from an early age. He recalls sitting on his father's market stall aged two, and opened his first discount store aged 16, selling items with damaged packaging for 10p a pop.

He set up Poundland with a single shop in Burton upon Trent in 1990, and the business has gone on from strength to strength ever since.

It now has 500 stores in the UK – more than double the number it had five years ago – selling everything from toys to toiletries, stationery to shampoo and bread to biscuits – all for the same price.

Mr Smith sold his share in the business in 2002, making himself a £50million fortune.

Design: The property was originally designed by Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis, who famously created the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales, but Mr Smith has put his own spin on it

Labour of love: Mr Smith said he spared no expense on refurbishing his home, and it 'will be a real wrench' for the family to leave

It helped him buy Hammer Hill House, a sprawling mansion near Bridgnorth, Shropshire, 14 years ago.

The property was originally designed by Sir Bertram Clough Williams-Ellis, who famously created the Italianate village of Portmeirion in North Wales. But after Mr Smith moved in, he soon started to put his own spin on it.

Now the mansion boasts its own indoor swimming pool and snooker room, all set in almost 30 acres of rolling countryside.

Mr Smith said: 'The house is very special to us and it will be a real wrench for us to leave,' he said.

'We began refurbishing the home in 2000 and finally finished it in 2007. It was a real labour of love and no expense was spared. I especially love our home pub with a fully stocked bar. It's really unique and we've had some great parties there.'

Mr Smith's story is being filmed by the BBC for a new series of Poundshop wars to be shown early next year.

'I'm really hooked on selling pound products even though I sold Poundland many years ago,' Mr Smith, who has now taken the business online with Poundshop.com, said.

'Buying online is great for time pressed people and we are expanding our ranges daily.

'We soon hope to be selling everything from sexy lingerie to dog food at knockdown prices.

'After all everyone loves a bargain don't they?'
