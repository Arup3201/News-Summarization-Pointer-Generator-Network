A pizza boy who raped a woman on the Upper West Side 'because he was horny' as her seven-year-old daughter slept beside her will spend 13 years in prison.

Cesar Lucas, 18,described by some as 'showing no remorse' admitted to sneaking into Kia Walker's apartment in September of 2012 after delivering pizza to an apartment on the same floor but tried to claim she was 'very drunk.'

Lucas also stole an iPhone and $20 from Graves' 7-year-old daughter's wallet on his way out.

Cesar Lucas, 18, who raped a woman as she slept in bed with her child will serve 13 years behind bars

'Your honor, he has violated me​​ and my family. He turned my life around,' Kia Graves - who has waived her anonymity and spoken to the media - told Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber, as convicted rapist Cesar Lucas kept a stoic expression.

Graves held back tears as she addressed her teenage rapist in the courtroom.

'They say time heals everything but I’m still waiting. I’m not ready to make nice and I’m not ready to back down. I’m still angry, sad and hurt, your honor,' Graves said, reading from a notebook. 

'He deserves everything the court is sentencing him to today.'

Lucas was only 16 when he raped Graves, and two years later when he was addressed in the court room by a judge who asked him if he had anything to say he said, 'no thank you.'

The New York Post reported that Lucas also handed in a written confession that claimed Graves was 'drunk' at the time of the attack.

It also stated he felt 'this type of feelings he had never felted before which led him to do things he would never think he would do in his life.'

'I unrap her from all the coushing she had on top of her . . . She also started to feel horny, you can say,' his poorly written statement said.

'She was completely drunk. I really was pretty scare because she was drunk and I kind ah took advantage of her,' the letter continued.

Even though Lucas failed to claim responsibility for his actions and instead claims the victim 'wanted it,' his lawyer Gary Villanueva says Lucas is a good kid.

'He’s a remorseful young man from a caring, decent and solid family,' said Villanueva.

Graves says she wants to move on with her life but that it will be very difficult.

'I feel sorry for him, but I must forgive him to move on with my life. Thank you,' she said.

'To forgive sounds good. To forget — I’m not sure I could.'

Kia Graves spoke up in january of this year and revealed that her life has been utterly turned upside down since the night Lucas slipped into her apartment and had his way with her while out on a run for his father's 10th Avenue pizza restaurant.

'I have nightmares thinking that he’s getting out of jail, and I wake up all the time making sure my door is locked,' said the shell-shocked mom.

Unfortunately, her door was not locked that September night.

Cesar Lucas was working as a delivery 
boy at Sal’s Pizza in the same Manhattan 
neighborhood as the woman’s luxury apartment building.

Cesar Lucas, 18, claimed Graves was 'very drunk' when he raped her and he attributed his actions in a poorly written confession to his 'disea'

He was delivering a pizza to the next-door flat when he noticed that the door was slightly ajar and allegedly entered the apartment.

Graves, a former actress turned model agency employee, had gone to bed with her daughter an hour and a half before the alleged incident.

It was the last time Grave says she's had a normal night's sleep.

'I sleep with one eye open, basically,' she told the New York Daily News. 'I have panic attacks and I wake up in sweats.'

Graves no longer works and lives each day crippled by her memories of the attack.

'I don’t know what to do,' she said. 'I’m just seeing my doctor and hoping for the best.'

In addition to her professional life, Graves said her social life has been left in shambles.

'I
 used to go out sometimes after work,' she told the Daily News. 'We used
 to have parties or go out. I used to date. I wasn’t a social butterfly,
 but I had a normal social life, definitely.'

Convicted: Pizza delivery boy Cesar Lucas, who was 16 at the time, has pleaded not guilty to rape in court but confessed to 'sexual intercorse' with the 35-year-old in a handwritten note released by police

Graves still lives in the apartment where she was raped--a building in which she grew up and where her mother also lives to this day--and her deepest fear is that her attacker, who knows where she lives, will somehow come to find her.

'I’m scared that my rapist will get out of jail and he knows where I live,' she said. 'There’s constant fear and anxiety.'

Meanwhile, Graves is suing the night doorman who was there the evening of the attack and was subsequently fired.

She's also suing Sal's Pizza, her condo building and management company.

Lucas described a type of 'disea' which made him enter the victim’s flat after midnight on September 29, 2012.

Disturbing: The then 16-year-old was on a delivery for his father's restaurant Sal's Pizza on Manhattan's West Side. He'd been charged with breaking into apartments before

‘I screamed,’ the Graves told the Daily News at the time.

‘It took him about 30 seconds. I said, “Get off of me,” and I pushed him. He said “I’m sorry,” and ran out,’ she said.

Lucas
 was picked up by police at Sal's Pizza a short time later and charged 
with rape and burglary. He allegedly told police he was 'feeling horny'.

‘Cesar
 got type of disease in a way he never had felted before,’ the poorly 
written note reads.

Continuing
 to refer to himself in the third person, Lucas Cesar then describes the
 sexual assault, claiming he had sexual intercourse with her for two 
minutes before leaving the apartment – but not before rummaging through 
her daughter’s purse and stealing $20, according to the New York Post.

Upon his arrest, Cesar Lucas initially denied raping the woman, but admitted he had broken into the flat

‘What's going on? Why are you arresting me? I've been arrested before for the same thing. I broke into an apartment. It's still pending. I have to go to court,’ he said according to police statements released to the New York Post.

Lucas was referring to his arrest in August for breaking into a 39-year-old woman's apartment while making a delivery and stealing her wallet.

He was charged with burglary, criminal possession of stolen credit cards and theft of service, to which he has pleaded not guilty

Lucas was taken into custody on September 29 where he eventually made the horrific and grammatically appalling confession to rape.

He put all the blame on his ‘disea’, adding in the note that ‘Cesar didn't realized what kind of things he was about to do or make.’
