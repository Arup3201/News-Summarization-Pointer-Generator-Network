Stuart Lancaster expects England's QBE International against Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday week to go ahead as planned despite the threat of strike action by the tourists.

The International Rugby Board announced on Wednesday that Samoa's players had warned they may boycott the game over concerns surrounding administration of the Samoa Rugby Union.

However, England head coach Lancaster believes the penultimate game of England's autumn campaign will go ahead.

'I was aware of this a couple of weeks ago, but my understanding is that it has all been resolved. This is something that was potentially an issue,' Lancaster said.

The IRB had confirmed there had been 'an indication' that Samoa's players would withdraw from next week's clash, but is hopeful the matter will be resolved.

He added: 'We engaged in dialogue with the Samoa Rugby Union and the International Rugby Players' Association to facilitate urgent and collaborative resolution.

'With all parties, including the players, committed to ongoing dialogue, just under two weeks ago the players withdrew their proposed action to withdraw from the England match, and the IRB fully expects the Union to undertake its obligation to honour its November Test programme commitment in full.' 

The Samoa players are currently in France preparing for Friday night's appointment with Canada.
