Revellers who urinate in public in the Czech Republic face being named and shamed around the world - after a businessman threatened to post their antics on YouTube.

This picture, which was posted to Twitter and has quickly gone viral, shows men what they can expect if they decide to baptise the streets with their own holy water.

Beneath the illustration of a stick man spraying the ground has been added an extra message in the universal language of pictograms - threatening to video-record the act and publish the clip on YouTube.

Innovative: A sign in the universal language of pictograms issues an innovative threat to men who wee in public

Marek Sotak posted the image to Twitter last week after finding it on a Czech-language discussion forum, and it has been retweeted more than 5,000 times and chosen as a 'favourite' by more than 3,000 users.

The sign is in Mikulov, a wine-making tourist town sitting on the southern border of the Czech Republic and Austria. 

 The three-stage pictographic message presents a stark message to anyone thinking of relieving themselves away from designated (preferably plumbed-in) areas.

Whip out the old fella and start to spray, it warns, and your act will be caught on closed-circuit television camera.

This footage will then be taken and uploaded to YouTube for the world's amusement.

Mr Sotak's Tweet suggests that the approach is typically Czech. He writes: 'In Czech Republic, this is how you threat people (sic), so they don't to bad things...'

The innovative deterrent has caught the imagination of people across the world, with news websites from London to Boston reporting it and calling for the policy to be adopted in their own home towns.

Beautiful: Marek Sotak says the sign was put up by an irate hotelier in Mikulov, pictured, Czech Republic

But responding to a Tweet from MailOnline, Mr Sotak admitted the initiative was not official public policy in Mikulov.

Asked if the sign was genuine, he responded: 'Yes it is, but it is not the government who put that up, an upset hotel owner did.'

iDNES.cz quotes Petr Marcinčák, the hotelier in question, as saying: 'If I wanted to, I could argue with someone every day [about peeing against his walls], so I came up with the warning.'

No videos have yet emerged on YouTube of people peeing outside Hotel Marcinčák, But Mr Sotak added that he thought the hotelier was willing to carry through on the threat. 

'I think the owner meant it. It was not a joke,' he said.
