If weeping over a stationary bike sounds like every time you attempt a spinning class, the latest trend in fitness might confuse you somewhat.

SoulCycle, which starting in New York, has gained an impressive list of celebrity followers which includes Tom Cruise, Lady Gaga, the entire Beckham clan and Katy Perry, and is now heading across the pond.

It essentially is a mixture of the hard-core aerobic workouts sent to ear-splitting loud chart tunes –making the class seem more like a club than gym- and a therapy session.

SoulCylcle’s hyper-intensive formula which has been inspiring exercise fanatics since 2006 with party atmosphere classes that fuse mind and body into a heart-pumping, addictive workout routine.

The instructor will talk you through emotions such as sadness and anger in between adjusting the pace and incline of your workout, a formula which reportedly sees people crying over their bikes on a regular basis.

The fitness fad is set to come to London within the next year, and the classes – which take up to sixty students- are certain to book up fast as the capital's lycra-clad elite are wooed by SoulCycle’s heady promise of combined workout and therapy session.

Speaking to the Observer, SoulCycle’s marketing director said: ‘We’re planning on London in the next year, We really try to have more than one studio when we open.’

The classes have reached a crazed level of devotion in recent years as stars like Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Jake Gyllenhaal and Charlize Theron regularly pop in to the New York and LA studios.

Super model Karlie Kloss, who works out four to five times a week, fuels her body with green juices, admitted last year that SoulCycle was a challenge for her and that her instructor even berates her in front of the class for it.

The Chicago-born model, who credits her famous SoulCycle instructor Akin for really 'pushing' her, and told Style.com: ‘I always tend to be one beat off of the rest of the class and the instructor usually calls me out on it in front of everyone.’

It is testimonials like this that have seen the classes take on a cult-like status Stateside, which is likely to be mirrored when it reaches the UK.

There is now even classes aimed specifically at teenagers running for New York’s monied Upper East Siders.

SoulCycle spin sessions have become a hit among young girls in the area who attend the studio's SoulTeen classes that cater specifically to the 11-18 age group.

The classes come at a premium though. While adult SoulCycle classes cost $34 each, teenagers (or at least their parents) must spend $40 a head.

However, not everyone is a fan of SoulCycle.

Celebrity trainer Tracey Anderson famously hit out at the movement, claiming the classes would make people’s legs bulky.

In December 2012, Ms Anderson told the New York Times that the chain is overrated, saying: 'I can get you better legs than them.'

She also claimed that the former employee of hers who started SoulCycle did it by stealing one of her inventions.

'It makes me sad for humanity, actually, that people would take all my hard work and then pose like they have a method that they have tried and tested,' she said.
