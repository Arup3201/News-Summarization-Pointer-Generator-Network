It's a Sunday evening TV treat that has warmed the cockles of the nation's heart but for the young stars of Call the Midwife, their spell in the limelight is an all too brief experience.

The makers of the BBC smash hit show have revealed that the newborn babies who appear on the show have a career that lasts just three days because of the corporation's extensive health and safety rules.

According to lead writer, Heidi Thomas, babies used on screen have to be less than 10 days old because older children don't have the 'scrunched-up' look of a newborn.

But thanks to the BBC's ponderous health and safety system, the first week of each tiny star's life is taken up with form filling - leaving programme makers with a window of just three days to capture the newborn look before it fades.

'We have someone who books the ladies while they're still pregnant because once the babies have got past 10 days old, they lose that scrunched-up look,' Thomas revealed in an interview with the Radio Times.

Although the babies are 'booked' before they even make it into the world, the extensive paperwork can occasionally take so long, producers are forced to disguise older children with swathes of blankets.

Luckily for the makers of the hit show, there's no shortage of new babies looking for a share of the applause.

According to Thomas, the show has become so popular, expectant mothers routinely volunteer their offspring.

Unlike the rest of the cast, however, the young stars don't have to sit through hours in the make-up chair.

'In episode four of the new series, we have a baby born with spinal bifida [a nervous disease that affects the vertebrae] so we used CGI to paint a lesion, a flesh wound on its back.

'You can't submit a newborn baby to complicated make-up jobs so it really does make our lives easier.'
