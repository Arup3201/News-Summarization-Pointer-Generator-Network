Just 24 hours earlier she was walking down the aisle in front of gushing friends and relatives.

But for Jennifer Grant - wedded bliss soon turned to sheer terror after a spontaneous bodyboarding session left her swimming for her life as fierce currents threatened to drag her out to sea.

The newly-wed, 30, and her husband, Warren, were caught in a dangerous rip current off Porth Beach, Cornwall yesterday and Mrs Grant had to be rescued by lifeboats while clinging to a rock.

For an almost an hour, she lay trapped on top of the slippery surface while waves thrashed over it - sweeping away her husband and a friend who had also been taking refuge in the same spot.

Despite being tossed violently against the rocks by powerful waves and having to hurl herself into a rescue boat - she suffered only shock and scratches in the 'terrifying' ordeal.

The couple from Ottery St Mary, Devon, were married at the Sands Hotel on Saturday and wanted to make the most of the beach hire facilities before they returned home.

Mrs Grant, a dental nurse, and Mr Grant, 41, a production manager, were in the water with friends Mitch Seward and Scott Ward.

They had been in the sea for around 45 minutes before getting caught in a rip current.

Mrs Grant said: 'The sea wasn't rough - it was a little choppy when we went in. Then Warren got caught in a rip and dragged towards rocks.

Bliss: The couple had enjoyed a 'perfect wedding' the day before and decided to make the most of the Cornish beach before heading back home to Devon

'I watched him climb on to the rock then I tried to get back to shore. But I couldn't get in and realised Mitch and I were caught in the rip and being dragged to the rock too.

'I was going to climb on to it when a wave smashed me into it and cut me up. 

'We managed to get on to the rock with Warren but the tide was coming in and a wave then came and swept Warren away in to the sea.

'It was white water at the foot foot of the sheer drop he had been swept off - but luckily he managed to get back to shore.

Today Mrs Grant said: 'We were just so lucky - it could have been so much worse'

The couple's friend, Mr Seward, was also swept from the rock and waited in the water in case Mrs Grant decided to jump in.

But she insisted he save himself and head back to the shore while he still had the energy to swim. 

She added: 'By this time the tide was coming in and the waves were crashing over the rock I was on. I was terrified but Warren had always told me not to panic.

'Everybody on the beach thought I was going to jump in but I wasn't going to do that. I'd been there half-an-hour and the waves were washing right over the rock by this time.

The dental nurse added: 'It was definitely a strange day after such a special perfect wedding'

She escaped without injury but was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro to be treated for shock

'Scott had climbed on the cliff behind the rock and was shouting to me "stay where you are".

'All of a sudden I heard a helicopter and thought it was coming to me but it flew over and kept going. It turned out there was another rescue going on nearby.'

The rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose in Helston had been called out to winch two men to safety after they became stranded on the nearby Barrowfields beach and sand dunes area. 

Mrs Grant added: 'I was right at the back of the rock by this time as far away from the waves as I could get.

24 hours earlier: On Saturday the 30-year-old married Warren Grant in a beautful ceremony at the Sands Hotel

Scene of serenity: The newly-wed has thanked the RNLI for saving her life just one day after her wedding

'Then I saw the rescue boat arriving and a lifeguard jumped in with a life-jacket. He led me down to the boat which was struggling against the waves and told me to jump.

'But it was so scary. I managed to jump but I landed badly on the boat - thankfully the crew managed to catch me and haul me in.

'They took me back to shore where I had a check up in the ambulance. Thankfully I just had a few cuts and scratches.

'We were just so lucky - it could have been so much worse. It was definitely a strange day after such a special perfect wedding.'

She expressed her gratitude to the RNLI for saving her and is now preparing to jet off to Egypt next week for her honeymoon. 

A spokeswoman for the RNLI said: 'The newlywed bride had been taking a post wedding surf at Porth beach when she got into difficulties.

'She had managed to scramble onto the rocks on Porth Island but was unable to make her way back to shore.'
