A jealous boyfriend today admitted stabbing a mother-of-three to death on Christmas Eve before going out for a pint and a pizza.

Charmaine Macmuiris, 37, had been with David O’Sullivan, 28, for just three weeks before he attacked her in a jealous rage and stabbed her 10 times with a kitchen knife.

Ms Macmuiris was found dead at O’Sullivan’s flat in Carmarthen, west Wales, on Christmas Day.

David O'Sullivan was sentenced to life in prison for stabbing Charmaine Macmuiris to death in a jealous rage. He then went and bought a pizza and beer while the mother-of-three lay bleeding to death

He was today jailed for life at Swansea Crown Court and sentenced to a minimum term of 14 years after changing his plea to guilty moments before he was due to stand trial.

Ms Macmuiris's mother Christine said her daughter had been taken in 'the most cruellest of ways on the most cruellest of days'.

She had been due to wrap presents with her family but was persuaded to meet bricklayer O'Sullivan.

The pair fought at the pub and O'Sullivan threw a pint of lager over Ms Macmuiris.

Ms Macmuiris's family said she was looking forward to celebrating Christmas with her three children Hannah, 20, Ruby, 15, and Keilan, 12, and toddler granddaughter Pixie.

Her mother said in a victim impact statement: 'Charmaine has been robbed of her life.

'She was a much loved mother, daughter, sister and auntie and we have been devastated by her loss and the shocking manner of her death.'

Patrick Harrington QC said after the brutal attack, O'Sullivan went to buy some alcohol and food.

He said: 'After, he left the home and went to two pubs and 
drank larger and bought a pizza - he returned to the address of the 
murder and ate his pizza.

Ms Macmuiris was discovered at O'Sullivan's home in Maes yr Ysgol, Carmarthen, on Christmas Day

'It is only when his parents arrived on Christmas day that police were called.'

The court heard O'Sullivan mistakenly believed his girlfriend was seeing another man.

He sent threatening text messages to the man and his family on the night of the murder.

He persuaded the mother-of-three to come back to his flat before murdering her.

Police officers came to house after hearing reports of a disturbance but O’Sullivan told them 'everything was OK'.

O’Sullivan was confronted by police officers as Charmaine lay bleeding to death in his house.

Mr
Harrington QC told the court: 'When police officers asked him
about cuts to his arm he said he had punched a hole in the wall.

'A 
little later he was seen standing outside his home by neighbours, he 
said he and his girlfriend had argued and he had hit her and she was 
lying on the bed.

'But he had not merely hit her, he had stabbed her to death.'

Prosecutors said he punched Ms Macmuiris in the face in the lounge before stabbing her to death in the bedroom.

Charmaine Macmuiris's family said she was taken 'in the cruellest of ways on the cruellest of days'

Mr Harrington QC said: 'Even before that time he showed himself to be possessive and jealous towards her.'

Ms MacMuiris' family said his 14 year sentence was not long enough.

They said in a statement: 'As a family we would like to thank friends, neighbours, and Dyfed Powys Police for all their help and support that has been provided throughout this difficult time.

'We are glad that O’Sullivan has been sentenced and we were spared a trial. However we do not feel that a minimum term of 14 years reflects the severity of what he has done. We are all still devastated at losing Charmaine.'

Judge Eleri Rees told Harrington while sentencing him: 'This was a vicious and brutal killing.

'There may have been more than one assault - there is physical evidence of a struggle with blood stains in a variety of locations.

'You used a kitchen knife to attack Charmaine and death would not have been instantaneous or the result of any one wound or blow.

'At some point her daughter tried to text her mother and you tried to respond but in a clumsy mistake you sent a text to another person.

'This was the most callous behaviour to show to someone who you purported to love.'

Speaking after the case Ed Beltrami, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, Wales, said: 'David O’Sullivan finally admitted his responsibility for a senseless and brutal assault that led to the tragic death of Charmaine Macmuiris.

'Only O’Sullivan himself can truly know what caused him to carry out such a vicious attack on an entirely innocent victim.

'What is certain is that those close to Charmaine continue to deal with the truly awful consequences of what he did.'
