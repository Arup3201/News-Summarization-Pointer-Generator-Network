An Alaska serial killer buried three victims in Washington state and submerged two others in a lake but refused to provide more details as to their whereabouts, according to interviews released on Tuesday by the FBI.

Israel Keyes, who committed suicide in his Anchorage jail cell last year, is now believed to have killed 11 people.

The FBI posted more than six hours of videotaped interviews online that agents, Anchorage police and federal prosecutors conducted with Israel Keyes in the months before he killed himself.

Chilling record: Six hours of videotaped interviews with Israel Keyes were released this week months before the serial killer's suicide in an Anchorage jail

In a November 29 interview, just three days before he committed suicide in his jail cell with a razor blade, Keyes asked if investigators had found any knives at his New York property or on a boat he owned in Washington state.

He said there were two knives missing from his girlfriend's home in Anchorage, and he didn't know where they were.

He was particularly concerned about a Cold Steel Tanto - 4 1/2-inch folding knife he bought in Port Angeles, Washington.

Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Feldis why the knife was important, Keyes indicated authorities might find something if they took it apart. Authorities asked if it was blood?

'Well, there might, not on it, maybe inside somewhere,' Keyes replied.

He said, 'yeah,' when asked if the knife was associated with one of the Washington killings.

FBI Special Agent Jolene Goeden probed deeper, asking if a body were found at the bottom of a lake, would it still be intact.

'Were they contained in something or were they just tied to the milk jugs?' she asked.

'No,' he responded.

Goeden asked: 'I mean, is it something where we, we might possible actually still get an intact ...'

'No,' Keyes repeated, cutting her off.

He later indicated the folding blade wasn't the primary means of death. Asked if the victims were shot or strangled, Keyes replied after chuckling: 'You'll get the whole story eventually.'

He then relented and said the only victim shot was Bill Currier in Vermont. All others were strangled except one Washington victim, who was hit in the head and killed as Keyes tried to subdue him.

Feldis and another assistant U.S. attorney, Frank Russo, decided in the taped interview that the Washington state couple were buried in a hole and not submerged in the lake.

Keyes replied: 'Yeah, that was a while ago.'

Keyes worked for the Makah Indian tribe in Washington state after he got out of the Army in July 2001.

'It wasn't that long that you, um, killed somebody and it was that sort of feeling that you needed ... ' Feldis said.

'Yeah, Neah Bay's a boring town,' Keyes replied.

Later, the questioning turned to the bodies in the lake, and Keyes seemingly chastised his interrogators about not figuring out one of the locations.

'You guys know about Lake Crescent in Washington, right?' he said.

Feldis asked: 'And that's the lake?'

'That's one of the lakes,' Keyes replied.

Keyes indicated he weighed the body or bodies down with four to five milk jugs.

'Just for one body,' Feldis asked.

'Yeah,' Keyes said.

The FBI believes one victim was killed in Neah Bay shortly after Keyes was released from the Army.

The other two people buried in Washington state are believed to have been killed from July 2001 to 2005. The other two victims in the state were believed to have been killed in 2005 or 2006.

After his arrests in 2012, Keyes was charged with the murder of 17-year-old Samantha Koenig, an Anchorage barista who was kidnapped from the coffee stand where she worked. Her dismembered body was pulled from a lake north of Anchorage two months after she went missing.

Keyes later confessed to the 2011 murders of Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont, and indicated to authorities there were victims in a total of 10 states.

Keyes never disclosed much information about the other crimes, trying to keep as many details as possible out of the media so his daughter wouldn't be able to find any information up on the Internet or his mother wouldn't have a heart attack reading what he did.

He was in constant negotiations with investigators, oftentimes frustrating them on not releasing information as he said he would.

Officials released the updated 
timeline of travels and crimes involving Keyes this week, which sheds new light on a 
case that left a trail of unsolved killings across the U.S.

The material shows Keyes' movements across the country before his arrest in Texas on March 13, 2012.

However, investigators have had leads run dry on a number of other victims and are seeking the public's help.

FBI
spokesman Eric Gonzalez said they hope the information will help 
identify victims who remain unknown and provide some closure to their 
families.

'We've exhausted all our investigative leads,' Gonzalez said.

The FBI documents said Keyes frequented prostitutes during his travels and killed an unidentified couple in Washington state sometime between July 2001 and 2005.

Bill and Lorraine Currier were the only other people Keyes specifically admitted to murdering

Keyes told investigators that only 
one other body - other than Koenig - had ever been recovered but that 
victim's death was ruled as accidental. The bodies of the Curriers were 
never found.

The FBI said Keyes admitted frequenting prostitutes, but it's unknown if Keyes met any of his victims this way.

Officials said Keyes told them he robbed several banks to fund his travels along with money he made as a general contractor.

The father-of-one also told authorities he broke into as many as 30 homes throughout the country, and he talked about covering up a homicide through arson.

The timeline begins in summer of 1997 or 1998, when Keyes abducted a teenage girl while she and friends were tubing on the Deschutes River, he told investigators.

The FBI said Keyes was living in Maupin, Oregon, at the time, and the abduction is believed to have occurred near that area.

The FBI said Keyes lived in Neah Bay, Washington in 2001 after he was discharged from the Army.

The timeline states that Keyes committed his first homicide while living in the area. The identity of the victim is not known, and neither is the location of the murder.

Keyes moved to Anchorage in 2007 but continued to travel extensively outside the state.

After killing Koenig, Keyes flew to New Orleans where he went on a cruise. He left Koenig's body in a shed outside his Anchorage home for two weeks, according to the FBI.

After the cruise, Keyes drove to Texas. The FBI said that during this time, Keyes may have been responsible for a homicide in Texas or a nearby state - a crime Keyes denied. He was arrested in Lufkin, Texas, about six weeks after Koenig's disappearance.

Keyes had sought a ransom and used Koenig's debit card. Three weeks after the arrest, Koenig's dismembered body was found in a frozen lake north of Anchorage.

The FBI said Keyes also traveled internationally, but it's unknown if he killed anyone outside the U.S.

In December last year, Keyes was found dead after slashing his wrists with a razor blade.

After his death the Alaska Department of Corrections admitted a blade was mistakenly issued to  in 
his jail cell allowing him commit suicide.

The razor was never found.
