Rory McIlroy has had a year to remember after winning both The Open and the PGA Championship this year, and the world No 1 appeared to be in the mood to celebrate as he and a pal joined a group of pretty girls at the 
Lowry hotel in Manchester at 3am on Sunday.

It's been an exciting few weeks for the sportsman who enjoyed a summer of success - he won his first Open Championship at Hoylake in July before triumphing at Valhalla last week.

The Northern Irishman, who is a Manchester United fan, also backed Louis van Gaal to lead the club to the Premier League title before he paraded his Claret Jug at Old Trafford during half-time of the 2-1 defeat by Swansea.

Towards the
 end of May, McIlroy surprisingly broke off his engagement to tennis star 
Caroline Wozniacki just days after sending out wedding invitations.

The couple started dating in 2011 and got engaged on New Year's Eve.

McIlroy

in terms of my golf. I've put a bit more time into it and it has 
refocused me. I mean, what else do I have to do now?

'I go to

worked pretty hard before but the past couple of months I've really just
 buried myself in my game.

'It obviously works pretty well, so I am going to keep doing it.'

On
 Thursday, McIlroy posted a picture of his father posing with the Claret 
jug and joked: '"Dad... It's not a footrest, it's the claret jug!!" 
Incredible few weeks, can't wait to get home and see the family!'
