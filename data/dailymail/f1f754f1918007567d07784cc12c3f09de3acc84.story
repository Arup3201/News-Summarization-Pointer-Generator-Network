Dawn Ward, star of Real Housewives of Cheshire, has revealed her lavish lifestyle in a new interview saying she will only drink champagne and revealing she has a home cinema in her £15million home

The interview revealed that Dawn's ten-bedroom property includes a walk-in wardrobe that would fit two Range Rovers and she has huge kitchen - she is pictured here before changing her hair colour

From spending thousands of pounds on Champagne every year to having a home cinema and a home salon in her ten-bedroom, £15million mansion. 

Her daughters rooms include giant pink beds, one of which is shaped like a castle. 

The paper reports, during a tour of her sprawling Cheshire home, that Dawn's house also features a walk-in wardrobe, that would fit two Range Rovers, and a wine cellar filled with bottles of Bollinger and Laurent Perrier Rose Champagne.

By her own admission Dawn will never touch sparking wine, sticking only to true Champagne.

She said: 'I don't do Prosecco, babe, only the real stuff. I have a gag reflex if anyone tries to hand me a glass of that s***.'

But successful business woman Dawn says she doesn't rely on her husband Ashley, an ex Manchester-City player to provide her endless supply of fizz.

In the interview Dawn says that she will only drink Champagne and that her 'gag reflex' will come into play if anyone hands her a glass of prosecco

'I've always worked,' she told the newspaper, 'I've always been entrepreneurial. I don't want to rely on anyone, ever. 

'Fortunately I met my soulmate - we've been together 26 years and he's the love of my life. But I don't want to think ten years down the line, "How much can I get from him?" From the day we met, we've had 50:50 relationship and split absolutely everything.'

Dawn and Ashley met when she was a young model in a carpark in Bolton, and the Liz Hurley lookalike admits that she originally went on a date with him to make her ex-boyfriend jealous. 

However, the pair hit it off and Ashley asked her to marry him five years later - in the very same car park.  

Dawn stars alongside Lauren Simon, Tanya Bardsley, Leanne Brown, Magali Gorre and Ampika Pickston in the hit ITV2 series Real Housewives of Cheshire. 

The series follows the women in their day to day lives. The cameras follow Dawn as she does about her business running one of the top interior design companies in the UK.

In the interview Dawn boasts that she's picked herself up some top celebrity clients along the way including Steven and Alex Gerrard, Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancey and the Rooney family.

She reveals that she even worked on Coleen and Wayne's son Kai's nursery, telling the Mirror that her brief had simply been, 'white and wow'.

At home she likes to look after her family but admits that she doesn't like the dirty work. She says: 'I don't peel potatoes or clean dishes. I also don't really do walking unless I have to.'  

Dawn and Ashley have four children and she says she's been overwhelmed by the support that she and her family have had from the fans of the show.
