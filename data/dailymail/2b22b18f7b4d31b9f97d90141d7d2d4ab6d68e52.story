Many drone operators already use GoPro cameras on their flying machines, so it was only a matter of time before the firm launched a range of its own.

Sources ‘familiar with the plans’ told the Wall Street Journal that the California-based firm is looking to release a range of multirotor helicopters ‘late next year’.

The devices would be fitted with GoPro cameras, controlled remotely and are expected to retail for between $500 (£317) and $1,000 (£634).

Sources ‘familiar with the plans’ told the Wall Street Journal GoPro is looking to release a range of drones ‘late next year’, expected to retail between $500 (£317) and $1,000 (£634). They would be fitted with a GoPro camera and controlled remotely, and would directly rival drones from the likes of Parrot and DJI (pictured)

At this price range, the drones would be targeted more towards consumers and hobbyists and compete with market leaders Parrot and DJI, rather than rival the likes of professional devices from senseFly.

GoPro action cameras start at entry-level devices such as the Hero that costs $129.99 (£99.99 in the UK), up to the top-of-the range Hero4 Black model, for $499 (£369.99 in the UK).

It is likely the entry level drones will feature the cheaper versions of its cameras, while the high-end copters will be fitted with the next-generation versions.

Earlier this week, DJI launched its $2,900 (£1,840) Inspire 1 drone (pictured), dubbed the world’s first flying 4K camera.It maintains stability in strong wind conditions, transmits 1080p video wirelessly up to one mile (1.7km) away, and comes with a mobile app to control the gadget

And, if they are to rival current drones on the market, the GoPro models would need to feature advanced software and controls, image stabilisation and 4K recording.

Earlier this week drone maker DJI launched its $2,900 (£1,840) Inspire 1 drone. 

It is the world’s first flying 4K camera.

The Inspire 1 maintains stability in strong wind conditions, transmits 1080p video wirelessly up to one mile (1.7km) away, and comes with a mobile app to control the gadget. 

It lasts for around 18 minutes in the air before needing to be recharged. 

MailOnline has contacted GoPro for more information.

And in September, physicists from Stanford University unveiled a foldable drone, dubbed a cross between a GoPro and a quadcopter.

Called Nixie, the drone folds up and attaches to a wrist strap.

When the wearer wants it to start filming, they press a button and the drone unfolds and flies overhead, tracking their movements using motion sensors.

It was developed by Dr Christoph Kohstall, a physics researcher at Stanford University, with colleagues Jelena Jovanovic and Michael Niedermayr.

And the concept recently won Intel’s annual Make It Wearable competition.
