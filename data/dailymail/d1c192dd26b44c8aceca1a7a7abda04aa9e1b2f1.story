For the first time, researchers have grown a muscle that moves and works just like fibres found in a living human body.

Made from human cells, the lab-grown artificial muscle tissue responded to electrical pulses during tests, and reacted to drug treatments in the same way a hospital patient would.

Experts now hope the tissue could be used to develop personalised treatments and drugs for patients suffering from muscular disorders.

For the first time, researchers have grown a muscle that moves and works just like fibres found in the human the body. Made from human cells, the lab-grown artificial muscle tissue responded to electrical pulses (pictured), as well as drug treatments in the same way a hospital patient would

The muscle could also be used to study diseases, and be used in place of human drug trials.

The study was led by Nenad Bursac, associate professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University, and Lauran Madden, a postdoctoral researcher in Professor Bursac's laboratory.

‘The beauty of this work is that it can serve as a test bed for clinical trials in a dish,’ said Professor Bursac.

Scientists have grown 'fully-functioning' human gut tissue inside a mouse - a breakthrough that could one day help many thousands suffering with intestinal disorders.

By transplanting cells from a human into a mouse, paediatric surgeons successfully grew small intestine tissue that worked just like the 'real' thing.

The research was led by Dr Tracy Grikscheit from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). 

Doctors hope their findings will eventually help treat a range of digestive conditions as well as boost survival rates in sufferers of diseases such as short bowel syndrome (SBS) - a condition that kills nearly a third of young patients within five years.

‘We are working to test drugs without jeopardising a patient's health and also to reproduce the functional and biochemical signals of diseases - especially rare ones and those that make taking muscle biopsies difficult.’

Professor Bursac and Ms Madden started with a small sample of human cells that had already progressed beyond stem cells, but hadn't yet become muscle tissue.

They expanded these by more than a 1000-fold, and then put them into a form of 3D scaffolding filled with a nourishing gel.

This gel helped the cells to form aligned and functioning muscle fibres.

Ms Madden put the new muscle through a series of tests to determine how closely it resembled tissue found in the human body.

She found that the muscle fibres robustly contracted in response to electrical stimuli - a first for human muscle grown in a laboratory.

She also showed that the signalling pathways allowing nerves to activate the muscle were 'intact and functional'.

‘We have a lot of experience making bioartifical muscles from animal cells in the lab, and it still took us a year of adjusting variables like cell and gel density and optimising the culture matrix and media to make this work with human muscle cells,’ said Ms Madden.

To see if the muscle could be used for medical tests, Professor Bursac and Mr Madden also studied its response to a variety of drugs, including statins used to lower cholesterol and clenbuterol, a drug known to be used off-label as a performance enhancer for athletes.

The effects of the drugs matched those seen in human patients.

‘One of our goals is to use this method to provide personalised medicine to patients,’ said Professor Bursac. 

‘We can take a biopsy from each patient, grow many new muscles to use as test samples and experiment to see which drugs would work best for each person.’

The research is published in the journal eLife.

This is the first time lab-grown muscles have reacted in this way
