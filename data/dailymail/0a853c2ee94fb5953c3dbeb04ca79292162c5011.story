Bath sensationally reignited their Champions Cup campaign yesterday, and in the process presented England with a timely vision of midfield magic. 

This demolition of one of Europe’s superpowers was a result to rank with the finest achieved by Premiership teams in Continental combat. 

Toulouse had lost only one of their last 17 home matches against English opposition but they were run ragged by Mike Ford’s rampant side, who claimed the bonus-point victory which gives them a strong chance of qualifying for the quarter-finals.

 If Bath can beat Glasgow at home and score four tries, Toulouse would only top the pool by securing a maximum return from their trip to Montpellier. Even if Bath are edged out of top spot, they may well go through as one of the leading three runners-up.

But such considerations were not of immediate concern in the away dressing room last night. Whatever it means in the bigger picture of the tournament, this was a stand-alone performance of stunning quality and magnitude.

Bath won with a swagger. They won by attacking from all parts when the opportunities arose and by doing so with often breathtaking cohesion and intent. In the first half they delivered rugby from the heavens and nearly had the contest wrapped up before the break.

The thrills were provided by the England trio at the heart of their back line. George Ford, Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph simply tore the Toulouse defence to shreds. The French side could not contain the mesmerising, high-octane threats in Bath’s 10, 12 and 13 shirts.

Joseph stood out in particular — even before his chip ahead and slaloming run created the late bonus-point try. 

This was a vision of collective class which will give the England coaches much to ponder when they gather for a final selection meeting today ahead of the announcement on Wednesday of their Six Nations squad. Ford is a certainty at fly-half, but the clamour for Eastmond and Joseph to be unleashed alongside him is growing. An artistic combination awaits the call en masse.

Mike Ford offered his own ecstatic assessment after this epic triumph at Stade Ernest Wallon, saying: ‘JJ was sublime, outstanding, world class — all those things. Kyle was outstanding. Anthony Watson was good.

 England have a lot of decisions to make, but there is no denying what the England boys did out there today.’

Asked about Joseph’s case for a return to the Test side, Bath’s director of rugby added: ‘He’s very close. It depends on the way Stuart Lancaster wants to play, but JJ has really stepped it up. I know the England coaches are meeting tomorrow, so they’re going to have a good re-think.’

If Lancaster and his assistants want to exploit the potential of their wide runners, then the evidence of the first half-hour here should convince them that Eastmond and Joseph must be in the mix. They inspired Bath’s onslaught which caused disbelief in the stadium.

An early George Ford penalty was followed by a slick first try for the visitors in the seventh minute. Leroy Houston’s forceful drive generated impetus, then Chris Cook’s deft off-load released Francois Louw and the Springbok flanker sent giant wing Matt Banahan galloping over.

Ford converted to give his side a double-digit lead but Toulouse’s power was always likely to be a factor and, sure enough, they hit back with a try from a lineout drive, but it proved to be a brief reprieve. 

In the 24th minute, as the hosts were building menacingly in the Bath 22, Jean-Marc Doussain’s pass was intercepted by Cook, who sprinted 80 metres to score.

Moments later, Ford’s men struck again in fine style. Eastmond stormed clear from his own half, picked out Banahan with a well-timed pass and the wing in turn off-loaded for Joseph to touch down.

The conversion made it 22-7 and soon after, Bath almost killed the contest. Horacio Agulla set off a raid from deep, Ford and Joseph kept up the momentum but Watson failed to take the chance.

When Yoann Huget, who later disgraced himself with a theatrical dive, went over at the other end, it looked as if Bath might pay for squandering that opening. But they didn’t, thanks to a display of defiant spirit to go with all their eye-catching flair.

George Ford’s try-saving tackle on the rampaging Yannick Nyanga was a turning point, as were the scrum penalties the visitors won — the last of which brought one last penalty at the end. There was also a double-team tackle on Luke McAlister by Matt Garvey and Carl Fearns which typified the resistance.

Joseph created Bath’s fourth try out of nothing nine minutes from time. From near halfway, he sent a deft little kick behind the defensive line, darted through to re-gather and swerved left around two flailing opponents. Ross Batty charged on towards the line and he in turn sent Louw swallow-diving over.

It was a magnificent try to cap a magnificent performance which suggests that Bath are on course to return to Europe’s top table after a long absence.
