A two-year-old girl has died of meningococcal disease in north Queensland.

The toddler from Dysart - in central Queensland - was airlifted to Townsville Hospital with symptoms of the illness, and later died on Friday.

Meningococcal is a bacterial disease spread via droplets from the nose or throat during coughing and sneezing.

It can cause fever, diarrhoea and convulsions, and complications can result in death.

Public health authorities say her death highlights the danger of the disease.

North Queensland public health physician Dr Steven Donohue said the illness can be treated with antibiotics but severe cases can quickly turn deadly without prompt medical attention.

Queensland Health protocol offers immunisation for toddlers at 12 months of age for one strain of the disease but Dr Donohue said that just because a child has been vaccinated does not completely remove the risk of infection.

'It's important to vaccinate children but it's also important if there are signs of rapid and severe infection that those people are seen as quickly as possible by doctors,' Dr Donohue told AAP.

'You don't muck around if you've contacted meningococcal. 

'You get those symptoms, you have to go to a hospital day or night, and tell them you've been in contact with a meningococcal.'

It is unknown if the girl in this case had been vaccinated though Dr Donohue said the patient did not attend daycare and there was little risk of further cases.

'The probability of secondary cases of meningococcal is actually very low,' he said.

'It's probably 100 to one against having a second case in any one case.

'The risk of any one case to the general community is minimal. Really we're looking at close household contacts.' 

The girl was flown from Dysart - in central Queensland - to Townsville Hospital where she died on Friday
