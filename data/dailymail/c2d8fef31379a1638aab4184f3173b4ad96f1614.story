Comedian Ted Shiress, 27 (pictured), from Roath, Cardiff, claims he was turned away twice from Empire restaurant in Cardiff city centre by staff

An Indian restaurant has been forced to apologise after turning away a cerebral palsy sufferer on two occasions and telling him he needed to be 'accompanied by an adult'.

Ted Shiress, 27, from Roath, Cardiff, claims he was turned away twice from Empire restaurant in Cardiff city centre by staff.

Writing about his experience on his blog, the comedian said he was left feeling 'shocked and hurt' after being flatly refused a table and said it was 'just not acceptable'.

Mujib Mohammed, who owns the restaurant, has now apologised for the incident and said actions by one member of staff were 'completely inappropriate but stemmed from a lack of awareness' rather than an intention to discriminate.

Mr Shiress, a former finalist of the Welsh Unsigned Stand-Up Award, said he tried to visit the Indian restaurant several times last week.

He said the first time he attempted to eat at the restaurant he was told 'We're full, go please,' despite there being 'visibly empty tables'.

He said he returned two days later to book a table for a future visit but was told to 'come in with a caretaker'.

However, he said that despite the comment, he decided to return 48 hours later with his mother and was told once again that the restaurant was 'full'.

Writing on his blog, he said: 'At this point I could sense my mother losing her rag as she popped out to remind the waiter I had booked.

'The sight of my mother then pleased the waiter as he said: "Oh good, you have a responsible adult this time".

'Reasonably my mother then inquired what this meant, explaining that she may be my mother but she's also my guest who lives in London and does not look after me.

'He clearly failed to process this information as he went on to insist "He" (yes, "he"!!) "needs a caretaker, what if he had an accident?(sic)".

'Although she then tried suggesting anyone could have an accident, I had had enough at this point and insisted we go.'

Mr Mohammed responded to Mr Shiress' comments via his blog, saying he was 'extremely disappointed' by the incident. He said all staff at the eatery would now be given disability awareness training.

'We wish to offer Ted a full and frank apology for what happened,' he said.

The cerebral palsy sufferer  said he was left feeling 'shocked and hurt' after his treatment by the restaurant

'Having read his blog we immediately undertook an internal investigation and our findings showed that the actions of one of our members of staff were completely inappropriate, but stemmed from a lack of understanding and awareness of disability rather than an active attempt to discriminate.

'To this end we will be arranging for our entire restaurant team to undergo disability awareness training at the earliest opportunity in the new year.'

He added: 'We would welcome the opportunity to apologise to you in person, but in the meantime we sincerely and publicly apologise for any upset caused and would like to reassure you that this kind of occurrence will never happen again.'

Mr Shiress has played some of the leading venues on the comedy circuit, including The Glee Clubs in Cardiff and Birmingham, as well as major festivals such as Green Man in Brecon.

He said as a comedian he has a thick skin but had still felt hurt by the treatment.

'I can only imagine how it would hurt someone more sensitive,' he said.

'I'm pleased at what he said but it's the manager I feel should apologise.'
