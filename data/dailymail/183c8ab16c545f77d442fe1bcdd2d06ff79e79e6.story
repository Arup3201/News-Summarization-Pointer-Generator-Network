He is the billionaire bondage fanatic fanning the flames of lust in women across the globe.

A large part of Christian Grey's allure no doubt comes from the fact that readers are able to conjure up their very own fantasy figure as they read the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy.

But now, as plans for a Hollywood version of Fifty Shades get underway and casting begins for the man who will play this most sensational of roles, thoughts have turned to just what this magnetic mystery male should look like.

The face of Christian Grey? An academic has used descriptions and image-generating software to create the so-called first picture of the protagonist of EL James's novel Fifty Shades of Grey

Ahead of the big reveal, scientists have come up with their very own version of Christian Grey - created using the same e-fit software used to catch criminals.

They have today revealed what they are dubbing the 'first picture' of the Fifty Shades protagonist, who previously only existed inside the imagination of the reader.

Using the e-fit software employed in police investigations they strived to put a face to the mysterious character at the centre of millions of women's fantasies.

They created the black-and-white image - which shows a man with tousled hair and high cheekbones - based on descriptions of how women imagined him to look.

The handsome composite was the brainchild of University of Central Lancashire's (UCLan) Dr Faye Skelton, who said the man in the image had drawn comparisons with famous actors and sports stars.

She took the descriptions from 12 female readers' to create the striking image.

Greys Anatomy star Patrick Dempsey's 
eyes were cited as those women thought Christian Grey might have, while 
Brad Pitt's famous chiselled jawline was used to help create the fantasy
 Christian Grey's face.

Dr Skelton said: "While we don't want
 to intrude on anyone's fantasies, based on a small sample of women, 
this is the image of Christian Grey they have in their heads when 
reading the novels.

'Personally, I think he's quite handsome, although everyone's interpretation will be different.

'It was just a bit of fun, but it does show the quality of image we can now generate.

'Most
 of the descriptions drew comparisons with famous film stars, which may 
help Hollywood moguls when the film remake comes to casting.'

One
 fan, Laura Stokes, 24, from Perry Barr, Birmingham, said: 'I think it's
 better if it's left to women's imaginations rather than a computer - 
but it still pretty clever.

Fifty Shades of fantasy: The e-fit, made from combining a list of 12 famous faces, has echoes of TOWIE star Mark Wright, left, and right, rugby star Jonny Wilkinson

Real life Christian Greys? the computer generated image of Christian Grey has drawn comparisons with model David Gandy, left, and right, Welsh rugby star Gavin Henson

'It's not the image I have of him in my head, but he's very good looking nonetheless.'

The e-fit, the result of a combination of 12 famous faces, looked strangely familar, drawing comparisons with former England rugby captain Jonny Wilkinson, and fellow rugby playing peer and ex-partner of Charlotte Church, Gavin Henson.

Others thought the e-fit bore more than a passing resemblance to Eddie Redmayne, thanks to the full lips, and Mark Wright of TOWIE for his chiselled jaw and classic good looks.

Model David Gandy earned a mention, as did fellow model Paul Sculfor.

Author EL James' first book in the trilogy has sold ten million copies world-wide becoming the fastest-selling novel of all time - outselling Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and even JK Rowling's Harry Potter books.

Last week an academic warned that Britain faces a surge in baby births next year because the raunchy trilogy is driving women into bed more than ever before.
