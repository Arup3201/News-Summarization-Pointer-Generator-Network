An Allegiant Airlines flight from Grand Rapids, Michigan, to Orlando has been forced to make an emergency landing after the cabin depressurized on Sunday night.

Passengers aboard the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 put on oxygen masks and pilots forced the plane down at Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina. 

None of the 159 passengers aboard the plane were hurt - despite the harrowing experience. 

Flight 683 took off as normal about 5.34pm on Sunday from Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids.

Passenger Katie Gilbert said she and two other fliers didn't wait for the plane to take off again - they rented a car and drove the rest of the way to Orlando

About two hours into the flight to Orlando-Sanford International Airport, the plane began to experience cabin pressure problems, WOOD-TV reports. 

The plane's oxygen masks dropped down from their overhead compartments and flight attendants began helping passengers put them on.

The pilots dropped the plane to 10,000 feet before landing in Greenville - the nearest major airport.

Katie Gilbert, a Michigan native who was on her way back to her home in Orlando, told WOOD-TV that passengers remained remarkably cool-headed during the emergency.

'Everybody seemed to be relatively calm and pretty collected. Nothing crazy,' she said.

The flight landed in South Carolina. Passengers stayed at the airport until Monday morning, when they were finally flown to Orlando

She did, however, have some lasting effects from the emergency.

'Thanks to @AllegiantTravel I can not hear due to a full loss of cabin pressure,' she tweeted. 

Most of the passengers spent the night in South Carolina before the Allegiant flight took off again for Orlando about 11am today.

Ms Gilbert, however, had enough of flying. She and two other passengers rented a car and drove the six hours to Florida on Sunday night.

Allegiant said it is giving each passenger a refund for the flight and a $200 voucher for future tickets.
