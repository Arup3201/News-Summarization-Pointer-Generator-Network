Wisconsin lawmakers voted Friday to make their state the 25th to enact 'right-to-work' legislation, pushing a fast-tracked bill through the Assembly after an overnight debate and sending it on to Gov. Scott Walker for his promised signature.

The Assembly passed the bill 62-35 after a marathon session that included about 20 hours of debate. It was a straight party-line vote, with no Democrats backing the contentious measure that will ban unions from forcing non-members to pay dues.

A likely 2016 presidential candidate who rose to national prominence by taking on public-sector unions four years ago, Walker plans to sign the right-to-work legislation into law on Monday. 

'Today is the day we have solidified the regressive era in Wisconsin,' Democratic Rep. Terese Berceau, of Madison, said minutes before the vote.

Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, walks off the floor after passage of right-to-work on Friday. The bill passed on a party-line vote, with Republicans in support and all Democrats against. The Senate passed it last week

The proposal would make it a crime punishable by up to nine months in jail to require private-sector workers who aren't in a union to pay dues.

Supporters argued it would make Wisconsin more attractive to businesses looking to move in or expand. But opponents said the goal is to destroy unions, which tend to vote Democrat, and a right-to-work law would depress wage and create more dangerous workplaces, in turn hurting the economy.

Twenty-four other states have right-to-work laws. Michigan and Indiana were the two most recent states to enact it, both in 2012. 

The protests from unions in Wisconsin were not nearly as large as they were four years ago when Walker and Republicans in the state legislature pushed through reforms to public sector unions, growing only as large as about 3,000 people compared with 100,000 in 2011.

And only a handful of protesters were on hand for Friday's deliberations. 

Two people were arrested Thursday for refusing to stop screaming profanities, a spokesman for Walker's administration said.

The vote came after Walker said in September, during his re-election campaign, that right-to-work was not a priority and wouldn't come up this session. Walker called it a distraction and feared that protests would grow as large as those in 2011 when he effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers

Legislative leaders, including Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, also said right-to-work would not be debated. 

But two weeks ago, when Senate Republicans said they were going forward with it, Walker said he would sign it

Pointing out that 'the bill would be dead if he opposed' it, Arnold Shober, a political science professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, told TPM last week that Walker had to side with his party on the issue.

'He knows that it will court controversy, but he cannot afford to lose potential GOP primary voters,' Shober said.

Opponents of the Wisconsin legislature's 'right-to-work' measure rallied at the state Capitol last Saturday. The proposal, due to be signed next week by Walker, would outlaw the mandatory payment of union dues from workers

'Legislative leaders know this, and see now as an opportunity to pass right-leaning legislation while the state political climate is very favorable.'

Walker is scheduled to be in Iowa for an agriculture summit on Saturday that's attracting other likely Republican presidential candidates.

The Wisconsin executive's well-established intentions to compete for the Oval Oval next year had state Democrats accusing their Republican colleagues of pressing the issue to help Walker's likely presidential campaign, even though Walker had said he didn't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics.

They called on Walker to veto the bill.

'It's the workers in this state that are suffering through the politics of our governor's ambitions,' said Democratic Rep. Cory Mason of Racine.

Vos accused Democrats of having 'Walker derangement syndrome,' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues.

'I'm not going to apologize about using the word freedom,' said Republican Rep. Jeremy Thiesfeldt of Fond du Lac. 'I'm going to use it over and over again because that's what this is about.'

Democratic Rep. LaTonya Johnson of Milwaukee, and a member of AFSCME, said she cares about people more than freedom.

'It just angers me to know that we come here and we pass bills that affect people's everyday lives and we don't have a clue as to how those everyday people live or how they survive,' Johnson said. 'This bill is a bunch of crap.'  

The national campaign arm of state Democrats, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement that 'Wisconsin Republicans should be ashamed of this savage attack on unions and the hard-working men and women.'

It called on Wisconsin lawmakers to put aside their 'right-wing ideology aside to promote policies that actually help the state’s middle class.'

A crowd protests outside the Wisconsin Senate during an extraordinary session on the right-to-work bill last week. The group much smaller than the one in 2011 against Walker's law stripping public sector unions of much of their power and 100,000 protesters camped out. Still, the largest rally attracted roughly 3,000 people

'Instead of addressing the real problems facing Wisconsin,' DLCC Executive Director Michael Sargeant said, citing a $2.2 billion budget deficit, 'Republicans decided instead to speed the passage of legislation that lowers wages, interferes with the operations of private companies, and satisfies the demands of the right-wing special interest groups that seem to have been calling the shots in Scott Walker’s Wisconsin since he took office.' 

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative non-profit with chapters across the country that spent $7 million to defend Walker after the 2011 spat with unions said Friday afternoon that 'every American deserves the right to work where they please without being compelled to pay dues, just as they have the right to join a union if they choose.'

'We’re pleased that Wisconsin is once again leading the way when it comes to worker freedom,' AFP Chief Operating Officer Luke Hilgemann said in a statement.

AFP-Wisconsin State Director David Fladeboe said in a secondary statement that his chapter is 'excited to see this commonsense legislation move the state forward and finally bring relief for workers who simply want to do their jobs.'

'No longer will the Badger State’s employees be compelled to join a labor union or surrender union dues as a condition of employment,' he said and thanked the organization's volunteers for writing letters to lawmakers, calling their offices and going door-to-door in support of the campaign.
