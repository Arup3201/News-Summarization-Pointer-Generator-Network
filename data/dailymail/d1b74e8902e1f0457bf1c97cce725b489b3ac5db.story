Embossed toothbrushes for prisoners – handed out by the Ministry of Justice and paid for by the taxpayer – are being sold on eBay.

The white toothbrushes were ordered by the MoJ last year and the individually packaged brushes cost the taxpayer up to £3,300 each month.

The Prison Officers’ Association (POA) branded the eBay sales as ‘purely wrong’.

The brushes are embossed with HMPS (Her Majesty’s Prison Service) and the MoJ confirmed last night that prisoners could take them with them when discharged.

Now they are being sold on eBay for 99p. Five have already gone and bidding will close on the sixth today.

One seller’s description read: ‘HMP toothbrush. HMPS embossed on brush. Fully sealed.’ It specified that the brush is ‘brand new’.

Another put three toothbrushes on the site as well as prison toothpaste.

The POA called for the Government to investigate the eBay sales.

The association’s Glyn Travis said: ‘People are profiteering from taxpayers’ money, that’s purely wrong.’

EBay declined to comment.
