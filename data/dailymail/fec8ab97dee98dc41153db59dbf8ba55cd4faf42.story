If you're nearing the end of your twenties, you might want to start thinking happier thoughts as a new survey has revealed that people are at their most miserable at the age of 29.

Those nearing the big 3-0 smile just 12 times a day on average, compared with those aged 79 who typically smile 16 or more times a day.

So happy are those close to entering their eighth decade, 33 per cent of 79-year-olds reported smiling an extremely cheerful 21 times a day.

The research also found that men tend to be grumpier and are four times more likely than women to go a whole day without smiling.

But if it's pressure to find a partner 
that is getting women down, they should smile more - as seven in 10 men 
say they are more interested in a date's smile than what she's wearing.

Office worker 
Shane Wilson, 29, said: 'I felt pretty car free in my early twenties and
pretty positive in my mid-twenties but not now.

'I
think approaching 30 has an effect. Ever since I turned 29 I feel like I
have a shadow over me - it's a feeling that I need to sort my life out. So I probably don't smile as much as I did a year or so ago.'

Broken down by geographical area, the results showed that those living in Belfast were the most cheerful and smile up to 20 times a day, while melancholy people in Bristol flash a grin as little as twice a day.

Perfect grins: The Duchess of Cambridge has the world's best smile while Harry Styles topped the men's poll

Despite their stony-faced reputation, Londoners actually smile around 10 times a day, which makes the capital the UK's second most cheerful city.

The research by iWhite Instant, a new bleach-free teeth whitening kit, also found 31 per cent of Brits think the Duchess of Cambridge has the world's best smile.

Model Cara Delevingne came bottom of the poll, while Simon Cowell and One Direction's Harry Styles were the men voted to have the best smiles.

The 2,045 adults polled also voted Victoria Beckham as the grumpiest celebrity in the UK.

Daniel Silvester from iWhite said: 'We wanted to gauge the nation's attitude towards smiling and were surprised to learn how little the majority of Brits smile in one day.

'We're hoping iWhite Instant can give Brits more confidence to smile more often and cheer up the country.'
