With £28million new boy Wilfried Bony looking on from the bench all eyes were on Edin Dzeko.

How would the big man react?

The arrival of last season's Premier League top scorer already seems to have prompted the departure of one City striker, with Stevan Jovetic not even included in Manuel Pellegrini's squad for this one.

Dzeko scored his side's third goal in Manchester City's 5-0 win against Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium

Edin Dzeko: 2 Premier League goals 

Wilfried Bony: 9 Premier League goals (all for Swansea)

Sergio Aguero: 17 Premier League goals 

Stevan Jovetic: 5 Premier League goals 

And while Dzeko landed a place in the starting XI it appeared as though this was the Chilean's bid to turn up the heat.

It did not take too much time to find an answer. 26 seconds, to be precise.

That is how long had passed when Dzeko nicked the ball from an inexplicably slumbering Vurnon Anita. The Dutchman then sent him flying and Sergio Aguero made no mistake from the spot.

Simple, sharp and effective, it was the kind of vintage City that they had not seen in these parts for some time.

It got better quickly.

Dzeko has often been accused of being selfish, despite being paid to score goals.

Dzeko celebrates with his Manchester City team-mates after scoring against John Carver's side 

The 28-year-old played the full 90 minutes as Manchester City ran out 5-0 winners 

But after setting up Aguero's penalty he showed his giving side again 10 minutes later when he found Samir Nasri with an admittedly-deflected pass. Eight yards out and with the freedom of the Etihad, the Frenchman could not miss.

All that was missing now for Dzeko was a goal. He had to wait another 10 minutes for that. The pass, linked over the middle from David Silva, was exquisite. The chest down and left-footed finish from Dzeko sublime.

Hell hath no fury like a Bosnian scorned.

Before the half was over, and with a less forgiving referee than Chris Foy, it could have been even better but Dzeko saw two decent penalty appeals turned down.

Newcastle simply could not handle him.

Newcastle goalkeeper Dzeko was unable to get a hand on to Dzeko's first-half strike 

Yaya Toure may have been back in the side, Bony may have been on the bench and Aguero may have been looking close to his best but it was Dzeko's name the gleeful City fans belted out time and time again before half-time.

Only Tim Krul, quick off his line, denied him a second as the cakewalk continued after the break.

On the hour mark the new man came on for Aguero and the pair linked well with the game won and the pressure off.

Manuel Pellegrini may ask him why he needlessly handled home a corner late on to pick up a deserved yellow card but the manager will have been pleased with the response.

He may have been wearing gloves (because it's always tropical in Sarajevo) but there was nothing cold about red hot Dzeko here.
