Bored of your surroundings and want to liven things up? Or fancy destroying that broken bit of office machinery?

Now there’s an app that’ll add a bit of action movie magic into your life by super-imposing dramatic special effects over mobile phone footage.

Action Movie FX for iPhone comes courtesy of J.J. Abrams’ production company Bad Robot Interactive, which is behind Star Trek, Super 8 and Mission Impossible 3.

SCROLL DOWN FOR MAILONLINE'S BLOCKBUSTER DEBUT

Kaboom: A MailOnline reporter finds himself in the line of fire

Dramatic: The app's effects are incredibly realistic

Leave it to the professionals: The company behind the app, Bad Robot, has plenty of expertise with movie special effects

The free app comes with two effects – a missile strike and a car crash, and the results are incredible.

Simply hit record and film a scene, then use a slider to mark the point at which you want the ‘fx’ to begin.

The missile strike is gigantic and a burning pile of rubble is left behind after the initial explosion.

The car crash is equally professional-looking. Swirls of dust precede an SUV dropping out of the sky and flying into the camera.

Car-nage: A terrifying car crash is one of the free effects that comes with the app

Lights, iPhone, action! For 99 cents you can add in a helicopter crash

Gunning for filmmaking glory: The app also features fake armed police

Simple: The app is straightforward to use and it only takes seconds before you've made special-effects-laden footage

There are even action-movie sound effects to accompany the carnage.

More effects, such as a helicopter falling from the sky, can be added for a small fee.

So far it’s proving hugely popular, with one user, Jimmo Olson, commenting: ‘I ordered a missile strike on my office calendar. Looks like I’m leaving early today.’
