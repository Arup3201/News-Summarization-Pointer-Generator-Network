His rival is known for his  'discount double-check' touchdown celebration. 

So when NFL star Stephen Tulloch sacked Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers, he felt there was only one thing to do - mimic it. 

But the Detroit Lions linebacker's plan quickly fell through when his knee gave way and he crashed to the ground, leaving him with a potentially serious injury.

Injurty: Detroit Lions linebacker Stephen Tulloch is seen injuring his knee performing a sack dance yesterday

Mocking: Tulloch (pictured, left, during yesterday's game) was apparently mocking Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers (right) 'discount double-check' touchdown celebration when his knee gave way and he collapsed

Tulloch, who has never missed a game in his nine-year NFL career, has refused to comment on the extent of the injury until he further testing is completed.

However, he spent the final three-quarters of the Lions' 19-7 victory over the Packers stood on the sideline with a large ice pack wrapped around his knee.

The 29-year-old, who had performed two tackles and sacked Rodgers on a third-and-10 before leaving the game yesterday, described his failed celebration as 'unfortunate'.

He told the Detroit Free Press: 'You're passionate about the game and you want to get up and celebrate and it happened.

Celebration: Tulloch (far right), who is due to have an MRI today, was seen bending his knees during the game

In pain: The linebacker then grabs his knee, before suddenly crumpling on the ground and walking off the field

'People do it a million times, but unfortunately  it happened to me. Sitting on the sideline is new to me. It's sickening. But I'll be all right. I'll be able to help this team move forward if everything goes well.'

He added that he had not experienced much swelling in his knee joint, which could only be 'positive'.

Tulloch, who is due to undergo an MRI today, was filmed lifting his arms and bending his knees in an apparent mockery of quarterback Rodgers' 'discount double-check' celebration.

Footage shows him then suddenly crumpling on the ground, before walking off the field and testing his knee on an exercise bike behind the bench.

Coach: Tulloch's coach Jim Caldwell (pictured yesterday) has  refused to comment on the severity of the injury

He returned for two plays on Green Bay's next drive, but shortly left the game in Detroit for good.

Following the incident, the Lions moved DeAndre Levy into middle linebacker, while Tahir Whitehead played as second linebacker for the remainder of the game.

Tulloch's coach Jim Caldwell, who has also refused to comment on the severity of his injury, said he was pleased the player had shown some 'enthusiasm' for the sport.

'That's why these guys play, that's why we coach it because you got passion for it. That was a big moment. Things happen,' he told the newspaper. 

It is not the first time a NFL star has injured their knee performing a celebration.

In 2001, former Arizona Cardinals placekicker Bill Gramatica tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) after celebrating a field goal.
