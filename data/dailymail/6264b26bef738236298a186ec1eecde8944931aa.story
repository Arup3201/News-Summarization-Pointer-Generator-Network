Tom Cruise's attorney has threatened the
 parent company of the National Enquirer with a multimillion-dollar 
lawsuit over a new issue asserting it has details of the actor's recent 
split with wife Katie Holmes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The website 
posted a letter from Cruise's Los Angeles attorney, Bert Fields, in 
which he blasts American Media Inc, parent of the Enquirer, for what he 
calls 'false and vicious lies.'

Fields went on to add that the 'lies' will cause 'hundreds of millions 
of dollars' in damages to Cruise.

Lawsuit: Tom Cruise's lawyer Bert Fields' letter draws attention to disparaging descriptions of Cruise in the Enquirer's issue that hit newsstands on Wednesday

'As you were notified in advance, your current issue of National Enquirer makes numerous false and defamatory assertions about our client Tom Cruise,' the three-page letter begins.

The letter draws attention to disparaging descriptions of Cruise in the Enquirer's issue that hit newsstands on Wednesday.

Fields wrote: 'These are all lies - vicious, hurtful, damaging lies.'

The lawyer did not respond to requests for comment and a representative for American
 Media could not be reached.

Cruise and Holmes have been the 
subject of hundreds of headlines worldwide since she filed for divorce 
from the Mission: Impossible movie star two weeks ago, seeking sole 
custody of their six-year-old daughter, Suri.

Earlier this week, the couple agreed to a divorce and custody arrangement, but details were undisclosed.

Both
 have remained publicly silent about the issue, except for one joint 
statement in which they said they were working together to settle their 
differences in the best interest of Suri.

Speculation
 about a reason for the split has centered on Cruise's membership in the
 Church of Scientology, but that has never been confirmed by either the 
couple or their representatives.

Cruise was last pictured on the set of his latest movie Oblivion yesterday and appears to be throwing himself into his work amidst all that is going on in his personal life.

Keeping himself busy: Cruise was seen wielding a silver prop as he shot his latest movie

The actor was wearing a blue and green 
checked shirt, a grey T-shirt and odd futuristic-looking trousers as he 
wielded a silver prop that appeared to be a gun.

Meanwhile, Holmes was spotted going out for dinner in New York City last night and for once was seen without Suri.

She took the youngster to Central Park Zoo earlier on in the day but clearly felt the need to spend time with friends last night.

Meanwhile, the fall-out from Tom and Katie's split has prompted a renewed interest in Scientology.

News of the break up launched searches on Yahoo! for the controversial religion resulting in searches for 'Scientology' going up 2,157 per cent.
