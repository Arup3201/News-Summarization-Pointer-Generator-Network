A Texas high school football coach has proven to be an ultimate team player by offering to donate more than half of his own liver to a terminally ill colleague.

Cypress Ridge High School coach Matthew Beeler is going to give 63-percent of his liver to fellow coach John McWilliams after the later developed transthyretin amyloidosis.

The genetic disorder stops the production of a protein needed for proper function of the vital organ and without it, McWilliams will experience organ failure.

Indeed, since his diagnosis two years ago, two of McWilliams three siblings have been struck down with the same disorder.

'After Thanksgiving, I came in and all the coaches were sitting in there,' McWilliams told Click2Houston.com. 'And I said, 'Hey guys, I need a liver.'

'I got up and said, 'Hey guys, I need a new liver. I need a portion of somebody's liver. If anyone has type O blood, you know, anybody wants to donate, I'd be more than happy to take it,'' said Coach McWilliams to ABC 13.

Beeler said that he stepped forward and when he discovered he was a match did not hesitate to help his friend.

'I said, 'Shoot, I couldn't help a nicer man,' Beeler told Click2Houston.com. 'It wasn't my decision to do it; I feel like I was put here to do it,' he said.

Beeler said he would be disappointed in himself he if didn't doante part of his liver.

'We teach and coach for a reason, and it's because we have this innate desire to help people. And how do you pass up the opportunity to do something great?'

On his part, McWilliams has said that he is grateful that Beeler heard his joke when he walked into the teacher's common room.

'There must have been some higher, you know, being there that sent this young man this way,' McWilliams told KTRK.
