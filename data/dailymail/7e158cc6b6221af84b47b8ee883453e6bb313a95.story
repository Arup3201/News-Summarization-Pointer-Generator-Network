Wasps are increasingly optimistic they will be able to keep hold of their ‘crown jewel’, England lock Joe Launchbury, in light of their fine victory over champions Northampton.

The 23-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and other clubs are permitted to officially approach him from January 1, if he has not agreed a new deal with his current employers by then.

Saracens are thought to be monitoring the situation and Wasps will be wary of losing another leading light to their London rivals, who lured Billy Vunipola away last year.

Such is Launchbury’s rising status in the game, there is sure to be a transfer-market scramble for his services if he becomes available, but Wasps director of rugby Dai Young is hopeful. ‘I am very confident that he will stay,’ said the Welshman. ‘It will be sorted, one way or the other, in the next couple of months.

‘He is the crown jewel and it would be a massive loss for us if we lost Joe. If we did, we would have to move on, like we did with Billy. A lot of people thought it was the end of the world when we lost Billy but we unearthed Nathan Hughes.We would be mega, mega disappointed if Joe did leave, but we will do everything in our power to keep hold of him. I am confident that Joe will stay, but if it gets to Christmas, I guess that is when you start to feel that things may not be going your way.’

Sunday’s result in High Wycombe, where Wasps stunned the Saints to win 20-16, could prove a factor in helping them to keep hold of Launchbury. He has asked for assurances about the stability and ambition of the club, and although the search for a permanent ground goes on, the financial outlook is more settled and the team are reviving.

‘Joe is not far off world-class now and no world-class second row wants to be involved in relegation fights every year,’ said Young. ‘No world-class second row wants to be involved in the lower tiers of competition. No world-class second row wants to worry about what squad the club has got, or whether it is going to be here in six months.’

Asked if he was concerned about the danger of lightning striking twice — after Vunipola appeared keen to stay at Wasps, but then chose to join his brother Mako at Saracens — Young added: ‘With Billy, the situation was slightly different. Off the field, the club had a lot of difficulties and he could see the unstable position we were in.

‘The external factors were huge with that — the family were pulling Billy towards Saracens. I don’t really see that being a factor with Launchers. Knowing Joe as I do, I don’t think he’ll just go to the highest bidder — that isn’t in his nature. He will be more worried about what is right for his rugby.’

Premiership clubs are poised to ratify an increase in the salary cap on Wednesday — to a maximum of £5.5million. In addition, each club will be allowed to recruit a second ‘excluded’ player — whose salary is not counted within the cap. They must be new to the league next season, or have not played in the competition for at least 12 months. This opens the door for clubs to sign the likes of Steffon Armitage or Toby Flood from France.

Bath received good news on Monday as a scan revealed their England wing, Anthony Watson, did not sustain significant ankle damage in the win over London Welsh, as first feared. Instead, he has a minor foot issue, but may even be fit in time to face Leicester at The Rec on Saturday.
