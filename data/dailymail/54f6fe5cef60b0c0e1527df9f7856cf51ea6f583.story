Dundee United wonderkid Ryan Gauld has clinched a sensational £3million move to European giants Sporting Lisbon on a six-year contract.

The 18-year-old jetted into the Portuguese capital on Tuesday with his agent, John Colquhoun, his dad and the United secretary John Taylor to finalise his dream switch to the Primeira Liga runners-up.

Gauld was undergoing a medical late on Tuesday night after agreeing personal terms on a contract that would run until 2020, as Sporting aimed to rush through the deal in time for their celebrations to mark the club’s 108th anniversary.

And, despite a few legal formalities still to be tied up, senior sources close to the move confirmed to Sportsmail that it was ‘essentially a done deal’.

It represents a stunning move for Gauld who, at the end of his breakthrough campaign in Scottish football, will now find himself playing in the Champions League with Sporting Lisbon next season.

The wide midfielder burst to prominence as a young and exciting United side finished fourth in last season’s Scottish Premiership and reached the Scottish Cup Final, only to lose 2-0 to St Johnstone.

His form led to scouts from European powerhouses like Real Madrid, Roma, Manchester United and Arsenal beating a path to Tannadice to watch the talented teenager in the flesh.

It also led United to shrewdly tie down their Scotland Under-21 star, who made 42 first-team appearances since his debut in 2012, by securing him on improved terms until 2016.

His profile was also substantially raised by his team-mates nicknaming him ‘Baby Messi’, due to the similarity in style and build to Argentina and Barcelona star Lionel Messi.

On Tuesday, United boss Jackie McNamara had spoken of his desire to keep Gauld at Tannadice to build on last season’s achievements.

But he admitted the teenage midfielder’s departure from Tayside was inevitable after a ‘life-changing’ bid was received from the club that honed the talents of Real Madrid’s Portuguese winger Cristiano Ronaldo.

‘There comes a time when a bid is too good to turn down, not just financially but for the player himself,’ said McNamara, speaking before the deal was tied up. ‘If it’s the right club, it could be life changing.

‘The initial offer was good enough for us to let Ryan go and speak to them. We’ ll just need to see what happens over the next 24 hours.

‘I wouldn’t be disappointed if he doesn’t go. Looking at it selfishly from a Dundee United point of view, we’d want him to stay and play for us next season.  

‘But, professionally, having been a player myself, you always want people to get a good opportunity. So there are two sides to it.

‘We have said all along that we know the talent we have with Ryan and others. So we’ve known that one day people would come in for them. It was inevitable it would happen.’
