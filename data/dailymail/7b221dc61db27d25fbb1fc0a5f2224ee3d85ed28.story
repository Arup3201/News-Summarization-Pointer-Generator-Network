Drowned: English teacher Sian Marshall-Plewes from Lincoln

A popular British teacher has died while swimming in the sea on holiday in the Dominican Republic.

Sian Louise Marshall-Plewes, 36, from Lincoln, drowned in the luxury holiday resort during the early hours of Saturday morning.

She was an English teacher at the Priory City of Lincoln Academy, in Skellingthorpe Road.

Ms Marshall-Plewes drowned at 4am while swimming with 20-year-old Jose Manuel Cordero, close to the popular Sosua Beach.

She became separated from him after being hit by a 'strong wave', inhaled water and then passed out.

Ms Marshall-Plewes had been staying at an apartment in Calle Llibre for a week.

She was due to fly back to England on Sunday.

It comes seven years after Sian's husband, Mark, died suddenly, aged 30.

It is understood he died at the couple's home.

Tributes have already begun flooding in for Ms Marshall-Plewes.

Former student Danielle Jenkinson, 19, said: 'She was more of a friend and a mother figure than a teacher.

'As pupils we could go to her about anything and everything. That could include any problems outside of school.

'She was the most amazing person and a brilliant teacher.

'She had a fish bowl in her classroom at school and we used to feed the fish every time we started class.

'I will always remember her and everyone will miss her.'

Other pupils and staff today described her as a very popular teacher.

Pauline Mountcastle, who works at the
school three miles south of Lincoln city centre, said: 'Such sad 
news.we will miss you.rip to a lovely lady xxxxx.'

Kaisha Mellars said: 'Sleep tight beautiful, you will be missed by all of us at school. Amazing woman. R.I.P x'

Savannah Purdy said: 'So sad! Going to miss her loads, rest in peace Miss Marshall. Sleep tight up there xxxx.'

A former student of the Lincoln teacher added: 'She was a loved English teacher by all.

'Itâ€™s such a shame this woman drowned while on holiday. My thoughts are with her family and friends.'

This afternoon there was no answer at Sian's new build home in the south of the city close to the school where she worked.

But one neighbour said: 'Sian told me she was planning to pack her bags and go over there for good.

'This is a real tragedy especially if she was about to start a new life.'

'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
