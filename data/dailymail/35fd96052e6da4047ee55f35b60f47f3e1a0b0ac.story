The daughter of Seventies supermodel Christie Brinkley has posted a set of photos on Instagram that reveal the stunning transformation she has undergone in the past year.

Sailor Brinkley Cook, now 15, posted the two pictures on Instagram, with the caption '1 year ago at the same time #lol #transformationtuesday'.

The photos, the first taken in summer 2012 and the second taken exactly a year later, show how much the young girl has come to resemble her mother after losing the puppy fat and 'growing into herself', as she puts it.

Growing up: Left, Sailor in May this year. Right, just one year earlier in 2012

Another pair of photos show her as a slightly awkward-looking nine-year-old in 2007, smiling brightly in 2013.

Set on the same path 
to modelling success as her mother, Sailor is featured in a multiple 
page photoshoot in Teen Vogue this month, which she has posted on her Instagram page,
saying, 'Yay! I did an amazing shoot with #TeenVogue a couple months 
ago for their august issue and it is finally hitting newsstands this 
week! It was such a fun and amazing experience.. Everyone go out and buy
a copy! Thank you soo much'.

She
confesses that despite acquiring a newfound confidence since turning 
15, she sought body image advice from her model mother ahead of the 
shoot.

'I said, "Mom, 
should I diet?" And she was like, "No! You don't need to be skinny, you 
just need to be confident and fit. You shouldn't just be a piece of 
cardboard'.

Grown into herself: Sailor in 2007 at the age of 9, and then six years later in 2013

Christie Brinkley revealed in an interview this week she thought she was 'fat' during her own early days as a model.

The blonde bombshell, 59, shot to fame in the late 1970s on Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue and went on to spend 25 years as the face of CoverGirl.

But while she was admired around the globe for her dazzling good looks, it took her years to find her confidence.

She told the new issue of Haute Living magazine: 'I came across an older picture of me that someone had posted on Facebook and I totally remember squirming and feeling very fat while I was shooting it.'And I look at it now and think, I was actually really thin! How is it possible that I felt so uncomfortable in that body?'

Awkward phase: Looking slightly uncomfortable in 2010 at the age of 12
