A teenage archaeology student on only his second ever dig unearthed the find of a lifetime when he discovered a 1,800-year-old relic.

Undergraduate Alex Kirton, 19, suddenly came across the carved stone head of a possibly Geordie Roman God at the site of an ancient settlement.

The stunning artefact, measuring 8in by 4in, is believed to have been dumped as rubbish when a Roman bath house fell out of use and remained hidden until now.

Ancient setting: The 1,800-year-old carved stone head of a possible Geordie Roman God that was found by archeologists from Durham University at Binchester Roman Fort

Alex, a first year student at Durham University, was helping to excavate the bath house site at Binchester Roman Fort, near Bishop Auckland, Co Durham, when he made the find.

The sandstone head, which dates from the 2nd or 3rd century AD, is likely to represent the war-like Antenociticus, a Celtic god worshipped as a way of inspiring troops about to go into battle.

Alex, who is studying Archaeology and Ancient Civilisations, said: ‘I know that I may be an archaeologist for the rest of my life and never find something this significant again, but it’s incredibly exciting to have been the person who uncovered it.

‘My trowel touched something and as I pulled away the soil I realised I was looking at the back of a head. I could clearly to see the impression of the hair carved into it.

‘I knew I may have found something of 
interest and I called over my supervisor as I thought I ought to let 
someone know what I’d discovered.

‘He came over and between us we carefully cleared away the soil that was surrounding it until all of a sudden the head rolled out face up and was just lying there staring up at us.’

The teenager said he knew his find was a rare one but he realised how special it was when he saw his supervisor’s stunned expression.

‘I was absolutely ecstatic, it seemed such an outrageous piece of luck to come across it on my second dig, but I’m delighted I did,’ he said.

The stone head is believed to date back to the 2nd or 3rd Century AD.

Dr David Petts, archaeology lecturer at Durham University, said it was probably the head of the Roman God.

He said: ‘Antenociticus is one of a number of Gods known only from the northern frontier, a region which seems to have had a number of its own deities.

'It’s possibly a Geordie god, though it could have been worshipped at the other end of the wall.

‘It’s also an excellent insight into the life and beliefs of the civilians living close to the Roman fort. The style is a combination of classical Roman art and more regional Romano-British traditions. It shows the population of the settlement taking classical artistic traditions and making them their own.’

The find was made as part of a five year project at Binchester Roman Fort which is shedding new light on the twilight years of the Roman Empire.

Visitors attending the Binchester Roman Festival on the weekend of July 13/14 will be able to see the head for themselves, along with other objects found during the current excavations.

Binchester - known to the Romans as Vinovia - was established in the later 1st century AD and was once the largest Roman fort in County Durham.
