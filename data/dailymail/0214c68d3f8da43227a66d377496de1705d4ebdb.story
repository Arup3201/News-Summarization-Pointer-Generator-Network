The NSA has revealed that there were at least a dozen employees who used the agency's spying capabilities to secretly eavesdrop on their romantic partners.

The specific cases of employees listening in to their lovers' phone calls come as the investigation into widespread wiretapping and email surveillance by the National Security Agency is examined following the release of classified documents by Edward Snowden.

The names of the federal employees who allegedly ordered these wire taps have not been revealed and six cases have been brought to the Justice Department for evaluation but it seems that none have resulted in criminal prosecution.

Renewed criticism? Revelations about Moalin et al could renew controversy over NSA spying on U.S. citizens and residents and the way data it collects is used

The inspector general of the NSA, George Ellard, sent a letter to Senator Chuck Grassley saying that there were 12 employees who admitted to participating in 'Loveint', the official name for Love Intelligence'.

One of the most egregious instances came when a male intelligence employee who lived and worked abroad used data collection tools to listen to the phone conversations of nine women living outside of the U.S.

The investigation into this man's habits came when one of the women he was having a sexual relationship with suspected that he was listening to her phone conversations.

That woman happened to be foreign-born but working for the American government, so she raised the alarm to one of her federal co-workers.

CNN reports that a different male employee said that he searched for information connected to his phone number and that of his girlfriend 'out of curiosity'.

The whole truth: NSA Director General Keith Alexander testified on Capitol Hill on Thursday as part of an ongoing investigation into widespread abuses of power at his agency

He didn't have the credentials to listen to actual conversations but he looked at the various calls made to and from those numbers.

NBC reports that another man said that he used NSA resources on his first day of work to view emails from his girlfriend's six different addresses but claimed that he did so because he wanted to 'practice on the system'.

Male employees were not the only ones to abuse the system, as one married woman in 2004 admitted that she used the tools to see if her husband was cheating on her after she saw an unknown foreign number in his call log.

There have been no specific firings that came in connection to these cases, though the wife who admitted to looking into her husband resigned before she could be formally dismissed.

Others- like one man who admitted to participating in Loveint during a polygraph exam- faced demotions in pay or rank or recommendations against granting them certain security clearances.
