Vile: Alan Brigden, 67, began sexually abusing boys between 1977 and 1980 at a school in West Sussex before switching to the notorious St George's School, in Norfolk

A second teacher from a top boarding school has been jailed after he sexually assaulted young boys more than 30 years ago.

Alan Brigden, 67, began sexually abusing boys between 1977 and 1980 at a school in West Sussex before switching to the notorious St George’s School, in Norfolk.

Brigden, who had been living in Holland, was extradited in January after police launched an investigation into St George’s school following reports of historic abuse.

The inquiry led to the 
arrest of former headmaster Derek Slade who was eventually jailed for 21
years in 2010 for sexually and physically abusing pupils.

Slade
was found guilty of 50 offences, including possessing pornographic 
images of children on a computer and sexually assaulting young boys.

A
third teacher from the school, Alan Williams, was also arrested last 
year for allegations of sexual abuse but was later found dead at his 
home in Stowmarket, Suffolk.

Police have also suggested more investigations could follow after further allegations of sexual abuse were made against former staff of St George’s, in Stowmarket.

Brigden, who was a maths teacher, admitted four offences of assault with intent to commit a serious sexual offence.

He also admitted four offences of indecency with a boy under the age of 14 and six offences of indecent assault on a boy under the age of 14.

Shockingly, when officers raided Brigden’s Amsterdam home in January they found a pair of PE shorts and school shorts belonging to one of his young victims from over 30 year years ago, a court heard.

Jailing him for five years at Ipswich Crown Court Judge Rupert Overbury said Brigden’s guilty plea had spared his victims from reliving the 'horrors of their childhood' in court.

He said: 'All the offences involved a gross breach of trust.

'The offences were persistent and amount, in my judgment, to a campaign of sexual offending.'

Jan Brewer, prosecuting, said one of 
the 14 offences related to his time in West Sussex, with the remaining 
13 committed while he was working in Norfolk.

The first offence took place in 1977 while Brigden was teaching at Pennthorpe School, in Rudgwick, West Sussex.

'I was a vulnerable child when he came into my life, I already had been subjected to an extraordinary scale of brutality and abuse under the regime of Derek Slade.

'I was an easy target for someone like Brigden, a man who was in a position of responsibility and who was supposed to protect and educate children.

'I cannot relay how much this man manipulated me. I was left to feel everything was my fault, that something was wrong with me.

'I was convinced as a child that telling anybody anything about the abuse would bring nothing but shame, disbelief and trouble to me.

'I was 11 years old, bright, confident and glad to be in the world before I went to St George’s School.

'I hope that now at 43 years I can begin to discover what it might be like to be glad to be in the world once again.'

While there he took his victim to the Lake District, where he groped him and took pictures.

Brigden then left the school and, using the name Morton, began teaching at St George’s School in Wicklewood, Norfolk.

While at St George’s, Brigden befriended an 11 year-old boy and took him on a ten-day train trip around England and Wales, where he sexually assaulted him every night.

Miss Brewer said the boy had not liked what was happening to him and had asked to go home.

She said the situation had been confusing for the victim as Brigden had been nice to him during the day but every night was like 'a bad dream or nightmare'.

Nicholas Bleaney, defending, said Brigden suffered from Parkinson’s disease and there was no evidence he had re-offended in the years following the offences.

After sentencing, one of Bridgen’s victims said in a statement: 'Alan Brigden was a maths teacher at St George’s Boarding School for Boys in Norfolk who had a profound and lasting negative effect on my life.

'I was a vulnerable child when he came into my life, I already had been subjected to an extraordinary scale of brutality and abuse under the regime of Derek Slade.

'I was an easy target for someone like Brigden, a man who was in a position of responsibility and who was supposed to protect and educate children.

'But in fact his motives to place himself in the position were entirely nefarious.

'I cannot relay how much this man manipulated me. I was left to feel everything was my fault, that something was wrong with me.

'I was convinced as a child that telling anybody anything about the abuse would bring nothing but shame, disbelief and trouble to me.

'I was 11 years old, bright, confident and glad to be in the world before I went to St George’s School.

'I hope that now at 43 years I can begin to discover what it might be like to be glad to be in the world once again.'

Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Adrian Randall, of Norfolk Constabulary, said: 'Whilst the conviction and sentencing of Derek Slade was a milestone in this investigation, other allegations have been received relating to St George’s School.

'It is just as important that we get justice for those other victims of abuse.

'One of the offences committed by Brigden happened almost 35 years ago, longer ago than the oldest of Slade’s crimes.

'This, along with the fact that Brigden was living abroad and had become a Dutch national, meant our inquiries were even more complex.

'But today’s result demonstrates that time and borders will not stand in the way of dealing with offenders who may think they have evaded the law.

'I hope that the outcome of today’s hearing is of comfort to those victims who now will not have to relive the traumatic experiences they went through at the hands of Brigden.

'He will never again be allowed to work with children, and will be returned to Holland to serve his sentence.'

Slade, a self-confessed paedophile, abused pupils as young as eight and beat them with a cane, slipper or table tennis bat.

He also held what he called ‘midnight feasts’ where he would sexually abuse the boys, and famously argued on television for corporal punishment in British schools.

Williams, who was a music teacher at the school, was arrested after a number of former pupils made allegations against him.

Prior to his arrest, Williams had been working as the director of music at Ashfold School in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

He was found dead on June 10, 2011.

St George’s school was originally set up as military boarding school by Oxford-educated Slade in 1977 but was moved to the site in Finborough in 1980.

It is now known as the Finborough School and has no links to St George’s.

Slade eventually left in 1983 after escaping other charges made against him following an investigation by BBC Radio 4.
