Nancy Reagan refused to help dying Hollywood star Rock Hudson get a bed at a French hospital at the forefront of experimental treatment for AIDS, it has been claimed.

Then First Lady Mrs Reagan turned down a request from Hudson's publicist for help getting the actor transferred to a French military hospital where he could be seen by Dr Dominique Dormant.

Dr Dormant, who had treated Hudson for AIDS months earlier, was at the time working on an early experimental drug that promised to help bolster the immune systems of AIDS sufferers.

Hudson, who had kept secret his homosexuality and his AIDS, was eventually given a bed at the Percy Military Hospital in Clamart - thanks to strings pulled with French officials.

But in the end it transpired that his condition had deteriorated so badly that even Dr Dormant's experimental HPA-23 treatments could not help him.

He chose to return to Los Angeles and died  just two months later, in October 1985.

One of Hollywood's hottest hunks throughout the 1950s and 1960s, 59-year-old Hudson had grown close to Ronald Reagan, the future president who started out an actor, through showbusiness circles.

But by the mid-1980s Hudson was no longer the broad-shouldered embodiment of 'the American man'. He was frail and gaunt, and one Sunday evening in July 1985 he collapsed in the Paris Ritz, just hours after arriving in the city.

It was a closely guarded secret that Hudson was in the French capital desperately seeking treatment for AIDS, but the doctor he had come to see, Dr Dormant, could not get permission to admit the star to move to the military hospital where he worked, or even to visit him as an outpatient in the American hospital where he was taken after his collapse,  Buzzfeed reports.

Hudson's American publicist Dale Olson sent a desperate telegram to the Reagan White House pleading for help with persuading the French military to allow the actor to be treated, Buzzfeed reports.

'Doctor Dominique Dormant specialist treating Rock Hudson in Paris, reports only one hospital in the world can offer necessary medical treatment to save life of Rock Hudson or at least alleviate his illness. This hospital is Ministere du la Defence Centre d’Researches du Service de Sante des Armees Percy Hospital in the city of Clamart,' said the telegram, discovered in the Reagan Presidential Library and seen by Buzzfeed.

'Commanding general of Percy Hospital has turned down Rock Hudson as a patient because he is not French. Doctor Dormant in Paris believes a request from the White House or a high American official would change his mind. Can you help by having someone call the commanding general’s office at the Percy Hospital at the above number.'

But Mrs Reagan, acting on the advice of deputy press secretary Mark Weinberg, turned down the request.

Mr Weinberg told Buzzfeed he recommended that Mrs Reagan refer to the matter to the U.S. Embassy in France in an effort to be seen to 'be fair and not do anything that would appear to favor personal friends.'

Insisting the decision had nothing to do with AIDS policy, he said the Reagans' view was 'Well, we're so sorry', but the couple 'were about treating everybody the same' and didn't want to make exceptions for friends.

But the decision came at a time of virulent homophobia in the U.S., where conservatives in particular had come to see the AIDS epidemic as a gay plague sent by God as a punishment for homosexuality.

Peter Staley, a prominent activist for AIDS awareness and treatment, told Buzzfeed the Reagans' excuse seemed 'strange', since they often did favours for their friends while in power.

'I’m sure if it had been Bob Hope in that hospital with some rare, incurable cancer, Air Force One would have been dispatched to help save him,' he said.

'There’s no getting around the fact that they left Rock Hudson out to dry. As soon as he had that frightening homosexual disease, he became as unwanted and ignored as the rest of us.'
