A mother is urging young people to think before they ink as she wishes she'd never had a giant tattoo drawn on her chest at the age of 18.

Full-time mother Lissani, 25, from Leeds, bitterly regrets having the colourful diamond with butterfly wings and a crown emblazoned on her cleavage.

She said the tattoo was an act of teenage rebellion following a strict Catholic upbringing but admits  it no longer fits her look or lifestyle.

Act of teenage rebellion: Lissani, 25, now regrets the giant tattoo she had when she was 18 as an act of rebellion against her Catholic upbringing

Speaking on the documentary Bodyshockers, which airs on Channel 4 tonight, she said: 'I was a wild child when I was a teenager but I'm far from that now.

'As soon as I turned 18, I wanted to do what I wanted, I smoked and took drugs. 

'I wanted to be different and stand out so I had the tattoo. At the time I thought it was really cool and was pleased everyone would be able to see it.'

But after getting married and having a son, now three, Lissani said she no longer loves the permanent reminder of her past.

The inking is hard to conceal, as illustrated when Lissani met Bodyshockers presenter Katie Piper to be interviewed for the Channel 4 documentary and it can still be seen above her high neck dress

'When I had my son, that was the nail in the coffin for me,' she explains. 

'Watching him lying on my naked chest by my tattoo, I just wished it wasn't there.'

The tattoo is difficult for Lissani to conceal unless she wears a roll neck top and she often feels like she is being judged when people see it. 

She said: 'People must look at me and think I'm a crazy mum or a bad person.' 

As Lissani's son gets older, she intends to go back to university and then train to be a midwife, but she feels the tattoo could also hold her back in a nursing career.

She said: 'Can you imagine when I walk into the room to help deliver a baby and the first thing they see is my huge tattoo? 

'They will think I'm crazy. Midwives wear a V-neck uniform and it will show.'

Lissani appears on Bodyshockers to urge other young people to carefully consider whether they really want a tattoo and to remember that they will have to live with it forever.

After several rounds of painful laser removal surgery, the tattoo is slowly becoming fainter, much to Lissani's relief

She said of her decision: 'When I had it done when I was 18, I really didn't care about my future. 

'Now I look at myself in the mirror and I hate it. I liked this design seven years ago but now it doesn't mean anything to me.'

Lissani is so desperate to have the mistake erased, she is willing to endure painful laser removal surgery. 

There is no guarantee the treatment will fully work but after two sessions, she can begin to tell the difference as some of the colours and lines are fainter. 

Speaking of the treatment she said: 'It's like having an electric shock.

'People think "If I get a tattoo I don't like, I'll just get it removed" but it's not that simple. 

'I look in the mirror now and get frustrated as it's not completely removed, so now it looks like a very bad tattoo. 

'I just have to keep telling myself - focus, it is going to go and then it will look fab.' 

Bodyshockers: Nips, Tucks and Tattoos is on Channel 4 Wednesdays at 10pm
