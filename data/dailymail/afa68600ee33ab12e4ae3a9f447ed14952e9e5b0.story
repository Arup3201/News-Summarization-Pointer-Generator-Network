An aristocrat is facing a battle with the National Trust and furious locals over plans to build a cable car at one of the most beautiful spots in the south west of England.

The Marquess of Bath, who is said to have acquired as many as 75 ‘wifelets’ to share the romantic side of his eccentric life, wants to install a cable car to encourage tourists to visit picturesque Cheddar Gorge in Somerset.

The 81-year-old owns the southern portion of the gorge but the north belongs to the National Trust, which fiercely opposes the plans, claiming the £10m scheme will 'destroy' the three-mile-long site.

His plan has been hatched in response to a huge decline in visitor numbers to the site over the past four decades.

Epic: Cheddar Gorge in Somerset is ranked among Britain's most beautiful scenery. A company owned by the Marquess of Bath wants to build a cable car at the site, which would look similar to this mock-up above

The plans: The 600m cable car would run from either point A or point B through a small section of the 
three-mile long Cheddar Gorge to the Top Station. Longleat also hopes to build a viewing 
platform and sky bridge at the top

The conservation body's views are echoed by locals, who feel the gorge, which also boasts ancient caves, would be made more vulgar if the cable car was built.

Helen Bonser-Wilton, Assistant Director of Operations at the National Trust, said: 'The National Trust is objecting to the proposal by Longleat Estates to build a cable car in Cheddar Gorge.

'We are working with CPRE and other organisations to drive business in the Gorge without destroying the very asset that people come to see. It is far better to retain the uniqueness of the place.

'We welcome and support the initiative to take a fresh look at how Cheddar Gorge can regain its reputation as a one of the UK top visitor attractions, and would like to play a full and active part in exploring this further.'

The Trust has already denied permission 
for the car to run over its portion of the gorge but has no authority 
over the Lord Bath owns.  However, it is set to lobby local planning authorities over the proposals.

Hugh Cornwell, director of Cheddar Gorge 
and Caves for Lord Bath, said the estate needs paying tourists as it is 
not funded by grants - like the National Trust - and tourist numbers 
have dwindled from 400,000 a year in the 1970s and 80s to just 150,000.

'Visually the cable car is a downside although the visual signature is quite small,' Mr Cornwell said.

He added that the extra income from the cable car will benefit the area as the money can be ploughed into conservation, wildlife protection and maintenance.

However, he admitted some of the income would be profit for the Marquess, who in 2011 had an estimated wealth of £157million.

He continued: 'Longleat Estate share the view that Cheddar Gorge is the finest limestone Gorge in Britain, that it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its rare calcareous grasslands, that it is a Special Area of Conservation for bats, amongst other endangered fauna, and with six caves that are Scheduled Ancient Monuments it is definitely a prehistoric site of national importance.

The 81-year-old marquess of Bath, pictured with long-term mistress Trudi Juggernauth-Sharma, owns the southern portion of the gorge. His representative says the extra revenue will help towards upkeep

'However looking after Cheddar Gorge, and cherishing its values, costs money. The Government, at a time of national austerity, has more immediate calls on Tax Payer funding to provide education, health care and decent pensions for British people, rather than spending money on re-establishing rare grasslands and protecting karst limestone cliffs from erosion. So we have to look to ourselves to earn the money.

'Many local people, directly or indirectly, rely on tourism for their income – just as Longleat Estate does. They also know that Longleat Estate has a long history of re-investing in both tourism facilities, the Museum, the buses, car parking, etc, and in conservation - having spent £2 million in recent years on conserving the 450ft high cliffs.

'Improving the Cheddar Gorge tourism product, for the needs and expectations of the 21 Century visitor, as a means to protect the natural beauty and wildlife of Cheddar Gorge for future generations to enjoy, is what we have been doing and what we want to continue to do.'

Mr Cornwell is planning to make a formal planning application next spring and hopes for it to be operational in spring 2016.
