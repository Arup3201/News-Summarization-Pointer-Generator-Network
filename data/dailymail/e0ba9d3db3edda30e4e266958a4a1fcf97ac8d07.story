The family of a tragic schoolgirl who died of an asthma attack today revealed her organs have been donated to five other children.

Cleo Lloyd, 14, died when her life support machine was turned off - but her family gave permission for her organs to be used in transplant operations.

The schoolgirl's heartbroken mum Fiona, 32, said: 'I made that decision because she always put other people before herself.

A final act of kindness; Cleo Lloyd, 14, a schoolgirl from Anglesey in North Wales died suddenly after suffering an asthma attack. Her organs are being donated to five separate children.

'It is what she would have wanted - she was thoughtful, always smiling, and a bubblygirl with lots if friends'.

Cleo was at her grandparent's home in Valley, Angesey, when she suffered a severe asthma attack.

She managed to call an NHS out-of-hour service who sent an ambulance.

But Cleo suffered a heart attack on the way to hospital and could not be revived.

Her heartbroken family took the agonising decision to turn off her life support machine two days later.

Heartbreak: The popular teenager was described as 'kind' and someone who 'always put others first'

Cleo had been asthmatic since she was two and her family want her story told so people are more aware of the dangers of the common condition.

Her grandmother Val, said: 'People don't take asthma seriously. They should be more aware. It's a shock what asthma can do.'

Hundreds of messages have been posted onto social networking sites in Cleo's memory where she was described as a 'beautiful and kind young woman'.
