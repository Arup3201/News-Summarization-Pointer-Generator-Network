A rare Ming Dynasty wine cup described as the 'holy grail' of Chinese art has sold for £20million - smashing the previous world record price for porcelain.

Liu Yiqian, an 'eccentric' multimillionaire art collector from Shanghai, purchased the white cup at Sotheby's Hong Kong this morning, with those gathered in the auction house breaking into a loud round of applause as the hammer fell on the sale.

The 500-year-old treasure, which measures just 3.1 inches in diameter, is known as a 'chicken cup' due to its decoration of a cockerel and hen tending to their chicks, and is one of only 17 in the world.

Record: The 'chicken cup' sold for £20million at Sotheby's auction house in Hong Kong. It was bought by Liu Yiqian - an art collector from Shanghai who is believed to be China's 200th richest person

'Holy grail': The 500-year-old treasure, which measures just 3.1 inches in diameter, is known as a 'chicken cup' due to its decoration of a cockerel and hen tending to their chicks

Rare: Sotheby's said there were only 17 cups like this one known to exist, with four in private hands and the rest of them in museums

The cup was made during the reign the Ming Chenghua Emperor, who ruled from 1465 to 1487.

'There's no more legendary object in the 
history of Chinese porcelain... This is really the holy grail when it comes to Chinese art,' said Nicholas Chow, Sotheby's deputy 
chairman for Asia.

'Every time a chicken cup comes up on the market, it totally redefines prices in the field of Chinese art,' he added.

The auction house said there were only 17 cups like this one known to exist, with four in private hands and the rest of them in museums.

As the item was so widely coveted, bidding was limited to just a handful of wealthy investors - although the auction house itself was standing-room only for the momentous occasion.

At the moment the cup was hammered down at HK$250millon (£19.3million), the crowd broke into a round of applause.

The total price Liu Yiqian will have to pay for the cup is HK$281million (£21.7million), once Sotheby's commission charge has been taken into account.

Despite the hefty price paid, the porcelain cup actually came in £1.5million below Sotheby's maximum price estimate of £23.1million.

The previous record for Chinese porcelain was set in 2010 when a gourd-shaped Qianlong vase sold for £19.4million.

The 'chicken cup' purchase is just the latest of several records set during spring sales at Sotheby's Hong Kong this year.

The records indicate the region's super-rich are still spending despite fluctuating economic growth.

Wealthy: Dubbed 'the eccentric Mr Liu' by his employees for his habit of wearing T-shirts in the office, Forbes estimates estimates Liu Yiqian's fortune at £540million - making him China's 200th richest person

At Sunday's sale of modern and contemporary Asian art, Asian collectors bought nine of the top 10 most expensive lots.

'Definitely the mood in Hong Kong at this moment, in Asia, is buoyant,' Mr Chow said.

He added that the 'chicken cup' is likely to go on display at the Shanghai museum Liu Yiqian opened with his wife Wang Wei in 2012.

Born into an ordinary working class family in 1963, Liu Yiqian left school aged 14 to help with his mother's handbag manufacturing business.

Working as a taxi driver to help pay the bills, he quickly turned the business into a success by coming up with a way to lower manufacturing costs and sell his bags cheaper than anyone else in Shanghai.

Liu Yiqian became a multimillionaire during communist China's increasing shift towards capitalism in the 1980s and 90s, investing much of that money in art.

Dubbed 'the eccentric Mr Liu' by his employees for his habit of wearing T-shirts in the office, Forbes estimates estimates Liu Yiqian's fortune at £540million - making him China's 200th richest person.

The price of art and antiques in China has soared over the last decade as the country experienced an economic boom.

Thanks to a strong sense of national pride, many of the most desired pieces are Chinese in origin, with works by artists still largely unknown internationally selling for millions.

One piece, a painting by Zeng Fanzhi which re-imagines Leonardo Da Vinci's famous 'Last Supper' in an Asian setting, sold for £13million last year - a Chinese modern art record

Price: This white jade seal, which was carved in 1796 to celebrate Emperor Qianlong's abdication, sold for £3.25million at a Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong

Many of the very highest prices are commanded by ancient items such as Ming Dynasty chicken cups and vases, however.

The previous record for Chinese porcelain was set in 2010 when a Qianlong vase sold for £19.4million.

There has been much talk of Chinese art prices falling following the market slowdown in 2011, but as the sale of the chicken cup today proved, the richest art collectors are still making major purchases.

In fact, Chinese buyers drove Christie's auction house sales up by 14 per cent last year, with the total sale price of £4.27billion a record by any company ever in the art market.
