Experts warn children are becoming less able to pick up traditional motor skills as they spend so much time using iPads and other modern technology

Toddlers these days are barely out of nappies before they are playing with touch-screen toys and fiddling with iPads.

And now, it seems, they are paying the price – because when they arrive at nursery they are apparently struggling to pick up basic fine-motor skills such as holding pencils, pens and crayons.

Some nurseries have installed interactive ‘smartboards’, digital cameras and touch-screen computers to try to expose children to gadgets at an early age.

One of the learning goals in the 
revised Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) is that ‘children recognise 
that a range of technology is used in places such as homes and school’.

Under a section on Understanding the World, youngsters must also find 
out about and ‘identify the uses of everyday technology and use 
information and communication technology (ICT) and programmable toys to 
support their learning’.

Some nurseries have prioritised ICT as a result and ploughed resources into improving their facilities.

Jeff Stanford from Asquith Day Nurseries – which has invested £4million in digital technology – defended the move, saying: ‘It makes children comfortable and familiar with the technology and that is extremely useful when they start school.’

But literacy expert Sue Palmer said: ‘I think what children really need up to the age of seven is real life in real space and real time, which means three-dimensional experiences.

‘We already have problems with children not being able to hold a pen or pencil.

'But we are giving our kids instant gratification all the time with ICT and it makes it harder for them to persevere with something that takes a while to learn.

‘There is a real fear that too much engagement with this quick-fix technology is making it more difficult for some children to learn how to read and write.’

June O’Sullivan, chief executive of the London Early Years Foundation, 
said she is not planning to buy iPads for its 24 nurseries.

While some schools and nurseries plough millions into having the latest technologies, some experts suggest children could do with less exposure to modern gadgets

She said: ‘I know some nurseries are investing in iPads for the children
 but we are not doing that here at the LEYF.

'iPads are the big thing at 
the moment and yet nobody seems to have done much research into them.

‘We know art, music and drama works so why bother with something we don’t know enough about yet?’

And Felicity Marrian, from Iverna Gardens Montessori in London, said: ‘If our children are in fact the most sedentary generation ever, according to the medical authorities, and already spend more time watching television than they do in school, do we really need to add computers and other screen-based devices to the nursery environment?’

A survey of 806 parents and early years staff carried out by website daynurseries.co.uk found that only 26 per cent believed that being exposed to technology actually benefits children in nurseries.

Davina Ludlow, director of daynurseries.co.uk, added: ‘Children are increasingly exposed to an overwhelming amount of technology at an early age.

‘The use of iPads in nurseries, which are displacing the traditional methods of learning and playing activities is concerning.

‘This poll shows that the majority of people clearly want to see early education and childhood play protected from this technological creep.’

Ms Palmer who is also the author of Toxic Childhood added:‘I 
think what children really need up to the age of seven is real life in 
real space and real time, which means three dimensional experiences.
