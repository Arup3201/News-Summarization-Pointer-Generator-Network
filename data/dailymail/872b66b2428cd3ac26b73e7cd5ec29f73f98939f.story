A pensioner's living room was left resembling a demolition site after an out-of-control car smashed though the window as he watched TV inside.

David Hailwood, 66, had been sat next to the window enjoying the Liverpool v Everton match with his housemate when he heard a car speeding across his garden in Llanbrynmair, Wales.

The pair leapt from their seats a split-second before the black Vauxhall Corsa crashed through the wall of the home, shunting the sofa across the room.

He then ran outside and managed to help the driver out of the car, before bringing him indoors and waiting for an ambulance to arrive.

David moved to the sleepy village of Llanbrynmair from Liverpool two-and-a-half years ago

He said: 'I was actually sat on the couch that was under the window that the car came through.

David said the stone cottage had sustained quite a bit of damage and that he thought it would take 'quite a long time' to repair

'It was halfway through the second half of the Liverpool-Everton match, and I was watching it with my friend Linda McConnell, who I rent the house with.

'When I heard the car coming I jumped up and turned round to pull Linda off the couch she was on.

'The car hit the house with a bang, we just jumped up. The couch was shoved across the room.

'I'm extremely lucky to be alive - I'm convinced my late grandmother has been keeping an eye on me.

'The young driver appeared to be walking wounded. He was in pain, but he was moving about. I was too gob-smacked to speak to him.'

David said the stone-built cottage had sustained quite a bit of damage and that he thought it would take 'quite a long time' to repair.

He added: 'Everybody has been around - fire crews, police and ambulance. We're talking quite a long time for the house to be back the way it was.

'We've had the builder out to get props to make it stable, and they will box the front of the house off. The landlord has been getting quotes for the repairs.'

A spokesperson for Dyfed-Powys police added: 'The 26 year old man taken to Bronglais Hospital following a road traffic collision in Llanbrynmair on Monday January 28 was kept in for three days for observation but has since been released.

'Inquiries into the incident are continuing and police appeal for any witnesses to come forward and contact them on 101.'
