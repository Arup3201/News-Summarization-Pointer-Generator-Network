Katrina Taylor was almost decapitated by a piece of metal from a central reservation when she crashed her car

A mother-of-four narrowly cheated death after she was almost decapitated by a piece of metal when she crashed into a dual carriageway barrier.

Katrina Taylor, 34, lost control of her Porsche after hitting standing water at 50mph on the A14 in Northamptonshire and smashed into the central reservation.

The chunk of metal shattered her face, knocking out several teeth and breaking her palate into two pieces.

Another cable broke her nose in several places, broke both cheekbones and damaged her left eye socket - causing her to lose sight in that eye.

It took two hours for Mrs Taylor to 
be cut free from her convertible Boxster following the collision last 
April. She was then taken to Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry where she 
was put into an induced coma for three days.

Doctors
fitted titanium plates into her jaw and skull while her family was told
there was a chance she would be brain damaged when she was woken up 
again.

However, ten
days after the accident Mrs Taylor discharged herself from hospital and
a year later she has made an incredible recovery.

Mrs Taylor, who lives with her four young sons in Desborough, Northamptonshire, spoke of the moment she 'waited to die.'

She said: 'The only bits I don't remember are the actual impact. I remember the car spinning out and I just let go of the wheel and said goodbye to the children in my head.

'There was no point in fighting it, I thought "see you later, I'm a goner". I was waiting to die. The next thing I remember is the paramedic cutting my clothes off and someone holding my head.

'I was put in the ambulance but then they knocked me out because I was choking on my teeth.

'The
firefighters said by rights I should have lost my head and one of the 
officers at the scene said he thought I was going to die. I've had a 
miracle escape. But I had to discharge myself from hospital after 10 
days.

'I have four sons, 
Alfie, nine, Arthur, six, Arnold, three, and Albert, two, and even 
though I was still recovering I had to look after them.

'The doctors had told my mum and my sister to expect that I would be brain-damaged because of the impact.

'I had quite a large wound on my head and because there was front and back impact, they believed I would have brain damage.

'I have done my best to stay in touch with everyone who helped me, all of them have been truly brilliant.'

Facial surgeon Peter Stockton said the seriousness of Katrina's injuries were at the 'upper end' of the spectrum he had seen.

Since then she has gone through three operations to slowly rebuild her face, including a procedure to remove all of her teeth and replace them with a full set of dentures.

She will require more surgery as the head trauma she sustained has also affected her hearing.
