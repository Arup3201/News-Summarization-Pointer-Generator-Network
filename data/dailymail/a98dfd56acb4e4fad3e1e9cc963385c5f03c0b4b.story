If you want to know what it means to have Tiger Woods back and playing at the 143rd Open Championship, then the first tee at Royal Liverpool on Sunday was a pretty good place to start.

Sundays before any major are usually venues of tranquillity before the madness descends.

When world No 1 Adam Scott walked down the opening hole, there were precisely zero spectators accompanying him.

Star attraction: Tiger Woods' decision to play The Open is likely to increase the number of spectators coming

Contrast that scene with the one less 
than an hour later when the masses appeared from nowhere as Tiger, 
dressed in Seve blue, made his entrance and the week heard  its first 
guttural roar: ‘Welcome back, Tiger!’

By
 the time he got to the fourth hole, there must have been 3,000 
spectators happily following his every stroke, many reliving the days 
spent watching his masterclass here in 2006 when he gave one of the 
finest demonstrations of links golf of all time.

Practically everyone else in the field will not have 3,000 people walking around with them next Sunday, never mind this one.

After
 disappointing attendance figures at Muirfield last year, it must have 
gladdened the hearts of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club to see so many 
people.

More than 230,000 
crammed into Hoylake last time, and while there won’t be that many this 
week — there was the novelty element of it being the first Open to be 
staged there since 1967 — you can see why they’re hopeful the 200,000 
barrier will be broken.

What’s
 clear already is Woods’s strategy will not be far removed from the one 
he adopted in 2006, when he used only one driver all week. The years 
might have taken a tumultuous toll, from the series of injuries to the 
divorce to the sex scandal to the blessing of two healthy kids.

But
 off many of the tees it will all start this week like it did back then,
 with a two iron ‘stinger’ to take the fairway bunkers out of play.

The
 first hole was playing into a decent breeze on Sunday, fortifying it 
with sufficient length to lure practically everyone into striking some 
kind of metal wood. Not Woods. He reached straight for the club he might
 well have worn out by the end of the tournament.

How
 did the swing look, in only Tiger’s second tournament back after four 
months out following back surgery? Really good, actually. He was 
swinging about three-quarter pace and looked all the better for it.

Woods
 said he was glad to be back and sounded it. Believe it or not,  he 
couldn’t keep a smile off his  face. ‘Taking baby steps over the past 
four months has paid off and now I am at that point where I can do what I
 want,’ he beamed.

Alongside
 him was world No 5 Matt Kuchar. The American was candid enough to admit
 he thought Tiger ‘crazy’ to make his comeback two weeks ago when he 
missed the halfway cut comfortably in his own tournament and was clearly
 half-fit.

‘Tiger said he 
wanted to test it. Now he’s in the recovery phase  and he said he’s 
getting up the next day after playing and feeling good,’ said Kuchar.

The
 pair had a match going and the personable Kuchar thought it was 
advantage to him with Woods 160 yards away in two on the par five 18th. 
‘Then he stuffed it in close there, so that was a bit of a bummer, but 
more like the Tiger we’re used to seeing,’ he said, smiling.

The pits: Woods' practice partner Matt Kucher insists the US golfer is a contender for The Open

Can
 Tiger contend? ‘Absolutely I think he could,’ said Kuchar. ‘The British
 Open, the knowledge he has, the skill set he has… yeah,  definitely he 
could contend. He was impressive.’

Woods
 joked around on a number of occasions with the third member of his 
group, big-hitting American Gary Woodland. Not such a big hitter on 
this occasion, mind, since the only clubs he was carrying were a sand 
wedge and a putter. The other 12?

‘Stuck in some airport,’ he said. ‘The airline lost my clubs and my luggage.’ It happens to them too, then.

Woods
 arrived on Saturday afternoon and is such a creature of habit that he 
teed off within 10 minutes or so of the time he started his preparations
 in 2006.

hat's entertainment! Whatever the outcome, Toger Woods' return is good for golf

There doesn’t 
seem to be any  realistic hope he will end the week with a similar 
result but it is surely time the analysts laid off with their negative 
carping.

A typical wail is:
 Why didn’t he get competitive reps in at the Scottish Open last week? 
When you think most people didn’t believe we would see him again until 
late in the year, isn’t it acceptable to ease his way back into the heat
 of competition?

Hoylake 
looks a lot different to the parched beauty we saw in 2006 but this is 
down to improved agronomy techniques rather than the weather. In fact, 
R&A chief executive Peter Dawson is hopeful it will play almost as 
fast-running as it did back then come Thursday, while being green 
instead of brown.

Good news for Tiger, then, and his stinger. Good news for golf.
