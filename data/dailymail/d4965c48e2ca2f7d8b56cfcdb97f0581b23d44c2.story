Despair: Amir Khan said hearing the news of the crash was 'utterly heartbreaking'

Boxer Amir Khan has told of his despair for the two young brothers and their aunt who were killed in a Christmas Day crash while travelling to the same wedding.

Adnan Habib, aged 10, and his four-year-old brother Mohammed Arsalaan, died along with 32-year-old Bushra Tazarib on the M6 in Staffordshire.

The red Ford Focus they were passengers in crashed and overturned on the northbound carriageway between junctions 14 and 15.

They were travelling from High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire to a wedding in Greater Manchester when the smash happened.

The mother of the two young boys, 
Parveen, 38, who was driving the car, and their 17-year-old sister Misbah survived and were discharged from hospital yesterday.

All five were on their way to Bolton - where Mr Khan lives - when the tragic accident happened.

Former world champion Mr Khan, a second cousin of the bride, was at the wedding when the news of the crash came through.

He
told the Sun it was 'utterly heartbreaking'.

He added: 'My 
heart goes out to the families of those involved in this terrible 
accident.

'No one could believe it. One minute everyone at the wedding was joyous - the next it had turned into despair.

'Some people actually left the wedding service to pay their respects - and others were in tears.'

The bride, Rabia Khan, is the former world champion's second cousin and he was at the ceremony when the news came through, his father Shah Khan confirmed.

Mr Khan said the family were from the groom's side and that Amir and the rest of the family were very upset to learn of the accident.

He said: 'It shocked everybody. The family is trying to support them.'

The boys' mother and sister left the University Hospital of North 
Staffordshire on Boxing Day.

Friends and extended family of the boys had gathered at a local Islamic centre where prayers were being said.

The children's father was said to be 'inconsolable' at their deaths.

Close
family were still believed to be in the Midlands where they had 
attended a wedding and others are reported to be arriving in the the UK 
from Dubai.

One wedding guest told the Daily Mirror: 'It was kept from the bride and groom for as long as possible.

A 'much-loved' husband and wife who died in a horrific car crash on Christmas Day were on their way to see their two-year-old grandson.

The family of Ann Goodrich, 57, and her husband Paul, 56, said today they are 'absolutely devastated'.

The couple, from Fleet, Hampshire, were pronounced dead after the crash on Odiham Road at Heckfield Heath, near Basingstoke.

In a statement released today, the family said the couple were travelling to see their son Darren and daughter Hannah when the 'tragic, fatal accident' happened.

They said: 'A close-knit family, they were looking forward to also enjoying the day with their grandson, Daniel, aged two.

'Ann and Paul, devoted and much loved parents, will be greatly missed. We are absolutely devastated.'

A 29-year-old man from Farnborough, believed to be the driver of the VW Golf involved, received medical attention at the scene before being taken to hospital with serious injuries. His condition today is unknown.

Officers were called at 10.05am on Christmas Day after a member of the public reported that a car had been involved in a crash.

Hampshire Police said only the Golf was involved in the accident and they continue to appeal for witnesses.

'But someone got a call and it spread around like wildfire. The atmosphere completely changed.'

A family friend said: 'Nobody feels able to comment at this time our concerns are with the survivors at the moment.'

A witness said the maroon Focus appeared to have 
struck a tree beside the hard shoulder before flipping. No other 
vehicles were believed to be involved.

Chief Superintendent Martin Evans 
from Staffordshire police said afterwards that emergency services worked 'seamlessly' in 'very sad and exceptionally difficult circumstances'.

He added: 'Unfortunately the outcome is extremely tragic and our thoughts are with the family of those who have died.'

Police spent 
more than three hours clearing the wreckage, leading to huge tailbacks 
on the motorway.

High Wycombe Police Commander 
Superintendent Gilbert Houalla said: 'Our thoughts are with the family 
and the local policing community in Wycombe will be fully supportive of 
them at this very difficult time.

'We will continue to provide support, as needed, as the investigation into the collision takes place.'

The family have been in contact with specially trained police liaison officers.

The tragic accident was one of several fatal crashes over the Christmas period.

Three adults died in two separate crashes on Christmas Day and three men were killed in an accident on Christmas Eve.

On Boxing Day, two children were flown to hospital following a four-car crash on the A174 near Yearby on Teesside.

A boy, who had suffered head and leg injuries, and a girl were taken to James Cook 
University Hospital, Middlesbrough, and two adults also needed treatment.

A husband and wife also died in a separate Christmas morning crash when the car they were passengers in 
veered off the road near a bend and slammed into trees before 
overturning.

The driver, a young man in his 20s and
believed to be the dead couple’s son, suffered serious chest injuries 
and was taken to hospital following the smash on B3349 Odiham Road at 
Riseley, Berkshire - on the border with Hampshire, near Basingstoke.

The couple were later named as Ann Goodrich, 57, and her 56-year-old husband Paul, from Church Crookham, near Fleet, Hampshire.

Their family today paid tribute to the couple, who were described as 'devoted and much-loved'.

It emerged today the pair were travelling to spend time with their two children and two-year-old grandson.

The single-car accident was seen by a passing motorist who stopped at the scene and raised the alarm shortly after 10am.

Hampshire Police sealed off the road for several hours while they 
investigated the crash.

In a separate Christmas Day crash a  passenger was killed and two others 
were left fighting for their lives when an Audi A6 car containing five 
people crashed in the early hours of Christmas Day morning.

The Audi left the A3102 Bath Road in 
Melksham, Wiltshire, shortly after 3.30am. The road was closed for six 
hours while officers investigated the tragedy.

Four adults and three young children were also injured following a two 
car crash on the M6 Southbound, near Corley Services, at around 7pm.

West Midlands Ambulance Service said both cars were substantially 
damaged and it was fortunate nobody was more seriously injured.

The incident was not related to the earlier accident on the same 
motorway

A West 
Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said a woman in her 30s suffered suspected serious pelvic injuries.

Two young boys and a girl and a man, who were all travelling in the same car, were treated for minor injuries.

The
spokesman said: 'Thankfully, the three children were secured in 
appropriate child safety seats which undoubtedly minimised their 
injuries.'

Ann and Paul Goodrich were on their way to see their two-year-old grandson Daniel when they were fatally injured in the crash

He said two men, both in their 30s, who were travelling in the second car, suffered multiple minor injuries.

He said: 'Both men were transferred to hospital by ambulance, one to George Eliot
Hospital and one to University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire.

'Considering the damage to the vehicles it was fortunate that no one was more seriously injured.'

The dreadful day on the roads came after three men died in a head-on crash on Christmas Eve on the A68 in the east of Scotland.

A Nissan Note flipped over in the accident about a mile and a-half south of Pathhead in Midlothian.

Three horses died and a man was left 
fighting for his life after his car ploughed into the animals that had 
strayed onto A14 at Sproughton, near Ipswich, late on Christmas Eve. The
23-year-old suffered critical head injuries after his hatchback saloon 
was one of four cars that careered into the horses.

A 20-year-old woman who was the 
front-seat passenger in the vehicle was also taken to Ipswich Hospital, 
but her injuries were not believed to be serious.
