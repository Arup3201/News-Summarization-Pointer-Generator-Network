The Clinton Foundation now says it took $500,000 in 2010 from Algeria without notifying the State Department as was required.  Hillary Clinton, left, was serving in President Barack Obama's cabinet at the time while her husband, Bill, right, ran the family charity

A family charity founded by former President Bill Clinton, under scrutiny for accepting millions of dollars in contributions from foreign countries while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department, has admitted to violating an ethics agreement with the United States government.

The Clinton Foundation said it would stop cashing checks from foreign governments it had not previously done business with in 2009 when Hillary became President Barack Obama's secretary of state to avoid any conflicts of interest.

But it now says it took $500,000 in 2010 from Algeria without notifying the State Department as was required. 

Algeria, according to Amnesty International, has a 20-year history of stifling 'basic' human rights and arresting and indefinitely detaining dissidents. 

In her memoir Hard Choices, released last year, Clinton acknowledges that he country has a 'poor human rights record and a relatively closed economy.'

The stated purpose of the money was for disaster relief in Haiti. However, at the time of its donation to the Clinton Foundation, Algeria spent almost as much lobbying the State Department as it sought to build a better relationship with the U.S. government in spite of its human rights record,the Washington Post reports.

The country has not given to the Clinton Foundation since. 

During Clinton's time at State her husband's non-profit, which she has since joined, as well, also took money from the governments of Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Australia, Norway and the Dominican Republic, according to the Post.

Kuwait is listed by Amnesty International as a country where violence against woman runs rampant. 

Qatar, it says, has mostly cleaned up its acts but 'allegations of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment continue to be reported.' It spent $5.3 million lobbying the Obama administration during Clinton's tenure.

Oman has undergone a 'very gradual opening of the political process' in the last several years, Amnesty says. While Clinton was in Obama's cabinet the country's security forces killed at least two protesters during a confrontation and later arrested and cloistered 'dozens' of other government critics, the organization alleges.

A spokesperson for 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. played down the implications of the countries' giving to the Clinton charity, telling the Post the agreement was crafted 'to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. 

Realistically, the spokeswoman, Jennifer Friedman, said, the contract with Clinton went 'above and beyond standard ethics requirements.'

The concerns about the Clinton Foundation's foreign donors is not new. At Clinton's confirmation hearing, then-Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, a Republican, warned that the situation could cause 'potential perception problems' for the U.S. government.

'The Clinton Foundation exists as a temptation for any foreign entity or government that believes it could curry favor through a donation,' he said.

And then-Massachusetts' Sen. John Kerry, now the Secretary of State, said his colleague's questions were 'legitimate.'

'If you are traveling to some country and you meet with the foreign leadership and a week later or two weeks later or three weeks later the president travels there and solicits a donation and they pledge to give at some point in the future but nobody knows, is there an appearance of a conflict?' Kerry asked his predecessor.

The Clinton Foundation's fundraising practices have been called back into question as Hillary actively prepares to enter the next race for the White House.

The charity lifted a self-imposed ban on foreign donations and launched a $250 million endowment drive, receiving money from the likes of Saudi Arabia, once Hillary left her post at the State Department in 2013. 

According to the Wall Street Journal the foundation has also received money from the United Arab Emirates and a Canadian government agency promoting the Keystone XL pipeline. 

The non-profit says it dropped the embargo  to provide 'long-term stability.'

'As with other global charities, we rely on the support of individuals, organizations, corporations and governments who have the shared goal of addressing critical global challenges in a meaningful way,' foundation spokesman Craig Minassian told the Post. 

'When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it goes towards foundation programs that help save lives.'

The charity stopped accepting foreign donations at the request of Obama officials while Hillary was secretary of state, but started again with a $250million endowment drive after she left the post in 2013

In defending itself, the organization, which is run by Bill and Hillary along with daughter Chelsea, said, said it would review its practices if Mrs. Clinton makes a bid for the White House.

'Should Secretary Clinton decide to run for office, we will continue to ensure the foundation's policies and practices regarding support from international partners are appropriate, just as we did when she served as secretary of state,' a spokesperson said. 

The Post found the foundation had raised nearly $2 billion since  it launched in 2001. 

About one-third of the foundation's donations of $1 million or more came from foreign governments or entities based outside the United States, the Post analysis found. 

The charity has since agreed to disclose its donors online and noted in the statement that it has a 'record of transparency that goes above what is required of U.S. charities.' 

Additionally, it says its Clinton Global Initiative has improved the lives of 430 million people in 180 countries since 2005. 

A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Michael Short, said the 'alarming rate at which these contributions are now coming in presents a massive conflict of interest problem.'

The committee's chairman, Reince Priebus, called on the Clinton Foundation to 'immediately' reinstate the ban and return millions of dollars to the foreign governments that have already donated. 

'She's setting an incredibly dangerous precedent,' Priebus said. 'The American people are not about to elect a president in Hillary Clinton who could expose them to the demands of foreign governments because they dumped massive sums of cash into her foundation.'

Longtime Clinton ally Terry McAullife,  the chair of Hillary 2008 presidential campaign and a former head of the Democratic National Committee who is now the governor of Virginia, mocked Clinton's attackers.

'If your criticism ... is that she raised too much money for her charity to help people around the globe, OK, I'll take that,' McAuliffe, a former board member of the foundation, told the Associated Press.

In addition to foreign governments, Clinton's foundation regularly works with Fortune 500 companies and financial firms - some of which have separately paid her upwards of $200,000 to speak at their own conferences.

Among them are Goldman Sachs, HSBC Bank USA, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Monsanto, Procter & Gamble and ExxonMobil.
