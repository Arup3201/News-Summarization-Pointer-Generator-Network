Tragic: Fellow soldiers say the death of David Collins will be felt by the entire armed forces community

The mother of a tragic fusilier stabbed to death while serving in Cyprus has said she 'couldn't be prouder' as her son received a full military funeral today.

David Collins, 18, Chorlton, Manchester, died less than 24 hours before he was due to fly out to Afghanistan with the 2nd Batallion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

Mr Collins was killed after a row with three Britons aged 17, 18 and 19 at the popular Black & White Club, in the resort of Ayia Napa earlier this month.

The infantryman was given first aid but was pronounced dead on arrival at Famagusta General Hospital in nearby Paralimni

A full turnout of fellow servicemen packed into St John's Church in Chorlton where David received full military honours.

Mum Lisa Minott, 37, said the service marked a sad but proud day for her family.

She said: 'We're so proud he's getting full military honours and we're so proud of him.

'The Fusiliers were his brothers-in-arms and he loved serving with them. He lived for the Army and I'm so glad his colleagues are going to be there with us.

'It's been a very difficult time but the support his colleagues and the Army has given to us has been overwhelming.

'He always said the Army was like a family to him and now I understand what he meant.

'He was a fantastic soldier but he was also a fantastic person who knew how to make everyone smile.'

Mourners were invited to make a

build a tribute near the Cyprus army base. 

Fellow Fusilier Luke Smith, 19, said David's
loss has been felt by the entire armed forces community.

He said: 'He loved his work and the boys he worked with, and we loved him in return.

'It's a massive loss to the whole force. We haven't just lost a mate - we've lost a brother, and he'll never be forgotten.'
