To the casual observer of their pitiful batting collapse in the second innings at Old Trafford, India genuinely looked like they had given up on this series.

If that is a harsh assessment on a collection of highly-paid professionals representing their country, they have done little to dispel this impression in the last few days.

It began in the immediate aftermath of their humiliating defeat inside three days at Manchester, when the captain MS Dhoni joked that at least his team would get ‘two extra days to rest’ before the final match at The Oval.

Dhoni is a famously laid back individual, but perhaps it was unwise to make light of this particular predicament. It certainly didn’t go down well with India’s rather hysterical 24-hour TV news channels, which – for the benefit of those who have never seen them - are very much from the Fox News school of journalism.

Relaxed: MS Dhoni and his team have been paintballing during time that could have been spent training

Since then several players have made the pilgrimage to the other Old Trafford to experience the aura of Manchester United, while Virat Kohli (batting average 13.50 in this series) walked on the pitch at Stamford Bridge holding a Chelsea shirt bearing his name before a pre-season friendly this week.

To continue the theme of apparent frivolity, the team has also enjoyed a paintballing session – when it might be thought that extra nets would be a more productive use of their time.

It can only be hoped that outward appearances are entirely deceptive in this case. For while the abject surrenders of the last two Tests are depressingly reminiscent of the two 4-0 whitewashes against England and Australia in 2011-12, India actually go into the final Test of this series with something to play for.

Form Moeen Ali started the series well and has progressed since then, he was in excellent form in the last Test

And they need not look far for inspiration in how to reverse the momentum of the last two games. Going into the third Test it was England who were under fire for regular batting collapses, getting into the losing habit and being led by a captain who preferred setting defensive fields to going for the jugular.

Then Ravindra Jadeja dropped Alastair Cook in the slips when he was on just 15, and England’s Lazarus act began. A 1-0 deficit quickly – and astonishingly easily – became a 2-1 lead for the home team. Two weeks is certainly a long time in international cricket.

There is no magic solution or mystery player India can unveil if they want to emulate their opponents and bring one final twist to this absorbing series. If they are to win this final Test they must do so with the same players who, at times this summer, have looked like little more than village cricketers.

It goes without saying that the first imperative is to avoid another batting capitulation. The batsmen are far better than they have shown in the last two Tests, and it is surely time for the big names to deliver.

Cheteshwar Pujara has at least made starts in most of his innings this summer, and he has mainly been out to outstanding balls or – as in the case of the LBW off Moeen Ali in last visit to the crease - one of the most shocking of the several appalling umpiring decisions in this DRS-less series.

Virat Kohli, however, has no excuses for his dreadful run of form. Almost all of his dismissals have come while fishing without conviction outside off stump. It has not so much been the Corridor of Uncertainty as the Passageway of Utter Perplexity.

Smiles: Jadeja and Kholi share a joke but the last two Tests have been no laughing matter for India

With typically insensitive timing, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has this week nominated Kohli to receive the Padma Shri, one of the country’s highest civilian honours. He would need to score nothing less than a century for this news to appear as anything other than a joke.

To secure an unlikely win, India will have to take 20 wickets. It is a hugely daunting task but they should at least be bolstered by the return from injury of the hero of Lord’s, Ishant Sharma. 

India’s bowling line-up has been chopped and changed several times over the last four games, but it seems obvious that Sharma should be selected alongside Varun Aaron – who showed genuine pace and aggression at Manchester – and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who appears to be running out of steam in this five-match series but may be able to summon up one final effort.

Victory: Ravichandran Ashwin is the most likely source of victory for India at The Oval

In any case, Kumar is crucial to the batting line-up, as is the spinner Ravichandran Ashwin – the only player to bat well in both innings at Old Trafford. 

After the huge clamour for his selection into a previously all-seam attack, he sent down only 14 overs while being out-bowled by Moeen Ali. But he may find the bounce and turn of The Oval – a venue that has often been kind to spinners – more to his liking.

Provided they can post a competitive first innings total, then Ashwin will become the most likely source of a win for India. If they truly want one, that is.
