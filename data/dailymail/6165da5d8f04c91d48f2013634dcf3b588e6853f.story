Visitors arriving in Essex’s county town are met with the proud sign ‘Welcome to Chelmsford, the birthplace of radio’.

It was there, exactly 100 years ago, that Guglielmo Marconi opened the first ever wireless factory, from which he broadcast to the whole world.

But rather than being a source of pride for the residents of Chelmsford - recently upgraded to city status - the building from which the first airwaves sprung has instead become an embarrassment.

The premises now lie in tatters - a pigeon-infested, crumbling graveyard 
of memories.

The Marconi factory in Chelmsford, Essex, the first place to ever broadcast radio 100 years ago, now lies in tatters

There is still no decision on which developer will take a £14m gamble on the site after its previous owners, Ashwell Property Group, collapsed at the start of the recession

Marconi's own office is empty and gloomy, thanks to the bedraggled brown drape hanging in the window.

But a world map showing where his radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly above a grimy mantelpiece.

Earlier this month, 60 
environment, architecture, arts and community representatives from the 
Changing Chelmsford Group toured the historic listed building in New 
Street in the hope of finding a way to salvage its past glory.

Marconi's invention had helped save the lives of more than 700 people on board the Titanic, which sank in April 1912, and orders for maritime wireless equipment were piling up.

In the wake of the disaster, 200 ambassadors and delegates travelled to Chelmsford to praise the pioneer for his vision at the International Telegraphic Conference, and the town's burgeoning future was set.

Octogenarian Terry Heaton, who came from India to work at New Street from 1964 to 1991, was on the tour.

'All the iPads and mobile phones, televisions and computers we have were down to Guglielmo Marconi, who chose Chelmsford as the place to pass his gift to the world,' he said.

'That building has to be saved. I used to work in there days on end. A place like that becomes part of you.

'It is one of the most important places in the modern world, but its present state is a disgrace.'

Marconi needed premises for his new company - somewhere a relatively short distance from London and easily accessible by rail.

Chelmsford proved to be the perfect location.

The first offices he established in Hall Street in 1898 were soon deemed unsuitable for the growing enterprise.

By 1912, the first purpose-built radio factory - the Marconi Works at New Street - ultimately became the company headquarters.

There is still no decision on which developer will take a £14million gamble on the site after its previous owners, Ashwell Property Group, collapsed at the start of the recession, leaving the property in the hands of the administrators Zolfo Cooper.

The Chelmsford Changing group hope the land could become new homes, businesses, art spaces and workshops, either newly-built or in the existing art deco buildings

The factory has been empty since 2008, when one of the successors of the former Marconi Company moved to nearby Basildon, leaving the 1912 building at the mercy of the elements.

The Changing Chelmsford team, linked to the Royal Society of Arts, was allowed into the crumbling premises on Saturday to explore ideas for its future, in the hope of inspiring a new owner with its own vision.

Guglielmo Marconi was born in Bologna, Italy, on April 25, 1874.

As a child, he showed a keen interest in science - and, in his early twenties, began experimenting at his father's country estate at Pontecchio where he managed to send wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles.

A year later, Marconi moved to England where he was introduced to William Preece, the Post Office's engineer-in-chief.

Shortly afterwards, he was granted the world's first patent for a system of wireless telegraphy.

In 1897, he set up The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company Limited, which was renamed Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company Limited in 1900.

He then performed a demonstration to the Italian Government (where wireless signals were sent over 12 miles) - and also established wireless communication between France and England across the English Channel.

Marconi created permanent wireless stations at The Needles, Isle of Wight, at Bournemouth and later at the Haven Hotel, Poole, Dorset.

In 1900, he took out his famous patent No. 7777 for 'tuned or syntonic telegraphy'.

And to prove that wireless waves were not affected by the curvature of the Earth, he used his system for transmitting the first wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St John's, Newfoundland, a distance of 2,100 miles in December that same year.

In 1905, he married the Hon. Beatrice 
O'Brien, daughter of the 14th Baron Inchiquin - but the marriage was 
annulled in 1927.

That year, he married the Countess Bezzi-Scali of 
Rome.

Various other patents followed before he joined the Italian Army in 1914 where he was to reach the rank of navy commander.

In 1923, he revisited his studies of short waves, conducting tests between installations at the Poldhu Station and in his yacht Elettra.

These experiments would give rise to the beam system for long distance communication - used three years later by the British Government to link England and Canada.

In 1932, he set up the world's first microwave radiotelephone link between the Vatican City and the Pope's summer residence.

And in Italy in 1935, he demonstrated the principles of radar.

Marconi received many honours during his lifetime, including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1909, which he shared with Professor Karl Braun - and was awarded the hereditary title of Marchese in 1929.

He died in Rome on July 20, 1937.

The group met at Anglia Ruskin University's Marconi Building down the road, before heading for the damp and disused complex.

It was a far cry from the grand opening in June 1912, when hundreds of world ambassadors and delegates attended the London International Telegraphic Conference after the Titanic disaster.

Marconi was the star in a posse of dignitaries from America, Japan, Thailand, Egypt, and even warring Turkey and Italy, who had travelled to Chelmsford to congratulate him on building the world's new home of radio in less than two months.

Later that day, Marconi even hosted a lavish Savoy Hotel dinner for delegates, including press magnate Lord Northcliffe.

But there are signs of a fight-back.

Yesterday, the windows of the listed building were set to be plastered with giant posters made by a local printing firm, depicting Marconi.

The group's members came up with a range of ideas for phased development of the site.

They hope the land could become new homes, businesses, art spaces and workshops, either newly-built or in the existing art deco buildings.

Professor John Worthington, of the Academy of Urbanism, which financed the day, saw big possibilities for a gallery or theatre in the old Marconi Road power plant.

'It's a marvellous, airy, vibrant space,' he said.

Another suggestion was a restaurant for diners to muse over the city landscape in a new tower block overlooking the Victoria Road rail embankment.

Roger Estop, a Chelmsford City Council architect, who attended in his private capacity as a member of the action group, said: 'We have a completely new opportunity with an open canvas.'

But he warned the audience: 'We are currently dealing with clients who have no feeling for the place; all they want is their money back.'

He added: 'It is true that a previous planning permission allowed for demolition of the building with the wavy roof and the one that looked like an old art deco cinema, and we could not prevent a new developer doing that if he insisted.

'But we hope we can negotiate to get a gradual development that is meaningful to the community, with intelligent re-use of the existing buildings.

'We start next week with the message sent by the posters that the 1912 building is of world importance.'

Changing Chelmsford will meet again to thrash out a policy document to encourage community-minded development of the land.

Marconi Veterans Association's Chris Gardiner said: 'I have a hard-nosed view about this now after so many disappointments.

'The answer is to demolish everything apart from the 1912 building and turn it into housing, like high rise flats and houses that people need and will give the developer return on his investment.

'No developer is going to have money to spare for saving buildings with concrete cancer, but they could rebuild in a style hinting at what was there before.

'Even the 1912 building is compartmentalised so would be costly to open up, and the main walls are single skin, making it a cold winter prospect and costly to heat.

'It may be possible to get a developer to invest in the 1912 building, but not much more.'
