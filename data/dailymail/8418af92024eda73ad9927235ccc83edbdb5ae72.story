It was a morning when her velvet and fur coronation robe might have come in handy.

The February weather looked a tad too bracing for the Queen yesterday, who grimaced as she ventured out in a north-westerly wind and temperatures just above freezing for a service at West Newton Parish Church in Norfolk.

Despite being wrapped up in a dusky pink coat and hat, a white scarf and black gloves, she could not help but shiver as she left the royal car flanked by her husband, Prince Philip.

Frozen: The Queen grimaces as she arrives at church on the Sandringham estate yesterday, where temperatures were just above freezing 

Her Majesty tried to stay warm on her visit to church by wearing a dusky pink coat and hat as well as a floral hat and black gloves 

Well-wishers turned out to greet the Queen with many handing her bunches of flowers as he made her way to Sunday service 

The couple were met by well-wishers as they arrived and afterwards opened a new fire station in King’s Lynn. 

Yesterday’s engagements were the Queen’s last in Norfolk before she and the Duke of Edinburgh leave Sandringham and return to Buckingham Palace next week.

The Queen seemed in lively spirits, opting to walk and talk to her subjects outside the church.

Fellow church-goers offered her bouquets of flowers, which a helpful royal aide held in her arms to give the monarch a free hand.

The Queen talked to the Reverend Canon Jonathan Riviere, who took the service in the Sandringham church.

The Duke of Edinburgh, right, accompanied his wife the Queen, left to the church. They are expected to return from their private royal estate in Norfolk to London next week 

They are expected to return from their private royal estate in Norfolk to London around 6 February, which marks the anniversary of Her Majesty taking the throne.

Meanwhile it has been revealed that Her Majesty has decided against introducing any new dogs to Buckingham Palace.

She no longer replaces the pets as they die and, as she gets older, she is worried about tripping over the small dogs.

It comes after the Queen declined the offer of two puppies from her granddaughter Princess Beatrice.

She asked her grandmother if she would like two of four Norfolk terriers, born to her own dog Ginger last September.

A senior courtier told the Daily Express: 'The Queen thought it was a lovely offer but she politely declined.

The Queen's Corgis have been a regular sight during her reign but she has ruled out introducing any new dogs

The Queen photographed in Windsor Great Park taking snaps of her Corgis in the 1960s 

'The fact is she worries about too many dogs around her feet and the danger she will trip up and hurt herself badly. She is after all 88 and not getting any younger.

'Her corgis are getting on a bit and move along at a sedate speed but a young dog would obviously be very lively and much more active.

'Her main fear is that if she fell and broke her arm or even a leg she would not be able to perform her duties for many weeks if not months, and that would upset her greatly.'
