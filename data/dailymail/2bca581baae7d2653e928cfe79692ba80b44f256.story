Five foolhardy thieves were today jailed for more than three decades after 40 anti-tank mines were stolen from a Ministry of Defence freight train.

The raid was ‘opportunistic’ and the gang of six men soon realised they were ‘out of their depth’ when they discovered they had stolen a stash of powerful explosives in Cheshire, police said.

The munitions - which were fortunately being transported without detonators - were on a train which left Cumbria at around 11.30am on October 24 last year.

Ten packages, each containing four mines, were reported stolen shortly after 7.30am the following day when the train arrived at Didcot, Oxfordshire - and an investigation was launched.

Counter-terrorism officers were sent to various sites along the journey where the train had stopped Investigators searched a site in Dallam near Warrington, Cheshire.

The train had made an unscheduled stop due to a red signal at 12.40am. It had stayed there for 16 minutes. When officers arrived to check the area, they had already been told of damaged fencing.

CCTV footage was examined and showed three figures near to the fencing at 12.51am and a van which drove away at 12.58am, a sentencing hearing at Liverpool Crown Court heard.

At 5pm on October 26, 28 of the 40 missing mines were discovered in undergrowth by a nearby rail embankment.

Information then came in to the police suggesting that Philip Yates from Birkenhead and Michael Hellon from Sheffield may have been involved in the theft.

When officers went to see the two suspects they admitted they knew about the theft but tried to deny their involvement.

They were arrested and Yates drew a map for officers to illustrate where the missing munitions could be found.

At 3.45am on October 29, officers went to an area near Storeton Woods on the Wirral.

There, submerged in water at the bottom of a drain, specially trained Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officers safely recovered 11 of the missing 12 mines.

Further enquiries indicated that the last missing mine was at a garage on Quarry Bank in Birkenhead.

When EOD officers arrived, they confirmed an attempt had been made to dismantle the mine, with explosive materials being cut up with a circular saw into more than a dozen different blocks. Police officers also recovered a handgun and ammunition.

Enquiries showed that Hellon was researching the anti-tank mines as early as October 25, and passing information on to Yates, police said.

Phillip Yates, 29, Kris Black, 23, both from Birkenhead, and David Ian Smith, 30, of Liverpool, all pleaded guilty to theft and possessing explosives.

Merseyside Police Detective
Chief Superintendent Tony Mole said: ‘What started out as an 
opportunistic theft developed into a large-scale, highly challenging 
policing operation and I am glad that those responsible have been 
brought to justice.

‘It is 
clear that Yates, Black and Smith were not carrying out a pre-planned 
raid when they stole the mines, nor did these men have any idea what 
exactly they had managed to get their hands on.

‘Greed and the criminal instinct however took over and instead of walking away, these men stole 12 of the mines regardless.’

Investigation: Explosive debris found on a floor of a garage on Quarry Bank in Birkenhead, which was searched by police, as five opportunistic thieves were jailed

Probe: A garage on Quarry Bank in Birkenhead which was searched by police, as five opportunistic thieves were jailed for more than 30 years after 40 anti-tank mines were stolen from a freight train

He added: ‘When this group of men realised that they were out of their depth there was no attempt to make contact with the authorities, who had launched a major counter-terrorism operation given the hazards associated with the stolen items.

‘The detailed police investigation showed that instead the group were in contact with each other, were together in Birkenhead and were actively trying to make some use of the mines.

‘These were very powerful explosives and these men were not only putting their own lives in danger, they also put others in the North West at risk too.’
