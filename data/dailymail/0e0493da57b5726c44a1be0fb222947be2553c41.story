A careless baggage handler has been caught on camera kicking and throwing luggage at an airport in south-western Russia.

Angry passengers watched from their seats as the employee, standing alone on a vehicle used to transport luggage, casually slammed the bags on top of each other.

A passenger recorded the nearly two-minute video on his mobile phone while the man and off-screen co-workers unloaded bags from a plane at Volgograd International Airport.

The rough employee, who appears disgruntled and is clearly not concerned about the fragility of the passengers’ belongings, was filmed flinging bags of all sizes by their straps or handles.

At one point, the video shows him grabbing two bags and tossing them onto the pile behind him without looking back to see where they landed. 

Another moment shows a large suitcase sliding between the man's legs after it was given a push by an off-screen colleague.

He doesn't seem to care that he is being watched by the plane's occupants while he manhandles their luggage.

The worker used so much force to throw the bags that the vehicle appears to shake at times.

He was reportedly suspended after the video was posted online.

Passengers are now pursuing compensation for damaged suitcases and broken contents, according to reports.
