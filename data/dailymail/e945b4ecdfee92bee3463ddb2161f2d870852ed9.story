Tennis star Eugenie Bouchard has pledged her support to International Polar Bear Day with an Instagram selfie of herself with one of the endangered species.

Each year on February 27 is polar bear awareness day across the world, and ahead of the date the 20-year-old has asked for the support from her Instagram and Twitter followers.

Experts have predicted that up to two thirds of the world's polar bears could disappear by mid-century if the weather in the Arctic continues to get warmer due to climate change, and Bouchard has been eager to highlight that issue, inviting her fans to take part in a #PolarBearSelfie initiative.

Alongside the selfie of her with a polar bear she posted the message: 'It's almost International Polar Bear Day! Time to raise awareness about polar bears and their fragile Arctic home. 

'Share your #PolarBearSelfie, tag & follow me & @cocacola_ca for a chance to win a special prize! You don’t need to find a real polar bear – let's get creative.'

Bouchard visited the Arctic with her sister during the Tennis off-season in November, specifically hoping to see some Polar Bears on her trip.

Since then the Canadian has reached the Australian Open quarter-finals, eventually getting knocked out by Maria Sharapova, while crashing out of the Antwerp Diamond Games tournament in just the second round to Germany’s Mona Barthe last Thursday.
