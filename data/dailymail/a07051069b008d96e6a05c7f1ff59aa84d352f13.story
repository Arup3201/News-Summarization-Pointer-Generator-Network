The European Union has spent £850,000 moving and upgrading a visitor centre even though it only received 50,000 people a year.

In contrast, the Pencil Museum in the Lake District town of Keswick, receives more than 80,000 visitors a year, who pay up to £4.25 a head for entry.

Attendance at the free European Commission Visitor Centre dropped in 2012 by 5 per cent on the previous year.

Upgrade: Relocating and renovating the European Commission Visitor Centre cost taxpayers £853,000 (1million Euros)

Hub: The new visitor centre is based inside the European Commission's Charlemagne Building in Brussels

But despite the decline in numbers, the EU lavished taxpayer's money on relocating the centre to a different Brussels street this spring.

The new centre, which is now opposite the Commission's headquarters, opened in May. 

It sits just half a mile from the European Parliament's Visitor Centre, which opened in 2012 at a cost of nearly £18million. 

But actually visiting the Commission's Visitor Centre is no easy task.

People wanting to go must to book at least 10 weeks in advance using an online application form and go in a group of 15 or more.

No children are allowed as access is limited to people aged 15 and over.

Mrs Yannakoudakis said: 'The EU thinks that it can win over citizens 
with extravagant visitors’ centres such as those hosted by the European 
Commission and the European Parliament.

'The parliament lavished a shameful £18m on its temple of 
EU propaganda and now we learn that a further million Euros has been 
spent on another centre half a mile away.

'The EU needs to rein in the outlandish budget for publicising itself. 
If it buckled down and did a better job, including by cutting back 
waste, it might find it needed less money to spend on hype.'

Success: The Pencil Museum in Cumbria receives more than 80,000 visitors a year - 30,000 more than the European Commission Visitor Centre

Attraction: Visitors pay up to £4.25 a head entry for the Pencil Museum, while the European Commission centre is free

In response to the MEP's written question, Commission Vice-President Viviane Reding said: 'The Visitors’ Centre is an integral part and key instrument of its communication strategy.

'It provides an opportunity for citizens, including high-profile groups and key multipliers, to visit the Commission at its headquarters.

'The Centre aims to give visitors an insight into how the Commission works and also explain its policies and programmes.'

The centre had 50,576 visitors last year, down from 53,245 in 2011.

Pencil Museum manager Alex Farthing said all profits from entry fees go into maintaining the museum.
