He has written 30 books, presented nearly 760 South Bank Shows and fronted more than 600 episodes of Radio 4’s In Our Time.

Yet, even at the age of 74, Melvyn Bragg shows no sign of easing up – because his extraordinary workload is the key to his health.

In a deeply personal interview with Radio Times, he revealed that his workaholism was his salvation, protecting him from the mental breakdowns he suffered as a teenager and after the suicide of his first wife in 1971.

Lord Bragg said: ‘Work. Always. Switching your mind away from examining yourself, doing something satisfying.

‘Also finishing things. Completing all these TV programmes here, I’m elated. Done it!’

The broadcaster recalled that his children once ‘put in a tentative petition’ to be taken abroad on holiday  like their schoolfriends.

He said: ‘They’d heard there was this place called France. “Can we go there, Dad?”’

But the only breaks he enjoys are those at his cottage in his native Cumbria and even there he writes non stop.

Lord Bragg, who joined the BBC as a trainee in 1961, is  currently working on 52 programmes for Sky Arts including the latest series of the South Bank Show and says that he has no plans to retire.

He also says he wants to use his parliamentary status – Labour made him a peer in 1998 – to promote culture.

‘If you look at the creative economy in this country, it’s per capita way bigger than any other in the world,’ he said.

He admitted he had concerns about the Coalition’s support for the arts but added: ‘Looking back on the last 25 to 30 years, it’s par for the course. It’s very odd that philistine governments can do terrific things.

‘For instance, Margaret Thatcher’s government put Channel 4 in place. John Major created the lottery for the arts, which has had a massive effect on culture.’

He ruled out wanting to take the baton from Chris Patten as chairman of the BBC Trust.

He said he had been offered administrative jobs before ‘and I haven’t given it a second thought. I got the job I wanted when I was 22 and I’m not going to give it up now’.

Lord Bragg married French viscountess Lisa Roche in 1961 when she was 21.

At the time of their marriage he did not know she had a history of suicide attempts and, despite extensive therapy,  she killed herself in 1971 by jumping out of a window. They had one child, a daughter.

He told The Guardian in 1998: ‘I could have done things which helped and I did things which harmed. So yes, I feel guilt, I feel remorse.’

By the time of her death, Lord Bragg was estranged from his wife and in 1973 he married Cate Haste. They have a son and a daughter.
