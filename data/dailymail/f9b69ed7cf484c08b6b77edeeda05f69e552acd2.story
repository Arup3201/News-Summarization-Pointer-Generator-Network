Thank heavens Lorna Fitzgerald found fame as an actress - she'd have made her family's life unbearable if she hadn't.

Lorna, who plays Abi Branning in EastEnders, says acting's been her goal ever since she can remember.

'I was every relative's nightmare - I'd perform plays for them,' she says.

Lorna landed her dream role at the age of ten - six years after her ambition began

'At first it's cute, but it would get to the point where Mum would say, "Why don't you go upstairs?" She took me to a theatre show when I was about four, and I was in awe of everyone on stage. So then Mum sent me to an acting school and it went from there.'

And now after eight years in Albert Square she's involved in her biggest storyline to date, as the killer of tragic Lucy Beale is at large - and not even the EastEnders cast know who it is.

But if Lorna did somehow find out, keeping it a secret wouldn't be a problem. For even after learning she'd won her role on the soap when she was only ten, she managed to keep the news from her school friends.

'I was called out of class and my mum told me in front of the head,' recalls Lorna, of the moment she found out she was about to be a major child TV star.

'It blew my mind. EastEnders is so big, and as a ten-year-old it was daunting, but I was so excited. But I couldn't tell my friends for about three months! I liked keeping the secret, though. I kept thinking, "I know something you don't!"'

Lorna says that a highlight of being in EastEnders is working with June Brown who plays her on-screen grandmother - Dot Cotton

After being introduced in 2006 with on-screen dad Max, mum Tanya and older sister Lauren, Lorna, now 18, has gone from strength to strength as Abi.

She's been tipped as 'one to watch' by the critics as her character has enjoyed the ups and downs of the soap roller coaster: Abi's been hit by Deano Wicks's car, watched her parents' marriage unravel, discovered Trina Johnson's dead body, struggled with Lauren's drinking and had an on-off relationship with Jay Brown.

Her hard work was recognised in 2012 when she won the Best Young Performance gong at the British Soap Awards.

And now she's in the thick of the action as the hunt for Lucy Beale's killer continues. 'Anyone could be in the frame for her murder,' says Abi. 'It could be me, but we're all in the dark. That's why there's such a buzz. Everyone wants to find out. The challenge of playing a killer would be great. But then, if it were me, I'd probably have to leave.'

Although relishing her prominent role on the soap, Lorna says she struggled with the attention that comes with being in EastEnders. 'It's fine now I'm used to it, but at first it was scary because I'd be shopping and strangers would say stuff to me,' she admits.

And what's next? 'I love it here. I've been very lucky,' she says. 'But they could say I'm leaving at any time. My dream is to win an Oscar. You never know, I could be the first person to win one in Walford - EastEnders: The Movie!' 

Travel, Asia or South America?  I'd love to visit Thailand. There's a party scene and some culture too.

Fancy restaurant or greasy spoon? Greasy spoon – I don't have nice enough clothes to go to a fancy restaurant. I'm in a tracksuit now!

Drinks, cocktail or wine? I love  a cocktail. I don't like the taste  of alcohol, so the juice masks it.

Film, Sliding Doors or Gladiator? Gladiator is my favourite film. It  has action, fight scenes, a love story – a bit of everything.

Music, dance or pop? I listen to Kiss FM because I like a bit of dance music, but my tastes are quite varied.

Gym or sofa? Sofa. I love slobbing out. I have a gym membership but it doesn't get used very often!
