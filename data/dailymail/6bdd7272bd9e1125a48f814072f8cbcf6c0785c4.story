A piece of cake from the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh - then Princess Elizabeth and Philip Mountbatten - has sold at auction for £560.

This is a small sum compared to a slice of the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge's wedding cake, which raised a staggering £1,917 the first time a slice 
appeared at auction in May 2011.

The boxed fruit slice - snapped up by when the auction ended at around 7pm lat night - was presented in its original Buckingham Palace case dated 20 November 1947. It also came with a compliments slip reading: 'With the best wishes of Their Royal Highnesses The Princess Elizabeth and The Duke of Edinburgh'.

The rare, 65-year-old piece of memorabilia was sold on online auction house
 PFC Auctions alongside another royal lot: a signed letter from a young 
Lady Diana Spencer thanking two girls for their congratulations her upon
 her 1981 engagement to Prince Charles.

Made by McVitie and Price - who also made the chocolate biscuit cake for Prince William’s wedding to Kate Middleton in April 2011 - Queen Elizabeth's wedding cake weighed 500 pounds.

Dubbed the 10,000 mile wedding cake, because the ingredients were donated by the Australian Girl Guides and the rum and brandy came from South Africa, the cake featured four tiers and was nine-foot tall.

Prince Philip cut the cake using his sword and it was then served to 2,000 guests at their reception at Buckingham Palace. One layer was kept until the christening of Prince Charles and another was sent back to Australia by way of thanks.
