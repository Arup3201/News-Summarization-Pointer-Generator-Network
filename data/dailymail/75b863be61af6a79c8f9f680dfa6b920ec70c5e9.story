Police have smashed a human trafficking ring which moved more than 230 people into the UK to claim more than £2million in illegal benefits.

Officers arrested 29 suspects as they gathered for a wedding in Poland while a team from Scotland Yard detained a further two people in London and carried out searches in Birmingham.

The arrests came at the end of a two-year joint investigation involving Scotland Yard, HM Customs and Polish police.

Operation: A team from Scotland Yard worked in conjunction with HM Customs and Polish police to smash a criminal ring which trafficked people into Britain to falsely claim benefits

The gang had promised jobs in Britain to at least 230 people, many with alcohol or mental health problems.

However, once they were brought to the UK they were tricked into signing papers to open bank accounts.

The fraudsters falsely applied for tax credit and other benefits using their victims' details.

They then sent the money back to ringleaders in Poland, leaving the people they had trafficked destitute on the streets of Britain. 

Most of the victims have since returned to Poland where they have been supported by local authorities. 

Officers from Scotland Yard and police forces in Poland searched five addresses in south and east London today for evidence, while colleagues swooped on other gang members in Poland as they gathered for a wedding.

Detective Inspector Kevin Hyland, of the Met's Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command, said: 'These vulnerable victims were trafficked here to be exploited and satisfy the greed of these criminals. 

'They were brought here under the impression they were getting a job but were left with nothing, with many ending up on the street.

'The complex international dimension to this inquiry meant that it was vital to have a close relationship with the Polish authorities, which is why they joined us on this operation today.

'These arrests are the first step in these victims getting justice in their home country and have prevented more money being stolen from the public purse.'

Assistant
Director John Pointing, from HMRC Criminal Investigation London, said: 
'During this operation, HMRC investigated over 230 tax credit awards 
with a value in excess of £2,000,000. 

'We
suspect the claims have been submitted by a criminal gang trafficking 
people who have then acquired their victims' identities to commit fraud 
in the UK.

'The evidence HMRC gathered has played a vital role in the strategic planning of this international investigation and has directly supported the arrest of suspects in Poland and the UK.'

Police Major Monika Sokolowska, of Poland's Central Unit for Trafficking in Human Beings, said: 'This form of trafficking is a new phenomenon in Poland.

'In the past we were used to dealing with cases where people were trafficked for prostitution or for slavery but this new form of trafficking is becoming ever more prevalent.

'This is a big case for us with over 200 statements taken from vulnerable witness who were exploited. 

'These people were trafficked to the UK by criminals and did not receive any of the social benefits that were fraudulently claimed in their name.'
