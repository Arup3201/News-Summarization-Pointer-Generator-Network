Wolfsburg midfielder Kevin De Bruyne was fined £15,000 by the German Football Federation on Monday after calling a ballboy a 'm*****f*****' during his side's 1-1 Bundesliga draw with Eintracht Frankfurt last week.

The unsavory incident occurred in the latter stages of the second half with the visitors trailing 1-0 and chasing the game in search of an equaliser.

German newspaper Bild reported that De Bruyne shouted at the 15-year-old: 'Give me the ball, you m*****f*****,' after he failed to do so before a throw-in.

The 23-year-old's tirade was picked up by a pitchside television microphone during the match.

The Belgium international has since apologised for his actions - insisting that it was all 'in the heat of the moment.'

De Bruyne, who joined the Bundesliga side for £18million from Chelsea last January said he intends to send a signed shirt to the ballboy in question by way of saying sorry, Bild adds.

'So much of what you hear from Bundesliga players is questionable,' said Eintracht's Under-16 coach Jürgen Hickert, who has organised ballboys for the senior team for a decade.

'In spite of their money and success they should be role models. [Wolfsburg sporting director] Klaus Allofs said he is a good boy normally. Then he should talk to him about certain practices.'

Despite his indiscretion, De Bruyne rescued Dieter Hecking's side a point at the Commerzbank-Arena with an 88th minute strike.
