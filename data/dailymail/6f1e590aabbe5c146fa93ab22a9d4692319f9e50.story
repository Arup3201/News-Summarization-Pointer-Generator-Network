Former Everton ace Tim Cahill and Crystal Palace captain Mile Jedinak led Australia in their final training session ahead of the 2015 Asian Cup opener against Kuwait in Melbourne.

Rejuvenating an ageing squad has been Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou's primary focus since taking charge  but his greatest asset remains his oldest player, Cahill.

The New York Red Bulls attacking midfielder stands out in a crowd of relative unknowns on the international stage and his influence on the squad and their results is undoubted.

Cahill scored seven of the 11 goals Australia managed in 2014, including two at the World Cup in Brazil where they won many admirers despite losing group matches to Spain, Holland and Chile.

The 76-cap veteran also delivered a goal of the year contender with his incredible left-footed volley in the 3-2 defeat by the Dutch which took his tally in World Cups to five - the same total as Lionel Messi, Zinedine Zidane and Luis Suarez.

A buoyant figure within the camp, Cahill was often laughing during their session on Thursday and says he's enjoying his football as much as ever ahead of what is likely to be his international swansong. It's also the second favourites' best chance of claiming their first major tournament triumph having been beaten by Japan in extra-time in the final four years ago.

'I feel great. This is a big tournament and I really want to do well in it. I still love the game. I love it the same way I did when I first started playing at Millwall as a 16-year-old,' Cahill told the ABC's Francis Leach. 

Crystal Palace will miss Jedinak (No 15) as the Socceroos captain leads his country on home turf

Bayer Leverkusen's Robbie Kruse (front) will be another danger man for the Aussies, along with Cahill

Crystal Palace and Aussie captain Jedinak is the only Socceroo plying his trade as a regular starter in one of Europe's top leagues, with Leicester's newly signed 42-year-old keeper Mark Schwarzer retired from internationals.

Mark Bresciano, the former Serie A journeyman now playing in Qatar Stars League, is just one year Cahill's junior and a frontrunner to be deployed as one of two No 10's behind a lone striker alongside Tommy Oar (FC Utrecht), Massimo Luongo (Swindon Town) or James Troisi (Zulte Waregem).

Postecoglou's line-up will be an attacking one prepared to be frustrated by a defensive-minded Kuwait side that will sit back and look to catch their more fancied opponents on the break. 

Other weapons at the  former Brisbane Roar manager's disposal include Robbie Kruse, who is on the books at Bayer Leverkusen but is goalless this season in six appearances, mostly off the bench, and powerful Matthew Leckie from Bundesliga 2's FC Ingolstadt 04.

Cahill's laughing now but stresses the importance of the tournament for football in Australia is massive

Club Brugge's Matt Ryan is Postecoglou's preferred keeper, edging out Mitchell Langerak who's played seven times this campaign for Borussia Dortmund, behind a possible back four of Ivan Franjic (Torpedo Moscow), Alex Wilkinson (Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, South Korea), Matthew Spiranovic (Western Sydney Wanderers) and Aziz Behich, who's signed to Turkey's Bursaspor but back at Melbourne City on loan.

In a tough pool that also includes third favourites for the tournament South Korea and Oman, Cahill's ability to manufacture a goal from very little will be a key for the hosts. And the front man will be doing all he can to leave a lasting mark on the game in his home country where football battles rugby league, AFL and rugby union for attention.  

'If you can't understand just how important this tournament is now, then you'll never get it,' he said. 'You see how well Japan and Korea have progressed, Iran also with the way they performed at the World Cup. It's a challenge.'
