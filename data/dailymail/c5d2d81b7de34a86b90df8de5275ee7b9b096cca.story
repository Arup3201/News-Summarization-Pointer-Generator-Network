Police are hunting three thieves who were caught on CCTV stealing a poppy collection box.

The gang walked into the reception of Holiday Inn, West Bromwich, at midday on Wednesday and grabbed the tin on the lobby counter when staff were not looking.

An appeal has been issued for the attack police have branded as 'disresceptful' and 'dishonourable'.

Suspects: Three thieves who are thought to have stolen a poppy collection box from a hotel

Despicable: Police blasted the attack as a dishonour on the memories of the fallen who served our country

Pc Wendy Wright, from West Bromwich police station, said: 'This is a really despicable crime and I am appealing for help to bring these people to justice.

'All monies raised by the yearly poppy appeal go towards providing much needed support for the armed forces and their families.

'This type of crime not only disrespects our armed forces but also disrespects the honour in which they have served our country.'

It is the latest attack in the run up to this year's Remembrance Day, which will be marked by nationwide marches today.

Run up: The Duchess of Cambridge greeted officers gathering donations in High Street Kensington yesterday

Last week a man in Bolton pleaded guilty to outraging public decency for urinating on a box of paper poppies.

A judge branded his actions 'despicable' and the case sparked public outrage.

In a bid to apologise for his actions, 24-year-old Daniel Orrell has spent the time since fundraising for the Royal British Legion.

Yesterday, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge shocked shoppers in London's High Street Kensington by visiting the station's poppy stand, while Strictly Come Dancing celebrities collected donations.

Prince Harry has also taken part in the memorial services by laying poppies in Westminster's field of remembrance with the Duke of Edinburgh.
