Nigel Farage breaks all the political rules to boast about his smoking, drinking and visiting lapdancing clubs.

The Ukip leader has built a reputation for plain-speaking and saying too much which endears him to voters and infuriates his opponents.

But there is one subject he hates discussing: his wife Kirsten Mehr, a ‘stunning’ German-born bond trader who hates the limelight as much as he delights in it.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage loves the limelight, but his German-born wife Kirsten is rarely seen in public

Little is known of Mrs Farage, few photographs exist and she is rarely seen in public: and that’s how Mr Farage would like to keep it.

It is one of the great contradictions of the Ukip leader that while he rails against Europeans ‘coming over here’ and taking the jobs, homes and public services of Brits that he is married to a German who could move here under the rules which he wants to tear up.

He jokes that being married to a foreigner is proof that he loves Europe.

But wisecracks were not enough to get him out of facing difficult questions about why he employs his wife on the taxpayer.

Hamburg-born Kirsten keeps a very low profile and is rarely seen in public. At Ukip conferences, she sits anonymously in the audience.

She and Mr Farage met in Frankfurt in 1996, while he was travelling on business - and still married to his first wife, Grainne, the mother of his eldest two children.

Of the moment he met Kirsten, he once said: ‘She was a stunning government bond broker whose brisk efficiency at first sight belied her ethereal appearance.

'She could have stepped into a pre-Raphaelite painting no questions asked.’

Mr Farage was challenged about employing his wife Kirsten during a walkabout in Sheffield

Later, he explained in typically flamboyant style: ‘My marriage, which had been on ice and torpid with its claws bound for so long we had both forgotten it was alive at all, finally expired.’

The couple divorced in 1997 and Mr Farage married Kirsten in 1999.

Kirsten, gave up her career in the City, where she worked as an interpreter for a German bank, to look after the children - she and Mr Farage have two - and take her husband’s correspondence.

She writes all his emails because he dislikes using computers.

She is paid a salary by the European Parliament of more than £27,000 and has amassed more than £200,000 since she began working for him.

She works from home and rarely visits Ukip’s HQ in London’s Mayfair, which she has described as a ‘freak show’.

Yesterday the arrangement caught up with him, as he made the bizarre claim that no Brit could do that job, ‘unless they were married to me'.

‘I don’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day,’ he said. 

Mr Farage said his wife earned a ‘very modest’ wage and worked ‘extremely unsociable hours’ for ‘up to’ seven days a week. 

Former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire accused Mr Farage in the European Parliament of paying both his wife and 'former mistress' Annabelle Fuller using taxpayers' money. Mr Farage denies having an affair with Miss Fuller

In
 2005 there were reports of a seven times-a-night tryst with a Latvian 
woman in Liga, which led to Uki colleagues presenting him with a can of 
7UP to celebrate.

He has at 
times dismissed the claims as ‘nonsense’ but in his memoirs recalled the
 encounter: ‘I met her in a pub and accepted her invitation home for a 
drink. She was sleek and seductive and I will not splutter that after 
the first bottle I would necessarily have behaved like Sir Galahad.’

MEP Godfrey Bloom, Mr Farage's Brussels flatmate, has claimed the Ukip leader's weakness is women

Then
 last month former Ukip MEP Nikki Sinclaire challenged the Ukip leader 
in the European Parliament over claims he employs both his wife and 
‘former mistress’ Annabelle Fuller on the taxpayer.

Both Mr Farage and Ms Fuller, a Ukip press aide, deny they had an affair.

Mr Farage dismissed the claims as ‘absolute nonsense’.

Kirsten is said to be ‘pretty cheesed off’ about the claims. In a rare appearance in public  she told reporters outside the family’s large semi-detached home near Westerham, Kent: 'Nigel's just on his way back from Strasbourg and we will be discussing it tonight, I'm sure.’

In an interview after the claims emerged, Mr Farage gave his own account.

Asked if he had sex with Ms Fuller, he replied: ‘I don’t think we should go into the grisly details.’

Has he slept with her? ‘No.’ Has he kissed her? ‘No. When you work in a tight team, I understand why people might get the wrong idea.’

It did not help that days earlier Godfrey Bloom, his Brussels flatmate and former Ukip colleague, had declared in characteristically colourful language: ‘We all have our foibles and our weaknesses – mine is real ale, I’ve never been partial to crumpet.

'Nigel’s is women. It’s not something he ever denied.’

In fact, Kirsten is said to have played a part in Mr Bloom being kicked out of the party.

She was in the room at a Ukip conference fringe event for women when Mr Bloom famously described guests as ‘sluts’.

She is said to have been unimpressed, and hours later Mr Bloom was suspended from the party for upstaging Mr Farage’s keynote speech.

In Ukip the focus must be on the leader at all times, and the attention on his long-suffering wife will be making for uncomfortable reading for them both.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage was put on the spot about whether his German wife had taken a job which could have gone to a Brit.

BBC political editor Nick Robinson challenged him to explain why he employed Kirsten as a secretary on a taxpayer-funded salary from Brussels.

Mr Farage insisted that 'nobody else could do that job', which included checking emails for him at midnight.

‘I don’t think anybody else would want to be in my house at midnight going through emails and getting me briefed for the next day,' he said.

But a fake advert for a similar role placed by an employment agency on its website attracted 764 applications in just 12 hours - 649 of them from UK nationals.Headed 'PA Wanted For Top European Politician', it stipulated that applicants 'must be able to work long and some unsociable hours up to seven days a week' and described the pay as 'modest'.

It identified the employer as Ukip, which it described as 'a Eurosceptic right-wing populist political party in the United Kingdom'.

Rhys Maddock, director of Xpat Jobs, said: 'With our knowledge of the UK and European employment market, we just knew that what Farage was saying was not true.

'There are lots of highly-qualified PAs looking for work and many would jump at the chance to work for a politician such as Farage, perhaps seeing it as a stepping stone to a similar role with MPs or ministers.

Asked whether a British person could take the position as his secretary, Mr Farage insisted: ‘Nobody else could do that job, not unless they were married to me.’

Mr Farage said his wife earned a ‘very modest’ wage and worked ‘extremely unsociable hours’ for ‘up to’ seven days a week.
