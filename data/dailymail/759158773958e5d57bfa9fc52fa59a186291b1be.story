An Australian skier has told of the terrifying moment he was buried during an avalanche while skiing in the Swiss alps.

James Mort, from Sydney, was with his Australian friends Andrew Sebesfi and Daniel O'Sullivan when the incident happened on January 30.

The rescue of Mr Mort was captured on a GoPro camera as well as the moment the avalanche hit at Les Crosets on the Swiss-French border.

James Mort has told of the terrifying moment he was buried alive in an avalanche while skiing

The Sydney man penned a blog post about his experience, saying he wanted to raise more awareness of the dangers of an avalanche

On his Tumblr, the Australian wrote he had tried to outrun it by skiing over the top of a frozen creek, but was unsuccessful.

'I looked up just in time to watch the avalanche envelope me,' Mr Mort said.

'The last thing I managed to do before I was completely buried was to reach as high as I could above the snow with my left arm and ski pole.'

It was this decision that saved Mr Mort's life and helped his friends locate him.

He wrote on his blog he found the whole experience terrifying, saying he thought he was going to die

In video of the incident, Mr Sebesfi, Mr O'Sullivan and a third friend, Swiss man Léonard Ottensmeyer, were unaware of his whereabouts until they find a ski pole sticking out of the snow, which Mr Mort starts waving while buried underneath.

His friends call out to him and tell him they were going to get him out.

One of them starts to dig through the snow with a portable shovel they have attached to their backpack.

His friends found him when he was able to wave his ski pole from underneath the snow to alert them to his location

The avalanche that buried him happened on January 30 while he was skiing with three other people, including two Australians

But Mr Mort shares what he was thinking before he was saved.

'As the snow piled higher and higher, it became darker and darker until I was surrounded by an eerie black silence, broken only by the sound of my slow breathing and racing heartbeat,' he wrote.

'"Okay" I thought to myself; "You’re dead".

'I was convinced that they would not find me in time. Unable to move I focused on slowing my breathing, relaxing and conserving oxygen.' 

Mr Mort describes the relief he felt when he was finally able to see the sky again.

'Soon my vision became brighter and I heard some muffled voices, then suddenly everything went white as Dan and Leonard excavated my face... I cried with happiness and relief,' he wrote.

Mr Mort said he wanted to tell his story to raise awareness of how dangerous avalanches could be.
