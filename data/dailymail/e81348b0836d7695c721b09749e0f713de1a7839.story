A debut goal from Ipswich loanee Frank Nouble gave Coventry the perfect start to life back at the Ricoh Arena.

The Sky Blues were playing their first game at their home stadium since April 2013, following a dispute between the stadium's operators Arena Coventry Limited and the club owners Sisu.

The Sky Blues were playing their first game at their home stadium since April 2013, following a dispute between the stadium's operators Arena Coventry Limited and the club owners Sisu.

The club have been playing 35 miles away in Northampton, prompting fans to boycott 'home' games, but they flocked back to the stadium as the first team football returned to Coventry. 

Decisive: Frank Nouble scored after nine and a half minutes on debut to celebrate Coventry's Ricoh return

No place like home: Sky Blues fans were delighted to be back playing games in their home city 

Coventry: Allsop, Willis, Webster, Johnson, O'Brien, Clarke, Fleck, Thomas, Thomas, Haynes, Tudgay, Tudgay, Nouble, Nouble.

Subs: Hines, Burge, Pugh, McQuoid, Coulibaly, Phillips, Finch.

Gillingham: Bywater, Davies, Davies, Egan, Hause, Martin, McGlashan, McGlashan, Hessenthaler, Dack, Aaron Morris, Dickenson, Dickenson, McDonald. 

Subs: Fish, Glenn Morris, German, Linganzi, Pritchard, McKain, Norris.

Referee: Keith Stroud (Hampshire)

A massive attendance of 27,306 fans flooded the Ricoh Arena, forcing kick-off to be delayed by 15 minutes as the club tried to ensure everyone could get in.

And those who were part of the sell-out crowd were rewarded early on, as Steven Pressley's side responded brilliantly to the home support.

James O'Brien's acrobatic volley in the sixth minute may have lacked power and accuracy, but the attempt, and the football that preceded it, demonstrated purpose, ambition and quality down the Coventry left, and was a sign of things to come.

Four minutes later Nouble put Pressley's side ahead. Again the move came from the left hand side, Ryan Haynes getting in behind before cutting the ball back to the former West Ham forwrard, who sidefooted home from eight yards.

At the other end Ryan Allsop was rarely worked in the first 45 minutes, although Haynes almost deflected a cross into his own net on the stroke of half time.  

Many happy returns: Many fans had refused to attend home games during the club's absence from the city

Good to be back: Scarves celebrating the return from Northampton were sold outside the Ricoh Arena

Feeling sky blue: Gillingham were unable to cope with a Coventry side lifted by their huge support

After the break Coventry were again on top, and Nouble almost turned provider for John Fleck on 48 minutes, but the Scot couldn't make a good enough connection from five yards.

Gillingham were still on the back foot, but they began to create chances as the game wore on, Kortney Hause heading over from a corner, and Jermaine McGlashan bursting past the Coventry defence into the box, before a poor decision to pass instead of shooting ended the attack.

Coventry were still the better side however, and on 65 minutes they almost doubled their advantage, Fleck's audatious attempt from 40 yards out on the touchline kept out by a combination of keeper and crossbar. 

With fifteen minutes to go Pressley's men were almost made to pay for failing to turn their chances into goals. A free-kick from the left hand side found the head of John Egan but, under no pressure, he headed well wide.

Proud return: In the end it was over 27,000 fans who packed into the Ricoh Arena to watch Coventry win

And, as Pressley and the bumper-crowd, began to show their nerves, Gillingham sensed they might leave Coventry's party with a share of the spoils.

Cody McDonald could have earned his side a point, but he fired a difficult volley into the side-netting five minutes from time. Had it gone in, it would have been a strike worthy of a point. 

Then, in the final seconds Allsop allowed a cross to bobble along the six-yard box, but no-one in a red shirt could turn it home. 

In the end though, Coventry held on for their victory. Given the pain of the last seventeen months, you couldn't begrudge their happy fans their three precious points.

Pressley was clearly proud of the victory and believes the return has finally given the club a platform to progress.

He said: 'I said all along I have huge sympathy for the supporters because clubs are built around them. The return in many respects shows their value to a club. They voted with their feet and forced the club to where it truly belonged.

'I hope it's not a false dawn. We have so much work ahead of us. I think we have given people hope and that's vital.

'It was an outstanding night and I was exceptionally proud to be the manager of the club, we showed our true potential.

'I'm pleased with the result because I have seen many of these scripts before, when we turn up in numbers and everyone expects us to win and we end up with egg on our face.'
