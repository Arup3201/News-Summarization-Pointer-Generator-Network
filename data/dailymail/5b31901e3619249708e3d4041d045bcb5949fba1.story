The fitness instructor  landed on her face and was left with cuts and bruises (pictured) after a 'small blue vehicle' ploughed into her while she was out cycling on Christmas Eve

The fitness instructor had stopped to take photographs of the scenery with her friend Helen Birch-Machin when the incident unfolded.

She was then hit by what she describes as a 'small blue vehicle' and was knocked unconscious.

She said: 'I'm lucky to be alive. If it wasn't for my helmet I wouldn't be here.

'I can't believe the driver left the scene, they probably don't realise the damage they've done.'

After the crash, Ms Taylor was rushed to Macclesfield Hospital. She needed nine stitches but was discharged in time to spend Christmas with her son.

She said: 'My face was covered in mud and my helmet was smashed to pieces.

'I kept drifting in and out of consciousness and I don't even remember much of Christmas because I felt so drugged-up. 

'I've no idea how long it will be until I can go back to work and, because I'm a self-employed fitness instructor, I won't get any sick pay. It's turned my world upside down.'

She was treated at Macclesfield hospital where she had to have nine stitches for her injuries 

The keen cyclist also suffered cuts and bruises to her legs (left and right) but was discharged from hospital in time for Christmas with her son 

She added: 'It's all a bit of a blur. I was pretty out of it on morphine. I've not even had time to think about my facial injuries, it's all happened so quickly.

'All I can remember is worrying about being home for Christmas. The fact that I'd been in an accident didn't sink in straight away.' 

Staffordshire Police are appealing for witnesses following the collision.

A spokesman said: 'Relevant CCTV footage has been examined and house-to-house inquiries in the locality have been made.

'The cyclist is now recovering at home having received hospital treatment.'
