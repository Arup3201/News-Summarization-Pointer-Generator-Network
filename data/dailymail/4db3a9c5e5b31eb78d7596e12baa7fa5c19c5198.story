It is a central London pied-a-terre with a price tag that only the world's richest can afford to pay. A lavish apartment at the Candy & Candy development One Hyde Park has come up for sale - one of only a handful of properties in the billionaire-friendly block to reach the open market - and it could be yours for a cool £65m.

The five-bedroom flat, described on property finding website zoopla.co.uk as 'exceptional', has magnificent panoramic views of Hyde Park and Knightsbridge and has been fitted out to the highest specifications.

Apartment C.08.1, marketed by luxury estate agents Aylesford & Co, appeared on zoopla four days ago and is already attracting a flurry of interest.

In the literature, the apartment is said to stretch out across the entire floor plate of 'pavilion C', on the 8th floor, enjoying some of the city's finest views from picture windows running the length of the property.

In addition to the five bedrooms, there are six bathrooms and three extensive reception areas.

'The interior design of Apartment C.08.1 responds both to its unique size of over 9,000 sq ft as well as its extraordinary location,' the description reads.

It goes on to detail how the apartment is divided into two wings, with five bedrooms found in the city wing, and all living and entertaining spaces found in the park wing.

An 'impressive' 65m hallway stretches from the park side to the city side, connecting both wings and forming the so-called 'spine' of the apartment.

The apartment was decorated by the Candy & Candy interior design team and is said to have taken inspiration from 'the two diverse perspectives of London, which uniquely combine in this apartment, to provide a truly modern interpretation of sophisticated and luxurious city living.'

The property has reportedly already attracted a number of interested parties from across the globe since going up on Aylesford & Co's website at the end of last week.

When contacted, Aylesford & Co preferred not to comment on the sale of the property, saying only that they had received a number of inquiries. They would not be drawn on the price, nor on the apartment's potential to be sold for more or less than the asking price.

Comfort: With three reception rooms, there is no shortage of places for the eventual buyer of the apartment to entertain

They would say only that it is 'early days' for the sale of the property, and that they were expecting 'a lot of interest'.

But while there will be many eager to catch a glimpse of the interior of the opulent development, industry insiders told MailOnline that there will likely be some system in place at Aylesford & Co to prevent the curious carpet-treader from gaining entry just to have a look around.

Agencies who have previously represented properties at One Hyde Park agencies have requested proof that any interested party should be able to afford the purchase of the property. It is likely that Aylesford & Co will use a similar system.

'Other agencies who've marketed properties in the building have demanded financial paperwork to stop rubber-neckers getting in. There are so many people who just want to have a look but have no intention of buying, and the other residents at the development are incredibly private people, and some of the world's wealthiest,' they told us.

While they refused to confirm details, Aylesford & Co agreed they would be likely to operate some sort of system to ensure that only those with the means to live in One Hyde Park would be shown around the property.

The buyer will join a roll call of billionaire residents, including developer Christian Candy, who owns two properties at One Hyde Park. The property tycoon, who built the apartments with his brother Nick, owns two separate flats worth £31m and £26.2m on the 10th floor.

Two other apartments were sold for a combined £136 million to Ukrainian mining tycoon Rinat Akhmetov, who is thought to be investing a further £50 million to knock the properties together and refit them.

Despite being owned by some of the richest people in the world, the flats qualify for lower council tax than people living in an average Band D property because Westminster Council has one of the lowest property valuations in the country.

Indeed, with many of the buyers never intending to live at the address, it was reported last year that just nine out of the 62 flats sold in
One Hyde Park - the world's most expensive residential block - had been 
registered for council tax. Council records revealed last year that only four owners in the block were paying the full council tax of £755.60 a year, plus £619.64 to the Greater London Authority.

A further five were reported to be paying the 50 per cent discounted 
council tax owed on a second home, making a considerable saving that 
will no doubt boost their already impressive wealth.

But with so many of the building's residents based elsewhere, the place has earned 
something of a reputation as a ghost town.
