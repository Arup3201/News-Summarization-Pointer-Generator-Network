Tragedy: Physics student Matthew Satterthwaite was battling with depression

A coroner has urged the sale of helium to be regulated after the son of a top university professor suffocated himself to death with the gas.

Physics student Matthew Satterthwaite, 23, had been battling depression after struggling to settle at the prestigious Royal Holloway college of the University of London,

The coroner at the inquest into his death said he would 
write to Theresa May, the Home Secretary, urging her to introduce restrictions on the sale of helium so similar deaths would be avoided in the future.

While his mother, Professor Diana Mitlin, was away on academic business in Africa, Matthew  placed an order for the gas.

He was was found dead in the bedroom of his family’s £250,000 Victorian townhouse in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.

His cousin became worried when he failed to reply to calls, emails and text messages.

A note found near Matthew read: 'I can’t take this anymore. It’s been years since I instigated anything.'

It also emerged Matthew was identified as being a suicide risk by a psychiatrist whilst living in student accommodation in London, but the details were not transferred back to Manchester where he was referred to a GP.

But he dropped out twice and saw a psychiatrist in London before returning to his family home where he began counselling for depression.

Despite his illness, he took up driving lessons and learnt Swahili ahead of a trip to Tanzania where he planned to help teach physics to young African students.

Tragedy struck in September last year after Matthew’s mother, who is a Professor of Global Urbanism at Manchester University, went on a work expedition to Zambia and South Africa.

His family described him as the: 'Kindest and most loving spirit with a wicked sense of humour.'

Professor Mitlin, 53, the former 
director and chair of the UK charity Homeless International, told the 
Manchester hearing: 'He wanted to go to Tanzania with a person who was 
teaching physics but he wanted to learn to drive before he went because 
he thought it would be less of a burden.

'About
 the end of May he started learning to drive and started learning 
Swahili. He passed his driving theory in July and had the practical test
 booked up for October and he was talking about going to Tanzania after 
that.

'But he was 
anxious about struggling with depression and not doing very much didn’t 
help that. I wanted him to go sooner but he wanted to pass his test.'

She added: 'It’s difficult to say what he was feeling at certain times because I had some sense he was trying to mislead me and he didn’t want me to think he was depressive or suicidal.

'I had no idea he had helium in his room but even if I did I wouldn’t have connected it with a suicide attempt anyway. I’ve never done physics so I wouldn’t know.

'We were going to go to Anglesey for a couple of days so he could practice his driving and he was looking forward to it.'

Professor Mitlin said that in hindsight she believes that Matthew was trying out activities 'one last time.'

She said: 'He wanted to go to a Thai restaurant we were keen on. Looking back on it he was conscious about wanting to do certain things.

'Now it seems strange that having been identified by his psychiatrist as suicidal to then be started again at the beginning when he got back to Manchester.

Family home: He was was found dead in the bedroom of his family's £250,000 Victorian townhouse in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester.

'Why doesn’t one psychiatrist’s office refer him to a similar department? I think if the NHS had referred him to a similar department and he didn’t feel like he was going back to the start I think he would have presented differently.'

Detective Sergeant Richard Thompson of Greater Manchester Police said the note Matthew wrote was found in between documents on his desk. He said police weren’t able to ascertain when the note was written or whether it was directly connected to the death.

Recording a verdict of suicide Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said of Matthew: 'He was clearly a very intelligent young boy with a scientist background and it is inevitable he would understand the consequences of what he did.

'If Matthew really had a better understanding of the grief and heartache he would leave behind I am sure he would have thought more than once about this. But he is an adult and he didn’t suffer from any diagnosable mental illness. He has made a choice.

'Losing one’s own child is the greatest burden of grief any one of us will have to manage. I propose to write to the Home Secretary and point out this is another case which involves the use of helium.'

Addressing Professor Mitlin’s concerns over the transferral of documents between mental health institutions nationwide, Manchester Coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'This is a big issue because people can’t get the records.

'There is no national database. It doesn’t exist. I can write to the trust and explain this concern which is something I’m going to do.'
