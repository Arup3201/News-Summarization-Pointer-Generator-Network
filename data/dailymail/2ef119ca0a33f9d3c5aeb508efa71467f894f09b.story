These terrifying images show a group of holiday caravans dangling on a cliff edge above a 200ft drop.

The mobile homes at the Porthkerry Leisure Park, near Barry, in the Vale of Glamorgan, are now being moved from the dangerous positions amid fears that a landslip may cause them to plummet to the beach below. 

In 2011 owners and holidaymakers had to be evacuated after part of the cliff collapsed, causing 34,400 tonnes of rock to spill onto the beach below.

Dangling precariously: The caravans at Porthkerry Leisure Park in Barry are hanging 200ft above the beach

Precaution: The homes were left teetering on the edge when part of the cliff collapsed in 2011, they will now be repositioned because geologists fear more of the land could fall away

One woman was nearly killed when the ground underneath her suddenly gave way. 

After a detailed investigation, the caravans were repositioned in a safe location near the cliff edge. But now they will be moved back again after a geologist detected ground movement.

Site co-owner Sally Edwards said: 'It could be nothing, but we're not risking people's lives.'

Since then, warning signs have been put up on site and regular checks are undertaken by a geologist.

Ms Edwards said a 15mm (0.6in) movement in the ground was detected in the last inspection.

She said: 'There has been nothing for two and a half years, but we, as a company, feel that we are just not prepared to take any risks and so we are being proactive and shutting the road down.

Dangerous: Geologists detected land movement at the site, prompting the owners to take drastic action

'It could be something, it could be nothing. It could be two years, it could be 20 years, but we are not prepared to take that risk so we are

moving the caravans away from the edge and repositioning.'

Work on removing the caravans and closing down part of the site will begin today.

Ms Edwards, co-owner of the site for the last 16 years, said about £1m had been spent on monitoring and equipment.

With the latest changes, she said about 25 per cent of the leisure site park had been lost.

Aftermath: A terrifying aerial shot of the park in 2011 shows how two caravans had to be moved following the landslip, which saw 34,000 tonnes of rock spill onto the beach below

Reaction: Around 25 per cent of the park has been lost to the ground below since the first incident in 2011

Warning signs: The land movement has been threatening the residents in the holiday park in the last three years

She said caravan owners would be offered an alternative pitch on site, or a refund for the remaining site fees for this year.

One caravan owner, who returned from holiday to find the area around her caravan cordoned off, said: 'Many of my belongings are in the caravan and now I cannot get to them.

'I don't know what might happen to them. Some caravan owners have food in the fridges and they are concerned what will happen to that.'

The owner, who asked not to be named but lives in Cardiff, said: 'We have not been told what will happened or where we will be put.'

She said she and other owners would be at the site today hoping to talk to the owners.

Encroaching: Since the landslip in 2011 (pictured) the land has moved closer to the mobile homes, sparking fears they could fall off

Coastal erosion is caused by the waves crashing against the rocks over a long period of time.

Sediment is eventually worn away, but sometimes the process is made quicker by wind or extreme weather.

The Blue Anchor Bay in Minehead, west Somerset, which was built in the 15th century, is facing a similarly uncertain future because the cliff face has fallen away. 

It has already been forced to close its children's play area because it is dangerously close to the crumbling cliff face,

At Birling Gap in East Sussex, a stretch of chalk cliff has seen erosion, which would normally take over seven years, happen in just a few months.

Part of the footpath down to one of the best beaches in the world at Rhossili on Gower in south Wales has also been washed away.

Strong winds have left some of the 270 beach huts at Studland on the Dorset coast vulnerable to being lost to the sea.
