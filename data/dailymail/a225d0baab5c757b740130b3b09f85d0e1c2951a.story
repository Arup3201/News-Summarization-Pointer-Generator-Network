As tight-fisted car dealer Boycie in Only Fools and Horses he was famous for going to great lengths to avoid getting a round in down the Nags Head.

But actor John Challis could be forgiven for feeling more than a little short-changed after teenagers from a care home overlooking his mansion broke in and stole his prized malt whisky.

Mr Challis, 69, says his local community of Adforton in Herefordshire has been plagued for years by unruly residents from the home and he has now succeeded getting the company that runs it to plant a 12ft hedge to stop any prying eyes.

Hedging his bets: John Challis at his home Wigmore Abbey in Herefordshire. He has forced a nearby children's home to build a 12ft hedge after two 
youngsters pinched a bottle of whisky from his home

The Mill House Care Home houses just 
three troubled teenagers, but police say the residents’ have clocked up 
19 crimes locally in the first six months of the year.

Mr Challis was on holiday in Hawaii 
with wife Carol, 63, when the lads raided his £750,000 Grade I listed 
property in February this year.

West Mercia Police revealed the home had cost them over £200,000 in the last seven years.

Between January and June this year, 
19 of the 26 crimes in Adforton concerned the care home - including nine
calls about missing children which cost the force £22,500.

Yesterday Keys Childcare, which runs 
the home, agreed to erect a large hedge around the property in order to 
stop youngsters looking into the Challis’ home.

In fiction as in life: Boycie starred in a spin-off series in which he moved to the country with his wife, Marlene, after being forced to flee from Peckham

Mr Challis, whose Wigmore Abbey 
mansion is just 60 yards away from the home, told a public meeting last 
month it was in the 'wrong place' and called for it to be moved.

He said: ''To be told by the company,
after this latest incident when two of the boys got out and broke into 
the house on two separate occasions, that the home did not feel their 
staff had been negligent, I find unbelievable.

'They had broken in and stolen some malt whisky.

Only
Fools and Horses, written by John Sullivan, was one of Britain's 
best-loved TV shows and it brought catchphrases such as 'lovely jubbly',
'cushty', 'plonker' and 'this time next year we'll be millionaires' into
living rooms across the country.

It was first broadcast in 1981 and aired in seven series until 1991, with sporadic Christmas specials in later years.

One
festive episode in 1996 - in which Del Boy and Rodney became wealthy 
following the discovery and sale of a valuable watch - attracted 
24.3million viewers, the highest UK audience for a sitcom.

'The strength of feeling is very strong. We have been going through this for 10 years.

'The community have had enough, this was the last straw.

'I
understand the need to look after unfortunate young people. It is a 
very difficult job but this is totally in the wrong place.'

Carol Walker, spokeswoman for Keys 
Childcare, said: 'An agreement was made to plant a hedge around the 
boundary of the fence subject to agreement with the landlord.

'It
has been agreed as an interim arrangement that Keys can continue to 
operate the home until the lease expires in 18 months time when the 
arrangements will be further reviewed.'

Managers
at the home also promised to meet Adforton Parish Council every two 
months to iron out any problems or concerns arising from Mill House Care
Home.

A
friend of the actor said: 'The children’s home have agreed to erect a 
hedge which is part grown so at least the young people inside won’t be 
able to ogle John and Carol but how long does a hedge take to grow to 
full height?

'It is understood the suggestion is to let the hedge grow to 12ft in height but it’s not most satisfactory outcome.'
