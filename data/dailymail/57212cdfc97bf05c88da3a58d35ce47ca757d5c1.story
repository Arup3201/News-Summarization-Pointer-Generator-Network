Ryan Taylor described it as a 'dream come true' as he basked in the glory of both Newcastle's 2-0 win over Manchester City and his return from a two-year injury nightmare.

The Magpies caught City cold at the Etihad, with strikes from Rolando Aarons and Moussa Sissoko booking a Capital One Cup quarter-final at Tottenham.

But the feel-good story of the evening was the long-awaited return to action of right back Taylor, who has been sidelined with successive cruciate ligament problems since 2012.

'That was a fairytale, a dream, everything, it all came true tonight,' he told Sky Sports 1. 'Two years of hard graft for myself just to get back playing football is a big thing for me, but what a performance that was from the lads.'

Aarons gave Newcastle the lead with a fine finish from an acute angle, firing in between the legs of City goalkeeper Willy Caballero, before Sissoko stroked home 15 minutes from time to secure Newcastle's second win in four days.

Keeper Rob Elliott, in for the rested Tim Krul on Wednesday night, spoke about the renewed confidence of his side and also paid tribute to Taylor.

'I think it was always there (confidence) it was just about getting results and now you're seeing a difference in the team, but tonight's all about Ryan,' he said.

'He's epitomised everything about us today, two years of solid hard work, with set backs, and it just shows what we are like and I think everyone is buzzing for him and the fans - it's a great night for us all.'
