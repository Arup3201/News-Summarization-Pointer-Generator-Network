Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has confirmed he will not appeal his touchline ban and thanked supporters in the wake of his fan row.

The Foxes chief will serve a one-match touchline ban for their home clash with Tottenham on Boxing Day after being found guilty of misconduct.

Pearson requested a personal hearing, which he had on Friday, after a heated exchange with a fan during Leicester's 3-1 defeat by Liverpool earlier this month.

But Pearson, who was also fined £10,000, will not fight the charge and it will not change his plans for Spurs.

'No I'm not, I can't see any reason to,' he said, when asked if he was appealing.

'I decided to go along to the personal hearing, which intrigued me to see how it went, so we'll get on with it now.

'I was going upstairs again anyway (on Friday) so it fits in quite well. It is what it is, I can't do anything about it now.

The Leicester boss continues his tirade against the supporter from the touchline

'I have been overwhelmed by the level of support from within the game.

'From managers, players, ex-colleagues and members of the media, it has been overwhelming.

'I would like to thank everyone who has given me that moral support.

'It is time to put the subject to bed, the ruling has been made on me and as always I will take it for what it is and move on.'
