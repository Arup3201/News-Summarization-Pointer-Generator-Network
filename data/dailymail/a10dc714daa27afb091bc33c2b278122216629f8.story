Climbers and trekkers travelling to the Himalayas could soon be required to take GPS tracking units with them, following the country’s worst ever trekking disaster.

Nepalese officials are planning to introduce new rules, improve weather forecasts and better monitor the movement of tourists and local guides after at least 41 people were killed last week when a deadly blizzard and avalanches swept through the mountains.

Tourism Department official Tulasi Gautam said tourists visiting the country’s popular mountain trails will be required to take trained local guides, and will have to rent a satellite navigation unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency.

He said the government plans to announce the new rules before the next trekking season in the spring.

Officials say 41 people, including foreign tourists and local guides, were killed last week and more than 500 stranded trekkers were rescued after becoming trapped in a snowstorm in the Mustang, Manang and Dolpa districts north of Kathmandu.

The area is hugely popular with tourists and on Sunday Nepalese officials were forced to close a section of the popular Annapurna trekking circuit because new groups of hikers had continued to pour into the area where most of the victims died.

The snowstorms were caused by cyclone that hit the Indian coast a few days earlier. Hikers were stranded when the weather conditions deteriorated rapidly.

Most of the victims were on or near the Annapurna trekking route, a 140-mile collection of trails through the mountain range.

Many were caught on the Thorong La pass, one of the highest points on the circuit.

However, experts have dismissed the idea of introducing the GPS systems as a ‘knee-jerk reaction’.

Simon Lowe, managing director for the UK-based Jagged Globe mountaineering company said they would not prevent more disasters from occurring in Nepal.

‘Technology alone is not a solution to the problem,’ he said. ‘GPS systems often don’t work in harsh conditions anyway.

‘In this situation getting lost was not the problem, it was the fact that the climbers and their guides went out in a raging storm.

‘There needs to be better training and education in place for both the trekkers, local guides and porters on the mountains so that decision making is improved.

‘High-tech gadgets aren’t required to get weather forecasts. Long-wave radio is available throughout the mountains and which is capable of providing accurate weather forecasts.

‘Trekkers with little experience need to make sure they are hiring guides with sufficient training, knowledge and ability to draw upon in the event of an emergency.

Tour operators can charge up to £1,800 for a three-week trek around the Annapurna circuit

Nepal's Tourism Department said tourists visiting the Himalyas will be required to take trained local guides, and will have to rent a satellite navigation unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency

‘There needs to be a full public enquiry as to what went wrong, and no knee-jerk reactions’.

Up to 12 Britons are still unaccounted for following the tragedy.

Half of the dead were Nepali porters, guides and cooks, many of whom did not have any warm weatherproof coats or boots to protect them, something which has angered rescue leaders who claim Nepalese tour guides died because they were poorly equipped.

They also suggest that foreign tourists were favoured in the rescue mission.

Captain Adhikari, the Nepalese Army rescue leader who led more than 70 hikers to safety following the storm, said local victims had been wearing causal clothes, including flip flops and trainers.

He told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The worst thing was seeing the equipment and gear of the Nepali porters and guides because it meant they were dead, but they were not well-equipped.

‘The Nepalis I saw were wearing normal dress, some of them in slippers, some had coats and some didn’t. They did not have proper clothes or protection from the snow...this could be a factor in why so many Nepalis died.’

Tour operators charge up to £1,800 for a three-week trek around the Annapurna circuit, but Captain Adhikari suggested that some porters earn as little as £9 a day.

His comments were supported by Baburam Bhandari, the Nepal government’s chief district officer in charge of the rescue effort in Mustang, where most of the victims were found dead.

‘There was no preparation,’ he said. ‘Many trekkers that came into the storm arrived without planning.

‘Their porters had no trekking shoes or coats. They were in sports shoes and normal clothes because they’re poor - it is one of the causes of their deaths. 

'Some of them died because they were too cold - it was freezing snow, five or six feet deep.’

Keshav Pande of the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal said his group offers low cost clothing and equipment rental for porters and guides but many of them believe they do not need them.

Foreign trekkers often hire their own guides directly, rather than through established trekking companies, and are focused on keeping their costs down.

‘If the group is organised they have all the equipment but the tourists want cheaper, they get someone from the street to guide them. They want cheap, cheap, cheap’ he said.
