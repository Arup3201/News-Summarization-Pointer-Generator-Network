A drunken Welsh wedding guest who insulted the English was convicted of racism today.

Phillip Pritchard, 32, was on a coach home from a smart country wedding in Wales when he started singing anti-English songs.

A court heard Pritchard, a father of two, was 'winding up' some of the wedding guests who travelled from England for the ceremony at the upmarket Peterstone Court Hotel in Brecon.

He began by singing rugby songs but then segued into anti-English chants of his own design.

Another Welshman on the coach 
objected to Pritchard’s taunts and a 'heated row' erupted, forcing the 
coach driver to pull over into a lay-by and call police.

Prosecutor Helen Tench said: 'The passengers had been to a wedding reception when Pritchard began singing rugby songs.

'He then started singing: “I’d rather cut my f****** arm off than be English”.

'Passenger Gwyn Richards felt it was abusive as there were people he knew to be English on the coach.'

Bread of heaven: The Welsh flag with red dragon rampant

The wedding guests were on their way 
home from the luxury Peterstone Court Hotel in Brecon, South Wales, when
 Pritchard started his anti-English abuse.

Pritchard, of Swansea, admitted using racially aggravated threatening, insulting, abusive words or behaviour.

Lucinda Nicholls, defending, said: 'He was one of many guests at a wedding function and it appears they were all intoxicated to some extent.

'There was some banter between some English people and Mr Pritchard, who is Welsh.

'Rugby songs were chanted and he got carried away.

'Just to add to the unusualness of the situation, the complainant in the matter is Welsh, not English, but felt other people on the bus would take offence.'

Pritchard was given a 12-month conditional discharge with costs of £150 by Brecon magistrates.
