Big Bunch of Complaints: Inquiry launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal

More than 850 BBC employees have come forward to raise concerns about bullying and sexual harassment at the corporation, it has emerged.

The staff members have contacted private consultants brought in by the BBC as part of an internal inquiry set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The Rose Review, overseen by human rights lawyer Dinah Rose QC, was launched last October following a wave of damaging claims from female presenters including Liz Kershaw and Sandi Toksvig who said they were routinely groped while working for the BBC.

Staff were asked to detail their experiences under a guarantee of anonymity, while one-to-one sessions have also taken place between BBC staff members and an outside company, Change Associates.

It is believed that one senior BBC executive is the subject of more than 20 complaints of bullying.

Rose is now expected to report back at the end of this month and make recommendations on how the BBC can improve.

In an email to staff, the BBC’s director of human resources Lucy Adams told colleagues that some of the testimony is ‘uncomfortable to hear’.

She wrote: ‘Over 850 of you got in touch one way or another and gave your thoughts on respect, behaviour and culture at the BBC today, including issues such as harassment (including sexual harassment) and bullying.’

Among the hundreds who came forward to the enquiry, up to 20 former employees initially thought they would not be give evidence because they been paid off and made to sign contracts to stop them turning whistleblower.

Gagging clauses are typically part of ‘compromise agreements’ signed when an employee agrees to drop an employment tribunal claim in return for a pay-off.

However, it is understood that, following negotiations, their evidence was eventually allowed to go forward.

The BBC insists no-one has been barred from giving evidence, despite any previous agreements which may have been signed.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have recognised the need to take a serious and thorough look at the issues of sexual harassment and bullying.

'We will be publishing our Respect at Work report prepared with the assistance of Dinah Rose, QC, and also our review of the BBC child protection and whistle-blowing policies in the spring.’
