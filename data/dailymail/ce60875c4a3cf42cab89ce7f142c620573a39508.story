Stuart Broad has backed Ben Stokes to ‘get in the Indians’ faces’ ahead of next week’s first Investec Test at Trent Bridge — and called for livelier pitches following the shock loss to Sri Lanka.

Stokes’s inclusion in England’s 13-man squad for Nottingham lends the attack extra spark, and Broad said he liked what he saw in Australia when the Durham all-rounder gave as good as he got.

‘He was 22 and standing up to Brad Haddin in the toughest series he could have possibly played in,’ said Broad. ‘He came out as a shining light. He is the sort of player who can really get in the Indians’ faces.

‘We know the quality he has. He’s a raw talent, a player you want to play with and not against. He has already got a Test hundred and a six-for. He is obviously very talented.’

If Stokes plays next week, it will be his first appearance for England since fracturing a wrist punching a locker in the Caribbean in March.

Asked what advice he would give Stokes if his frustrations boil over at Trent Bridge, Broad replied: ‘I think they are made from solid wood, so it would be to avoid them!’

Broad was critical of the slowness of the pitches laid out at Lord’s and Headingley for the Sri Lankans, who are used to those conditions at home. ‘There is no excuse for wickets not to have nicks that carry,’ he said.

‘The amount of nicks that Matt Prior was trying to climb forward for —  I don’t think that is great for the game. I think wickets should be flat, but a fair contest between bat and ball and bowlers should rely on reverse swing and, if it’s cloudy, swing.’

India completed their match preparations on Thursday with a contrived win against Derbyshire, reaching their target of 142 in 45 overs with five wickets and more than eight overs to spare.

But there was bad news for Test hopeful Rohit Sharma. After failing to get a bat in the first innings at Derby, he made just 10 before edging left-arm spinner David Wainwright to Wes Durston at slip.

All-rounder Stuart Binny could yet come into the equation, especially with Trent Bridge traditionally helping swing bowlers.

Chance: England will hope Stokes comes back itching to do good after his decent Ashes winter performance

Return: Stokes' name is the only addition to the 12 selected for two Tests against Sri Lanka
