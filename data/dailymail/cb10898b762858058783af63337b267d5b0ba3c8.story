An EMT from New Jersey became an Internet sensation, but also landed in hot work with his employer, after a video of him dancing behind the wheel of an ambulance went viral.

The now-notorious clip showing paramedic Jonathan Williams ‘voguing’ to a remix of Rihanna's hit Pour It Up was recorded last week and uploaded on YouTube the same day.

The hilarious two-minute video showing the overly enthusiastic EMT flailing his arms every which way, wildly wiggling in the driver's seat and belting out with a grin on his face has been viewed more than 800,000 times as of Saturday afternoon, and counting.

His jam: New Jersey EMT Jonathan Williams was overjoyed when Rihanna's Pour It Up, came on the radio while he was driving home from work in his ambulance last week

Internet star: The video of Williams dancing behind the wheel went viral, drawing more than 800,000 views on YouTube

He's got the moves: In the video, the first responder flails his arms, sways to the beat and takes both his hands off the wheel

Slap on the wrist: Williams got a reprimand at work for his less-than-safe dance routine

Born to dance: Speaking in his defense, the amateur lord of the dance said he was off duty, and he would not have done it with a patient on board

The viral video even caught the attention of Rihanna, who tweeted to her followers Wednesday: 'This Paramedic guy just reminded me why God sent me here! I can't stop now! Not now, not nevah!!!!'

But the growing popularity of the dancing EMT also earned him a reprimand from his supervisor.

Just before 6pm on May 6, Williams was driving an emergency response vehicle while talking to a colleague on a walkie-talkie when a mashup of Rhianna’s Pour It Up and Juicy J’s Bandz a Make Her Dance came on the radio. 

Williams grew animated, pumping his firsts, swaying to the beat, and even taking his hands completely off the wheel several times.

His friend Bianca Lotin told the station CBS News York that the paramedic is just as ebullient and over-the-top in his everyday life as he appears in the video.

Name drop: The viral video caught Rihanna's attention, prompting her to tweet about the dancing paramedic

The real deal: Williams' impromptu dance routine was inspired by Rihanna's hit Pour It Up (music video pictured)

Speaking to CBS this week, Williams said that he was off duty and on his way home when he decided to bust a move behind the wheel.

'I'd never do that with a patient on board,' Williams reassured.

Asked about his reaction to Rihanna's Twitter shoutout, the paramedic said he was 'utterly flabbergasted.'
