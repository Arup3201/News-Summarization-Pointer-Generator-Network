Criminal charges were filed on Wednesday against a 32-year-old man accused of molesting a 19-year-old woman while she was asleep on an international Delta Air Lines flight from Detroit to Amsterdam.

Janarol Dickens is accused of putting his hand down her underwear while placing her hand on his crotch while she slept on the flight on June 10, 2012.

Dickens is only facing charges now, more than three years later, because he spent years outside of the United States, returning a little more than one-year ago.

Alleged assault: The 19-year-old Norwegian woman alleges that  Janarol Dickens, 32, molested her on an international flight from Detroit to Amsterdam

According to the FBI, American the US District Court in Detroit can hear the charges because the aircraft the assault allegedly occurred on departed from the United States.

According to an FBI affidavit, the 19-year-old Norwegian woman boarded the flight and began conversation with Dickens, who is an American citizen, but not from Michigan.

Dickens allegedly asked the woman whether she wanted to watch a movie with him and she declined and fell asleep.

When she awoke, Dickens allegedly had his hand down her pants, underneath her underwear and was 'rubbing' her private parts according to the Detroit Free Press.

Interviewed: Dickens was questioned by Royal Dutch Police in Amsterdam but no arrest or charges were pressed

At the same time, he had placed the woman's hand on his erect penis, according to the FBI affidavit.

She left her seat and went to the flight staff in tears and was so upset she was trembling.

Upon arrival at Amsterdam airport, Dickens was interviewed by the Dutch Royal Military Police and denied any wrong doing.

No further action was taken by the Dutch police.

It was not until Dickens re-entered the United States two years later in Miami that the incident was flagged.

He was interviewed by the FBI and admitted to being detained by the Dutch police for the matter and initially denied the accusations.

However, the affidavit claims that he eventually admitted to putting his hand inside the woman's pants for 10 seconds, but not down her underwear.

He also said the woman had not agreed to this.

According to the FBI this amounts to crime because there was no permission granted for a sexual act.
