The sisters of child killer Mairead Philpott claim she is a 'victim' of her controlling husband Mick - but they cannot forgive her for the deaths of their nieces and nephews.

Jennifer Lobban and Bernadette Duffy told of their desperate attempts to convince her to leave Mick since they married in May 2003, and take the children away.

They claim Mairead was so unhappy she had even attempted suicide in the months before the tragic fire.

documentary how they tried on several occasions to rescue her from 
Philpott's clutches without success

But the family told Panorama ultimately she put the man she described in court as her 'guardian angel' above everything else.

During the couple's eight-week trial, Mairead painted herself as a vulnerable character from a troubled background.  

Born in Ireland, she came from a traveller family and made allegations of abuse as a child, having been forced from school by bullies and raped in her teenage years.

Vulnerable: Mairead Philpott was 19 and at 'rock bottom' when she met Mick

She was, she admitted, at ‘rock bottom’ when she met Philpott aged just 19, and jumped at the chance to move in with him.

Mairead gave birth to their first child Jade in August 2001, followed by John in October 2002. They would go on to have three more children together.

But while they were by then engaged, there was nothing conventional about their living arrangements because Philpott had introduced a second woman, Lisa Willis, into the household. 

Within weeks, their relationship had become sexual, the two women agreeing to take it in turns to share Philpott’s bed.

Despite this Mairead agreed to marry Mick in May 2003. Miss Willis even acted as bridesmaid at their wedding.

In court she admitted she was 'hurt' by his relationship with Miss Willis but agreed to it because she didn't want to lose her family.

Sources said the women were expected to have sex with Philpott virtually every day, and were ‘on their backs’ even when pregnant.

So why did Mairead put up with this? Her family say she was terrified of him, and that he isolated her and the children from those who cared about them.

Jennifer and Bernadette told how the fragile peace which held the household together imploded after Lisa Willis finally had enough and left.

Jennifer Lobban told Panorama: 'We would try and get round there when he was doing the school run because we knew that he wouldn’t be in the house.

'We told her that we could go to the school, we could go now; go take the kids from school. We would get her out, but she just wouldn’t leave.'

Did the benefits system contribute to the Philpott fire killings?

Mick Philpott once allowed the eldest child, Duwayne, 13, to have a sleepover at Bernadette’s house.

Bernadette said the little boy was in a terrible state, adding: 'Mick said he hadn’t eaten for a week and I took him and my little boy out for a pizza.

'I had never seen a child eat so fast in my life.’

Mairead's father Jimmy Duffy told Panorama he has had difficulty accepting his daughter was responsible for the children's deaths.

He said: 
'It’s wrecking me inside, wrecking me... I bottle a lot up away from my
kids... Some nights I sit for hours in the dark.'

The family have also dismissed Mairead’s claims in 
court that her father abused her as a child.

Police have confirmed the 
allegations were investigated at the time and found no evidence of any 
crime by Jimmy Duffy. They also said there are no plans to follow up 
Mairead’s courtroom claim.

Bernadette and Jennifer say it is 
not the first time their sister has made a false sex allegation. In 
court, Mairead told the jury she'd been raped on holiday as a teenager.

Her sister Jennifer says she was with her at the time of the alleged 
incident: 'I think it’s just one of the many lies she tells. She got 
caught sleeping with a married man for money and she said she was raped.
Not only has she played a part in her children’s deaths. It just seems 
that she will do anything to get out of it.'

Although Mairead’s sisters say they both 
believe she is a victim of Mick Philpott, they cannot understand why she put him before the lives of all her children.

Jennifer said: 'Yeah. She is a victim of Mick. But at the end of the day, when it 
comes to your kids, she should have put them first. She should have put 
the kids first.'

Disbelief: Jimmy Duffy says he still finds it hard to comprehend that his daughter was responsible for the deaths of six children

Sentencing Mairead to 17 years in jail today, Mrs Justice Thirwall made it clear she did not regard Mairead Philpott as a 'victim'.

She said: 'I have already made clear that this was Michael Philpott's plan. I accept that he treated you as a skivvy or a slave, and you were prepared to put up with that.

'As became clear during the trial you were prepared to go to any lengths, however humiliating, to keep him happy.

'But as the evidence came out it was plain that this was not quite the position.

'This was put beyond doubt when you gave evidence. You pointed out that you had stood up to him in the past. That is why when he asked you for a divorce on no fewer than three occasions you refused him.

'It is inescapable therefore that when something was important enough to you, you were capable of exercising a choice which was not his choice.

'Instead you joined in with his plan.

'The risks were obvious and overwhelming and anyone who has heard the harrowing wailing from you on the 999 call can hear your realisation that this had gone horribly wrong and your children were in mortal danger.

'You put Michael Philpott above your children and as a result they have died. After the fire you threw your lot in with Michael Philpott. You supported him in his quest to get residence of the other children. You complied with his sexual demands to keep Paul Mosley onside.

'You lied to the police and you stuck to the story, just as he asked you to, to the police and to the jury.

'You now have convictions for six counts of the manslaughter of your children.'
