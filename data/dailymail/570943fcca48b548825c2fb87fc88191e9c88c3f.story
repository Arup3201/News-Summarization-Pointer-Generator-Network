This is the astonishing moment a Brooklyn Nets fan was carried out by security guards – amid claims that he attacked another supporter with his prosthetic leg.

The man removed his prosthetic limb before hitting another fan  in the upper deck of the arena, according to a pair security guards at Madison Square Garden, New York.

Video shows how he was hauled from his seat and physically removed by two members of staff amid fears the situation could escalate.

The drama unfolded with around five minutes to play in the third quarter of Brooklyn’s 98-93 win over the New York Knicks.

The New York Daily News quotes a staffer as saying: ‘They grabbed him and pulled him out. I don’t know if he was arrested but they got him out of there so he didn’t start a riot.’

Afterwards, the man was named on social media as Nets ‘super fan’ Jeffrey Gamblero, according to the Daily News website.

The report says some eyewitnesses dispute the version of events given by Garden security and that he did not attack anyone.

One unidentified fan is quoted as saying: ‘I saw what happened. He didn’t deserve to be thrown out. He was just into the game.’

Video posted online by @jeigs, New York comedian Jesse Eigner, showed how the fan, who was dressed in Brooklyn Nets clothing, was carried away from his seat without his prosthetic leg while stunned supporters watched on.

A Knicks spokesman said: ‘An unruly fan was ejected after MSG security received multiple complaints from fans sitting in that area.

‘The fan was warned multiple times before being removed. He will not be permitted back into Madison Square Garden.’ 

MailOnline has attempted to contact Mr Gamblero for comment this morning.
