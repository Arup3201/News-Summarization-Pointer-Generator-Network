A fed-up woman in a Croatian village has won a court order banning her neighbour's dog from barking during the night saying its constant noise was affecting her health.

Three-year-old Medo is now not allowed to make any noise between 8pm and 8am and is the only dog in the country to have a no-barking injunction.

His owner Anton Simunovic has also been told he must keep the dog quiet and has been threatened with a 2,800 euro (£2,083) fine if his pet breaches the order.

Dog Medo barks in his backyard in a northern Croatian village. The pet has been banned from making any noise at night by a court in the country 

In charges filed by Simunovic's neighbour, she says that the constant barking at night is ruining her health.

But Mr Simunovic refutes the claim saying Medo behaves like any other dog.

He said: 'He barks normally, like any dog does.

Medo's owner Anton Simunovic attempts to keep his pet quiet. Mr Simunovic has also been threatened with a fine Medo doesn't stop barking at night 

'He barks when he sees a cat, or if someone unknown comes to his territory.'

The order now means that Medi must spend the nights confined in a barn rather than being allowed to roam free.

A court in the town of Pula still has to make a final ruling on the case, with the neighbour also seeking 1,400 euros (£1,041) in damages.

More than 30,000 people have joined a Facebook page to support Medo and posted pictures of their pets in a show of solidarity  

Medo's troubles have also sparked widespread social media interest in Croatia with more than 30,000 people joining Facebook page to support him.

The page was set up since the case emerged last month.

Dog owners have sent hundreds of pictures of their pets to the page offering their solidarity to Medo and Mr Simunovic, and even some cats have also joined the campaign.
