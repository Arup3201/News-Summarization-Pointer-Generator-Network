They're America's newest teen celebrities since becoming golden girls at the London Olympics, and even Princess Kate wanted to wish them well.

The Duchess of Cambridge chatted with four of the five members of the U.S. women’s gymnastics squad for a few moments yesterday after the vault competition.

Aly Raisman, Jordyn Wieber, Kyla Ross and Gabby Douglas were in awe as the princess approached them at the O2 Arena.

The gymnasts took to Twitter to express their excitement at meeting the British royal and style icon.

Raisman, the team captain, tweeted: 'Just met princess Kate with @jordyn_wieber @kyla_ross96 & @gabrielledoug she is beautiful & so nice! I told her I loved her style lol :)'.

A minute later, Wieber added: 'Can’t believe I just met Princess Kate Middleton! She was in the crowd at the competition and she stood up to talk to us! #honored'.

The member of the Fab Five missing out on the meet and greet with the duchess was McKayla Maroney, who had been competing in the vault competition.

Though she was the favourite in the event, Maroney suffered a fall during her routine, which cost her the gold medal.

But Team GB has had much success when the Duchess of Cambridge is in the audience.

Princess Kate, an ambassador for Team GB, has kept a busy Olympic schedule and has proven to be a lucky charm for British athletes.

She joined Princes William and Harry and other senior members of the Royal family as they watched Zara Phillips take home silver during the equestrian eventing.

On Thursday, she and William couldn't 
contain their delight and showed a rare public display of affection as 
they hugged when the men's sprinting team, led by cyclist Sir Chris Hoy,
won gold in record-breaking time.

Kate was also at Wimbledon earlier in
the day and watched Andy Murray reach the semi-finals. He later went on
to defeat Switzerland's Roger Federer to claim gold.
