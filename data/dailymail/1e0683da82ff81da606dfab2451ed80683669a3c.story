To his many friends and  relatives, Graham Mellor was always larger than life.

At 7ft 2in, though, the gentle giant sometimes admitted that being so tall was a burden.

Sadly, in death, his towering frame has left his loved ones facing extra heartache – over his funeral arrangements.

'Gentle giant': The family of the late 7ft 2in Graham Mellor face a 70-mile round trip to cremate him because his local crematoriums can't cater for his giant coffin

The two crematoriums nearest his home 
in Bucknall, Stoke-on-Trent, turned them away saying Mr Mellor’s 7ft 9in
coffin is too big for them to cremate.

It means the shocked relatives have 
had to organise two services for Mr Mellor – a funeral locally next 
Thursday followed by a 70-mile round trip for his cremation 
the following day.

His cousin Sharon Edwards, 47, said 
yesterday: ‘I have never heard anything like this before. I am 
completely taken aback and it hasn’t quite sunk in yet.

‘It will have to be a two-day funeral which makes things quite awkward. But it is nobody’s fault.

‘He is an exceptional case because of his height and the funeral directors have been great in trying to organise the ceremony.’

Former steel worker Mr Mellor, 72, who
also worked occasionally as a barman, reached his full height when he 
was only 15 and in 1967 was crowned Staffordshire’s Tallest Man. With a 
54in waist, a 39in inside leg and weighing about 25st, he had to have 
his clothes and size 15 shoes specially made.

He never married and, until they died in the 1980s, he lived with his parents Arthur, who was 6ft 7in, and Gwendoline, 6ft 2in.

He died at his home on February 13 
after suffering a ruptured aneurysm. His relatives were stunned when 
crematoriums at Carmountside in Stoke-on-Trent and Bradwell in 
Newcastle-under-Lyme said they could not take the coffin.

So although a funeral service will be 
held at Carmountside, friends and family face a 35-mile journey to 
Bretby, Burton on Trent, the following day as the crematorium there is 
the nearest that can cater for such a large coffin. It means costs have 
spiralled.

‘I’m not sure how much it will be in 
total because it’s in the hands of the solicitors but I know we’re going
to wince when we see the bill,’  Mrs Edwards said.

‘We’ve got two separate services 
because a lot of his old pals won’t be able to get all the way to 
Bretby. We are expecting about 100 people to turn up. His height was 
always a bit of a burden to him. Everybody called him the Tall Man of 
Bucknall or Big Man. You couldn’t take your eyes off him. It was a bit 
frightening but he had a heart of gold.

‘He will be best remembered for his 
time spent in The Travellers’ ex-servicemen’s club playing cards and 
darts.’

Stoke-on-Trent City Council said the cremation equipment at 
Carmountside is the ‘industry standard’ size but cremation of a coffin 
over 7ft long had to be done at a specialist facility.

Turned away: The crematorium at Bradwell (pictured), close to Graham's home in Stoke-on-Trent, can only take coffins 7ft in length, whereas his is 7ft 9in
