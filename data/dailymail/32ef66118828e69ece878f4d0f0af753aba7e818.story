Roberto Martinez admitted that Kevin Mirallas' injury was the only negative from Everton's 3-1 defeat of QPR on Monday evening.

Goals from Ross Barkley, Mirallas and Steven Naismith gave the Toffees a commanding victory at Goodison Park, but a poor challenge from Jordan Mutch towards the end of the game saw the Belgium international carried off on a stretcher.

Martinez expressed his disappointment at the challenge and confirmed Mirallas is set for a scan to determine the damage to his ankle.

'Kevin is a real negative today, he's got a real bad ankle,' he said. 'We're going to scan it in the morning and see the extent of the injury.

'It was a real disappointment to see him carried off at the end.'

On a more positive note, the manager was delighted with his team's cutting edge in front of goal, which saw his side move above Liverpool into tenth place.

'I was really really pleased in the manner that we carried that sort of threat,' he said.

'We always had a good balance, we defended well when we had to, we had real good pace on the counter-attack and overall we were clinical in front of goal.'

The Everton manager was also unsurprisingly  full of praise for Barkley, who took the man of the match honours after opening the scoring with a wonder strike from distance.

'The big enjoyment working with Ross is how quickly he takes concepts on and how quickly he experiments with different starting positions.

'The power and pace that he has combined with that technical ability and ball control makes him special.

'Sometimes you get a really talented footballer who is skillful on the ball or the powerful and strong that can show that physicality on the pitch. He's got both.'
