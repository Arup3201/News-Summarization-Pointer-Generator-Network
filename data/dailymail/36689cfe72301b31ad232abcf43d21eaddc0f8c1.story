The former managing editor of The Sun and three of the newspaper’s most senior journalists have been bailed after they were arrested yesterday over corruption allegations.

Along with a 29-year-old detective, they were all questioned about  illegal payments to police officers.

Detectives simultaneously searched the headquarters of News International, the paper’s publisher, in East London.

Investigation: A detective leaves the home of Mike Sullivan, the Sun crime editor, with paperwork and other potential evidence yesterday

The arrests mark a shift in the focus of the corruption investigation, Operation Elveden, which had centred on The Sun’s now defunct sister paper, the News of the World.

The four Sun employees are former managing editor Graham Dudman, 48, now a training director at News International; executive editor Fergus Shanahan, 56, a former deputy editor of the paper under Rebekah Brooks; long-serving crime editor Mike Sullivan, 48; and head of news Chris Pharo, 42.

Their arrests came as a result of information given to police by their employers. A source said it was an attempt at ‘draining the swamp’ to restore journalistic integrity at Rupert Murdoch’s newspapers.

Age: 56

Role at The Sun: Deputy Editor from 2003-9 when Rebekah Brooks was editor.

Background: The paper's Executive Editor and leader writer, crafting the comment pieces that appear under The Sun's name every day. He was night editor and worked on the 'back bench' in production. Started out on the Reading Evening News.

Age: 48

Role at The Sun: Formerly a managing editor.

Background: Works in a training role for News International. He was formerly the head of news and head of features. He was appointed by former editor David Yelland and previously worked as a freelance in Florida, Miami, as well as for The Express. He was a reporter on the Stockport Express (1983-5) and the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette (1985-7).

Age: 42

Role at The Sun: Head of news. Began his career with the South West News agency before becoming the South West  district reporter for the Sun and is a long-time staff member.

Age: 48

Role at The Sun: Began his career at National News agency before graduating to The Sun in his 20s. Sullivan is currently the paper's Crime Editor and has been for a number of years.

Staff and management at The Sun 
received no warning that police were planning to search the offices but 
they have long been aware that the internal investigators have been 
trawling through thousands of emails looking for evidence of wrongdoing 
by employees.

News 
Corporation, the parent company of News International, said the  company
‘made a commitment last summer that unacceptable news-gathering 
practices by individuals in the past would not be repeated.

‘It
commissioned the management and standards committee to undertake a 
review of all News International titles, regardless of cost, and to 
proactively co-operate with law enforcement and other authorities if 
potentially relevant information arose at those titles.’

Four
of the arrests took place between 6am and 8am and were on suspicion of 
corruption, aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and 
conspiracy in relation to those two offences.

The
men were being questioned at police stations in London and Essex.

Police are understood to have mistakenly visited Mr Pharo’s former 
marital home before phoning him.

He later attended  voluntarily at a 
police station, where he was arrested.

Sir Paul Stephenson, the then Met Commissioner, said in July that evidence from News International suggested a small number of officers were involved

The heir to Rupert Murdoch’s media empire has quit the board of Britain’s biggest drugs company in the wake of the phone hacking scandal.

James Murdoch joined  GlaxoSmithKline less than two years ago.

He has come under fire from MPs who have questioned him about signing off out-of-court settlements to hacking victims without a full picture of what had gone on at the News of the World.

He was forced to deny misleading Parliament over the extent of his knowledge.

Glaxo said Mr Murdoch’s decision to turn his back on the £98,000 role was entirely his own.

Chairman Chris Gent said: ‘James has taken this decision to focus on his current duties as non-executive chairman of BSkyB and following his decision to re-locate to the United States as chairman and chief executive, international, of News Corporation.’

Mr Murdoch has recently removed himself from the boards of all the UK newspaper companies owned by News International, including the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun.

The
detective was arrested at the Central London police station where he 
works in the Metropolitan Police’s Territorial Policing Command.

He was 
detained on suspicion of corruption, misconduct in a public office and 
conspiracy in relation to those two offences. The arrests bring to 13 
the total number of arrests under Operation Elveden.

A
Scotland Yard spokesman said the operation was about suspected payments
to police officers and was not about ‘seeking journalists to reveal 
confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained 
legitimately’.

In an email 
to Sun staff yesterday, News International’s chief executive Tom 
Mockridge described the arrests as ‘very difficult news’.

He
said the company was ‘confronting past mistakes and is making 
fundamental changes about how we operate which are essential for our 
business’.

Others 
questioned as part of Operation Elveden include former News 
International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, ex-Downing Street 
communications chief Andy Coulson and former News of the World managing 
editor Stuart Kuttner.

Mrs 
Brooks and Mr Coulson are both former editors of the News of the World, 
which in a shock move was closed in July last year following revelations
that reporters had hacked the mobile phone of murdered teenager Milly 
Dowler.

Deborah Glass, 
deputy chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is 
supervising the investigation, said the arrests yesterday showed that 
police were ‘following the evidence’.

She
added: ‘I am satisfied with the strenuous efforts being made by this 
investigation to identify police officers who may have taken corrupt 
payments and I believe the results will speak for themselves.’

Deborah Glass, deputy chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), has said she is satisfied with the efforts being made to identify police officers who may have taken corrupt payments
