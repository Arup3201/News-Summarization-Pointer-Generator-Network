With their pure white feathers and long, elegant necks, swans normally look the picture of grace and tranquility.

But feathers flew when these birds began vying to build a nest for their mate's eggs.

Abbotsbury Swannery in Dorset is gearing up for the swan nesting season with 400 swans on site and another 200 expected to fly in during the next few months.

You shall not pass! These two male swans ripped into each other in Dorset, as nesting season got under way

Ouch! The birds become fiercely protective during nesting season, which lasts between March and May

And one bird was determined to mark his territory, chasing away any other swan that came within flapping distance.

However, the aggressive male then came up against a competitor, and a violent fight ensued, with the pair kicking, beating the other with their wings, snapping their beaks and even attempting to push the other below the water.

But eventually the initial bully was defeated, and peace returned to the Swannery.

Between March and May swans construct a huge nest, in which the female swan - known as a pen - typically lays a clutch of between 3 and 7 eggs.

Causing a splash: These male swans - known as Cobs - will fight to the death during the season, but in this case they stopped sparring when one admitted defeat

The Swannery in Dorset has more than 400 swans - and inevitably feathers will fly when the female swans lay their eggs

Take that! The swans were initially kept in Dorset by monks who would cook them for banquets - but now they are kept to breed (And occasionally squabble)

During the breeding season the male swan - known as a Cob - becomes very territorial and aggressive to any intruders.

This behaviour has been known to extend to swans fighting to the death.

They will often threaten humans who venture too close to their nests, and deliver a warning call before attacking by beating their wings.

The swans pictured show mute swans, which have long S-shaped neck, and an orange bill with black at the base of it.

Recently the UK population has increased recently, perhaps due to better protection of this species.

Giving chase: The Cobs will do anything to protect their eggs, and females usually lay between three and seven at a time

The two swans squared up to a match after one became too cocky in the Swannery and began attacking everyone

But eventually the bullying swan calmed down and accepted defeat after he got a taste of his own medicine

In wintry weather, some birds arrive from Europe into eastern England.

The Swannery was established by Benedictine Monks who built a monastery at Abbotsbury during the 1040's.

The monks farmed the swans to produce food for their lavish Dorset banquets.

But St Peter's monastery was destroyed in 1539 during the dissolution and today it has become a popular family attraction.

Located on the Dorset coast, the habitat is popular with film makers and has been used as a location for Harry Potter filming.
