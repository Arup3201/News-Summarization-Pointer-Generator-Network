A cold snap from the Arctic caused snow and freezing temperatures across much of the UK yesterday.

As most people enjoyed the extra hour in bed as the clocks went back, the mild temperatures of the week gave way to 'exceptional cold', according to the Met Office.

Some parts of the UK were as cold as Moscow and snow settled in Scotland and the north of England. The Cairngorms in the Highlands of Scotland was hit hardest, with -7.3C.

England's coldest place was Bridgefoot in Cumbria, where temperatures fell to -3.5C.

Parts of London, Essex, Berkshire and Hertfordshire also saw snowfall. Snow that far south in October is a 'one in one hundred years event', according to The Weather Outlook.

Planes were delayed by up to three 
hours at Stansted Airport and flurries were reported at London City 
Airport, while up to two inches of snow fell in Scotland, Newcastle and parts of Yorkshire.

Police warned motorists to be cautious as snow brought chaos on the roads today. A lorry jack-knifed during blizzard conditions on the A1 in County Durham, causing a six-mile tailback of traffic, while Lincolnshire and Norfolk were scoured by freezing 60mph winds.

The Government announced that councils have stockpiled more than one million tonnes of road salt for the winter.

Councils have invested in new fleets of GPS-tracked gritting trucks, mini-gritters and specialist vehicles for narrow and hilly streets.

Thousands of grit bins have been placed in estates and side streets, while some families have been given their own bags of salt and salt spreaders.

Councillor Peter Box, Chair of the 
LGA's Economy and Transport Board, said: 'Whatever this winter throws at
us, motorists and residents can count on council highways teams being 
well prepared to keep roads safe and traffic moving.

Joy: Youngsters in County Durham hit the slopes early. However, the half-term week is expected to be a wash-out

'They've
got brand new gritters which use salt more effectively, the latest 
technology in snow ploughs and special quad-bikes and 4x4s to grit 
narrow or hilly roads.

'Council
websites will be constantly updated with information on weather, 
gritting routes, road conditions, school closures and bin collections, 
and many councils also have gritter Twitter feeds and Facebook pages detailing the latest developments.'

The wintry conditions will give way to drizzle, cloud and even a spot of sunshine in some places. A Met Office spokesman said: 'The colder air is being eroded away.

There will be outbreaks of rain as we go into tonight and some parts of Scotland might see a patchy frost but it will be milder tonight.

'Tomorrow there will be a mixture of cold spells and showers but also some sunshine in parts of Sussex and Kent as the cold snap moves slowly to the continent.'

'It will be cloudy across most parts of the UK with outbreaks of rain and drizzle, this may become more persistent and heavierin western parts.

'However, clear spells will begin to develop during the early hours.'

Tomorrow will see some sunny intervals, but a lot of cloud too. There will be scattered showers throughout the day, these heaviest along thesouth coast and Wales with an odd rumble of thunder possible.

Tuesday and Wednesday will be largely cloudy across northern parts. On Tuesday there will be outbreaks of rain and drizzle gradually pushing south.

Forecast: Rain, sun and wind over the next three days
