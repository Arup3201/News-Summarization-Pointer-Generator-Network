For a man of vaunting and, at times, unscrupulous ambition, Francois Hollande must have been grateful indeed for the backdrop of yesterday’s Nato summit in Wales.

Here, at least, alongside David Cameron, Barack Obama and other leaders, as they gravely discussed the international crises gripping the West, his stature was undiminished.

Back in his native France the devastating impact of the excoriating memoir penned in full revenge mode by his scorned first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, has stripped this diminutive, posturing president of his credibility — and his dignity.

Vengeance: Valerie Trierweiler sent shockwaves through France with her revelations about President Hollande

In public, political friends and even foes have reacted with traditional French disdain, making predictably lofty attempts to rubbish the book as a squalid act of spite. In private, they are lapping it up, with the autobiography already at the top of the bestseller lists and rapidly selling out of its first 200,000-copy print run.

Page after crushing page strips Hollande of his amour-propre. His former lover depicts him as a cynical liar who hates the working class, who mocks the disabled, and who pays only lip service to his socialist leanings.

Devastatingly, the president emerges as one of the ‘gauche caviars’ or caviar leftists — France’s version of our own champagne socialists. One commentator wrote yesterday of the ‘atmosphere of decadence’ revealed at Hollande’s Elysee Palace home.

For while Mme Trierweiler laces her bitter tome with stiletto-sharp insights into the president’s inadequacy as a man and as a politician, the most damaging of the extracts are those that depict him as a cold and heartless snob, a man who refers to the voters who put him into power two years ago as ‘les sans dents’ — the toothless.

Not that 49-year-old Trierweiler shies from mixing the personal with the political in her book, wryly titled Thank You For This Moment.

She feigns dismay at her ‘rottweiler’ nickname, given to her by former colleagues on the magazine Paris Match. ‘The expression spread. Gossiping is an unfortunate disease,’ she says — but she does not refrain from it.

Cold and heartless: The most damaging of the extracts are those that depict him as a cold and heartless snob, a man who refers to the voters who put him into power two years ago as ‘les sans dents’ — the toothless

 There is a lurid account of how her discovery of Hollande’s affair with the actress Julie Gayet put her in hospital following an attempted overdose of sleeping pills — and vicious mockery of photographs which showed him on the back of a moped, visiting his younger lover.

‘The first lady in hospital wasn’t a good image for the President,’ she writes. ‘Besides, nothing was very good for his image in this episode. And above all not the photo which was taken in the Rue du Cirque with a crash helmet on his head.’

She also ridicules Hollande’s strange propensity for allowing himself to be photographed in the rain, looking like a drowned rat. 

‘He refused an umbrella,’ she says of an excursion on the Champs-Elysees soon after his election, adding that he ‘stayed planted in the wind and rain like an idiot’. And she punctures Hollande’s supposed man of the people posturing with deadly detail of his tastes.

He’s a man who ‘prefers to avoid a meal unless it is of premier quality, who doesn’t eat strawberries unless they’re [top quality] Gariguettes, who only eats Noirmoutier potatoes [reputedly the most expensive spuds in the world] and puts boil-in-the-bag meat straight in the bin,’ she recounts.

She sprinkles the book with damaging remarks from her former lover. After meeting the disabled French swimmer Philippe Croizon, she writes that Hollande observed: ‘I don’t like handicapped people who commercialise their handicap.’

Croizon, the first quadruple amputee to swim the English Channel, retaliated by asking: ‘He’d rather that handicapped people continued to live below the poverty line?’

The onslaught of the revelations — prepared amid great secrecy and printed in Germany — has hit Hollande like a bolt from the blue. It comes after a week in which his political credibility had already sunk to a new low, after he dissolved the French government over his squabbles with the cabinet.

Nothing is spared, even if to mention it reflects badly on Mme Trierweiler herself.

She recalls how before one State banquet Hollande asks her: ‘Does it take you a lot of time to make yourself look that beautiful?’ To which she answers: ‘Yes, a bit.’ The President then coldly observes that: ‘Nobody expects any more from you than looking pretty.’

Disdain: Her biting words come after the president left her following an affair with actress Julie Gayet

Now, in revenge, she is merciless in exposing the man with whom she had a nine-year relationship as a shameless opportunist. No aspect of their life together is considered off-limits. Hollande, she says, pestered her ‘incessantly’ about giving him a child. But he was estranged from the four children of his 30-year relationship with ex-partner Ségolène Royal.

‘He missed his children,’ she explains. ‘They hadn’t seen him for months and agreed en bloc to not return while he was with me. I won’t take responsibility for this estrangement. I told Francois that I was happy about a new child, but only if he returned to his own.’

She tells, too, of reading in a biography of the president that he’d ‘confided . . . that he never wanted to have a child with me. I was mortified. He defended himself by saying, “I wasn’t going to discuss our private life.” Another lie and one of the most wounding of all.’ Of course, through it all one person does emerge from these pages, as a paragon of integrity: Valerie Trierweiler.

It was she, readers are told, who had to educate her middle-class partner in the lives of the poor.

‘I led him into the suburbs,’ she claims, telling how she took him to discount stores ‘to make sure that he knew the reality of everyday life which confronts a part of France, those who count each euro’.

She makes common cause with Carla Bruni, the glamorous model-cum-singer wife of former president Nicolas Sarkozy. ‘Carla Bruni never said anything bad about me publicly and I’ve never criticised her.’

But there is a sly dig when Mme Trierwieler refers to the allegations that Sarkozy was bankrolled by former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, revealing that she and Hollande dubbed a room at the Elysee ‘the Gaddafi room because of its green carpets and curtains’.

Trierweiler justifies all the bitchiness, the invasion of her own privacy, because, in the words of that old cliche, she wants to tell the truth.

This is despite the fact that she, an ex-journalist, is a notorious litigant who sued over paparazzi pictures of her in a swimsuit, and over allegations that while married she had been the mistress of two politicians.

All in all, she wants the world to join in her regrets about sharing a life with a man whose presidential veneer hid a private life of grubby deception.

Disdain and disappointment drip from her pen. She threw out Hollande’s old clothes when they moved in together, she relates, giving most of them to homeless charity Emmaus.

Laughingly, she notes: ‘Men dressed by Emmaus walking the streets of Paris with suits which once belonged to the President of the Republic.’

For President Hollande it is not just the clothes off his back that have been removed. So, too, has every shred of his personal credibility.
