The Earth’s nitrogen-rich atmosphere made life possible, but the origins of the air we breathe have long been a mystery.

Now, scientists believe they have found the answer: that tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and volcanoes, also made the atmosphere habitable.

Geoscientists studied tectonic chemistry and found that nitrogen started building up in Earth’s atmosphere three billion years ago.

Tectonic forces responsible for creating mountains and streams of lava from volcanoes (pictured) also made the atmosphere, a new study says. Geoscientists studied the chemistry of what goes on beneath volcanic rocks to work out how so much nitrogen was created

Writing in the journal Nature Geoscience, Carnegie Institution of Washington researchers explained that the chemistry of the air we breathe is the result of billions of years of photosynthesis, as well as tectonic activity. 

While scientists knew that plant life was responsible for the build up of oxygen, which makes up one fifth of the Earth’s atmosphere, the nitrogen content - which accounts for 80 per cent of air - had remained a mystery.

The study explains that when a mass of land is  subducted – or dragged down below the continental crust – it releases volatile elements into the rock above. A subducted tectonic boundary is pictured

To investigate the problem, Dr Sami Mikhail and Professor Dimitri Sverjensky studied how nitrogen travels through rocks in the Earth’s crust, before being vented by volcanoes,The Conversation reported. 

Volcanoes spew large quantities of nitrogen into the air, as well as sulphur, steam and carbon dioxide. 

They say this happens because when a mass of land is subducted – or dragged down below the continental crust – it releases volatile elements into the rock above.

These elements include nitrogen, which is either locked inside rock or released as a gas in an eruption.

Dr Mikhail and Professor Sverjensky say that nitrogen in the Earth’s crust tends to form ammonium ions which are often incorporated into silicate minerals - rock-forming minerals that make up 90 percent of the Earth’s crust.

The process is thought to have affected most of the nitrogen on Earth and almost all the nitrogen on Venus and Mars.

On Earth, the silicate minerals react in the presence of oxygen or oxygen-containing compounds.

When this happens, the ammonium molecules break down into water and nitrogen, which works its way to the Earth’s surface through volcanic vents.

The researchers believe that this would explain why Earth’s atmosphere differs so much to Mars and Venus’.

The alien planets have no plate tectonics and little nitrogen, which led to the evolution of plant and animal life on Earth.

The study also adds weight to the theory that plate tectonics were already active on Earth before nitrogen started to build up in our atmosphere.

The nitrogen works its way to the Earth’s surface through volcanic vents and is spewed out of volcanoes
