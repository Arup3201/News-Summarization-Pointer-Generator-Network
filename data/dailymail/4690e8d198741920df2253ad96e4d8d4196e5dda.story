An avid cyclist, who took up the sport intensively two years and lost 100lbs, died while taking part in one of American's most grueling bike rides.

Nicola Grossi, 42, lost control of his bicycle on the curve of a steep descent and plowed into a tree.

Mr Grossi, of La Mesa, California careered off an embankment around 10.30am on Saturday.

Mr Grossi, a computer programmer, had rediscovered a passion for exercise last year, according to his wife, and lost 100lbs. He would cycle to work every day and take rides along the highway for hours at a time.

Jennifer Grossi told the U-T San Diego: 'They’re talking about canceling this race. And he wouldn't want that.'

Shortly after her husband's death on Saturday, Mrs Grossi posted on Facebook: 'RIP Nicola Grossi. I love you with all of my heart and I will tey [sic] and find comfort in knowing you died doing what you loved most... riding!'

The 42-year-old leaves one daughter and three step-children.

The race was held near Shaver Lake, in the Sierra Nevada about 60 miles northeast of Fresno.

Paramedics and race officials performed CPR but Mr Grossi, who had been wearing a helmet, died at the scene.

Grossi was taking part in the Climb to 
Kaiser - a 155-mile ride that ascends from sea level to  9,200-feet - considered to be one America's ten toughest 
bike rides. He was listed as a 
first-time participant.

Ride organizer John Craft said: 'This is the hardest part of the course as far as the descent goes.

'It is a very steep road, with some corners that you gather up speed real quick.'

Mr Craft said the section of roadway leading to where Mr Grossi crashed is marked with cautionary signs.

In
addition, the event's handout material that maps out directions and 
rest stops states for that area: 'Steep and winding; use caution on 
descents.'

Mr Grossi is the second person to have died on the Climb to Kaiser. In 2003, a cyclist was killed by a pickup truck on the steep descent.
