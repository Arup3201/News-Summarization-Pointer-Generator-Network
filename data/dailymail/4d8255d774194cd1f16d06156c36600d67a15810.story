Single again: Ralf Little as Clint and Miranda Raison as Abbey, when they starred side by side in Married Single Other

She has already been in a relationship with one on-screen partner and dumped him after four years.

Now history is repeating itself for former Spooks actress Miranda Raison, who has split from another co-star – Ralf Little – after another four years.

The couple met on the set of ITV drama Married, Single, Other in 2009, where the actress played a model who captured the heart of Little’s character Clint, a serial womaniser.

But now it appears that Miss Raison is back in the ‘single’ category after she ended the relationship last month.

Last night spokesmen for both stars declined to comment on the break-up – which mirrors almost exactly Miss Raison’s previous relationship with her Spooks co-star Raza Jaffrey.

The couple met in 2005 when Miss Raison was cast as journalist Jo Portman in the BBC spy drama. They formed a close bond as Mr Jaffrey’s character Zafar Younis, an undercover operative, fell for Miss Raison’s character after she was kidnapped, rescued and then recruited by MI5.

The couple were married in September 2007 in Miss Raison’s home town of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, at the same time as Mr Jaffrey left Spooks. But by November 2009, the couple had separated, with sources claiming they found it difficult to adjust to life working on different shows.

‘When they spent all day and all night together on Spooks their relationship was fine, but after Raza left the show it all started to go terribly wrong,’ said one friend.

Soon after the separation was revealed by The Mail on Sunday, Miss Raison was spotted out with Little. The couple were believed to have moved into his £500,000 North London home.

In an interview in 2011, Little, 32, who got his big break playing dogsbody Antony in the BBC sitcom The Royle Family, spoke of his love for Miss Raison, also 32.

Asked what was most important to him, fun, love or money, he replied:  ‘I have to say love, obviously – I’d land myself in hot water with my other half if I didn’t. If you’re having fun, you can love each other for ever.’

Before his relationship with Miss Raison, Little also dated TV presenter Lisa Rogers and actress Sarah Churm.

Miranda Raison also dated and then married former Spooks co-star Raza Jaffrey
