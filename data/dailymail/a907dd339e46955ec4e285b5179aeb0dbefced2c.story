When Pharrell Williams first appeared in his now signature hat at the Grammys, social media was awash with exclaims of ‘Hey, Arby’s called – they want their hat back!’

Well, joke is on them, because the fast-food chain, which has a large red hat similar to Pharrell’s as its logo, has now bought it.

Pharrell put up the iconic Vivienne Westwood creation on eBay and the American sandwich shop won the auction with a $44,100 (£26,444) bid.

Going once, going twice: Pharrell's Vivienne Westwood mountain hat which he wore at the Grammys has been bought by sandwich chain Arby's for $44,100

Bid listing: Pharrell in his eBay listing said the hat would come with a letter of authenticity

Hat shopping: Arby's posted proof of their purchase to Pharrell on Twitter

Shortly
 after the 40-year-old showed up at the Grammys in the British 
designer’s huge fedora, even Arby’s joined in on the Twitter joke, 
asking him to return the hat which looks exactly like the one in their 
logo.

The skyscraping park 
ranger-style headgear became a popular search on Google and even 
inspired its own Twitter account called Pharrell's Hat.

Pharrell put the big brown hat up for auction two weeks ago and promised the winning bidder would receive a letter of authenticity.

The auction notice added that all proceeds would go to Pharrell’s charity for at-risk teens, One Hand to Another.

Work it: Lupita looked thrilled as she watched Pharrell move on to Meryl in the front row

Famous fedora: The original camel-coloured hat was honoured in the background of Pharrell's Oscars performance of nominated single Happy

He's Happy: The award-winning producer sung his feel-good song during the Oscars opening performance

Same, same, but different: It almost looks like Vivienne Westwood was inspired by the Arby's logo when she made the hat

'Hey @Arbys, you want my hat? Now’s 
your chance…,' Pharrell tweeted to his nearly three million followers on
 Twitter as he announced the auction.

After
 the auction closed on Sunday, with the hat sold for more than $44,000, 
the Get Lucky singer tweeted: Thank you to whoever bought my Grammy hat 
on @eBay for $44,100. Your donation benefits From One Hand to Another.’

The sandwich chain posted an image with their winning bid, and tweeted back to Pharrell.

‘You're welcome. We're HAPPY to support a great cause & get our hat back. Good luck at the #Oscars tonight!’

‘What a pleasant surprise. Thank you @Arbys, our roast beef is now officially well done,’ the singer responded.

Iconic: Pharrell Williams and the hat performed with Stevie Wonder at the Grammys in January

Pharrell
 earlier this month busted out a grey version of the $180 Mountain Hat 
while visiting the BBC Radio 1 studios in London and also donned the 
grey version at the 86th Academy Awards nominees luncheon in Beverly 
Hills.

Since his 
camel-coloured mountain hat made an appearance at the Grammys, Pharrell 
has sported a pink, a blue and a grey version of the $180 fedora at 
different occasions.

The 
hat’s most recent appearance at Sunday night’s Oscar performance 
resulted in ‘the shimmy seen around the world’ as Pharrell danced with 
Meryl Streep.

The Oscar 
nominee for Best Original Song for Happy from Despicable Me 2 will 
direct all proceeds from the charity auction to his non-profit From One 
Hand To Another foundation.

The
 foundation helps under-served youths by creating learning centers to 
empower children to learn through new technologies, arts and media.
