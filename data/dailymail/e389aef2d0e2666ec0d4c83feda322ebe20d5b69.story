Louis van Gaal tipped Manchester United to lift the FA Cup after seeing his team cruise into the fifth round with a comfortable victory over Cambridge United at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

The Premier League side won 3-0 to book an away tie against Preston North End and now have a great opportunity of reaching the quarter-finals.

‘We have a real chance now,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Why? We are the highest qualified team in the FA Cup so people are maybe betting on us. I am not allowed to (bet), I am not a casino man – but I give you a tip.

‘Of course, I think the highest qualified teams have more possibilities to win than lower qualified teams. But Arsenal is still in the cup and Liverpool will fight tomorrow (Wednesday).

‘For me, personally, I have always won a title in my first year everywhere I have worked so the chance of winning the title is bigger in the FA Cup than the Premier League.’

However, Van Gaal refused to get carried away at the prospect of facing League One Preston at Deepdale on February 16.

‘Preston is not a piece of cake,’ he added. ‘They won away against a cup fighter like Sheffield United, so it will be difficult for us to win there. 

Tom Elliott had an excellent opportunity to give Cambridge United the lead in the first minute but hit the post

‘Every club in the FA Cup wants to win, and so do we. For the club, the fans and the coach and my staff, we want to win a title this year. The biggest chance is the FA Cup, but we still have to win four games to do that.’

United scored through Juan Mata, Marcos Rojo and James Wilson after surviving an early scare when Tom Elliot hit the post for Cambridge.

Van Gaal added: ‘We gave them a chance in the first minute – it was shaky moment. I’m happy the first chance for Cambridge was on the post.’

Cambridge boss Richard Money was proud of his team’s effort which followed a goalless draw at the Abbey Stadium last month.

He revealed: ‘We said at half-time “what’s the worst that can happen? You get battered? But so what? Go and show what you can do.” Second half we gave them a good game.’
