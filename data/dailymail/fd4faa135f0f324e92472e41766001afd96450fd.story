AN RSPCA whistleblower killed herself after publicly accusing the charity of killing thousands of healthy animals, an inquest heard yesterday.

Animal welfare officer Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, was dismissed after arguing with her manager and later accused the organisation of putting down pets that could not be re-homed.

Just five months after she helped reveal how the RSPCA had destroyed 53,000 animals in a year, the mother-of-four was discovered dead at home.

The inquest heard she was suffering 
from depression after her partner Rob Colclough took his own life in 
October 2011.

She was also experiencing financial difficulties and had 
issues with alcohol when she hanged herself at her home in Martock, 
Somerset, on May 8.

In a 
statement read to the inquest in Wells, Somerset, her father Dennis 
Aubrey said she was ‘deeply distressed’ by the whistleblowing furore.

Summarising
 the statement, coroner Tony Williams said: ‘Following time at the RSPCA
 she was increasingly frustrated with her line manager. That led to 
incidents and her being dismissed by the RSPCA.

Animal lover: Ms Aubrey-Ward, 43, was found hanged at her home in Somerset in May

‘She started a new relationship. She moved in with a new man in her life along with her children.

'Sadly in October 2011 he had himself taken his own life.

'He himself was battling with depression and that Dawn herself was devastated by that and became depressed and needed the support of family and friends around her.'

Allegations: Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, said she was forced to put down healthy pets during two years working for the charity

Miss Aubrey-Ward publicly accused the charity of unnecessarily killing animals in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, published in late December last year.

She had described her horror, during her time as an RSPCA inspector, at having to euthanise what she called ‘healthy animals’.

Mr Aubrey added: 'Dawn expressed she was greatly distressed by that sequence of events.'

She worked for the RSPCA between 2008 and 2010 and had a number of arguments with her line manager before she was dismissed.

While details were not heard in the inquest, it was reported that Miss Aubrey-Ward was rebuked for refusing to issue a formal 'caution' to a devastated pensioner whose cat had contracted emphysema and was dying in his lap.

She was also allegedly reprimanded for the theft of a tortoise, which she claimed to have taken home for safekeeping.

She went public to tell of the horror she faced putting down animals because there was not enough room to house them in shelters.

The RSPCA vigorously denied her claims and issued a statement seeking to discredit her account.

In a statement issued in January, it said: 'Please be aware that Dawn Aubrey-Ward is a disgruntled former employee of the RSPCA who was subject to a disciplinary investigation for alleged theft of animals. She left the organisation with matters still pending.'

Her mother Jean Newport wept as she heard about her daughter's final hours and was supported by her husband Michael and Dawn's father Dennis.

Simon Ward, her husband, was also in court. The pair split up many years ago but were still married.

The inquest heard her car had broken down and she had called her daughter from her first marriage Aimee Redfern-Ward, and asked her to pick up her two younger daughters from school.

Meanwhile a friend gave her a lift home.

She was also experiencing financial difficulties and had issues with alcohol when she took her own life at her hom

When Aimee arrived at the house with her two half-sisters, she discovered her mother's body.

The inquest heard her suicide followed months of visits to her doctor, who prescribed anti-depressants and cognitive therapy sessions.

Community mental health nurse Dee Holbourne said Miss Aubrey-Ward was struggling with bereavement, her finances, alcohol issues and a lack of sleep and appetite.

She also thought she might be suffering from bi-polar disorder, she added.

Recording a conclusion that she took her own life, coroner Mr Williams said: 'All of these pressures that were on her at the time and all of these issues for me go to that question of intent.

'Whilst I absolutely accept that in accordance with Mrs Newport's evidence that Dawn has acted on the spur of the moment without any formulated plan, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to conclude that Dawn did take her own life.'
