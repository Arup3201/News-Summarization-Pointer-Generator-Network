Independent Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie believes 'halal money' may be funding terrorist groups and wants to introduce new Federal laws forcing anyone who has been certified to provide proof they are not sending financial support to the Middle East.

The controversial senator questioned whether halal certification is leading to funds being sent through to militants in Syria and Iraq and is threatening to introduce a private senator's bill to stamp it out.

It follows similar claims from Nationals MP George Christensen, who wrote that consumers who bought halal products could be funding Islamic extremism.

Senator Jacqui Lambie has targeted the sale and proceeds of 'halal products' in a speech delivered in parliament questioning whether funds were being directed to terror groups overseas 

'Given that our enemies in Islamic State are receiving a steady cash-flow to control their caliphate in Syria and Iraq, why isn't there a legal requirement in Australia for halal certification fees to be disclosed?' Senator Jacqui Lambie asked

Senator Lambie claimed she was prompted to look into the issue after receiving hundreds of emails from concerned residents.

A study the Tasmanian senator commissioned the parliamentary library to examine exposed some 'surprising facts' that alarmed her.

Certifiers are not legally required to disclose their fees, nor is there a formal reporting or auditing system to ascertain whether funds are being misused, she said.

'Given that our enemies in Islamic State are receiving a steady cash-flow to control their caliphate in Syria and Iraq, why isn't there a legal requirement in Australia for halal certification fees to be disclosed?' Senator Lambie said.

Two Federal politicans, Senator Lambie (l) and Nationals MP George Christensen (r) have questioned the proceeds of halal products

'And given that our nation is on high terrorism alert, while hundreds of Australian Islamic State sympathisers are fighting our ADF forces in Iraq, why is there is no formal reporting or auditing mechanism in Australia to ascertain whether monies paid for halal certification are misused?'

Senator Lambie warned if the government failed to answer her questions, she would introduce legislation to close such 'legal loopholes'.

'(The loopholes) could allow financing of terrorists and Australia's enemies through halal money,' she said.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted AUSTRAC, the government agency charged with tracking the funding of terror groups, for comment on Senator Lambie's claims.

It comes as the federal government considers another wave of national security laws which could ban a range of groups that 'nurture extremism' such as Hizb ut-Tahrir
