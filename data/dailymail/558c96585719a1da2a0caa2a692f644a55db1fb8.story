A girl of six at her best friend’s birthday party was struck by a Land Rover and killed as she dashed across the road to greet her father.

Excited Lara Fernandes Pontes was being collected by her mother when she ran over to her father as he waited in a parked car.

She did not stop to check traffic and was hit by the vehicle.

Tragic: Lara Fernandes-Pontes, six, was killed as she crossed the road excitedly in Hertfordshire yesterday

Neighbours told how her mother screamed inconsolably as paramedics were called.

Lara was flown to Watford General Hospital by air ambulance but doctors were unable to save her.

Carlos
 Alves, 51, who lives on the street in South Oxhey, Hertfordshire, said:
 ‘The little girl had been at a friend’s party. There were lots of kids 
around.

‘Her mum had gone inside to pick her up while her dad stayed outside in his car with other young children.

‘He
 was parked on the other side of the road … and she came running out to 
greet him and … was hit by the car. It’s very shocking and very, very 
sad.’

Another neighbour, 
Steve McGregor, 26, added: ‘The mother was screaming outside when I got 
home … The air ambulance landed in the field just down from where it 
happened and there were ambulances and police all around.

‘People
 I have spoken to just  heard a big crash and then lots of screams.’ The
 birthday girl’s mother, who asked not to be named, tearfully revealed 
she is already considering moving house to escape the dreadful memories 
of Lara’s death.

Quiet: The suburban street where Lara was killed. Police are appealing for witnesses to the tragic incident

‘We have only good things to say about her. She was my daughter’s best friend and she was in my house all the time,’ she said.

‘I
 am very shaken up by what happened … She was so young. She always had a
 smile on her face. I might have to move because every time I open the 
door I am just going to see her face.’

The
 tragedy happened on Sunday afternoon as Lara emerged from the 
two-bedroom end-of-terrace house on a busy single carriageway. The 
driver and passengers in the Land Rover were not injured but were badly 
shaken.

Lara’s parents, 
29-year-old Andre Pontes and wife Marlene, 28, were not at their 
£300,000 four-bedroom home in the town yesterday and were too upset to 
talk.

But Lara’s cousin, 
Jessica Fernandes Oliveira, 21, said the loss was ‘devastating’. ‘She 
will be eternally missed and remain in my heart, forever treasuring her 
beautiful smile that created wonderful memories in the short time she 
had been with us,’ she said.

Aunt Gabby Araujo, 23, added: ‘I will miss her face lighting up when she was with me.’ Police are investigating the collision.
