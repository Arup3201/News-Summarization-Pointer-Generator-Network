American authorities are using the case of three teenage schoolgirls, with a love of pop music and social media, as a unique opportunity to find out how ISIS is targeting young Westerners online.

Two sisters, aged 15 and 17, along with their 16-year-old friend, from Colorado, were stopped at Frankfurt airport in Germany on October 20 heading for Syria to join the Islamic terror group.

The teen girls were targeted directly via social media by extremist recruiters, the FBI said in a report this week. 

Recruiters are believed to be encouraging young people by providing travel plans and reinforcing their messages in real-time via sites such as Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp.

The suburban apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado where one of the three teenage girls who tried to join ISIS lived with her family. The girls were stopped in October in Germany en route to Syria and returned to their families after being interviewed by the FBI

Online ISIS recruiters are both men and women - who reportedly appeal to teen girls by claiming to be 'ISIS sisters'.

They are believed to be operating in Turkey, Syria and Iraq, officials told CNN. The FBI is particularly focusing on contacts in Syria, having searched the girls' computers for clues. 

Rita Katz, from the SITE Intelligence Group, told CNN that investigators were able to track one of the teen girl's radicalization via her social media posts.

Before she was radicalized, she was asked how often she listened to music, Ms Katz said. The girl said she listened to music and danced for a countless number of hours.

When she was asked about her music-listening habits in a time after she was radicalized, the teen girl stated that music was forbidden. 

ISIS methods of luring teens has included creating hashtags linked to current news events, for example the Ebola outbreak. 

The terrorists also publish videos styled on Hollywood action movies with special effects and voice-overs to entice recruits - stopping short of showing beheadings or extreme violence so as not to deter the initially squeamish.

It is believed that 2,000 Westerners have joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

Among those were the three teens, one of Somali and two of Sudanese descent, from suburban Aurora in Colorado. 

After they were stopped in Germany on October 20 heading for Turkey to connect with ISIS, authorities sent the girls back to Denver.

FBI agents  interviewed the schoolgirls before releasing them to their parents without pressing charges.

The father of one girl condemned her actions and said she was confused about what her role would be if she had actually made it to Syria.

'She told me they were going to get there and somebody is going to contact them,' he said, on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for the girls' safety.

'I ask her, "Who's that person?" She actually didn't have a clear idea about what's going on. They're just like, you know, stupid little girls. They just want to do something, and they do it.' 

The father said he became concerned on October 17, when his daughter's high school called to say she had not shown up for classes. 

He texted her, and she responded that she was just late, but she didn't return home, and her brother mentioned a disturbing Twitter conversation from her account.

'She asked her friends to pray for her because she and the other two girls ... and at that time, I just knew that something really bad was going to happen,' he said. 

Then, he noticed her passport missing. He called the FBI and his state lawmaker, Rep. Daniel Kagan, for help. 

Authorities said the girls had saved their money and stole from their parents to buy their tickets in cash at a Lufthansa counter at Denver International Airport. 

Their overseas trip raised no red flags. The U.S. government doesn't have any restrictions on children flying alone, domestically or internationally. Most U.S. airlines allow children 12 and older to fly alone but often with restrictions on international flights.

The girl left behind her laptop, which showed she had been researching whether minors could travel alone and if an entry visa to Turkey was required.

The father wasn't sure how his daughter, a typical high school girl who likes going to the movies and the mall, was lured to terrorism online. 

Officials have said one of the girls had planned the voyage and encouraged the others to come along. 

The family moved to the U.S. in 2001 and to Colorado three years ago after living in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Less was known about the Somali family, but those close to them said they have been in Colorado for years. Their father, who works as a hotel housekeeper, is from Mogadishu.

Members of southeast Denver's tight-knit East African community are now concerned other children will follow the girls' path.

 The FBI has been investigating whether they had friends or associates with similar intentions.
