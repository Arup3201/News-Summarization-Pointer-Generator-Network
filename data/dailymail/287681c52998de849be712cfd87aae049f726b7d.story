Sunderland have replaced Gus Poyet with Dick Advocaat in a late bid to stave off relegation from the Premier League.

The humiliating 4-0 home defeat by Aston Villa not only came at the expense of the Uruguayan's job, but also leaves the Black Cats a single point above the drop zone. 

Here, Sportsmail looks at how some other clubs have fared after bringing in a new boss at late notice...

Norwich - Chris Hughton and Neil Adams (6 April 2014)

Hughton guided Norwich to 11th in his first season but struggled the following season and was sacked with the Canaries five points clear of the drop in 17th, but with Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea as four of their last five games.

It was always going to be an uphill struggle for youth coach Neil Adams and, despite picking up a point against the Blues, were relegated.

Reading - Brian McDermott and Nigel Adkins (11 March 2013)

It looked like a shrewd move when Reading replaced promotion-winning boss Brian McDermott with Nigel Adkins, who had been somewhat harshly binned by Southampton in January.

But it was too late for the former physio to heal the Royals' season, winning just one of his eight Premier League games as Reading made an immediate return to the Championship.

Hull - Phil Brown and Iain Dowie (15 March 2010)

After the half-time team talk on the pitch and singing to celebrate survival in 2009, Phil Brown's luck finally ran out having won just one of his last 15 games as Hull boss.

He was placed on gardening leave and replaced by former Charlton and Crystal Palace manager Iain Dowie, but the rot had already set in and Hull collected just six more points on their way to relegation.

Newcastle - Chris Hughton and Alan Shearer (1 April 2009)

When Joe Kinnear was required heart surgery in February 2009, Hughton was temporarily placed in charge but only won one of his six games, leaving Newcastle in 18th.

Club legend Alan Shearer was surprisingly parachuted in to turn things around but his only victory came in a 3-1 win against Middlesbrough and the Magpies suffered a shock relegation.

It can work... but beware short-term fixes:

Sunderland - Martin O'Neill and Paolo di Canio (30 March 2013)

O'Neill was dismissed with Sunderland 16th, a point above the drop zone but having played a game more than fellow strugglers Wigan and Aston Villa.

Controversial Italian Paolo di Canio quite literally made his mark — ruining his suit with a knee-slide to celebrate 3-0 victory over rivals Newcastle — and secured a comfortable 14th place.

But that was about as good as it got for Di Canio at the Stadium of Light as he was sacked just five games into the following campaign with his side rock bottom on one point.

Martin O'Neill couldn't find the answers while Paolo di Canio's success at Sunderland was short lived

Fulham - Chris Coleman and Lawrie Sanchez (10 April 2007)

They may have gone seven games without a win but it was a shock when Coleman was sacked with five games to go — especially as Fulham were five points clear of danger.

Former Northern Ireland boss Lawrie Sanchez made a stuttering start but eventually ensured survival on the penultimate day with a 1-0 win over Liverpool.

His reign didn't last long, though, as Roy Hodgson came to the rescue in December 2007 with Fulham still battling against the drop.
