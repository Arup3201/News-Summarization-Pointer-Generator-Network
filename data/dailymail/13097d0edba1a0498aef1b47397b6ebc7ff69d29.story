Ivanka Trump marked off an important milestone in her daughter's life yesterday when she took the three-year-old ice skating for the first time. 

The 33-year-old shared a heartwarming picture of herself, her husband Jared Kushner and their young daughter at the Trump Rink on Sunday afternoon on her Instagram account.

'Today was Arabella's first time ice skating,' she wrote alongside the candid snap. 'Such fun! Even Joseph was cheering from the sidelines! a big thank you to the great team at the #TrumpRink in Central Park!'

Talented trio: Ivanka Trump (R) and her husband Jared Kushner (L) took their three-year-old daughter Arabella for her first ice skating session in Central Park on Sunday 

Baking up a storm: Earlier in the week, the three-year-old was busy in the kitchen making a birthday cake for her father, who celebrated his 34th on Saturday 

In the picture, both Ivanka and Jared, 34, can be seen offering a supportive arm to Arabella, who is sensibly clad in a warm jacket, rose-colored mittens, colorful fuzzy hat and - most importantly - a protective helmet. 

And despite it being her first time on the rink, the youngster looks fairly at easy on the ice, happily standing alongside her parents, while her one-year-old brother Joseph watched from the sidelines. 

It was a busy weekend for the family, who spent Saturday celebrating real estate mogul Jared's 34th birthday. 

On Friday, Ivanka posted a picture of Arabella in the kitchen, whipping up what was no doubt a delicious birthday cake for her father, while wearing a costume inspired by Disney's hit animated movie Frozen. 

Alongside the image, Ivanka joked: 'A shockingly small amount of frosting actually made it past Arabella's lips and on to her daddy's birthday cake!'

In between all of the family-focused fun however, Ivanka, who has been hard at work filming and promoting the current season of Celebrity Apprentice alongside her famous father Donald, and her husband managed to enjoy a rare night off from their parenting duties in order to celebrate Jared's birthday with a trip to the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club in Brooklyn.

The entrepreneur shared a couple of images from their evening out on the town, one of which shows her looking incredibly focused on the game in hand - while dressed casually in a pair of black jeans and a knitted jumper.

It has been a whirlwind few weeks for Ivanka, who enjoyed a relaxing sun-filled holiday in the Maldives with her family over Christmas, followed by a New Year's getaway at her father's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.

Two weeks ago, Ivanka discussed the challenges of balancing a career with motherhood during an appearance on Good Morning America to promote her #WomenWhoWork social media initiative.

'All the women I know, this next generation, they're working hard, not just in a professional capacity but really in all aspects of their life. They're not one dimensional. They're doing things outside of the office and inside of the office and living in this digital age where we really do just live one life 24 hours a day, and I wanted to celebrate that,' she said.

'There isn't this clear compartmentalization that used to exist, where it was work and home. Now it's just one life, and I think that's something really unique to my generation,' she added.

'Coming up in the workforce where we're on the phone with our kids while we're in the office, and yet at home at three in the morning catching up on the work because we made it there to put them to bed.'
