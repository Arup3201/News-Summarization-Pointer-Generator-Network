It was multimillionaire Mitt Romney’s attempt to portray himself as an ordinary guy to Americans, with tales of living a slumdog’s life in France.

But a different picture emerged today of the GOP presidential candidate’s life while serving as a Mormon missionary abroad in the 1960s.

Mr Romney reportedly spent most of 1968 at a Parisian ‘palace for rich people’, which was staffed by a Spanish chef and a houseboy.

‘It was a house built by and for rich people,’ Richard Anderson, 70, Kaysville, Utah, told the Daily Telegraph. ‘I would describe it as a palace.’

Mr Anderson is the son of the Mormon mission president when the former Massachusetts governor stayed during his missionary placement abroad.

The revelations come after last week Mr Romney recalled spending two and half years knocking on doors and defecating into a bucket.

Jean Caussé, 72, met Mr Romney in Bordeaux and told the Daily Telegraph he ‘never knew’ missionaries who ever did such a thing.

‘A number of the apartments I lived in when I was there didn’t have toilets,’ Mr Romney said in Hudson, New Hampshire, reported the New York Times.

‘We had instead the little pads on the ground. OK, you know how that works. There was a chain behind you. It was kind of a bucket affair.’

Mr Anderson claimed Mr Romney’s aides had told him not to speak out about their time together, reported the Daily Telegraph.

The 19th century neoclassical building they stayed in featured chandeliers, stained glass windows and impressive art across the walls.

Christian Euvrard, 72, the director of the Institute of Religion in Paris, which is run by Mormons, told the Daily Telegraph it was ‘very comfortable’.

Mr Romney’s mission to France took him
 through Le Havre, Paris and Bordeaux, promoting a church which now has 
14 million members globally.

The
 Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints now has 36,000 members in 
France and many of them found the faith thanks to missionaries.

Missionary
 work is a central tenet of Mormonism that is required of members and 
52,000 missionaries currently serve in 350 missions globally.
