As the protests slowly begin to die down in Ferguson and other cities around the country, some people are trying to find hope and spread a message of love in the aftermath of the destruction.

Among those people is a high school student, Molly Rodgers, who has begun painting boarded up and damaged businesses in the Ferguson area with positive messages.

This after spending the week helping to clean up the streets of the city.

Amazing teen: Molly Rodgers (above) a 17-year-old high school student, has been painting messages of hope on boarded up and destroyed businesses in Ferguson

Hope: Rodgers writes 'love will win' on the boards, and was out doing this all day Wednesday

Destroyed: One of the businesses Rodgers visited was Cathy's Kitchen, which was vandalized on Monday, but boarded up the next day by residents who volunteered 

'I think there’s a lot more love out here than people realize, so yesterday I went out and bought a bunch of paint, and today I’m here painting up the boarded-up windows,' she told local reporter Ryan J. Reilly. 

She said this as she painted boards outside Cathy’s Kitchen with the phrase 'love will win.'

The establishment, located right next to the Ferguson Police Department, had been vandalized and had windows broken during the protests earlier in the week.

Rodgers, who lives just minutes away in Hazelwood, spent all day Wednesday painting the very same message across the city.

'I think it’s unfortunate, I think it’s really rough, but I think a lot of love has come out of it, a lot of community,' said the wise-beyond-her-years teen.

'It’s been really weird, because it’s like my home even if I live in Hazelwood.'

Winter wonderland: Across town, a boarded up resale shop was painted by the owner

Hopeful message: Karen Gold said she wanted to create a peaceful winter wonderland

Good message: 'I just wanted to make it beautiful and know that we’re still here and that we still support the community,' said Gold

Across town, Karen Gold, who boarded up her own store, the resale shop Honey and Sweeties, was doing the same thing and painting a peaceful winter wonderland.

'I just wanted to make it beautiful and know that we’re still here and that we still support the community,' she said.

'We hope for a peaceful resolution.'

This as the community begins to take the first steps in the long road to recover for this community.
