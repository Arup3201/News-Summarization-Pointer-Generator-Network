The son of infamous Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell was shot on Wednesday morning after an alleged attempted burglary.

Barron Alexander - formerly Barron Gosnell - was shot several times inside the West Philadelphia home shared by a group of undergraduates around 7am.

Police said that Alexander, 22, broke into the home in the Mantua neighborhood while three male residents were home twice that morning and was shot multiple times when he returned a third time.

According to Police Captain John Przepiorka, Alexander had already stolen an X-Box and a laptop and woke up two of the residents when he clambered in through a rear bathroom window.

'He was taking items from the property and a resident from the property woke up startled,' said Przepiorka.

'A struggle started at that point, the resident screamed for help.'

At this point a second man arrived and shot Alexander two or three times with a legally registered firearm.

The third occupant of the house slept through the brawl.

Philadelphia's Action News spoke to a friend of the men who lived in the home and said the man opened fire because he had no other option.

'He said the guy broke into the house and he shot him in self-defense and that's pretty much all I know,' said Pat Bowden.

Witnesses alerted by the sound of gunshots said they saw the suspect run out of the house before stumbling and falling down on the sidewalk.

Litered around the scene were a knife, a wallet and cash - it is not known if they belonged to Alexander or to the residents.

According to Action News, Alexander's mother, Peral Gosnell lives only a few doors down from the three students home and police allegedly discovered the laptop and X-Box there.

Neighbor, Joe Samuel told CBS Philly, 'I heard three or four shots'. While another neighbor, Amanda Nguyen said, 'I looked out my window and there was a guy on the ground, bleeding out.'

Alexander is currently in a critical but stable condition at hospital and is facing charges of robbery, burglary and aggravated assault.

His father, Dr. Kermit Gosnell is currently serving a life sentence without parole after a jury found him guilty of killing three babies born alive at his Philadelphia clinic.

Alexander legally changed his name from Gosnell after he couldn't fine work or an internship because of his father's crimes.
