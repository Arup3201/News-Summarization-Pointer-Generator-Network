Controversial Games Lanes reserved for Olympic athletes and VIPs have been turned off in some parts of London because officials have chosen to use public transport instead, Boris Johnson said today.

The Mayor of London made the announcement on the day the city's transport network faced its biggest test of the Olympics so far as Games spectators and rush-hour commuters travelled together for the first time.

He said he was pleased with the way transport systems such as the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and the Olympic Route Network (ONR), were operating as commuters' worst fears of disruption and congestion failed to materialise.

Change of plan: Officials have turned off some Games Lanes after Olympic VIPs opted to use public transport

'Obviously the transport, we’re pleased with the way it’s working so far,' he said. 'Everybody at London Bridge was working well, the Tube is working well, the ORN.

'Actually, we’ve been able to turn off a lot of the Games lanes because so many people are going by public transport.

'It turns out a lot of the Olympic bureaucrat types who could go in the Games lanes - the "T3 people" as they’re called - are using public transport.

'Jacques Rogge himself (the president of the International Olympic Committee) today took the DLR, I’m proud to say, and was conveyed in stately style and comfort he’d expect on the DLR, and a lot of them are doing that and that is good news.'

Traffic was heavy on many of London's roads today, but experts said there were fewer problems than had been feared before the Games got under way.

Business leaders suggested that many employees may have decided to work from home to avoid the crowds of Olympic spectators.

Guy Bailey, head of employment and employee relations at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said: 'It is a little early to draw defintive conclusions after one commuting session and one wouldn't want to say categorically that this is the way it will be for the next few weeks.

'Flexible working will have played a significant role. It is now an accepted part of working culture and both employees and employers are very used to the concept.

'People have been taking that into account in their planning on how to manage through the Olympics.'

Mr Bailey dismissed suggestions that a company's productivity could be hampered by having more staff working from home.

He said: 'The question is, are people able to get the work done?

'If a business and its staff are more likely to get work done by staying
at home rather than battling on through on what could have been a very 
hot and sticky transport system, there is no reason why working from 
home has any impact on productivity whatsoever.'

Mr Bailey added that more workers may have decided to take holiday during the Olympic Games, reducing the number of commuters on the roads.

'People may be taking holiday to attend the Games or watch them on television,' he said.

'Of course, there are people who could think of nothing worse and they may have decided to leave London during the Games.

'And there may be people who have gone overseas because they are yet to see a British summer and they are looking for some sunshine.'

A spokesman for London Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the number of employees working from home had probably helped traffic move more smoothly than expected.

She also suggested that publicity campaigns, arranged by Transport for London (TfL) and London 2012 organisers Locog, encouraging workers to leave their cars at home also had an effect.

Motorists on the M4 - a major route into the capital - had their journeys disrupted this morning when a serious accident forced the closure of a section of the motorway.

Highways workers closed the London-bound carriageway between junction 5 at Langley in Berkshire and junction 4b near Heathrow airport.

Long queues built up on the motorway, which has a Games lane reserved for Olympic athletes and VIPs on the approach to west London.

Some roads with Games lanes in the capital itself also saw heavy traffic, such as the A40 and A4 in west London and the Canning Town Flyover in east London.

Previous restrictions: Some of the lanes, which were reserved for members of the 'Olympic family', have been opened to all traffic

Data collected at the Trafficmaster control centre, which monitors traffic levels, showed vehicles were moving slowly on many routes into London.

Roads into east London, where the Olympic Park is located at Stratford, were among the busiest.

Half of employers have indicated that they will let their staff work from home during the Olympics, a survey for the CBI has found.

Fifty-seven per cent of firms said they would adapt their employees' hours during the Games and 46 per cent said they would let their workforce time off to attend events.

The survey found that 76 per cent of companies believe the Olympics will boost tourism and 64 per cent expect to see trading either improve or remain the same.

But, when asked a month ago, only 43 per cent of businesses said they had been given sufficient information about the Olympic Route Network.

A spokesman at the control centre said: 'There have been some problems on Waterloo Bridge with congestion and there is very heavy traffic around the Hangar Lane area.

'There are also some delays on the A13 in the West Ham area, but we cannot be sure that this is much different to how traffic levels normally are in that area on a Monday morning.

'Traffic is quite heavy on the A12 at Wanstead, going towards Stratford, and also on the A10.'

The closed section of the M4 was reopened later in the morning, but there were delays of up to an hour for London-bound drivers.

There were also hold-ups westbound on the M4 between Slough Central and Slough West - a stretch of motorway close to Eton Dorney in Berkshire where the Olympic rowing events are taking place.

Also in this area of Berkshire, a lineside equipment problem at Maidenhead led to mid-morning delays to First Great Western rail services between Reading and Maidenhead.

A spokesman for the Highways Agency said: 'There were multiple vehicles involved in the collision on the M4, which happened at about 8.25am.

'The road was fully closed at first, but two lanes were open just after 9am.

'With the exception of the M4, there have been no reported incidents on any scale and traffic has actually flowed quite well.'

Busy: Traffic builds on the Embankment in central London on the first day that rush-hour commuters travelled into London with Olympic spectators

Tube and main line rail services operated well on the whole during the morning peak period, although passengers faced delays of up to 20 minutes at Liverpool Street station because of a broken-down train.

A Transport for London (TfL) spokesman said: 'So far this morning the public transport system and London’s roads are working well as commuters travel to work and spectators travel to the Olympic venues.

'We are closely monitoring the transport network, which will be exceptionally busy this week.

'Today London Bridge, the DLR, Canary Wharf and Bank will exceptionally busy. London Bridge should be avoided.

'Our advice to passengers will be different every day so plan ahead at GetAheadoftheGames.com to avoid disruption and delay to your journey and to make the most of all the Games have to offer.'  

London Bridge station was expected to be very busy this evening with spectators travelling to the equestrian cross country event at Greenwich Park in south east London.

A part of London Bridge is being closed to departing passengers from 6pm to 10pm to minimise congestion.

Those affected are passengers travelling on services bound for Kent, Sussex and Bedfordshire run by the First Capital Connect and Southeastern train companies.

TfL said Olympic events meant the Docklands Light Railway would be particularly busy today as would Canary Wharf and Bank Tube stations.

The Association of Train Operating Companies and Network Rail said main line train companies had provided 565,276 extra seats today, operating nearly 4.16million seats in total.

Hundreds of staff from transport companies were working at London Bridge station, they said.

As of noon today, 93 per cent of services were running to schedule across the network, with services operating normally in and out of Liverpool Street station again after the earlier disruption.
