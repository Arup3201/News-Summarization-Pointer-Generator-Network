A newly proposed bill could ban government workers from watching porn on their office computers in the wake of the revelation that thousands of pieces of pornographic content were downloaded to Environmental Protection Agency computers this May.

The bill was introduced by Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, a Republican, on the last day before Congress' fall recess.

If the bill is passed it 'would require the Office of Management of Budget to issue guidelines to prohibit porn watching on federal computers.'

The Daily Dot reports that the Washington Post contacted an OMB spokesperson who said such a restriction has yet to be passed, though they were 'looking into it.'

The Post noted that the bill is called the Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act.

That the acronym is the same as the Environmental Protection Agency's is no accident.

In May, an investigation found an EPA employee had downloaded and viewed over 7,000 pieces of pornography on government computers.

The unidentified employee spent two to six hours a day watching porn at work on their computer, EPA Deputy Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Allan Williams told reporters.

In the public outcry over the investigation's findings, then-deputy EPA administrator Bob Perciasepe said the agency had 'taken steps to put measures in place to help ensure this type of fraud cannot be repeated.'

Meadows said it was shocking that a bill would be necessary to stop this behavior.

'It's appalling that it requires an act of Congress to ensure that federal agencies block access to these sites at work,' he wrote.
