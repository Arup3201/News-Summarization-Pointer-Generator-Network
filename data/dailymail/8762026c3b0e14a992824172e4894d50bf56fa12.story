Just days before Ohio inmate Dwayne Wilson was to be released from prison he was charged with 14 new counts of rape and kidnapping following cold-case DNA testing.

The 54-year-old has now been ordered to remain in custody, after thousands of previously untested rape kits linked him to the rapes of four adults and one teenager over a three-year period.

Wilson, who was indicted by a Cuyahoga County grand jury last week, was otherwise scheduled to be released on Friday after serving five years in jail for sexual assault.

Ohio inmate Dwayne Wilson was due for release on Friday before cold-case DNA testing linked him to a string of rape and kidnapping offences that involved attacks on victims aged 16 to 34

In the five newly discovered attacks, prosecutors say Wilson pulled up to his victims in his vehicle before sexually assaulting them at either knifepoint or gunpoint. The victims were aged 16 to 34. 

State Attorney General Mike DeWine said Wilson's dark past was unearthed among 5,023 rape kits that have been tested since October 1.

From that batch, there have been 1,861 hits to DNA already in the Combined DNA Index System, authorities said.

Mr Dewine said Wilson's case highlights 'exactly why' the thousands of previously untested rape kits needed to be looked at.

He said: 'Had these kits not been tested, this defendant would have been released from prison and given the opportunity to attack again. Now he's looking at spending the rest of his life behind bars.'

Mr DeWine said he's told law enforcement to send him previously untested kits for testing, free of charge.

Cuyahoga County Assistant Prosecutor Rick Bell, who heads the DNA Cold Case Task Force, praised the testing project as a monumental step in the right direction.

He said: 'We have learned that serial offenders like Wilson simply will not stop committing sexual assaults. 

'By pursuing these indictments and keeping Wilson behind bars, we can not only obtain justice for these five victims, we can ensure that no other women will have to suffer at the hands of this vile cretin.'
