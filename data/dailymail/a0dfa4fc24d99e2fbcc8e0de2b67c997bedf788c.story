As a former hostage of Somali pirates, ex-sea  captain Colin Darch has  a grim tale to tell.

So he was stunned to arrive at a Women’s Institute meeting and find the members wearing eye patches, wigs and fake wooden legs while brandishing plastic cutlasses.

They had been told their 75-year-old guest would be talking to them about piracy – so several turned up in fancy dress.

The horrified women then discovered he
was there to discuss how he was savagely beaten and held at gunpoint 
during a 47-day ordeal in the Indian Ocean in 2008.

But Captain Darch reacted with good humour to the blunder and carried on his talk as planned.

‘They seemed to be a little 
embarrassed but it didn’t offend me in the slightest,’ he said yesterday
at home in Appledore, Devon.

‘It’s been five years now and 
sometimes I have to remind myself just how terrifying and frightening it
was. In any event, the ladies didn’t look the slightest bit like Somali
pirates – more like the Pirates of Penzance.

Speaker: Mr Darch, 75, was held hostage by armed rebels for 47 days in 2008

‘In the end they asked me to select the best costume. I gave them all marks out of ten. It was just a bit of fun.’

Captain Darch was held hostage by 20 
gun-toting pirates after they leapt aboard his Danish ship, the Svitzer 
Korsakov, in the Gulf  of Aden.

Four Russian crew members were ordered
to lie down on the deck but the captain and his Irish engineer, Fred 
Parle, 68, were needed to sail the 115ft vessel.

His haunting account describes how he was struck over the head and warned he would be shot if his crew disobeyed their captors.

He and his fellow hostages were accompanied everywhere they went, even to the lavatory.

Six weeks later a rumoured £350,000 ransom was agreed and the crew were freed.

Captain Darch returned to Devon where 
he was reunited with wife Barbara, 70, and began writing about the 
terrifying episode for a book, Capture By Somali Pirates And Other 
Events At Sea. His talk was delivered to the WI branch in Parkham, a 
village a few miles from his home.

The Parkham WI’s 21 members, whose 
ages range from the mid-40s to the 80s, like to liven up their monthly 
events with fancy- dress competitions.

Spokesman Stephanie George said: ‘We 
didn’t know much about him but the notes said he was  Captain Darch and 
he was talking about piracy.

‘I thought he was from a local 
fund-raising group who dress up as pirates to raise money for charity. 
Naturally everyone was aghast when we realised our mistake.

‘There he was delivering this 
harrowing story about how he was held hostage and feared for his life, 
and we were all sitting there dressed as Captain Hook.

‘We apologised profusely but Mr Darch was a great sport and it didn’t seem to faze him at all.

‘He was so funny and such a nice man. 
He carried on with his talk, which was wonderfully entertaining, and a 
few of the ladies bought copies of his book afterwards.’
