Not even the most experienced bookie could have predicted the odds that were to stack up against promising young jockey Nathan Berry.

The 23-year-old had the world at his feet - the career, the girl and a loving and supportive family - particularly his identical twin brother - and fellow talented  jockey - Tom.

But it all came to a grinding halt when Nathan was struck down with a virus, that only affects one in every million people, which suddenly and unexpectedly took his life in April this year.

Identical twin brothers Nathan and Tom Berry both pursued careers as jockeys

The Berry brothers were inseparable right from the very beginning of their lives

Nathan was born 14 minutes before Tom and were inseparable from the very beginning.

It was almost inevitable that the boys chose a life on the race track as their parents, Julie and John Berry, run a small stable at Warwick Farm in southwest Sydney.

Tom's career took off before his brother's did but there was never a hint of sibling rivalry as Nathan remained his number one supporter.

'I tear up when it talk about Nathan because hes the biggest part of my career,' Tom told 60 Minutes.

'The relationship that twins have - twins will only ever understand.'

But in January this year, Nathan's career rose to new heights when he won the Magic Millions on the Gold Coast in Queensland and he landed a lucrative contract in Singapore.

Not to mention that he was also getting ready to marry his childhood sweetheart - Whitney.

Berry boys: Just like two peas in a pod

Just when life could not have been looking any better, Nathan developed the extremely rare virus, Nore Syndrome, which destroys the brain through constant seizures.

One night during his illness, Tom thought it was looking like his brother was going to pull through when Nathan opened his eyes and began looking around.

'It was very special for all of us - it gave us hope again,' Tom recalls. 

'We were doing cartwheels out the front - literally.'

'It feels like a kick in the guts now though to see that he was that close to getting better and then it dropped so quick.'

His parents admitted that they used to worry about something going wrong on the track - not out of the saddle.

'That's where you would expect it to happen - definitely,' Julie said.

'We lost a very special boy - he gave us so much joy and made us a perfect family and now it's broken.' 

'For a virus to take him it just shocked us - just unbelievable - we still can't believe it, John added.

No one was more devastated than Tom - but he did not let the tragedy stop him from getting straight back on the horse.

Tom is getting ready for the biggest race of his life - riding Sea Moon at the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday. 

'I don't just ride for myself now i ride for him and i feel that,' he said.

'I've got his name on the back of my silks which reminds me every time I put them on that he's there and I'm just so glad I can do what he loved and be successful at what I'm doing and make him proud.'

Asked if Tom has given himself time to grieve the loss of his brother before getting back in the saddle - he simply said he knows no other way.

'I don't know that there is a healthy or right way of dealing with it,' he said.

'I know I'm doing it for him and it helps me get through everyday life - if i wasn't riding I don't know what i would do.'
