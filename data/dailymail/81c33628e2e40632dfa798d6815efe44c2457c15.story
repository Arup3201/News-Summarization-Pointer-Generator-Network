Fast food: McDonald's is considering serving its breakfast menu all day

They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

And if your idea of a hearty start is a sausage and egg McMuffin, then good news - fast food giant McDonald's could be set to serve all day breakfasts.

McDonald's President and CEO Don Thompson said in a television interview that the chain has 'looked at' the idea of serving its breakfast menu all day and that the company's Innovation Centre is coming up with ideas on how to 'expand' current serving hours.

The fast food firm is also considering a loyalty scheme for regular customers, mobile payment systems and even home delivery in a bid to boost sales further.

When asked by a viewer if the chain would consider all day breakfasts, Mr Thompson told CNBC: 'Yes, we would consider it. We have to focus on our existing menu, focus on the delivery of that and great customer experiences.

'But we have looked at breakfast across the day.

'We have it in some markets around the world and our Innovation Centre has come up with some innovative ways for us to expand the breakfast hours and some of these things we'll be seeing in the near future.'

The majority of its UK restaurants currently stop serving breakfast at 10.30am.

But with an increasing number of outlets starting to open 24 hours, breakfast staples such as Sausage McMuffins, fruit and maple oatmeal and breakfast wraps could be served around the clock.

It is not the first time that McDonald's has hinted that it will extend breakfast hours.

In 2006, then CEO Jim Skinner said that the chain was making changes that would see breakfast served 24/7.

There is no suggestion however that customers will be able to purchase other items from McDonald's menu, such as its famous Big Mac, before 10.30am.

McDonald's is also looking to follow rival Burger King's lead by branching out into home delivery and Mr Thompson said that the idea has already been launched in Latin America.

He said that delivery is a 'big, big opportunity particularly in areas where we don't have a Drive Thru.'

Expanding: Breakfast staples such as the sausage and egg McMuffin could be served for longer hours according to the company's CEO Don Thompson

Burger King began delivering to homes in Washington last year and has since expanded the service to several other major cities.

Mr Thompson admitted that McDonald's is a latecomer to ideas such as mobile payment, but he says that the company will learn from others who came to the market before them.

Last year the chain launched the imaginatively titled 'Breakfast After Midnight' programme offering some of its morning menu late at night.

It promoted the idea using the newly coined term 'nocturnivores' created by the fast food chain's advertising agency.

The idea was trialled in 127 outlets in central Ohio.

Although McDonald's announced an increase in profits last week, sales in the US and Europe were weaker than expected.
