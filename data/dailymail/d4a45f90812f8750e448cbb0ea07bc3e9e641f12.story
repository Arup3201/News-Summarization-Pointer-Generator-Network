No your eyes are not deceiving you, that is a man water-skiing across a lake being towed by a plane.

Flying at only 40-feet above the surface, the plane propels the intrepid extreme sportsman along at speeds of almost 60 mph.

To make maters even more impressive, the water skier at Winter Haven, Florida is bare-footed - making the high speed of the plane a necessity.

Terrifying: The expert water skier is being pulled along at speeds approaching 60mph by the sea plane

And, just to top things off, the bare-footed skier launches himself off a ramp, remaining airborne for a good couple of seconds before hitting the water having jettisoned the tow line.

Only a select few at Winter Haven have even attempted this level of stunt, with Keith and Lauren St. Onge, David Small and Ben Groen of Team Devin Supertramp being among the elite club.

Here we go! The skier flies off the ramp - letting go of the two rope before he lands in the waters at Winter Haven in Florida

Smooth: The skier glides across the waters as the plane drags him along at high speed

Another pass: The water skier finds himself approaching the ramp one more time being pulled along by the plane

Brave: Launching into the air for another leap into the unknown - injuries can easily happen with water skiing at this speed

The stress and strain of keeping your body gliding along the water barefooted is physically exahusting according to the skiers of Winter Haven because the boat, or in this case plane, has to travel at higher speeds than for normal water skiers.

The discipline of barefooted water skiing was conceived by A.G. Hancock in the late 1940s and is considered the most dangerous form of the extreme sport.
