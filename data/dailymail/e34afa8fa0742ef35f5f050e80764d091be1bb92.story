Yumi Stynes has hit back at critics who took aim at her following a movie premiere at the weekend, where she took her baby daughter with her on the red carpet wearing a nappy.

Earlier on Monday her husband savaged a newspaper columnist who claimed his wife had committed a 'fashion faux pas' by taking their baby to a high-profile event in a nappy.

Her choice of attire for her youngest child was critiqued by David Campbell, writing for The Daily Telegraph as 'weird'. He also questioned whether a parent 'worth their salt' would be caught without a change of clothes. 

The radio personality said the criticism she received was completely unwarranted and the last thing she was trying to do by letting her youngest daughter Mercy dress appropriately for the warm weather was to draw attention to herself.

Uninhibited: Yumi Stynes attended the Australia premiere of Paddington in Sydney on Sunday, and brought her six-month-old daughter Mercy - who she dressed in only a nappy

'I've been to a pile of premieres this year and am never the most interesting person there. Usually I show up because I'm interested in the film, maybe to write about it, not because I'm desperate to get in the social pages!' Ms Stynes told Daily Mail Australia.

'Yesterday I attended the premiere of Paddington with my husband and three daughters because the two older ones were excited to see the film and my husband loves London. 

'The last thing we expected was to have s*** hung on us for what our 6-month-old was wearing! 

'My littlest girl is a Sydney baby. She was born at the RPA and has spent the entire Spring and Summer getting around in a nappy,' Ms Stynes revealed.

'I don't believe in judging babies by their outfits. More attempts by men to control women, if you ask me!' 

She has hit back at critics calling the attacks sexist and upsetting for her family

The mother of three added that it was not the criticism alone that upset her, but the sexist nature of the attack on an innocent baby.

'The thing that makes me sad is my husband was so proud to see his wife and baby daughter getting their photo snapped on the red carpet,' Ms Stynes said. 

'He thought Mercy was so cute and calm in the face of all those flashing cameras. And then when we saw that article this morning it was so incredibly judgmental and hostile it actually made my hair stand up on end. 

'"Baby wears nappy" is hardly news: it's a breathtakingly sexist attack - and if I am the person who attracts that sort of confected scandal, that's sad for me. But leave my baby daughter out of it,' the media personality said.

Stynes tweeted to Campbell that 'Nicole Kidman dresses up for the red carpet. 'WEIRDLY' my baby doesn't share the obligation.'

Mr Campbell's comments were also rebuffed by Mercy's father Martin Bendeler, earlier on Monday.

Speaking to Mamamia, he said that there was nothing unusual about the little girl being in a nappy, especially on a hot day when temperatures reached 26C.

'If you’re offended by a six month-old’s nipples, you’re weird,' he said. 

Ms Stynes and Mr Bendeler married in 2012 and Mercy is their first child together. The former Channel V presenter also had two older daughters Anouk, 12, and Dee Dee, 10.

She was one of a number of guests who took their children to the Paddington premiere and was worried that her baby would get too hot. Mr Bendeler said that his wife had a blanket with her in case Mercy got cold. 

However, Mr Campbell, who has two children, claimed that the child's attire looked 'plain weird'. 

'It's important that men keep telling women how to dress and what to wear @DaveyCampbell85. Even 6-month-olds,' Stynes tweeted.

'There was only one fashion faux pas on the red carpet... it wasn’t a celebrity revealing a little too much. It was a baby wearing nothing but a nappy,' he wrote, saying the only excuse would be a 'poo explosion - a bowel movement that requires not only a nappy change but a full wardrobe change.'

Mr  Campbell said that as a father of two children, and expecting another, he would have ensured that his kids would have worn at least a singlet and nappy cover. 

The Paddington premiere, though a red carpet event at Event Cinemas on George Street, was a casual affair, attended by celebrities and their children, as well as ordinary families.

Most were dressed in summer attire, and Nicole Kidman, who stars in the film, was the only frocked-up celebrity on the carpet. 

Ms Stynes expressed outrage at the comments, tweeting to Campbell that 'Nicole Kidman dresses up for the red carpet. 'WEIRDLY' my baby doesn't share the obligation.' 

'It's important that men keep telling women how to dress and what to wear @DaveyCampbell85. Even 6-month-olds,' she commented.
