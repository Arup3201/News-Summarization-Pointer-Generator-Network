The Wanted singer Nathan Sykes is to undergo specialist surgery to save his voice.

Sykes, is suffering from a 'haemorrhaging vocal cord' the same condition that threatened to wreck singer Adele's career.

Instead of celebrating his 20th birthday, the young star will go under the surgeon's knife in Los Angeles on Thursday.

Vocal Cord Haemorrhage results when one of the blood vessels on the surface of the vocal cord ruptures and the soft tissues of the vocal cord fill with blood. It is considered a vocal emergency and is treated with absolute voice rest until the haemorrhage resolves.If left untreated the condition may result in scarring of the vocal folds, which is a condition that is much harder to treat and has permanent effects on voice quality.

In cases where a haemorrhage produces a polyp - or blood blister - on the vocal cords that doesn’t go away, the polyp can be removed with microlaryngoscopic surgery.

Doctors use a laryngoscope to see the vocal cords, and microscopic instruments are inserted through the mouth.

Syke had battled with throat issues for a
while but after an appointment with a specialist, he was instructed to 
have almost immediate surgery.

The group's publicist said in a statement: 'We 
can confirm that The Wanted's Nathan Sykes will under go specialist 
throat surgery on Thursday April 18 in Los Angeles and as such will be 
taking an unforeseen hiatus form The Wanted.

"The priority for Nathan, his label and management is that he is given time to recover and receive the best treatment possible.'

The operation means that Sykes won't be 
able to talk for a month, let alone sing, ruling him out of recording 
sessions for the  band's new album, and potentially their world tour 
which was due to start later this year.

And the band are also in the middle 
of filming a TV show for E! Entertainment in the US, with a new album 
scheduled to drop in early summer.

A source close to the star told 
MailOnline: 'It came as a shock to the boys, and 
they want to get behind him as much as possible and help speed his 
recovery. They're staying positive for him.

'The rest of the band will go on as they have so many 
worldwide commitments they have to carry on.'

It has been speculated that Sykes will have his 
operation carried out by the surgeon who successfully operated on Adele.

However Adele's surgery took place at
a hospital in Boston, Massachusetts by the surgeon who previously treated Julie Andrews, Cher and Roger Daltrey of The Who.

The Grammy Award winner went to Boston to undergo the surgery with Dr Steven Zeitels, director of the hospital's Voice Centre.

She has since made a stunning return to the musical arena, with her James Bond theme Skyfall proving her voice is better than ever, and garnering her an Oscar, and a Golden Globe Award for her vocal performance.

The Wanted formed in 2009 have enjoyed massive success in the UK and more notably the US.

Bandmembers Max George, Nathan Sykes,
Tom Parker, Jay McGuiness and Siva Kaneswaran are signed to Island 
Records in the UK and Mercury Records in the US, and share the same manager as 
Justin Bieber.

Their debut album, The Wanted, peaked
at No.4 in the UK, spawned three UK top twenty singles and All Time Low
hit the UK No.1 spot.

Their second No.1 Glad You Came topped the singles chart in the United Kingdom for two weeks, and in Ireland for five weeks.

Glad You Came sold three million 
copies in the US and hit No.3 on the Billboard Hot 100 whilst  follow up
singles Chasing The Sun and I Found You reached the top spot on the 
Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart.

The news comes soon after it was revealed that Sykes has split from singer girlfriend Dionne Bromfield.
