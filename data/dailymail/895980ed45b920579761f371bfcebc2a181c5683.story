Ringo Starr and his wife, former Bond Girl Barbara Bach, are trying to unload a big portion of their real estate.

Just last week, Starr put his palatial country estate in Surrey, England on the market for over $20million, and now it seems like he is also trying to find a buyer for his Colorado ranch.

That property has been listed at $3.85million, making it the second time the famed Beatles drummer has tried to sell the property in two years.

On the market: Ringo Starr is selling his Colorado ranch for $3.85million

Moving on: Star and wife Barbara Bach (above) are said to spend little time at their Colorado residence

Second time's the charm: Starr tried to sell the property for the same amount last year

Tranquil: The ranch is located in Woody Creek, 30 minutes outside Aspen

Starr's ranch, located about 30 minutes outside Aspen in Woody Creek on 15.8 acres, sits on the banks of the Roaring Fork River.

There are three bedrooms, a living room that features vaulted ceilings, exposed wood beams and a neat rock fireplace, and a kitchen with, according to Curbed, 'pretty blue tile countertops.'

There is also a horse pasture on the grounds.

Lush grounds: The property sits on 15.8 acres and has a horse pasture

Interior: It also has three bedrooms and a large living room 

Big money: Starr bought the property in 1991 for just under $1.2million

Nature: The ranch sits on the banks of the Roaring Fork River

Starr tried to sell the property last year as well for the same exact price, a big step up from the $1.164million he paid for it in 1991.

The Surrey estate meanwhile is a 17th-century mansion that sits on 200 acres of land, and was purchased for just $3.1million by Starr in 1999.

That means he is set to take home over $17million should it sell for its asking price.

There is an indoor pool, a screening room, a helipad, five reception rooms, a spa, and eight bedrooms and seven bathrooms spread out across the 18,332-square-feet.

For sale: Starr is also selling his estate in Surrey for $20million

The couple say they are unloading the properties as they are mainly living between their flat off the King’s Road in London and their American residence in California.

'We have spent 15 years at Rydinghurst and will always have wonderful memories of our time there. It is a beautiful home with some very special features, but we are, reluctantly, unable to spend as much time there as we would wish,' Starr told The Sunday Times.

‘With commitments in American and our family all in England, we will continue to divide our time between Los Angeles and London.’
