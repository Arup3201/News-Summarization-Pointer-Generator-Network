A retired LAPD detective, who has claimed for years that his father was responsible for the infamous Black Dahlia murder, has unveiled fresh new evidence which he says links his dad to as many as ten other unsolved Hollywood murders from the 1940s.

Since retiring as a cop, Steve Hodel has written about unsolved crimes and it was in his 2003 book Black Dahlia Avenger, that he first made the claims that his father George Hodel, a doctor, was the killer.

In November 2012, Hodel was able to visit his childhood home in L.A. with a cadaver dog who picked up faint traces of human remains in four locations in the basement.

Retired LAPD detective Steve Hodel, who has claimed for years that his father was responsible for the infamous Black Dahlia murder, has unveiled fresh evidence which he says links his dad to as many as ten other unsolved Hollywood murders from the 1940s

Now chemical analysis of soil taken from the home has added further support to Hodel’s suspicions about his late father.

‘I see him as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,’ Hodel told NBCLA. ‘Unfortunately, the monster, Mr. Hyde, was stronger and over-ruled the good.’

He believes his father may well have been a serial killer responsible for as many as 10 long-unsolved slayings of young women in Los Angeles in the 1940s.  

Since retiring, Hodel has devoted his time to researching unsolved crimes in which he believes his father may have been involved.

After his father’s death in 1991, Hodel came across evidence that he believe implicated his dad in the 
infamous 1947 dismemberment murder of Elizabeth 
Short - aka the Black Dahlia.

George
 Hodel was one of countless suspects in the high profile 
murder case. The police even planted a listening bug at the distinctive Sowden House in the 
Hollywood foothills, where the family lived.

Transcripts reveal that
 detectives heard Hodel discussing the Dahlia case at one point, while another 
time they picked up noises from the basement which sounded like a woman being 
attacked.

Hodel’s father fled to Asia in the late 1940s, leaving his family behind.

Steve
 Hodel had long believed that his father committed murders in or 
near the house, and in some cases buried the remains nearby.

While Elizabeth 
Short’s remains were all accounted for, Hodel has a list of unsolved murder victims that he believes his father could have killed.

Black Dahlia: The body of Elizabeth Short had been severed at the waist and completely drained of blood, her face had also been slashed from the corners of her mouth toward her ears

Steve Hodel believes actress Jean Spangler, left, may have been a victim of his 'serial killer' father, while forensic anthropologist Arpad Vass, says the samples taken from the Hodel residence could be from the same time period

Top of his list is the actress Jean Spangler, then 26, who vanished in 1949. Her body was never found, although her purse was discovered not far from the Hodel home. 

A note inside hinted that she 
was considering having an abortion, then illegal. Dr. Hodel was one of the 
few physicians who then performed abortions in Los Angeles.

In his research, Steve Hodel discovered that Spangler and his father had a
 mutual friend.

In November 2012, Hodel, together with retired police Sgt. Paul Dostie and Buster, a Labrador retriever trained to detect the 
unique smell of human composition, visited his childhood home.

Once
 let loose, Buster quickly established four locations in the basement 
where he could pick up a faint trace of human remains.

The basement had never been finished and since the floor was still dirt, soil samples were taken.

According
 to forensic anthropologist Arpad Vass, PhD, a pioneer in chemical 
analysis of human decomposition, those samples are 'consistent' with 
Steve Hodel's theory of homicide victims buried in shallow graves 70-80 
years ago.

'The soil 
came up positive for human remains because there are a number of human 
specific markers,' said Vass from his laboratory in Oak Ridge, 
Tennessee.

Hodel would like 
to search further for the human remains, but has been unable to get 
permission to go onto the privately owned hillside.

The shocking murder of Elizabeth Short, known as the Black Dahlia, is one of the oldest unsolved murder cases in Los Angeles history.

On Jan. 15, 1947, Short's severely mutilated body was discovered in a vacant lot near the intersection of 39th Street and Norton Avenue in South Los Angeles.

The body had been severed at the waist and completely drained of blood. Her face had been slashed from the corners of her mouth toward her ears, creating an effect known as a ‘Glasgow smile’. 

Not long before her death, Short was arrested in Santa Barbara for underage drinking and this police mugshot was taken

Short, 22, also had multiple cuts on her thigh and breasts, where entire portions of flesh had been removed. The body had been washed and cleaned and had been ‘posed’ with her hands over her head, her elbows bent at right angles, and her legs spread.

The gruesome murder generated masses of media interest at the time. The newspapers of the day, which had a habit of nicknaming colorful crimes, started referring to Short as the Black Dahlia after the then popular film The Blue Dahlia.

To add to the case’s sense of mystery and intrigue, both LAPD officials and newspaper editors received taunting notes believed to be from Short's killer.

The Los Angeles District Attorney office drew up a list of 25 people it considered viable suspects, although as many as 60 people have confessed to the murder at one time or another.

Elizabeth Short's mutilated body was found in a vacant lot near a busy intersection on the southwest section of L.A. in 1947

In his 2003 book ‘Black Dahlia Avenger,’ Steve Hodel first made the claim that his father, a doctor, was responsible for the murder.

George Hodel had been a suspect in the original case and investigators had even planted a bug in the house to listen for incriminating admissions. But before authorities brought charges, Dr. Hodel abruptly abandoned his family and relocated to Asia. He died in 1991.

Steve Hodel believes his father killed the Black Dahlia at the family’s then home, the distinctive Sowden House in Hollywood, which is largely unchanged and looks the same as it did at the time of the murder.

Hodel was also able to establish that he and his siblings had been away with their mother at that time.
