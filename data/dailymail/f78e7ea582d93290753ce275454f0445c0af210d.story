A young woman has appeared in court today accused of helping her best friend to kill herself.

Milly Caller, 22, is accused of assisting her best friend Emma Crossman to die, by providing her with the gas container she used to take her life earlier this year.

The 21-year-old's body was found by police at the flat she shared with her boyfriend in Sleaford, Lincolnshire on January 15.

Emergency services had rushed to the property, but Miss Caller was pronounced dead at the scene.  

Today, Caller appeared at Lincoln Magistrates' Court to face one charge of assisting the suicide of another.

Wearing a black jacket and black trousers, she spoke only to confirm her name and address during the short five minute hearing.

She entered no plea and was given unconditional bail until her next appearance at Lincoln Crown Court on October 30.

Caller, from Sleaford, was escorted from the building by a male friend before being whisked away from court in a red Audi A4.

Speaking after the charges were made earlier this year, a spokesperson for Lincolnshire Police said: 'Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, Lincolnshire Police have charged 22 year old Milly Caller from Great Hale with assisting the suicide of another.

'The charge follows her arrest on January 15, 2014 in connection with the death of 21 year old Emma Louise Crossman.'

Caller is the second youngest person to be arrested and charged with the offence in Britain.

Last year Kevin Howe was found guilty of assisting the suicide of his friend, Stephen Walker, in October 2013.

The 20-year-old was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment after helping the the 30-year-old set fire to himself.  

Following the tragedy neighbours and friends paid tribute to Miss Crossman - who was said to have no obvious health issues.

Sue Price, 33, who lived on the same street, described her as a 'happy and bubbly' girl.

She added: 'She just seemed so lovely, happy and bubbly all the time.

'Emma lived there with her boyfriend I believe and we used to see her going out with her dad.

'We never expected anything like this - it’s an absolute tragedy, she was so young.”

Writing on Miss Crossman’s Facebook profile page, John Ridley said: 'I will never forget you as I look up into the sky.'

Ob Ob Obrien added: 'Heaven’s most beautiful angle sleep tight emma x x x.' 

Assisting suicide is allowed in Switzerland, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, and some US states permit doctor-assisted suicide.

But it is illegal in Britain and carries a maximum jail sentence of 14 years.

In 2009, a Crown Prosecution Service change in policy set out new guidelines which took into consideration public interest in prosecuting suspects arrested over assisting suicide.

Caller is the second person to be charged with the offence since the change in guidelines.
