Tearful: Gordon Ramsay has admitted he cried after his New York restaurant, The London, lost both its Michelin stars

With his impassioned outbursts in the kitchen, Gordon Ramsay has been known for reducing others to tears.

But the celebrity chef reveals he was the one reaching for his tissues when his New York restaurant was stripped of both its Michelin stars.

Gordon Ramsay says he was 'very emotional' after The London lost its prestigious two-star rating last year.

Michelin withdrew the much-desired stars and branded the food served at the posh Manhattan eatery as 'erratic'.

During his appearance on a Norwegian television show, the 47-year-old chef said: 'I started crying when I lost my stars. It's a very emotional thing for any chef.

'It's like losing a girlfriend. You want her back.'

The downgrading of The London came just months after Ramsay's contract for the Art Deco dining rooms at Claridges came to an an end.

Following a decline in ratings for his Channel 4 show, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, the celebrity chef has also decided not to renew his contract.

But Ramsay, who owns 12 restaurants around the capital,Â  can at least console himself with the fact his other restaurants worldwide currently hold a total of 14 Michelin stars.

His signature restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, in Chelsea, has held three Michelin stars since 2001.

Petrus in Belgravia, Maze in Mayfair and Savoy Grill in Covent Garden also boast one Michelin star each.

Internationally, Gordon Ramsay at The Trianon Palace, France, holds two stars, while The London in West Hollywood and Gordon Ramsay at Conrad Tokyo both have one star.

Michelin stars have been awarded for more than 100 years by critics in The Michelin Guide.

One star is considered 'very good', while two is 'excellent' and three is rated as 'exceptional cuisine'.
