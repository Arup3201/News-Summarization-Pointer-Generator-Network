Islamic State extremists have set up a new learning centre in Syria dubbed 'Osama Bin Laden' school.

The religious school, named after the mastermind of the the 9/11 attacks and former leader of Al Qaeda, has been set up in a town held by ISIS militants.

It comes as new pictures emerged showing the beheading of three civilians in Raqqa, another of Islamic State’s strongholds in the war-torn country.

Brutal: Pictures have emerged showing the beheading of three civilians in Raqqa, one of Islamic State’s strongholds in Syria

Disturbing: An executioner holds his sword aloft as armed guards watch on in front of an all-male crowd

The public executions were carried out with the victims accused of 'cursing God' and committing 'sorcery'.

The school has been opened in Manbij, a small ISIS held town in northern Syria.

The facility has already started religious instruction classes for residents living in the town, offering classes in Islamic State’s extremist brand of Sharia law.

A short propaganda video was also released by the provincial media branch of Islamic State.

The five minute film, entitled 'Sharia Educational Session for the Teachers', features brief interviews with a few residents of Manbij, discussing their opinions about the apparent positive benefits of the new religious school.

Manbij was once a Free Syrian Army (FSA) stronghold before it was overrun by ISIS. 

Several young children can be seen watching from the front of the crowd while a number of masked gunmen also appear to be standing guard, monitoring the execution

The three civilians were reportedly put to death in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa for 'cursing God' and 'sorcery'

Fierce fighting with the FSA forced ISIS into its first withdrawal in January 2014. However the extremist group regrouped and re-captured the strategic town 18 days later.

Kurdish forces have repeatedly tried to capture the town but have come up short against tough Islamic State resistance. 

The Kurds have recently called upon the Free Syrian Army to join them in their efforts to re-take Manbij.

In a rare act of defiance, locals in Manbij even demonstrated against Islamic State in May 2014, angered at the militant group’s harsh rule of governance over the city. 

However the town remains under control of the extremist group.

Any rare acts of rebellion or questioning of Islamic State have always been brutally dealt with by the extremist group. 

Recent photos of the execution of three civilians for 'cursing God' and 'sorcery' epitomise the brutal regime being maintained by Islamic State. 

The victims were beheaded in front of a crowd of Muslims 'to serve as a deterrent to those who dare to criticise Allah,' it has been reported.

The images show a large all-male crowd standing near the main square in Raqqa, where corporal punishments, like beheadings and crucifixions, have previously been carried out for crimes against the Islamic State.

Several young children can be seen watching from the front of the crowd while a number of masked gunmen also appear to be standing guard, monitoring the execution.

One photo shows an IS fighter, wearing a black balaclava, reading out the victims' crimes through a small black handheld microphone.

All three of the victims are shown wearing a red blindfold and have their hands tied behind their back. 

They appear to have been individually led to the execution block, a crude hand cut log with a raised notch for the victims to rest their head on.

The black flag of Islamic State can be seen flying from a tall flag pole in the background, near one of the main streets.

The executor is masked and wearing a pair of sandy-coloured military issue boots. 

The photos show the executioner holding a curved sword above his head.

A small blood trail can be seen near the back of a nearby pick up truck. Its white boot has been left open so the bodies can be taken away from the execution site.

Like Minbaj, Raqqa has been one of the main bombing targets by the US-led coalition last month. 

The headquarters of Islamic State were reportedly bombed yesterday in Raqqa. 

The building, situated in the southern part of the city had been evacuated and no militants were reported to have been killed in the nine air strikes on the city.

Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the air strikes with the British based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting that the recent strikes on Manbij had been a failure.
