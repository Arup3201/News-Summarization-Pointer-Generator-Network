From soggy bottoms to hot baps, innuendo has become as much a part of the Great British Bake Off as the cakes, bread and biscuits.

But some viewers think it has gone a double entendre too far.They have complained to the BBC about ‘constant smutty remarks’, saying they make it embarrassing for families to watch together.

The BBC has been keen to use the risqué subtext as a selling point for the show, with the official BBC1 Twitter account creating the #BakeOffInnuendo hashtag for fans to discuss the jokes and even naming their ‘Innuendo of the Week’ from each episode.

Double act Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins (right) have come under fire for their saucy presenting style on the Great British Bake Off 

Last week’s winner was judge Paul Hollywood’s explanation of why crimping – sealing the edge of a pie – is so important: ‘The crimp is critical… To stop any leakage from the meat.’

However, some audience members are less impressed and they turned to BBC programme Points of View to air their concerns.

The show, which examines viewers’ opinions on BBC content, received this letter from Barbara and Robin Phelps: ‘[We are] tired of the constant smutty remarks of the two hosts, Sue Perkins (mostly) and Mel Giedroyc (sometimes). Please ask them to stop spoiling an otherwise delightful programme.’

Throughout the five series of the show, the comedy duo have come out with such lines as: ‘Stand away from your hot baps’, ‘You have got two hours to pop Mary’s cherry’ and ‘Stop touching your dough balls’.

Sue laughed off complaints saying she was more worried about her Dutch accent impression

While some viewers like this aspect of the programme, those contacting Points of View said it makes them uncomfortable. 

Shirley Fooks complained: ‘They get smuttier and smuttier, and it’s totally unnecessary ... Mary Berry looked quite embarrassed on the first programme of this series, and so were we as a family.’

The programme’s companion show, An Extra Slice, which sees a panel of celebrity guests discuss the most recent episode with comedienne Jo Brand, also came in for criticism. 

'We all know what makes a great drinks party. Keys in a bowl.' - Sue 

'OK bakers. You're halfway through. It's very much in the baking interval. Bring out the dancing girls with the segmented oranges. Half time.' - Sue

'Wow. Derriere comme une peche.' (bottom like a peach) - Sue 

'Keep an eye on your jugs.' - Mel 

'Bakers are doing their best to get an extra inch.' - Mel

'Time to slap those baps down.' - Sue

'Get those ladyfingers soggy.' - Sue

'There it is looking perfectly stiff.' - Mary Berry showing Paul Hollwood how to whisk his egg white 

Points of View showed several controversial clips including one where Mel and Sue told the contestants they had to pop Mary Berry's (second left) cherry, also pictured with judge Paul Hollywood

Viewer Jean Harris said: ‘It seemed full of innuendo, it was lewd, it was mucky, why don’t we just call it the Jo Brand show and then just forget baking?’

Miss Perkins, 45, tweeted a response to the complaints: ‘Mel/Sue complaints on POV don’t bother me, it’s the European Parliament’s ruling on our “Dutch” accents I’m dreading...’ referring to an episode earlier this series when they put on mock-European accents.

The BBC has received seven complaints regarding the show’s innuendo, compared to more than 800 about ‘bin-gate’ when a contestant was sent home after throwing away his melted baked Alaska.

A spokesman for the Great British Bake Off declined to comment.

Mel and Sue even made a kinky joke about being locked up in 'a love dungeon' with married Paul Hollywood

Gardening programmes are being forgotten as the BBC prioritises cookery shows, according to disgruntled viewers.

Points of View compiled figures showing the Corporation broadcast 21 hours of cookery-related shows last week but only two and a half hours of horticulture.

Viewers complained on POV that this ‘sends a message that gardening is second class’. Others criticised how often Gardeners’ World is rescheduled on BBC2 if it conflicts with sporting events and the fact that it has been moved to later in the evening schedule.

However, a BBC spokesman said it had been responding to viewer feedback and more actually watched the show in a later slot.
