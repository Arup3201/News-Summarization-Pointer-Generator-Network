Magma in the depths of a super-volcano will eventually burst out like a beach ball held under water, scientists have said.

Such a scenario would cause a massive eruption that could happen sooner rather than later and more frequently than previously thought.

Swiss researchers have simulated 1.2 
million eruptions to work out the change in pressure required to cause a super-volcano to blow its top, New Scientist reported.

Such a scenario would cause a massive eruption that could happen sooner rather than later and more frequently than previously thought, they warned. A standard volcanic eruption is pictured

Super-volcanoes can eject more than 1,000 cubic kilometres of material at once, covering a continent in ash, but the last time this happened was around 75,000 years ago.

These rare events represent the biggest natural catastrophes on Earth except for the impact of giant meteorites.

Normal volcanic eruptions are powered by magma entering the volcanic chamber, which increases pressure building up inside and leads to an explosion.

However, super-volcanoes’ much larger chambers have flexible walls so that they can expand without exploding as magma enters.

Super-volcanoes' large chambers have flexible walls so that they can expand without exploding as magma enters. A super volcano of the magnitude of the eruption that happened 600,000 years ago that shaped Yellowstone Park (pictured) could lead to a 10°C drop in temperature across the globe for 10 years

To find out the pressure change and flow of new lava needed to trigger a super-volcano eruption, a team led by Luca Caricchi of the University of Geneva in Switzerland simulated 1.2 million eruptions.

Their model showed that the chamber is gradually filled with magma, which is less dense than the cooler crust around it, but it eventually bursts though the top in a dramatic eruption.

Professor Caricchi believes that scientists could estimate the risk of a blast by monitoring the magma in super-volcanoes.

The research predicts that a super eruption will occur between 10 and 100 times more often than previously estimated.

Another study, by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich recreated these conditions in a lab to see what it takes to trigger a super-volcano explosion.

They squeezed silicates to pressures of 36,000 atmospheres and heating them to temperatures of almost 1,700 °C to do this.

A super-volcano eruption could have a major impact on the global climate. The Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1992 (pictured), which was 100 times weaker than the a super-volcano eruption, decreased the global temperature by 0.4°C for a few months

Super-volcanoes represent the biggest natural catastrophes on Earth except for the impact of giant meteorites.

Scientists
 from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, have discovered 
that the spontaneous eruption of a super-volcano could be driven solely 
by magma pressure without the need for an external trigger.

Super-volcanoes
 have a much larger magma chamber and are always located in areas where 
the heat flow from the interior of the Earth to the surface is very 
high.

Consequently the magma chamber’s shape changes as it fills with
 hot magma, allowing the pressure to dissipate so that the 
super-volcanoes don’t erupt very often.

But an extra pressure caused by different densities of solid rock and liquid magma could cause an eruption.

The
 researchers’ measurements showed the pressure resulting from the 
different densities of rock and magma could crack more than 10km of 
the Earth’s crust above the chamber.

The silicates became less dense than solid rocks at the surface so that large volumes of them could breach the crust, just as Professor Caricchi’s team suggested.

Wim Malfait, who led the Zurich research said: ‘They come more or less to the same conclusion – that buoyancy is the only real trigger that can work in very large magma chambers.’

He said that super-volcano eruptions may occur spontaneously, driven only by magma pressure without the need for an external trigger, according to the study published in Nature Geosciences.

A super-volcano eruption could have a major impact on the global climate.

The Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1992, which was 100 times weaker than the well-known super-volcano eruption that occurred 600,000 years ago in what is now Yellowstone National Park, decreased the global temperature by 0.4°C for a few months.

The predictions for a super volcano are a fall in temperatures by 10°C across the world for 10 years.

However, eruptions only take place every 100,000 years or so and Dr Malfait said: It's not something that we should worry about in our personal lives.
