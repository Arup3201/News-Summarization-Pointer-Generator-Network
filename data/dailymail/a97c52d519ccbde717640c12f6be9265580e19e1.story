In a month marked by dark, frosty mornings and grey afternoon skies, these spectacular orchids provide a welcome splash of exotic colour.

The Royal Botanic Gardens in Richmond, Surrey, are a riot of pinks, purples and greens as staff at Kew put the finishing touches to a host of elaborate displays ahead of its orchid festival, which opens this weekend.

Visitors can absorb the sights and scents of the sea of exotic blooms from Saturday until the festival closes on March 3.

Riot of colour: Horticulturist Elisa Biondi tends to a display of vanda orchids ahead of the 2013 orchid festival at Kew Royal Botanic Gardens in London

Showcase: Thousands of magnificent orchids will be on display at the gardens throughout the event

The fragrant festival, which coincides with the most romantic day of the year, Valentine's Day, features archways festooned with the ornate flowers, as well as towering pillars of vanda and phalaenopsis orchids inside the Princess of Wales Conservatory.

A waterborne tribute to the Victoria amazonica - or giant waterlily - will form the centrepiece of the displays at Kew Gardens.

Along with the orchids, the festival will also feature an array of 550 flowering plants and 350 varieties of foliage plants.

Further respite from the drab days of winter came from a crop of colourful pansies in West Sussex. The carpet of yellow and purple blooms at Roundstone Nursery near Chichester made for a cheerful sight despite the ongoing icy temperatures.
