Sachin Tedulkar's 15-year-old son could be a chip off the old block judging by his exploits in a school tournament in India.

Arjun Tendulkar hit 118 from 42 balls for Dhirubhai Ambani International School Under 16s to take them into the semi-finals of the Smaaash Master Blaster School Cricket Championship.

His proud father tweeted about it afterwards, posting: 'Arjun did smash the ball during his knock at the Smaash Master Blaster Tournament'.

Tendulkar Snr will be handing out trophies at the finals day of the schools' competition.

Last year he asked that his son - who bats left-handed - be allowed to play cricket as any other normal teenager, without scrutiny.

Tendulkar, who retired from cricket last year, said: 'My son has just started his career and it’s a humble request to let him live his life like a normal 14-year-old, without thinking about anything else but falling in love with the sport.'

However, Arjun will command more attention after this knock and there will be some who will expect him to be added to the number of Test-playing fathers and sons, such as the Broads, the Marshes and the Cairnses.

Sachin Tendulkar was used to scoring centuries, including this one against Australia in 2010
