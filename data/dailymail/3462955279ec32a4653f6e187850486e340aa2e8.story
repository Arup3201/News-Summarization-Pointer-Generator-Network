As recently as March Fabian Delph addressed his England chances as a welterweight might think about beating a fighter of heavyweight class; hopeful, but not investing too much faith. 

The Aston Villa midfielder, a big boxing fan, had just scored a delightful back-heeled winner against Chelsea but in typically humble, matter-of-fact manner rowed back from suggestions that Roy Hodgson could come calling.

‘It’s every players’ ambition to represent their country,’ said Delph back then. ‘But I think I might be a bit away from that. There seems to be a lot of quality midfield players who are English who are above me at the minute. I’ll keep grafting and maybe one day.’

That day has arrived quicker than he anticipated. After a promising cameo to win his first cap against Norway at Wembley, Delph is set to start in Switzerland as England begin their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

The retirements of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard edged the door open, while Jordan Henderson’s injury has widened it further. Delph, who may still play even if the Liverpool man recovers in time, is ready to stride through.

It may seem like a remarkably quick rise to an important role but the Bradford-born midfielder, 24, has been earmarked for international honours ever since his days as a teenage starter at Leeds.

It was there he would kick Gus Poyet during early training sessions – ‘He’d go crazy, speaking in Spanish to me. I learnt a few words I can’t use’ – and there he scored an outrageous goal from near the half-way line against Stockport County in December 2008.

Arsene Wenger came close to signing Delph but ultimately it was Martin O’Neill who paid an initial £6million to take him to Villa in 2009. Just eight months later he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and was out for nearly a year.

During that time he constantly questioned those treating him to the point where he is now called Doctor Delph by team-mates. ‘I like to know what’s wrong with me. I don’t just want to sit on the couch like a potato,’ he says.

Delph’s game was put back though and little more than 18 months ago Villa fans wondered about his impact on the team. Sometimes there were jeers. 

But his resilience and talent saw him emerge and once fully fit he became the engine of Paul Lambert’s midfield, winning the club’s player of the year award last season.

A thunderous goal at Southampton was the highlight, yet it was his energy, work-rate, and positive passing that helped Villa arrest a slide that at one stage looked like it might end in relegation. This summer he took only one week off before employing a personal trainer to increase his strength.

‘The start of my career was dreadful,’ Delph admits. ‘Probably the worst injury you can get in football is your anterior cruciate ligament, I also did my lateral meniscus, and my medial as well. It’s been a tough road.’

There were long journeys in childhood too. Delph grew up in a council estate with little money and would travel a six-hour round trip to training at Leeds. Single mum Donna raised him and remains his inspiration.

‘We never had a car so we would get three buses and a train,’ he says. ‘My mum’s a massive influence, a great lady, a hard woman. She wouldn’t let me come with any excuses.’

Such an upbringing has formed Delph’s character both on and off the pitch. In interviews he answers straight and thoughtfully and often with northern humour.

In midfield he is robust, but refined. The late tackles have become less frequent but there is an edge to his style.

Philippe Senderos may provide Swiss opposition and is aware of Delph’s ability. 'He will bring his energy, his power, his will to move forward all the time,’ says the Villa defender.

For the past months Delph has been getting acquainted with fatherhood alongside partner Natalie as they raise baby girl Sofia. Such maturity is bound to have an impact on his profession.

He adds: ‘You never forget where you come from. I wouldn’t change anything from when I was a young lad. You learn a few things when you’re that age; to strive for better.’
