A man made a macabre discovery when he unearthed a preserved brain in the bush of north Sydney.

Scavenging enthusiast David, who did not give his surname, told The Mosman Daily he was scouring the bushlands in Mosman, on Sydney's north shore, with a metal detector when he came across the brain last Wednesday.

The jar was sent to Royal North Shore Hospital then Glebe morgue for analysis, but authorities still cannot determine the origin of the brain.

'Someone might have nicked it from a school lab or it could have been there for witchcraft. We do find weird things but this is one of the different ones,' David said.

The brain, which was about the size of a large orange, was preserved in a jar labelled formaldehyde.

David, who is from Avalon on Sydney's northern beaches,  came across the jar at 4.30pm near Parriwi Road in Mosman.

Police said it is likely to be an animal's brain, and it will be sent to be sent to a vet hospital for further testing. They have classified it as non suspicious.

David, who regularly searches the Mosman area, said he usually discovers historic coins, musket balls and old buttons, but he has even discovered human bones.

'I actually found a body a couple of years ago,' he said. 'It's an exciting hobby I tell you.' 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Royal North Shore Hospital, but they were unavailable for comment at the time of publication.

A spokesperson for NSW Health Pathology said: 'After visual identification by a neuro pathologist of the brain found in a jar in Mosman bushland it was confirmed as non-human. It has been referred to an animal pathologist.'
