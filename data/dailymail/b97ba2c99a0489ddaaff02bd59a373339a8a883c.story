The suffocation death of an 8-year-old boy whose body was found inside an abandoned refrigerator in central Illinois has been ruled a homicide.

A Peoria County coroner's jury spent more than 30 minutes deliberating Thursday before handing down a ruling in the August 15 death of Marquail Johnson.

The boy's naked body was found in a refrigerator in a yard near his Peoria home, hours after he was reported missing. Peoria is 130 miles southwest of Chicago.

Ruling: The death of Marquail Johnson, 8, has been ruled a homicide three months after his body was discovered inside a discarded refrigerator

Disappearance: The child went missing on the evening of August 14 while playing hide and seek with friends in his Peoria, Illinois, neighborhood

Shocking find: Marquail's naked body turned up inside this old-model refrigerator that was dumped behind his aunt's home

Detective Amanda Chalus said investigators still aren't sure how Johnson wound up in the appliance, which latched from the outside. They also don't know how long he was inside.

His clothes were also discovered inside the refrigerator.

Marquail was last seen alive by his 
mother, Shinta Johnson, at around 8pm on August 14 while playing hide 
and seek with other children at a vacant lot at 810 South Western Avenue, Peoria Journal Star reported.

Mystery: The coroner found no signs of physical or sexual trauma to Marquail's body

The 8-year-old was reported missing 
about two hours later, setting off a massive search that ended the next 
morning when the boy was discovered dead.

Inconsistencies: Shinta Johnson told police her son suffered from autism, but they found no evidence confirming the diagnosis. She also claimed that she went to work the day Marquail vanished, but it turned out to be not true

Marquail's naked body was found stuffed inside an old-model refrigerator that was dumped behind his aunt's home.

An autopsy showed that the child died of suffocation. The coroner found no signs of physical or sexual trauma to his body. 

Investigators determined that the victim and his friends did not play in his aunt’s backyard, which was surrounded by a chain-link fence.

Shinta Johnson told police that her son was autistic, but Detective Chalus said that police found no prescriptions for autism medications or other evidence to confirm the diagnosis.

The investigator also testified that while the boy's mother told police that she was at work on the day her son disappearance, it was later established that she was not at her place of employment.
