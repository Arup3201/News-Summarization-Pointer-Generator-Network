He has studied the dictionary for up to ten hours a day to amass a vocabulary that would put the rest of us to shame.

But teacher Paul Allan clinched the 42nd National Scrabble Championship yesterday using two  words that would not be out of place in his classroom.

Mr Allan scored 46 points for 'ugh' and 'yeah' during a tense final against full-time Scrabble consultant Allan Simmons.

The 43-year-old said his main concern during the match is strategy, not using impressive words.

However, the finished board also included much more obscure words such as 'coniines' and 'bandura', a Ukrainian lute, which earned Mr Allan a score of 86 points - and the £2,500 prize.

He was quoted by The Daily Telegraph as saying: 'The whole dictionary is there, and it is a rich dictionary.

'There are no good or bad words.'

The final came down to the last match in the gruelling best-of-five showdown, but Mr Allan finished with a flurry and an overall score of 503 points to Mr Simmons’ 389. 

Afterwards, Mr Allan said: ‘I am 
delighted to have won, especially given the fact that the final is 
played to a public audience of players who expect to be impressed. Allan
played exceptionally well and was a delight to compete with.’ 

And it is not the first time Mr Allan, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, has savoured victory in the event.

He was previously crowned champion in 2007 and has won a number of tournaments since starting to play Scrabble on a competitive level in 1993.

How
the final board looked: Coniines, a poisonous alkaloid found in 
hemlock, and Atigi, a coat worn by Canadian Inuits, were among the words
used in the Scrabble final

Dedication: Mr Allan, pictured right, spends up to 10 hours a day studying the dictionary

Armed with a four-inch thick tome entitled The Collins Official Scrabble Dictionary, Mr Allan spends up to ten hours a day memorising words. 

The process started several years ago with the three- and four-letter words. Then came the five- and six- letter ones – and so on up to eight.

‘After that, it’s the law of diminishing returns,’ he explained. ‘You end up learning words which you will never ever have the chance to play.

Asked if he ever bothers to learn what they all mean, Mr Allan replied: ‘Mostly – it helps me remember them.’ 

High scores: Mr Allan beat Mr Simmons' 389 final score with an overall score of 503 after playing his last word bandura for 86 points

Oops: Mr Simmons slaps his head as his opponent puts down his last word to win the final

And how often does the champion play? About 30,000 games in the past 20 years – an average of four games a day, 365 days a year.

Away from the game, he enjoys athletics and juggling, although he will be brushing up on his words again in time for next month’s World championships in Prague.

More than 150million Scrabble sets have been sold, according to Mattel, which owns the rights in most countries.

It is estimated that some 30,000 games are started across in the world each hour.
