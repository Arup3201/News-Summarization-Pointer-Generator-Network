A film dramatizing the death of Osama bin Laden is set to debut next month two days before the U.S. presidential election. 

The movie produced by the production company of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein will air on November 4 before President Barack Obama faces Republican challenger Mitt Romney at the polls just two days later.

Weinstein is a prominent fundraiser for Obama’s re-election campaign, which has touted bin Laden’s death as an example of the president’s leadership.

The timing of the film's broadcast prompted suggestions that it was deliberately intended to show the president in a good light two days before the polls.

Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama bin Laden from The Weinstein Co. and Voltage Pictures will air on the National Geographic Channel.

National Geographic Channel chose the film's debut date to help promote the start of its fall season, channel President Howard T. Owens said yesterday. 

He insisted the timing was not motivated by politics, adding: ‘Harvey obviously doesn't schedule our network.

Mr Owens added that the channel is ‘not political. We are opportunistic from a programming perspective.’

National Geographic Channel also took into account Weinstein's desire to get out ahead of a movie about the U.S. Navy SEALs' hunt for the al-Qaida leader to be released in theatres at the end of the year, Mr Owens said.

The competition comes from film 'Zero Dark Thirty' from director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who won six Oscars for the acclaimed 'The Hurt Locker' which follows a team of army bomb disposal experts in Iraq as they battle to carry out their jobs in extremely testing circumstances.

'Seal Team Six,' directed by John 
Stockwell (Into the Blue), was also intended for a big-screen release 
until the channel made what it called a ‘pre-emptive bid’ for it. The 
film will be available to Netflix U.S. subscribers a day after its 
premiere. 

The depiction of
 the bin Laden raid in Pakistan was vetted by experts that included a 
recently retired Navy SEAL and a bin Laden historian, the channel said. 

A
 news release from the channel said: ‘While some aspects of the 
characterizations have been dramatized for creative reasons, the core 
story is an accurate portrayal of an event that ended the longest 
manhunt in American history.’
