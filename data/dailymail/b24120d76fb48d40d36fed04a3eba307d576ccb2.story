Carle Neale, 23, was jailed for six years for punching a drug dealer who was attacking a woman on the street

A father who punched a drug dealer after seeing him attack a vulnerable woman in the street has been jailed - but the pusher won't be prosecuted because he was so badly hurt.

Father-of-one Carl Neale, 23, floored the dealer with a single punch after shouting at him to stop hitting the terrified woman.

A court heard the argument had erupted after the dealer, who has not been named, demanded the woman repay a £40 debt.

After punching the man on Clarence Street, Nuneaton, Warwickshire on August 14 last year, Neale hit him again as he lay on the floor. He then walked away.

Neale, also from Nuneaton, was jailed for six years on Friday after Coventry Crown Court heard the drug dealer had been left fighting for his life.

Doctors were forced to remove a portion of the man’s skull to allow his brain to balloon in size.

Afterwards he was put into an induced coma while surgeons treated injuries to his face and head. He has since been released from hospital.

The court heard because his injuries were so horrific, the drug dealer was not prosecuted over the attack on the woman.

Judge Gregory told Neale he had put the court in 'an impossible position'.

He said: 'You are a young man with a wife and a child and you have a decent future ahead of you if you are prepared to allow yourself that future.

'If you carry on behaving the way you have over the last few years you will be spending the majority of that future behind bars.

'You are very very fortunate you do not face a murder charge.

'You are also an intelligent articulate man capable of doing hard work - but have a grossly irresponsible streak.'

Prosecutor Shane Crawford told the court the victim will suffer fatigue, memory loss and anxiety attacks as a result of his brain damage.

He added: 'The woman was being pursued by the complainant into Clarence Street, she tried to escape from him but was punched by him in this road.

'At this point residents of Clarence Street came out to see what was happening. This defendant was heard to say "you shouldn’t do that".

'His victim released the woman who he was holding over the bonnet of a car and walked towards the defendant who told him to let her go.

Coventry Crown Court, pictured, heard the dealer will not be charged for attacking the woman as his injuries were so severe. Judge Gregory told Neale he was 'fortunate not to face a murder charge'

'The defendant punched the complainant to the face which felled him instantly.'

John Brotherton, defending, told the court Neale was 'not a violent man”.

He said: 'He went to the assistance of a lady who was being attacked by a drug dealer. He is not a violent man, it was two punches.

'Among his references is a letter from the former mayor of Nuneaton and Bedworth who speaks very highly of him.'

Neale admitted one count of causing grievous bodily harm, as well as charges of dangerous driving, assault with intent to resist arrest, attempted burglary, aggravated vehicle taking and two counts of driving whilst disqualified.
