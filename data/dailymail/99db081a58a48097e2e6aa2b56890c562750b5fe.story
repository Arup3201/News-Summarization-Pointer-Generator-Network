A Southern California jury has convicted a woman who was accused of 
drugging her estranged husband before severing his penis and tossing it 
in the garbage disposal.

Jurors found Catherine Kieu guilty Monday of charges of torture and aggravated mayhem for the July 11, 2011, attack.

Sentencing was scheduled for June 28.

Catherine Kieu,was found guilty of charges of torture and aggravated mayhem for the July 11, 2011, attack

During trial, the 60-year-old victim testified that his penis could 
not be reattached and that he felt as though he had been murdered.

Deputy District Attorney John Christl told jurors that Kieu, 50, 
drugged the man's tofu with sleeping pills and screamed 'You deserve 
it!' before attacking him with a 10-inch kitchen knife.

Kieu was jealous and angry about her husband's plans to divorce her 
because he was seeing his ex-girlfriend, the prosecution said.

Audio of the incident was captured by a voice-activated recorder Kieu had hidden in the bedroom, Christl said.

The man, who is not being named by the AP because of the nature of 
the attack, married Kieu after they met at a gym but soon subjected Kieu
 to verbal and sexual abuse, Kieu's public defender, Frank Bittar, said 
during trial.

Kieu had mental health problems caused by a childhood full of 
molestation and other trauma in war-torn Vietnam and her husband also 
constantly demanded sex in ways that caused her pain, Bittar said.

Kieu's husband said it felt as if he'd been 'murdered'

The defense argued she 'had a break from reality' on the night of the attack.

Catherine Kieu, 50, is accused of 
severing her husband's penis because she was angry that he had started 
seeing a former lover and wanted a divorce.

Kieu's public defender, Frank Bittar, said before jury deliberations: 'She's a shattered woman who tried to do the best she could'.

The husband said he remembered waking up tied to the bed.

During the trial Mr Christl described the scene: 'When he woke, she told him "You deserve it" three 
times, and then slices off his penis with one motion of the knife'.

'She then walks into the kitchen, takes the
 severed penis, and puts it into the garbage disposal.'Â

He told the 
court that after she put the penis in the garbage disposal, she then 
turned it on, before calling 911.

'All of a sudden I felt a very sharp pain,' the husband said. 'I will never have a sex life again.'

Bittar agreed that Kieu had a difficult past, but said no one could condone what the victim went through.

'They say anger is the wind that blows out the candle of the mind,' Orange County Deputy District Attorney John Christl said

The
 60-year-old victim, who was not able to have the penis reattached, 
graphically described the attack during the trial and testified he felt 
as though he had been murdered.
