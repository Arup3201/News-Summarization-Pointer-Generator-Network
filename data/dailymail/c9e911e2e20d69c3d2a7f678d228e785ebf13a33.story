Paula Faris is replacing the departing Bianna Golodryga as the news anchor on the weekend edition of Good Morning America - and you might not have even noticed unless someone told you because the two women look nearly identical.

ABC News said Monday that Faris will start Aug. 8.

The World News Now anchor joined the network in 2012 from the NBC affiliate in Chicago, and was recently given exposure as ABC News' reporter at the World Cup.

Faris will be co-anchor of the weekend morning broadcast with Dan Harris. Rob Marciano will also soon be joining the weekend crew as the weather forecaster.

'After 7 years with ABC News, Bianna Golodryga is departing for an 
amazing new opportunity at Yahoo! as news and finance anchor,' ABC News President James Goldston said in a statement obtained by the Cincinnati Enquirer.
