They claim their disaster proof houses can protect against bio-chemical attacks, pandemics and appropriately, natural disasters.

So perhaps that's why a video featuring U.S. firm Strategic Armored and Fortified Environments (Safe) has emerged just days after lethal Superstorm Sandy battered the East Coast, leaving millions of residents and businesses without power.

Company founder and president Al Corbi and his wife Lana, showed the Wall Street Journal around their own fortified home in Washington, DC.

Getaway: The home in Washington, DC, features a helipad for a quick getaway in the event of an earthquake or widespread flooding

It may appear like an ordinary family house with lavish furnishings, but its doors are fitted with ballistic vaults - the same kind found in bank vaults - and facial recognition software.

Meanwhile the roof features a helipad for a quick getaway should disaster strike.

Mrs Corbi told the WSJ: 'We're in a high fire area and an earthquake area. If we ever needed to be airlifted out because the road was impassable, we could be airlifted to safety.'

Deterrent: Mr Corbi can also deploy a range of blinding fogs that go from 'benign to you shouldn't have come here' from the panic room

The family home also features an underground bunker to protect against nuclear or chemical attacks. It is stocked with enough food, water and medical supplies for a family to survive from three to six months.

The Corbis also have a panic room which features a CCTV system connected to the police. They can communicate with any would-be intruders - or looters - via a telephone system that broadcasts throughout the house.

If all else fails they can also deploy a range of blinding fogs. The fogs go in strength from 'benign to you shouldn't have come here,' according to Mr Corbi.

The company kitted out Oprah Winfrey's home for just $1,300, but Mr Corbi told MailOnline that some of his current clients are spending in excess of $10million on their home security.

Mr Corbi described his clientele as not 'wide-eyed 
paranoids,' but 'extremely successful business people. When they 
come to be protected they come with very specific needs.'

Unsurprisingly Safe also kit out superyachts with a fortified hull and even underwater lighting to detect 'rogue divers'.
