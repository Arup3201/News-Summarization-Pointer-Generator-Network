Billy Joe Saunders interrupted Chris Eubank Jnr's press conference  from his Spanish training camp in Marbella by appearing on Skype to send a warning to his British rival.

Eubank Jnr revealed he had finally signed a deal to fight Saunders on November 29 at the ExCeL in front of 20,000 spectators.

However Saunders, who has put his European, Commonwealth and British titles on the line, seemed to be irate at both Eubank Jnr and his father despite the two camps finally coming to an agreement with the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) over the upcoming fight.

Chris Eubank, who was sat alongside his son, called Saunders' antics 'ridiculous'.

The former boxer said: 'The best man is going to win the fight.

'We are not running away from Saunders, we are running to him. We are doing everything by the book.'

Saunders, who held up a skeleton during the Skype call to represent what he is going to do to his middleweight rival, said to Eubank Jnr via Skype: 'You have no balls. Don't go around scared like a little pussy that you are.

'You are a little boy. I will give you £20,000 to not fight in Liverpool.'

Eubank Jnr, who will fight Jez Wilson at Liverpool's Echo Arena on October 25 before facing Saunders, said: 'It is my time now.

'Everything is done when we want it to be done. I don't need to go overseas to do any kind of training camps. I can stay in Brighton and take this guy out comfortably.'

Eubank Jnr believes he will 'comfortably' defeat British rivals Saunders in November

Boxing promoter Frank Warren clashed with Eubank over the terms of the deal surrounding the fight

Frank Warren, who exchanged fierce words with  Eubank, said it will be a 'great fight between two undefeated fighters'.

'This has dragged on,' said Warren. 'It was a headache. But we are doing this fight for the fans. I have had to pay step-a-side money to get this fight over the line.'

Dereck Chisora will face Tyson Fury on the same night as Saunders' bout with Eubanks Jnr.
