Michael Bisping kept his hopes of a title shot alive with a stoppage victory over Cung Le in Macau.

The British middleweight was looking for his first win in almost 18 months after suffering a tame defeat by Tim Kennedy in April.

Bisping slowly but surely wore Le down before the fight was stopped in the fourth round.

After a competitive opening session, Bisping landed a jab which cut Le near his left eye.

Fight: A cut to Cung Le's left eye meant the fight was stopped in the fourth round in Macau

The 42-year-old complained he had been poked in the eye but replays showed otherwise.

The doctor allowed the fight to continue and Bisping edged the third round to carve out a lead before finishing the job in the next session.

A barrage of blows left Le badly beaten and the referee stepped in to stop the contest.

Bisping then called out Luke Rockhold as he bids to work his way towards the title shot that has so far eluded him.

He said: ‘There’s an idiot called Luke Rockhold who doesn’t stop talking about me. I think he’s got the hots for me, to be honest.

‘I’m going to beat him then take the title, make no mistake!’

Claims: The 42-year-old said he had been poked in the eye but video replays suggested otherwise
