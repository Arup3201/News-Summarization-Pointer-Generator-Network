John Whittingdale said Lord Justice Leveson would send ¿a very dangerous message¿ if his inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation

State regulation of newspapers would set ‘an extraordinarily dangerous precedent’ that would send a message ‘around the world’ that Press freedom wasn’t worth fighting for, a senior MP warned last night.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the influential Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said Lord Justice Leveson would send ‘a very dangerous message’ if his inquiry into press standards calls for statutory regulation.

In one of the most hard-hitting warnings regarding the Leveson Inquiry to date, Mr Whittingdale said a demand for new laws could encourage autocrats to erode hard-won freedoms around the world.

He told a Society of Editors conference in Belfast that newspapers’ efforts to draw up a more robust self-regulatory system, under the stewardship of Press Complaints Commission chairman Lord Hunt, should be given a chance to work.

That would see papers sign binding contracts to adhere to a much tougher regime to settle complaints, with large fines for those who break the rules.

Crucially, it would avoid passing laws to underpin a new regulator that would ultimately give politicians a way of meddling with Press freedom.

The Conservative MP warned that the introduction of state regulation in the UK could start a domino effect in other nations.

‘I think there is a real danger of that,’ he said. ‘It would set an extraordinarily dangerous precedent. It sends a very dangerous message elsewhere.

‘There is no question that this country is seen as a real beacon of freedom, something that we should be immensely proud of.

‘For the UK to set a precedent in establishing a government body with some involvement and influence over the Press I feel would give a green light to all those other countries which would say,

“Well if the UK can do it, the place where parliamentary democracy was formed, the place where the Magna Carta was written, then clearly it is OK and we can do the same”.’

He added: ‘This is being watched around the world and may well be followed if we go down that road.’

Barrister David Price, QC, an expert in media law, told the conference that David Cameron’s appointment of Lord Justice Leveson to head the inquiry into press standards was a mistake.

He said he was surprised the judge was given the job since he is a criminal lawyer, rather than an expert in libel, defamation and privacy law.

‘He is a criminal lawyer – all his instincts will be to regulate, to look back at something that has gone wrong,’ he said. Lord Black, executive director of the Telegraph Group who has drawn up the alternative to statutory regulation, told the conference Lord Justice Leveson should give editors six months to prove the beefed-up watchdog would ‘be the scourge of bad journalism’.

Jonathan Grun, editor of the Press Association and the new president of the Society of Editors, said even the ‘dab’ of statute that campaigners are demanding would affect freedom of expression.

‘That dab would be only the start – in time the screws would be turned,’ he said.

‘That would eventually remove a precious freedom that we should cherish. The liberty of the Press is the birthright of a Briton.

Not the birthright of newspaper owners, or editors, or journalists – it is the birthright of every citizen. If that is extinguished it may be that some small sections of society will celebrate but over time the vast majority of the public will be the losers.’

Lord Justice Leveson is expected to report back later this month or early in December.

Other members of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned it would be ‘bonkers’ to impose statutory regulation on the Press while leaving the internet and Twitter users unrestrained. Tory MP Angie Bray said: ‘If there is no way of bringing Twitter and the like into line it makes it absolutely ridiculous to start talking about statutory regulation of the newspaper industry.’
