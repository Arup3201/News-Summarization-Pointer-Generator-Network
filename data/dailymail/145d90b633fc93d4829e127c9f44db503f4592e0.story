An Ohio morgue employee revealed he may have had sex with 'a hundred' corpses and continued to do so even after his wife had tipped off authorities.

Speaking about the incidents in deposition audio obtained by WCPO, Hamilton County employee Kenneth Douglas said 'I would get on top of them and pull my pants down.'

When talking about the body of victim Charlene Appling, Douglas said 'I do remember going in the freezer, pulling her in one of the rooms in the back' before he told an investigator he 'had sex with her.'

When asked about the number of corpses he had sex with, Douglas answered 'It could have been a hundred' in the deposition audio.

Douglas attributed his behavior to drug and alcohol abuse in the deposition.

'If I wasn't drinking, or hadn't had anything to drink when I went to work, it wouldn't happen. I would do crack and go in and I would drink and go in,' he said.

His wife was featured in a deposition video obtained by WCPO, in which she said she tried to contact someone about her husband's behavior - but she was dismissed.

'Marty said "Pat, whatever happens on county property on county time is county business,"' she said in the video.

Wife: Douglas' wife said in a deposition that when he comes home he 'reeks of [expletive]'

At the time, she also said her husband 'gets undressed and he reeks of [expletive].'

WCPO said Douglas admitted to having sex with the bodies of April Hicks, Karen Range and Charlene Appling. Both Appling and Range were murder victims.

'[In 2008] DNA connected him to semen found in Range,' the affiliate station said. '[...] In 2008, Douglas pleaded guilty in the Range case and was sentenced to three years in prison. In 2012, he pleaded guilty again in the Appling and Hicks cases. Their families sued that year.'

WCPO reported that an appeals court upheld the lawsuit last week.

'Hamilton County, like any other employer is not and should not be responsible for the criminal acts of an employee,' Greg Hartmann, President of the Hamilton County Commission, said in a statement to the system. 'The taxpayers should not have to pay money for the acts committed by criminals.'
