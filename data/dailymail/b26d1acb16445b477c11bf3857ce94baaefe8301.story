A funeral has been held for the newborn found dead at a Michigan recycling center after his mother allegedly left him freeze to death.  

Dozens attended the service for the boy, known simply as Baby Henry, whose body was discovered almost two months ago at a recycling center in the city of Roseville, near Detroit. 

Morgue employees named the child 'Henry Alexander Macomb,' after the county's namesake, Gen. Alexander Macomb.  

The newborn's lifeless body was discovered in January at the recycling facility - his mother Angela Alexie, is charged with felony murder and first-degree child abuse.

The 24-year-old relinquished her rights to bury the baby.

 'I don't know what to say. I'm standing here representing the church, and I'm just as confused as most of you,' said Richard Shubik, a deacon at St. Paul on the Lake Catholic Church in Grosse Pointe Farms who presided over the service. 

'But I think it's fitting, and I'm proud of all of you that are here today so that we can send Baby Henry off to the kingdom in the proper way.'

Shubik, along with a number of those in attendance at Resurrection Cemetery in Macomb County's Clinton Township, became emotional during the brief service, pausing in the middle of a prayer to compose himself.

The service also featured a bagpiper in addition to the procession led by the honor guard.

Clinton Township fire Lt. Paul Brouwer, who walked behind the baby's casket, said he and his fellow firefighters were moved by the baby's story.

The burial plot in an area of the cemetery devoted to children, as well as the casket and a viewing held Tuesday evening all were donated.

'He was here for just such a short time that it was a tragedy to say the least. Hopefully with this his spirit can rest easy,' Brouwer said.

Clinton Township Supervisor Robert Cannon, who helped organize the effort, said 'we adopted the baby as a community.'

'He started out without anybody loving him. Now, we all love him. And I want the world forever to know that,' Cannon said.

Alexie,  gave birth to the baby  alone in a garage in Eastpointe, Michigan, on December 22, 2014, and cut the umbilical cord with her teeth.

The mother-of-three, whose children are all in foster care, claims she didn't have the strength to take the baby to authorities as she was embarrassed and didn't know if her boyfriend was the father.   

Wrapping the child in a blanket, Alexie left the him on the floor of the open-windowed residential garage for two days as she slept inside, checking on him every two hours. 

She attempted to breastfeed him, she says, but he never latched on. She did not bring him formula.

Angela Alexie, 24, (pictured in February  allegedly delivered the baby boy on her own in the unattached garage of a friend's house that she was residing in and then put the baby in a recycling bin after he had died

On Christmas Eve, John died, and Alexie posted on Facebook 'RIP Baby', which she claims referred to somebody else's child. 

Alexie placed the body in a plastic bag and left him on the floor of the garage for another week before somebody placed the bag in a recycling dumpster, the court heard in February.  

The court also heard from Cyndee Johnson, a worker at ReCommunity Recycling who saw John's body come down the conveyor belt on January 14. 

He was blue, covered in snow, and curled up as if he were trying to stay warm, Johnson said. 

'When I first saw, it scared me,' Johnson said tearfully. 'I jumped back. I moved back. I realized this was an actual baby.'

It is believed that the child was born on or around December 22 in the garage of a friend's house in Eastpointe (pictured) and died Christmas Eve night, but the Macomb County Medical Examiner's Office is still working to confirm the timeline

'It just grabbed my heart. I knew something wasn't right.' 

'I said, 'That's a real baby. Stop the line! Stop the line!'' she testified. 

There is no official cause of death but authorities believe hypothermia played a major role. 

'She did nothing. She let that child freeze to death,' Macomb County Assistant Prosecutor Bill Cataldo said, according to Detroit Free Press. 

'He died when there were a number of ways to save him.'

Alexie said she concealed the pregnancy from her boyfriend and pretended to have miscarried.

Authorities released an appeal to find the mother, which prompted a response from Amy Lesniak, who is caring for two of Alexie's children.

She said she suspected Alexie was pregnant when she started missing visits, claiming to have the flu or stomach problems.

When she heard a baby was found in the dumpster, she called police saying she believed the child was Alexie's.  

Steven Kaplan, Alexie's attorney, said she has a 'severe lack of parenting skills, limited intelligence and lack of family support' in court yesterday.

Kaplan will not seek a competency exam because it appeared to him that 'she has sufficient cognizance to assist her attorney in the hearing'.

He plans to request a forensic evaluation regarding the issue of criminal responsibility or culpability, which he believes could lead to an insanity defense. 

Alexie relinquished her rights to bury the baby. 

Eastpointe Judge Carl Gerds set bond at $1 million.
