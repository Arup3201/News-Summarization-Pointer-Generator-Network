Intelligence agency GCHQ is able to spy on Facebook and Youtube users and can manipulate online polls, according to the latest documents allegedly leaked by fugitive CIA worker Edward Snowden.

Documents thought to have been provided by the whistleblower allegedly show that the Cheltenham-based agency has developed a set of software programmes designed to breach users' computers and manipulate the internet.

Among the listed tools are ones capable of searching for private Facebook photographs, sending fake text messages, changing the outcome of online polls, censoring 'extremist' material, and collating comments on Youtube and Twitter.

Some of the software enables the psychological manipulation of internet users, not unlike the controversial secret study recently undertaken with the approval of Facebook, in which the social network altered people's newsfeeds to see if it had an effect on their emotions.

The list of programmes was revealed in a Wikipedia-style document allegedly compiled by GCHQ's Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group 
(JTRIG), which was first published by The Intercept.

The tools, which have each been given codenames such as Birdsong, Angry Pirate, and Scrapheap Challenge are described as being part of the agency's 'weaponised capability'.

The list, apparently compiled in 2012,
 also notes whether a tool is operational, or in the design, pilot or 
implementation stages, although the document states that most of them are 'fully 
operational, tested and reliable'.

It states: 'Don't treat this like a 
catalogue. If you don't see it here, it doesn't mean we can't build it.

'If you involve the JTRIG operational teams at the start of your operation, you have more of a chance that we will build something for you.

'For each of our tools we have indicated the state of the tool. We only advertise tools here that are either ready to fire or very close to being ready (operational requirements would re-prioritise our development).'

GCHQ had not responded to a MailOnline request for comment at the time of publication.

Publication of the list comes as Snowden criticised Britain for introducing the new surveillance Bil, which was pushed through Parliament today and designed to foil terrorist plots, during peace time.

Snowden, 31, who has become one of the world’s most wanted men, said the measures to allow the security services and police to monitor the public’s phone, email and internet records ‘defied belief’.

‘We don’t have bombs falling. We don’t have U-boats in the harbour,' he told the Guardian newspaper.

Snowden is wanted for treason after stealing classified documents from the US National Security Agency, and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia.

The defence contractor, a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, has previously leaked highly damaging revelations of attempts by state spy agencies – including Britain’s GCHQ and MI5 – to monitor citizens’ private information.

After he revealed how intelligence agents had access to data compiled by the likes of Google and Yahoo, some of the internet giants – under pressure from civil liberties groups – became reluctant to co-operate with the Government and say they may withhold crucial intelligence.

David Cameron insisted last week that new snooping laws were urgently needed because Snowden had compromised the ability of the spy agencies to keep track of dangerous extremists.

Earlier this week Government lawyers admitted that GCHQ, MI5 and MI6
 do intercept private communications such as phone calls and emails by 
innocent people in order to target terrorist suspects.

However, 
lawyers representing intelligence chiefs said the mass surveillance was 
‘lawful and appropriate’ and said claims it acted illegally were 
‘outlandish’.

The defence was included in legal documents submitted 
in a landmark challenge over the activities of the spy agencies at the 
Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT).

The case, which is ongoing, has 
been brought following the leak of documents by Snowden linked to the 
alleged surveillance practices of GCHQ and the US National Security 
Agency (NSA).

Privacy campaigners claim that safeguards surrounding GCHQ’s collection of vast quantities of online data are inadequate and do not conform to the law.
