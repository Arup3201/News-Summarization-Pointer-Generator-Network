From Jack the Ripper to modern day murder mysteries, the nation is gripped by the ins and outs of major crime cases.

But, with the gritty details of forensic examinations and police investigations often remaining out of the public eye, it's usually left to TV dramas such as CSI, Law and Order and Silent Witness to fill us in on what really happens behind closed doors.

However, soon we will be able to get close to the experts who started it all, because a new exhibition featuring historic figures from the world of forensic medicine is set to launch - and it will feature never-before-seen case notes of autopsies as well as prototypical mug shots from the 19th Century.

Never-seen-before handwritten autopsy index cards by notorious forensic pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury  will form part of the hotly-anticipated 'Forensics: the anatomy of crime' exhibition, which will run for four months at London's Wellcome Collection museum in 2015

The exhibition, which examines the history, science and art of forensic medicine, will run from February until June and will feature an array of ancient artefacts and artwork including the first prototypes of mug shots, dating back to the 19th Century, by Alphonse Bertillon

Several artworks will also be on display, including this 18th Century watercolour showing the decomposition of a Japanese noble lady

The exhibition, called 'Forensics: the anatomy of crime', will even include a literal murder scene - the floor tiles on which a friend of Mexican artist Teresa Margolles was killed.

Set to launch at London's Wellcome Collection museum next February, the exhibition examines the history, science and art of forensic medicine and will bring together all manner of macabre treasures, including artworks and artefacts dating back as far as the Middle Ages.

Among the displays are intricate 18th century Japanese watercolours capturing the decay of a dead noblewoman, and prototypical mug shots from forensic pioneer Alphonse Bertillon alongside their 1970s identikit progeny. 

However, the most anticipated exhibits are likely to be a selection of never-before-seen case notes handwritten by notorious forensic pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury.

The yellowing index cards document some of the 20,000 autopsies Sir Spilsbury performed during his career, which spanned some of the most gripping whodunnits of the early 20th century.

His profile was such that the satirical journal Punch featured his portrait in a 1928 issue, on display in the exhibition, declaring: 'When arsenic has closed your eyes, this certain hope your corpse may rest in: Sir B will kindly analyse the contents of your large intestine.'

Lucy Shanahan, curator of the Wellcome Collection exhibition said: 'I get the impression that perhaps it became a default to go to Spilsbury rather than anyone else.

'Whilst Spilsbury's reputation did become damaged towards the end of his career, I don't think that necessarily means that he got everything wrong.

'I think he probably just got a little bit too caught up in his own ego and then perhaps wasn't doing as much of a thorough job as he should have been.

'Judging by his workload, he probably had far too many cases.'

Many suspect that Sir Spilsbury made serious blunders during his career, including in what was arguably his best known case - the trial of Dr Hawley Crippen.

The American-born doctor was convicted at the Old Bailey in 1910 of poisoning his wife Cora following her disappearance, and sentence to be hanged.

Investigators discovered human flesh in his cellar that Sir Spilsbury testified must have come from the missing Mrs Crippen, all but delivering Crippen to the gallows.

But nearly 100 years later, U.S. scientists called the pathologist's findings into question, with DNA testing revealing the flesh had more than likely belonged to a man.

Whether or not the gruesome find in Crippen's home did indeed belong to his late wife, Ms Shanahan - who has spent nearly three years poring over the documents in the forensics exhibition - does not believe an innocent man was hanged.

'(Crippen) was definitely up to no good,' she said.

'He had a mistress, he had a reason to leave the country, so it must have been fairly serious.

'There are a lot of question marks that are left hanging, but I'm sure he wasn't squeaky clean.'

Though Sir Spilsbury's notes on the Crippen case are not among the thousands owned by the Wellcome Collection, the forthcoming exhibition will feature press clippings and courtroom portraits from the trial.

The public will also get a rare glimpse at lesser-known cases pursued by Sir Spilsbury, including that of young Helen Elphinston-Dalrymple, who died when she had dry shampoo applied at the Harrods hair salon in 1909.

Ms Shanahan said there may well be whispers, hidden in the trove of terse post-mortem examination notes, of innocent men sent to their deaths thanks to Sir Spilsbury's testimony.

'It would be an interesting task for a present-day forensic pathologist to undertake if somebody had an interest in reassessing his work,' she said.

'We worked quite closely with a coroner at the beginning of the exhibition as a consultant, and I took him to see the Spilsbury cards.

'He was absolutely bowled over.

A series of 18th Century watercolour  paintings will form part of the 'Forensics: the anatomy of crime' exhibition in London next year

The exhibition at Wellcome Collection – the museum of medical history and oddities in Euston Road, - runs from February 26 to June 21

'He'd read so much about them, heard so much about them in the field, but never actually seen them - so I'm sure there are a lot of people who would love to get their hands on them.'

Ken Arnold, head of public programmes at Wellcome Collection, said the museum was looking forward to welcoming new visitors following its £17.5million expansion.

He said: 'Forensics' reminds us of the human body's extraordinary capacity to leave traces beyond death and disappearance.

'This unsettling truth is the focus of an astonishing range of scientific enquiry and fertile territory for the cultural imagination. 

'Challenging, affecting, at once familiar and disquieting, it's a perfect subject for Wellcome Collection to explore as it welcomes visitors to its new expanded spaces.'
