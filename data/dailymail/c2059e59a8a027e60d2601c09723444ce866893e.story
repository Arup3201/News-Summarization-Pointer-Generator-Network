A Maori Muslim leader who openly supports extremist activity in the Middle East has started his own Islamic State in a New Zealand town.

Te Amorangi Kireka-Whaanga, who is the leader of the Aotearoa Maori Muslim Association, announced via social media on Sunday that he had changed the organisation's name to the Islamic State of Aotearoa. 

Mr Kireka-Whaanga of Hastings, north-east of Wellington, has openly supported the Islamic State militant group in the past on Facebook saying it will cause the end of western civilisation.

Te Amorangi Kireka-Whaanga has started the Islamic State of Aotearoa in Hastings, north-east of Wellington 

He posted on his Facebook page calling on 'Muslim souljahs, warriors and followers of prophet Muhammad' to make their way to Hastings and 'blow everyone away with the beauty and magic of love, truth, wisdom and divine blessings'.

'Out with the old and in with the new, let's radiate the power of truth the magic of it upon the starving souls of mankind.' 

He proclaims he is 'a peace advocate trying to achieve my goal of winning a Nobel peace prize'. 

Mr Kireka-Whaanga was named one of the world's 500 most influential Muslims by a group in Jordan in 2010 and was one of just two New Zealanders to make the list, the New Zealand Herald reports.

The mayor of the Hastings, Lawrence Yule, said the Facebook posts to Mr Kireka-Whaanga's 900-odd friends were 'very concerning' considering the violent nature of the group in the Middle East.

'I don't think any normal, law-abiding Kiwi would think there's any time or place for this kind of behaviour,' he said.

'When you have our own citizens setting up a terrorist-style cult within New Zealand, then the agencies on behalf of New Zealanders will do anything they can to stamp them out. I don't think there's any place in New Zealand for these Islamic cults.'

Last month, Mr Kireka-Whaanga told the Star Times that his family wanted to relocate to Syria but he expected his passport to be cancelled by the New Zealand government.

He said the United Nations didn't care that Muslims were being killed across the world and he understood the actions of the Islamic State.

'If you practise your religion then of course you'll be 100 per cent behind Islamic State,' he said
