Ed Miliband risked an own goal last night over claims that he has used a professional voice coach to boost his flagging ratings.

The Mail on Sunday has been told that the Labour leader has had lessons in how to sound more appealing and inspiring from television continuity announcer Paul Jamieson, who helps bankers and businessmen get their messages across.

The claims come just 24 hours after Mr Miliband said he had no time for ‘politics driven by image,’ declaring: ‘If you want the politician from central casting, it’s just not me, it’s the other guy.’

But while Mr Miliband has publicly derided political photo opportunities, well-placed sources say he has been brushing up his presentational skills with the help of Mr Jamieson, also a respected theatre producer.

Mr Jamieson says he uses ‘the sheer physicality of theatrical expression... to help people communicate in ways that are visual, powerful and inspiring’.

He claims to ‘unblock’ his clients and ‘harness their physical powers to provide inspiring leadership’ – a boast which may expose Mr Miliband to more jokes, bearing in mind jibes about his ‘nasal’ tone. Shortly after becoming Labour leader, he underwent a nose operation to help with his sleep apnoea, though it does not appear to have improved his voice.

Mr Jamieson, whose clients include BP, drugs giant Pfizer, and Deutsche Bank, works for the Corporate Theatre, which helps would-be leaders from all walks of life.

Its website declares Mr Jamieson ‘pre-coaches clients and gives new confidence and freedom’.

It also explains the organisation is made up of ‘performing artists, political scientists, philosophers, historians and organisational psychologists’.

Its aim is to ‘help people lose their ego and find how to create the energy needed to integrate Doing, Thinking and Being.

‘Leaders are accountable for giving away leadership to the best person for the job in hand. Using a model of Presence, Connection, Authenticity and Courage, we take them on a journey that helps them discover how to realise their ambition.’ It says its methods draw on ‘the great tradition of the mediaeval troubadour and renaissance minstrel, the role of the “singer of tales”, the wandering performer who fuses music, storytelling, drama and the power of words to awaken and unite audiences in many lands’.

Successfully used, it can ‘connect clients with the true but hitherto untapped potential within themselves… towards fresh thinking, courageous authenticity, and deeper emotional empathy’.

The website gives examples of questions asked by clients, which sound distinctly like the kind of questions Miliband may have been tempted to ask, such as: ‘I want to believe we are doing the right thing. But I’m not sure – and neither is anyone else... is there a way we can be more sure?’

It continues: ‘Our clients come to us because they want to increase the bandwidth of inspirational engagement. Our learning programmes include coaching, seminars, theatrical scenarios, visual group work and practical training, drawing on performing arts, psychology, politics and ethics.’

Asked what was the weirdest voiceover job he had ever done, Mr Jamieson once said: ‘I was the voice of an air conditioner for an air conditioning company and their in-house video. And I was the voiceover for Miss Great Britain.’

Marc Stears, the Labour leader’s Oxford University friend and speechwriter, also works with the Corporate Theatre.

A spokesman for Mr Miliband said: ‘We don’t comment on internal matters.’ Mr Jamieson could not be reached for comment.
