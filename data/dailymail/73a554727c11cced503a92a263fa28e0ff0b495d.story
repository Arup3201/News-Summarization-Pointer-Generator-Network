The father of a newborn baby who was killed in an apparent dog attack carried her small pink coffin into a church today as mourners gathered to pay their last respects.

Eliza-Mae Mullane was just six days old when Nisha, an Alaskan malamute recently rescued by her parents, allegedly attacked her in her nursery at home in Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire.

Her devastated parents, Sharon John, 42, and Patrick Mullane, 35, were greeted by friends and family outside the Welsh village's Holy Cross Catholic Church, two weeks after the attack happened.

The order of service carried a picture
 of Eliza-Mae still wearing her hospital ID wrist band, and the words 
‘Daddy's pudding’. Her parents both wore pink for the funeral, attended 
by 50 mourners.

People 
carried pink teddies and heart-shaped wreaths into the simple 30-minute 
service. The baby's coffin was covered with pink and white flowers as 
scrap dealer Mr Mullane carried it into the church.

Father
 Pius Augustine said: ‘This is a terribly sad occasion for Eliza-Mae's 
family. The whole community is behind them and they will be in our 
thoughts and prayers.’

Two 
children's songs - The Butterfly Song and Somewhere Over the Rainbow, 
sung by Eva Cassidy - were played. Police who investigated Eliza-Mae's 
death sat with her family and friends.

On the back of the order of service, her parents thanked people for their kindness since the tragedy.

 is a terribly sad occasion for Eliza-Mae's family. The whole community 
is behind them and they will be in our thoughts and prayers'

Father Pius Augustine

And
 in a statement released later, they said: ‘Even though she was an 
important part of our family for such a short period of time, Eliza-Mae 
will always be in our hearts and thought.

‘We will cherish the little time we 
were able to share with her. She was a dearly loved daughter, sister, 
grand-daughter and niece.

‘She brought joy into our family, and losing her like this has cast the most horrible shadow over all of us.’

Died aged six days old: Eliza-Mae spent the first three days of her short life in a special care unit at the maternity hospital where she was born

She had spent just three nights at home when the dogs - Nisha and a collie cross called Roxy - attacked her. After police carried out forensic tests, the dogs were humanely destroyed.

Ms John has two other children - Harley, five, and Lily-Rose, three - in their terraced house.

An inquest is due to be held later this year into Eliza-Mae’s death, which happened on February 18.
