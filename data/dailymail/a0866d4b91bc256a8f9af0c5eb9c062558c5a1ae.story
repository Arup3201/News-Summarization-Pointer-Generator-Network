Hundreds of thousands of mussels have washed ashore on a beach, prompting officials to warn people not to eat them.

A stretch of Robberg Beach, on the southern coast of South Africa, has been transformed into 'mussel beach' as thousands of the black molluscs cover the sands.

As experts try to to work out what caused the mussels to be washed up, people were warned to play it safe and not eat them.

Some fear that a toxic bloom of algae may have contributed to the mussels being washed ashore, but experts have denied this

Some believe that toxic 'red tide', a harmful bloom of algae, may have played a role in the mussels being washed up along the 325-yard section of the beach, but this has been dismissed by experts.

Conservationist Dr Mark Brown, from Nature's Valley Trust, told the Port Elizabeth Herald: 'It does not appear to be linked to red tide or anything sinister at this stage.

'A similar event happened in November last year in the same spot.

'Essentially large swells and currents break beds of mussels off the reef and they wash up.'

Officials believe strong currents may have washed the mussels off a reef further out at sea

While people have been warned not to eat the mussels, flocks of seagulls have been seen enjoying the delicacy

South African National Parks marine ecologist Kyle Smith warned the public to resist eating the delicacy.

'Most of the mussels were still alive when they washed up, which lowers the possibility that it is related to some form of toxin from either a red algal bloom or other source. 

'As a precautionary measure, I would advise the public not to eat them.' 

The expert's warning has not stopped seagulls from taking advantage of the unexpected feast, with flocks of birds seen getting their fill of the mussels.
