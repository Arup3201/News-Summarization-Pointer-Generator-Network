Williams have confirmed Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas as their driver line-up for the 2015 Formula One season.

Massa was already under contract for next term, whilst Williams have taken up the option on Bottas' contract following a stunning campaign.

For Massa, next year will be the Brazilian's 14th season in F1, whilst Finn Bottas is fast emerging as a proven talent following the emergence of Williams as a force to again be reckoned with in F1.

In his first year with Williams, following his release from Ferrari at the end of last season, Massa has been involved in a number of unfortunate incidents that have hindered his results.

But given the 33-year-old's experience, he has endeared himself to the team, scoring Williams' first pole for two years in the Austrian Grand Prix in June.

Bottas, who started out as test driver in 2010 before progressing to the race seat in 2012, has gone from strength to strength, scoring four podiums in the last five races to lie fifth in the drivers' standings.

Team principal Sir Frank Williams said: 'I'm delighted to confirm Felipe and Valtteri will be racing for Williams again in 2015.

'Felipe is a pleasure to work with, and combines raw pace with a wealth of experience.

'As for Valtteri, we have known for many years he is a very special talent, and in the FW36 we have given him a car that is allowing him to demonstrate his skills.

'The team is having a much improved 2014 season, and the skill of our drivers and their feedback to our engineers has proved crucial in this.

'This announcement gives us excellent stability for 2015 but of course we are very much focusing our attention on maximising the full potential of the car in the remaining seven races of this season.'

The confirmation, ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, ends gossip surrounding Bottas as he had started to be linked with rival teams.

In confirming his immediate future with Williams, Bottas said: 'I've been a member of the Williams team for five years now and we have developed together throughout that time which is a great feeling.

'The team has also made some very impressive gains this season and I'm confident I'm at a team that is moving in the right direction and can continue to be competitive.

'Sir Frank and Claire (deputy team principal) have put a lot of faith in me and I'm very grateful they continue to do so.

'Felipe and I have a good working relationship and this early announcement will help us both input into the ongoing development of this year's car and next year's car.'

Massa believes the team, currently pressuring Ferrari for third in the constructors' championship, have built a solid platform this season on which they can build for 2015.

Massa said: 'I'm really enjoying my time at Williams and I feel settled here.

'Williams is such an iconic name in motor racing and I have a lot of pride when racing for this team.

'This season we have started to show our true potential, and I'm driving a car that is looking strong and has improved a lot as the season has progressed which is very encouraging for the future.

'It's important we continue to push in the second half of the season and that we start 2015 with some really good momentum we can build on.'
