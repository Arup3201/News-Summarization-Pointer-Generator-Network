A silent film long thought lost has been found in a disused cinema in Holland.

The 90-minute film, Love, Life And Laughter, was released in June 1923 by director George Pearson and starred Betty Balfour, the biggest British female star of the era who was nicknamed the Queen of Happiness.

It tells the story of a poor writer and an actress and their dreams of becoming rich and successful.

Only one other film by Pearson survives in its entirety – Squibs Wins the Calcutta Sweep – and Love, Life and Laughter was included in the British Film Institute's (BFI) most wanted list of lost films.

The film comes from an era when silent feature films were being made for Britain. The following year, the majority of British studios went bankrupt in the financial crisis and bailiffs were sent in to remove film stock, which was then burned or recycled. It is thought that 80 per cent of British silent films are lost.

It was found in old film cans in a former cinema in the Dutch town of Hattem as the building was being redeveloped. The developer passed the cans on to experts at Eye, the Dutch film museum. He thought that they might contain films from the Second World War. Eye’s curators recognised its importance.

Bryony Dixon, the silent film curator at the BFI archive, said: ‘This is a major discovery featuring Betty Balfour, the biggest female star of the silent period. It is also a rare survival of the work of George Pearson, one of Britain's most talented directors of this time whose First World War drama Reveille is another film on the BFI’s most wanted list.

‘Contemporary reviewers and audiences considered Love, Life And Laughter to be one of the finest creations of British cinema, it will be thrilling to find out if they're right. We hope to be able to acquire some material from our colleagues at EYE soon so that British audiences can have a chance to see this exciting discovery.’

Miss Dixon added that Pearson was one of Britain's most talented silent film directors. ‘He launched Balfour's career and it is this film that really pushed her in to that stellar arena. She was our biggest star of the silent era. She was much loved and had that common touch, she was quite ordinary and she played on it.’

Pearson made many films with Balfour, in part because he had a crush on her – he was devastated when she refused to marry him.

Balfour, who died in 1977, plays a chorus girl called Tip-Toes in the film who dreams of becoming a music hall star.

She made her name playing a comic character called Squibs in a popular series of films, also directed by Pearson, which were huge hits in Holland as well as the UK.

Born at Chester-le-Street, Durham in March 1903, Betty Balfour began acting on the stage when

she was just 10 and even took over from Gertrude Lawrence on stage in The Midnight Follies.

Balfour was the most popular actress in Britain in the 1920s.

She appeared in the popular Squibs comedy series produced by George Pearson who was in love with her although it was not reciprocated.

Their professional partnership ended when she turned down his marriage proposal.

She starred in Alfred Hitchcock’s Champagne (1928) but her talkies debut, The Nipper (1930), based on Squibs, was only moderately successful.

She did not mature into a character actress and her career floundered to the extent that in 1952 she attempted suicide.

She spent the last 25 years of her life living quietly out of the spotlight.

She died at Weybridge, Surrey in November 1977 aged 74.
