Standing with a Manchester United scarf in the middle of the Kop while thousands of Liverpool fans blast out 'You'll Never Walk Alone' might strike most people as a crazy stunt to pull.

So when a picture emerged of one brave soul appearing to do just that during Sunday's top-four clash, many Twitter users got very excited.

The image went viral, with even Wayne Rooney tweeting about it after United's 2-1 win at Anfield.

A Manchester United fan photoshopped into the Kop at Anfield; Rooney even tweeted about him after the game

The original picture of the Manchester United fan was taken on a pre-season tour in Bangkok in 2013

The Liverpool fans shown in the image were actually watching their team against Birmingham in 2011

Rooney wrote: 'Very happy tonight. Fans were amazing. Juan Mata great goals. Should of let him take penalty. And the United fan in the kop. Brilliant' 

Unfortunately, it turns out that the image was a fake, with everyone, including the Manchester United captain, taken in by the clever use of Photoshop.

A few hours later Sportsmail can reveal the original picture of the United fan, taken a long way from the Kop, which was super-imposed into the Anfield crowd.

The actual image was taken in Bangkok in 2013, when United played there on a pre-season tour, and shows a fan at the airport waiting for the United team to arrive.

Meanwhile, the image it was dropped into was not from Anfield on Sunday, but actually from a game against Birmingham in 2011. 

The online pranksters, ynfa, did the job properly though, replacing a Luis Suarez scarf from 2011 with a generic Liverpool one to keep up the illusion.
