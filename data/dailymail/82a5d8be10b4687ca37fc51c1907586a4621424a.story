While many clubs make a last-gasp dash to add to their squad on transfer deadline day - Aaron Ramsey won't be one of those on the move with his attention lying firmly at home.

The Arsenal midfielder took to Facebook to wish his wife, Colleen Rowlands, a happy birthday on Monday.

The childhood sweethearts tied the knot last summer, with the Wales international posting a selfie of the pair together on the social networking site.

He also attached the message: 'Happy birthday to my lovely wife.'

The 24-year-old has been in solid form for the Gunners so far this season, scoring five times in 21 appearances this term - despite missing the entire festive schedule with a hamstring injury. 

Ramsey is expected to feature as Arsene Wenger's side take on arch-rivals Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday afternoon as they seek a fourth successive Premier League win.
