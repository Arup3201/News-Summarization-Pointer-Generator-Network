Looking at these pictures it is perhaps unsurprising that a new Pope has been elected.

Thanks to a rare phenomenon the blazing sun has been pictured over Tibet looking as if it is wearing a halo.

The bizarre bright ring also makes it look like as though a huge eye is in the sky.

Also known as a 'sundog', a solar halo is a distant cousin of a rainbow caused by sunlight shining through a thin layer of cloud called Cirrostratus, which is made up of millions of tiny ice crystals.

The thin cloud cover is up anywhere about 9km above sea level where the temperature is between minus 30C and minus 35C.

The spectacular images were taken by Russian photographer Elena Belozorova who spotted the extraordinary sight while driving to Darchen city.

The 38-year-old from Vologda said it was a truly magical moment.

'I have seen lots of things in my life but I've never seen anything like this before,' she said.

The phenonemen is officially called a 
pathelia but is also known as a 'sundog', 'halo' or 'mock sun'. The 
sight is more commonly seen when the sun is low in the sky and not in 
the middle of the day.

Cultures around the globe have traditionally given great significance and meaning to a sun dog when they see one.

In
 medieval times and early aboriginal forecasting halos were a sign of 
rain on its way - with rain predicted for Friday when the halo will 
disappear.

'The light in Tibet is very special, 
it's fantastic. I've never seen such colours in the sky before. It was 
all so clear and vivid,' said Ms Belozorova.

'The sky is very changeable, every minute there is a different light or pattern.

'We saw the halo as it was created and transformed. We were stunned.

'Even our guides were totally amazed. It looked like a huge eye and occupied half of the sky.

'It almost looked like the entrance to another world.'
