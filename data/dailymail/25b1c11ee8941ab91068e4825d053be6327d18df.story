Google is to close its news-linking service in Spain next in response to a new law which will force it to pay publishers for using their content.

The Internet advertising giant said the new law makes Google News unsustainable and that 'with real sadness' it would remove Spanish publishers from the service on December 16.

'The new law requires publishers to charge Google News for showing even the smallest snippets of their content - whether they want to charge or not,' the company said.

Noticias of closure: Google is to shut down its Google News service in Spain after the country passed a law giving publishers an inalienable right to charge the Internet ads giant for using snippets of their content

Google News shows no advertising and makes no revenue from the service, it noted.

Publishers in countries from Germany and France to Spain have pushed to pass new national copyright laws that force Google and other web aggregators to pay licensing fees when they publish snippets of news articles.

These laws require publishers who want their content to continue to show up in Google search results to give the company explicit permission to do so.

Google has responded by requiring publishers to release it from any liability for licensing fees under such laws.

The Spanish law thwarts this move by Google by giving publishers an 'inalienable' right to levy such licensing fees. It is set to go into effect in January.

Spain's AEDE group of news publishers lobbied for the law, nicknamed the 'Google Tax'. It did not specify how much publishers would have to be paid by Google.

Newspaper publishers and other content providers contend Google News tramples on copyrights by creating a digital kiosk of headlines and story snippets gathered from other websites.

Most venting has been limited to criticism likening Google to a freeloader, but there have been attempts to force the company to change its ways through courts.

Google maintains it obeys all copyright laws while sending more people to websites highlighted in its News services.

The company also allows publishers to prevent material from being displayed in Google News, an option few websites choose because the service is an important traffic source to sell ads.

After Germany revised copyright laws last year in a way that could have required Google News to make royalty payments, Google required publishers to give consent for summarizing content and most did.
