New York City police are investigating an incident caught on grainy video over the weekend in which a visibly pregnant woman is brutally wrestled to the ground and another woman is shoved into a Brooklyn street. 

The video was taken by a shocked witness and, while fuzzy, clearly shows the woman's growing belly and her harsh treatment by police who said she was interfering with the arrest of her 17-year-old son.

The video was posted to the Facebook page of social justice advocacy group El Grito De Sunset Park on Tuesday, setting off an online firestorm.

Shocking: Some members of a Brooklyn community are alleging some shocking police brutality after a video purporting to show the mistreatment of pregnant woman emerged over the weekend

Struggle: Officers in Sunset Park appear to handle the woman very roughly before she's down on the ground and the officers are on top of her

'It's heartbreaking,' activist Jason del Aguila, who works with the Brooklyn organization, told NY1.

The video had hundreds of shares and likes just hours after it was posted by the group. 

According to their attorney, the unnamed woman's son--who does have a criminal record--was first manhandled by police as they arrested him for criminal possession of a weapon. 

Officers then turned to the pregnant woman, who would later get a ticket for disorderly conduct, who then wound up on top of on the ground.

The attorney claims the woman suffered bruises to her abdomen.

While police were cuffing the mother, another woman approaches them and is clearly knocked to the pavement with great force by one of the two unnamed officers.

After she hit the ground and some men came to her aid, she appeared to have some problems standing.

'You broke her arm! That's your badge,' yelled someone behind the camera.

As the struggle with the pregnant continued, the ire of the witnesses--of which there appeared to be many--grew.

'She's pregnant,' the appalled passersby yelled before another man was arrested. 'He didn't do nothing,' reacted one witness.

As public outcry over the apparent police brutality grows, public officials have already reacted to the video.

'I believe this is systemic. The police commissioner must deal with the 72nd police precinct,' Rep. Nydia Velasquez told NY1. 'What we saw in this video of this past weekend is very disturbing. It's overly aggressive tactics and that is wrong.'

It's the second public outcry in a matter of days over alleged police brutality in the police precinct. Just the week before, an officer allegedly kicked a man on the ground in the area during an arrest at a street fair.
