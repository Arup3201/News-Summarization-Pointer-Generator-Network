A market trader has been banned from selling a 'morale-boosting' anti-Taliban T-shirt by council bosses who fear it will offend people.

The T-shirts, which feature the words 'Taliban Hunting Club' around a target set behind a skull and two guns, have become popular with soldiers on the front line as well as their relatives at home.

However stall holder Mark Brown, who runs a military goods pitch a Louth market in Lincolnshire, has been told to stop selling the product by East Lindsey District Council.

Controversial: The 'Taliban Hunting Club' T-shirt which was withdrawn from a market trader's stall following a complaint

Today is the tenth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Afghanistan.

The authority acted after it received a single complaint from a member of the public about the T-shirts, which were described as 'politically sensitive and offensive'.

Mark removed the items from his stall immediately, but he has started a debate on social networking site Facebook to find out if his customers think they are distasteful.

He said: 'This T-shirt is worn by troops as a morale booster and by their families and supporters back home.

'I think East Lindsey Council are being somewhat insensitive towards the troops serving out there.

'Everyone has their own point of view on the subject.

'East Lindsey told me they had received a complaint and said it was politically sensitive and offensive and I voluntarily withdrew it on Wednesday.

'If people do find it offensive on the Facebook site I will withdraw it from the website.'

So far, Mark has sold the t-shirts - unchallenged - at a number of events and market stalls in the area, including the Sandingham Game Fair.

Alan Grant, a fellow Lincolnshire stall holder who runs a greeting cards pitch, believes the product should be allowed back on the market.

He said: 'I can't see the problem, if it was pornographic I would understand. I think it is too much political correctness.'

However other traders have disagreed, with some saying the t-shirt could give the market a bad reputation.

Andy Nisbet, who runs a musical instrument stall, said: 'It could be interpreted as racist. It is a very sensitive issue and you should not make fun out of it.

'I doubt it could be sold on a market in a more multi-cultural city so why should it be any different in rural Lincolnshire?'

A spokesman from East Lindsey District Council said: 'We are aware people have differing views, but the council received complaints from local people and responded accordingly. Mr Brown agreed to withdraw the product.'
