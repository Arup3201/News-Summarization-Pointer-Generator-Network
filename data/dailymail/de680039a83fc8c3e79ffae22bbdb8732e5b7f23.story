A rescue shelter caring for dogs has started photobombing people posting selfies online in a new way to find homes for the pets.

Dallas Pets Alive have been photo-shopping pictures of dogs, or 'muttbombing' as they have called it, on to pictures of famous people including Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus and Ryan Gosling in a bid to rehome the animals.

The dogs, which originally muttbombed people in the local area of Dallas, Texas, have begun to go viral after popping up in selfies posted by celebrities

Some of the dogs take quite an innovative approach to muttbombing people posting selfies online

Leslie Sans, executive director of Dallas Pets Alive, has found the campaign a success so far with several dogs already finding homes since they began muttbombing on February 10.

But she said she hopes all the dogs will eventually be re-homed.

She said: 'We are working with the creative team Dieste who extensively research people every day finding trend-setters, bloggers, popular Instagram profiles and sometimes just random people with interesting profiles and selfies.

'We are targetting Dallas but then we also implemented a few specifics so we could spread muttbombing wider. For example during Valentine's we shaped the posts to be more related to that specific day.

'The initiative was launched February 10 with a special focus on Instagram which is the social media king for selfies which leads users to muttbombing.com to find a complete display of the program.

'The feedback so far has been really positive - with people asking for their friends to get muttbombed or tagging friends to get muttbombed.

'This type of campaign is the first of its kind in the rescue world so people are very excited about it.

'Several of the dogs have found their forever homes, but we want all of our muttbombers to get adopted. There are still homes out there we need to find. Every home we find opens up a foster home so we can rescue another dog at risk.

'The selfie is undoubtedly a worldwide phenomenon that never got a social purpose until now. We wanted a creative approach to reach more audiences.

'Rescue groups have to stay relevant so homeless pets can be adopted, muttbombing is an innovative way to make sure our dogs are visible.'
