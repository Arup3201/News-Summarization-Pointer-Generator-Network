A 15-year-old girl who was bullied by classmates for years has killed herself after naming her tormenters in a suicide note and telling them: 'Thanks for all the pain.'

Cora Delille's body was found by a family member at their home in Pickerington, Ohio on May 10 after she hanged herself, Commander Matt Delp of Pickerington Police said.

She left an emotional note giving a 'myriad of reasons' why she took her life, including classmates calling her names and feeling abandoned by her father and stepfather, he told MailOnline.

'There were complex issues,' Delp 
explained. 'She wrote about her home life and feeling unloved. Her 
mother and stepfather - the father she had known for 14 years - were 
getting a divorce. Her boyfriend had broken up with her the day before. 
There were many reasons.'

Tragic: Cora Delille, 15, hanged herself on May 10 after enduring years of bullying, her friends have said

'Complex': Police said that Cora was also unhappy at home because her mother and stepfather were in the process of a divorce, and that she and her boyfriend had broken up the day before she took her life

She also named at least four fellow students, including girls and two ex-boyfriends, and said they had caused her pain, he said.

Following
 news of her death, friends confirmed to police that Cora had been the 
victim of bullying and name calling at school and on social media.

Authorities
 interviewed the four students who were named in the letter, but did not
 find any conduct worthy of prosecution, he said. There was also no 
evidence of bullying on social networks, he added.

'She
 was the victim of some name calling,' he explained. 'While it's 
troublesome, it doesn't warrant bringing charges against the students.'

Loved: Friends have paid tribute to her online, but bullies have also posted cruel messages on her pictures

Still trolled after death: A bully wrote the message '#f***cora' and called her a 'b****' on Instagram

Close friends said that Cora mostly kept the torment to herself, and her parents said they had no idea the extent to which she was suffering.

'She mentioned here and there when kids made fun of her,' her mother, Amy Hall, told the Columbus Dispatch. 'She didn't clue me in to how bad it was.'

Friends said that students would make passing digs at her in the hallways at school and at lunch, while others said they heard girls calling Cora names at the spring dance recently.

The day before she killed herself, she phoned her best friend Sydney Teal in tears.

'She said she couldn’t take much more,' Sydney told the Dispatch. 'I didn't know what to do. I told her I loved her and 
that I'm here for her.'

Since her death, a friend has heard a student at school say she was happy that Cora was dead, while bullies have also cropped up online, writing insulting words beneath her photographs.

Scene: Friends said that students at Ridgeview Junior High, pictured, would call Cora names and one student said she was glad the teen was dead. School officials said the bullying was never reported

School officials added that Cora had never reported any bullying.

'I've yet to work with anyone who is going to ignore outright bullying when it's taking place,' Superintendent Rob Walker told the Dispatch. 'Can it happen and the teacher not hear it? Yes.'

Her mother, who remembered her daughter as fun-loving and a caring big sister to her younger siblings, hopes that other teenagers will get help before it's too late.

'A lot of other kids are suffering,' her 
mother said. 'They need to know there are other people out there to 
help. They don’t need to keep it inside.'

Cora's funeral, led by her grandfather Pastor Roger Epperson, was held on Wednesday.

Commander Delp said the investigation into her death is now closed.
