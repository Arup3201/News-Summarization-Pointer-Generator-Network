An AFL club in Melbourne is being investigated after allegations that club officials made players as young as 17 run around an oval naked to punish them for a losing streak.

An official complaint was made to the East Burwood Rams club about the naked run, which allegedly occurred on May 22 at an evening training session, by parents of players.

It is believed the nude run was punishment for the team's disappointing season – they have only won one game so far.

The Age reported that some players in the team, which competes in the second division of the Easter Football League, were as young as 17.

Parents of the players complained to the club, who reported the incident to the Eastern Football League, who are now investigating it

The Eastern Football League is investigating the incident after they were contacted by the club over the weekend.

Phil Murton, CEO of the EFL said the investigation may take a week or more, given the number of people they need to talk to.

'We know there is an allegation that something occurred, we're trying to get to the bottom of what occurred,' he told MailOnline.

'The club alerted us to the incident on the weekend, we're talking to players, coaching staff and anyone else.'

Fabian Carrelli, who was brought on as coach of the senior team last year declined to comment on the incident, but in the most recent edition of the club newsletter, Rampage, he expressed his frustration at the performance of his team.

'A very disappointing result in a game we should have won as we let another game slip where we had control for a majority of the contest.

'Kicking with the breeze in the 2nd, we wasted too many opportunities and didn’t capitalise on our forward entries on what was to be a wasteful qtr of footy by our boys.

'It was all downhill for the remainder of the quarter as Bayswater slammed on 9 goals in what I thought was our worst 25mins of footy since my arrival at the club. Enough said!"

East Burwood president Sue Bailey said the club would not comment on the incident.

'I've got nothing to say, all comments are to go through the EFL,' she told MailOnline.
