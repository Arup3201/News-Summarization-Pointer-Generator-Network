Back in fatigues: Sergeant First Class Gilad Shalit, wearing army uniform at an IDF base 
near Kerem Shalom, Israel, this morning, shortly after his release

As footage of the release of Israeli 
soldier Gilad Shalit – pale and drawn after five years as a hostage of 
Hamas – was beamed around the world yesterday, a Palestinian friend 
called me from the main square in Gaza City.

He said he was in the middle of a huge
 and jubilant crowd waiting to welcome home the first of the 1,027 
prisoners for whom Shalit had been exchanged.

The green battle flags of the Islamic 
militant Palestinian group were flying everywhere, he added, before he 
handed his phone to someone he described as a senior Hamas official.

‘This is just the beginning,’ the man 
bellowed over the blare of celebratory music.

‘Now we must seize more 
like Shalit, because without bargaining chips we’ll never get more of 
our own heroes back.’

Half an hour later I spoke to a 
veteran Israeli journalist in Jerusalem, who observed morosely that ‘the
 market price for prisoner exchanges just went through the roof’.

Never before have so many jailed 
Palestinians been swapped for a single captive, he pointed out, and in 
contrast to Israel’s previous refusal to release anyone with innocent 
blood on their hands, those freed yesterday included men and women 
convicted of atrocious attacks on ‘soft’ targets like hotels, pizza 
parlours and discotheques. 

Yet while opponents of the deal for 
Shalit point to the risk that it will encourage further abductions, 
almost 80 per cent of Israelis questioned in a recent opinion poll said 
they backed an exchange.

That helps to explain why prime 
minister Benjamin ‘Bibi’ Netanyahu, normally so hard-line on terrorism, 
felt he could agree to pay such a high price for the  25-year-old 
conscript soldier.

The vast majority of men, and a 
significant number of women, in Israel are liable for up to two years’ 
military service.

Israelis as a whole identify very closely with those 
who risk their lives, and they expect the state to do everything in its 
power to look after them.

Shalit, then a 19-year-old sergeant, 
was abducted in June 2006 by militants who tunnelled into Israel from 
the Gaza Strip and surprised his tank crew, killing two of his comrades.

He was whisked back into Gaza and has since been held incommunicado – 
many believe in underground cells.

A skilfully orchestrated campaign led 
by his family and a growing army of supporters, some of whom camped in 
tents for 15 months outside the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem, 
piled the pressure on Netanyahu’s government to act.

‘Put it this way,’ said my journalist 
friend. ‘Nothing could bring back the people killed by Hamas suicide 
bombings but there was always a chance to save Gilad’s life and Bibi 
obviously felt he could take the risk.’

Shalit is the first Israeli soldier to have been returned alive from captivity by an Arab state for over 25 years.

He is said to have fainted on the 
helicopter taking him home and an initial medical examination showed 
signs of malnutrition and lack of exposure to the sun, officials said.

Earlier, after being taken from Gaza 
to Egypt still flanked by masked Hamas guards, Shalit told local TV he 
had known of his pending release for a week, saying: ‘I always knew I 
would go home.’

For Hamas, the exchange represents a spectacular, and much-needed, propaganda victory. 

The fundamentalist rulers of Gaza 
have seen their popular support plummet in recent months as its bully 
boys clamp down on ‘non-Islamic’ behaviour and the local economy 
struggles with the impact of economic sanctions imposed by the West on 
Hamas.

Many ordinary Palestinians are also 
weary of the organisation’s unwaveringly confrontational stance towards 
the West, especially at a time when the more moderate Palestinian 
Authority is campaigning diplomatically to gain a United Nations seat 
for their country.

Until today, Shalit had not been seen since this video was released in October 2009

In his first interview after being 
released, Shalit said he hoped the prisoner exchange ‘would contribute 
to peace between Israel and the Palestinians’. Yet the prospects of it 
producing any meaningful breakthrough seem slight at best.

One Western observer in Jerusalem 
described the Shalit deal as ‘a kind of commercial transaction, arrived 
at after endless haggling between two sides who don’t really trust each 
other’. That is underlined by the small print,
 under which the release of the second batch of prisoners will not occur
 for another two months.

An Israeli security source says: ‘The 
Palestinians just released will be monitored very closely by our 
intelligence agencies in case they get involved with extremist groups 
again, and if that should happen, everything could be up in the air.’ Meanwhile the raw passions aroused 
among Israeli opponents of the exchange are unlikely to fade, with 
families of the victims of Hamas attacks reacting furiously.

One man who lost his parents and three
 children in a bombing ten years ago raged that Shalit’s father should 
hang out a black flag for his son’s return ‘because for us this is a day
 of mourning’.

In an interview broadcast shortly after his release, Israeli soldier 
Gilad Shalit today told Egyptian television he was 'very excited' about 
returning home
