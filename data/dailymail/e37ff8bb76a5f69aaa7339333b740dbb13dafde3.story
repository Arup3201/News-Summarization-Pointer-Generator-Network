A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving after six-year-old Owen Wightman was knocked down and killed on Saturday. 

The man, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, has been detained by police over the incident in Wakefield and will be interviewed tonight.

It follows heartbreaking scenes as Owen's 12-year-old brother Jake confronted the terrible loss, weeping at the scene of his death.

Among the tributes placed by grief-stricken family and friends, Jack left flowers, a cuddly monkey toy and a note that read: ‘You were the best bro ever. Even when we used to fight and argue I still loved you.’

Detectives have recovered CCTV images
of the car that hit Owen as he crossed a road near his home in 
Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Saturday and are urging the driver to hand
himself in.

After hitting 
Owen, the driver is said to have got out of his car a short distance 
away to inspect the damage before speeding off.

Owen’s
parents, Neil, 33, and Julie, 31, who also have a one-year-old son, 
Thomas, added their voices to the police appeal yesterday.

‘We have lost our baby and ask for someone to please come forward so we can lay him to rest,’ they said.

‘He
was a perfect little man who was taken from us. He walked into a room 
and lit it up. He was our bundle of joy and our ray of sunshine.’

Too much to bear: Jack left flowers, a cuddly monkey toy and a note that read: 'You were the best bro ever. Even when we used to fight and argue I still loved you'

Owen’s death was witnessed by his best friend, Mason Boardman, seven. The pair had been playing in the wooded area next to the busy road when Owen said he was hungry and wanted to go home for something to eat.

It was as he was making his way across the road the vehicle - a hatchback type car - hit the youngster before the driver made off, only stopping a couple of hundred metres up the road to check the damage.

Detective Taylor said at the scene of
the accident on Monday: ’Officers who have been working over the weekend
have recovered CCTV images of the offending vehicle. We have also 
recovered items of debris from the offending vehicle. 

'Bundle of joy': Owen Wightman's parents said he 'was a perfect little man who was taken from us. He was just perfect in every way, a bundle of joy'

‘Those
items and the CCTV images are with the forensic science service as we 
speak and I am very hopeful that the scientists will be able to identify
exactly the make and model of the offending vehicle.

‘I am also hoping that with enhancement of the CCTV we may get a registration number. 

‘That
being the case, I would appeal for the driver to come forward and give 
their version of events prior to us receiving information about what the
vehicle was and prior to us knocking on their door.’

The officer confirmed that the CCTV footage had been obtained from a passing bus and the images were ‘fairly good’. 

Tribute: The scene of the hit and run in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, has been filled with flowers and soft toys in a tribute to Owen

Detective
Taylor also confirmed he had spoken to Mason Boardman, saying: ‘He's 
only a little boy, he's only seven, so it is very difficult for him.’

The devastated father of a Owen told yesterday how he held his dying son and begged: ‘Please don’t leave us, my little soldier.’

Six-year-old Owen was flung into the air as he crossed a road close to his home.

The driver is said to have got out of
his car a short distance away to inspect the damage before speeding 
off. Owen’s horrified best friend watched the tragedy unfold and then 
alerted the boy’s parents. 

Grieving: Neil and Joanne Wightman described their son as a 'proper little lad' as they paid tribute to him following his death

Heartfelt: Members of Owen's family left their own personal tributes at the spot where he was killed

Owen’s father, Neil, dashed to his 
son’s side but by then it was too late. The boy’s mother, Joanne, was 
held back by onlookers because of the nature of her son’s injuries.

Mr Wightman, a landscape gardener, said: ‘I went over to Owen and I was holding him and talking to him. 

‘I
was holding his hand and saying, “Owen, if you can hear me, please 
don’t leave us. I love you so much, you’re my little soldier.”

‘But when I looked at his face I knew really that he was gone. I knew from that blank look that we had lost him.

Lovely smile: Owen Wightman, 6, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in Wakefield on Saturday

‘There were lots of people around Owen and I assumed that one of them was the one who had hit him. 

‘When I was told that the driver had driven off I couldn’t believe it. I thought, “How can someone do that to my baby?”

‘Owen was a proper little lad, cheeky and a handful. He always wanted to be out playing with his mates. He didn’t want to be stuck indoors.’

The crash happened in Fishpond Lane, 
Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Saturday shortly after midday. Owen was 
taken by ambulance to hospital but was pronounced dead.

Mr
Wightman, who has two other sons Jack, 12, and Thomas, one, said 
yesterday that witnesses had seen the man stop his car 200 yards down 
the road. He got out, inspected the damage to the front of his vehicle 
before getting back into the driver’s seat and fleeing.

Owen’s
grieving parents appealed for the driver to hand himself in to police. 
He is described as young, white and was driving a grey or white small 
hatchback-type vehicle.

Fighting
back tears, Owen’s mother, a housewife, pleaded: ‘Whoever has done 
this, please come forward because he has left two brothers behind.’ 

She added: ‘Owen had such a lovely smile. He would walk into a room and light it up.’

‘A woman who was passing saw Owen’s best friend and brought him him to us to let us know what had happened.

‘His
friend said that a car had come zooming down the hill and it had hit 
Owen in to the air and knocked his shoes off. He said the car drove off 
straight away.’

A large number of floral tributes, soft toys and heartfelt notes have been left at the scene. One note, from his parents, reads: ‘ To mummy and daddy’s little soldier, forever in our hearts, love u always.’

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Bottomley, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ‘The vehicle is likely to have front end damage from the collision. I would urge anyone with information to contact the police.’
