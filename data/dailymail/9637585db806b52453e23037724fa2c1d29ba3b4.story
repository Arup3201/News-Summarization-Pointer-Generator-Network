Most shark attack victims would probably wish to forget their terrifying experience as soon as possible.

But one plucky surfer who lost a finger while fighting off a shark off of Port Macquarie in Eastern Australia decided to keep one of its teeth as a memento.

The 29-year-old man, who has not been named, managed to raise a smile while being treated by paramedics, despite suffering serious injuries, including another partially severed finger, a crushed knuckle and a deep gash in his leg.

The surfer had been sitting on his board waiting for a wave when 
the shark struck, biting into his right thigh.

‘He tried to push it off with his left hand and his hand has gone into 
its mouth,’ said Senior Police Constable Chris Rowley after the surfer 
had been taken to hospital in Port Macquarie, north of Sydney.

‘He’s lost the index finger past the knuckle, and another finger was just hanging by shreds I don’t know if it can be re-attached.’

Constable Rowley said the man’s thigh had suffered a ‘slash bite’ rather than losing any flesh and paramedics were confident the wound could be easily stitched up.

The man was able to paddle in by himself on his board with a friend at his side, when they were able to raise the alarm.

He was later flown to hospital in Newcastle, 100 miles north of Sydney. The experienced surfer told police and paramedics that he was reasonably sure he had been attacked by a bull shark measuring about 8ft long.

‘He’s been able to keep a tooth from the attack and give it to the right people,’ said Constable Rowley. ‘I don’t know where he found it – maybe in his board, which was damaged – and put in in his pocket when he got to the beach.’

Experts from the Department of Primary Industries will examine the tooth to confirm the species of shark involved in the attack.

The surfer had been staying at a camping site with his wife, who flew with him to hospital. Kylie’s Beach, at Diamond head, south of Port Macquarie, where the attack occurred, is popular with surfers due to its exposed location and protection from north-easterly winds.

Beaches in the area have been closed as a precaution. Local people said it was extremely rare for a shark attack to occur in the area.

There have been 50 fatalities from shark encounters in Australian waters in the past 50 years, 30 per cent of attacks proving fatal. In recent years, most attacks have occurred off the coast of Western Australia.
