A film camera is expected to fetch £20,000 at auction at Newbury, Berkshire later this year. 

The Kinemacolor changed cinema on its launch in 1908, allowing the capture of moving footage in colour. 

The camera, one of the oldest surviving pieces of equipment, will go under the hammer later this year after being put up for sale by a private owner. 

Previously Kinemacolour projectors have sold for around £4,000 at auctions held by Christies in London.

In 2012, footage taken using the cameras emerged, with sharp moving images of London in the early 1900s shown in colour for the first time. 

The scenes, screened at the Science Museum, ranged from roughly 5 to 40 seconds and showed a parrot, a London street scene, and three smiling children sitting around a table covered with a burgundy cloth batting at a goldfish bowl with large sunflowers.

The clips had long been considered failed prototypes and were consigned to an archive. 

The process came about after years of tireless work by inventor Edward Turner.

When he died, a colour system he had devised to record moving pictures was passed on to American Charles Urban. 

Urban teamed up with film pioneer George Albert Smith to develop it further, with the pair reaching success eventually in the early 20th Century.

Turner had established that by combining the three primary colours (red, blue and green), film makers would be able to depict any other hues. 

Urban and Smith withdrew blue from the wheel after deciding an adequate palette could be reached using just red and green. 

Their happy discovery in 1906 was described in account given by Smith years later. 

'It took about thirty seconds to make the exposure on a specially prepared negative film after which we went into Smith's small darkroom to develop the results in absolute darkness. 

'Within two hours we had dried the negative, made a positive print of the 50 feet length, developed and dried it - and then for the grand test. 

'Even today - after seventeen years, I can still feel the thrill of that moment, when I saw the result of the two-colour process - I yelled like a drunken cowboy - "We've got it - We've got it"'.

It was another two years before the pair were able to unveil the technology to audiences for the first time.
