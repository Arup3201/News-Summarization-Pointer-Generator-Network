Crews searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet launched a targeted underwater hunt for the plane's black boxes, with just days left before the devices' batteries are expected to run out.

The Australian navy ship Ocean Shield, which is dragging a towed pinger locator from the US Navy, and the British navy's HMS Echo, which has underwater search gear on board, will converge along a 150-mile track in a desolate patch of the southern Indian Ocean.

More planes have also joined the search a day after leaders of the two countries co-ordinating the hunt vowed that no effort would be spared to give closure to the families of those on board.

The Boeing 777's data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by the equipment on board the ships.

Race against time: The Boeing 777's data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by the underwater device, but there are only a few days left before the signals stop

But the devices stop transmitting the pings about 30 days after a crash - meaning searchers have only around three days left before the batteries die out.

Locating the data recorders and wreckage after that is possible, but incredibly difficult.

The area the ships are searching was chosen based on hourly satellite pings the aircraft gave off after it vanished from radar on March 8 on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.

That information, combined with data on the estimated speed and performance of the aircraft, led them to that particular stretch of ocean, said Angus Houston, the head of a joint agency co-ordinating the search.

'The area of highest probability as to where the aircraft might have entered the water is the area where the underwater search will commence,' he said.

'It's on the basis of data that only arrived very recently and it's the best data that is available.'

Air crews and ships have been searching for weeks for the Boeing 777, but have so far found no trace of the plane.

Finding floating wreckage is key to narrowing the search area, as officials can then use data on ocean currents to try and backtrack to the spot where the plane entered the water - and where the coveted data recorders may be.

Those devices would provide crucial information about what condition the plane was flying under and any communications or sounds in the cockpit.

Despite weeks of fruitless searching, Mr Houston said he had not given up hope something would be found.

'I think there's still a great possibility of finding something on the surface,' he said. 'There's lots of things in aircraft that float.'

Mission: Search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the Indian Ocean, around 1,100 miles north of Perth, Australia

Fourteen planes and nine ships were 
taking part in today's hunt across an 84,000 square mile expanse of 
ocean, about 1,100 miles north-west of Perth, the Joint Agency 
Co-ordination Centre overseeing the search said.

The
 search area has shifted each day, as the investigative team continues 
to analyse what little radar and satellite data is available while 
factoring in where any debris may have drifted due to ocean currents and
 weather.

'I think we've probably got to the end of the process of analysis,' Mr Houston said.

'And
 my expectation is that we're into a situation where the data we've got 
is the data we've got and we'll proceed on the basis of that.'

Location: Mr Anwar said that the government should not have allowed the international search teams to scour the South China Sea as they would have known the plane was not there

He said it was unlikely that any additional pinger locators would join the search any time soon as they are in scarce supply.

It comes as the Malaysian opposition leader claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country's sophisticated radar system and has accused the authorities of withholding information.

Politician Anwar Ibrahim said that when he was the Malaysian finance minister he had personally authorised the installation of the radar, and that the system would have picked up the missing plane changing course.

The 66-year-old also suggested it was possible that the Malaysian authorities had colluded in the fate of flight MH370, and said an international committee should take over the investigation into the disappearance of the aircraft.

'I believe the government knows more than us. They have the authority to instruct the air force … or Malaysia Airlines,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

'They are privy to most of these missing bits of information critical to our understanding of this mysterious disappearance of MH370.'

Yesterday, Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak flew to Australia for briefings on the search for the Boeing 777 and to meet his Australian counterpart, Tony Abbott, whose country is overseeing the hunt.

'It is a very difficult search - the most difficult in human history. But as far as Australia is concerned, we are throwing everything we have at it,' Mr Abbott said.
