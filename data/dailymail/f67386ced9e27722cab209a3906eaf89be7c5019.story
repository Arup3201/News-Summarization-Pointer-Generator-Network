Stock markets sank for a second straight day Friday on fears earnings growth is faltering.

Weaker than expected results at JPMorgan Chase dragged bank stocks lower while sell-offs in tech stocks once feared to be on the verge of a bubble pushed the Nasdaq composite - down for the third week in a row - to levels not seen in months.

'The market has been trying to come back, but each time the selling just picks up,' said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential. 'The buyers are just not stepping in.'

Many analysts believe the drop is part of a market correction that has been long overdue.

The bears were out early after before-the-open news that JPMorgan had missed analysts' earnings estimates.

Investors worried that technology shares were overvalued dumped them for a second day, with some of the biggest gainers of late falling sharply.

Facebook fell 1.1 per cent, after a 5 per cent drop during Thursday trading. Netflix fell 2.4 per cent, Amazon, 1.7 per cent and Google's new Class C shares, 1.9 per cent.

'A lot of investors were long the momentum trade,' Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist told CNBC.

'All of last year's big winners -- biotech, Internet stocks, this is where you've seen the biggest reversal; that momentum trade has basically been broken.'

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index sank 1.3 per cent to 3,999.73, the first time it has dropped below 4,000 since February 3. The index was down 3.1 per cent for the week, it's worst since June 2012, CNBC noted.

'There's a lot of uneasiness about how far and fast the market ran last year, so any piece of news, even a single earnings report, can have a contagion effect,' Dorothy Weaver, co-founder of Collins Capital, told the network.

Investors are jittery after stocks price surges outpaced earnings growth - the fundamentals did not back the rise in both the tech and banking sectors.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 
143.47 points, or 0.89 per cent, to 16,026.75. The broader S&P 500 fell 17.39
 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 1,815.69.

Dropping stocks outpaced those rising on the New York Stock Exchange by a two to one margin.

Financial analysts expect earnings for companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index to drop 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, according to FactSet, a financial data provider. At the start of the year, they expected a jump of 4.3 per cent.

If profits do fall, it would be only the second quarterly drop in the past three years as the country has desperately tried to claw its way back from the Great Recession.

'Earnings are going to come in on the sloppy side,' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital. 'The market needs to correct,' he added.

A market correction is a sharp downturn in stocks that brings them off highs to where market sentiment believes they belong, but it is not seen as negatively as a bear market - which is what occurred in 2008 at the onset of the recession.

'We're about 7 per cent from the highs, so we're creeping towards what you would classify as a correction, so I wouldn't be surprised, but I don't think we're heading towards bear market territory,' trading firm ConvergEx Group's Peter Coleman told CNBC.

All ten industry sectors in the S&P 500 dropped. Consumer discretionary stocks fell the most, down 1.4 per cent, and technology stocks were the third-biggest decliner, down 1.2 per cent.

Earnings last year for S&P 500 companies rose 6 per cent, but individual stocks rose much faster â€” to the tune of nearly 30 per cent for the index as a whole.

Stocks continued to rise as the Federal Reserve's bond buying program designed to stimulate the economy largely benefited Wall Street.

The slowing, or 'tapering,' of the bond buying has also soured market sentiment as of late.

'Investors haven't worried about earnings because it hasn't mattered. Fundamentals haven't mattered,' said Prudential's Krosby. 'All that has mattered ... is what is the Federal Reserve was going to do.'

She said a 10 per cent correction from highs would be healthy for the market, and give it a sturdier base on which to rally.

The Nasdaq is already well on its way. It is now 8 per cent below its recent high in March. The S&P 500 is off 4 per cent from its recent high on April 2.

JPMorgan Chase, the nation's biggest bank by assets, fell $2.10 Friday, or 3.7 per cent, to $55.30. The firm announced earnings slid 20 per cent in the first quarter as revenue from bond trading and mortgage lending declined, a sign the housing market may be cooling more than expected.

'They're just struggling to grow, and then they didn't have the strength out of the investment bank to help offset that,' said Shannon Stemm, financial services analyst for Edward Jones. 'All around, it's just a lackluster quarter for them.'

Bad results at JPMorgan Chase are seen as a harbinger for worse results across the industry.

Issues outside the finance and tech sectors also made major news during the last trading day of the disappointing week.

General Motors dropped $1.37, or 4.1 per cent, to $31.93 after it said it must fix a second ignition part in compact cars it is recalling for switch problems. It said the fix will increase its first-quarter recall costs above $1 billion.

Gap Inc. fell 89 cents, or 2.3 per cent, to $38.40. The San Francisco-based company, which owns the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy brands, said revenue for stores open at least a year fell 6 per cent.

Zoe's Kitchen, a restaurant chain, soared 65 per cent in its trading debut. The stock gained $9.72 to $24.72.
