Former '30 Rock' star Tracy Morgan has spoken for the first time since leaving a rehabilitation facility for serious injuries he suffered in a car crash that left a fellow comedian dead.

The 45-year-old flashed a grin and a peace sign to photographers as he left his Cresskill, New Jersey, home earlier this week in a black Lincoln Navigator.

The smiling comedian and actor told reporters gathered outside the property: 'Iâ€™m OK, I feel strong,' according to the New York Daily News.

Going home: Tracy Morgan seen for the first time after spending more than a month in a hospital and a rehab facility following a car crash on the NJ Turnpike involving a Walmart truck

'Love you, thank you very much. Appreciate it,' he told the crowd.

The former 'Saturday Night Live' star was considerably thinner and sported a scar on his right temple.

Still, he appeared in much better spirits than in earlier pictures despite needing the aide of a walker to get to the SUV before setting out for the afternoon.

His
 rehabilitation is expected to be long, but he at least will be able to 
continue on an 'aggressive outpatient program,' spokesperson Lewis Kay 
told MailOnline.

Morgan 
suffered a broken leg and broken ribs when the limousine van he was 
riding in was hit from behind June 7 by a Wal-Mart truck on the New 
Jersey Turnpike.

The 45-year-old has spent five weeks in hospital and will now embark on 'aggressive out-patient treatment'

Legal action: Tracy Morgan was released from rehab on Saturday as he is suing Wal Mart after one of the company's truck drivers smashed into his limo leaving him seriously injured

Morgan is suing Wal-Mart over last 
month's highway crash that seriously injured him and killed a fellow 
comedian.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in New 
Jersey, claims Wal-Mart was negligent when a driver of one of its 
tractor-trailers rammed into Morgan's limousine bus.

The
 complaint claims the retail giant should have known that its driver had
 been awake for over 24 hours and that his commute of 700 miles from his
 home in Georgia to work in Delaware was 'unreasonable.'

It also alleges
 the driver fell asleep at the wheel.

Not guilty plea: Kevin Roper (leaving court on June 11), a Wal-Mart truck driver from Georgia, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto on the New Jersey Turnpike on June 7

'As
 a result of Wal-Mart's gross, reckless, willful, wanton, and 
intentional conduct, it should be appropriately punished with the 
imposition of punitive damages,' according to the complaint.

Morgan's lawsuit seeks a jury trial and punitive and compensatory damages.

In a statement issued Saturday, Wal-Mart reiterated that it was 'cooperating fully' in the ongoing investigation.

Deadly:
 A Walmart truck driven by Kevin Roper crashed into the limo bus and the
 driver pled not guilty to charges of death by auto

Devastating damage: Investigators have released images that show the extent of the damage to the Mercedes Benz limo van Morgan was riding in when the accident happened

'We
 know it will take some time to resolve all of the remaining issues as a
 result of the accident, but we're committed to doing the right thing 
for all involved,' Wal-Mart said.

Truck
 driver Kevin Roper, 35, of Jonesboro, Georgia, has pleaded not guilty 
to death by auto and assault by auto charges. A criminal complaint also 
accuses him of not sleeping for more than 24 hours before the crash, a 
violation of New Jersey law.

A
 report by federal transportation safety investigators said Roper was 
driving 65 mph in the 60 seconds before he slammed into the limo van. 
The speed limit on that stretch of the turnpike is 55 mph and was 
lowered to 45 mph that night because of construction.

Returning to strength: A report on the crash that seriously injured the comedian says the driver of a tractor-trailer was speeding before the crash

Tragic: Morgan's close pal James McNair died in the crash

Roper
 had been on the job about 13 1/2 hours at the time of the crash, the 
report concluded. Federal rules permit truck drivers to work up to 14 
hours a day, with a maximum of 11 hours behind the wheel.

The
 June 7 wreck on the New Jersey Turnpike killed 62-year-old comedian 
James McNair, who went by the name Jimmy Mack. Comedian Ardley Fuqua and
 Jeffrey and Krista Millea, who were passengers in the limo, are named 
as plaintiffs. Fuqua is recovering from crash-related injuries.

Morgan, a New York City native, was 
returning from a standup performance at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino 
in Delaware when the crash occurred.
