Publicist Max Clifford, 70, from Hersham, Surrey, arrives at Southwark Crown Court, London. He is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls

‘Cocky’ Max Clifford told a dancer that nobody would believe her if she told how he persuaded her to perform a sex act on him in a nightclub toilet, a court heard today.

The former dancer, one of seven alleged victims of indecent assault by Clifford, broke down in tears as she told Southwark Crown Court, London, how she was assaulted by the PR guru in the early 1980s.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was around 18 when Clifford ‘offered her the chance of playing a Bond girl’.

She said she had taken part in a dance audition in a London nightclub when Clifford, 70, stopped her as she was leaving and claimed he was acting for James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli who was doing screen-testing for the film Octopussy.

The woman told the court: ‘He said, “I’m looking for girls for a Bond film. I work for Chubby (sic) Broccoli and you would be great for it”.

‘He said I can make a phone call and maybe set you up with a screen test.

‘I was very happy about that so I waited for him to make a call.’

The woman, who had previously danced on a television show with Pat Sharp in the early 1980s, said Clifford made a call from a public phone box in the club before calling her over.

She told the court: ‘The person on the phone said they were Chubby Broccoli and that Max thought I would be a good potential for one of the Bond girls.

‘He asked for my vital statistics. It was quite normal to give that.

‘He said...you need to do something before we can agree to the screen test.

‘He asked me if Max was circumcised and asked me to look. I thought it was a joke. I kind of froze. He said it again. Then I realised that I was stuck.’

The woman bowed her head in the witness box and broke down in tears as she spoke during the court hearing.

After composing herself, the alleged victim, who said she was wearing a leotard for the morning audition, told the court that Clifford was ‘smiling’ as he stood beside her during the phone call.

He was ‘calm’ as he then took her by the hand into the male toilets, she said.

The woman added: ‘I was afraid. Just shocked really.’

Asked by prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC why she went with Clifford, the woman replied: ‘I have no idea.

‘All I know I was frightened. It was a man probably older than my father. You trust people who are older than you when you are that young.’

She told the court Clifford pushed her into a toilet cubicle before he undid his trousers and made her touch his erect penis.

The alleged victim, who is now 43 but was around 18 at the time of the alleged indecent assault, told the court how Clifford said he could 'offer her the chance of playing a Bond girl' and said he was in touch with the producer who was doing screen-testing for the film Octopussy, pictured (file picture)

‘He said I had to, I had to masturbate him,’ the woman said.

She told the court Clifford put his hand down her leotard and pulled at her breasts.

‘When I did take my hand away he put it back,’ she added.

'I thought I need to get this over with and get out.

‘He said something very cocky like, no-one is going to believe me, or “Who’s going to believe that?”

‘With hindsight I probably should have slapped him but when you’re young you feel powerless.’

The woman said her behaviour became ‘erratic’ over the next year and she broke up with her first boyfriend as their relationship was ‘ruined’.

She did not tell police at the time because she feared she would not be believed and she later joined a kibbutz in Israel, she told the court.

She said she told her older sister about the alleged incident but swore her to secrecy and only broke her silence with friends at a dinner party after seeing reports of Jimmy Savile’s abuse.

During cross-examination, Richard Horwell QC, defending Clifford, suggested to the witness that the alleged assault ‘simply did not happen’.

The alleged victim replied: ‘I wish I could say that was true.’

Mr Horwell told the woman that Octopussy was released before the alleged incident happened.

She responded: ‘I wouldn’t know. I was young, I didn’t follow Bond films. I’m not a fool. I was young but I’m not a fool. I know what he said. I believed him until the phone call. He knows the truth as I know the truth. I tried to block this from my mind for a long time.’

Judge Anthony Leonard QC later pointed out to the court that the James Bond producer was known as ‘Cubby’ not ‘Chubby’ Broccoli.

Another woman, who is not a complainant in the case, told the court that Clifford tried to show his penis to her during a photoshoot and encouraged her to sleep with influential people to further her career.

She told the court she visited Clifford's office in New Bond Street, central London, in 1986 when she was 18 and working as a dancer and part-time model.

Clifford took her phone number and called her later that evening, she said.

'He said he was interested in me and that I had something quite special,' she said.

'Something for a career in film. He didn't want to go down the TV route.'

The woman, who cannot be named, told the court that Clifford had claimed she was 'very suitable' for a role in the film Labyrinth, starring David Bowie.

The publicist told her there were lots of good-looking and talented people in the world and 'you need to do certain things to get further', she said.

Asked by Ms Cottage what she believed Clifford was referring to, the witness replied: 'You have to sleep with someone if they were interested in you.'

Clifford told the woman that a dinner had been organised at a hotel in High Street Kensington with Bowie and Hollywood actor Walter Matthau, she said.

Clifford claimed that Bowie would 'wink' if he was interested in her for a film role and she would have to go up to a hotel room with the star, the witness added.

'I was really nervous,' she said. 'I didn't turn up. I said I was ill.'

The woman said she attended a recording of Michael Barrymore's gameshow Strike It Lucky with Clifford and another woman in 1986.

On another occasion, she said she went to a flat with the publicist for some promotional photos in which she posed in a swimsuit.

Clifford asked the woman to join him on a sofa when another man went into a room with a woman she believed was Clifford's 'mistress', she said.

She told the court: 'He said "I'm not confident... I've got issues about the size of my penis. It's affected me for years. It's really affected me. Will you have a look?"'

Clifford then took out his penis, she said.

'He said "It's really small but if you touch it, it will get bigger,"' the woman told the court.

Ms Cottage asked the woman if she looked at Clifford's penis after he exposed himself.

She replied: 'No, it freaked me out. I got up and left the room.'

The woman told the court she decided afterwards not to pursue a modelling or dance career because she thought it was 'seedy and horrible'.

She said she told her mother, stepfather and cousin about the alleged incident.

The alleged victim told the court Clifford, pictured, pushed her into a toilet cubicle before he undid his trousers and made her touch his penis. She also told the court Clifford put his hand down her leotard and pulled at her breasts

The woman contacted police from her cousin's home after allegations against Clifford emerged in the press, the court heard.

During cross-examination, Mr Horwell suggested to the witness that Clifford did not show his penis to her.

She replied: 'Why would I say it? What gain would I get from saying it?'

The woman added: 'I thought I was 18, naive, and that's what people do to get ahead, and I'm not doing it.'

Clifford, from Hersham, Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven teenagers aged  14 to 19 between 1966 and 1984.

He denies all the charges.
