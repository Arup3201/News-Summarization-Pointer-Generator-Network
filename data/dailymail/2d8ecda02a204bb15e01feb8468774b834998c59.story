Hannibal Lecter for PM? A Government official suggested putting psychopaths in charge of the country in the aftermath of a nuclear attack

Recently-released documents have revealed that a Government official suggested putting psychopaths in charge of the country in the aftermath of a nuclear attack.

The National Archives has unveiled Exercise Regenerate, a 1982 Home Office plan to keep maintain order in Britain following the nightmarish scenario.

Jane Hogg, a scientific officer in the Home Office who worked on the operation, advocated that a psychopath's logic, intelligence, ability to cope in a crisis and lack of morals would make them ideal leaders in the chaos that would ensue after the bomb.

'It is... generally accepted that around one per cent of the population are psychopaths,' she wrote.

'These are people who could be expected to show no psychological effects in the communities which have suffered the severest losses.

'They are very good in crises, as they have no feelings for others, no moral code, and tend to be very intelligent and logical.

'Pre-strike the only solution for these people is to contain them; post-strike, in the immediate aftermath, the formal authorities may well find it advantageous to recruit these people into their organisations as they could prove an exceptionally valuable resource.'

Notes on the plan reveal her colleagues did not feel the same way: 'I am not at all sure you convince me. I would regard them as dangerous whether or not recruited into post-attack organisation.'

Lord Hennessy, author of The Secret State, told the BBC the plan was 'extraordinary' and 'bizarre', but the suggestion was 'stamped on pretty quickly'.

'They always take my breath away,' he said of the Government's Cold War planning. 'The sense of civil servants having to look into the abyss, imagine the unimaginable.'

The end of all things: Government officials were forced to consider what steps would need to be taken if Cold War tensions boiled over in to an all-out nuclear exchange. File picture

Lord Hennessy also spoke of a plan to use the Royal Yacht to whisk away the Queen, Prince Phillip and the Home Secretary if nuclear war broke out.

Exercise Regenerate focused on the first six months of life after Nuclear War and was based in Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire.

The exercise set out a series of events that emergency services and civil servants would have to respond both as a strike loomed and after detonation.
