A mother has told how her son wrote a suicide note on the back of a bank letter demanding the repayment of his £3,000 overdraft.

Toby Thorn, 23, took his life after racking up the overdraft on top of a £5,000 student debt.

On the reverse of a letter from Barclays, he wrote simply: ‘Thank you to all my friends I appreciate all your support, Later ANON.’ His body was found soon afterwards.

Beloved: Anne Thorn has become a trustee of Papyrus following the death of her son Toby

Yesterday his mother Anne said she had no idea her son was so anxious about his financial situation.

Toby had dropped out of a degree 
course in computing in his third year and was hoping to start a 
business. But as he moved into a flat with friends, he was apparently 
agonising over his £8,000 debts.

Single mother Mrs Thorn, 56, said: ‘Young people can’t find jobs, so they can’t see a way out of debt.

'It’s unbearable to think that Toby didn’t know how much he was loved.’

Determined: Anne wants to help other young people with financial worries

Debt: Paperwork shows Toby Thorn's £3,000 overdraft and outstanding student loan

An inquest ruled that Toby’s debt was a major contributory factor in his suicide.

Mrs Thorn said: ‘He said university 
just wasn’t for him, so we looked at other options. I had no idea his 
debts were bothering him so much. I don’t believe that’s the only reason
 why he took his own life but it must have been a big contributing 
factor.

‘People don’t realise that suicide is
 so common in young people, especially young men. Men  don’t talk about 
their feelings. They keep it all bottled up which can lead to 
depression.’

According to a YouGov poll, money was
 the most common worry across the UK last year, and calls to the 
Samaritans’ helpline about financial concerns have doubled in the past 
three years.

Following her son’s death in  July 
last year, Mrs Thorn, a customer relations officer, became a trustee for
 the charity Papyrus, which aims to prevent suicide in the young.

Statistics released by the charity 
show that around 1,400 under-35s kill themselves in the UK every year, 
and three-quarters are men.

Mrs Thorn said: ‘It is a national 
scandal that the Government is not doing more. Although they have 
promised £1million for research, there is no action and no 
implementation plan.

Good work: PAPYRUS aims to increase awareness of young suicide and how to prevent it

‘Young people should be encouraged to reach out for help, but debts are making them feel backed into a corner.’

Toby, from Penzance, Cornwall, had been studying at Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge.

His mother said: ‘I now know  that 
Toby was in so much pain  that he was not able to consider the impact 
his death would have on me when he took his own life, and if he was he 
thought he was doing me a favour.’
