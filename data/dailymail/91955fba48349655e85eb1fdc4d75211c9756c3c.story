More young black men die as a result of murder than those killed as a result of suicide, accidents and disease put together, a shocking new article has claimed.

The report, by a professor at Florida Atlantic University, showed that murder was 'by far and away' the leading cause of death among young black men.

By contrast, the article, published in the April issue of the American Journal of Medicine, revealed, young, non-black men of all ethnicities were also 'by far and away' most likely to die in accidents.

A shocking article by Florida Atlantic University physician Charles H Hennekens says the vast majority of young black American men who die do so because of murder

Charles H Hennekens, the report's author, called the findings - and his article - 'the new American tragedy', and described the death of so many young black men by murder as 'a devastating epidemic'.

He said black men were six times more like to die as a result of murder and seven times more likely to commit murder than their white counterparts.

Dr Hennekens also provided the shocking statistic that while only one-eighth of the American population was black, half of the country's homicide victims are black, giving them a reduced life expectancy of more than six years.

Citing figures covering the deaths of young men aged 15-34 between 1999 and 2009, the physician said there were 106,271 homicides, 85% (89,887) of them among men and 49% (52,265) of them among black men.

Even in states with relatively low levels of young black men being murdered, the figure still soared above that of those killed in accidents.

Dr Hennekens, of FAU's school of medicine, compiled statistics from several sources to write his article.

Dr Hennekens says firearms are a major factor in the murders of young black men - 91 per cent of such murders involve guns

Addressing the issue of firearms, he said 91% of murders among black men were as a result of guns, and said it was the duty of doctors to identify risks to public health and bring their findings to the attention of policy-makers, 'even if the threats are lawful'.

He added: 'For example, cigarettes are both lawful and popular, but public health support of laws controlling their exposure to the general population has contributed to the reduction of the premature mortality they cause.'

Dr Hennekens said: 'Death is inevitable, but premature death is not, including among young black men.'
