A South Carolina stripper has been arrested after allegedly beating a female coworker with a stiletto at a gentlemen's club  - leaving her with stab wounds and swelling to her head.

Carolynn Wright, 22, reportedly confronted bartender Ashley Michaels-Hoder, 24, in the bathroom of Chez Joey strip joint in Myrtle Beach at 2am last Thursday and grabbed her by her hair.

She then repeatedly beat her with 'a clear plastic high-heeled shoe', causing her to suffer a swollen left eye, swelling to her forehead and two puncture wounds that needed stitches.

Now, Wright has been charged with a felony count of aggravated assault in connection with the attack, according to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun. Her motive remains unknown.

The suspect, who sported several facial piercings with her wavy blonde hair loose in her mugshot, appeared in General Sessions court on Tuesday morning. Her bond was set at $5,000.

During the alleged assault, Ms Michaels-Hoder was unable to defend herself because Wright was holding her head down, the victim told officers during an interview in hospital.

When she eventually managed to lift her head, 'the offender struck her multiple times in the face with the same shoe,' the police report said.
