Roberto Martinez has launched an impassioned defence of the FA Cup's enduring appeal and described it as having 'a philosophy that allows everyone to dream.'

The Everton boss knows all about the Cup's ability to make dreams come true after leading Wigan to a shock 1-0 win over Manchester City in last May's Wembley final.

As he prepared for a third-round tie with QPR at Goodison Park, he made it clear he was at odds with Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert's claim that it was an 'unwanted distraction.'

Reflecting on the way his Wigan side 
defied the odds last season, and how he joined a club with a rich Cup 
tradition when he agreed to take over from David Moyes in the summer, 
Martinez said:'It is unique. Every country has a knock-out 
competition, but there is nothing in the football world that compares 
with the FA Cup.

'It is 
unique in its unpredictability and also in its philosophy that anyone is
entitled to chase a dream. We are going to give it everything we have 
got, here at Everton, and we are all looking forward to third-round 
weekend.

Controversial: Paul Lambert risks the wrath of Aston Villa fans after saying his side could do without the FA Cup

'Do I understand 
Paul Lambert's comments? I can understand what he is saying, because 
every manager knows his squad and the numbers at his disposal. I am 
looking at 21 or 22 players who are all ready to represent Everton, and 
that excites me.

'But 
if you've got 11 players, and you are facing two cup competitions, as 
well as a League programme, it is a different matter.

'Each manager has 
to assess the situation and make his own decision.

'I
have seen for myself that a good run in the Cup can generate 
competition for places, and that can have a beneficial effect.

'It can 
present an opportunity for a young player, and suddenly he becomes a 
regular in the side by grabbing it with both hands.

'It
is vital to the fans that we try and win a trophy, and I am very aware 
that the association between Everton and the FA Cup is quite remarkable.
I am fascinated by the links between this club and the Cup over the 
years.

'I have read all 
about the 1933 final being the first one where numbers were worn, how 
Everton wore one to 11 and their opponents 12 to 22 and how that made 
Dixie Dean the first-ever No 9.

'More recently, how the Cup was 
the first trophy for Howard Kendall and for Joe Royle.

'So
the Cup and Everton have had a beautiful relationship, and I am excited
about the challenge of trying to add a few more chapters to the success
story.'
