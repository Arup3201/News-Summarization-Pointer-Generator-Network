Former world champion boxer Antonio Cermeno was kidnapped and killed in his native Venezuela amid ongoing violence, police said Tuesday.

Cermeno, a WBA super bantamweight and featherweight champion in the 1990s, was found shot to death today on a road in the central state of Miranda, local police chief Eliseo Guzman said.

Guzman said Cermeno and other relatives were kidnapped Monday night near the La Urbina neighborhood in east Caracas.

The relatives were able to escape to 
safety when the kidnappers stopped to refuel the car, but the former 
boxer remained captive, Guzman said.

Cermeno, 44, retired in 2006 with a 45-7 record.

The blog BoxingScene reported Tuesday that Cermeno was snatched Monday night near the hotel Makro La Urbina, where he was staying with his family.

His body turned up early this morning along the Caucagua-Higuerote Highway.

Born in 1969 in Rio Chico, Cermeno was proclaimed the WBA champion after defeating Puerto Rican boxer Wilfredo Vazquez in 1995.

After his retirement from professional boxing, Cermeno devoted his time to charity work and promoting young athletes as part of the program Street Boxing in Venezuela.

His slaying comes on the heels of the killing of beauty queen Genesis Carmona, 22, who was shot in the head by members of the armed militias known as 'colectivos' who opened fire on a demonstration in Valencia last Tuesday.

In early January, popular soap-opera actress and former Miss Venezuela Monica Spear, 29, and her husband, 39-year-old Thomas Henry Berry,  were killed by robbers.

The couple were returning to the capital city of Caracas with their 5-year-old daughter when they were ambushed and shot dead.

The high-profile slayings highlight spiraling violent crime in Venezuela, which is one of the spurs to opposition protests that have rocked the South American country in recent weeks. The United Nations ranks Venezuela's homicide rate as the fifth highest in the world.

The non-government Venezuelan Observatory of Violence estimates the country's murder rate has quadrupled in 15 years of socialist rule.

Also on Tuesday, Mario Briceno Iragorry, the mayor of the coastal Venezuelan city of Maracay, said that an anti-government protester was found dead inside a supermarket during a violent clash.

Details about the man were not immediately available. His death brings the toll to at least 16 since a series of protests that began February 12.

The protests have declined in recent days and the capital was largely free of barricades on Tuesday.

Opponents of President Nicolas Maduro have been staging countrywide protests that the government says have left more than a dozen dead and at least 150 wounded.

Authorities have detained 579 people, of whom 45, including nine police officers and members of the National Guard, remain in custody, Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz said.

The opposition blames Maduro's administration for the country's high crime rate and economic troubles and says his socialist-inspired polices have led to shortages of basic goods and inflation above 50 per cent, among the world's highest, despite the country's vast oil reserves.

The president blames the violence on right-wing opponents of his government, accusing them of receiving support from abroad.
