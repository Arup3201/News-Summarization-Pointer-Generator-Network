First Lady Michelle Obama will fill nearly two dozen of the seats in her State of the Union box with individuals representing key initiatives being promoted by her husband during the annual address to Congress.

Among the first lady's guests are Alan Gross, the American aid worker recently released from a Cuban prison after a five-year detention, and his wife, Judy; Nicole Hernandez Hammer, a Guatemalan immigrant who raises awareness within the Latino community about climate change, and astronaut Scott Kelly, the brother-in-law of former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. 

Giffords, the victim of a 2011 shooting, is married to Kelly's twin brother, Mark. She resigned three years ago in January, a day after being recognized at Obama's 2012 State of the Union.

Anthony Mendez, a freshman in college and beneficiary of FLOTUS' Reach Higher Initiative who spent part of his formative years in a homeless shelter after his family was evicted from their home, and 13-year-old Malik Bryant, the Chicago teen who wrote Santa a letter asking for 'safety' and received a response from the president, will also join Mrs. Obama on Tuesday night, the White House revealed on Tuesday.

The first lady typically uses her invites to highlight beneficiaries of her husband's policies, and this year will be no exception

U.S. contractor Alan Gross takes a selfie with his wife, Judy Gross, on board a government plane headed back to the U.S. on December 17 after being released in a prisoner exchange. Alan Gross was held in Cuba for five years as a political prisoner until Barack Obama negotiated his release last month as part of a deal to normalize relations with Cuba. The Grosses will sit in FLOTUS' box tomorrow night at the SOTU

The first lady's guest list offers an early look at themes President Barack Obama will hit on in tomorrow evening's speech before a joint session of Congress. 

Obama is expected to defend his decision to normalize relations with Cuba, a move that's been met with criticism by a of a bipartisan group of lawmakers that include Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants whose state, Florida, boasts the highest number of Cuban Americans.

Embargoes on the Communist country haven't worked, Obama contends, and should be rescinded.

He'll also brag about the economic recovery in the United States, highlighting the receding unemployment rate and resurgence of the manufacturing industry as proof positive that his administration's policies have been a success, and promote a multinational agreement with China to reduce CO2 emissions by a target rate of 28 percent by 2025.

The tone of Obama's sixth State of the Union is anticipated to be more upbeat than his past addresses and serve as an inspiration to Americans to live up to their fullest potential while reminding them how far the nation has come since he took office. 

The president will use Kelly's presence at the speech to promote scientific research that will help 'support the next generation of space exploration and President Obama’s goal of sending humans to Mars by the 2030s,' the White House told Politico.

Kelly will soon participate in a yearlong mission aboard International Space Station. He and his twin brother, a retired astronaut, are the subject of a research initiative that will compare data from the two men's bodies while in space.

White House letter writer Carolyn Reed, a Colorado native, will serve as a visual reminder of what small business owners have been able to achieve during Obama's administration with help of the government.

'Thanks to a loan from the Small Business Administration,' Obama said in his weekly address, Reed and her husband were able to expand their businesses and raise wages for their employees.

Victor Fugate, another letter writer, whom Obama recognized in a Kansas City, Missouri, speech last year, represents the success of Obamacare. 

'Because of the Affordable Care Act, [Victor and his wife] now have the security and peace of mind of affordable health insurance,' Obama claimed in his Saturday morning address.

The president will also give immigration reform a shout out, as well as his executive actions to protect illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, also known as DREAMers, from being deported, as well as their parents.

Letter writer Ana Zamora, a senior at Northwood University in Texas, will sit in the first lady's box and serve as Obama's token Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program success story.

Obama has revealed in sneak peaks of his address that he will also needle Congress to pass laws his administration believes will further lift up the middle class.  

Obama will formally ask the Republican-controlled legislative body to require businesses to give all their workers a week of paid sick days and at least six weeks of paid leave for new parents.  

In a nod to paid sick leave, Maryland Senate Majority Leader Catherine Pugh, author of a bill in her state to provide employees with seven days of paid absence, will also sit with Mrs. Obama.

Also sitting in FLOTUS' box tomorrow night are Nicole Hernandez Hammer, a Guatemalan immigrant who raises awareness within the Latino community about climate change, and Ana Zamora, a senior at Northwood University in Texas. Zamora will serve as Obama's token Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program success story

Anthony Mendez, a freshman in college, is the beneficiary of FLOTUS' Reach Higher Initiative. Mendez, center right, spent part of his formative years in a homeless shelter after his family was evicted from their home. He is the first person in his family to graduate from high school

He'll also ask for billions of dollars from Congress to make community college free to most graduating high school seniors.

The White House announced over the weekend that Obama is again seeking to levy an eight percent capitol gains tax increase on the wealthy couples. He also wants to close a loophole on capital gains that stops inherited funds from being taxed.

Republicans have already shot down every initiative the president has revealed so far. 

A top House member called Obama's tax plan a 'non-starter' on Sunday.

'We’re not just one good tax increase away from prosperity in this nation,' House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz said on CNN’s State of the Union.

The president has already set to work on some new measures from his State of the Union address that he's previewed this month that he's able to enforce without the compliance of Congress.

He announced the first week in January that his administration would reduce mortgage premiums for first-time home buyers who obtain loans through the Federal Housing Administration to make ownership more feasible for average Americans.

And in a memorandum last week, Obama directed the federal government to immediately put a six-week paid family leave policy into effect for its employees.

Members of Congress often use their guests to make political statements, as well, and today Rubio announced that he would bring Rosa María Payá, the daughter of a late Cuban activist, as his guest tomorrow night.

'All Oswaldo Payá wanted was a better future for Cuba and the Cuban people, and the Castro regime assassinated him for it,' Rubio said in a statement today. 'Since her father’s murder, Rosa María has honored his legacy by continuing to advocate for a free and democratic Cuba and also fighting to bring his murderers to justice.

The Florida Republican and possible 2016 presidential candidate said Obama's Cuba policy that gives the Castro regime' legitimacy and greater access to American dollars' will only be used to fund the foreign government's 'machine of repression – the very machine that harassed Oswaldo Payá for years, eventually murdered him and pays hush money to potential key witnesses.'
