Jimmy Bullard opted to head for the jungle after losing £625,000 in an investment scheme.

The former Fulham midfielder – who retired two years ago following a series of crippling knee injuries – is among 10 famous faces to descend on Australia for the annual I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! show.

But his appearance is down to monetary concerns rather than a thirst for publicity, reports The Sun.

His most famous celebration came in the form of a mock team-talk he gave his Hull team-mates in 2009

Bullard, who at the height of his earning power took home £45,000 a week at Hull, will pocket around £100,000 for his appearance Down Under as he bids to recoup some cash sunk in the scheme.

A number of Premier League stars, including ex-Tottenham striker Robbie Keane, are said to have lost out.

They had been told the project – run by City financial experts – would invest in companies on the rise and make quick money. Michael McIndoe, who played left wing for Wolves in his pomp, is said to have approached potential investors.

Carl Fogarty and Forde have also both landed in Australia ahead of ITV show I'm a Celebrity

Bullard ended up losing thousands in the fund, with Scotland Yard confirming that they are investigating fraud allegations made in February but that no arrests had been made.

The developments show why Bullard was willing to take ITV up on their offer, according to a source close to the 33-year-old.

‘The money isn’t normally anywhere near enough for Premier League footballers,’ they said.

‘Losing so much cash explains why he was keen to go.’
