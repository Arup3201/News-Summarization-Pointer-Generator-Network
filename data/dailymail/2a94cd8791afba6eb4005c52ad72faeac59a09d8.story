'Infectious smile': Teachers at the university paid tribute to Zach McClendon after his body was found on Wednesday

Three men have been charged over the death of a promising grad student who was gunned down on his doorstep in a suspected bungled robbery.

The body of Zach McClendon, 25, was discovered on the grounds of his student accommodation at the University of Mississippi - where he was studying for a masters degree in business administration - with a single gunshot wound on Wednesday.

And today police revealed they have arrested two fellow students at the university and a third man from Texas on suspicion of murder.

Steven Wilbanks, 22, from North Carolina, Derrick Boone, 23, from Laurel, Miss., and Joseph Lyons, 20, from Houston, Texas, were being questioned by detectives today.

It is believed at least one of the three
 suspects lived in the apartment next door to McClendon's, where crime 
scene tape also covered the neighbor's door.

The University of Mississippi said in a statement Wilbanks is French major while Boone studies banking and finance.

All three have been denied bail.

McClendon, a native of Gulfport, was seeking his master's degree in business administration, the university said.

'The University family is shocked and saddened to learn of the death of Zach McClendon,' said Dean of Students Sparky Reardon. 'We feel pain and loss any time one of our students is taken from us. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends and we, as a University family, will do all that we can to support them.'

Charged: Joseph Lyons, 20, from Houston, Texas, was also being questioned by detectives today. He is understood not to be enrolled in the university

Vice President of Student Services and Enrollment Management Susan Scaggs added: 'I think he really believed in the importance of education and the difference an education can make in a person's life.

'Understanding the road out of poverty runs by the schoolhouse door and helping as many people as possible get on that road in a positive way was a real gift that he had.

Crime scene: McClendon was killed near where he lived in the College Hill community off County Road 140. It is believed one of the three men lived next door

'I will never forget his smile. Once you got a look at Zach's infectious smile, you will never forget it.'

Meanwhile, residents who live in Mr. McClendon's neighborhood expressed their shock over a shooting in the area.

'It's a little unnerving. It really is,' said fellow student Corey Hamil. 'There's never been anything like this 
happen, even remotely close. It's always just quiet and 
you never think anything could happen, and it's like, where did this 
come from? Why did it happen? All of these questions.'
