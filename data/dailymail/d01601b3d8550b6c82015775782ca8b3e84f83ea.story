Condoms are the latest packing-list essential for those about to embark on a cruise. 

A new survey of 200,000 cruise passengers has revealed that prophylactics topped passengers' list of items that they must have while they're spending days or weeks at sea.

Cruise.co.uk has revealed that cruise ships have become a haven for sexual activity, with 80 per cent of passengers admitting to being sexually active while on board.

Eighty per cent of cruise ship passengers admit to being sexually active while on board

A survey of 200,000 cruise enthusiasts from Cruise.co.uk found that condoms are a packing-list must have

However, the company's analysis also found that while sex at sea is on the rise, sexual health products available on board cruise liners do leave something to be desired.

Most modern cruise lines are simply ill-equipped to facilitate these needs, with 70 per cent failing to sell condoms on board and 80 per cent of ships not offering the morning after pill. 

Some cruise lines, such as Royal Caribbean and MSC, do allow guests access to condoms, pregnancy kits and lubrication.

P&O, Cunard and Princess provide the morning after pill.    

More than 30 per cent of those surveyed about sex on board cruise ships were aged 65 and over 

Another shocking find: one in five of those polled admitted to cheating on their partner while on a cruise. 

And what's even more surprising is that 80 per cent of those who cheated said it happened while they were on a cruise with their partner.

Getting busy on board isn't restricted to younger passengers. More than 30 per cent of those surveyed were aged 65 and over.

Many ships are ill-equipped - 70% don't sell condoms on board and 80% don't offer the morning after pill

A third of cruisers also admitted to bringing a sex toy on board, with nearly 12 per cent claiming that they would never take to the seas without one. 

Seamus Conlon, managing director of Cruise.co.uk, said: 'Following the government's recommendations towards the end of last year for older generations to take condoms on holiday and ahead of the release of Fifty Shades of Grey across cinemas nationwide, we decided to survey our database of over 200,000 cruise enthusiasts on their attitudes towards sexual health.'
