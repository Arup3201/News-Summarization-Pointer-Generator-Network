Online check-in has made it easier to reserve your place on a fight, but it can’t stop the dreaded bag drop queues when you arrive at the airport.

In a bid to solve this, Air France and KLM have created a digital tag, and tracking device that not only let you bypass this airport chore, but could also spell the end of lost luggage.

Both devices are linked to the airlines' Flying Blue accounts and flight information is automatically updated before every journey.

Air France and KLM created the eTag, pictured, to reduce the queues at airport bag drops. The tag is linked to a customer account and details are automatically updated before every journey. The scheme will launch by the end of the year, but prices have not been announced

In October, British Airways began customer-trials of new re-useable digital bag-tags - similar to those unveiled by Air France and KLM.

The electronic bag-tag is used by passengers who have their booking details sent to a smartphone using the British Airways app.

Under the scheme, passengers use their smartphone to check in, choose their seat and obtain their mobile boarding pass.

The app then automatically updates the digital bag-tag with a unique barcode, containing flight details.

The system consists of the eTag and eTrack.

The eTag is fixed to suitcases and means travellers can drop off their luggage without having to re-label it each time they fly. 

While the eTrack traces luggage around the world, in case it’s lost, left behind or stolen via a smartphone.

Once the devices are connected to a Flying Blue account, flight details are updated when a new booking is made, and the tag is activated shortly before each journey. 

The eTrack is then placed inside the luggage and can be traced online, while the tag is securely fixed to a handle using padlock codes. 

The eTag, pictured left, can also be used with the eTrack, pictured right. The eTrack traces luggage around the world, in case it's lost, left behind or stolen. It is placed inside luggage and can be traced using a smartphone or on the web

Following the official launch, the devices will be sold together, or separately, and there is a Samsonite case which features both devices as standard

The companies are aiming to go live with the first customer groups at the end of 2014.

Air France and KLM’s plans were detailed on a YouTube video, but the companies have not officially announced the scheme. 

MailOnline has contacted the firms to ask about the security of the tags, what measures are in place to prevent hack attempts, and what happens if the luggage is overweight.

It is thought the airlines will set up a designated bag drop off point for its eTag customers so they can avoid the queues.

It will also be launching a range of colours for the tag, to match different bags. 

Following the official launch, the devices will be sold together, or separately, and there is a Samsonite case which features both devices as standard. 

Price details have not been revealed.
