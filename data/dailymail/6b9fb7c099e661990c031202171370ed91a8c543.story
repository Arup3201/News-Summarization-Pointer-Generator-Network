Tiger Woods is 'in no hurry' to hire a new swing coach - as he has yet to swing a club during his latest injury lay-off.

The former world number one's last PGA Tour action came on August 3, when he withdrew after eight holes of his final round at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational having aggravated a back problem.

Since then his focus has solely been on strength work, meaning the search for Sean Foley's replacement - following their split three weeks ago - can wait.

'Am I looking for a new coach? As of right now, no, I'm not,' Woods told reporters at a press conference to announce a new sponsor for his tournament, the Hero World Challenge, where he is due to make his comeback in early December.

'I'm in no hurry to look for one. Right now I'm just trying to get physically better, stronger, faster, more explosive.

'I've just been shadow swinging without a club, but I've been busting my butt in the gym pretty hard.

'I've got my strength back, which is nice. Now the next goal is to get my explosiveness and my fast twitch (muscles) going, and that's the next phase of my training.'

Woods admits that with hindsight, he returned too soon at June's Quicken Loans National, where he missed the cut. 

Four of his seven tour appearances this season resulted in missed cuts or withdrawals, while his best finish was 25th at the WGC-Cadillac Championship.

'Would I like to play? There's no doubt, yes,' he said. 'I miss competing, I miss playing, I miss being out here with the guys, I miss all that, but I'm not physically ready for it yet.

'As far as coming back this summer too soon, I felt good enough to do it and the only unfortunate part is I couldn't maintain the conditioning.

'As the tournament would wear on, I would get more and more fatigued and tired and I wasn't as explosive.'
