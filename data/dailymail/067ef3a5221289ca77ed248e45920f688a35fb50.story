It is a site seen as such an impressive example of landscape garden design it has been named on the World Heritage List.

Usually packed with visitors during the summer, Kunming Lake is one of Beijing's best known tourist destinations. It is often used as the central stretch of water to explore the gardens and waterways of the complex Summer Palace in Beijing in China.

But locals have taken advantage of the recent cold snap which has frozen the lake solid and have taken to it with carts on wheels and sledges.

Dozens of tourists took sledges and carts onto Kunming Lake, part of the Summer Palace in Beijing in China, after the lake froze over 

The mercury plunged to -9C  between Christmas and New Year and the freezing temperatures are forecast to continue throughout this week and during much of January.

Dozens of people could be seen in carts and other contraptions to enjoy the icy conditions on Kunming Lake this weekend as temperatures reached -7C last night.

Some were seen on bikes while others appeared to be on a form of sledge, armed with poles to help them slide along the icy surface.  

The lake is man-made and a central feature of the Summer Palace. People rowing the lake can get views of Longevity Hill and the Tower of Buddhist Incense situated there.

China traditionally marks the long winter period of cold weather with the Harbin Ice and Snow Festival held at sites throughout Beijing 

The palace covers 2.9 square kilometres, or 490 acres, and is made up of three quarters of water - in which Kunming Lake is the central feature. Hills and water are combined with bridges, halls, palaces and temples to make up the site and it is usually flooded with visitors every summer.

Lake Kunming is a popular cruising and rowing location.  

And yesterday locals took to explore it on sledges and carts on wheels, as they raced around the icy stretches.

Temperatures rarely reach above 0C in China during January and February, and the number of people on Kunming Lake could be a fitting start to the annual Harbin Ice and Snow festival held in Beijing.

Harbin Ice and Snow festival began in 1963 and officially begins tomorrow on January 5.

Kunming Lake used to a reservoir and was converted into an imperial garden under the rule of Qianlong Emperor between 1750 and 1764. It remains shallow but was widened to create the Summer Palace. The palace was included on the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998 and was declared ' 'a masterpiece of Chinese landscape garden design.'
