It's like tearing down a child's hopes and dreams.

Genevieve and Chris Montgomerie, from Mosman Park, in Perth's western suburbs, have been ordered by their local council to remove the DIY cubby house they built for their three children.

The order from Mosman Park Council follows complaints that had been made by their neighbours claiming the cubby blocked their views and compromised their privacy.

Mr and Mrs Montgomerie started to built the elaborate tree house in their backyard in mid 2013 and have been in a dispute with neighbours and council since October.  

It started out as a simple DIY project to encourage their three children Hugo, 7, Grace, 5, and Louie,2, to play outdoors rather than watch television or play video games.

The couple did not realise that building the child's play area in their Mosman Park home only 20 minutes outside Perth needed council approval.  This was only made clear to them after the neighbours complained.

'What people are forgetting to mention is that there is a four-metre lane way between the two properties,' Mrs Montgomerie told the Today show on Thursday morning.

The neighbour's property faces the back of the Montgomerie cubby and a laneway.

Mr Montgomerie added a roof, railings and swings to add some safety to the kids play area.

Ron Norris, Mosman Park Council Mayor told ABC News he was sympathetic to the Montgomeries, but council has an obligation to act when it received complaints.

'My attitude to a lot of those things is that people should be able to do what they want in their own backyards without much interference from council, unless it does have some adverse impact on surrounding properties,' he said.

'Living space for the kids outside where they can play is a good thing, but if it adversely affects the neighbours then they are entitled to an opinion as well.'

'In the beginning it was more than one complaint, but we spoke to the neighbour and while she wasn't happy at first she was so moved by the children's love of their cubby house that she came around,' Mrs Montgomerie told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's funny now that the only person complaining doesn't even have a house on the block of land behind the cubby, his house would just be overlooking a laneway not just our yard and cubby.'

In the meantime, Ms Montgomerie said she is hopeful an amended plan may give the tree house a last-minute reprieve.

The railings were added for safety but may need to be removed in order to comply with council

Council has told the family that they may approve the new plans if they remove the railings and other parts of the cubby which were added for the children's safety.

On the Today show, Hugo, the oldest Montgomerie boy told Lisa Wilkinson, 'If they tore it down it would be horrible because all of my friends who come over love it and I love it.'

Although the family is passionate about fighting the dispute, they do not want it to affect their relationship with their neighbours.

'We tried to do the neighbourly thing and went around to chat to all out neighbours before we knew who made the complaints, because we care so much about our neighbourhood,' said Mrs Montgomerie.

'At the end of the day if it has to come down, it has to come down. We just hope council will reconsider the amended plans,' said Mr Montgomerie.

The family will find out the outcome of their retrospective proposal on Tuesday.
