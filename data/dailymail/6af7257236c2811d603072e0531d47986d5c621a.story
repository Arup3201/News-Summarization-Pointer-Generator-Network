A heavily pregnant mother who jumped to her death after killing her three children had her pink coffin carried in a horse-drawn carriage to her funeral today.

But Fiona Anderson, 23, who had been suffering from depression, was denied her last wish to be buried with her children because their father refused to allow it.

In a service attended by around 75 people, Fiona's mother Kerry described her as being 'devoted' to Levina, three, Addy, two and 11-month-old Kayden at the ceremony in St Michael's Church, Oulton Broad near Lowestoft, Suffolk.

Service: Ms Anderson was buried with her stillborn child overlooking the plot where her three other children were laid to rest

She also thanked people in the community for helping them through the tragedy.

The rev Robin Pritchard who conducted Miss Anderson's funeral described it as an emotional and difficult day.

'Fiona suffered a profound loss of confidence in herself and in societies’ ability to help her. This has been terrible for everyone. We are shocked, feel guilty and are experiencing a sense of terrible waste.

'Should we condemn Fiona? Not at all.'

Miss Anderson and her unborn daughter Evalie were later laid to rest in the same Lowestoft cemetery where her children were buried last week, but in a separate plot.

Dozens of mourners, many wearing pink in tribute, attended the funeral which was also a memorial service for her children.

Miss Anderson plunged 40ft to her death from a multi-storey car par park in Lowestoft while clutching a teddy bear at 8am on April 15.

Police later found the bodies of her three children in her bed at their basement flat half a mile away.

Miss Anderson had left several messages crawled on her wall including one saying: 'Please bury us together. We want to be together. I need to keep them safe.'

She also left messages on Facebook claiming that her boyfriend Craig McLelland, 24, who was the father of her children, had dumped her for another woman.

Her parents Michael and Kerry Anderson went on ITV Daybreak last month to urge Mr McLelland to have a change of heart after he told them he wanted a separate funeral for his children.

But he refused to back down and the children were buried last week after a service at St Peter and St John church in Kirkley, Lowestoft, Suffolk.

Mr Anderson said: 'It is not just a funeral for Fiona. We want it to be for all five of them. They should never have been broken up. She is overlooking her children. The plot is pretty close.'

He added: 'We decided a horse-drawn hearse would be the best way to spend the money that people have brought together for Fiona. We thought it would be a fitting tribute to everyone.'

It is believed that Miss Anderson stabbed Mr McLelland, causing him a minor injury, during a row in her flat on the night of April 14.

Suffolk Police confirmed that officers briefly spoke to Fiona Anderson hours before her death.

Deaths: Police sealed off this multi-storey car park in Lowestoft after Fiona fell to her death here, which led officers to discover her three children dead at home

CCTV images showed her dropping off the keys to her flat at the Fyffe hostel in Lowestoft where Mr McLelland lives at around 6.20am the following day.

It is thought that she had already killed her children and wanted him to discover the bodies.

Miss Anderson then walked around the streets of Lowestoft, clutching one of her childrens' teddy bears, before she fell from the car park.

An inquest is due to be held.
