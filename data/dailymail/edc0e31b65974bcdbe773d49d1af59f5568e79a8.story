The judge overseeing Casey Kasem’s feuding relatives has revoked an earlier decision ordering doctors to artificially feed and hydrate the ailing American Top 40 host.

Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy determined on Wednesday that giving Kasem food and fluids would be harmful and cause more pain for the 82-year-old former radio and TV personality.

His daughter Kerri Kasem initially implemented the end-of life measures on June 6.

Casey Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean, stormed out of court on Wednesday after a judge revoked an earlier decision ordering doctors to artificially feed and hydrate the ailing American Top 40 host

On Monday, Murphy ordered the reinstatement of feeding and other care while a court-appointed attorney consulted with Casey Kasem and doctors.

Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean Kasem, stormed out of court after Murphy's decision, reports The New York Daily News. ‘You have blood on your hands,’ she said.

Judge Daniel Murphy said he changed his mind after receiving medical records from St. Anthony’s Hospital near Seattle saying the ailing radio host was not responding to artificial nutrition and fluids, leading to painful complications.

'It would be acutely harmful for Mr. Kasem to have nutrition and hydration restored at this time,' the judge said. 'This was at the advisement of doctors at St. Anthony's.'

Daughter Kerri Kasem initially implemented the end-of life measures on her father on June 6

Jean Kasem, 59, told the judge her husband expressed his wish to live using eye and eyebrow movements during a five-minute meeting at the hospital last week.

'They had to pry his hands off me,' she told the judge under penalty of perjury.

He said Jean did not act 'in the best interests' of her sick, 82-year-old husband when she removed him from a 'skilled' California nursing home at 2:30 in the morning May 7 against doctors orders and took him to a private residence in Washington State.

Jean Kasem and her husband’s eldest daughter Kerri have been fighting in courts in Washington state and Los Angeles over his care in recent months.

'We have lived in sheer horror of this girl,' she said, pounding her fist on a courtroom table.

‘(Kerri) has had in her possession her father less than a week and decided to stop all medication and kill him,’ testified Jean.

Kerri’s lawyer Troy Martin vehemently disputed that claim.

'Nobody
 wants Mr. Kasem to die. This is without question the most difficult 
thing I have ever had to do and Kerri has had to do,' Martin told the 
judge on Wednesday.

Jean, the wife of Casey Kasem, spoke with her attorney Steven Haney about the latest developments in the case which sees her at war with Casey's children from his first marriage about his ongoing care

Casey Kasem is now in hospice care. Kerri Kasem released a statement saying the court decision upheld her father’s explicit wishes as expressed by him in his health directive.

'If the extension of my life would result in a mere biological existence, devoid of cognitive function, with no reasonable hope for normal functioning, then I do not desire any form of life sustaining procedures, including nutrition and hydration...'

'Transitioning our father’s treatment to comfort-oriented care was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever had to make,' said Kerri.

'For the last 11 days, our father has 
been surrounded day and night by love and care by his daughters Kerri 
and Julie, his son Mike, his brother Mouner and sister-in-law Mary, and 
his dear friend Gonzalo Venecia. We continue to hope that Jean and 
Liberty will come join his family during this time.'

Kasem
 gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and 
Casey's Top 40. He also was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby 
Doo.
