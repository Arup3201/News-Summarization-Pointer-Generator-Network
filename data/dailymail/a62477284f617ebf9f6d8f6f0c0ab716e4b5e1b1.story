A group of holidaymakers in Ibiza have been fined by police after they were caught having sex in the back of a van.

Police swooped on the Swiss tourists after stopping their van at a roadblock set up to trap drink drivers.

Officers saw the three couples in the throes of passion after they caught a motorist for dangerous driving at the checkpoint in the resort of Playa d'en Bossa.

But instead of fining them for indecency, police fined the tourists £158 (200 euros) each for not wearing seatbelts.

The group ended up paying on the spot once they had dressed so they could benefit from a 50 per cent discount.

A local police spokesman said: 'Having sex in the back of a van isn't against the law but not wearing seatbelts is.

'It's not the first time we've come across people having sex inside a vehicle but we can't recall a case where the vehicle was moving at the time.'

The world's attention has been focused on misbehaving holidaymakers in the Balearics after a British girl was filmed performing a sex act on more than 20 men in a bar.

The sordid session was greeted with disgust around the world after the video was posted by a witness at the event.

Successive investigations found holidaymakers from Britain and also the rest of Northern Europe behaving badly in resorts from Magaluf in Mallorca to San Antonio in Ibiza.

As a result of the bad publicity in Magaluf, police have cracked down on pub crawls, saying that no more than 50 people can attend them.

The bar where the sex act took place has also since been shut down.
