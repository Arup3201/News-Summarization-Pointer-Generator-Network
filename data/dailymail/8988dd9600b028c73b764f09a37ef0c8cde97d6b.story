It is becoming hard to sustain, all this outrage. Every week, new anger. Nought to lunacy in a tweet, a misplaced word, or a thought that hasn’t been properly processed by the standards committee.

Charlie Nicholas could not quickly distinguish between Fernando and Fernandinho of Manchester City in a live update. His apology came fast enough, though.

Terrified at being thought racist, and cowed by the usual nonsense on social media, Sky Sports told senior broadcaster Jeff Stelling to take the lead. He apologised on Nicholas’ behalf, and his colleague offered further words of contrition.

‘Jeff, they both physically look the same and sometimes you don’t catch the number, so you actually don’t quite know what one is what,’ Nicholas said.

It was a decent gesture, at least, but unnecessary. In his error, Nicholas wasn’t saying that all black men look the same to him; he was saying that, at a glance, Fernando and Fernandinho do. And they do, the same way some white footballers look like other white footballers in full flow, the way that, bizarrely, Wayne Rooney must have looked like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain the night Clive Tyldesley momentarily confused them when England played Scotland.

It happens. In the press box after a goal has been scored there will often be questions, uncertainty - about the scorer, the provider, did it take a deflection, who was the last defender. Not because people aren’t paying attention but because a melee of guys challenging for the ball in a small space can be hard to distinguish - and because one player can look like another, black or white.

Nicky Barmby and Craig Hignett were known as The Midget Gems during their time at Middlesbrough.

A comparison between Manchester City's two midfielders - Fernandinho and Fernando

The Brazilian midfielder was unmarked in the six-yard box to flick a header into the bottom corner 

It was a running joke how many times the stadium announcer got their identities mixed up when announcing the scorer’s name. Sometimes, for fun, they would sign as each other for autograph hunters. They marvelled at how infrequently this was picked up, too.

Thomas Gravesen and Lee Carsley were the heart of a hard-working midfield under David Moyes at Everton.

When Gravesen landed a move to Real Madrid it was speculated - only half in jest - that the Spaniards rated him so highly because credit for half of Carsley’s work went his way, too. Racist? Hardly. Two stocky, pale, white guys with shaved heads, powering around the midfield can look like twins; and two black guys, too.

Fernando and Fernandinho have similar skin, similar hair, a similar slender build, play a similar position and wear the same shirt, shorts and socks.

There is a way of telling them apart, beyond the extra syllable, because Fernando is three inches taller - although it is unlikely it will have looked that way on Nicholas’ monitor.

So, given seconds to call the scorer of Manchester City’s goal, he confessed they looked alike to him.

Perhaps he could have chosen his words more wisely but he meant no insult. Jonathan Pearce described the same event for Match of the Day. With 30 years’ experience behind the microphone he waited to give the name of the scorer until he could be absolutely sure.

Nicholas, by contrast, was Arsenal’s centre forward in his previous life; he blundered through like a well-meaning amateur and fell foul of the professionally offended.

The rest is up to us. Do we see sense in these moments and accept an honest mistake, or continue to indulge the ever-present faux-controversy?

Do we steel ourselves for genuine fights against prejudice, or waste time on trivialities? Nicholas did the polite thing by apologising but not the right thing. Sadly, saying sorry only encourages some people.

Sky Sports pundit apologised and said 'physically they look the same'

Some players, whether black or white, do look similar on a football pitch

Nicholas was not being racist and there was no need for an apology

His choice of language could have been better, but it was not racist
