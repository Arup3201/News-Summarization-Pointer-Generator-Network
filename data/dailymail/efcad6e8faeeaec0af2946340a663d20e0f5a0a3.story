It could hardly be a more typical weekend scene: a family stroll for mum, dad, baby and a proud grandmother.

But this is no typical family. Look closer and you'll recognise the smart lady in black as broadcaster and campaigner Dame Esther Rantzen. 

And the smile hides a sadness – as the casually dressed group have come together in circumstances that are more rancorous than relaxed.

For although Dame Esther was delighted when her second grandchild, Teddy, arrived, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that he is the result of an affair and an acrimonious marriage breakdown.

The baby's father is Dame Esther's son, Dr Joshua Wilcox. His partner, Kelly-Ann Jones, a married mother of two, left her husband for Joshua after they had an affair.

The split has reportedly left the deserted husband in a state of devastation.

This might explain why the broadcaster, who was married to the late film-maker and BBC executive Desmond Wilcox, has been rather reticent about the new addition to the family, commenting only briefly to confirm he will be known as Teddy.

Neither parent has been willing to speak in public so far, but a close friend, who knows the details of the marriage break-up, says the pair met when junior doctor Joshua, 34, and Kelly-Ann, 36, began working at Torbay Hospital where she was an Accident and Emergency nurse.

The friend suggests that Kelly-Ann fell pregnant just months into the new relationship.

Joshua and Kelly-Ann now live together with Teddy and her children in a smart penthouse flat in a crescent of period townhouses overlooking the marina in Torquay.

It is understood that the decision was supported by Dame Esther, who has frequently highlighted the anguish suffered by grandparents who are denied access to their grandchildren and then lose touch.

Kelly-Ann was clearly delighted at the pregnancy and proud that her new son bears the Wilcox surname.

Within three days of his birth she posted her new son's photograph on Facebook, writing: 'Our new little bundle, Edward Desmond Rantzen Wilcox 'Teddy'. At a not so little nine pounds nine ounces.' Kelly-Ann's mother, Wendy Bodnar, also posted a picture of the child.

If Dame Esther appears to be in a forgiving mood, it is perhaps understandable as this is not the first time an extra marital affair has featured in her family life.

She was a reporter at the BBC, working alongside Desmond Wilcox's wife Patsy, when she began an affair with Wilcox, who was then her boss. 

Traumatised by her husband's affair, Patsy became so ill she was admitted to Charing Cross Hospital.

Dame Esther moved into the home Patsy had shared with Wilcox to help look after his children.

Patsy refused to divorce Wilcox, only eventually agreeing when, after a number years, Dame Esther became pregnant. She and Wilcox married in 1977 and had three children, Rebecca, Miriam and Joshua. Desmond Wilcox died in 2000.

For one person, however, the events of the past few months have been less than happy. For Neill McArthur, Kelly-Ann's husband and childhood sweetheart, news of her affair came as a shock. His friends say he had believed his marriage was stable until she became increasingly distant. He moved out of the family home last March, assuming he would return home when the pair had settled their differences.

In August, Kelly-Ann agreed to meet him and – accompanied by her mother – told her husband that she was pregnant with Joshua's child.

They had been married since 2001, and a family source said: 'Neill absolutely worshipped Kelly-Ann.

'She wanted nice things in life and he bust a gut to make sure he could provide them.

'It wasn't enough though. Kelly-Ann bored easily and she became tired of Neill. Joshua was the bright new thing and she loves mentioning his surname.

'Neill is now slowly moving on with his life,' says a friend. 'He has met someone new but finds it very difficult to accept another man is living with the woman who is still, technically, his wife and helping to bring up his children.

'But he is glad to be free of her now. Part of him feels people should know just how badly Kelly-Ann has behaved and what she is really like.

'The other part loves his children too much to denigrate their mother so publicly. It has all been incredibly hard for Neill.'
