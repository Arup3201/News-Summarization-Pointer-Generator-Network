Many believe the Shroud of Turin bears the face of Jesus Christ. 

But in the days leading up to Easter, another vision of the Son of God has emerged - this time in condensation on the windscreen of a car parked in Gateshead. 

David Alexander, 39, of Seaton Delaval, Northumberland, was shocked when he looked over and saw the image of Christ appear above the dashboard of his friend's car.

Holy water: David Alexander was transfixed on the face revealed on the windscreen of a car which he says resembled Jesus Christ

Mr Alexander, who works as a support manager for a data marketing analysis firm, said: 'I was sitting in a friend's car on Sunday night. 

'We were about to set off when an image manifested itself on the driver's side of the windscreen.

'I could see a face staring back at me - it looked just like the Turin Shroud - except it looked like Jesus was smiling back at me.

'I pointed it out to my friend and we couldn't believe it.'

Sighting: In the days leading up to Easter another vision of the Son of God emerged. This time in the condensation on a windscreen of a car parked in Gateshead

The image of 'Jesus' was around three inches high and remained on the windscreen for around an hour.

'Maybe there was some holy water in the car', said Mr Alexander. 

'It was very strange. It was a very still night and there was an orange light from the streetlamp shining through the image, making it glow and really stand out.

Holy brew: When Trucluck flipped over the piece of carton, he discovered a white marking which he said looked like the profile picture of Christ

'It was very surreal so I had to take some photographs to prove it. I immediately thought it looked like Jesus.

'Seeing the image hasn't changed my life so far, it hasn't led to a conversion experience, but who knows, maybe it has something to do with Easter approaching.'

Blessed snack: A man shared a photo online of a Cheeto treat which he claimed was shaped like Jesus

Saviour sightings: People have been seeing the face of Jesus in many 
everyday items, including this greeled cheese sandwich which a woman 
sold on eBay for $28,000, left; and a potato chip, right

It is not the first time the Son of God has appeared on items. His image has been seen on rocks, wood, windows and even a tortilla.

In 2011 Sarah Crane, from Orington, was stunned when she hung her laundry out to dry and discovered the face of Jesus staring back at her from a crumpled sock. 

Miss Crane was so impressed she even built a shrine to the sock.

Holy relic: The Turin shroud, which according to Roman Catholic tradition was used to wrap Christ's body before the resurrection

Last month, a devout Christian from the town of Bradenton near Sarasota, came across a piece of beer packaging shaped like a fish - a symbol closely associated with Christianity. 

He took the packaging home because of its religious symbolism but an even bigger surprise awaited.

He discovered an image resembling Jesus on the back of the beer packaging.

A website called stuffthatlookslikejesus.com is dedicated to images of everyday items that have reminded them of the face of Christ.
