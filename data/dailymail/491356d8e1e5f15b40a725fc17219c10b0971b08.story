Zinedine Zidane has revealed he told Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to sign Steven Gerrard in the summer of 2004 - but the Liverpool captain would not leave Anfield.

Zidane wanted the then-England international to partner him in midfield but Gerrard stayed loyal to Liverpool, turning down a move to the Bernabeu on two occasions.

Gerrard announced on Friday he will leave Liverpool at the end of this Barclays Premier League season after a 26-year association, and Zidane has hailed the 34-year-old's dedication.

'I have said in the past that at his peak he was the best in the world,' said Zidane. 

'I think it was the summer of 2004 I was having a conversation with Florentino (Perez) and I told him I wanted him to partner me in midfield for Madrid. 

'I know the club tried twice but he wouldn't leave Liverpool. Not many players turn down Real Madrid but I think that tells you a lot about the loyalty of the man.'

Gerrard went close to his first Premier League title last year as Liverpool finished two points behind champions Manchester City.

He confirmed he will move to America with LA Galaxy, New York City and New York Red Bulls among potential suitors, and Zidane feels it will prove a good move.

'It is incredible he has never won a league title but he has had success with Liverpool,' continued Zidane. 'The years of him winning trophies are not behind him. I am sure he will be very successful in the MLS.'

But Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has made no secret that he wanted to keep Gerrard.

'I think if you look at Steven's statement then that makes it clear,' Rodgers admitted. 'He certainly knew my feelings on me wanting him to be here.

'He has been a brilliant captain for me in my time here. I naturally wanted him to stay here. 

'His role is slightly different now, he still sees himself wanting to go on and play for a couple of years. Naturally at this level it was going to taper over the next couple years. 

'He wasn't ready to go into coaching or anything like that yet. He sees himself very much as a player. When he finishes as a player then we can look at coaching then as he is someone who would be brilliant to come back as part of the staff. But his concentration at the moment is on his football.'
