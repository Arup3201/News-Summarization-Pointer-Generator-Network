Wonga will remove their logo from all of Newcastle United’s replica shirts and training kit for children.

The North East club signed a four-year multi-million-pound deal with the controversial loan company in October 2012 to make them their main sponsor.

It was criticised heavily and striker Papiss Cisse refused to wear the logo on his shirt due to his Muslim faith, though he later reversed his decision.

The logo, which even appears on baby kits, will be removed from children's shirts from 2016-17 onwards

When the deal was struck, Newcastle’s former managing director Derek Llambias said Wonga’s ‘desire to invest in young playing talent’ was key.

But from the start of the 2016-17 season Wonga’s logo will no longer appear on any children’s kit — up to the age of 13.

The move was instigated by new Wonga chairman Andy Haste to ensure children are not influenced by the advertisement.
