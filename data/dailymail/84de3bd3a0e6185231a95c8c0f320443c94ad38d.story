A former Charlie Hebdo  employee has revealed that the satirical French newspaper will be published next week despite the barbaric assassinations of ten of it's journalists yesterday.

Journalist Caroline Fourest, who worked for the paper in 2011, has claimed that the terrorist attack on the publication's Paris offices, which left twelve people dead, will not silence their cartoonists.

Speaking to the ABC, Ms Fourest said past and present employees of the paper will band together to ensure a new edition of Charlie Hebdo will hit newsstands next Wednesday.

Faces of the victims: Among the journalists killed were (l to r) Charlie Hebdo's deputy chief editor  Bernard Maris and cartoonists Georges Wolinski, Jean Cabut, aka Cabu, Stephane Charbonnier, who is also editor-in-chief, and Bernard Verlhac, also known as Tignous

'We have all decided, the journalists who survived and their ex-colleagues, that we are going to have a meeting tomorrow to publish the next Charlie Hebdo, because there is no way, even if they killed 10 of us, that the newspaper won't be out next week,' Ms Fourest said. 

She revealed that the journalists of Charlie Hebdo would often try to play down threats against the paper and laugh about people who were offended by the anti-religious publication.

'All the time when we met we tried to make fun and joke about the crazy stupid people who were violent enough to be afraid of a simple cartoon,' Ms Fourest said. 

'They can continue to be afraid, because there will be more cartoons.

Fourest was working for the publication when it was firebombed after publishing a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad.

After the attack, editor Stéphane Charbonnier said: 'I'd rather die standing than live on my knees'. He was gunned down by the terrorists Wednesday.

Ms Fourest's claims come after a French official close to the case revealed 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad from the north-eastern city of Reims had surrendered to police 'after seeing his name on social media' linked to the crime. He was reportedly arrested at an undisclosed location.

Said Kouachi, 34, and Cherif Kouachi, 32, both from Paris, have also been identified as two of the suspects linked to the deadly terrorist attacked on the newspaper. They are still at large. 

Anti-terrorism officers hunting the terrorists issued photographs of the two brothers describing them as 'armed and dangerous'. 

The terrifying attack occurred on Wednesday morning, after two heavily armed gunmen emerged from a black Citreon car dressed in black balaclavas at 11.20am.

Both men were carrying Kalashnikovs and one of the men was brandishing a rocket-propelled grenade launcher. 

They stormed the offices of the popular newspaper, identifying editor Stephane Charbonnier and gunning him down, along with his bodyguard and three other cartoonists. 

At least four more journalists, who were reportedly involved in a weekly editorial meeting, were also killed by the gunmen. 

Suspects: The three men were named as Cherif Kouachi (left), 32, his brother Said Kouachi (right), 34, and Hamyd Mourad, 18, of Gennevilliers

Response: Police are seen during an operation in the Croix-Rouge suburb of Reims, northern France, early this morning following the attacks

Witnesses have claimed that the men shouted “Allahu akbar!” as they launched the vicious attack on the journalists.  

The terrorists escaped, running down a pedestrian during their getaway. 

They also encountered a police car outside the offices, gunning down the wounded policeman who staggered from the car. 

The men dumped their car about two miles from the Charlie Hebdo offices, making away in a Renault Clio.
