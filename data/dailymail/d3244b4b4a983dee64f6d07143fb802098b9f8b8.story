David Cameron will this week launch a YouTube attack on Ed Miliband and Ed Balls - branding them 'Mystic Ed And His Crystal Balls' for falsely predicting Britain's economic slump would get worse.

Headlined 'Mystic Ed, The World's Worst Clairvoyant,' the internet  cartoon film is designed to convince voters the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor were wrong to denounce the Coalition's 'austerity Britain' policies.

Tory chiefs hope the spoof advertising campaign on the video-sharing website will be widely circulated. Devised by Conservative HQ, its release comes just days before new figures are published this week that are expected to show the economy is continuing to grow. Last week, other figures showed a drop in the number out of work.

But the 'Mystic Ed' video triggered an angry response from Labour. Told of the Tory campaign, a Labour insider said last night: 'Puerile attacks like this are an insult to the millions of people who are struggling to make ends meet.'

It marks the unofficial start of the campaign for the next Election, not due until May 2015, when the economy is likely to be the deciding factor. Mr Cameron is convinced the economic recovery will help him win and that Labour is on the back foot. Labour believes its pledge to freeze energy bills has showed the Tories are vulnerable to claims that they have not curbed the cost of living.

The 'Mystic Ed' film is the  most aggressive Tory publicity attack on Labour since Mr Miliband became Labour leader  in 2010, though not the first time such a campaign has sparked  controversy. In the pre-YouTube 1997 Election, Labour produced posters portraying Tory Prime Minister John Major as 'Mr Dither', based on the Mr Men children's cartoon books, but the idea was vetoed by the series author Roger Hargreaves.

The Tories hit back by producing notorious 'Demon Eyes' posters featuring Tony Blair in an attempt to suggest that, behind his smile, he was a dangerous Left-winger. Mr Blair won by a landslide.

When William Hague succeeded Mr Major, a Labour campaign in the 2001 Election featured Mr Hague with a Margaret Thatcher-style blonde wig superimposed on his bald head - to suggest he shared her outdated views. Mr Hague lost by a landslide.

A Labour poster in the 2010 Election portrayed Mr Cameron as TV detective Gene Hunt, played by actor Philip Glenister in the Life On Mars series, but it backfired spectacularly. It showed Mr Cameron sitting on the bonnet of Hunt's trademark Audi Quattro with the slogan: 'Don't let him take Britain back to the 1980s.' It was intended to link the Tories to the social unrest of that period. But Mr Cameron said he was 'flattered' to be compared to Hunt and adopted the image, replacing the slogan with: 'Fire up the Quattro. It's time for change.'

The Tory YouTube film will feature economic forecasts made by Mr Miliband and Mr Balls and claim that they have repeatedly not been borne out by events. In one comment highlighted by the Tories, Mr Miliband said in October 2010: 'They have a programme which will clearly lead to the disappearance of...a million jobs.'

The video says 1.4 million private sector jobs have been created since 2010. It also refers to a letter to Chief Secretary Danny Alexander from Mr Balls in September, 2010, in which he warned of a 'double dip recession' caused by Government cuts. The film says neither claim turned out to be true.

A Conservative spokesman said: 'Ed Miliband constantly tries to say the country faces disaster under our economic policies - only to be proved wrong time and again. We can make one prediction - if Labour's plan for more spending, borrowing and debt were to be enacted, we really would be in trouble.'
