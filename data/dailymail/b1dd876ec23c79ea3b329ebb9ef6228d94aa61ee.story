Legendary skateboarder Shogo Kubo has died while paddle boarding by himself off the coast of Hawai'i Kai, Honolulu.

Kubo, 54, passed away on Tuesday after witnesses saw him struggling in the water in an area known as 'Seconds' off Portlock Point and people swam out to bring him to the shore, authorities said.

Emergency responders tried to revive him, but he was pronounced dead on the beach, TMZ Sports reported. Authorities are not calling the death suspicious.

Kubo, a married father, was an original member of the Zephyr surf shop's Z-Boys skateboarding team, which was formed in Venice, California in 1975.

Loss: Skateboarding legend Shogo Kubo died on Tuesday after struggling as he went paddle boarding

Kubo and the rest of the Z-Boys team is credited with inspiring a new wave of skateboarders with their tricks, some of which had been taken from surfing

The team is credited with inspiring a new wave of skateboarders with their tricks, some of which had been taken from surfing, the Star Advertiser explained.

The group featured in the 2001 film 'Dogtown and Z-Boys', a documentary made by Stacy Peralta, who was in the original skateboarding team. Peralta won a best director nod at the Sundance Film Festival with the movie.

The documentary was later made into a 2005 Hollywood move, 'Lords of Dogtown,' which starred the late Heath Ledger. Kubo's character was played by skateboarder Don Nguyen.

Jim Muir, the founder of Dogtown Skateboard, told TMZ Sports: 'He was a friend and a brother and he passed away doing what he loved.'

As well as Muir, the other original members included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Paul Constantineau, Peggy Oki, Stacy Peralta, Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV and Allen Sarlo.

Talented: Kubo was part of the Z-Boys team, who were immortalized in a 2001 documentary and credited with inspiring a new wave of skateboarders with their tricks

The team were known for skating in empty swimming pools.

'All that I can say is that with reverence my heart is heavy in the loss of Shogo, a brother with a big heart,' Oki told ESPN.

One of Z-Boys co-founder, Skip Engblom, said when he saw Kubo skate, he knew he wanted him on the team.

'The guys just saw him around and said, "This guy's unreal," and he was in,' Engblom said. "He had a really clean and efficient style, and I think he was really underrated.

'Tony and Jay and Stacy got all the attention, because Shogo wasn't one of those "look at me" guys. He just quietly went about his business of destroying every pool that he found.'

In an interview in 2002, Kubo explained: 'We were aggressive and confident and stood out because we were so 
different, like beach bums.'

After news of his death, tributes and condolences flooded in for the skateboarder.

Engblom said: 'I'm really trying to process the fact that he's gone, because the last time I saw him he was so unbelievably healthy and active. I'm glad he went out doing something he loved doing.'

Younger skaters would think of him as a massive influence, curator of the Morro Bay Skatelab Skateboard Museum Jack Smith said.

In their own tribute, Quicksilver.com added that Kubo was known as 
the 'layback master' whose aerial and sliding skate moves were the basis
 for today's aerial skateboading.
