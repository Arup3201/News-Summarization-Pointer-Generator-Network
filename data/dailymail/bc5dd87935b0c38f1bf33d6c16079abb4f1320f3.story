Gang leader: Amjad Waseem, 29, of Erdington, Birmingham, was sentenced to 54 months in prison

A gang whose £1.25-million supercar scam has echoes of the film Gone In 60 Seconds has been jailed for a total of 12 years.

Four men and a woman have been 
sentenced for their part in the car cloning scam which emulated the 2000
Nicolas Cage movie in which a gang of car thieves target luxury cars for a 
living.

The Birmingham group specifically 
targeted the owners of high-powered vehicles, stealing their ‘dream’ 
cars and selling them on to unsuspecting customers.

The gang was so organised in the 
execution of their plan that officers investigating the thefts even 
found a ‘to do’ list detailing the roles each would play in the 
elaborate con.

Amjad Waseem, 29 , Dean Bott, 44, 
Paula Donnelly, 31, Abdul Nasir Khan, 25, Asmat Masood, 31, were 
sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court last Friday having earlier 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal.

Nabeel Farid, 31 and Heather Downing, 30, both pleaded guilty to the same charges and are due to be sentenced later this month.

All faced charges of conspiracy to steal in connection with the theft of 39 cars.

Asmat Masood, 31 of Alum Rock, was given 36 months in jail

Dean Bott, 44, of Kingstanding, received 24 months in prison

Nabeel Farid, 31, is due to be sentenced later this month

Paula Donnelly, 31, from Selly Oak, got a suspended sentence and community work

Abdul Nasir Khan, 25, of Erdington, was jailed for over 2 years

Heather Downing, 30, is due to be sentenced later this month for her part in the crimes

The vehicles  -which were all 
top-performance cars from across the UK - were cloned using the details 
of similar cars taken from eBay, Piston Heads and Auto Trader websites.

Each was given a false registration and sold on to unsuspecting buyers through the same sites.

In total, the gang stole six Range 
Rover Sport, five Mercedes, seven BMWs, eight Audis, a Porsche 911 
Carerra, two Honda Civics, and a Lexus.

The group of seven also took 
eight Volkswagens, and a Peugeot 207.

Ownership documents were faked, 150 
false identities created and numerous false bank accounts opened by the 
gang in an effort to cover their tracks.

Highly organised, the members also 
made unsuspecting buyers call them on pre-paid mobile phones believing 
that they could not be traced should their scheme be uncovered.

The convictions follow a complex 
investigation launched in 2010 when Waseem, the group’s ringleader, was 
put under a covert police surveillance operation after being arrested 
near to where a stolen car was found.

This was the third occasion he had
been spotted in similar circumstances, rousing the suspicions of 
detectives.

Officers ‘worked around the clock’ to 
monitor his every move, identifying his accomplices and slowly piecing 
together a series of audacious crimes dating back to January 2009 when 
the first car, a BMW 525D M Sport, was stolen.

Thieves took the car from the 
driveway of a house in Great Barr after burglars broke-in and took the 
keys while the family slept.

Three months later, the BMW was 
recovered with a different registration number from an address in 
Hatfield, Herefordshire.

The person who bought the car in good faith had
paid £12,500 to a man in Erdington, Birmingham, unaware that it had been stolen in a
pre-planned and carefully calculated crime.

Detectives also found that the car’s 
vehicle identification number (VIN) - a series of unique security 
markings all cars have - had also been tampered with to put police and 
the buyer off the trail.

As part of their inquiries, police 
sent the vehicle’s log book for an enhanced forensic examination which 
revealed Masood’s fingerprints on the documents.

The net quickly closed and police swooped on the seven one-by-one as the evidence was unearthed.

Each offence always followed the same 
pattern, co-ordinated and overseen by Waseem.

This was later explained 
when officers recovered a ‘to-do’ list from members of the gang which 
carefully set out each stage of the scam with each member playing a 
different role on each occasion.

The addresses used on forged 
documentation and as the location for viewings included those of 
Donnelly and Downing in south Birmingham.

In total 39 cars valued between 
£15,000 and £40,000 - totalling £780,000 - were stolen. Twenty-four of 
the vehicles were recovered by police having been cloned and sold on.

The remaining 15 were found in 
various stages of the complex cloning process ranging from newly stolen 
to 'ready to sell'.

The seven admitted being directly linked to £1.25 
million worth of stolen cars, though some have not been recovered.

Waseem, of Erdington, was sentenced to
54 months, Bott, of Kingstanding, received 24 months, Donnelly, from 
Selly Oak, was handed a six-month sentence suspended for two years and 
200 hours unpaid work.

Khan, of Erdington, was handed 27 months and Masood, of Alum Rock, was given 36 months.

Downing, from Northfield, and Farid, from Erdington, are awaiting sentence.

Inspector Dave Keen, from West 
Midlands Police, said: ‘This was a carefully planned and audacious 
serious of crimes targeting hard working individuals from across the 
country who had saved for a long time to buy the car of their dreams, as
well as those who were looking to own the car of their dreams.

‘Those dreams were shattered by this 
gang who conspired to steal these high performance cars and sell them on
for their own criminal gain.

‘All of those involved have now been 
brought to justice thanks to the dedication of West Midlands Police 
officers and the wider criminal justice system.

‘The case also serves as a stark 
reminder of the dangers of buying second hand cars through private 
sellers without prior research and without conducting full checks 
through a variety of official websites.'

The five were sentenced on Friday 
10 August with two to be sentenced later this month.

All seven are 
subject of ongoing Proceeds of Crime Act investigations with 
officers looking to seize any assets obtained through criminal 
activities.

All of the cars were returned to their rightful owners or their insurers.
