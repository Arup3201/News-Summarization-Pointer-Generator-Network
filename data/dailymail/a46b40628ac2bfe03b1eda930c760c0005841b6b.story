The wait for fast food restaurant drive thrus is now longer than ever.

Thanks to complicated new concoctions sold at major chains nationwide for increasingly discerning consumers, a study out today says wait times are now at all-time highs.

And at its slowest in 15 years is drive-thru giant McDonalds, where customers must wait an average of 9 seconds longer than most fast food joints.

Finally: Wait times at American fast food chain drive thrus are now at record highs

Fast food industry publication QSR released its 15th annual analysis of drive thru speeds at nationwide chains. Below are the chains and the average time it takes to be served from order to pickup.

Krystal................3.6 mins

Chik-fil-A............3.4 mins

Burger King........3.3 mins

McDonald's........3.16 mins

Taco John's........3.0 mins

Taco Bell............2.6 mins

Wendy's.............2.2 mins

According to the 2013 Drive-Thru Performance Study conducted for industry magazine QSR, McDonalds customers who don’t want to get out of the car for a bite to eat wait an average of 3.16 minutes between ordering and picking up their food.

Not a long wait, of course, but the longest in the history of the study. And it all comes down to menu bloat.

That’s what the industry calls the newer, more complicated offerings that have been the trend industry-wide as companies try to out compete each other for market share.

‘The operational pressures to assemble those items are slowing down the drive-thru,’ QSR editor Sam Oches told USA Today.

Though, the wait isn’t all bad.

QSR writes that, in addition to increased complexity of their offerings, fast food chains have also upped the ante on quality of service.

‘The one thing that angers a customer most is to not get the right food,’ Oches said. ‘It's possible to be too fast.’

According to the study, accuracy may sometimes trump speed in the race to win over fast food customers.

‘We knew going into this year’s Study that speed-of-service times seemed to have plateaued over the last few years, but we did not really expect to see the nearly across-the-board increases in service times that were apparent,’ Brian Baker, president of Insula Research, told QSR.

‘Customers will be patient if you give them hot, accurate orders,’ says Oches.

'Menu bloat': The study looked at how quickly food was served from order to pickup and found increased wait times across the board thanks to more complex menus than ever and more focus on accuracy
