Nick Kyrgios' time may come at Wimbledon but it won't be this year after big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic ended his dream run this morning.

The Australian teenager was unable to reproduce the heroics of his sensational upset over world No.1 Rafael Nadal in a 6-7 (7-4) 6-2 6-4 7-6 (7-4) quarter-final loss to eighth seed Raonic.

Kyrgios, 19, admitted fatigue played a part but he also got a taste of his own medicine as his 23-year-old opponent turned in a spectacular display of serving.

Not happy: Raonic speaks with the umpire while sitting in his chair during the quarter-final match

The 144th-ranked wildcard missed a chance to set up a semi-final against his idol Roger Federer.

However he will depart the All England Club with a top 70 ranking and having announced his arrival as arguably the world's most exciting young player.

'It's been the best couple of weeks of my life,' said Kyrgios, the first man to reach the last eight at Wimbledon on debut in a decade.

'Never did I think that I was ever going to make quarter-finals of Wimbledon and beat Nadal on Centre Court. It's all happened pretty fast.'

With Kyrgios still adjusting to the rigours of the men's tour, there were doubts as to how he would back up emotionally and physically from Wednesday's staggering four-set upset of Nadal on Centre Court.

Explosive: Cilic was in supreme serving form on Wednesday evening

Kyrgios said he would depart the tournament proud, confident and having received a priceless lesson in what he needs to do to go even deeper in the future - or one day win it.

'It's been a special week for me but at the same time, it's been so exhausting,' Kyrgios said.

'I've got nothing left to give. That's what grand slams do to you.

'If I was to go further, I'm going to have to get stronger. I'm going to have to get so much better in so many areas.'

Raonic, possessing what many consider the world's best serve, belted 39 aces to 15 in a relentless display that had Kyrgios shaking his in disbelief at times.

Power: The Australian teenager unleashes a forehand during an impressive first set

Salute: Kyrgios looked to be on top early on, building on the form he showed against Rafael Nadal

At one stage, Raonic did not drop a point for nine straight service games.

'He served unbelievably,' said Kyrgios, who was similarly-impressive on serve against Nadal.

'He was in such a rhythm that I just couldn't do anything out there.'

While Kyrgios couldn't find the level he produced against Nadal, his serve dug him out of some tricky spots in the first set before he edged a tense tiebreak to take a significant step towards the semi-finals.

He was at his flamboyant best early in the second set, producing one staggering cross-court winner at full stretch.

But he went alarmingly off the boil, dropping serve twice as Raonic raced through the second set.

Kyrgios responded, breaking Raonic early in the third set but it proved a false dawn for the Australian.

The Canadian broke twice to regain the ascendancy and closed to within a set of victory.

It looked like Raonic would run away with it but, as he has all tournament, Kyrgios fought gamely.

He forced a tiebreak and saved three match points before Raonic finally put an end to an unforgettable match - and Australian involvement in the singles draw.

Ranked outside the top 800 at the start of last year, former top-ranked junior Kyrgios' ranking will shoot up to around world No.65 on the back of a run that also featured a second-round upset of French 13th seed Richard Gasquet, in which he saved nine match points.
