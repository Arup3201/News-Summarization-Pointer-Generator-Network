With their long manes shinning and shimmering in the wind, the Oregon Wonder Horses have a magical look similar to that of children's toy My Little Pony.

The mystical creatures, who were popular in circuses, even slept with their long locks in plaits to stop them getting tangled.

Despite the legends that the Oregon 
Wonder Horses had been captured from a legendary wild herd, they appear 
to have been bred from draft horses, possibly with Andalusian as well.

Mystique: With their long manes shinning and shimmering in the wind, the Oregon Wonder Horses have a magical look similar to that of children's toy My Little Pony

Famous: Due top the wonderful growth of hair, Linus has been facetiously dubbed the Sampson of equine

Growing: After they were bred primarily in captivity, the growth of their hair increased with each generation

Similarity: Children's toy My Little Pony

The wonder horses were known for their rich chestnut color and, more importantly, the amazing length of their manes and tails.

After they were bred primarily in captivity, the growth of their hair increased with each generation.

Their excessively long manes and tails 
would have been a severe hindrance in the wild and needed a lot of care 
in a domestic situation.

One of the earliest long-maned horses
 was a Percheron named Prince Imperial who also laid claim to the 
world's longest mane.

Prince Imperial originally belonged to Emperor 
Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte III (nephew of the famous Napoleon).

In 1869, a Marion livestock breeder named Jacob Howser traveled to France and bought the horse for $3,000.

Howser exhibited Prince Imperial at 
fairs and horse shows around the USA and billed him as 'The Greatest 
Living Curiosity of This or Any Other Age.'

Tales of wonder: Circuses and sideshows often invented exotic stories about their exhibits

High maintenance: Excessively long manes and tails would have been a severe hindrance in the wild and needed a lot of care in a domestic situation

Prince Imperial was credited with having the longest forelock (at 7 ft) and longest mane (at 9 ft 10 inches) in the world, the mane later being described as 14 ft 3 inches at its longest.

He weighed 1840 pounds and is believed to have been one of the first Percherons imported into the USA.

When not being exhibited, his mane was braided and the braids looped to stop the hair dragging on the ground.

Prince Imperial died in 1888, but continue to be a curiosity and money-spinner for his owner. Professor AG Ward stuffed the horse so that Howser could continue exhibiting him.

Care: When not being exhibited, their man was braided and the braids looped to stop the hair dragging on the ground

Record: One of the earliest long-maned horses was a Percheron named Prince Imperial (not pictured) who also laid claim to the world's longest mane

Outside of the sideshow travelling season, the stuffed horse was kept in Howser's living room.

After Jacob Howser died, his sons continued to exhibited Prince Imperial.

This tradition continued to the next generation, with Jacob Howser's grandsons and great-grandson Jake Howser doing the same.

Great-gradson Jake Howser tried to end the tradition and instructed his sons to burn the stuffed horse when Jake died.

Display: Even after the horse died they were still considered so interesting that a taxidermy specimen was exhibited

Show stopper: Called Linus this wondrous horse was taken around fairs, show-grounds and museums for many years, showing off her glorious long mane and general good looks

The Wonder Horses of Oregon are remarkable for the great growth of hair in mane and tail, which for length and thickness is not equaled in the world

Luckily for sideshow historians, Prince Imperial was sold to another local family.

They cleaned him up and put him on a wheeled platform which they dragged through local parades. He later became the property of Theodore Myers, associate director of the Marion campus of Ohio State University and member of the board of the local historical society.

Myers kept Prince Imperial in a travelling case in his barn.Â 

Prince Imperial eventually became the 
property of the Marion County Historical Society and continues to enjoy a
 degree of posthumous fame as a static exhibit in Marion, Ohio. at the 
Heritage Hall.
