Kate Middleton may get the most royal media attention, but there's another royal who is set to take the world by storm - Maria-Olympia of Greece.

The 18-year-old, whose parents are Crown Princess Marie-Chantal and Crown Prince Pavlos, is quickly becoming the new royal 'It' girl, thanks to her mother's Instagram page, where she proudly posts pictures of Olympia and her brothers.

Olympia was featured in this month's issue of W, where she struck a pose in a series of haute couture ensembles for the magazine's 'New Royals' spread.

Olympia, who studies drama, history of art, graphics and photography in London, is quickly making her mark on the city's social scene; she was even featured on the cover of Tatler in February.

She was photographed close-up and in black and white for the cover image of the issue, which bore the headline: Teen Princess - Olympia of Greece: The Most Eligible Girl in the World.

Born in New York and raised in London, she is the eldest of five children and the only girl of the bunch.

She lives with her parents and her brothers - 15-year-old Prince Constantine-Alexios, 13-year-old Prince Achileas-Andreas, nine-year-old Prince Odysseas-Kimon, and five-year-old Prince Aristidis-Stavros.

The Italian fashion designer, who designed the gown Marie-Chantal wore for her wedding in 1995, is just one of the famous figures this royal clan has befriended.

In July, the Crown Princess and her daughter attended Valentino's runway show at Paris Fashion Week, where Olympia was seated on the front row next to Emma Watson.

In another photo, she and her mother wear matching black lace dresses as they pose for the camera, their hair equally glossy and blonde.

The family, who have a house in London and in Gloucestershire, spend their summers in Harbour Island, Bahamas, and their winters in Gstaad, Switzerland - where Prince Pavlos proposed to Marie-Chantal on a chair lift in 1994.

In December 2012, Olympia shared a glimpse at her skiing holiday in the mountain town, where she rode on a sled with her cousin Talita von Furstenberg, 15, whose grandmother is designer Diane von Furstenberg.

Talita's mother is Alexandra von Furstenberg - Marie-Chantal's younger sister, who works as the image director for clothing label DvF.

Alexandra, Marie-Chantal and their older sister Pia - often referred to as 'The Miller Sisters' - all married into very wealthy families; Pia's ex-husband is Getty Oil heir Christopher Ronald Getty. 

Marie-Chantal has a long history of associating with the rich and famous; before she married into the royal family, the London-born blonde - whose father was duty-free shopping co-founder Robert Warren Miller - worked for Andy Warhol.

In June, she shared a picture of herself with the late great artist, captioning the photo: 'Found this in a box of photos. Andy Warhol and me 1986 #andywarhol #mariechantal'. 

Born in London, she was raised in Hong Kong until the age of nine, went she went to boarding school in Switzerland.

Marie-Chantal began a degree in History of Art at NYU in 1993, but she dropped out after Prince Pavlos proposed to her the following year.

The couple met on a blind date set up by New York investment banker Alecko Papamarkou, a mutual friend who was convinced they would hit it off.

'We clicked,' the Princess told Vanity Fair in 2008. 'It was love at first sight. I knew that he was the person I would marry.'

High-class hobbies: Their lifestyle couldn't be more royal; Marie-Chantal recently shared a photo of her daughter snuggling up to a horse

Passions: Olympia studies drama, history of art, graphics and photography in London

Growing up: She celebrated her 18th birthday this year, which means she'll start college next year

Their wedding was the largest gathering of royals in London since Queen Elizabeth's wedding to Prince Philip in 1946.

Among those who attended were the royal families of Britain, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, Romania, Jordan and Bulgaria. 

The couple moved to Manhattan, where they had Olympia, before moving to London in 2002 so their children could have a European education.

These days, Marie-Chantal runs her own eponymous children's clothing label, which is stocked in boutiques and stores worldwide.

Even though Greece hasn't officially been a monarchy since the Seventies, Marie-Chantal and her husband are still known as Their Royal Highnesses the Crown Prince and Crown Princess - and their children, too, are given these titles.

And their lifestyle couldn't be more royal; in May, Marie-Chantal shared a photo of her daughter perched on a grand staircase in a bright pink tutu-inspired gown, looking every inch the modern princess.

Another photo shows the teen cuddling up to a horse in a stable, her nose touching the animal's lovingly. 

Downtime: Judging by her Instagram, Olympia spends a lot of time holidaying in tropical locations - like Ibiza, Spain (pictured), where she celebrated her birthday in July
