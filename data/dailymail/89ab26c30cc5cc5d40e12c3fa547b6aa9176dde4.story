Wayne Rooney insists England are slowly rebuilding their international credibility after a disastrous World Cup and that opponents will be wary of them despite their failure in Brazil.

England have won seven straight games since the 0-0 draw against Costa Rica, but they face a tough test in Turin on Tuesday when they take on Italy, who beat them in Brazil.

The England captain insists that the team is making progress under Roy Hodgson, even though the victories have been recorded against less exacting opposition.

Rooney said: ‘After the World Cup we spoke and knew it would take time but we are gradually getting better. 

'You are seeing the results on the pitch but there is still a long way to go. I’m not saying we are happy with this level. We will still need to improve before hopefully getting to France in 2016 but there is time to improve.

‘I think, looking at the team we have got, when we lose the ball we go and win it back quickly. What we have been working on is pressing as a team from the back.

‘There are times when we have to tuck in as a team and then hit teams on the break and we have so much pace in the team, which players don’t like playing against.

‘Teams will be a bit wary about that when they play us because of the pace and ability we have.

‘I am one of the older guys in the dressing room and I have responsibility that I am enjoying as captain and with the experience I have I hope to pass that on,’ he added.

Rooney admitted he is excited at the prospect of becoming England's all-time top scorer

Rooney has scored 47 goals for England and Sir Bobby Charlton holds the record with 49

After scoring against Lithuania, Rooney is two goals short of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time goalscoring record for the national team.

And he admits he thinks about becoming England’s all-time top scorer.

‘It is always at the back of my mind, there is no getting away from it. It could be on Tuesday, it could be in the summer, or it could be after that,’ he said.
