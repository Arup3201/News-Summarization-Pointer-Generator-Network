England might have delighted the Wembley crowd with their 3-0 win against Peru on Friday  - but it was one of the fans who got the biggest cheer of the night.

Blair Valentine, from Greenwich, South London, was one of many in the stands who found a novel way of enjoying himself, by throwing paper aeroplanes.

A YouTube video shows the moment Mr Valentine launched his paper craft in the 82nd minute of the friendly at Wembley.

Peru's Hansell Riojas is hit by a paper aeroplane thrown by fans at Wembley

The
 footage captures the flight of the plane as it soars from the top tier 
of the stadium, above the crowds before it strikes Peru’s Hansell Riojas
 on the head to the delight and amazement of onlookers.

The craft was cheered on by supporters as 
they saw the aeroplane wing its way down from high up in the stands and gather 
speed as it flew towards the playing area.

The
 
brilliantly-captured incident brought about huge roars from the crowd, 
but fortunately the craft offered no danger to the defender who 
walked away unscathed.

The planes were made out of pieces of card handed to the crowd to hold up to make the giant crosses of St George during the national anthem.

Mr Valentine outed himself as the 'mystery airplane bandit' on his Twitter feed shortly after, where he also shared pictures of the moment the plane sailed 100 yards effortlessly.

The YouTube video of the incident, uploaded by Heather Elizabeth, has been viewed more than  1.4million times.
