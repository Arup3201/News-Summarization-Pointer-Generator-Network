Fringe player: Sylla made just five Premier League starts for Paul Lambert's side last season

Sylla, 23, has made 24 appearances in all competitions for Villa since joining them in January 2013 from French outfit Clermont Foot on a three-and-a-half-year deal.

Last term he started just five Barclays Premier League games and in April he was quoted as saying he was looking for a summer loan move due his unhappiness at spending so much time on the bench.
