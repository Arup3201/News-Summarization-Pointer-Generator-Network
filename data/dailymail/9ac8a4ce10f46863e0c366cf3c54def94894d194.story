Jailed: Emily Fox, 26, is one of dozens of teachers to have had relationships with pupils in the last year

At least two teachers are banned from classrooms every month over ‘inappropriate relationships’ with pupils, figures reveal.

A total of 28 were expelled from the profession last year after misconduct proceedings over their disgraceful behaviour towards youngsters.

The figure can be revealed days after a lesbian PE teacher at a leading private school was jailed for 15 months for having sex with one of her pupils.

Emily Fox, 26, who taught at the Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, exchanged hundreds of sexually explicit messages with the 15-year-old girl.

They struck up a friendship which developed into an ‘intense’ bond that involved kissing and later sexual touching, a court heard.

Now, after a Freedom of Information request from the Daily Mail, the Department for Education has released figures showing the scale of the problem of teachers who lust after pupils.

They reveal that 28 members of the profession were banned last year after disciplinary proceedings were brought by the National College for Teaching and Leadership over alleged inappropriate relationships with pupils.

A further five teachers kept their jobs after facing misconduct hearings over the same issue.

The DfE said it could not provide corresponding figures for previous years from the General Teaching Council, which had responsibility for disciplining teachers before the National College for Teaching and Leadership was set up.

The revelations follow a string of high-profile cases involving teachers who tried to forge inappropriate relationships with pupils.

In June last year, married maths teacher Jeremy Forrest was jailed for five-and-a-half years for child abduction and sexual activity with a child, after a case which hit the headlines here and abroad.

Forrest, 30, prompted an international manhunt when he ran away to France with a 15-year-old female pupil.

Their relationship began after the teenager developed a crush on him at Bishop Bell Church of England School in Eastbourne, East Sussex.

Over four months they had sex in his car, at his home and at hotels, often without contraception, before Forrest took the teenager abroad.

His victim, now 16, had vowed to stand by him but has since been reported to have found a partner nearer her own age.

In July, Andrew Eades, 25, was banned from the country’s classrooms for life after setting up a mobile phone to record in a toilet at Kingsthorpe Community College in Northampton.

Another case involved a teacher at a Preston school who sent Facebook messages to pupils asking about their sex lives. Stephen Griffiths, 36, was banned from teaching for at least two years after a panel found he was guilty of unacceptable conduct while employed at Fulwood Academy.

A 49-year-old married woman teacher who sent inappropriate messages to a boy pupil at her school was also kicked out of the profession. Yvonne Preston, who taught at Castle Hall School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, sent him cards containing phrases such as ‘you light up my world like nobody else’ and ‘just being with you breaks my heart’.

She was barred from teaching until at least July 2016, when she can apply to have the ban lifted.

London maths teacher Nkosana Brown, 33, who sent messages to a pupil sending her ‘kisses all over your body’, was banned for a minimum of five years.
