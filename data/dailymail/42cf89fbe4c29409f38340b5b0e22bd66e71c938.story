When it comes to romance, everyone has insecurities but it turns out that even models have doubts when it comes to the dating scene.

Model and singer Nadia Forde, 25, has admitted that she has her flaws of her own but says she is on the hunt for a man who is willing to embrace them.

Nadia, who recently featured in I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here, describes herself as being impatient and a bit of a chatterbox.

Irish model and singer Nadia Forde admits that she has many imperfections including being too chatty

However rather than trying to adjust her personality Nadia says that she wants someone who will take her for who she is and equally she isn't looking for perfection. 

'I'm definitely on the lookout for my Imperfect Gentleman - we all try to put on a 'perfect' front for a new partner but actually, it's when the walls have come down and I've been my true self that I've fallen in love.

'Everybody has their own imperfections and we should embrace these. These are the things - whether it's a loud laugh or someone with two left feet - that are endearing, and you come to love.'

The 25-year-old says that she is not looking for perfection in a man and wants someone who will love her for who she is and embrace her flaws

3. Sensitive (36 per cent)

4. Stubborn (30 per cent)

7. Falling in love too easily (22 per cent)

8. Being too critical (18 per cent)

9. Prone to moaning (18 per cent)

10. Being jealous (17 per cent) 

Despite many wanting to hide their flaws, 85 per cent of singletons say they'd find their date more attractive if they didn't put on a front and instead were comfortable with their own imperfections.

And an overwhelming 94 per cent of singles believe imperfections are charming, according to the research by dating website match.com.

The survey of 1,753 single Brits found being shy (51 per cent) was the most common imperfection, followed by being insecure (40 per cent) and being too sensitive (36 per cent).

Kate Taylor, relationship expert for match.com, says that all too many singletons attempt to alter their behaviour in their quest for love. 

'In the run up to Valentine's Day people can often put pressure on themselves to put on a 'perfect' front and rush to find a date.

'But actually, you find that potential partners often find these little traits endearing and will be far more attracted to you when you're comfortable in your own skin and love your imperfections.'
