Jeremy Menez may have fired eight goals in 14 starts for AC Milan, but the France international is seeking inspiration from the very best strikers in Italian football to improve his game.

The 27-year-old is using Roma's Francesco Totti and his coach Filippo Inzaghi to learn how to become even more clinical in front of goal.

Menez told Corriere dello Sport: 'I would like to do as he (Inzaghi) did, every day I try. I want to improve my instincts in the box, too.

'I know Totti well. For me, he is an example. He is a great player like few I’ve seen in my career.' 

Milan are currently seventh in Serie A but trail third-placed Napoli  by only two points.

Menez believes a top four finish in Serie A is obtainable, but that the title challenge itself will be played out between the top two of Roma and Juventus.

'I came here to make sure that Milan return to the top of international football,' Menez said.
