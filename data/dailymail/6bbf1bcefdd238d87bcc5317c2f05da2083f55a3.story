A teen pageant queen has allegedly been stripped of her title after an adult video of her emerged online.

Kristy Althaus came second in Colorado's Miss Teen USA competition, but shortly after a porn clip said to be starring the pageant runner-up began to spread, it appears the judges changed their minds.

A video from the pageant shows a smiling Miss Althaus in a plunging red dress holding hands with the 2012 winner Jacqueline Zuccherino as the results are announced.

Two years later, a different image is put across, as a clip showing a young woman with a striking resemblance to Kristy Althaus in compromising positions on a bed emerges on an adult entertainment website.

The clip starts with the woman on a bed as a man off-camera asks her how old she is, to which she replies: 'I'm 18,' Gawker reports.

The man asks her: 'And this is definitely your first adult video?'

And the girl replies: 'Yes, it is.'

According to Gawker, the video was filmed just weeks ago and published on January 24.Â 

Stripped: Miss Althaus, (pictured in red holding hands with winner Jacqueline Zuccherino), has deleted her Twitter account since the video emerged

When Gawker began to inquire into the video, Miss Althaus quickly deleted her Twitter account.

Future Productions, which produces the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA state pageant, removed Miss Althaus' name from the Official Results 2012 page, as well as a video showing the moment when the results are called out during the 2012 pageant.

As of Thursday morning, the entire 2012 results page was removed from the Miss Colorado website.

Last year, Miss Delaware Teen USA 2012, gave up her crown after a porn video produced by the same outfit as the film allegedly portraying Miss Althaus surfaced.

Melissa King was forced to admit that she had recorded the porn video before she won the pageant, after a clip emerged of her stating her name to the camera.
