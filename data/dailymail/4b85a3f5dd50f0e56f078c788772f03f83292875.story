Former Ashes-winning captain Mike Gatting looks likely to be the best-known casualty of a remarkable ageism purge taking place at the England Cricket Board.

Gatting, highly-respected managing director of cricket partnerships, is expected to be offered a low-key ambassador role after radical changes are recommended at a board meeting today.

Gatting’s demise follows the recent departure of chief executive David Collier, commercial director John Perera and HR director Lesley Cook — all of whom are in their late 50s or 60.

Mike Gatting is highly-respected in his ECB role but will be asked to take a lower level job to make way for a younger generation of administrators

And other members of ECB staff in that age bracket feel similarly threatened by the more youthful revolution being carried out by Yorkshire’s Colin Graves in advance of him becoming chairman of ECB and Tom Harrison arriving at Lord’s as the new chief executive. 

Gatting said: ‘Changes are being made, but I don’t know what they’ll be. I’m waiting to find out.’

Collier’s surprise departure last summer is understood to be connected with him finding it very difficult to work with Graves, who wants to build a new much more county-focused ECB regime around the new CEO, commercial chief Sanjay Patel and ultra-political chief operating officer Gordon Hollins, who has carried out the major staff review.

Supermarket chain tycoon Graves, whose ascendancy will mean current chairman Giles Clarke concentrates on ICC business in a likely new role as ECB President, has the strong support of two powerful county chairmen in Surrey’s Richard Thompson and Somerset’s Andy Nash.

Ironically, the executives leaving the ECB are younger than first-class umpires Peter Willey and George Sharp who are taking their aegism case to an employment tribunal after being retired against their wishes at the age of 65.

The FA were absent from Sports Personality of the Year in Glasgow despite the fact the England manager is usually interviewed. 

And even after the World Cup debacle, a chat with a croaking Gary Lineker could still have been relatively upbeat after England’s 100 per cent start to their Euro 2016 campaign. However, Roy Hodgson and all the Wembley top brass were ‘unavailable’.

England's dismal World Cup showing meant that the national football team were not on the SPOTY agenda

But Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan, linked with succeeding departing FA chief Alex Horne, did attend as well as Scotland boss Gordon Strachan.

British golf’s high command from the R&A, European Tour and Ryder Cup had travelled to Scotland in anticipation of double-major winner Rory McIlroy being named Sports Personality of the Year.

But they were remarkably sanguine after Lewis Hamilton’s victory that exposes the total inadequacy of a public vote shoehorned into 35 minutes on the night when F1’s social media dominance over golf became so apparent.

World champion Lewis Hamilton, Britain’s richest sportsman as well as BBC Sports Personality of the Year, is understood to have granted Ari Emanuel’s Hollywood entertainment agency William Morris Endeavor a trial period to represent him to see what they can do for his benefit. 

WME, who bought IMG earlier this year for $2.4billion, used to look after Hamilton’s girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.

Gill’s FIFA plans begin

David Gill, who is standing as the England candidate for the British vice-presidency on the FIFA ExCo, is starting to distance himself from the Premier League and the possible conflicts that would bring in Zurich. He is to step down from the PL’s audit and remuneration committee.

Meanwhile, the PL will have to change their statutes to accommodate CEO Richard Scudamore becoming executive chairman, which is currently the favourite option. Article 42 states the chairman must be independent and FA approved, which won’t help Scudamore’s cause.

Chelsea are promoting themselves as the first Premier League club to be accredited for paying all staff, and sub-contractors, the minimum £9.15-an-hour London living wage. 

Chelsea may be comfortable with life on the pitch at the moment, but they have upset some security personell

This coincides with them outsourcing their security operation to specialists ISS FS security. It has upset some long-term Chelsea security personnel who have lost their club connection while three chiefs, Keith Overstall, Ed Ashwell and John Cottam, remain on the club payroll. 

Chelsea say the move is for best security and the three bosses have a wider remit.
