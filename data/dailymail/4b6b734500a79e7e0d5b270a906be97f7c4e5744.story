The Foreign Office has spent more than £450,000 on media training for ministers, ambassadors and mandarins to look good on TV, it can be revealed.

Almost 700 officials working for the government around the world have been given taxpayer-funded lessons in dealing with the media since 2010.

Critics condemned the ‘absurd’ waste by Foreign Secretary William Hague's department at a time of deep spending cuts across Whitehall.

William Hague's Foreign Office has spent £450,000 on media training since 2010, although the Foreign Secretary himself has no trouble with appearing in front of the cameras

While the amount spent each year has fallen since 2010, the cost per person has risen to an average of £677.92 per person, up 22 per cent on 2012

Figures released under Freedom of Information shows that in the last four years the Foreign Office has spent £451,573 on media training.

The taxpayer has paid to hire firms which have previously worked for food manufacturers Kraft, mobile firm Orange and fashion house Chanel.

It includes a course for ambassadors in ‘Strategic Media Skills and Techniques’ and another for press officers called ‘International Communication Skills’.

The Foreign Office insists its most senior staff around the world need to know how to deal with the media.

But with government departments facing at least two more years of cuts, Labour condemned the ‘vanity spending’.

In 2013 alone, 146 people were trained at a cost of £98,977 - an average of £677.92 per person, up 22 per cent on 2012.

It has previously emerged that Energy Secretary Ed Davey has received taxpayer-funded media training twice

In July last year, an unnamed minister at the Foreign Office received media training costing £1,150  from Robert Taylor Communications, which promises  to help ‘spokespeople to speak with confidence, authority and effect in TV and radio interviews, press conferences and more’.

Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘While families are suffering a cost-of-living crisis Ministers are spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer pounds trying to sell their flawed policies.

‘Instead of wasting money to help them sell bad news Ministers should focus on how to earn our way to higher living standards.

‘To many this will look like vanity spending. Is there no end to this Whitehall waste?’

The prestigious Strategic Media Skills and Techniques is offered to Ambassadors and Deputy Heads of Mission – the senior representatives of HMG overseas - to ‘give them the skills they need to act as the senior spokesperson for HMG in their country’. It has been provided by Group K Broadcasting Ltd, which promises help in how to ‘handle the Media and Press confidently, effectively and convincingly’ and has worked for Chanel, Kodak, Goldman Sachs and Kraft Foods.

The International Communication Skills course is ‘aimed at members working in our communications teams overseas and in the UK, and it covers the basic skills needed to work as a press or campaigns officer, in an international context, and overseas’.

It is provided by Caroline Black Associates, which has also advised the Premier League, British Red Cross and Transport for London.

Robert Oxley, Campaign Director of TaxPayers' Alliance said: ‘It's absurd that the Foreign Office is wasting taxpayers' money teaching staff to spin the media. Whitehall needs to cut out waste, not squander cash on making ministers and mandarins look better on TV.’

But the Foreign Office said: ‘It is important that HMG’s workforce receives the right training to carry out their duties.

‘Being skilled in a range of communications techniques, including working with the media is essential to explain and promote British prosperity, security and the interests and welfare of UK nationals across the world.’

In October 2012, MailOnline revealed how eight government departments had spent thousands of pounds on training for at least 19 ministers.

Business ministers Matthew Hancock and Jo Swinson are among the latest crop of ministers to receive media training

But new details have emerged revealing that another six ministers, including high fliers like Tory Matthew Hanock and Lib Dem Jo Swinson, have been sent on courses in how to smile for the camera, deliver soundbites and dodge tricky questions from journalists.

Transport ministers Baroness Kramer and Robert Goodwill were trained by Angela Coles last year, a cost of £1,907.40.

At the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Matthew Hancock, Jo Swinson and Viscount Younger all received media training from Millbankmedia at a total cost of £7,700.

The Department of Health spent £500 on media training for minister Earl Howe.

The figures are in addition to companies previously hired by the government tell politicians how media interviews are ‘a mixture of opportunity and danger’.

One Cabinet minister - Energy Secretary Ed Davey - has been sent on media training twice.

In June 2010 when a minister at the Department for Business, Innovation and Climate Change Mr Davey had £700 worth of media training.

Then in July 2012, the Department for Energy and Climate Change spent another £2,160 on extra training for Mr Davey with private firm Electric Airwaves, which has previously worked with the Disney empire.
