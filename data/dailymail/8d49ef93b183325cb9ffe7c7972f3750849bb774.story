Mitt Romney is winning the White House race among Americans who have already voted, according to a new poll released last night.

The Republican challenger has opened up a seven point lead among the 15 per cent who have cast their votes early.

Pollster Gallup says Mr Romney has more ballots in the bank than President Obama by a margin of 52 per cent to 45 per cent.

As many as a third of Americans are likely to go to the polls before Election Day on November 6.

Gallup still has the two candidates in a dead heat at 49 per cent among likely voters as the race enters its final week.

With Hurricane Sandy throwing both men’s campaigns into chaos, the early voters could prove to be even more crucial in the final outcome than in previous years.

Mr Obama and Mr Romney both called off rallies yesterday as the storm bore down on America’s East Coast.

The president cancelled a planned 
appearance in Orlando, Florida to return to Washington and monitor the 
weather crisis. He also shelved a trip to Green Bay, Wisconsin scheduled
for Tuesday.

Mr Obama received a briefing from his top emergency advisers, his second in as
many days. He addressed reporters at the White House, warning that 
recovery from the giant storm would not be swift.

Obama expressed concern over the storm's effect on the economy, and the 
disruptions in New York's financial district were bound to be among 
those that preoccupied the administration Tuesday.

Storm damage was projected at $10billion to $20billion, making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.

Mr Romney 
followed suit, pulling out of all campaigning yesterday evening and 
throughout Tuesday, along with his running mate Paul Ryan.

Damage from the storm is projected at around £12billion and Mr Obama has declared it a 'major disaster'.

But neither rival could afford to 
totally shut down operations. The political barbs continued in campaign 
ads and between aides trying to show the upper hand in a race as tight 
as ever.

At a White House 
press conference on Monday Mr Obama dismissed a question about how the 
hurricane will affect the election, saying: 'I'm not worried about the 
impact on the election. The election will take care of itself of itself 
next week.'

At a campaign 
event in Iowa, Michelle Obama said of her husband: 'He has made this 
storm his priority, and he is going to do whatever it takes to make sure
the American people are safe and secure.'

Republican Virginia Governor Bob 
McDonnell said his state plans to extend early voting hours and restore 
power quickly to election facilities in the event of outages.

Officials in neighboring Maryland said early voting stations were closed yesterday.

Officials
from both campaigns said they were confident they would be able to get 
their message out and drive voters to the polls over the coming days. 
But they recognised that, after years of obsessive planning and nearly 
$2billion in campaign expenditures, the storm had introduced a 
last-minute element of chaos.

Unwilling to cede the mantle of 
leadership to Obama, Romney spoke by phone to Richard Serino, deputy 
administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Addressing supporters in Iowa on Monday, he cautioned, like Obama, that the damage would likely be significant.

In the competition for attention, however, Obama held a clear edge. His pronouncements in advance of the storm dominated television coverage Monday as he told the nation, "It's going to be a difficult storm.

'The great thing about America is when we go through tough times like this, we all pull together.'But Obama could bear the responsibility for any missteps in the government response to the storm.

Obama advisers said they had learned from President George W. Bush's widely criticized response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Bush was seen as ineffective and out of touch, and his presidency never recovered.

Aides at Romney's campaign headquarters planned to scale back criticism of Obama to avoid the perception that Romney was putting politics ahead of public safety.

'There's certain things we can't control and nature is one of them. We try to focus on the things that we can control,' said Romney adviser Kevin Madden.

There is some evidence that natural disasters can hurt an incumbent's re-election chances as voters often blame whoever is in office for adversity.
