Healthy promise: Jeremy Hunt will hire 2,000 GPs and emergency ward doctors by 2018

Thousands more GPs and casualty ward doctors will be recruited over the next five years to solve the crisis in emergency and out-of-hours care, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will announce today.

An extra 2,000 family doctors by 2018 will aim to encourage people with chronic conditions to head to local surgeries rather than overstretched hospitals, he will say.

A new NHS training body will also be ordered to sign up an unspecified number of A&E doctors.

And in a move to prevent a repeat of the Mid Staffordshire hospital trust scandal – where 1,200 people died through neglect – Mr Hunt will demand that half of all student nurses will undergo community training to revive the traditional caring ‘values’ of the NHS.

The plans are included in a ‘mandate’ issued to Health Education England (HEE), a new quango with a budget of £5billion a year to train NHS staff.

At the moment just 40 per cent of the 6,500 student doctors each year go on to be GPs.

HEE will be charged with lifting that number to 50 per cent, increasing the number of community doctors by 400 a year to 3,250.

At least half of the 17,000 student nurses each year will be expected to undertake community placements by March 2015.

Ministers hope it will encourage more trainees to take jobs outside hospitals and help keep patients away from overcrowded wards.

They will also spend a year working as health care assistants to improve basic caring skills and will receive training in dementia care.

In a foreword to the document, Mr Hunt wrote: ‘The terrible events at Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust reinforces the need to recruit NHS and public health staff with the right values.

‘Effective and high quality education and training must ensure that NHS staff are available in the right numbers with the right skills, values and competencies to deliver both excellent clinical outcomes together with patient-centred care.

‘Our NHS must become increasingly responsive to the patient and public need to deliver more care in the community and in people’s homes – in particular, to better support patients, and their families, with long term conditions and disabilities such as diabetes and dementia.’

A health department source said its 
five-year blueprint will tackle ‘historical shortages’ in emergency care
doctors amid growing fears that casualty units are at crisis point.

Up to 100 patients a day – 37,000 in 2012 – are being forced to wait more than an hour in ambulance ‘jams’ outside overcrowded A&E units, with delays of up to four hours at some hospitals.

And health bosses say there is growing evidence that up to a third of older patients need not be on the wards.

Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter added that the changes  would ensure those with long-term needs spent ‘less time in hospital and more time being treated at home’.

‘It is essential that we have the right staff to meet these changing needs, to ensure that we have set ambitious but achievable targets to make sure the NHS has a workforce fit for the future to deliver the highest quality of care to patients,’  he said.
