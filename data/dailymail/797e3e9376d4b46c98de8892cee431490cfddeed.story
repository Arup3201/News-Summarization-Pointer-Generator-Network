His epic and ultimately ill-fated trip to the South Pole is remembered for the demise of Captain Robert Scott in inhospitable Polar conditions.

But 100 years on from history's most doomed expedition, the real horror experienced by Dr George Murray Levick has emerged - in the unlikely form of notes he took on the sexual habits of penguins.

Amidst his incredible survival against the odds in the South Pole, Dr Levick made groundbreaking notes on the sexual shenanigans of the Adelie penguin, with findings so shocking they remained hidden for decades after.

Dr Levick's paper on penguin 
behaviour revealed evidence of homosexual acts, sexual abuse of chicks 
and even attempts by male penguins to mate with dead females.

The
 Edwardian explorer was so shocked by the findings in his paper, 'Sexual
 Habits of the Adelie Penguin', that he initially recorded them in Greek
 to make them inaccessible to the average reader.

Dr
 Levick observed how male Adelie penguins would gather in 'hooligan 
bands of half a dozen or more and hang about the outskirts of the 
knolls, whose inhabitants they annoy by their constant acts of 
depravity'.

To this day, Levick is the only scientist to have studied an entire breeding cycle at Cape Adare after he spent the Antarctic summer of 1911-12 there, according to the Guardian.

The
 expedition of Captain Robert Scott and his Terra Nova crew to the South
 Pole is widely-known as the one of the most ill-fated in exploration 
history.

Captain Scott 
had launched his bid to be the first man to reach the South Pole, but 
perished with his companions in 1912 after being beaten to the pole by 
the Norwegian explorer, Roald Amundsen.

Dr
 Levick, meanwhile, had been part of a crew assembled to support Captain
 Scott, only to become trapped themselves off the coast as Scott marched
 south into the heart of Antarctica.

Incredibly,
 Dr Levick and five colleagues kept themselves alive against all the 
odds for eight month in an epic survival trip to Cape Evans.

The men battled the perilous polar winter and survived in part by eating penguin meat and seal blubber.

They
 survived despite having been forced to spend an entire Antarctic winter
 in an ice cave, unaware Captain Scott and four others had died.

Captain Robert Scott and four others perished after reaching the South Pole on January 17, 1912 - only to find Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen had beaten them to it more than a month earlier.

But Levick survived, despite having been forced with five others to spend an entire Antarctic winter in an ice cave with few supplies after the expedition ship, Terra Nova, was blocked by ice on its way to rescue them.

Back in Britain, he published a paper called 'Natural History of the Adelie Penguin', but his findings about the species' astonishing sexual behaviour were considered so shocking that they were omitted.

This material was used for a short separate study, 'Sexual Habits of the Adelie Penguin', that was privately passed around a few experts.

The groundbreaking paper - which came around 50 years ahead of the next study on the subject - had been lost until the recent discovery of a copy by Douglas Russell, curator of birds at the Natural History Museum.

Russell has had the paper published in the journal Polar Record along with an analysis of Levick's work, the Guardian said.

Russell told The Observer, that the penguins' sexual inexperience is to blame for the antics that so disgusted Levick.

'Adelies gather at their colonies in October to start to breed. They have only a few weeks to do that and young adults simply have no experience of how to behave,' he explained.

'Hence the seeming depravity of their behaviour.'

Dr Levick, who served in the Royal Navy 
after his return from the South Pole, went on to found the British 
Schools Exploring Society in 1932, and died in 1956.
