A grandfather living in a Welsh border town has been told by doctors that he should move to England to receive life-saving treatment for his inoperable liver cancer.

David Gill, 67, from Berriew, Powys, has been refused the drug Avastin, which could prolong his life by years.

He is being treated 20 miles away at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital in Shropshire, but doctors will not prescribe him Avastin because he lives in Wales. Instead, they have advised him to move to Shropshire to gain access to the treatment.

In a cruel twist, Mr Gill, 
has received chemotherapy while a patient in the bed next to him 
receives the drug he has been refused.

Denied: David Gill with his grandson, Harvey. Mr Gill has been 
told by doctors that he should move to England to get the cancer drug Avastin, which could prolong his life by years

David’s daughter, Karen, said: 'To see 
the patient next to him having that treatment and him being denied it 
you just think what has he done to deserve that? It’s awful.

'He’s effectively being treated as a second class citizen because he’s Welsh.

His daughter Karen said: 'He’s effectively being treated as a second class citizen because he’s Welsh.'

The decision contradicts many other parts of Wales' healthcare system, where all citizens get free prescriptions.

Mr Gill's family say they are desperate for him to receive the drug and are appalled at the situation.

Avastin is one of the first of a new generation of 'targeted' cancer drugs. It avoids the scatter-gun approach of chemotherapy, which kills healthy as well as cancerous cells. Instead, it focuses on the protein involved in supplying tumours with blood, interfering with their work.

Alongside chemotherapy, it can shrink and remove tumours. One of its many advantages over other treatments is that it is extremely well tolerated by patients.

The drug is available to patients in England but three requests to Powys Local Health Board from doctors at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital have been declined.

Mr Gill was initially diagnosed with an inoperable liver tumour in 2011.

But
after seeking a second opinion from one of the country’s top liver 
specialists, he was advised that Avastin could vastly increase his life 
expectancy.

In a further frustration, he has also 
been refused Cetuximab chemotherapy and without that or Avastin he is 
not eligible to take part in medical trials which could also prolong his
life.

His son, Dean, said: 'We just want him to be treated as an equal. We
all feel really let down. My dad is always thinking of others, in the 
winter he would always be out early clearing the roads and pavements 
when the snow came.

'During the summertime he would be out doing gardening for the elderly. Now we just want to give something back to to him.'

His daughter added: 'It breaks your heart. There’s a patient in the bed next to him and you are seeing the nurses there giving them Avastin, just because they live somewhere else.

'It’s dreadful, it’s so upsetting. We just want the best treatment that’s out there. We want other people to be aware of what the situation is. It shouldn’t be like this and we hope it won’t be for other people.'

A spokesperson for Powys Local Health Board Powys told MailOnline it was 'not happy to discuss individual patients with the press'.

To make matters worse, Mr Gill's grandson eight-year-old grandson Harvey is embroiled in his own postcode lottery battle.

His hopes of reconstructive surgery have been dashed because Wales’ health service will not fund the operation in England.

Harvey, who lives in Welshpool, was born with Microtia Ear – a congenital deformity where the outer ear does not fully develop.

Until now, he has been treated for the condition at Birmingham Children’s Hospital (BCH).

His operation was due to take place at BCH after he had reached his seventh birthday but it now refers all patients to a specialist at a private hospital in London – with the NHS paying for operations.

An application for the operation was made in June, however, it was turned down because Harvey lives in Wales.

Harvey’s parents, Kate and Dean, have now been told the operation can take place in Manchester – but only if a funding application to the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee is approved.

However, if Harvey lived in England he would be referred to the specialist in London leaving Kate furious at what she says is second class treatment.

His parents have called on the Welsh 
Government to rethink its policy of giving out free prescriptions if it 
cannot afford to provide proper healthcare for its people.

Mr Gill said: 'I don’t understand why all 
prescriptions are free why don’t they just charge £2 and by the end of 
the year they would have raised thousands'

'Harvey told me: "Dad, I just want an ear, I just want to be like everyone else", it rips your heart out.'

His mother Kate said: 'It’s reconstructive surgery, not cosmetic surgery it’s not fair on him, he just wants to look like all his friends.
