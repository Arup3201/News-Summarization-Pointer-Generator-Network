Barcelona prankster-in-chief Gerard Pique has annoyed airplane staff by letting off a stink bomb on the club's flight to Finland, according to reports in Spanish newspaper Sport 

According to flight attendants, the Spain international dropped the stink bomb towards the rear of the plane - forcing furious staff to apologise to travellers.

The flight landed in Helsinki as scheduled where Barcelona will play a friendly against local side HJK on Saturday.

The joker! Gerard Pique is reported to have let off a stink bomb on board an airplane

Game for a laugh: The Spanish defender (3R) is renowned for playing pranks in the Barcelona dressing room

Pique is renowned for his practical jokes in the dressing room. In 2010 he was turned in by Carles Puyol for pelting the team bus with sunflower seeds and in 2012 he announced the premature arrival of his baby son with pop songstress Shakira before admitting it was a joke.

The 27-year-old is also reported to have teamed up with Lionel Messi to burn a moped belonging to one of the club's staff because it was too noisy - although the pair did replace it with a brand new model the next day.

Meanwhile, Barcelona have agreed a £15million transfer fee with Arsenal to sign Thomas Vermaelen, in what will be a blow to Manchester United.

The deal is now pending personal terms between Vermaelen's agent and the Nou Camp outfit before the deal can be finalised.

On Wednesday, Barcelona sent transfer negotiator Raul Sanllehi to London and he had productive talks offering a four-year contract, with the option of an extra year, worth £80,000 a week.

Sanllehi left feeling he had done enough to convince Arsenal and the player that Barcelona was his best option. They now believe the player is '99 per cent' theirs.

The news will come as a blow to Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal, as United and Arsenal hit a stalemate over the proposed £15million purchase of Vermaelen on a three-year deal.

Arsene Wenger is refusing to sell the Belgian defender to United unless a player comes in return with Chris Smalling top of his wishlist.
