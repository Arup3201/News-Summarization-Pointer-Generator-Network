Girls star Lena Dunham has landed the cover of Vogue, sources have told MailOnline.

The 27-year-old star is set to appear on the cover of the February issue, out on January 22.

And while it is yet to be announced officially, Anna Wintour gave her seal of approval to both Miss Dunham and her hit HBO show by turning up to the season three premiere in New York last night.

The U.S. Vogue Editor-in-Chief, who wore a colorful Prada fur coat, attended the HBO/Cinema Society-hosted event with her daughter Bee Shaffer - a big fan of Girls.

She was extremely friendly with the cast, and posed on the red carpet with Lena. She also gave Alison Williams a big hug and a kiss once inside the venue.

A representative for Vogue would not confirm or deny whether Miss Dunham would be appearing in the new issue, on newsstands from January 22nd, saying only, 'I can't comment on rumors of future editorial.'

However the source added to MailOnline today: 'Anna does love these Girls.'

 also observed that while Allison Williams, Zosia Mamet and Jemima Kirke
 has all been landing their fair share of glossy covers, Miss Dunham has
 been conspicuously absent.

'Could it be that she scored the most exclusive February cover of them all, Vogue?' they speculate.

Rumors of a Lena Dunham Vogue cover have been milling since October when it emerged that Ms Wintour would be hosting a dinner in honor of the Girls creator in a bid to persuade her to feature in the magazine.

According to RadarOnline, a 'well-placed
 magazine source' said that Ms Wintour, 63, wants to use Miss Dunham
 to attract younger readers to Vogue.

'Anna is trying to seduce Lena into bringing her next-generation audience into the Vogue brand,' they said.

'And she’s willing to violate a lot of 
Vogue traditions to do it, including putting her on the cover even 
though she doesn’t really conform to the body type that Vogue has 
featured for most of its history.'

If the rumors are true, she would be one of a 
small number of curvier women to front the glossy fashion title.

In
 the magazine's recent history, Adele is the only other 'larger' 
celebrity to have featured on its cover. The title was praised for 
cropping the singer's body just below the bustline after the UK edition 
was slammed for dodging the opportunity to feature a larger body by only
 showing her face.
