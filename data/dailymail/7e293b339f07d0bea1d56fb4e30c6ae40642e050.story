A boy who was once so sick he was read his last rites three times is preparing to celebrate becoming a teenager.

Connor Shaw’s family thought they would never see him grow up after he was diagnosed with a rare heart defect when he was a baby.

But football-mad Connor, from Chorlton, Manchester, has made a remarkable recovery after getting a new heart nine years ago - and now he's planning to mark his 13th birthday by throwing a party.

Teenage dream: Brave Connor Shaw is planning to celebrate his 13th birthday, a milestone his family thought would be unimaginable after he was diagnosed with a rare heart defect

His mum Maria Chebrika-Shaw, 45, hopes to raise hundreds of pounds for the British Heart Foundation by selling tickets for the bash.

Incredible journey: With the help of the British Heart Foundation, Manchester City fan Connor has been given some amazing experiences, including a meeting with his idol, Blues keeper Joe Hart

She described how her son had been on an
‘amazing journey’ in the past few years - with the British Heart 
Foundation organising for him to run out at Wembley and Old Trafford as a
mascot for the England football and cricket teams.

The City fan, who received treatment at Francis House Hospice, Didsbury, also met one of his football heroes, Blues keeper Joe Hart.

Maria said: 'We just wanted to say a big thank-you to all the people who have lent their help and support to Connor and taken an interest in his life so far.

'At the age of four, we weren’t sure if he would grow up to be a teenager.

'All his birthdays are special but this is his first party where it will be more than just his family.'

Connor was diagnosed at birth with a hypoplastic left ventricle, which meant only half his heart worked.

The condition left him so close to death he was read his last rites on three occasions.

He had a 10-hour transplant operation as a three-year-old and has since had numerous operations.

He is now on daily medication to make sure his body does not reject the new heart.

Connor
reaches his milestone birthday on August 10 and his birthday party will
be at the Hough End Centre, Mauldeth Road West, Chorlton.

He said: 'I am really excited about my 13th birthday party. I will be a teenager.

Amazing fightback: Connor shortly after his heart transplant at the age of four, which has given him a new lease of life

Giving something back: Connor with his mother, Maria, who hopes his 13th birthday party will raise money for the British Heart Foundation

Special memories: Connor with Australia cricket captain Ricky Ponting and his England counterpart Michael Vaughan during the coin toss at a match in August 2005

'I hope people will come as well and raise money for the British Heart Foundation.'

Maria is looking for help from local businesses to provide raffle prizes and buffet food for the party.

If you can help out - or would like tickets for the event, which cost £10 - email Maria on mchebrika@ntlworld.com.
