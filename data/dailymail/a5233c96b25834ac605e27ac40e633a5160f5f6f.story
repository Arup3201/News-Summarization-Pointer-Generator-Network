Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be remembered as one of the most significant cricketers in history but his retirement from Test cricket on Tuesday may just be the boost the ultimate form of the game needs in its most influential country.

Dhoni, who stepped down at the end of the drawn third Test in Melbourne, is hugely significant because he became the symbol of modern Indian cricket during the era when they emerged as the richest and most powerful of them all.

Yet his decision to concentrate on limited-overs cricket is welcome because for the last three years at least he has been a negative, indifferent presence at the helm of a side he once led to the top of the Test rankings as well as a World Cup.

Dhoni became the symbol of modern Indian cricket in the era they emerged as the sport's richest nation 

It is no exaggeration to say that Dhoni’s attitude in England last summer was little short of a disgrace as a rare away Test victory at Lord’s was followed by the cricketing equivalent of throwing in the towel in three successive matches.

Tests: 60

Won: 27

Lost: 18

Drawn: 15

Win rate: 45% 

Yet as soon as white clothing was replaced by blue Dhoni sprang to life and again became the dynamic, swashbuckling batsman and captain who has become a God-like figure in his homeland.

Perhaps we should not be surprised that Dhoni should prioritise the shorter game as it is one-day and Twenty20 cricket that has made him fabulously wealthy, with annual earnings of around $30million (£19.3m) a year.

No-one has had a bigger workload than Dhoni in world cricket – he has played in a staggering 398 matches since the start of 2008 - and something had to give but that does not excuse the uninterested way he has led India.

Highest Score 224 Average 38.09 

Hundreds 6 Fifties 33 

Catches 256 Stumpings 38 

Dhoni only survived the 4-0 thumpings by both England and Australia three years ago because of his close association with the discredited former India board president N Srinivasan but he should have gone after England’s 3-1 win.

As it was he staggered on until his heir apparent Virat Kohli finally started to replicate his prolific one-day form in Test cricket, hitting three centuries against Australia in a series India trail 2-0 with one game to play.

The gifted and feisty Kohli will take over for the dead rubber in Sydney in the new year and beyond and it is his style of leadership that provides hope that India may again treat Test cricket as seriously as they do the shorter stuff.

Kohli will be positive, as he was when he stood in for Dhoni in Adelaide at the start of the series, and is likely to display none of the conservatism that marked his predecessor as one of the most unimaginative modern leaders.

India will hope, though, that he can control a temper that has seen him clash with at least one Australian virtually every day of the current series, enhancing his reputation as one of the game’s biggest and most volatile sledgers.

At least life will never be dull under Kohli, who will be as interesting in public as Dhoni was dull, as demonstrated when the new captain said he didn’t respect Mitchell Johnson because the fast bowler showed scant respect for him.

Dhoni’s departure was typical of a man who has had little time for the media. He made no reference to his fate during the post-Test press conferences yet 15 minutes later a release confirmed that he would step down.

There will be little of the criticism that Graeme Swann attracted when he retired mid-series because Dhoni is largely fawned upon in India and attracts the sort of adulation that is barely credible for cricketers outside his country.

A visit to his home town of Ranchi for a one-day international against England two years ago was to see extraordinary levels of devotion and attention, something that, to be fair, Dhoni has dealt with calmly and with dignity.

Now, at 33, he will have more time to devote to his beloved motor bikes, his fascination with all things military and his support of Manchester United – he showed much more enthusiasm for India’s games of football during practice before each day’s play last summer than he did once he was out in the middle.

But MS Dhoni will be around for some time yet in the one-day arena where he can be expected to make both a big impact and huge amounts of money. Yes, a significant cricketer but he was some way short of being a great one.
