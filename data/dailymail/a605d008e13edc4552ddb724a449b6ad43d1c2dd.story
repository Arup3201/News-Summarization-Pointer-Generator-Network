NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell today apologized for his handling of the Ray Rice scandal - but refused to step down from his position. 

As Goodell broke his nine-day silence in front of the media in New York, he admitted poor decision-making and took the blame for mistakes in his handling of the recent domestic abuse cases involving players, but stopped short of offering his resignation.   

'Unfortunately over the past several weeks we have seen all too much of the NFL doing wrong and that starts with me,' he said. 

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell apologized at today's tense press conference, but refused to resign 

As Goodell broke his nine-day silence in front of the media in New York, he admitted poor decision-making and took the blame for mistakes in his handling of the recent domestic abuse cases involving player

However he stopped short of resigning, and admitted he had never thought about stepping down 

'I got it wrong with the handling of the Ray Rice matter and I am sorry for that. I got it wrong on a number of levels from the process that I led to the decision that I reached. I don't expect anyone just to take my word,' Goodell admitted.

'I believe in accountability I understand the challenges before me and I will be held accountable for meeting them.'  

Critics have been calling for Goodell's resignation and when questioned if he had considered leaving his role in which he earned  $44.2 million last year, he replied: 'I have not. I have focused on doing my job to the best of my ability. 

'We have a lot of work to do. I acknowledged my mistake on August 28. We are making changes.'

When asked if he had considered resigning from his role, he answered: 'I have not. I have focused on doing my job to the best of my ability'

When asked about his knowledge concerning Ray Rice attacking his then-fiancee Janay in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator he said: 'We got new information from the first time we meet to the initial discipline

He said one of the changes is the formation of a personal conduct committee which he hoped to have new policies in place before February's Super Bowl - he did not say if he would be part of the decision-making process. 

When Goodell was asked about the league's investigation of Rice's elevator attack  he replied he would rely on the findings of an independent investigation by Robert Mueller, the former head of the FBI.

He added that he has formed a partnership with two anti-domestic violence organizations.

The news conference came a day after Goodell sent out a memo to teams, saying the NFL has initiated a 'long-term commitment to help people affected by domestic violence and sexual assault.'

He said that his office is taking 'significant steps' to educate teams on the issue through a series of programs.

Goodell and some NFL teams have been heavily criticized for lenient or delayed punishment of Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and other players involved in recent domestic violence cases. 

Less than three weeks into the season, five such cases have made headlines. 

He wrote in the memo: 'We are also proceeding to implement broad educational programs within our league. 

'Starting within the next 30 days, all league and team personnel -- including executives, coaches, players and staff -- will participate in education sessions on domestic violence and sexual assault. 

'These initial sessions will begin to provide the men and women of the NFL with information and tools to understand and recognize domestic violence and sexual assault.  

'We will work with the NFL Players Association to develop and present this training in the most effective way. '

The NFL is also partnering with a domestic violence hotline and a sexual violence resource center. 

The league will provide financial, operational and promotional support to the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center.

Goodell said this will 'enable both the hotline and NSVRC to help more people affected by domestic violence and sexual assault.' 

Chris Rainey was cut from the Cardinals after being accused of slapping his girlfriend 

Yesterday the White House slammed the NFL over its recent spate of child and domestic abuse scandals, calling the revelations 'deeply troubling'.

An official said in D.C. on Thursday that the football league must 'get a handle' on its widespread issues of violence and have a message of 'zero tolerance'.

During a briefing on an awareness campaign about sexual assaults on college campuses, an official said the NFL had an 'obligation' to the U.S. and its millions of young fans to properly discipline those involved in abuse. 

 The White House official criticized the NFL during a briefing about the 'It's On Us' campaign, an initiative to fundamentally shift thinking about sexual assault and how to prevent it. 

President Obama was shocked by the video showing Rice knocking out his then-fiancée, his chief of staff said earlier this month.

'The president was shocked by what he saw, let's put it that way,' Denis McDonough said. 

An official later added: '...like any American, (Obama) believes that domestic violence is contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society'.

The White House's strong words came after another NFL player, Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer, was arrested on Wednesday.

Police said he head-butted his wife and broke her nose after she refused to have sex with him, and punched her in the face the next day.

The details surfaced in a police report a day after Dwyer was arrested on aggravated assault charges and deactivated from all team activities. He spent a night in jail and made a brief court appearance before being released early on Thursday.

Dwyer, 25, was arrested over two incidents that occurred on July 21 and 22 at his Phoenix residence, just days before the Cardinals reported to training camp.

The player denied assault but acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to the police report. As he was released from jail on Thursday, he said he never hurt his son.

He was ordered to wear an electronic tag and banned from contact with his wife. 

The Cardinals released a statement on Wednesday which said the team was 'aware of these allegations this afternoon when notified by Phoenix police and are cooperating fully.

'Given the serious nature of the allegations we have taken the immediate step to deactivate Jonathan from all team activities.'

The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy.

The Cardinals then released a second player accused of domestic violence.

The team announced on Thursday that running back Chris Rainey had been released from its practice squad.

Rainey was a fifth-round pick of the Steelers in 2012, but he was cut by the team after his rookie season when he was accused of slapping his girlfriend. He later pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct.

Cardinals inside linebacker Daryl Washington also pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy.

Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges.

On Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved.

Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling.

Critics have called for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case.

Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his brutal attack on then-fiancée Janay in an Atlantic City casino elevator. 

The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee Janay (both pictured at a May 23 press conference) in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator

Hundreds of Baltimore fans have formed a queue stretching back half-a-mile to swap their Ray Rice jerseys for other stars' in reaction to footage that showed the NFL star punching his then-fiancée unconscious
