Some of the Greenpeace activists held over a protest at a Russian oil right were granted bail by a Russian court today - but none of their British co-accused were among them.

The nine named today are the first of the foreign activists eligible for release from jail while awaiting trial for their part in the protest in the Arctic Sea two months ago.

The Primorsky court in St. Petersburg set bail at 2million rubles (£38,000; $61,500) each for the activists, who come from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Italy, New Zealand and Poland.

Emotion: Miguel Orsi of Argentina clutches a

bail after nearly two months inside a Russian jail after he was arrested
during the protest in October

Set for release: David Haussmann, left, from New Zealand and Cristian D'Alessandro, right, from Italy

'We can't wait to hug her': The mother of Argentinian Camila Speziale told of her joy at her daughter's release

Still facing trial: Paul D Ruzycki, left, of Canada, and Francesco Pisanu, right, of France, complete the list of those bailed today. However, all the suspects still face charges of hooliganism

The court said they will be released if the bail is paid within the next four days. Greenpeace said it would make money available as soon as possible.

One of the activists, Miguel Orsi of Argentina, sat in court clutching a photograph of his baby daughter and cried upon hearing the judge's decision.

Other activists bailed today were Sini Saarela from Finland; David Haussmann from New Zealand; Paul D. Ruzycki from Canada; Camila Speziale from Argentina; Tomasz Dziemianczuk from Poland; Francesco Pisanu from France; Christian D'Alessandro from Italy and Ana Paula Alminhana Maciel from Brazil.

Mr Ruzycki's sister, Patti Stirling, said: 'It’s a bittersweet day. We’re very happy Paul is coming out of jail, but we know his first thoughts will be for the people he’s leaving behind in prison.

'All of the Arctic 30, including Paul, are still facing very serious charges and we can’t for a moment think this is a victory.'

Ms Speziale's mother Paula Boscaroli added: 'We cannot wait to hug Camila and tell her how much we love her.'

Judges
in Greenpeace hearings had previously agreed with prosecutors that the 
foreign activists in the case were a flight risk, but the Primorsky 
court did not say whether the nine could leave Russia while on bail.

No trial dates have been set.

Still caged: Freelance videographer Kieron Bryan stands in the defendants' cage at a hearing yesterday. None of the six British nationals held over the Arctic sea protest were bailed today

Impounded: A crew member keeps watch aboard a coast guard boat, left, as the Greenpeace ship 'Arctic Sunrise',

it was seized by Russian forces

Thirty people aboard a Greenpeace ship
were detained in Russia's Arctic in September for a protest outside a 
floating oil rig and have been in custody since.

The
activists were initially charged with piracy, but investigators later 
said they were bringing hooliganism charges and that piracy would be 
dropped.

People convicted of hooliganism are normally subject to fines, not prison sentences - although the charges, if proved, still carry a potential seven-year jail term.

The Primorsky court refused to release an Australian activist, while another St Petersburg court has already granted bail to the three Russians aboard the ship, including prominent photographer Denis Sinyakov.

Nineteen other crew members are expecting court rulings on their detentions.

Mads Christensen of Greenpeace said: 'We cannot be at all confident that the Arctic 30 are going home any time soon.

'None of them have passports, so as things stand at the very least they could be restricted to Russian territory.

'And they are still charged with at least one very serious offence which could see them jailed for many years. Nobody at Greenpeace is celebrating yet.'

Former Beatle Paul McCartney had urged President Vladimir Putin to release all 30 of the detainees.
