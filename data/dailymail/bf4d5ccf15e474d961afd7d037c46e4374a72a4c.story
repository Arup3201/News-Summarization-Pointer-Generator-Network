The boxer is projected to make $90million in 2013, according to Sports Illustrated's annual list released on Wednesday.

Miami Heat star LeBron James is a distant second at $56.5million.

Golden: Kobe Bryant, right, is projected to collect just under $47million, including endorsement deals

New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees vaults into the rankings at No. 3 at $47.8million, thanks to a new contract he signed before last season.

Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is fourth at just under $47million.

Tiger Woods is fifth with $40.8million, his lowest spot since SI started the list in 2004. He was No. 1 through 2011.

Woods, who is coming off a big win at the Player's Championship this weekend, is beginning to find his stride after battling injury and very public battle with a cheating scandal.

But his overall value continues to decline, most likely due to the loss of several endorsement deals following the appearance of numerous mistresses across the country.

Right behind Woods was fellow golfer Phil Mickelson, who is expected to earn just under $40million this year.

Slipping: Tiger Woods was in fifth place on the list, his lowest spot since the rankings began in 2004. Until 2011, Woods was No. 1 each year

Injured, but making money: Alex Rodriguez, left, has not played all season but still made the top 10. Zach Greinke, right, broke his collarbone during a bench-clearing brawl after making just two starts in 2013

Rounding out the top 10 are New York 
Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Zach 
Greinke, whose 2013 seasons have been marred by injuries.

A-Rod has sat out the season so far while recovering from hip surgery, and is eying a return to baseball in mid-July.

Greinke broke his collarbone in a bench-clearing brawl in April after making just two starts - and is expected to pitch tonight.

Conspicuously absent from the list is Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who signed a six-year mega-deal in March that's worth $120.6million - making him the highest paid NFL player.

Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco, who signed a $120.6million mega-deal in March, does not appear on the list despite being the highest paid athlete in the NFL - because

But Sports Illustrated left out players who signed big contracts after their respective seasons had ended.

The top 50 include 25 baseball players, 13 basketball players and eight football players, with no female athletes for the fifth consecutive year.

Only one athlete came from the sport of auto racing - Dale Earnhardt Jr.

The team with the best representation is the Yankees, with five total players.

The estimates combine salary, winnings and endorsements.
