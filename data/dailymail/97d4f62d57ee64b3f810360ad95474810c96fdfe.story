It's not typically regarded as the most glamourous part of the capital.

But all that is about to change for Vauxhall, as constructors have today been given the go-ahead to build soaring 60-storey tower on the River Thames.

A 670ft residential block will be built overlooking the city, with up to 487 apartments, a swimming pool, gym, bar and private gardens.

The new building will be taller than the London Eye, The Gherkin and The BT Tower and will include two towers of 45 and 60 storeys

The building, which was agreed in a £700million deal signed in China today, and two towers will be built, with one containing a hotel, offices and roof top gardens.

The City Tower (East) will be around 200m tall and the River Tower (West) will be around 43 storeys high.

The 60 storey tower will include one of London's highest swimming pools, on the 27th floor, offering spectacular views over London

The buildings are expected to be linked by a walkway about half way up the building.

Lucky owners of the top penthouse will be able to peer down on the London Eye and Gherkin.

The only residents in the capital with higher views will be those who live in the multi-million pound flats at the top of The Shard, in London Bridge.

The 267 private apartments will offer spaces ranging from studios to four-bedroom flats and penthouse suites.

But it's not just the wealthy who will be able to enjoy the far-reaching views - the designers promise that there will be affordable homes.

Buyers will have to dig deep to afford the homes though.

The Evening Standard reported that homes, which have not been officially valued yet, are anticipated to cost between £500,000 to more than £3 million.

The designers have agreed with Wandsworth Council to provide 51 affordable homes on site with a contribution of £6.8m towards building more affordable housing in the local area.

Architect John Bushell said the One Nine Elms projects seeks: 'to build an iconic building which will provide a focal point for Vauxhall.'

Even when taking a dip, residents and visitors will be be able to appreciate the stunning sights, as one of the swimming pools will be on the 27th floor.

The deal was signed by Chinese developers Dalian Wanda Group and two largely unused buildings constructed in the Seventies will be demolished within weeks so that work begin.

Architects hope that a series of high rise towers will transform the area.

The deal is the latest in a string of plans to regenerate the Nine Elms area, the Evening Standard reported.

The £8 billion Battersea Power Station scheme and the new US Embassy are also being renovated to bring more housing, jobs and business to the area.

The One 
Nine Elms site is proposed as the tallest due to its location at the 
centre of the cluster and at the entrance of the Linear Park.
