Gazing skywards with their hands over their ears, these astonishing pictures capture the moment terrified Palestinians watch Israeli missiles falling from the sky before smashing into an apartment block.

As young men and children congregate in the street, Israeli drones target the building with three strikes, sending thick plumes of smoke billowing into the air just a few metres away.

An F-16 fighter jet then roars overhead to drop the final, knock-out missile, obliterating the building with an almighty boom that rocks the district.

The images, which captured the missiles from different points in the street, were taken earlier this week in Gaza City which has been under constant bombardment since the conflict began three weeks ago.

Just a few minutes earlier, the owner 
of flats had been told of the impending strike after the Israeli military phoned 
his son to warn them.

Bashir
 al-Ramlawi, 58, said he scampered out of the building with 35 of his 
relatives just in time to see his home reduced to rubble, it was 
reported by Sudarsan Raghavan from The Washington Post.

Many
 of his relatives - like some 200,000 other Gazans - had already fled 
their own houses and now they were homeless again.

As the dust settled, Mr al-Ramlawi said: 'I donâ€™t 
know why they hit my house. We don't know where we will go.'

Afterwards, people gathered to take take pictures of the devastation on their mobile phones.

Daily event: Some Palestinians are so accustomed to aerial strikes they knew the tactics employed by the Israelis - three smaller missiles fired to warn anyone too close to the target zone, followed by one from a fighter jet to destroy the building

Others simply walked nonchalantly on past the explosion, suggesting it was more than a daily occurrence.

Some
 were so accustomed to aerial strikes they knew the tactics employed by 
the Israelis - three smaller missiles fired from a drone to warn anyone too close, followed
 by one from a fighter jet to destroy the building.

It was reportedly a pinpoint strike which left no-one dead or injured, leaving it unclear why the Israelis targeted the building.

The images emerged as the three-day ceasefire collapsed, with both Hamas and Israel blaming each other for breaking the truce.

Blast: Smoke rises after an Israeli strike in Gaza City yesterday. Israel and Hamas have agreed to a 72-hour humanitarian ceasefire beginning today

The Israeli military saying militants had broke the agreement shortly after it began by apparently capturing an Israeli soldier and also fired eight rockets and mortars at Israel, one of which was intercepted.

Gaza
 health official Ashraf al-Kidra said that in addition to the dead, some
 200 Palestinians were wounded in the 'random' Israeli shelling of the 
Rafah area in southern Gaza.

The ceasefire, announced hours earlier by America and the United Nations, took effect at 8am local time (6am BST).

U.S. secretary of state John Kerry had earlier warned there were 'no 
guarantees' the lull would bring an end to the war which has so far 
killed more than 1,450 Palestinians and 60 Israelis.
