In the end, Kathy Taylor was in so much pain that she couldn't sleep, she couldn't walk, she couldn't breathe. 

The Utah mother-of-five had refused treatment for her terminal cancer while 26 weeks pregnant for fear of hurting her unborn son.The boy, Luke, came into the world in September, about 14 weeks too soon, and was gone two weeks later from an infection.

Yet in her darkest hour, Kathy didn't pray for life or health.

The 34-year-old mother asked only for her family to be comforted, for her final days to be peaceful, and for courage to face the tragic road ahead.

'I have to admit it has been extremely hard and I pray constantly for strength to endure cheerfully, to be able to continue to be kind and nurturing to my family till the end and I’ve been praying to not be afraid of what the end will look like,' Kathy wrote on her online journal, Kathy's Miracle, just days before she passed away on New Year's Eve.

'I pray to die peacefully without pain but don’t know if that will be granted so I’m hoping Christ continues to sustain me and keep me from having fear and anxiety,' she added.

In her final week, Kathy could barely stand for more than five minutes at a time. The pain in her liver became so intense, she moaned through the night while sleeping upright, the only position that mildly alleviated her suffering.

All she wanted was to hang on until Christmas, hoping her five kids and husband could remember one last holiday with her.

'I pray for my husband to be comforted,' Kathy wrote. 'I know this is hard for him. I still trust that God is completely aware and that everything will happen as it should.

'I will be grateful to be out of pain and with Heavenly Father and Jesus and hope to be able to offer lots of comfort to my family from the other side,' she wrote. 'I am so grateful they have so many wonderful people to turn to.'

Kathy was a devoted mother who gave everything for her children. In her final act of selfless love, she sacrificed her own chance of surviving cancer so she wouldn't terminate her sixth pregnancy during treatment

Kathy died at home on December 31. She had been diagnosed with melanoma in late August, when she was pregnant with her sixth child, Luke.

As the cancer spread throughout her body, Kathy refused treatment for fear of hurting her baby.

Because of the cancer, she was forced to give birth shortly after the diagnosis. Luke was born in September 11, 14 weeks premature. He died two weeks later.

National Attention: Kathy's story drew national attention, even singer Sarah McLachlan donated proceeds of a song Taylor covered to help with medical costs

Nathan described how he and his wife's parents discovered she had passed away. He said he fainted when he learned the news.

'As I realized [Kathy] had gone, I gathered her in my arms and embraced her. I could not believe it,' Nathan wrote.

'I was so sad that I had been asleep and not been with her when she passed. I was so sad it was already goodbye.' 

Kathy defied the odds. When she was diagnosed with the dangerous skin cancer while carrying her sixth child, Luke Taylor, doctors gave her only days, then weeks, to live.

Refused Treatment: Kathy refused treatment while she was pregnant for fear of hurting her unborn son

Kathy pushed through for months, exceeding doctor's expectations. When her liver began to fail, Kathy was forced to deliver baby Luke on September 11.

A post on the blog, chronicling the woman's journey, details Kathy's amazing sacrifice.

The post reads: 'With an inability to save herself, Kathy is devoting her strength to giving birth to the little one inside…one last act of selfless love.'

Defied Expectations: Kathy defied doctor's expectations, holding on for weeks then months with the deadly skin cancer

The mother prolonged the delivery as long as she possibly could.

Baby Luke was born weighing only 1 pound and 15 ounces, doctors whisked him to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Huntsman Cancer Institute and gave Kathy about a day to live.

Against doctor's expectations, Kathy got to hold and embrace her infant son, who died on Sept. 27.

The woman held on through her son's birth, her eldest child's birthday on Sept. 14, and her own birthday on Dec. 10.

In a post on the Nathan and Kathy Taylor Charitable Account, where condolences have poured in from those who knew Kathy or just knew her story, Nathan wrote that New Year's Eve will be a celebration of Kathy's life.

'I love you Kathy,' Nathan wrote to his wife on the blog. 

'I hope you know that. Woman of unwavering faith.'
