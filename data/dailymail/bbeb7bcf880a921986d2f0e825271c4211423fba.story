Two fisherman who were feared drowned after being missing at sea for more than two days have been found - after managing to survive on just two biscuits and a litre of water.

Jim Reid, 75, and his grandson David Irvine, 35, were reported missing after failing to return to Gourdon Harbour, Scotland, after lobster fishing on Tuesday morning.

Three lifeboats, a trio of search and rescue helicopters and several commercial crafts scoured the area for signs of life, but the search was called off late last night after a fruitless 48 hours.

All smiles: James Reid, 75, right, and his grandson David Irvine, 35,

being missing at sea for two days 

The men were rescued from the 16ft creel boat Water Rail, pictured above, by fishing vessel Sylvia Bowers, which stumbled across the boat as it was travelling from Buckie, Moray

The two men were later taken to shore on a lifeboat to Montrose, where their families waited for their arrival

The pair, who were feared dead by their families, said they ran the 
boat's engine to keep them warm and 'never gave up hope' they would be found, despite having just two biscuits and one litre of water between them

But at 7.45am this morning, the 16ft creel boat was spotted by a passing fishing vessel, 46 miles off the coast of Montrose, north east Scotland - with both men still alive.

The men, from Inverbervie, have now arrived back at the harbour in Montrose, where they had an emotional reunion with their families.

Mr Irvine said: 'The compass just sent us in the wrong direction and we ended up lost in the fog- we must have set it wrongly.

'We just had no idea where we were.'

The 50-hour ordeal began when the fishermen became lost in heavy fog after the compass broke on board the boat.

But despite rough seas and cold temperatures, Mr Reid said the pair 'never gave up hope' they would be found - even though they had just two litres of fuel left in the tank when they were rescued.

He said: 'We had two biscuits and a litre and a half of water, but we ate the biscuits on the first night.

'After the first day we began sipping the water to make it last. David must be about two stones lighter now.

'It
 wasn't too bad when we first went out but the fog started to come in 
pretty thick. Because of the fog on the first night we got completely 
lost.

The search for the boat had been called off late last night - just hours before the men were found by Sylvia Bowers, a fishing vessel which happened to be passing as it travelled from Buckie, Moray

'We just hoped somebody would come along but we never gave up hope. We ran the boat's engine at night to keep us warm. I got an hour's sleep, David got half an hour.'

Mr Reid said the pair spotted dozens of big ships passing them as they waited, but the ships were too far away for them to alert.

He said: 'I fired off my two rockets on the first night but then we were out. We just kept going and tried to conserve the fuel. It was such a shock and relief to see that boat come.'

The two men were said to be feeling fine after they were found and even felt cheery enough to have photo with one of the crew who found the men, pictured

The families, who feared the two men had drowned, were overwhelmed when they received the news that their loved ones were safe.

Speaking to The Evening Express David Irvine Senior, Mr Irvine's father, said: 'It’s just a miracle. I had kept hope when there was nothing found from the boat.

'I had to try and keep it together for everyone else. It is just unbelievable - I burst to tears when I found out.'

Mr Irvine's mother Marion Irvine said it felt like she was 'in a dream' after her son was rescued.

The 53-year-old said: 'I thought I was 
dreaming. I don’t know what’s happened to them on the water and there 
was always hope they would be found.

The two men returned to shore today to their waiting families who said it was 'a miracle' they had been found

'I have been tearful for the past few days and this is just unreal.'

And Mr Reid's sister Dorothy Milne, 72, who lost her nephew at sea more than two decades ago, said: 'It's just magic, that's all I can say.

'We found out he was lost on Tuesday. My sister and I were away on a trip. I just thought, we've lost another at sea.

Dorothy Milne, 72, who is Jim Reid's sister, said it was 'magic' that the men had been found

'I heard he had been found this morning. I was lying in my bed. My brother-in-law phoned and said 'I hope you're lying down', and I thought, he's about to tell me they're dead.

'He said: 'They're alive, Dot - 50 miles away they are'. It's just a dream. There must be a God.'

Mark Spence, understood to be a crewman on the boat that found the missing men, which was travelling from Buckie, Moray, wrote on Facebook: 'Ma night was affa boring untill we came across the two lads thats been lost at sea for 3 days now (sic).

'Got the lads on board safe and sound, now towing their boat to montrose to get them ashore, both men safe and sound.'

Skipper of the Sylvia Bowers, James Spencer, said his crew had set sail from Buckie on Tuesday and were heading to the English Channel at the time.

The 47-year-old, who lives in Buckie, said: 'They were very lucky.

'The two lads on watch were following a predetermined line and it just so happened that this boat was just off the line.

'They passed close by and they were waving at us. They were in a small boat and it was strange because they were 45 miles off the land.

'We didn't actually know what was wrong until they came alongside us and explained they had been out for three days.'

A police spokesman said: 'Police Scotland can confirm that the two fisherman, David Irvine and James Reid, missing from the Gourdon area, have been found safe and well today, approximately 46 miles off the coast of Montrose after being spotted by a passing fishing vessel.'

Chief coastguard Richard Martin said: 'We are delighted that the two men have been found safe and well, and will be reunited with their families.

'We thank all those involved in this search and rescue operation - including the crew of the Sylvia Bowers, the fishing boat which found the men.'
