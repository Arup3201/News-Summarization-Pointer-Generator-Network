Rio Ferdinand has accused Fabio Capello of having a ‘prison-camp mentality’ during the Italian’s four-year spell as England manager.

Ferdinand, who won 81 caps for his country, says Capello was the England manager who most disappointed him.

In The Sun’s serialisation of his autobiography #2sides, Ferdinand said: ‘Don Fabio, who was appointed to us in 2008, came to us with a sky-high reputation and I couldn’t wait.

Capello ran England's squad with 'a prison-camp mentality' according to Rio Ferdinand

‘But he brought in a prison-camp mentality. What a let-down! With Capello you have to just do what you’re told or you’re out.

‘We had expected ideas and creativity. Instead, Capello’s attitude was, “I’m the boss and you will do what I say all day, every day”.

‘I know people back home were expecting us to win the World Cup but that was ridiculous. There was no chance of doing anything. Tactically, we were all over the place.’

Ferdinand has also called Roy Hodgson disrespectful for announcing his England future was over on a train

Ferdinand also revealed that he thought it was disrespectful of England boss Roy Hodgson to announce the end of the defender’s international career on a London tube train.

Hodgson was quoted in October 2012 stating to fellow passengers that Ferdinand would not be in the England squad he named because his international career had reached ‘the end of the road’.

Although Hodgson later issued a grovelling apology, Ferdinand admits that their relationship never recovered.
