This impassioned parrot certainly seems to have had her feathers ruffled the wrong way by somebody.

Elaine Sigmon, 59, from Maiden, North Carolina, filmed the moment her pet cockatoo Peaches launched a fervent tirade at her husband, Don.

The angry bird appears to mimic a human arguing with a high vocal pitches and flapping wing gestures to match.

Her words are difficult to make out but she continues to determinedly sound them out.

Mr Sigmon merely sits in his chair watching television as he's squawked at. 

When Peaches fails to evoke a reaction, she turns around.

She then continues to rant at the wall.

After about a-minute-and-a-half, the parrot appears to calm down.

Finally, peace at last! Many viewers have deemed the bird's antics 'hilarious' and 'crazy'. 

It's not clear where she picked up her argumentative behavior from.
