A jury has been shown intimate photographs of murderer Jodi Arias that were taken by Travis Alexander in the hours leading up to his death.

While prosecutors have now closed their case in the sentencing retrial of Arias - convicted of murdering her ex-boyfriend - their evidence required jurors to sit through several days of lurid evidence involving intimate photos and phone-sex recordings.

Arias was convicted of the murder of her ex-boyfriend last year, but a retrial was ordered after the jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison.

Calls for her head: Jody Arias was already looking exhausted as opening statements began in her lurid sentencing retrial where prosecutors were swift to tell jurors that only a death sentence befits her crime

Following a prosecution claim that Alexander was afraid of 'stalker' Arias, defence attorney Kirk Nurmi responded by displaying to jurors pornographic images of Arias' private parts, AZ Central reported.

The photos were taken by Alexander in the hours leading up to his death - Mr Nurmi then asked the jury if they suggested Alexander was afraid of Arias as the prosecution had claimed.

Mr Nurmi then spent time going through photos showing Alexander in the shower - before replaying in full a 40-minute long phone sex conversation in which the two moan as if they were having orgasms.

The retrial opened a week ago with prosecutors telling jurors the Arizona murderer deserves the harshest sentence of them all.

'The only just punishment in this case is death,' Juan Martinez told the Maricopa County Superior Court. 

Mentally ill: Jodi Arias' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi argued his client is mentally ill and should not, therefore, be executed

Arias had her hair cut to shoulder-length for her return to the courtroom and appeared to have it dyed darker.

She has also been wearing a new pair of nude-framed glasses - perhaps because earlier this month, a Phoenix food bank auctioned off the glasses she wore at the original trial and raised close to $1,000 for charity.

Last week defense lawyer Kirk Nurmi began opening statements, telling jurors it was up to them to write the final chapter to the story.

The jury had been warned that it would see graphic evidence about the killing and relationship between Arias and victim Travis Alexander - but he said she should not be executed because she is mentally ill.

Prosecutor  Martinez proved his point by showing jurors a picture of Arias' victim, ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, with his throat slit.

'This is how much she loved him,' Martinez told the jury, according to ABC. 

The victims' siblings were in court today along with Arias' parents and brother.  

Arias was convicted of murder last year but the first jury was deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison.

That required a new jury and trial to decide her punishment.

A new jury that was picked over the past several weeks will listen as the former waitress tries to make another case that her life should be spared. 

Four hundred people were called as prospective jurors. Many of them were cut after they said they either made up their minds about the case or knew too much to be impartial. Some jurors cited their objection to the death penalty. 

They won't consider whether or not she's guilty - that's already been decided.

The retrial is expected to last into December. 

Arias stabbed and slashed Alexander nearly 30 times, slit his throat so deeply she nearly decapitated him and shot him in the forehead. 

Judge Sherry Stephens has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far

Arias was found guilty of first degree murder in the death of former boyfriend Travis Alexander, but the jury deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty or life in prison.

She left his body in his shower where friends found him about five days later at his suburban Phoenix home.

She acknowledged she killed Alexander, but claimed it was self-defense after he attacked her. 

Prosecutors said it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage after the victim wanted to end their affair and planned a trip to Mexico with another woman. 

Weeks after Arias was convicted, the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on her punishment. 

Her attorneys have since sought, unsuccessfully, to dismiss the death penalty as an option.

If another deadlock occurs, the death penalty would automatically be removed as an option, leaving a judge to sentence Arias to one of two options: life in prison or life in prison with the possibility of release after 25 years.

The sentencing retrial will be a mini-trial of sorts to get a fresh jury - of 12 women and six men, including six alternates - up to speed on the case.

At her last trial, she testified for 18 days, describing for jurors an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, a shocking sexual relationship with Alexander, and her contention that he was physically abusive. 

Her first trial drew a global following and inspired spectators to wait in line in the middle of the night to get a coveted seat in the courtroom. 

This time around, the judge has ruled that cameras can record the proceedings, but nothing can be broadcast until after the verdict. 

Judge Sherry Stephens has shut the media and public out of nearly every hearing in the case and drawn complaints from First Amendment lawyers that she has gone too far.

Judge Stephens said the hearing closures are intended to protect Arias' right to an impartial jury.

Attorney David Bodney, who represents several media outlets fighting for transparency in the case, said there have been repeated violations of the public's constitutional right to attend proceedings in the case.

The costs of defending Arias have topped $2.5 million and will mount during a second penalty phase. Prosecutors have declined to provide their costs to try the case.
