More than two dozen teens have been arrested in connection with a house fire at an unoccupied home where police say they've been hosting wild parties for weeks.

Brandon Pak and Gilbert Gomes, both 18, were taken into custody on suspicion of child endangerment while another 12 juveniles were also arrested after the fire destroyed the home in Mountain View, California.

Other charges the unruly teens are facing include arson, burglary, car theft, drug possession and drug sale, and police say more arrests are likely.

The fire began inside the single-family house on the 1700 block of Fordham Way about 2:15 a.m. March 16.

The same night a light blue 2003 Audi A4 was stolen from the property.

Mountain View Police Department spokesman Sgt. Saul Jaeger said the car appears to have been taken on March 14 and was later recovered in San Francisco.

The kids began having parties at the empty home after one juvenile who knew the family was on vacation broke in on March 7. The owners were away for the next three weekends.

'It was your typical house party gone bad,' Jaeger said, according to the Mountain View Voice.

Locals: Most of the students attend Mountain View High School, with a few from Alta Vista High School and Foothill College, Sgt. Jaeger said

'It's super lucky that nothing worse happened, that nobody died because of a huge fire like this.

The missing car made investigators suspect the fire was linked to a burglary and they quickly concluded it was not accidental.

In the probe, they discovered that local high school and college students had been descending on the home each weekend before the blaze, hosting large drugs and alcohol-fueled parties.

On March 16, three juveniles set a fire inside the home that they couldn't extinguish, police say. Their names and those of the other juveniles arrested have not been released.

Pak is also charged with providing marijuana to juveniles.
