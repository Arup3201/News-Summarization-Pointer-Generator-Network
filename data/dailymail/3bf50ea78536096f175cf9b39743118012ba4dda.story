New documents filed by the U.S. Justice Department against Libyan militant Ahmed Abu Khatallah further shut down claims made by the Obama administration that the Benghazi attack sprouted from from an anti-islam film.

The documents come after recent comments made by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that some of the attackers may have been influenced by the online video.

The court filings make clear those who organized the attack were part of a 'conspiracy' involving several members of the Ansar al-Sharia 'Islamic extremist militia', reports Fox News.

The government are trying to ensure Khatallah remains behind bars.

A motion filed Tuesday says that in the days preceding the attack, the defendant 'voiced concern and opposition to the presence of an American facility in Benghazi'.

A group of 20 or more 'armed men', including militia members, assembled outside the U.S. compound at 9:45 p.m. the night of Sept. 11, 2012, and 'aggressively breached' the gate carrying rifles, handguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.

They then stole a U.S. vehicle, 'forcibly entered' buildings and stole U.S. property.

'During this initial attack, buildings within the Mission were set on fire,' the court document says, according to Fox Noews.

The attack 'ultimately led to the deaths' of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information Management Officer Sean Smith.

Some personnel were able to escape the a nearby building.

Khatallah entered the compound and 'supervised the exploitation of material from the scene'.

The government motion went on to describe how Khatallah spent the days following the attack obtaining weapons and other equipment to defend himself 'from feared American retaliation' and capture.

The documents are part of the case the U.S. government is building against him as the defendant is prosecuted in federal civilian court.

The defendant is being held at a detention center outside Washington, D.C.

At a hearing on Wednesday, a Khatallah defense attorney complained that the defense team had limited access to the Justice Department's evidence.

The details in the first few U.S. court documents are a far cry from the Obama administration's initial narrative.

officials said the impetus of the attack was an anti-Islam video that was 'the result of opportunism, taking advantage of and exploiting what was happening as a result of reaction to the video that was found to be offensive'.

Then-U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice infamously cited the video on several Sunday shows after the attack.

The Obama administration has since acknowledged that there was no protest leading up to the attack, as there had been in other countries in the Middle East and North Africa.

The State Department's Accountability Review Board report concluded 'there was no protest prior to the attacks, which were unanticipated in their scale and intensity'.

The motivation of the attackers is still not known.

Clinton, in her new book Hard Choices, argued that it is 'inaccurate' to say no one was influenced by the video.

'I was trying to make sense of it. I think that the investigations that have been carried out basically conclude we can't say that everybody was influenced [by the video], and we can't say everybody wasn't,' she said in a Fox News interview.

Even a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in January said: 'Some intelligence suggests the attacks were likely put together in short order, following that day's violent protests in Cairo against an inflammatory video.'
