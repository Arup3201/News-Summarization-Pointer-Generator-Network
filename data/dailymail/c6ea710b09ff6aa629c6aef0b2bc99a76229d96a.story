That's how you know you've made it. Hobbit star Martin Freeman arrived in Auckland, New Zealand today in true movie-star style ahead of the film's premiere, in a jet emblazoned with his own face.

A longstanding favourite in the UK, the former 'The Office' star is poised for international fame upon the release of the new instalment of the Lord of The Rings franchise, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.'

This leap from household name to Hollywood stardom is marked by Air New Zealand's decision to paint the faces of Freeman and his co-stars across the side of a Boeing 777 jet.

Air New Zealand and the country as a whole seem to have taken Hampshire born Freeman to their hearts.

The airline is reported to have spend the larger percentage of its £51 million pound marketing budget for the coming two years on Hobbit-inspired advertising.

The giant movie graphic is the largest ever image of its kind to be put on the side of a plane.

The new film, the first of a three part epic prequel to the billion dollar franchise.

Director Peter Jackson's latest outing from middle earth is set to be a huge revenue spinner at the box office alone.

His previous Tolkien adaptations grossed a total of $6billion in movie tickets and DVD sales, and earned 17 Oscars from all three films.

Filmmakers hope this new surge in marketing activity will restore goodwill to a movie beset with controversy in recent weeks.

Just last week the estate of J R. R. Tolkien filed a suit again the film's producers over accusations of exploitative merchandising. 

The estate of Tolkien is upset at what it calls 'morally questionable' digital marketing including an online slot machine, according to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.

The Tolkien estate is seeking $80million from Warner Bros., its New Line subsidiary and rights holder Saul Zaentz Co.

Tolkien's family contends a merchandizing agreement extends only to tangible products such as figurines and clothing and not to electronic rights.

Warner Bros. declined to comment on the claims.

The producers of 'The Hobbit' have came under fire in the last two weeks from wranglers after 27 animals used on set during the filming of the trilogy have died.

While no animals were harmed during the actual filming, wranglers claim the production company is still responsible for the deaths because the animals were kept at a nearby farm filled with bluffs, sinkholes and other 'death traps.'

Four wranglers working with the animals claim they repeatedly raised concerns about the farm peppered with bluffs, sinkholes and broken-down fencing with their superiors and the production company, owned by Warner Bros., but it continued to be used.

Peter Jackson, the film's director, is said to be 'mortified' after a journalist was banned by the production company from reporting on the film's premiere.

Radio New Zealand reporter Cushla Norman had her passes revoked after writing negative stories about the the movie.

Mr Jackson had her credentials reinstated.
