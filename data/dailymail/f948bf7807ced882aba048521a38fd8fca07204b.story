An Argentine mediator filmed negotiating Top Gear's departure from Tierra del Fuego has branded Jeremy Clarkson a 'delinquent.'

Former local government minister Mariano Plecity was secretly recorded meeting programme chiefs before they fled their hotel because of local anger over a number plate on Clarkson's Porsche.

Clarkson and co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond staged a Butch Cassidy-style ending to their now-infamous south American special, screened in two parts at the weekend.

Yesterday Mr Plecity said the only similarity between the Top Gear presenters and notorious American train robber Cassidy, who fled Argentina after holding up a bank, was that they had 'run like delinquents.'

He also denied Clarkson's claims in a newspaper column they had been 'ejected for political capital.'

Mr Plecity, filmed meeting Top Gear security advisers at their hotel, told a Tierra del Fuego radio station: 'They ended the programme with a Butch Cassidy parody and it was real but only in that they left like delinquents.

'The idea they transmitted that they were forced to leave is untrue. They were invited to leave and they accepted that invitation.'

'Delinquent': Jeremy Clarkson was branded thus by local government minister Mariano Plecity, who also confirmed the Top Gear presenter left the area by plane, leaving technicians to drive out of the country

Confirming controversial Clarkson and his co-presenters left the southern city of Ushuaia by plane and were not with Top Gear technicians who were attacked by locals as they headed for Chile overland with a police escort, he added: 'Neither Jeremy Clarkson or the other two were in the convoy when it left the province.

'That was because the local government's primary concern was to save peoples' lives.

'We reserved 13 seats on an Aerolineas Argentinas flight which left Ushuaia for Buenos Aires at 7.30pm that same day with the three presenters and the production team.

'We made those reservations at their request after they accepted our invitation to leave the province and as soon as they decided they wanted to go.

'The local government never forced them to leave. They were invited to leave and decided to do so by plane because of the fear they were experiencing.

'Obviously the Malvinas issue is very important for Tierra del Fuego. It's something they've obviously evaluated in making their decision.

'The technicians were the only ones who left the area by land. They were about 15 to 20. There was no other option for them because they had all the equipment used for filming.

'We ordered the opening of a border pass to ensure there was no risk to their lives or wellbeing.

'While they were crossing, Jeremy Clarkson would have been nice and warm in Buenos Aires.'

Legendary robbers: Butch Cassidy, right, and his ladies' man sidekick the Sundance Kid, left

Notorious American bank robber Butch Cassidy is thought to have carried out two heists in Argentina - including his biggest.

He and his longtime partner in crime, Harry Longabaugh - aka the Sundance Kid - travelled from New York City to Buenos Aires in 1901.

They settled on a 15,0000-acre ranch in the country's southern Chubut province, presumably bought with the ill-gotten gains from their criminal activities in the U.S. - but by 1905 they were at it again.

On Valentine's Day that year two English-speaking bandits, thought to be Cassidy and Longabaugh, held up the Banco de Tarapacá y Argentino in Río Gallegos, 700 miles south of Cholila.

Escaping with a sum that would be worth at least U.S. $100,000 today, the pair vanished north across the bleak Patagonian steppes. Shortly after they sold the Cholila rance and fled to Chile.

But by the end of the year they were back in Argentina, raiding the the Banco de la Nación branch in Villa Mercedes, 400 miles west of Buenos Aires, taking 12,000 pesos.

Pursued by armed lawmen, they crossed the Pampas and the Andes and again reached the safety of Chile.

The story of Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was made into a 1972 film starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman.

Mr Plecity, Secretary of Institutional Affairs during Top Gear's Tierra del Fuego scare, also accused the BBC of making it appear local police were harassing rather than protecting Jeremy and his colleagues from angry locals because it made 'good TV.'

He told Radio Fuegina: 'The operative to get them to safety was very good. It worked very well. Locals were furious at what they considered was a provocation with the number plate and we ensured there was no loss of life.'

Of the Top Gear team's decision to abandon Clarkson's Porsche near a town where they were stoned by demonstrators, along with James May's Lotus and Richard Hammond's Mustang, he added: 'My personal opinion is that they left them as part of a show to be able to put into their programme.

'It was another image they had that they could include.'

The Top Gear team, featuring Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson and James May, were in Argentina as part of their mission to reach the bottom of South America in V8 sports cars and build a 'stadium' from containers

Clarkson upset Falklands War veterans in southern Argentina by driving through the country in a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL.

Despite denials, many observers still think the incident was a publicity stunt. Here’s why:

The 54-year-old and his co-presenters were taking part in a 1,400-mile filmed trek along Argentina's famous Patagonian Highway.

The trio cut short their trip and took an unscheduled flight out of Ushuaia on October 2 while leaving other members of their team to face an angry mob as they tried to escape Argentina by crossing to Chile with a police escort.

James May's Lotus car, Richard Hammond's Ford Mustang and the Porsche driven by Clarkson are currently being stored in a customs' building in Rio Grande near Ushuaia while officials decide what to do with them.

Clarkson told in his Sunday Times column after returning to Britain how protestors 'bayed for his blood' as they stormed the hotel in Ushuaia where the Top Gear team was staying.

He claimed he was the victim of an orchestrated government campaign and had to hide under his hotel bed following an ultimatum to leave Argentina as an armed mob warned: 'This is a mafia state, best you do as you're told.'

The BBC screened its two-part south American trek despite protests from the Argentine government.

Alicia Castro, Argentina's ambassador to the UK, called the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War in a letter to BBC trust chairman Rona Fairhead earlier this month.
