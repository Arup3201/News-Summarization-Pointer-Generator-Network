Being Prime Minister does not mean David Cameron can avoid the trials and tribulations of being a parent.

In an interview with MailOnline, he revealed details of a dash to A&E when his son Elwen was stung on the foot 60 times after standing on a wasps' nest. 

And he explained how, like millions of other parents, he is forced to listen to Disney hit 'Let It Go' again and again.

Running the country comes with enormous pressures, though David Cameron does at least get to live above the shop, in his Downing Street flat.

But being Prime Minister does not mean that normal family life does not go on, including moments of crisis.

The NHS is set to dominate the election campaign whether the Tories like it or not.

Labour has made clear the health service will be a key weapon in its attacks on the government.

But there is always the danger that as Prime Minister he only gets to see the best hospitals, smartened up for a VIP visit.

MailOnline reader, Demonica from Yorkshire, asked: ’When was the last time you accessed NHS care without prior warning, so that managers had no time to bring in more staff, paint the walls, hide patients and sycophantically pretend that the NHS is thriving under your watch?’

The Prime Minister also told MailOnline's political editor Matt Chorley that he had been forced to listen to Disney hit 'Let It Go' repeatedly

Mr Cameron revealed the moment one Sunday afternoon last year when Elwen and Samantha were badly stung on the feet.

In keeping with the government’s official advice, he called the 111 helping - blamed for sending too many people to A&E - and was, unsurprisingly, told to go to A&E.

Mr Cameron said: ’My son stood on a wasps' nest in Oxfordshire and I rang 111 as you should, gave all the details. They advised me to go to A&E in case he got anaphylactic shock.

The family went to the John Radcliffe hospital which serves his Witney constituency in Oxfordshire, where their care was 'very good'.

But he admits 'it wasn't a particularly busy time of day being a Sunday afternoon’, in contrast to the long waits thousands of patients have experienced this winter.

NHS staff gave 'brilliant advice' because young Elwen was 'in a lot of pain, poor thing'.

Mr Cameron added: 'He had been stung 60 times. Samantha stepped on it too, so she had been stung too.

'But he was very brave but they were very good, very reassuring. There's been quite a lot of changes at the Radcliffe actually. The A&E is in good shape.'

Even being Prime Minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from Disney film, Frozen, he revealed today

In 2013, the Camerons' daughter Florence was rushed to hospital after getting a sticker stuck up her nose.

A year earlier, the Prime Minister was mocked after leaving his older daughter Nancy in a pub in Buckinghamshire. 

Away from medical emergencies, Mr Cameron has to balance parenting with running the country.

But even being Prime Minister does not give him the power to stop another rendition of songs from Disney film, Frozen.

Asked if he is a Frozen fan, he replies wearily: 'I have no choice.'

His youngest daughter Florence, aged four, 'of course is Elsa', he says.

His security detail also have to put up with the songs on loop when travelling with the family.

'Florence has got an Elsa dress with all the trimmings and regularly launches into song.'

But he pre-empts the looming challenge to prove his knowledge of Elsa, Anna and Olaf: 'I don't know all the words but I have listened to it being sung more times than I care to remember.

'But I won't either give you Do You Want To Build A Snowman or Let It Go.' 

From Gogglebox and Game of Thrones to Boris Johnson’s hair, these are the really important questions MailOnline readers wanted answered.

And after five years in coalition with the Lib Dems, is Nick Clegg still his favourite political joke?

David Cameron revealed he is a fan of both House of Cards (left) and Game of Thrones (right)

House of Cards or Game of Thrones?

'Both. Thrones more than Cards. I’m a big Thrones man.'

If you were any character from Game of Thrones, which would you like to be?

'I think you don't want to answer the question is the right answer. I think Michael Gove said he is Tyrion Lannister and I think I'll let him play that part.'

Downton Abbey or Wolf Hall?

'More Wolf Hall. I'm loving it, I think it's very very good.’

What do you think of Boris Johnson’s hair?

'It's a work of art and should be preserved for the nation.’

WH Smith or Smythson (where wife Samantha works)?

'That's an impossible question and one that could lead to all sorts of... It depends what I'm buying.'

The Prime Minister revealed he would be 'delighted' to join Gogglebox's Steph and Dom Parker for an evening of drinking after admitting to being a fan of the show

Despatch Box or Gogglebox?

'I do think Gogglebox is extraordinarily insightful and I think if politicians want to understand how we are viewed at home it's quite recommended viewing.’

Would you have a night on the booze with Dom and Steph Parker, as Nigel Farage did?

'I would be delighted. They look like a really charming couple.'

'Someone said to me, you must watch it because it's very interesting when they watch the news.

'So I watched five minutes and I was hooked, it's completely brilliant.

What - or who - is now your favourite political joke? Presumably you can't say Nick Clegg any more... Or maybe you can?

'Who or what is my favourite political joke? I think today it is my good friend Ed Balls.’

The shadow chancellor floundered on Newsnight this week when he forgot the name of a Labour supporting businessman named ’Bill’. 

Mr Cameron joked in the Commons yesterday: ’Bill Somebody is not a person, Bill somebody is Labour’s policy.

The PM said today: ’I think Bill Somebody, which I didn't think of, I will credit the hardworking researcher Rupert Harrison with the authorship of this joke, but I thought it was a cracker.’
