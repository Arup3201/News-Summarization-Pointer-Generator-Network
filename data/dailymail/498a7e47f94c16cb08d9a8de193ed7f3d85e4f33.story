The disgraced husband of former top Scottish radio DJ Suzie McGuire has been spared jail after being convicted of a string of domestic abuse charges including breaking her finger.

Accountant Derek Mitchell 36, of Eaglesham, Renfrewshire, left his wife feeling like 'a broken woman' who tried to kill herself in March 2013 in a bid to escape her 'life of terror'. 

After being convicted of committing a number of assaults in 2011 in November last year after a three week trial at Paisley Sheriff Court he today learned he will not be jailed.

Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus gave evidence during the trial, when she told the court she saw Mitchell grabbing his wife’s arm and calling her a ‘slut' as she hosted an event at a luxury hotel in Scotland. 

She told the court: ‘He grabbed Suzie by the arm and said, “You’re really embarrassing me”.’

Ms McManus claimed Mitchell also told his wife: ‘You’re behaving like a slut, but then again you are a slut.’

She told the court she was ‘quite taken aback’.

Today Sheriff Susan Sinclair told him: 'You now accept you have a serious issue with the abuse of alcohol and have started taking steps to deal with it.

'Neverthelessm your conduct during 2011, in particular May 20 2011 was reprehensible.

'Your actions were that of a spoiled, jealous, possessive man with a predilection for violence.'

The sheriff added: 'You have been convicted of a serious assault in the presence of two small children and two further minor assaults on the complainer all during 2011.'

She said that the relationship was 'volatile' and that she 'cannot be satisfied' that there is no alternative to a custodial sentence. 

The accountant was found guilty of three assaults between May and December 2011, including breaking his wife's wedding finger after a local fair.

He was also found guilty of committing a breach of the peace at the family home in Eaglesham in November 2009, the day after a family party.

Mitchell drunkenly pulled his wife's wedding finger back - breaking it, in front of her terrified daughters in May 2011 near to their home in Eaglesham.

In a rage at a military event in September 2011 that Ms McGuire was hosting, Mitchell grabbed his wife and pulled her away, calling her a slut.

Months later in December 2011 the violent dad-of-two humiliated the DJ after she had hosted the Cash for Kids event and slapped her while she chatted with businessman Mike Ashley and even threw a punch at him.

He lodged a special defence of self-defence in relation to the broken finger claiming he was trying to stop his wife attacking him, but the jury rejected this version of events.

The former drivetime presenter gave evidence from behind screens at the court and described her husband as 'controlling' and 'manipulative'.

Mitchell, she said, was a 'prince charming that turned into a Jekyll and Hyde character' who had anger management issues that she couldn't predict.

The 45-year-old claimed she was flattered when a younger man showed her attention and wanted a family - as she did - and claimed she repeatedly took him back despite being berated daily and assaulted by the man who claimed to love her.

She told the jury: 'That's the embarrassing thing, I went back to that. I will never ever forgive myself for putting my children through that.'

She said she was so 'broken' in March last year, she went to an area behind Bonnyton Golf course in an attempt to end her life with painkillers and vodka.

The court heard Mitchell's actions were that of a jealous and possessive man with 'a predilection for violence'

Addressing the court in  mitigation, Mr Lavelle said: 'This was a relationship in which both parties were engaged in volatility towards each other and of course the accused has been convicted by a jury of assaults over the course of 2011.'

He said the 'shock' of his conviction made Mitchell accept he was an alcoholic and he has since been getting help.

Referring to the most serious charge Mitchell was convicted of, breaking Ms McGuire's finger, he said that while it is admitted, Mitchell maintains he was acting in self-defence.

He said it was 'highly significant' that the jury deleted parts of the charge, including that Mitchell grabbed hold of his wife's hand, and they left the part that was always admitted.

Mr Lavelle invited the sheriff not to send Mitchell to jail. 

He said: 'It would of course materially impact how it would affect his relationship with the kids, that's clearly something which is close to his heart.'

Today Sheriff Susan Sinclair handed Mitchell a community payback order with the conditions that he will be supervised for two years, must carry out 300 hours of unpaid work in six months and attend a domestic abuse programme.

He must also go for alcohol counselling and conform to a non-harassment order for the next six months, not to approach or contact or attempt to approach or contact Ms McGuire.

Passing sentence the sheriff told him: 'You now accept you have a serious issue with the abuse of alcohol and have started taking steps to deal with it.
