Christopher Taft, 21, was arrested on charges of aggravated assault

A pair of birthday pranks gone wrong have landed a Florida man in jail and his sister with a BB lodged in her buttocks. 

Christopher Taft, of Holly Hills, Florida, allegedly shot his sister in the backside with a BB gun after she gave him a phallic-shaped cake for his 21st birthday. 

Taft later told police that he thought it would be funny, according to WKMG-TV. 

His sister didn't think so. She called the cops. 

Officers arrived to the home on Sunday and arrested Taft on aggravated battery and battery.

His sister told officers she didn't want to press charges, but Taft was hauled away to the Volusia County Jail anyway. 

According to WKMG, Taft's sister had the BB lodged under the skin in her backside. 

She refused medical attention and said she would go to the hospital herself to have the pellet removed. 

Even low-power airguns - like the famous Daisy Red Ryder - have muzzle velocity of 350 feet per second, which is enough to break the skin.

Others, which can be used to kill small game, can shoot projectiles at velocities of more than 2,000 feet per second. 

It is not known what kind of BB gun was used.
