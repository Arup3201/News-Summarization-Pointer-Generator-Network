A rock singer who claimed that he was forced to quit his day job after a female colleague sexually harassed him by slapping his bottom and sending him lewd texts has lost his sexual discrimination case.

Tom Ford, 31, said Lucy Myers constantly complimented his looks, gave him gifts and bought cooked food into work for him to win his affection.

But when he rejected her advances, the 34-year-old American became hostile, he claimed, sending rude messages and criticising his glamour-model girlfriend.

Claims: Tom Ford, left, said Lucy Myers, right, constantly complimented his looks, gave him gifts and bought cooked food into work for him to win his affection while they were both employed by a furniture company

Mr Ford and Miss Myers, from Highmoor, Oxfordshire, worked together at a bespoke furniture company in the upmarket village of Rotherfield Greys, South Oxfordshire.

It is where Mr Ford worked when he was not playing with his rock band, Motherload. He is the band's lead singer and has played gigs in Europe and around the UK. 

He told the employment tribunal that he repeatedly complained to David Gibbon, his boss at the Good Shelf Company, but was rebuffed for being ‘over-sensitive’.

He said he had no choice but to resign and attempted to sue the company for sexual discrimination, unfair dismissal and constructive dismissal. 

The tribunal, in Reading, was told the problems began soon after Mr Ford, from Henley, began working at the company.

Miss Myers described his girlfriend Sarah-Jayne Whiteley as ‘Barbie’ and a ‘bimbo’ and said she had fake breasts, he said.

Couple: Mr Ford claims Miss Myers would make derogatory comments about his glamour model girlfriend of five years, Sarah-Jayne Whiteley (pictured with him), describing her as a 'barbie', 'bimbo' and 'fake t**s'

She would repeatedly slap his buttocks and on occasions brush her breasts against him, he said, adding that she seemed to enjoy making him feel uncomfortable.

'Lucy would brush past me whilst in my area, pushing her breasts against me. I told her not to touch me and to be strictly professional,’ Mr Ford told the tribunal.

Mr Ford claimed Miss Myers began bringing him hair care products as gifts and even put a plate of food on his car seat in an attempt to win his affection. 

The day before she was due to leave for a new job last October, they met for a drink to try to sort out their problems. Mr Ford said Miss Myers admitted she had feelings for him but they ended the evening on good terms.

After ending that evening on good terms and exchanging text messages in which Mr Ford said he had a good time, Mr Ford said Miss Myers launched a tirade of verbal abuse at him on her last day at the company.

'She stated I was a real piece of s***, a c*** and that I needed to get over myself,' he said. 

A few weeks later she returned to the company as a general manager. Mr Ford said he suspected Miss Myers and Mr Gibbon were having an affair after spotting her hand-feeding him chocolates in the office.

He claimed he was demoted to packing the furniture, rather than building it. 

On December 13, he was accused by Mr Gibbon of being late and having too much time off, both of which were ‘fabricated’, he said.

On December 28, Mr Ford was told in an email from Mr Gibbon that he would not be needed to work in January. He immediately sent in his resignation. 

But Jack Mitchell, representing Mr Gibbon, said Mr Ford enjoyed female attention.

He said Miss Myers may have inadvertently brushed against him in the cramped workshop but did not do so on purpose.

Mr Ford made no mention to Mr Gibbon of being harassed, he said. He had joined in the flirting with Miss Myers when the pair first worked together and they had engaged in playful ‘high jinks’.

Mr Gibbon told the hearing that Mr Ford’s attitude and effort at work deteriorated to the point where he had to be made redundant. 

Miss Myers, from Highmoor, near Henley, said she had been 'shocked and disgusted to discover the vulgar allegations' made by Mr Ford after he left the furniture company. 

Mr Ford's claims, made at an employment tribunal in Reading, have been dismissed by a judge who reserved his judgement until providing a written ruling.

Speaking following the judgement, company owner Mr Gibbon said: 'We're just glad that the matter has been brought to an end and that commonsense has prevailed.

'We have got a really good team and now we can concentrate on taking the business forward.'
