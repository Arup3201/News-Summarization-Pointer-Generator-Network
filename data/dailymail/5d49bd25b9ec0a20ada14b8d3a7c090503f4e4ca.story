This camera hit the ground with a bump - but it survived.

Incredible footage recovered from a GoPro thought to have fallen out of a plane shows its dizzying journey through the air before it came to rest in a pig pen.

Seconds later the video recovered from it shows the camera surrounded by hogs wanting to sniff what must have seemed a very mysterious object that fell out of the sky and into their yard.

The camera starts recording in a plane flying high over farmland in the U.S. before it appears to be dropped

The video was posted on YouTube by the farmer in the U.S. who claims she found it and has already attracted more than one million views.

In the clip's description, Mia Munselle said: 'Camera falls from a sky diving airplane and lands on my property in my pig pen.  I found the camera eight months later and viewed this video.'

Go-Pro is a brand of high-definition personal cameras.

The
 cameras, which are popular among extreme sports enthusiasts, have wide 
angle lenses that take in much of the view. The latest models can take 
up to 30 images a second for six hours.

One poster said: 'Notice towards the end of the fall that the camera was spinning so fast 
in the air that it matched the frame rate of the camera (approx 30 
frames per second) giving an almost stable view of the final few seconds
 of descent. Magical stuff!'
