Corrective Services officers chased the man and two warning shots were fired at the man before he was recaptured.

He was not hurt in the incident and he was taken back into custody.

A spokesperson for Wollongong Hospital told the Illawarra Mercury that hospital staff do not have oversight over patients who are in custody.

'Police have taken the man to Wollongong Police Station where it is anticipated he will be charged.

'Police and Corrective Services NSW investigations into the incident are continuing.

'The correctional officer sustained minor facial injuries and was treated by paramedics.'
