A young woman who became the face of an organ donor campaign with the slogan ‘I’d Give You One’ has died from cystic fibrosis.

Kerry Thorpe, 23, died before a donor could be found for her.

She was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis as a baby and her condition rapidly worsened in recent years.

Kerry Thorpe, 23, died of cystic fibrosis on Friday because a lung donor could not be found for her

She needed a double lung transplant but was told two years ago she would never be well enough to join the transplant list unless she put on weight and got her diabetes under control.

Ms Thorpe, from Kesgrave, in Suffolk, managed to achieve these feats and was put on the transplant list.

In 2011 she also posed for striking posters for a national campaign for the Live Life Then Give Life charity.

The images, showing Ms Thorpe, also carried the tongue-in-cheek slogan ‘Would You Give Her One?’

But tragically, her own life-saving donor was never found and she died in hospital on Friday with her family, fiancé Joshua Nelli, and puppies, at her side.

The charity said Ms Thorpe was still helping their campaign despite her death as 77,000 people have now viewed their Facebook page.

Ms Thorpe was the face of an organ donor campaign with the slogan 'Would You Give Her One?'

Mandy Venters, Live Life Then Give Life’s chairwoman, said: ‘We were devastated to hear that our wonderful ambassador Kerry Thorpe passed away whilst awaiting a lung transplant.

‘She was a role model for many people. She fought her way on to the transplant list and battled hard to remain here for that call and second chance.

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus.

Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive.

As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required.

There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections.

The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat infections.

The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus.

For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene.

In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition.

About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis.

As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically.

Life expectancy remains in the 40s.

‘Like many others, I was in awe of 
Kerry’s determination and resilience and immensely grateful for the 
fantastic support she gave Live Life Then Give Life.

‘She was dedicated to raising awareness of organ donation, not least during our “I’d give you one” campaign which made a significant impact over the past couple of years.

‘Over 77,000 people have reviewed our Facebook posting and more than 560 people have shared it on their timeline, so we hoped that Kerry continues to inspire people to “Think about it, Talk about it and Do something about it” as it would be the finest tribute to her.’

Posting on a tribute page ‘The Kerry Alex Thorpe Trust’ Mr Nelli, 26, said: ‘This page has been set up in memory of my inspiring fiancée Kerry Alex Thorpe.

‘Although her time with us was cut far too short she managed to make some amazing friends and raise an incredible amount of awareness for both cystic fibrosis and the desperate need for organ donation.

‘Myself and her family are passionate that all of Kerry’s hard work doesn’t go to waste so we will continue her legacy even after she’s gone.’

Friend Sharon Morphew wrote: ‘We were lucky to have been touched by this beautiful and amazing young woman, everyone should carry a donor card. I’m sure you will reach the target and so much more xx’

And Kerri Langley wrote: ‘Joshua, Jacqui & Kimberley you must be so proud of how many lives Kerry touched - a true inspiration x x x x’

Kimberley Liane Kneil also posted: ‘It’s still not sinking in Kerry. My beautiful lung warrior, you fought so hard & yet time just ran out.

‘I can’t believe we never got to walk the puppy dogs on the beach & we were only talking about it the other week...

‘I’ll
 make it my mission to live life how you’d have wanted me too. Will miss
 you loads sweet but we’ll meet again. Until then, party hard up their 
my angel.’

Ms Thorpe leaves behind her mother, Jacqui Brett, father Gary Thorpe, 44, and sister Kimberley Thorpe, 21.

Ms Thorpe was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was a baby but her condition worsened recently

When she was first put on the transplant register, she took to her blog to put up posts of her hopes for the future.

She wrote: ‘Before I was listed, I was seeing myself going downhill fast, day-by-day. Yet there was no hope to cling onto, no light at the end of the tunnel, I was absolutely stuck in limbo but I still kept the belief and I carried on.

‘But now it’s different, no matter how ill I feel or how much of a bad day I am having, I have that hope of a call, and that is something I can hold onto because a call could come at literally any second, it’s exciting but damn right nerve-wracking at the same time!!!’
