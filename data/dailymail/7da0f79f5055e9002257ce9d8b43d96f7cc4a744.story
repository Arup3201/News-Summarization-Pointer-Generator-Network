The country of Dominica is a tropical paradise in the Lesser Antilles region of the Caribbean Sea with an average temperature of 77 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter months and precisely zero snowfall.

But, thanks to a couple of carpetbagging amateur skiers who live in Montana, it now has an Olympic cross-country ski team for the first time ever.

However, their fraudulent scheme has come crashing spectacularly down around them.

It has been revealed that the two founding members of Dominica's Winter Olympic team, Gary di Silvestri and his wife, Angelica Morrone, in their late-40s, 'scammed the Olympics and the press' with reportedly fictitious tales about the backgrounds of its athletes - namely themselves.

They invented phony athletic accomplishments to pad their sports backgrounds and then 'donated' nearly $200,000 to their host country in order to gain citizenship to qualify for its Olympic team, according to the sports website Deadspin.

At one point, Ms Morrone was accused of bribing Olympic officials on behalf of her then-employer, Fiat.

Olympians: Morrone didn't show up to her 10k race and di Silvestri didn't make it to the first checkpoint in the men's 15k

The
 couple are the lone members of Dominica's Winter Olympic team, which 
may seem odd considering di Silvestri originally is from Staten Island, 
New York, and Morrone is an Italian national currently residing with di 
Silvestri in a 'mountain palace' in Montana.

The many myths about the Olympic couple that have been a source for 'puffy' media pieces during the Games, however, were outed by longtime sports journalist Dave McKenna in a lengthy report for Deadspin.

According to the report, the couple took advantage of what the tiny nation sells on its website as 'economic citizenship,' which means any married couple can become a Dominican citizen if they deposit $175,000 'into the appropriate account at the National Commercial Bank of Dominica.'

Another $3,530 must then be paid to the Ministry of Finance for fees and tariffs, and just like that you're a citizen of Dominica and can qualify to form the tropical country's previously non-existent Winter Olympic team.

According to McKenna, the couple makes a compelling case for 'closing the eligibility loopholes that allow moneyed pranksters to dress up as Olympians.'

Morrone, at 48 years old, is the oldest Olympic cross-country skier in Olympic history by seven years. She didn't even show up for the 10k Women's Classic - the only one of the 76 racers who didn't make it to the starting line.

Price is right: The couple paid nearly $200,000 to become citizens of Dominica in order to create its first-ever Winter Olympic team

For his part, di Silvestri, 47, started the 15k Men's Classic, but quit after a few hundred meters. He was the only participant who didn't make it to at least the first checkpoint.

In a fawning piece by the UT San Diego, which lamented the loss of an 'Olympic fairytale' created by the couple who were granted citizenship after helping to build a children's hospital in Dominica', Ms Morrone detailed the reasons why neither was able to compete.

She said they both missed their events after being admitted to the hospital the day after the opening ceremony.

Ms Morrone told the publication her husband had acute bacterial gastroenteritis, while she had a fall on the slopes that required three surgeries on her nose and a 36 hour intensive care stay.

Then there's the issue of the bio for the couple that has been pounced on by fawning members of the sporting press who didn't dig quite as deep into the legitimacy of the couple's claims as McKenna.

The former Washington City Paper columnist, McKenna describes the couple's backgrounds as being 'full of exactly the sort of petty 
vanity and low-rent corruption you would expect of a middle-aged couple 
who bought their way into Olympic competition.'

Of the doting media, McKenna cites NBC OlympicTalk's writeup of the pre-Olympic athletic accomplishments of di Silvestri, which describes him as a 'two-time state wrestling champion' who 'rowed for a national championship team at Georgetown.'

According to McKenna, neither of those claims were true.

He writes: 'Steve Meehan, a wrestling obsessive from Long Island who has compiled a 
comprehensive history of the New York state championship meets from 1962
 through last year, says his records show that di Silvestri 'was never' a
 state titlist.

'In fact, di Silvestri's name doesn't show up anywhere in
 Meehan's database, which includes the top six finishers for every year 
in the last half-century.'

On his blog and LinkedIn page, di Silvestri describes himself as a 'New York Downstate Wrestling Champion as well as a three-time New York City Wrestling Champion.'

Big Sky: The couple currently lives in Big Sky, Montana, more than 3,000 miles from the island nation they're representing in the Olympics

As McKenna discovered, those claims are likely untrue, as there is no record of him winning any state or city wrestling championships. In fact, there is no record that a 'downstate' wrestling title even exists in New York state, and if it does, 'di Silvestri is the only man on the planet claiming to be a "downstate wrestling champion"—from anywhere, not just New York.'

As for the 'national championship' he won while rowing at Georgetown, McKenna found that 'no boat from Georgetown won an IRA championship during di Silvestri's years at the school.'

McKenna quotes Whit Fosburgh, the coach of the Georgetown crew team when di Silvestri was a student at the university, as saying that while the crew team did win some honors in the years Dominica's new winter Olympian was a student, di Silvestri had little to do with any of it.

'Gary wasn't in the boats
 that medaled those years,' Fosburgh told McKenna.

Scandal: Morrone was implicated in allegations that she attempted to bribe an Olympic official while working for Fiat in the 1990s

Morrone's Olympic experience dates back much further than her husband's recent, unexpected foray into the world of competitive skiing. 

In the 1990s, Morrone was going by her married name, Angelica di Silvestri, while working as a marketing official for the Fiat car company.

Fiat, at the time, was lobbying the International Olympic Committee to have it hold the 1997 skiing world championships in Italy.

Marc Hodler, a whistle-blowing Swiss attorney, charged members of the IOC with accepting payments in exchange for their votes in favor of one country over another to host the event.

One of those IOC members, Howard Peterson - the former president of the U.S. ski team and IOC voter - affirmed the claims made by Hodler, saying 'Fiat offered him two of the company's cars in exchange for voting to 
award the event to Sestriere, Italy,' according to McKenna's report.

Carpetbaggers: Di Silvestri and Morrone claim their looking to purchase a home in their new country

According to McKenna, 'the alleged perps from Italy were so brazen that they even gave him 
their business cards while telling him to call as soon as he was ready 
to accept the four-wheeled bribes.

'One of the card-carrying alleged 
bribers who approached Peterson was a Fiat marketing official named 
Angelica di Silvestri.'

Peterson is now the general manager of a cross-country ski resort in Utah called Soldier Hollow.

When told the same Italian woman who once tried to buy his vote when he was a member of the IOC is now representing a small Caribbean country in the Winter Olympics after apparently buying citizenship to join the Olympic team, Peterson apparently was shocked.

'People do that?' he asked.
