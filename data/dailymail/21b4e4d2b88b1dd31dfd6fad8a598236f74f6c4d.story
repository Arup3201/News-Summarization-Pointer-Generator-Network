A Downs Syndrome man suffocated to death while being arrested by police for refusing to leave a movie theater, it was announced today.

The Baltimore County Medical Examiner's office declared that 26-year-old Robert Saylor died by homicide while being taken into custody by three officers in Frederick, Maryland, ABC News reports.

Doctors say Saylor was asphyxiated in the incident on January 12.

Three deputies attended a call from an employee at the Westview movie theater.

They found Saylor with a health aide refusing to leave the screen where they had been watching Zero Dark Thirty.

The New Market man, remembered for his love of music, was handcuffed and allegedly resisted arrest.

According to ABC it is alleged his face was put to the ground when he was being apprehended by the officers, who then realized he was suffering a 'medical emergency'.

The officers removed the handcuffs, administered first aid and took him to Frederick Memorial Hospital where he later died.

'They made numerous attempts to get him to leave, he was cursing at them, at that point they psychically removed him, and he began having the medical emergency,' says Cpl. Jennifer Bailey, of the Frederick County Sheriff's Office told YourState4.com.

'They immediately removed the handcuffs and administered first aid. It's a very sad case, and not something we see everyday.'

Saylor's mother, Patti Saylor, told the ABC her son should never have been arrested.

'He has never had anyone put their hands on him in their life,' says Patti Saylor. 'He would not have been doing anything threatening to anybody.'

Authorities say they are investigating the incident.

The three deputies Lt. Scott Jewell, Sgt. Rich Rochford and Deputy First Class James Harris are still on duty. 

Saylor, often known by his middle name Ethan, was said to be a 'cherished member of Damascus Road Community Church' where he was a member of the men’s choir.
