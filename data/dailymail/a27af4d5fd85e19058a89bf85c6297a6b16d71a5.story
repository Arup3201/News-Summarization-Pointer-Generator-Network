Jihadi John dumped two schoolboys on the M1 motorway at gunpoint in revenge for an attack on his brother, it was revealed today.

Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as the killer in the infamous ISIS beheading videos last week - carried out the kidnap during his days living on a notorious housing estate.

He and two bearded associates are said to have abducted two gang members accused of beating up his younger brother, Omar, in 2008.

The brothers were living on the Mozart estate in west London at the time of the incident, which was known for its postcode gang 'the Mozart Bloods'.

A former friend of Omar told the Evening Standard today that he went to buy a stolen bike from Emwazi's younger brother in 2008, a time when the now notorious terrorist was still studying at Westminster University.

The friend, who was 14 at the time, said he and Omar were then attacked by two teenage members of the 'Bloods', who broke his arm because he was from a different postcode and punched Omar in the face.

When Emwazi found out about the incident, he sought revenge on the two schoolboys who had carried out the beating, the source said.

He told the London paper: 'They drove round in a car and found these two guys who attacked us, threatened them with a gun, made them take all their clothes off and drove off.

'They dumped them on the M1 motorway. They weren't attacked physically but they were threatened. It was a message.'

Details of Emwazi's links to criminals have emerged since he was unmasked as the ISIS killer last week

The source said Emwazi was not a known gang member at the time but was 'a bit of a hard nut'.

Since Emwazi was unmasked as Jihadi John last week,  his links to criminals during his time growing up in London have been exposed.

He was known to associate with Choukri Ellekhlifi – a member of a gang which preyed on rich targets in a series of violent attacks and who also later travelled to Syria to join ISIS.

The Moroccan-born criminal was thought to have been two years below Emwazi at Quintin Kynaston academy in St John's Wood, North West London, which Omar also attended.

It was also revealed last week that Emwazi stood trial twice, accused of having stolen bikes hidden in the family shed and was twiceacquitted.

The first case only came to court after the owner of one of the stolen bikes tracked down Emwazi, who had put it up for sale on Ebay.

The victim contacted him posing as a prospective buyer to get his details which he then passed on to the police.

Emwazi faced five charges of possession of criminal property on or before September 29 2010, 'knowing or suspecting it to represent the proceeds of criminal property.'

Emwazi, who was 22 at the time, claimed he had bought the bikes from the GumTree website and was selling them on at a profit.

The judge directed the jury to find Emwazi not guilty after a two day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in June 2011.

Emwazi faced a second trial at Southwark Crown Court a few months later in December 2011 for a similar case where he was also acquitted.

Omar, five years his junior, pleaded guilty to possession of stolen goods - bikes - at Isleworth Crown Court in West London in August 2012. 

Emwazi family in England are now in hiding while father in living in his native Kuwait, from where he has questioned whether his son Mohammed is the killer in the Jihadi John films.

It was reported today that Emwazi - who was known to the security services after being accused of trying to get into Somalia - slipped out of Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry before crossing Europe to get to Syria.

The BBC has defended its coverage of the unmasking of Jihadi John as Mohammed Emwazi after viewers accused them of glamorising his cause.

Emwazi was named last week and details about his family life and education in west London were uncovered by journalists.

On the day his identity emerged, the BBC broadcast live from a press conference by prisoner's rights group Cage for 52 minutes.

At the press conference, the group's leader Asim Qureshi called the masked killer 'a beautiful young man' and blamed security services for his actions.

The BBC said it had received 'some complaints from viewers and listeners who feel there has been too much coverage' of the story.

But a corporation spokesman said the story was 'globally significant' and the identification of Emwazi was 'an important development'.

He said: 'We have a responsibility to report the story as well as examine Emwazi's background and shed light on his radicalisation. We don't believe that our coverage has glamorised him or Islamic State.

'We have made it very clear that he appears to be responsible for a number of brutal killings, and is a member of a growing, well-armed, well-financed organisation that commits acts of brutality and is having a profound impact on the security of the Middle East.

'We feel BBC News has reported on the activities of Islamic State and Mohammed Emwazi in a clear and accurate manner.'
