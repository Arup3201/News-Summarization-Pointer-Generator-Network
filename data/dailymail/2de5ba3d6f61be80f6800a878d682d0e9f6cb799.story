A wounded veteran who lost three limbs during his service in Afghanistan has been presented with a $600,000 custom-built 'smart house' this morning in California on the 11th anniversary of 9/11.

Marine Corporal Juan Dominguez was gifted the keys to the Temecula house by Forest Gump and CSI: NY actor Gary Sinise, whose foundation helped raise the money to build the home for the soldier who was maimed in 2010 when he fell down a road-side bank onto an IED.

Fitted with an elevator and doors that are controlled by an iPad, Cpl. Dominguez's new home was covered in a 40ft by 30ft Stars and Stripes flag before it was unveiled in front of 100 Marines from the veteran's battalion at 6.59 a.m. - the exact moment the South Tower of the World Trade Center collapsed.

Moving into the home with his girlfriend Alexis and nine-year-old daughter Victoria, Cpl. Dominguez's high-tech new house is centrally located between his physical training in San Diego and his relatives who live in Los Angeles.

Injured in October of 2010, Dominguez has spent months undergoing multiple surgeries and therapy sessions to recover as much independent mobility as he possibly can.

The home is a gift of the Gary Sinise Foundation and the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation named for the FDNY firefighter who ran through the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel to the World Trade Center in Manhattan when his truck was denied entry on September 11th, 2001.

'I consider this foundation like part of my family,' said Dominguez, 28, to CNN.

'They've taken great care of me, with no strings attached, and I couldn't have asked for more.'

With low kitchen cabinets and shelves for easy access, Cpl. Dominguez will also have access to a pool which will be installed so that he can continue his recovery at home.

Having lost both his legs and an arm, Cpl. Dominguez is the third veteran to receive a home paid for by the two foundations and there are 19 more in the pipeline.

Paid for by donations from wealthy backers and from fund raising concerts given by Gary Sinise's Lt. Dan band, named for the double-amputee character he played in 1994's Oscar-winning Forest Gump, the homes are being built by Standard Pacific Homes.

'Our team has worked with our subcontractors and vendors to create an exceptional home for an extremely deserving American hero,' said Marty Langpap, Inland Empire division manager for Standard Pacific Homes.

In a poignant coincidence, the street names at the Reserve at Paseo del community in Temecula are named for the victims of the September 11 attacks.

The Forest Gump actor's foundation was founded in 2010 and was inspired by his family's deep roots in military service.The CSI: NY star's father served in the Navy in the 1950s and his two uncle's served during the Second World War.His three brothers-in-law served in Vietnam and his sister-in-law served for ten-years in the Army and rose to the rank of Captain.The actors nephew has served in Afghanistan and currently is a member of the Green Berets Special Forces Training program.

'Giving Juan a measure of his life back after all he has done, on the anniversary of the day our brother died, means the world to us,' said Frank Siller, chairman of the Tunnel to Towers Foundation and brother of Stephen Siller.

One of the special features in Cpl. Dominguez's new home is a music room equipped to allow him to continue playing the guitar and drums - which are his passions.

Indeed, the Marine and Sinise have played frequently together at Lt. Dan band concerts in California, as the two joined forces to help raise the $600,000 needed for his new home.

At the unveiling of Cpl. Dominguez's home a motorcade will be lined with 1,000 U.S. flags as his comrades march past to salute the veteran and his family.

Construction of the home began in May and a ceremony was held for the groundbreaking for which Academy Award winning actor Jon Voight attended calling Cpl. Dominguez and all veterans 'the true magnificents.'

'The outpouring of love and support in the community was inspiring and I am thrilled that I will be able to attend the event on Sept. 11 to present him with this smart home,' said Gary Sinise to the North County Times.

The character of 'Lieutenant Dan' provided Gary Sinise with an instantaneous and enduring connection with servicemen of all branches of the military and he undertook his first overseas tour for U.S. troops in June 2003, when he visited Iraq.

Admitting that most members of the public and the military simply call him Lt. Dan, Sinise formed his band named after the character in 2004 and have toured extensively, raising funds for veterans.
