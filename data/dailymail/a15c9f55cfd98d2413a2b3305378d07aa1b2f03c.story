Chris Sutton has urged Celtic to make Europa League progress a higher priority than four domestic league crowns in a row.

A key figure in the last Parkhead side to reach a European final in 2003, Sutton claimed the champions can afford to drop points in the Premiership – and still win the title.

Rating Europe’s second-tier competition as a chance to re-energise a season which has already witnessed two demoralising exits from the Champions League, however, the Englishman suggested his former club could go all the way and actually win the trophy.

‘Celtic, for me, should prioritise this Europa League campaign,’ said Sutton, as he promoted BT Sport’s live coverage of the opening game in Salzburg on Thursday night.

‘They can afford to drop points in the league, lose games and still win the league because they are far and away the best team in Scotland.

‘They would get a real shot in the arm from performing well in this competition. The Europa League has a totally new dimension now with the winners going straight into the Champions League. Why can’t it be Celtic?

‘Things change quickly in football. There is a bit of doom and gloom about the Champions League but that’s gone now. Celtic could win the treble and could go on a good run in the Europa League and go on and win it.

‘They have top players like Kris Commons and Scott Brown coming back and players who can grow. Celtic have good raw attributes – they just need to pull it all together.’

Sutton has been sceptical of the systems employed by coach Ronny Deila in a stuttering start to the season delivering just five wins in 11 competitive games.

But heartened by the additions of Stefan Scepovic, Wakaso Mubarak and Aleksandar Tonev - with John Guidetti only eligible for the knockout stages – Sutton believes Celtic now have the pace to make an impact.

‘There are things I haven’t understood about the Europa League and the mentality of clubs in England. They play the youth team and get knocked out. It doesn’t make any sense to me.

‘I think Celtic should really go for this campaign because they have everything to gain.

‘The first two games in this group stage are absolutely crucial. Salzburg have lost their last three, but that’s dangerous going into this because they have chucked a lot of money at their side and we all might think Celtic should go there and win, but it doesn’t work like that.

‘That might work against Celtic. But they can go there with confidence. The main thing is: “Don’t lose the game.”’

Sutton also cautioned against making snap judgements following an accusation by Aberdeen’s Shay Logan that Celtic winger Aleksandar Tonev aimed racist comments towards him during last Saturday’s game at Parkhead.

‘There isn’t any place for abuse of any level. It is up to the SFA to investigate it,’ said Sutton. ‘We’ve all been abused over the years and I am not saying it is right, but you get on with the game.

‘It is unsavoury but the SFA have to get to the bottom of it. You can’t hang Tonev yet because if it is proved he didn’t say it, then he didn’t say it. It’s jumping the gun a little bit. People jump to conclusions pretty quickly.’

Aberdeen confirmed yesterday that they have been asked for their version of events by the SFA as the governing body’s enquiries continue.

A statement read: ‘The club will co-operate fully with this investigation. As an employer we support unconditionally any employee who is the subject of any form of abuse and as such believe it is appropriate to allow the SFA the time necessary to carry out a full investigation.’

Celtic have already issued a denial on behalf of Bulgarian international Tonev.
