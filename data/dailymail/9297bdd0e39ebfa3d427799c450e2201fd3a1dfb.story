The mother of a British woman jailed for 12 years in the Caribbean for killing her husband in a car crash has vowed to overturn the ‘miscarriage of justice’.

Nicole Reyes, a former travel rep from Rumney, was yesterday handed the prison sentence after judges convicted her of the voluntary manslaughter of her husband Jorge on the island in July 2012.

Mrs Reyes, 38, was driving home from a night out in the Dominican Republic next to coconut water salesman Jorge when her car hit his motorbike, leaving him dead.

She insisted he had swerved to avoid 
an oncoming car and hit her by accident - but police in the Caribbean 
accused her of murder.

Her 
parents Jeannette and Mike Clements had flown out to the island for 
yesterday's two-and-a-half hour court hearing and called it a 
'miscarriage of justice'.

Mrs Clements, 62, said they will now appeal the ruling and will meet with their daughter's lawyers today.

She said the court yesterday heard from a police officer who she said told the judges that he could see it was an accident.

The
 grandmother said her daughter was allowed to speak about what happened, 
but was stopped when she tried to speak again later in the hearing.

Mrs Clements said she felt 'totally sick' when the sentence was announced.

She said: 'For someone to know their child was guilty would be bad enough but knowing she's innocent, it doesn't make sense.'

But she said her daughter remained calm and that after the hearing she was 'whisked off' back to the prison she described as a 'hell hole'.

She said: 'I honestly believed she was going to be set free.'

She said they feel their daughter did not receive a fair trial and have called on the UK Government for help.

Her parents said they fear for their daughter's health.

Mrs Clements said: 'I visited her in the prison on Saturday and she collapsed in my arms saying she was just so ill with so much pain in her stomach and back.'

She said they will now have to find the money to cover the legal fees for the appeal process and her continuing medical bills.

Mrs Reyes' daughter Leah said that she and her brother Luke were 'devastated' by the news.

Mrs
 Reyes first visited the island on holiday before taking a holiday rep 
job with Thomas Cook, where she met her husband, a coconut water 
salesman, in 2006.

They married in 2007 and had what was described as a happy relationship until the crash in July 2012.

Mrs Reyes was driving her sports utility vehicle next to the Yamaha 125 motorbike being ridden by her 38-year-old husband when the crash happened.

Police told Mrs Reyes they would take her to hospital - but took her straight to prison, it is claimed.

Mrs Reyes’ children who are both 18, have moved back to Britain to be with their grandparents and speak to their mother every day on the phone.

Leah said: 'We are heartbroken that mum is not going to be coming home but we will continue to fight in court and will appeal the decision.

'Twelve years is better than 30 years but for her to be in prison at all is pathetic because she has done nothing wrong.'

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office told MailOnline: 'We're aware that a British national, Nicole Reyes, has been detained in the Dominican Republic since July 2012.

'We are monitoring events closely and we continue to provide consular assistance to Ms Reyes and her family.'
