Record numbers of illegal migrants are being stopped at UK borders, it was revealed last night. Senior officials said 36,000 unlawful stowaways had been discovered since last April. 

Sir Charles Montgomery, the director general of the Border Force, said 30,000 were found by British officers at Calais, while 6,000 were detained on UK soil.

In 2013-14, the number caught was half that, at 18,000, he said.

Campaigners said the number who actually reached Britain was likely to be far higher, possibly in the hundreds of thousands. 

Sir Charles told the Home Affairs Select Committee it was not possible to stop all illegal migration. He said: ‘I cannot look this committee in the eye and say I can operate 100 per cent control so 100 per cent of clandestines will not get across the border.’ 

He confirmed that not a single person arriving by train or coach – some ten million – is so far counted in and out, or checked against criminal watchlists.

MPs on the committee warned holidaymakers could face huge queues at Eurotunnel and ferry ports when checks on passengers leaving Britain start on April 8.

Border chiefs have already pushed back the start date for the checks by one week to avoid introducing the new system over the busy Easter weekend.

Checks will involve operators recording passport information on all travellers and passing the details on to the Home Office, which will use the details to identify immigration offenders.

However, Sir Charles told MPs coach parties of children under 16 would be excluded to reduce delays.

He added: ‘The coach sector is the most difficult of all logistically and that has been the focus of trials and testing. We still have to refine the process to ensure it works as smoothly as possible. I’m confident we will have a solution come the live date.’ 

Calais is under pressure from more than 2,500 immigrants, many fleeing disasters in Africa and the Middle East. Often they are determined to reach the UK, attracted by work, free health care and generous benefits.

Many are ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado, according to Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart.

On October, a 16-year-old Ethiopian girl was killed when she was knocked down as she crossed the Channel Tunnel approach road.

Sniffer dogs, carbon dioxide detectors, heartbeat monitors and scanners are all used to find stowaways. Britain has also given £12million to the French to improve security measures, including a 9ft-high fence – dubbed the ‘ring of steel – which was used to protect world leaders attending the Nato summit in Wales in September.

But transport firms said that rather than deporting any captured stowaways back to their home countries, France is simply releasing them to have another go at breaching Britain’s borders.

Meanwhile, the Home Office announced a new independent immigration inspector to replace John Vine, who stepped down in December in ‘frustration’ at ministers’ attempts to ‘manipulate’ his reports about border chaos.

His successor is David Bolt, a former MI5 officer who also worked for the defunct Serious Organised Crime Agency.

Mr Bolt has been appointed to the £130,000-a-year job on a fixed term two-year contract, one year shorter than his predecessor.

He is currently chief executive of the International Federation of Spirits Producers, which combats international trade in counterfeit spirits.

Britain has also signed up to a new European database designed to stop foreign killers, terrorists and paedophiles entering the UK.

In a bid to tighten up Britain’s borders, the Government has finally negotiated access to the Second Generation Schengen Information System, known as ‘SIS II’, which has details of 250,000 wanted or missing people.

The system, used by 28 countries, will issue alerts about the most dangerous on-the-run criminals as well as suspected jihadists returning from Syria and Iraq, missing people and stolen goods.
