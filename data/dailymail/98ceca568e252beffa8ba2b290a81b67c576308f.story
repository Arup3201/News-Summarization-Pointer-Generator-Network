A jury has convicted a Mississippi man who was declared dead two decades ago only to resurface as a murder suspect.

Jurors took just over an hour Monday before finding Thomas Sanders guilty in the kidnapping and slaying of 12-year-old Lexis Roberts.

The penalty phase begins next week. Jurors will decide whether the 57-year-old Sanders will be put to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.

Back from the dead: Thomas Steven Sanders, who went missing in Mississippi in 1987 and declared dead in 1994, has been found guilty of the 2010 slaying of his girlfriend's 12-year-old daughter 

Murdered: Lexis Roberts, 10, of Las Vegas, was found dead off a dirt track in remote Louisiana woods on October 8, 2010. She had been and her throat was slit

Prosecutors concluded their case against Sanders on Friday. Defense lawyers called no witnesses after failing to get the case thrown out of federal court.

Roberts' skeletal remains were found off a gravel trail in rural Louisiana in October 2010. The body of her mother, Suellen Roberts, was found later in Arizona. Sanders confessed to killing both. 

Prosecutor Bill Flanagan said Sanders shot the girl's mother, Suellen Roberts, on a trip all three took to a wildlife park near the Grand Canyon, then drove Lexis Roberts to Louisiana, where he shot her four times and cut her throat.

Gibbens, who offered no explanation for the shootings called it 'a vacation that went terribly, horribly, sadly wrong'.

Sanders was identified as a suspect long after he was thought dead.

Sanders had left his family in Mississippi in 1987, and his relatives and ex-wife had him declared dead in 1994 after he had been missing for years.

A middle-aged, balding man, Sanders sat quietly with his lawyers as the killings were described, periodically wiping his eyes.  

Sanders was found guilty of both crimes: kidnapping resulting in death and using a firearm in a crime of violence that caused a person's death.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

During the case, witnesses described finding Lexis Roberts' remains on hunting property.

Photos of a skull with small pink braces still attached to the upper teeth were shown in court, along with a purple unicorn stuffed animal that was found in the woods near Roberts' bones.

Sanders' lawyers didn't dispute that the remains were identified as Lexis Roberts.

Flanagan said Sanders met Suellen Roberts while working and living at a storage facility in Las Vegas.

Within a few months, they started dating and planned the Labor Day weekend trip that would end with both mother and daughter shot and killed, the prosecutor said.

After visiting a wildlife refuge known as Bearizona and stopping at the Grand Canyon, the trio pulled into a remote stretch of desert off an interstate so Suellen Roberts could shoot Sanders' .22-caliber rifle, Flanagan said.

Instead, Sanders shot the mother in the head while her daughter sat on a blanket nearby, Flanagan said.

Sanders left the body where it fell and drove Lexis Roberts over several days to northeast Louisiana, where he shot her three times in the head and once in the chest, the prosecutor said.

'Lexis Roberts still had not died, and so he took his knife and he cut her throat,' Flanagan told jurors.

FBI agent Glen Kelly said Sanders confessed to the child's death after being arrested in Gulfport, Mississippi, while still in possession of Suellen Roberts' car.

'He said something to the effect of, ''I'm surprised it took you so long to find me'',' Kelly testified.

Gibbens said Sanders was in love with the mother.

She said he acknowledged: 'I just shot her. I didn't know what to do after that.'

Gibbens said that after learning how Lexis Roberts' body had decomposed in the woods, Sanders replied: 'She didn't deserve that.'
