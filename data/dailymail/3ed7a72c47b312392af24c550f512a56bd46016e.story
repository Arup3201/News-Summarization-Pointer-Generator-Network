'James Bond': Jonathan Hill, 43, trawled dating sites for women before telling them he worked for the secret service and asking them for money

A fraudster who posed as a James Bond-type character on dating websites before conning them out of tens of thousands of pounds has been jailed.

Jonathan Hill, 43, used popular dating sites including Plenty Of Fish and Match.com to make contact with women looking for love.

Hill, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, claimed that he worked undercover for the secret service and even asked one unsuspecting woman to sign 'The Official Secrets Act’ before asking for money to pay his mortgage.

Sheffield Crown Court heard that the father stole a total of £28,785 from four women.

Jurors were told that one of his victims remortgaged her house and resorted to payday loans firms to pay her bills after giving Hill more than £18,000.

Hill made contact with Debra Bates via the Freedating website in May 2013, and after cancelling several arranged dates they finally met in June, when he told her he worked undercover and would be away for long periods of time, prosecutor Kevin Jones told the court.

He told her she would have to sign ‘The Official Secrets Act’ before asking her for £3,000 to help pay his mortgage.

She transferred £500 to him initially, but later made several more money transfers to him totalling £18,025, Mr Jones said.

He added: 'From July to September she hoped that their relationship would develop and last.

'Ultimately she ended up having to take out payday loans to cover her own bills.'

In a victim impact statement read to the court the woman said: 'He charmed me into his way of thinking. I was waiting for 'my boyfriend' to come home.'

Mr Jones added: 'This victim lost just over £18,000. She now struggles to let people into her life. She says this has affected the relationship with her own family.

'She remortgaged her house, which has resulted in extra payments and an increased term.'

Another victim was a member of Match.com, and after they made contact Hill conned her out of £880, jurors heard.

Mr Jones said: 'As time moved on, he alluded to being in the special services or undercover in the prison service.

Plenty of Fish: Hill, from Doncaster, found his victims online, using dating websites including Plenty of Fish

The serial conman, who also used Match.com, stole a total of £28,785 from four women, jurors were told

'He said he worked undercover all over the country.

'In February 2013 he asked for money. She initially refused but she transferred £880.'

Another victim was a member of dating site Plenty Of Fish.

The court heard she was having a difficult time at work and Hill was being ‘helpful and understanding’ when they made contact in March 2013.

In August 2013 he asked for money and she eventually gave him £3,180.

Robert Sandford, defending, said Hill’s actions had ‘coincided with his redundancy and financial pressures’, and said his girlfriend of eight years was standing by him.

Hill was sentenced to three years in jail after he admitted five counts of fraud.

Judge Robert Moore said: 'For two years you set out to find gullible females on the internet dating system.

'They needed love, you needed money, but pretended to give them love.

'It is clear you will have left these four ladies with long-lasting effects on their feelings of confidence and trust.

'Only an immediate and substantial custodial sentence can be justified.'
