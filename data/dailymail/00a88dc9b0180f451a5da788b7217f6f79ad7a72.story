It could, perhaps, be described as a case of 'a bridge too fast'.  

The world's longest pedestrian suspension bridge - the SkyBridge near the city of Sochi in south-western Russia - stretches for almost a kilometre over the Krasnaya Polyana valley.

This vast structure can cope with up to 30,000 people at a time.

Preparing for the drop: Brave souls can bungee-jump from the SkyBridge, near Sochi in south-western Russia

And for daring tourists, there is more to its appeal than simply its length.

Bungee-jumpers can opt for 650ft of freefall if they hurl themselves off a viewing platform into the valley below.

Extreme sports fans who have not had enough highs for one day can also speed along a zip wire more than 500ft above the valley floor.

This is known as the 'Trollwire'.

A nice place for a stroll: Even if you don't fancy throwing yourself off the bridge, you can just enjoy the views

Riders are strapped to a zipwire together, clipped in horizontally side by side.

The ride reaches speeds of 70mph as it swoops through the air.

The Skypark AJ Hackett has already successfully applied to the Guinness World Records for the site to be recognised as the longest suspension footbridge in the world.

Quite the feat of construction: The bridge stretches across its wide chasm for the best part of a kilometre

Spokesman Vladislav Baranov says: 'Parts of the skypark are still under construction, but we want this to be the highest, fastest, most fun park in the world.'

He adds: 'There are two heights of bungee in case people don't feel brave enough to go all the way down from the top.

Do we have to jump? We're quite happy up here: A crowd gathers to admire the impressive spectacle

'But just to come for the bridge, and the views will take your breath away.'

One visitor, Lima Uvarova, said: 'I was going to go on the high bungee but wimped out.

'I'm definitely doing it next time. The views are amazing.'
