Thousands of English and Welsh students will be able to claim free tuition at Scottish universities by claiming Irish grandparents, it was revealed today.

Last week, it emerged that students from Northern Ireland could avoid fees by taking dual Republic of Ireland citizenship and applying as EU students, which would result in them having their fees paid under European equality law.

The Scottish Government played down the development, saying it would only apply to a small number of students.

But it has now emerged that anyone who lives in the UK who has an Irish grandparent can obtain an Irish passport and apply under the same loophole.

Nearly 625,000 people living in England and Wales claimed Irish ethnicity in the 2001 census – and as many as six million across the UK are estimated to have at least one Irish grandparent.

In some cases, even UK residents with an Irish great-grandparent could apply for an Irish passport.

The children and grandchildren of people of other EU nationalities living in England and Wales could also use the same loophole.

Under
new legislation, students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland 
should pay fees of up to £9,000 a year to attend Scots universities, 
while Scots students study for free.

But the loophole raises the prospect of a flood of applicants from around the UK.

The development may mean greater competition for university places in Scotland.

There may also be disadvantages for 
students applying under the EU route, with a legal question mark over 
whether their nationality takes precedence over where they live.

A legal loophole could allow students from England and Wales who have Irish grandparents or parents to apply for Republic of Ireland citizenship and then apply to study in Scotland as EU students, which would result in their university fees being paid under European equality law.

So how can English or Welsh students with Irish heritage go about this?

According to the Embassy of Ireland website, if you were born outside of Ireland, and one or both of your parents were born in Ireland, then you are automatically an Irish citizen from birth and can apply directly to the Irish Passport Office in London for an Irish passport.

Whereas if you have a grandparent who was born on in Ireland, but both you and your parents were born outside Ireland, you can claim Irish citizenship through your Irish-born grandparent through Foreign Births Registration.

If your parent has already become an Irish citizen through Foreign Births Registration before you were born, you are entitled to claim Irish citizenship through them.

Once you have gained Irish citizenship, you can then apply to study for free through UCAS at a Scottish University as a non-UK EU student using your Irish nationality.

There is also the possibility of receiving extra help with living costs for some degree courses by applying as an EU national to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.

Last
night, a spokesman for Universities Scotland, which represents 
principals, said: ‘Based on the most recent statistics available, there 
is no indication that Scotland’s universities have seen a rise in 
applicants holding an Irish passport.

‘Universities Scotland continues to seek clarity from the Government on this issue.’

Gordon Watson, president of the University and College Union Scotland, which represents lecturers, said: ‘Those with a dual European passport will compete with Scottish students for the capped number of places in clearing and a huge rise in such applications is likely next year.

‘This shows the introduction of fees for UK students outside Scotland will play havoc with the admissions process as universities try to maximise student intake from the diminishing number of UK students who will pay fees.’

Robin Parker, president of NUS Scotland, said: ‘We must see clarity on this issue so students can make an informed choice about what places are available and what support they will be able to receive.’

A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘Students who hold dual UK and EU nationality have been able to apply for fee support as non-UK EU nationals at Scottish universities for a number of years, but there is no evidence to suggest this has ever happened on a significant scale or that it is likely to.

‘Eligibility for claiming nationality varies by state and it is for the student to prove they hold EU nationality before the relevant date. We closely monitor application trends and are prepared to act if it appears that issues such as this are arising.

‘We are also exploring the introduction of an EU management fee, within the bounds of EU law.’

‘We continue to seek clarity.'
