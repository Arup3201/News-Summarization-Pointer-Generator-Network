A tense standoff between a gunman and police ended on Wednesday night after he gave himself up and released his two female hostages.

The 45-year-old gunman had barricaded himself in a home in Inglewood, California from early afternoon, holding his girlfriend and daughter captive.

The man, who had a criminal record, injured two police officers earlier in the day. Both are recovering in hospital with one of the officers hit in the chest while wearing a protective vest.

Following hours of hostage negotiations, the man came out of the house at about 9.30pm  and was taken into custody with SWAT teams tightly circled around the suburban neighborhood.

'We are treating it as it hostage situation... There may be additional people inside the residence. It’s unsure at this time how many additional people could be inside.'

One witness told the TV station that earlier the girl had tried to run from the home but was pulled back inside by the man. 

The 911 call which brought police to the neighborhood was reported to have been made inside the house.

SWAT teams surrounded the area as residents were warned to stay indoors until they were evacuated. A nursery school was also evacuated earlier today.
