Two Utah men already facing possible criminal charges for purposely toppling an ancient rock formation in a state park have now been removed from their posts as Boy Scout leaders.

A northern Utah Boy Scouts council announced Monday that Glenn Taylor and Dave Hall will no longer be allowed to lead scouting troops due to what happened October 11 at Goblin Valley State Park, which they filmed and posted on Facebook.

In another twist, one of the men has links with convicted killer Jodi Arias and appeared on HLN throughout her trial.

Connection: Dave Hall was a close friend of murdered man Travis Alexander

Dave Hall was a close friend of victim Travis Alexander and spoke about his mistrust of the woman who was eventually convicted for stabbing him 29 times, shooting him in the face and slitting his throat.

'There was just something really weird about [Jodi Arias], and when she spent time with you, you even got more creeped out,' Hall told HLN’s Nancy Grace in January.

'Just the way she acted in our home. The way that she had this awkward silence about her. The way that she just had no soul. You could almost see through her. It’s not someone you could sit down with and have a conversation. She was very mysterious.'

Hall is currently under investigation by police for his part in the topping of a 170 million-year-old rock formation.

The move by the Boy Scouts' Utah 
chapter comes on the heels of the national Boy Scouts of America 
condemning the men's actions last week and promising a review of the 
incident.

The Boy Scouts' Utah National Parks 
Council posted a statement on its website saying the men's actions are 
not in line with the principles the organization teaches about 
preserving nature.

'We encourage all leaders and Scouts 
to review the "Leave No Trace" principles, as we are all a part of 
maintaining the integrity, character and the natural beauty of the 
outdoors for all living things,' the statement said.

The rock formation they toppled over 
is about 170 million years old, Utah State Parks spokesman Eugene 
Swalberg said. The central Utah park is dotted with thousands of the 
eerie, mushroom-shaped sandstone formations.

Hall and Taylor came under fire last 
week after posting a video on Facebook where Taylor can be seen wedging 
himself between a formation and a boulder to knock a large rock off the 
formation's top. Taylor and his two companions can then be seen 
cheering, high-fiving and dancing.

They said the rock formation was 
loose and they feared it was dangerous. They were leading a group of 
teenage Boy Scouts on a trip when it happened.

Hall said they found out about losing
 their Boy Scouts positions Monday morning. They had been troop leaders 
for a few years, Hall said, and hope to continue to be involved in 
organization in the future using what happened as a teaching point. Both
 men are from Highland, Utah, about 30 miles south of Salt Lake City.

'We've always supported the Boy Scouts and if that's what they feel is best, we support that decision,' Hall said.

'We're extremely sorry for our mistake. We look forward to doing everything we can to make it right and move on.'

Utah State Parks authorities are 
conducting a criminal investigation, and the Emery County Attorney's 
Office also is reviewing the incident to determine if charges should be 
filed.

Speaking to the Salt Lake Tribune, Mr Hall said he has received dozen of death threats in the past week.

'I’ve got over 100 death threats on the Internet already,' said Mr Hall.

'I’ve
 got people all over the world telling me they are going to kill me 
because I made the decision that lives are more important than this rock
 staying here a few more hours,' he added.

Despite 
attracting possible criminal charges and the continuing hatred of people
 across the globe, Mr Hall continued to defend his group's actions.

'I think we made the right decision, but probably the wrong method,' he explained
 to the Tribune. 'we take full responsibility for whatever mistake we 
made, and we’re open to whatever that means from the state, from the Boy
 Scouts’ office, etc.'

The rock formations at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah are thousands of years old, formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock

A criminal investigation is now underway in the incident, which occurred on October 11, spokesman Eugene Swalberg told the Tribune.

'It
 is not only wrong, but there will
 be consequences,' he said. 'This is highly, highly inappropriate. This 
is not what you do at state parks. It’s disturbing and upsetting.'

Deputy Emery County Attorney 
Brent Langston said he was aware of the incident but that it has not yet
 reached his office. If it does, he will consider whether to bring 
charges.

He said they could
 face anywhere from a 
class B misdemeanor (up to six months in prison) to a second-degree 
felony (one to 15 years in prison) depending on how much the 
formation is valued, the Tribune reported.

He added: 'Some things can’t be replaced, like photographs in a family album, but they have great sentimental value.'

But the men insist that they only pushed the rock to the ground because it was unstable and they were concerned about it crushing a child playing nearby.

On the video, Hall says: 'Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it’s all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley.'

Taylor said he had seen a family walk close to the rock and when he touched it, it was loose.

'I put my hand on a rock and it moved,' 
he said. 'While we were sitting right there we thought, "Man if this 
rock falls it’ll kill them".' I didn’t have to push hard.'

But when they left, he said he thought that he probably should have contacted a ranger before taking action. But the men said they had only seen one in the park that day.

Still, they apologized for their actions and said they wish they could have dealt with it differently.

'Glad we did it, wish we wouldn’t have done it,' Glenn Taylor said.

Hall added: 'We're extremely sorry for 
our actions. There was no in way shape or form any intent to go out 
there and cause any harm to our natural resources.'

Swalbery added that seeing a loose rock does not mean a person should push it over.

Glenn Taylor and Hall are leaders for the local Boy Scouts troop and that they are also Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints youth leaders.

They said authorities have not yet contacted them about the incident.
