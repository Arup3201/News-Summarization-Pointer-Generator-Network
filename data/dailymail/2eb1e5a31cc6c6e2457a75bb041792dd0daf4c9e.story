Home favourite Brian Harman was one of four Americans at the top of a crowded leaderboard after the first round of the McGladrey Classic in Georgia.

Harman lives in Sea Island and looked to be enjoying some home comforts as he shot a five-under-par 65 to share the lead with Michael Thompson, Erik Compton and Will MacKenzie.

The 27-year-old won his first PGA Tour tournament at the John Deere Classic in July and, after not playing the opening two events of the season, was glad to be back in action.

Brian Harman leads the McGladrey Classic

'I was nervous starting,' he told www.pgatour.com. 'It has been a while since I played a golf tournament. I took the first two tournaments off because I wasn't quite ready to go so I wasn't quite sure how things were going to go.

'It was windy, it was cold this morning, it was tough conditions and I just outlasted it and finally started getting comfortable and playing better and finished real nice.'

Starting on the back nine, Harman bogeyed 14 but followed that with two birdies and reached the turn in 34.

The birdies were coming in bunches and Harman picked up further shots on three, four, seven and eight to get off to a good start in a season that will see him make his Masters debut at Augusta in April.

'After you win, you kind of feel invincible for a little while and feel like you ought to win every week but it just doesn't turn out, there are so many factors that go into it,' he said.

'So work hard, see what happens, do your best and stay patient. That's what I'm trying to do.'

Fellow University of Georgia alumni Compton also carded six birdies and a bogey to hold a share of the lead and Thompson's scorecard also showed just the one dropped shot.

'If you get it going the greens are really quick and they're very true,' said Compton. 'So if you're playing well I think there's some good scores out there.

'Conditions I think will definitely get tighter during the week and (these are) definitely the fastest greens we've putted on in a while so you've got to be careful.'

MacKenzie registered his seventh birdie of the day on the ninth - his last - to join the other three, with a double-bogey on 16 robbing him of the outright lead.

There was then a group of eight players a further shot back including last season's Rookie of the Year Chesson Hadley, while Ryder Cup players Webb Simpson and Matt Kuchar were on three under.

Scot Martin Laird was a further shot adrift on two under with three-time major winner Padraig Harrington and England's Brian Davis on one over and another Scot, Russell Knox, just one off the bottom on six over.

Mark Anderson played the shot of the day as he lit up his level-par 70 with a hole-in-one on the par-three third.
