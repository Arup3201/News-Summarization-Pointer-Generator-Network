It prompted fears of a highly-calculated terror plot.

But in fact, the 33-foot-long bunker built under one of Toronto's most important tourist attractions was 'just a place to hang out', according to its architect.

Elton McDonald, 22, has finally unveiled himself as the man behind the mysterious tunnel which took five years to construct.

And his pursuits were far from cunning.

Just for fun! Construction worker Elton McDonald, 22, says he built the underground bunker to watch TV in

Fears: Investigators first thought the 33-foot-long tunnel underneath Toronto could be part of a terror plot

'Innocent': McDonald says he and a friend spent five years constructing the wood-paneled space underground

'It wasn't really a tunnel. I was going to expand it to have a couple of rooms,' McDonald, a construction worker, told the Toronto Sun newspaper.

'I was hoping to put in a TV. I did some barbecuing in there. It was more a place to hang out.'

Police ignited a frenzy of media speculation in February by announcing the discovery of a 'sophisticated' hand-dug tunnel near a tennis stadium to be used for the Pan Am Games in July. 

Much of the speculation was linked to concern about a terrorist plot against the Games.

McDonald said he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about it so they understood why he was always so dirty

McDonald says he had grand plans to add rooms to the underground 'hang out' space in Toronto

Days later, police said they had identified two men who had built the  tunnel but declined to reveal their identities since no crime had been committed.

McDonald told the newspaper he'd begun working in construction at age 17 and considered it a fun challenge to dig the hideout with several friends. He told his family about the project so they would understand why he came home so dirty.

When news broke about the tunnel, McDonald said he didn't speak up because he was afraid he'd be in trouble.

Police tracked him down after his employer recognized some of the equipment used at the site, McDonald said.

Suspicious: Police were baffled to find a rosary and poppy on the door but McDonald says it was a gift

Investigation: Police launched a large-scale investigation into the bunker when it was discovered in January

The tunnel was discovered January 14 in a suburban woodlot. 

Reinforced with wooden walls and ceiling supports, it had electricity supplied by a generator, a sump pump to remove water and a pulley system to remove dirt.

Police found a rosary with crucifix and a poppy nailed to one of the tunnel's wooden supports. 

McDonald said his sister gave him the crucifix for good luck after a small cave-in, while he'd found the poppy on Remembrance Day, November 11, when war veterans are honored.

Canada has been on heightened alert for terrorist activity since a gunman attacked the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in October after fatally shooting a soldier at the nearby National War Memorial. 

The attack by a so-called 'lone wolf' Canadian convert to Islam came two days after another convert rammed two soldiers in Quebec with his car, killing one.
