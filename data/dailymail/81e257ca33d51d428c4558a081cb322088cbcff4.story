Four death sentences handed out the murderers in the infamous Delhi gang rape case have been upheld by an Indian court.

A
 two-judge bench ruled the crime qualified as 'the rarest of rare,' and 
so merited the death sentence, A.P. Singh, who represented two of the 
convicts, said.

Mukesh Singh, 26, Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, and Pawan Gupta, 19, were sentenced to death in September last year.

They were found guilty of the rape of 
Jyoti Singh, 23, after she boarded a bus with her friend on December 16,
 2012. She later died of her injuries.

The
 assault, carried out with a metal rod, transfixed India with its brutality and led to nationwide 
protests calling for better policing and harsher punishments for violent
 crimes against women.

In 
response, India’s Parliament passed legislation raising the maximum 
punishment for rape from life imprisonment to the death penalty, as well
 as criminalising offenses such as stalking and voyeurism.

Women’s
 rights advocates say public discussion in the aftermath of the crime 
chipped away at the stigma associated with sex crimes, as well as the 
way some victims of assaults perceived themselves.

In
 Delhi alone for instance, more than 1,500 rapes were reported in 2013 –
 the highest in over a decade – and up from 706 in 2012.

Harassment
 reports jumped fivefold from the 2012 figure. Delhi police say the 
increase isn’t due to rising crime rates, but to women’s new-found 
willingness to report abuse.

Justice
 Reva Khetrapal and Justice Pratibha Rani announced the verdict today at
 the Delhi High Court but the defence said they will now appeal in the 
Supreme Court.

Jyoti's 
friend, Awnindra Pandey, 28, who was with her that night, said today: 'I
 was waiting for this judgement and thankfully the court has delivered.

'People
 are congratulating and calling me to tell me about the judgement. I'm 
very happy that the court has upheld the death sentence. I want them 
hanged as soon as possible.'

However,
 Awnindra is still disappointed that this and many other rape cases in 
India are taking so long to get through the judicial system.

He
 added: 'I have one complaint against our judicial system. The case has 
become a landmark case in our country and the whole world is watching 
the pace in which justice is being done.

'The defence has already said they'll be appealing to the Supreme Court so I hope they move fast and not delay.

'Delaying
 it will deny justice to Jyoti, her family, me and the convicts. The 
more they delay the more affect it will have on us all mentally.

'The
 defence lawyer said that justice has not been done. Our judicial system
 gives him every right to put forth his side, but I have only one thing 
to tell him 'truth always prevails'.

'If Jyoti is watching, which I am sure she is, she will get peace after this judgement.'

A 1980 Supreme Court ruling allowed the death penalty in murder cases 
where the 'collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it 
will expect the holders of the judicial power to inflict death penalty.'
