Kalpesh Patel could be forgiven for making a snap decision not to take a shower.

After entering the bathroom of his home in western Indian the 41-year-old discovered a five-foot long crocodile had beaten him to it, and had taken up residence under his shower taps.

Mr Patel said: 'At first I didn't even know if it was alive, I just stood there staring at it in my bath robe and then suddenly I saw it blink, and I turned round and ran off as fast as I could – slamming the door behind me.'

Kalpesh Patel ran from the bathroom of his home in the Sojitra village, in Gujarat, after finding this crocodile on his shower floor

He said when he told his wife and 
children not to go in the bathroom because there was a reptile there, 
not surprisingly, they didn't believe him.

So Mr Patel got his neighbours at Sojitra village, Gujarat, located about 80 kilometres from the city of Ahmedabad, to take a look, and they confirmed the find.

Mr Patel said he had no idea how the crocodile got into his home, 'but we weren't prepared to let it out again'.

The police were called and forestry officials then captured the crocodile.

The crocodile was found in the shower of a family home at Sojitra village in Gujarat, India

Mr Patel said: 'The last I saw was them taking it away in a cage.'  

Police said that the crocodile had been transported to a lake in the nearby Malataj village of Anand district where it had been released unharmed.

Although Mr Patel's crocodile sighting was initially treated with scepticism, this photo taken at the scene and posted online, shows he really did have a reason to run from his bathroom.
