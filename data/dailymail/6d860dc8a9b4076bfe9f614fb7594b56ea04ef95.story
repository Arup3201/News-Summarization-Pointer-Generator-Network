A hedge fund ‘superstar’ is converting a £3million mews house into a new gym and garage - for his neighbouring home.

Chris Rokos, who is said to have a £200million fortune, bought the 19th century building in South Kensington, London, three years ago but started work on the property in 2013.

The 44-year-old now wants to replace the former coach house with a fitness suite and ‘cardio area’ as part of a basement gym with a garage large enough for two large vehicles at road level.

Star hedge fund manager Chris Rokos is converting a £3million mews house (pictured behind scaffolding) – so he can build a new garage and gym for his neighbouring home

The development will be completed accommodation for visitors and staff first floor for staff working at his home, which backs on to the site.

According to plans lodged with Kensington and Chelsea council, the two buildings will be linked with a basement corridor. 

His home is a three-storey, five-bedroom flat in a large town house.

The Standard reports that Mr Rokos paid £5.175million for one flat in the building six years ago and £2.475million for another shortly after and converted them into a single home.

The plans were given the green light by planning inspector Neil Pope last summer following an appeal after the initial proposals were turned down by the council.

But the proposals have run into opposition from some locals and the Standard quotes one neighbour as saying: ‘You don’t really expect that kind of development on a small mews street.’

Another local is reported as saying: ‘He has made himself rather unpopular here as he is only going to use it as a back entrance, but we’ve had all this disruption.’

But a spokesman for Mr Rokos tonight told MailOnline that the building was being 'meticulously' restored and residents would not notice a difference from the exterior once the project is complete.

The spokesman said: 'It is being meticulously restored with an unchanged façade. Nobody from the outside is going to notice any difference whatsoever apart from that the metal doors will be replaced by wooden doors.'

Reuters reports that ‘star trader’ Mr Rokos made about $4billion between 2004 and 2012 for the hedge fund Brevan Howard which accounted for about 17 per cent of the firm’s profits during thatv time.

The Standard reports that Mr Rokos was unavailable for comment.
