Americans are reading more ebooks than ever before - but also more print books, it has been revealed.

28% of Americans read at least one e-book in 2013 up from 23% the year earlier, according to a new survey of more than 1,000 adults from the Pew Research Centre.

However, it found the percentage of people who read print books increased as well with 69% telling the researchers they had read at least one print book, a rise of 4% from the previous year.

The rise of the e-reader: The Pew study found ebook sales at record levels - but also that print books are continuing to sell well

'Though e-books are rising in popularity, print remains the foundation of Americans’ reading habits. Most people who read e-books also read print books, and just 4% of readers are “e-book only,' the study's authors said.

Audiobook listeners have the most diverse reading habits overall, while fewer print readers consume books in other formats.

'Overall, 50% of Americans now have a dedicated handheld device–either a tablet computer like an iPad, or an e-reader such as a Kindle or Nook–for reading e-content,' the center said.

'That figure has grown from 43% of adults who had either of those devices in September.'

A new lease of life: Research found that print books were still selling well - and have risen

Based on interviews conducted earlier this month, the study shows 50 percent of respondents saying they have a tablet or stand-alone device such as Amazon.com's Kindle, up from 43 percent in September.

However, only around 4 percent read e-books exclusively.

Sales for e-books are growing, but have leveled off over the past couple of years.

They're believed to comprise 25 to 30 percent of the general trade market, with commercial fiction especially popular for e-books.

Ebook sales are at record levels, new research which found 50 per cent of respondents now own a tablet or ereader has found.

'The proportion of Americans who read e-books is growing, but few have completely replaced print books for electronic versions,' said Pew.

The percentage of adults who read an e-book in the past year has risen to 28%, up from 23% at the end of 2012.

At the same time, about seven in ten Americans reported reading a book in print, up four percentage points after a slight dip in 2012, and 14% of adults listened to an audiobook.

E-books are more popular than ever, according to a new survey by Pew Research Center -but print books still reign supreme, even among the younger "digital natives"
