Dozens of angry Filipinos gathered outside a military base where a young American soldier is being held accused of murdering a transgender woman, in a protest which ended in the victim's family scaling the fence

The boyfriend and sister of Jennifer Laude, 26, climbed into the military base in Manila, demanding to see the teenage U.S. Marine accused of her murder.

Earlier this week,  the U.S. military turned over Marine Pfc. Joseph Scott Pemberton, 19, from New Bedford, Massachusetts, to the Philippine military's main camp.

However, Jennifer Laude's family have expressed their anger at Pemberton being guarded by U.S. forces at the base and yesterday gathered outside the base, demanding proof that the teenage marine was really kept there.

Marilou Laude, the sister of Jennifer, who was born Jefferey, climbed over the fence and into the base and was swiftly captured by guards.

Jennifer Laude's German boyfriend Marc Susselbeck also jumped over the fence, and was seen pushing an army guard.

Laude, who was born Jeffrey, was found dead in a hotel in Olongapo City, around two hours drive from Manila, on October 11.

Eyewitnesses say Pemberton met her in a nightclub and didn't know she was transgender until they were in a hotel room.

Laude, who was said to have been unemployed and living off a monthly allowance from Susselbeck, was later found strangled to death there, her head in a toilet bowl.

Pemberton was detained on board the USS Peleliu at the Subic Bay Freeport, about 50 miles northwest of Manila, after he was implicated in the death.  

Pemberton's transfer by helicopter to Manila early Wednesday was agreed by the U.S. and the Philippines, Philippine military chief of staff Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang told a news conference. 

He said that Pemberton will be detained in an air-conditioned van, directly guarded by U.S. Marines while Philippine military guards will be posted outside the compound, he said.

'They agreed to put him in a facility which will pass U.S. custodial standards,' Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin said.

'We're happy with this because he's a suspect in a crime that was committed in our country.'

Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, who has described Laude's death as tragic, said that the arrangement showed 'mechanisms are in place so that justice can be served,' adding there was strong cooperation between the treaty allies.

Philippine and U.S. authorities engaged in a high-profile custody battle over another U.S. Marine, Daniel Smith, who was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison on charges of raping a Filipino woman after a night of drinking in 2005, also at the Subic freeport.

Smith was held at the U.S. Embassy in Manila until a Philippine appeals court overturned his conviction in 2009, allowing him to leave the country amid anti-U.S. protests.

In the latest case, Philippine police and witnesses said Pemberton and Laude met at a bar in the city of Olongapo on October 11, then went to a hotelroom where Laude's body was later found in the bathroom.

She had apparently been drowned in the toilet bowl, according to police Chief Inspector Gil Domingo.

U.S. Pacific Commander Adm. Samuel Locklear has ordered Pemberton's amphibious assault ship, which joined large-scale combat exercises with Filipino forces that ended October 10, to stay in the Philippines until the investigation was completed.

Under the Visiting Forces Agreement, which allows U.S. forces to conduct combat drills in the country, the Philippines can prosecute American service members, but the U.S. has custody over them 'from the commission of the offense until completion of all judicial proceedings.'

The Philippine Supreme Court, however, ruled in 2009 that convicted U.S. military personnel must serve any sentence in Philippine detention.

Left-wing activists and nationalist Filipinos have cited the custody provision as proof that the accord was lopsided in favor of the U.S. and undermines the sovereignty of the country, which was an American colony until 1946.

Left-wing groups have staged small protests at the U.S. Embassy in Manila and at the Subic wharf where the USS Peleliu is moored, demanding Washington to turn over Pemberton to Philippine authorities for prosecution and detention and calling for the 1998 agreement's abrogation.

President Benigno Aquino III on Monday defended the agreement, saying a crime can happen anywhere and 'the sin of one person' should not reflect on the entire country.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that Washington seeks no special privilege for the suspect but only protection of his rights.
