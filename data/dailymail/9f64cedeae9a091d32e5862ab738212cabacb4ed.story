A man desperately searching for a kidney donor for his wife has still not found a match after a year of wandering the streets looking for a stranger who might be willing to donate.

Larry Swilling, from South Carolina, made headlines last September when he walked 250 miles wearing a sandwich board with the message 'NEED KIDNEY 4 WIFE'.

While a number of kind-hearted donors have offered to help, none of them has yet provided a match and his wife Jimmie Sue remains on dialysis.

Loyal husband: Larry Swilling's devotion to his wife led him to walk the streets with a signboard asking for an organ donor

In need: Larry has taken his cause across the community in search of a donor match for his wife

Mr Swilling, 78, has received calls 
from as far away as Sweden and Egypt, but the difficulties of organ 
donation mean that the saga of his wife's health is not yet over.

Mrs Swilling, 76, was born with just 
one kidney, and ever since it started failing last year she has been 
looking for a replacement.

'I've had calls from miles around,' Mr Swilling told the Daily News. 'I've had calls from Egypt, Sweden, all over.'

He has carried on working at a construction firm to support the couple and help pay for his wife's medication.

in sickness and in health: Jimmie Sue, left, was born with only one kidney but now she needs a transplant

'She's my everything,' he told Fox News. 'We've been married 57 years. She's my life.'

Despite the debilitating effects of 
dialysis, Mrs Swilling is in generally good health, and doctors say that
a successful kidney transplant could bring an end to her medical 
problems.

However, staff at the Medical 
University of South Carolina say that finding a suitable donor has been 
difficult despite the positive reaction to Mrs Swilling's story.

'Finding a match is a huge, huge 
process,' nurse Sara Parker told Fox News. 'There's so many different 
components and several things can rule you out along the way.

'There's blood and tissue that you 
have to match. And it has to be a very healthy person who can go through
the surgery and live on one kidney post-operatively.'

Donor: As her loving husband, Larry was tested but was not found to be a donor match for his wife

At any cost: Larry told CBS News that he can't imagine life without his wife and he will do anything to find her a kidney

Mr Swilling had been hoping to donate a
kidney to his wife himself, but neither he nor any of their three 
children have the right blood type.

'She's my heart,' he told CBS News last year about his quest to find an organ donor for his wife.

Jimmie Sue is on a donor list but that could take as long as three years.

In
a last ditch effort, he decided to plead with strangers for help. 'I 
don't care what people think,' he said, telling his wife 'I'm going to 
get you a kidney.'

Help: Larry walks with his signboard across the community to broadcast his need

One mission: Larry says he doesn't care what people think of him asking strangers for help

He has taken to the sidewalks and streets of his hometown of Anderson and has even traveled to neighboring communities.

Wearing a signboard that reads 'Need Kidney 4 Wife,' he walks up and down busy streets to see if anyone would help.

'If I get a kidney, fine. If I don't, I hope someone else does,' Mrs Swilling said.

Donations are being collected for a fund to help the Swillings.

Interested organ donors who are willing to see if they could be a match for Mrs Swilling can contact the Medical University of South Carolina Transplant Center: 1-800-277-8687.
