When it comes to producing classic films, it seems that Britain really has it licked.

Scenes from silver screen classics such as Lawrence Of Arabia and Chariots Of Fire will be featured on a new series of Royal Mail stamps celebrating British film.

More recent classics have also been selected by a host of movie experts, film historians and the public, including Bend It Like Beckham starring Keira Knightley.

The earliest in the set  - which will be printed today - is the 1946 film A Matter Of Life And Death.

The classic starred David Niven as an airman who is caught in limbo between the real world and heaven.

Also included are scenes from 2001: A Space Odyssey and Mike Leigh's film Secrets & Lies, as well as an additional four films included on a miniature sheet focusing on the work of the GPO film unit which created documentaries, animations and information films in the 1930s and 1940s.

Among the films included is Night Mail, produced in 1936, featuring the verse of WH Auden and the music of Benjamin Britten and celebrating the nightly post train from Euston to Glasgow.

Lawrence Of Arabia star Peter O'Toole agreed to appear on the stamp shortly before his death last year.

His daughter Kate O'Toole said: 'Lawrence Of Arabia has stood the test of time and still remains a firm favourite in the hearts of film lovers everywhere. The stamp is a wonderful tribute to my father - and, of course, the film."

Nigel Havers, who played Lord Andrew Lindsay in Chariots Of Fire, said: 'It was great to be part of such an iconic film and the essence of the film has been captured with the image used.

'I will make sure I use the stamp on every letter I send in future.'

Royal Mail spokesman Andrew Hammond said: 'This stamp issue takes in landmark films, epics and influential movies that evoke the distinctiveness and quality of British film and story-telling across key genres.

'We hope they are enjoyed by anyone who has a love of great British film-making at its very best.'
