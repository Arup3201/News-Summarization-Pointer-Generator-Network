A schoolboy has been hailed a hero after he saved his diabetic mother’s life.

Kieran Carroll, seven, made sure his two-year-old brother, Layton, did not panic before calling for help when his mother, Rebecca Carroll, collapsed.

Ms Carroll, who has Type 1 diabetes, was at home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with her sons when her blood sugar level plummeted causing her to collapse.

Ms Carroll, 30, said: ‘I’d just come out of hospital after suffering from a viral infection and so my blood sugar was a bit all over the place.

‘I was on my own with the boys at home, and when I could feel my blood sugar dipping, I had a chocolate bar and a drink to try and stabilise it.

‘But the next thing I knew I was waking up and everyone was standing around me. Two of my neighbours were there and half of my family were all staring at me.’

Ms Carroll and her partner Mark Wood, 34, have taught Kieran what to do if he cannot wake his mother up.

‘We have always told him that if ever he can’t wake me, he needs to call for help,’ Ms Carroll said.

‘He knows how to use my iPhone and he can find the numbers for various family members.

When his mother collapsed, Kieran (centre) walked across a busy road with his brother to find his neighbours, Sunil Nadkar (left) and Sandra Best (right) who called an ambulance

‘I have been diabetic for 15 years and from Kieran being an early age he has seen me injecting myself on a daily basis, so I thought it was important to tell him what I am doing.

‘I also didn’t want him thinking it was something he should try.’

When Ms Carroll collapsed, Kieran took care of Layton, and led him safely across a busy road to knock on a neighbour’s door, before calling his aunt, Lindsay Smith.

An ambulance was called and paramedics rushed to the scene to give Ms Carroll a potentially life-saving glucose injection to bring her back to consciousness.

If Kieran had not found help, Ms Carroll could have slipped into a diabetic coma or even died.

Ms Carroll says that she has taught Kieran (right) what to do in an emergency so he knew that when he could not wake her he should go and find their neighbour, Sandra Best (left)

The proud mother praised quick-thinking Kieran for coming to the rescue.

Ms Carroll said: ‘Our front garden goes straight out onto the road so I worry about him crossing that on his own.

Ms Carroll (pictured) said: 'I'm really proud and I can't get over how grown-up he was. He's my hero'

‘But when he knocked on the neighbour’s door, he and Layton were standing there holding hands. He was really looking after him.

‘I’m really proud and I can’t get over how grown-up he was. He’s my hero.

‘If it wasn’t for him, I might not still be here today.’

The schoolboy is now set for a special treat, to thank him for his brave efforts.

Ms Carroll said: ‘We told him that we will give him a treat for all that he has done.

‘He will get a meal at his favourite restaurant and we are going to take him on a day trip wherever he wants to go.

‘We will be telling Layton what he needs to do in the future as well so they both know exactly what they have to do in an emergency.’

Ms Smith, 33, said: ‘He is an absolute superstar. We always told him to get help if something happened and it just shows that he listened.’

Ben Holdaway, director for Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: ‘A big well done to Kieran for his actions and for staying calm when he faced what must have been a very difficult situation.

‘He did the right thing to get help for his mum and she must be very proud of him.’

Type 1 diabetes develops when the insulin producing cells in the body have been destroyed and the body is unable to produce any insulin.

This means that it is unable to regulate the body's blood sugar levels.

When the blood sugar levels fall too low this is known as a 'hypo' - it occurs when the blood sugar level drops below four millimoles per litre.

Warning signs that blood sugar levels are falling include feeling hungry, trembling, sweating and difficulty concentrating.

The best way of preventing a hypo is to eat or drink something sugary.

If it is not treated, it can lead to unconsciousness, coma, and eventually death.

The safest way for a diabetic to avoid a hypo is to regularly check their blood sugar and to eat regularly.
