Crime behind bars: Damien Miller will spend another ten years in jail after he masterminded a heroin and cocaine racket from his cell

A drugs baron will spend another ten years behind bars for masterminding another heroin and cocaine racket from his prison cell.

Damien Miller, 31, was serving seven years for supplying drugs to his home city of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire yet he began a new criminal enterprise when he being transferred to an open prison.

Whilst on day release from North Sea Camp Prison in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices.

He then formed a new gang which peddled drugs in Stoke-on-Trent whilst he served out the rest of his stretch over 120 miles away. He even managed to pay £15,000 from drug dealing into his own bank account.

Police began investigating after noticing a rise in violent organised crime in Stoke and discovered Miller was the ringleader. They alerted bosses at the jail and began a surveillance operation and discovered that he was organising new drugs deals.

John Phillips, 29, was Miller’s ‘right-hand man’ in Stoke-on-Trent and controlled the day-to-day running of the drug crime while Miller remained in behind bars in Lincolnshire where he was said to be building a ‘comfortable life’ from the profits.

Police arrested in Miller in June last year after seizing more than 2.2lbs of heroin and cocaine worth around £100,000 and using mobile phone records to link low-level couriers to Miller and Phillips.

At Stafford Crown Court in Knutton, Miller admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine.

Phillips of Stoke, was jailed for seven and a half years and another seven men and two women were jailed for a total of 23 years.

Passing sentence Judge Michael Cullum told Miller today: ‘You had a role which was highly significant or borderline leading. ‘Clearly you conducted this enterprise while held at an open prison. This is a seriously aggravating feature.’

Former businessman Miller was initially jailed in 2009 after heading an operation to supply the dealers of Stoke with 2.2lbs of cocaine worth up to £88,000 which he bought from a Liverpool wholesale dealer.

He claimed he was ‘not an organiser’ and was acting ‘under orders’ and had once fled to Spain fearing he was about to be assassinated.

But police began investigating him again in 2011 after reports of wide scale drug dealing in the city.

Between March and June police carried out a series of raids and intercepted deliveries of varying amounts of cocaine, heroin and cash.

After each seizure of drugs, police observed increased contact between Miller, Phillips and other accomplices.

Over the course of the investigation, police seized more than 2.2lbs of cocaine and heroin from the conspirators.

Miller deposited £15,000 in his bank account over the three month period, while Phillips’ income totalled £2,680.

Detective Chief Inspector Paul Clews, head of Staffordshire Police’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: ‘Building a case against Miller, Phillips and their associates took a considerable team effort involving several agencies and police departments.

‘Miller did not handle the drugs himself, but got other people to do his dirty work for him. As head of the group he was controlling everyone, and everything, from a distance.

‘But by piecing together a series of events we were able to uncover Miller’s involvement and the extent of his crime, along with that of all the others involved.

‘We gathered evidence of events which led to cash and drugs being recovered. We have CCTV footage of Phillips meeting Miller at a pub in Nottingham. All aspects of Miller’s life in Lincolnshire were thoroughly investigated.

‘This case has also shown that some of those involved in this Organised Crime Group were vulnerable individuals who were easily manipulated by Miller and Phillips. People like this, who are so easily exploited by criminals, end up paying a high price.’

Governor of North Sea Camp Prison, Graham Batchford, said: ‘We are not complacent about prisoners who breach their licence conditions.

‘Today’s outcome is proof that we will take every measure possible, including working close with the police, to ensure that those who fall foul of the terms of their temporary release are swiftly brought to justice.’

Dane Parker, 23, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and conspiracy to money launder. He was jailed for three years, eight months.

Scott Mosedale, 26, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He was sentenced to two years, eight months.

Ryan Jones, 27, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted possessing criminal property and conspiracy to money launder. He received a sentence of one year, two months.

Stephanie Pitchford, 22, and Kerry Wilkinson, 25, both of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. They were sentenced to two years and one year, eight months respectively.

Anthony Bostock, 32, of Stoke-on-Trent, 
admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. He has been jailed for two years,
three months.

Byron Dunkley, 21, of Stafford, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He has gone to prison for 16 months.

Otis Fox, aged 22, a serving prisoner, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and the possession of criminal property. He denied conspiracy to supply cocaine. He was sentenced to three years, three months.                                                   

Liam Myatt, 22, Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. He was jailed for three years.
