When West End star Joanna Forest found a lump in her breast, she was just 21. A diagnosis of breast cancer made herÂ one of the youngest people ever to fall prey to the disease.

But after a gruelling regime of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy she was later given the all-clear.

Now 36, she is helping to raise awareness of the disease in young women and the importance of checking for lumps by taking part in a charity concert tonight.

Survivor: West End star Joanna Forest, now 36, was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 21

Terrifying: Joanna aged 21, just before being diagnosed with breast cancer

A special one-off concert, Busting to Sing, will see her take to the
 stage with Joe McElderry, Paul Potts and Jessie Wallace to name but a 
few.

Breast cancer is the 
most common form of the disease in the UK, with an estimated 48,000 
women diagnosed each year according to the NHS.

But approximately 80 per cent of breast cancer diagnoses in women are in the over-50s age group, which is why when Forest discovered a lump on her breast 15 years ago, she was so shocked.

'I was really surprised,' she says of the fateful moment she discovered the lump in her breast. 'It was something I didn't know could happen to someone at that age.

'I was away singing in a tour called The Best of Broadway and it was if it had just appeared overnight - I wasn't checking my breasts at all.'

Concerned, she rushed to see her GP as soon as she was home but was initially fobbed off and told it was a lump, but not of the sort to worry about.

But Joanna felt something was wrong and asked to have the lump removed. 'I had it out a couple of weeks later,' she explains.

'The day that I came back to have my stitches removed, they told me it was cancer. Then they gave me another operation to remove more tissue and some lymph nodes.'

So began her battle against the disease, starting with a six-week course of radiotherapy followed by a gruelling seven cycles of chemotherapy.

Instead of pursuing her acting career and enjoying twenty-something life with friends, Joanna was constantly exhausted and sick from the treatment and spent more time in hospital beds than in clubs.

'You want to be looking and feeling amazing,' she remembers. 'You want to feel on top of your game and full of beans. People were going out and it felt like I was missing out.'

Luckily for Joanna, the cancer had 
been caught early and after four years of hospital checks, she was 
finally given the all-clear and told that she didn't need to return.

'It was a bit scary,' she remembers. 'It's quite reassuring to be told you're OK every few months.'

But
 although Joanna was lucky, others haven't been so fortunate, among them
 Sophie Jones, 19, who died earlier this month from cervical cancer 
after doctors refused her a smear test.

Joanna, who is now an ambassador for breast cancer charity CoppaFeel!, says its crucial that young women remember to check themselves and understand that, although rare, they too can get cancer.

'To other women, I'd say it can happen to you, breast cancer does younger women so keep checking yourself, get to know about it and what the symptoms are.'

She hopes too, that the Busting to Sing concert will help make a difference and encourage more people to check their breasts.

'We've got such an awesome, fantastic 
line-up,' she enthuses. 'Who knew that Kat from Eastenders [Jessie Wallace] was such a good jazz singer?

'We've
 got Paul Potts, Joe McElderry, Shane Ward and Rhydian Roberts so its 
just going to be brilliant.'

Pausing for breath, she adds: 'I'm going to be singing as 
well and doing duet from Phantom of the Opera with Paul Potts. Even though I've done all kinds of things in my career, this is a dream come true.'

Busting to Sing, tonight from 7.30pm at The Palace Theatre. For more on CoppaFeel! see coppafeel.org
