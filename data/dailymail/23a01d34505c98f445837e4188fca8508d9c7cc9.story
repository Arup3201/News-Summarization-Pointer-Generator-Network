Who needs enemies when you have friends like these?

While it is never advisable to drink yourself into oblivion, if someone does find themselves in such a predicament, it's not unreasonable to hope their friends would be on hand to help them.

Not so for this unfortunate reveller.

The man was so drunk he was completely oblivious to what was be done to him by his friends

After drunkenly collapsing under Waterloo Bridge, London, the unknown man's friends - instead of carrying him to safety - set upon him with permanent markers, colouring in his face, chest and back.

The incident occurred shortly shortly after 5pm on March 23. Photographs of the scene snap three police officers turning up to take charge of the situation and they eventually manage to revive the man.

However, he seems far from pleased at how his day has turned out, shouting at the police as they get back into their van and, slightly disorientated, even falling into it.

The police arrived but, after reviving the man, left him at the scene with his companions

The three men took their time to make sure their friend's face, back and chest were completely covered

After the officers have left, the 
video shows him picking a fight with his companions, presumably over 
their penmanship, before disappearing around the corner with them.

A
 spokeswoman for the London Metropolitan Police said they have no record
 of being called out to this incident and that it is likely the officers
 were simply passing and decided to lend a helping hand.

The
 London Ambulance Service recorded a call that matches the time and 
location of the incident but, because the ambalance was cancelled and 
recalled before it arrived on scene, their logs cannot confirm whether 
they were driving to attend to this man or not.

Police officers turned up to take control of the situation and save the man from further defacement

After carrying the man away from the main thoroughfare, the police were able to wake him from his stupor

Aggressive: The man was not happy with the police waking him up, shouting at them as they got into their van and even collapsing into the side of it

Squabble: He seemed annoyed at his companions for their penmanship, even picking a fight with one of the other men before they all disappeared around a corner
