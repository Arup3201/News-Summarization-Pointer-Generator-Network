A 50-year-old American woman and young son visiting
relatives in the Philippines were abducted by armed men today.

Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, her 14-year-old son Kevin and 19-year-old Filipino nephew Romnick Jackaria were snatched by more than a dozen gunmen from a resort on the island of Tictabon.

The island lies in the troubled south, near
a stronghold of Al Qaeda-linked militants, officials said.

The mother and son are both naturalised U.S. citizens.

Suspicion fell on the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf,
which has been blamed for ransom kidnappings, beheadings and bombings in the
last two decades

Another possibility is a Muslim rebel commander whose group has been linked to
previous abductions.

The 400-plus Abu Sayyaf militants, who are fighting for an
Islamist state in the predominantly Christian nation, are holding three other
kidnap victims, including a child, as part of desperate efforts to raise funds,
according to the Philippine army.

The assailants seized the trio before dawn from a house in the island village, part of Zamboanga city, and then fled with their captives in two motorised boats, said
police Senior Superintendent Edwin de Ocampo.

There has been no contact or ransom demand from the
abductors, and their identities remain unconfirmed, de Ocampo said.

The abduction took place near Basilan Island, the birthplace
and stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf militants, about 550 miles south of Manila.

The largest Muslim separatist group, Moro Islamic Liberation
Front, also has a presence in the area but they have been negotiating with the
government amid a ceasefire that has been largely holding in the restive
southern Philippines for several years.

However, the military said a separatist Moro commander
identified as Waning Abdulsalam may have been responsible.

Rebel spokesman Von
Al Haq said his group would investigate but that it has no such report and will
not tolerate criminal activities.

Police earlier said the woman was a Filipino married to a
German national and that the family lives in the U.S. state of Virginia.

Philippine soldiers search for Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebels. The military said a separatist Moro commander, Waning Abdulsalam, may be responsible for the abductions

But army Colonel Buenaventura Pascual, commander of an
anti-terrorist task force in Zamboanga, said his men on Tictabon Island saw the
U.S. passports of Lunsmann and her son, showing they were American citizens.

Lunsman was originally from Basilan and her previous name
was Jerpa Usman, police and military officials said.

Col. Pascual said the woman's husband is apparently an American
citizen of German ancestry.

He did not accompany his wife and son, who arrived
in the Philippines two weeks ago to visit relatives.

Calls and text messages to the U.S. Embassy went unanswered
today.

'We have deployed troops to track down the
victims,' Col. Pascual said.

Presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said the local crisis
committee was convened and that police and the military were trying to rescue
the victims and capture the culprits.

Military spokesman Lt. Col. Randolph Cabangbang said
intelligence reports showed the victims may have been brought to Basilan's
Tuburuan township.
