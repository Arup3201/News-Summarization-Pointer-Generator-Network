Della Callagher, 46, died two days after eating a reheated festive lunch on Christmas Day 2012

A chef who worked at a pub where a customer died from Christmas Day dinner poisoning admits he did not test whether the turkey was cooked properly.

Mother-of-one Della Callagher, 46, died two days after eating a reheated four-course festive lunch at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex on Christmas Day 2012.

None of the meals, which left 32 other people seriously ill, were probed with a thermometer at the point of serving to ensure they were safe to eat.

The pub’s former landlady, Anne-Marie McSweeney, 40, and head chef Mehmet Kaya, 37, along with the brewer Mitchells & Butler, are accused of serving unsafe food.

McSweeney’s lawyers insist she could have had no idea what temperature the turkey was and blame kitchen staff for the lethal mistake.

Andre Paxi, a junior chef, admitted that the turkey meat, which had been cooked the day before, was not tested before it was served.

Mr Paxi, who had worked at the Railway Hotel for four years, said about half the turkey meat had been heated in a food warmer, while the rest was blasted in the microwave if it seemed too cool.

Yannick Fielding, defending McSweeney said: ‘In an ideal world, all of the turkey should have been put in the microwave before being served to customers, is that right?

‘Yes’ Mr Paxi replied.

Mr Paxi added: ‘If they are not sure the food is hot enough [kitchen staff] have to use a probe, but if they are sure they don’t have to use a probe.’

Asked how he would make the decision if the food was hot enough without the probe, Mr Paxi replied: ‘We would look at the steam.’

He agreed that anyone who had not actually been in the kitchen would have had no idea whether the lethal turkey would have been in the microwave.

More than 30 diners fell ill with food poisoning after the meal at the Railway Hotel in Hornchurch, Essex

The meat-based gravy had not had its temperature probed and recorded either.

Mr Paxi was sacked by senior managers at Mitchells & Butler but he said he had been made a scapegoat.

Kaya and McSweeney are accused of contaminating the meat on Christmas Eve by failing to follow proper cooking and cooling procedure.

Kaya, who had spent eight years with the chain, told investigators that he had cooked the turkey meat on the 24 December, and begun the cooling process between 3 and 4pm.

He gave a detailed account of how he had checked the temperature of each breast, and recorded the results in the kitchen’s records.

Kaya then said he had placed the containers over a chiller for one hour before checking and recording the temperature again, before placing them in a walk-in fridge at about 8pm.

But CCTV footage showed him leaving the pub at 4pm and he did not return for the rest of the day.

McSweeney, who had worked for the company for 24 years, then claimed she had checked the temperature of the cooling meat herself, and had remembered the figures so that he could write them in the log on his next shift.

The pub’s CCTV footage showed she had not left the front of house for more than two minutes for the remainder of the shift, allegedly not giving her enough time to check the turkey in the kitchen. 

In an earlier hearing, Mrs Callagher’s husband John told the court his wife’s death was ‘horrific’ and described the moment she began shaking and rolled her eyes back while lying in bed next to him.

He told the court that his wife began to feel unwell at around 5:30am on Boxing Day and he started to feel unwell about an hour later.

Mr Callagher said: 'We both had the same symptoms, but Della got progressively far worse than me as we went throughout the day, with vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pain.

'I was getting increasingly concerned as the day went on. The vomiting and diarrhoea wouldn't stop and Della was a very private person, and it was horrific to see what was going on.

'My mother-in-law called NHS Helpline first and that didn't seem to work, whatever that was, and then the paramedics were called by 999.’

He added that because of the food poisoning, which was later attributed to a bacteria known as Clostridium perfringens, he was too unwell to go to hospital with her.

She later returned home after doctors believed she had norovirus and paramedics gave her an injection in the ambulance.

Mother-of-one, Mrs Callagher, who tragically later died, was initially seen at Queen's Hospital in Romford

Mr Callagher said: 'She got far, far, far, worse. It was horrific.'

He added: 'Something changed. I felt her physically shake and her eyes rolled, as if she was having a cardiac arrest.'

He claimed that the ambulance took more than 45 minutes to arrive, as somebody instructed his brother how to do CPR.

He said: 'We had someone on the line who was instructing us to do CPR. My brother-in-law was giving her CPR and trying to save her, but there was no sign of life.’

Mrs Callagher was pronounced dead at the hospital on December 27, 2012 at around 8:15am.

The pub company, based on Fleet Street, Birmingham, denies two counts of placing unsafe food on the market by failing to enforce food hygiene standards in its outlets.

McSweeney, of Suttons Avenue, Hornchurch, and Kaya of Purfleet, Essex, both deny a charge of placing unsafe food on the market, and a further charge of doing an act to pervert the course of justice by allegedly falsifying their food safety records.

McSweeney further denies obstructing an officer in the course of their duty for allegedly handing the falsified documents to food safety inspectors.

The trial continues.

The bacterium Clostridium perfringens is widely distributed in the environment and food. It is the third most common cause of food poisoning in the UK.

If spores of the bacteria survive cooking, they can germinate to form growing cells. Spores cannot grow in a refrigerator or freezer but thrive at room temperature.

In optimal growing conditions, the organism has a generation time of 10 to 12 minutes. When a large number of the vegetative cells are consumed this will more-likely-than-not lead to gastroenteritis.

Food poisoning from the bacteria most often occurs when foodstuffs, usually red meat or poultry, is prepared in advance and kept warm for several hours before serving.

The illness, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain the main symptoms, generally lasts for less than 24 hours but elderly people may be more seriously affected.

The bacteria is also responsible for 80-95 per cent of gas gangrene cases, a rare but severe form of gangrene.
