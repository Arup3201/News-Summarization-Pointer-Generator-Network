All is in readiness for arguably the biggest day in Australian horse-racing, with almost $6 million up for grabs across Sydney and Melbourne on Saturday.

Super Saturday rivals the Melbourne Cup for the sport's grand occasions .. and this may just be the pipe-opener for even bigger days ahead this Autumn, including Nicole Richie's role as international ambassador for the Golden Slipper.

But before her arrival, the world's three fastest horses, all Australian, will race for the $1 million prize at Flemington on what is dubbed 'Super Saturday'. The young bucks and fabulous fillies, however, will be on show on course and around it too, with Ladies Day at Rosehill.

The world’s highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee from the Mick Price stable and Terravista, trained by Joe Pride, are at the top of betting for the $1 million Group 1 Lexus Newmarket Handicap.

Lankan Rupee has returned in stellar form, fresh from a triumphant first-up run in the Black Caviar Lightning on February 21. He will have to lump top weight of 58.5kg as he aims to become only the fifth horse to record consecutive Newmarket wins, after saluting last March.

A winner of 11 of 21 career starts, Lankan Rupee will have to equal Hay List’s metric weight-carrying record if he is to muster a sixth career Group 1.

To do that he will have to overcome Terravista, who is ridden by the in-form Hugh Bowman. Joe Pride's star sprinter was a very impressive winner of the Group 1 Darley Classic over the Newmarket course and distance during the Melbourne Cup Carnival.

To his great advantage, he has two kilos less than Lankan Rupee, in trying to beat history by becoming the first horse since 1917 to taste first-up success in the Newmarket.

And if they don't salute, waiting in the wings to claim the title of world's best is another star, Chautauqua, who will carry 55.5kg.

The impressive grey has not yet won a Group 1 in 11 starts, but has saluted twice in Group 2 events.

Trained by the Hawkes triumvirate, the four-year-old was beaten less than a neck by Terravista and finished ahead of Lankan Rupee in the Darley Classic.

'This year’s Newmarket is shaping as one of the most exciting renewals in history with the world’s three highest-rated sprinters, Lankan Rupee, Terravista and Chautauqua, all expected to take their place on Super Saturday,' Racing Victoria handicapper Neil Jennings said.

Jockey Craig Williams appears happy with his mount in the $1 million Australian Cup. But Protectionist, the reigning Melbourne Cup champ will need to overcome favourite Happy Trails, among others, to make history at Flemington on Super Saturday

Craig Williams will take the ride on the Kris Lee-trained Protectionist, who is aiming to equal the likes of Makybe Diva and Fiorente as horses to have claimed the elusive Melbourne Cup and Australian Cup double

And there's no knock on the Chris Waller trained Brazen Beau either, carrying the lighweight 52kg and with star jockey Joao Moreira in the saddle, he will be primed for the 1200m event, off the back of a second to Lankan Rupee. 

The Kris Lees-trained Protectionist has drawn barrier three as he looks to emulate the deeds of 2013 Melbourne Cup winner Fiorente, by claiming the $1 million Australian Cup in his following preparation.

16 horses accepted for the $1 million 2000 metre Group 1, which will be one of the highlights of Flemington’s ‘Super Saturday’.

Craig Williams will take the ride on the former German runner and Lees will be hoping for a better run than the sixth the Melbourne Cup winner managed when resuming as a $2.90 favourite in the Group 2 Peter Young Stakes at Caulfield.

The ageless Red Cadeaux, who is a three-time runner up in the Melbourne Cup, will be ridden by Bowman but has fared poorly, drawing barrier 14 in a 16-horse field.

The nine-year-old, who has a remarkable record in the race that stops a nation, is yet to win in Australia in four attempts.

Over in Sydney's west, they will kick off The Golden Slipper Carnival with Ladies Day.

They've been spruiking the event as 'The New Breed' and will culminate with the arrival of their ATC's international ambassador, Nicole Richie, next week.

'It starts three weeks of spectacular racing and entertainment at Rosehill Gardens – including Australia’s biggest day of Group 1 racing, Golden Slipper Day,' said the ATC statement.

John Thompson's glamour three year old filly First Seal headlines a stellar cast of girls in the Group 1 Coolmore Classic, which is worth $600,000.

But she will have to overcome the likes of Group 1 winners in Dear Demi and Diamond Drille.

Hartnell was expected to take on Protectionist in the Australian Cup but has been reserved for an easier mission in the Group 3 Sky High Stakes in Sydney.

And the ATC will stage its final two major lead up races to the $3.5 million Golden Slipper, which will be run next Saturday, as the countdown continues to the world’s richest race for two year olds.

 ATC Ambassador and Home and Away star Erika Heynatz will play a leading role on the day and feature at the Ladies Long Lunch.

The New Breed Bar, focusing on the new racegoer, will be opened for the first time.

Australian Turf Club Chief Operating Officer Tony Partridge said the first day of the Golden Slipper Carnival promises wall-to-wall action and entertainment.

'Ladies Day is all about the girls, and with our great Ambassador Erika Heynatz and all of the treats for the ladies on course, along with one of the best fillies in Australia in First Seal on the track, what a start for racing fans,'’ Mr Partridge said.

This is just the start, after Golden Slipper Day, focus will turn to the multi-million dollar double weekend of racing at Royal Randwick, known as 'The Championships'.

One of the features will be what they have dubbed 'Little Sydney', including 'extraordinary food and wine, offering racegoers a gourmet experience designed by celebrity chefs from China Doll, Chiswick and Icebergs'.

The 'world-class playground' inside Royal Randwick does not come cheap though - tickets are $450 each and despite the cost, they're going quicker than Lankan Rupee and Terravista.
