Tremors have reportedly hit a Florida city at least three times.

Coral Gables residents have told local media they've felt the shaking inside their homes.

Authorities so far have yet to figure out what's behind the tremors.

Matt Meehan, who lives in the city, told CBS Miami - which first reported on the shaking -  'These windows started ratting like this. And I'm looking around, and I have a little cat [that] went running in the other direction.' 

'My first thought was earthquake,' he told the television station. 

Another resident, Boo Zamek, told the CBS affiliate it was a 'very low, um, very subtle vibration' and called it 'strange, curious.'

A spokeswoman for the Coral Gables police department, Kelly Denham, told Daily Mail Online that police received two reports in the past four weeks regarding the 'loud explosion-type noises,' as well as a third report shortly before 11am Tuesday.

Officers have checked out the sounds each time, Denham said, but they have so far been unable to locate their source.

'We have no idea what those noises are,' Denham said.

Incidents: The tremors reportedly took place in this stretch of Coral Gables, Florida

A spokesman for the US Geological Survey said the agency had no recent earthquakes reported in Florida.

Meanwhile, Bill Orlove, a representative for Florida Power & Light (FPL), told Daily Mail Online 'I can tell you that our electrical equipment was working properly in the Coral Gables neighborhood during the time when customers were experiencing loud noises. We have no reports of outages and no equipment issues during that time.' 

CBS Miami pointed out that a sonic boom reportedly took place Saturday - and reported that the times for the boom and the Coral Gables tremors failed to match.

In that case, the American Meterological Society (AMS) said more than 230 reports came in of a fireball. Many of the reports came from central and northern Florida.

Earlier this month, tremors and noises were also reported in St. Johns County, according to First Coast News.

A St. Johns County Sheriff's Office (SJCSO) spokesman spoke to the television station at the time, and attributed the noises to being sonic booms from military flight training.
