Former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno is eligible for half a million dollars in pension after spending 46 years in charge at the university.

Paterno, 84, was fired as head coach last week after his former second-in-command Jerry Sandusky 
was charged with sexually abusing boys over a period of 15 years.

It has also been confirmed that Sandusky collects $59,000 annual pension and withdrew $148,000 upon retirement from his job at Penn State, according to records obtained by the Associated Press.

Sweet package: Penn State's former football coach Joe Paterno, with his wife Sue on the front porch of their house, could be in line for $500,000 pension

The formula used by the State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) makes Paterno eligible for a pension equal to 100 per cent of the average of his three highest-salary years.

His pay rose from $541,000 to $568,000 over the past three years.

There also is a long-service supplement that could boost Paterno to 110 per cent of his final average salary.

A spokesman for SERS said 
benefit limits may apply, so the agency was unable to give an estimate of Paterno's full package before it was awarded.

When Paterno retires, he will have to 
make decisions about his pension, including whether to 
bequeath benefits to a loved one after he dies and whether to obtain
a one-time, lump-sum payment of his own contributions.

It was also revealed that Paterno transferred full ownership of his house to his wife Sue for $1 in July, according to the New York Times. The couple had previously both been on the deeds for the house.

Paterno's attorney Wick Sollers told the Times in an email that the transfer had nothing to do with the scandal but was part of an ongoing 'planning program'.

Paterno has not been charged with
any crime. However the 83-year-old, who was in his 46th year as head 
coach of the Nittany Lions and winner of two national championships, has
been criticised for not doing more to intervene when incidents of 
Sandusky's abuse came to light.

A graduate assistant went to Paterno after he allegedly saw Sandusky raping a boy in the football team's locker room shower.

A grand jury report said Paterno contacted the athletic director but did not go to police, and he has said he wishes he had done more.

It was announced today that a new judge has been appointed to the hearing of  accused child molester Sandusky.

Conflict of interests: Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who once volunteered at Sandusky's charity Second Mile, has been removed from his case

Robert Scott, from Westmoreland County, has been brought in after a court request for an out-of-county senior judge.

Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who sits in Center County where Penn State is located, had requested Sandusky be freed on $100,000 unsecured bail on November 5.

It has been claimed the judge had a conflict of interest because she was a volunteer for The Second Mile, the charity Sandusky founded.

Her decision overruled a bid by prosecutors who requested a $500,000 bail be set for 67-year-old Sandusky.

She also denied a request for the alleged molester to be fitted with a leg monitor, after he was charged with 21 felony counts for alleged sexual abuse.

A spokesman for Pennsylvania Courts said Mr Scott 'has no known connections with the Pennsylvania State University, the Second Mile Charity, nor any officers or representatives of any of those entities'.

The preliminary hearing for Sandusky will be held on December 7 or at another date set by Judge Scott.

Sandusky has been charged with sexually abusing eight boys over a period of 15 years.

In an interview earlier this week, Sandusky denied he was a paedophile but admitted that he 'shouldn't have showered with those kids'.
