Rachel Gow, 29, from Haslingden, Lancashire, struggled to overcome the death of her mother, and desperately wanted a family of her own, an inquest heard

A high-flying health service administrator killed herself when depressed, anxious and concerned that she was about to turn 30 without marrying or starting a family, an inquest heard.

Graduate Rachel Gow, who was also struggling to recover from the death of her mother, wanted to walk up the aisle and have children.

She became troubled that her siblings were ‘doing better than her’, the hearing was told.

Two months before her 30th birthday, she texted her engineer boyfriend, Anton Tsarev, 30, wishing him ‘all the best for the future’.

He found her body on the floor when he returned to the house they shared. Her family and boyfriend told the hearing of their devastation that the ‘kind and generous’ self-confessed ‘dizzy blonde’ hadn’t lived to see her dreams fulfilled.

After doing well at school, where she enjoyed dancing and playing the violin, Miss Gow studied at Lancaster University where she graduated with a 2:1 in history, the hearing was told. She most recently secured a job as an administrator at Royal Bolton Hospital.

In a statement read to the hearing, her brother Stephen Best and sister Sarah Davidson said: ‘Her greatest wish was to settle down and get married.’

She had been through three break-ups before meeting Mr Tsarev in May 2012, they said, and had been very badly affected by the death of her mother Connie, a primary school teacher, from cancer at the age of 66.

The couple moved into a house in Haslingden, Lancashire in 2013, and according to family and friends seemed content. ‘Following the death of her mother, Rachel had a period of independence,’ her siblings’ statement continued.

‘She met Anton and they were both extremely happy. He moved in. They had lots in common. But she could not overcome her previous sadness and felt Anton would leave her. She was looking forward to turning 30, planning trips to Italy with Anton and going to Vegas for her birthday, she was saving money every month.

‘But the relationship became unstable and they tried to make it work.’ 

Mr Tsarev told the hearing in Burnley: ‘Our relationship had a lot of ups and downs due to her insecurities. She constantly felt I was going to leave her but this was not the case.’

Miss Gow went to see a psychologist last September as she struggled to cope with the approaching milestone as well as the anniversary of her mother’s death.

‘She felt she was not where she should be in life,’ Mr Tsarev said.

The inquest was told that she was worried her boyfriend Anton Tsarev, 30, would leave her, and suffered a number of insecurities about the relationship

Miss Gow, who was due to celebrate her 30th birthday in January this year, went to see a psychologist in September 2014

He added that his girlfriend felt that she should be married with children by now and that her siblings were doing better than her. ‘This was something she struggled with,’ he said.

She had also talked about suicide techniques but he had regarded the comments as being ‘in the heat of the moment,’ he added. 

The day before Rachel was found last November 1, the couple went to her father's house to look after his dog while he was away. But in the morning, the couple had an argument over a text message Miss Gow had found on Mr Tsarev's phone from someone else.

He said: 'In the morning we both got up. I had my phone on charge in the bed room. She looked at it. She came into the living room very upset telling me to leave. She had found texts on my phone from someone. They were not out of the ordinary. She didn't see it that way.'

Mr Tsarev told the inquest that his girlfriend felt that she should be married with children and that her siblings were doing better than her

Later that the day couple drove home to their house in Haslingden and Anton went out to visit a friend in Preston. He said: 'She was still upset when we arrived home. She was very agitated. This was not a new thing.' 

He told the court he had left the house after picking some clothes  and went to stay somewhere else for a while.

Miss Gow was an 'outgoing, adventurous and loving' young woman

He added: 'I got a text from her wishing me the best for the future. It was common place after an argument so I didn't think anything of it.'

However Mr Tsarev 'had a really bad feeling' so he decided to go back to Haslingden to see if everything was alright. He said: ' I went into the lounge. The lights were off but the fire was on. I could see her body lying on the floor.'

The inquest was told that Anton performed CPR on Miss Gow until emergency services arrived just before 9pm, but Miss Gow was pronounced dead.

Tests showed Miss Gow had died from hypoxia. 

Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Richard Taylor said: 'We have a girl who is severely troubled by a number of aspects of her life. 

'As I understand it she was having a slightly more positive year because of new employment. But she clearly had difficulties and at some stage she purchased the items with which she took her own life.

'It appears from her actions she did that with intent to end her life.'

In a statement Mr Tsarev said: 'Everyone is devastated by Rachel's death. It's a tragic loss for everyone, I'm absolutely heartbroken. 

'Being around her was so easy, we enjoyed all the same things and we loved going walking together in the Lake District. Rachel did a lot of travelling all over the world and she was very adventurous and loved life.

'She was a fantastic person who inspired everyone around her. She was still grieving for her mum - they were very close. She really did miss her mum, she always spoke very highly of her.'

Miss Gow's brother Stephen Best added: 'Through all of our grief and sadness, it is essential that we remind ourselves of why we all loved her. Rachel was effervescent, full of fun and laughter, and could tell a brilliant joke.

Sister Sarah Davidson said: 'She was very popular and made friends easily. She was a kind and generous person who made other people feel at ease. She was a treasured sister and was wonderful with children.'
