Pilots claimed yesterday that new European rules could force them to stay awake for 22 hours before landing a plane.

The watering down of restrictions on flying hours and rest periods will make them over-tired and put lives at risk, they said.

The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) has released a dossier of near-disasters, including three pilots falling asleep at the same time on a transatlantic flight to Heathrow.

'Unsafe and discredited': British pilots union BALPA has lost its battle to persuade MEPs to vote against new European regulations for flying hours

In another incident, a pilot said he 
and a colleague messed up a landing at the airport ‘with possible fatal 
consequences’ because they were ‘punch-drunk with tiredness’.

A
 survey of 500 commercial pilots found 56 per cent had fallen asleep at 
the controls and nearly one in three woke up to find their co-pilot had 
also nodded off. Half said tiredness was the major threat to passenger 
safety.

But Balpa lost its 
battle yesterday to persuade European MPs to vote against the 
regulations, which will be brought in from 2015 unless they are rejected
 by the European council of ministers later this year.

The
 new regime was voted through by 387 votes to 218, despite the European 
parliament’s transport committee voting 21-13 against last week.

Mixed messages: The decision comes despite the European Parliament's own transport committee voting by 21-13 to reject the EU plans amid safety fears

The
 rules mean pilots can be asked to do seven early starts in a row – from
 as early as 3am – rather than just three; and work up to 110 hours per 
fortnight rather than 95, the union says.

Restrictions
 on how much time they can spend on standby, when a flight is delayed 
due to adverse weather conditions or technical problems, will also be 
lifted.

This means that
 in extreme cases they could be awake for 22 hours before touching down.
 On some long-haul flights the number of pilots required to be on duty 
will be cut from three to two.  

Balpa
 general secretary Jim Mc-Auslen said: ‘It is a scandal that the 
unelected and unaccountable European Commission can force through cuts 
to UK flight safety that have been rejected by MEPs on their own 
transport committee, UK MPs, pilots across Britain and Europe, 
scientists and the British flying public.’

Evidence: The testimony also follows publication by the CAA of an incident report from a Virgin Atlantic pilot flying an Airbus saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days

And
 Louise Ellman, Labour MP and  chairman of the Commons transport select 
committee, said: ‘I agree with Balpa’s concerns that the proposed 
changes to EU rules could endanger passenger safety. There is still time
 for the UK and Europe to think again.’

The
 Government and the Civil Aviation Authority backed the shake-up. ‘Pilot
 fatigue is a real risk in the aviation industry and we take the 
management of fatigue very seriously,’ CAA chief executive Andrew Haines
 said.

‘Fatigue has 
multiple causes, and must be managed in a practical, hands-on way, not 
simply by asking airlines and pilots to comply with a set of 
timetables.’

Phil Bennion 
MEP, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said: ‘This is a sensible 
outcome. Despite concerns from pilots’ unions, these rules will not 
lower safety standards.’
