The 24-year-old put in the performance of his life  in front of 10,000 screaming fans in Manchester to beat Jahmene Douglas to the coveted title.

The Middlesborough-born singer earned a standing ovation from the judges and brought the house down with his incredible rendition of Shontelle hit Impossible, which is now odds-on to be the Christmas No.1 single and has already topped the iTunes charts.

Winner: James Arthur didn't know what to say as Dermot O'Leary revealed that he had won the X Factor 2012

After gaining 54 per cent of the public 
vote and being crowned the winner, James struggled to speak as he was 
interviewed by Dermot O'Leary.

He could only manage: 'Thank you, thank you so much. Have I really won? Wow. I don't know what to say.'

Runner-up Jahmene, who was also mentored by winning judge Nicole Scherzinger, was gallant in his defeat, and praised the show's victor, telling Dermot: 'It's such a blessing to even share a stage with such a talent, he's my idol.'

But appearing on Daybreak on Monday morning, James admitted he didn't hear the final name being announced.

He said: 'It is starting to sink in, I was overwhelmed. That is why my reaction was so still. I couldn't believe it. I actually thought Dermot said Jahmene.'

James added that he is keen to release his debut album 'as quickly as possible', and has already written some tracks.

He said: 'I'm just going to work hard and get my album out as quickly as possible and not wait around. I've got a lot of material to go so now as soon as I get back into the studio I'll be ready.'

So proud: Nicole was seen beaming with pride as she held hands with Jahmene who said that James was his 'idol'

As the vote was announced on Sunday 
night's show, James looked stunned, before pulling in his competitor 
Jahmene for an emotional embrace.

Before performing his winner's single
 one more time, James told Dermot he is thrilled that the proceeds of 
the record are going to charity Together for Short Lives.

Upcoming release: James' first single Impossible

He said: 'I'm so 
pleased it's going to a good cause, thank you so much to everyone who 
voted for me - I'm so thankful.'

When the single was released at midnight, it shot straight to the top of the iTunes charts - overtaking will.i.am and Britney Spears's Scream & Shout.

In addition, the original track by Shontelle has reentered the charts at number 13.

The X Factor victory then belted out 
the track, before being joined on stage by the majority of the rest of 
the show finalists, who hugged and jumped on James as they congratulated
 him.

Another person to congratulate James on his victory was Simon Cowell, who wrote on Twitter: 'Congratulations James on winning X factor uk. You deserved this.'

Before the winner was announced, James and Jahmene had treated viewers and the judges to two incredible performances.

Former Asda worker Jahmene took to the stage first with his heartfelt rendition of Robbie Williams' Angels - a performance which left the panel gushing.

Gary Barlow also acknowledged Jahmene's tough start in life, saying: 'You have been battling with your past and fighting for your future you have done it with such dignity and grace.

'Congratulations another stunning night for you.'

But Jahmene's mentor Nicole struggled
 to control her emotions following the performance, breaking down as she
 listened to him sing.

Following the song, Nicole told Jahmene: 'You just bring spirit and hope to this song when you sing I 
just feel safe. Your my role model you are like a beacon of light. I 
love you sweetie..'

James was next to take to the stage, performing his unique version of Marvin Gaye's Let's Get it On.

After the rendition, Louis told him: 'You're original, you are real, you are honest.'
