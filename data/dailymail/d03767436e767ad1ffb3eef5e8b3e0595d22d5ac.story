Stongehenge has stood frozen in time for thousands of years, but this replica was never going to survive to welcome the summer solstice.

Using chainsaws and ice cutters, five friends created their very own freezing homage to the ancient structure on a frosted Wisconsin lake.

Each of the gigantic ice pillars used to make the frozen circle weighed a back-breaking 300 pounds.

The blocks placed on top of the model of the neolithic monument weighed a further 200 pounds.

Frozen in time: Five friends created this homage to Stonehenge using huge blocks of ice cut from Rock Lake, Wisconsin

This was the second time Drew McHenry, Kevin Lehner, Quinn Williams, Alec Seamars and Patrick Shields had attempted to recreate Stonehenge.

Last year they had to abandoned their Icehenge plans due to persistent below zero temperatures and the thickness of Rock Lake.

The team took two weeks to create the giant frozen structure using chainsaws and ice cutters

This year the huge structure took shape in just two weeks after the group were blessed with perfect weather conditions.

The reproduction of the monument  was enjoyed by hundreds of people before it had to be taken down due to safety concerns as the ice began to melt.

'It is a great example of how a small group of folks can collaborate to make something magic,' said Mr Lehner.

The group first started experimenting with ice cutting four years ago. 

No-one is sure why the original Stonehenge, which can be found in Wiltshire, UK, was built or how.

Over the years people have suggested that it was a temple, parliament and a graveyard.
