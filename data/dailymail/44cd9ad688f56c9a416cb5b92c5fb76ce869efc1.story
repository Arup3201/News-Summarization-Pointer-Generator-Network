'Evil': Donna Wright, 33, was spared a jail sentence for sending vile internet abuse to family of a missing girl

A family targeted by an internet hoaxer posing as their missing daughter told of their outrage yesterday after she was spared jail.

Donna Wright, 33, was branded 'pure evil' after sending a string of online messages to the parents of Katrice Lee, who went missing on her second birthday   in 1981.

A court heard she gave the family false hope by claiming to be their daughter. But when a DNA test proved she was lying, she began bombarding them with insults.

In one of the most hurtful messages, she blamed the Lees for losing their daughter, adding: 'You make me sick.'

She also told Katrice's mother, Sharon, 59: 'You silly old bitch, you thought you had seen harassment. You have not seen harassment yet.'

Katrice's father Richard, 63, branded her 'sick' and asked why she had not been sent to jail.

Mr Lee, of Hartlepool, said: 'I do not believe Donna Wright got her just deserts. I had hoped for a prison sentence.

'It will not be long before she is at it again. She has put my family through purgatory.

'I would ask her to put herself in my shoes just for one day.'

Katrice went missing as her mother was buying crisps at a shop near the Army base in Paderborn, Germany, where her father was stationed with the King's Royal Hussars.

Believing she was snatched, the couple – who divorced 20 years ago – later set up a Facebook page dedicated to finding her.

Their hopes were raised when Wright made contact on Facebook in December 2011 to say she might be Katrice, Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court in County Durham was told.

Harassed: Katrice Lee, left, has been missing since she disappeared from a shopping centre in West Germany in 1981. Her father Richard Lee, right, described her as a 'very sad and sick individual'

Upset: The sister of missing Katrice Lee, Natasha, said she is 'filled with dread' every time she logs on to Facebook

Compensation: Donna Wright was ordered to pay £400 in compensation to the family of Katrice Lee and told her contact with them 'must stop'

But even after the negative DNA test,
Wright continued to send messages, despite being warned by police. She 
was eventually arrested last December.

Wright claimed her mother had said 
that an uncle had 'brought her a little girl because her family did not 
want her'.

Another message said: 'I was brought over from Germany. Will 
you please help me look into this. It's a cover-up.'

Most offensively, she told Mrs Lee, of Gosport, Hampshire: 'You lost your daughter over a packet of crisps, you make me sick.'

Katrice's sister Natasha, 39, who 
helps her parents run the Facebook page, said Wright was 'pure evil'.

She added: 'Every day is like a waking nightmare for me.

'Devastated and heartbroken, I grew up not knowing where my sister is. This is even harder to bear because of Donna Wright.'

Wright, from Spennymoor, County 
Durham, admitted harassment without violence.

She received a restraining
order and a suspended 12-week jail sentence, and was told to pay £200 
compensation each to Katrice's mother and sister.

District Judge Martin Walker said Wright 'must have known of the pain and grief suffered by the sister and mother of Katrice'.
