A man has admitted killing his baby daughter after she suffered horrific brain injuries when he shook her violently because he couldn't stop her from crying.

Kurt Delves, 22, had been due to go on trial today for the manslaughter of two-month-old Harli Reid but pleaded guilty to unlawfully killing her before the hearing started.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that Delves, 20 at the time of Harli's death in December 2010, had been Christmas shopping hours before her death with the baby's mother Donnika Reid.

Admission: Kurt Delves admitted killing baby daughter Harli Reid before he was due to go on trial at Birmingham Crown Court

Ms Reid went out on a night out with friends and Delves agreed to look after the baby.

He was bathing Harli before bed when the incident happened.

Delves had initially claimed that he was bathing Harli and after splashing water in her face she became 'floppy' causing Delves to shake her lightly in an attempt to rouse her.

Harli was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital but died the following day.

Detectives were able to prove through expert analysis that the baby had in fact been shaken with sufficient force to cause devastating brain injuries.

'In what appears to have been a momentary 
loss of control, he snapped and shook his daughter in frustration at 
being unable to stop her crying.'

Medical experts also found no underlying conditions that could have caused Harli's brain injuries.

Detective Constable Lyndsey Yates, who worked on the inquiry, said: 'Delves was said to be very hands-on with his baby and would often take the lead when bathing, feeding and changing nappies.

'But, in what appears to have been a momentary loss of control, he snapped and shook his daughter in frustration at being unable to stop her crying.

'He caused fatal injuries - injuries he then tried to cover up by inventing a story about how sheâ€™d fallen ill whilst in the bath.

'We were able to expose those lies and Delves was eventually left with little option but to admit his actions.'

Delves will be sentenced next month.
