When Staff Sergeant Thomas Baysore, 31, deployed to Afghanistan, he told his son Darren, that he could leave messages to him by talking to the moon. Then, 12 months ago, Staff Sgt Baysore was killed in action, the six-year-old boy said he wanted to leave his porch light on so his father could always see his house. 

Then on the first anniversary of his father's death, the youngster, through social media, got thousands of his neighbours in Clarksville, Tennessee to leave their lights on in remembrance of Sgt Baysore. 

Sgt Baysore was shot in the neck by a terrorist wearing an Afghan National Army Uniform in Paktya Province, Afghanistan on September 26, 2013.

Darren Baysore, left, with his parents Thomas and Jamie, wanted to leave a light on so his father could see his way home from the moon. When Mrs Baysore published the request on Facebook, the story went viral, right

But since his campaign, Darren has regained some of the happiness in his life because of the support

Darren's mother Jamie helped with the plan establishing a heartwarming Facebook page outlining the details of the story. 

As a result of the campaign page, which has so far attracted more than 35,000 'likes', people from around the world posted images of their porches. 

When Darren was told of his father's death, his mother told him that Sgt Baysore would split his time between heaven and the moon so they would still be able to talk. 

As a result of that, Darren developed his idea to light up his area on the anniversary of his father's death so he would be able to see home. 

Mrs Baysore said she fully expected the people of Fort Campbell, such as this,  to get behind the campaign 

But as soon as the campaign went viral on the internet the family received support from around the globe 

Members of various emergency services sent photographs to show Darren they remembered his father 

According to The Tennessean, Mrs Baysore has been stunned by the reaction to her son's campaign. 

She said: 'We really had no idea Darren's request would go much beyond Clarksville and Fort Campbell. I mean, we expected a response for sure, but nothing like what happened.'

Mrs Baysore said the response to the campaign has even increased her son's faith in God. 

She wrote on the Shining Light Facebook page: 'Since my husband has been killed, Darren has not been to church but a few times because he is still upset about it and I choose as a mother to let him join on his own terms rather then forcing him and taking the chance of losing his faith forever. So with that being said, since this remembrance porch light has started and going around for the first time in about a year tonight Darren asked as I was walking out the room, "Mommy, can we pray?" 

'My heart melted and tears were about to come out. But I pulled it together and we prayed. As we prayed all I could do was thank God for answering my prayers and helping Darren to start finding his light again. I just needed to share this joy that I am feeling inside.'

Thousands of houses across the globe shone a light in memory of Staff Sgt Baysore who died in Afghanistan
