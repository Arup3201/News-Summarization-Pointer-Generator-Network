These are the stomach-churning images of a fearless daredevil who risks his life scaling Asia's tallest buildings without safety equipment.

Ivan Kuznetsov, who is originally from Russia, has reached the top of skyscrapers in both Hong Kong and Shanghai - carrying out his terrifying feats for no reason other than to have fun.

The 20-year-old, who calls his hobby 'rooftopping', said that he actually finds climbing quite difficult, and strongly recommends others do not to pick up the pastime due to the risks involved.

Unsurprisingly given the difficult climbs he has embarked on - including looking down on the 101-floor Shanghai World Finance Center - Mr Kuznetsov said he has never been scared of heights.

Instead he simply trusts in his own ability and tendency not to panic, which helps him stay calm while scaling buildings in all weather conditions - even ice covered scaffolding in the dead of winter.
