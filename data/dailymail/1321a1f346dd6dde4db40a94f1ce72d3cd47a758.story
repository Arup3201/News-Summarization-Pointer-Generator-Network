A convicted killer who died on death row in 2011 was responsible for more than 100 murders including those of JonBenet Ramsey and Jimmy Hoffa, a new book claims.

Retired cold case detective John Cameron, who helped bring suspects to trial in several murder cases, claims that Edward Wayne Edwards was also the Zodiac Killer and the Black Dahlia killer.

The astonishing claims are detailed in Cameron's new book, 'It's Me: Edward Wayne Edwards, the Serial Killer You Never Heard Of'.

Cameron says his investigations pin scores of murders to Edwards, who, in 2010, confessed to five killings dating back to 1977. These included his foster son, whom he killed for his $25,000 life insurance.

Murderer: Edwards, left, pictured in 2010, was sentenced to death but died of natural causes in 2011

He was sentenced to death but he passed away, aged 77, of natural causes just a month before he was to be executed.

Cameron worked for the Great Falls police force in Montana for 24 years, including 14 years specializing in cold case investigations, before retiring in 2005.

He went to work for the Montana Parole Board and when Edwards confessed to the killings in 2010, he realized there was a link between two of the murders and an unsolved murder in Great Falls, the Great Falls Tribune reported.

Edwards had confessed to killing a teenage couple who disappeared from a wedding reception in Wisconsin in 1980, where Edwards worked, and an Ohio couple in 1977.

The nature 
of the killings - shooting the lovers in the back of their heads - was 
similar to the unsolved killings of Patricia Kalitzke, 16, and Lloyd 
Bogle, 18, in 1956, Cameron thought.

Bogle
 was found bound up and shot in the back of the head in his car in a 
lovers lane, while Kalitzke's body was found miles away, also shot.

Author: Retired cold case detective John Cameron, pictured, investigated the case for four years

Cameron looked into the case and found that Deer Lodge Prison records indicated Edwards had arrived in Great Falls in January 1956 before he was arrested for a robbery that March.

'You have an admitted serial killer who was in town on the day that we have a double murder of a couple on lover’s lane in 1956,' Cameron told the Tribune. 'That's the evidence I have.'

DNA evidence from Kalitzke's body does not match Edwards', but Cameron said that he believed the sample had been contaminated.

Instead, he
 has pushed on with connecting the killer to unsolved cases - as well as
 cases that have been solved. In these, he believes the wrong person is 
serving time in prison.

'I
 was able to place him in Great Falls at the time of the murder, and 
from there it’s spiraled into following his life,' he said.

Cameron
 began reading a memoir written by Edwards in 1972 called 'Metamorphosis
 of a Criminal', and claims his whereabouts throughout that time place 
him near to the scenes of murders.

Victims? Cameron noticed that the crimes he confessed to bore similarities to the unsolved murders of Patricia Kalitzke and Lloyd Bogle, pictured, in 1956 and started investigating further possible connections

'The Great Falls murder was in there, and once I determined 
that, I decided to follow the whole book and see where else he killed, 
and it unraveled the worst serial killer that's ever been,' he told KRTV.

'It got to the point where it never stopped, and it just leading me and leading me.'

Cameron quit his parole board job to pursue the investigation and traveled across the country to interview Edwards' family members. 

From his 
four-year investigation, he concluded that Edwards is responsible for 
more than 100 deaths - which would make him the most prolific American 
serial killer of the last century, if true.

Cameron
 also believes Edwards is responsible for deaths linked to the Zodiac 
Killer during the 1960s and 1970s in northern California.

He
 adds that Edwards is responsible for the killings of child beauty queen
 JonBenet Ramsey in Boulder, Colorado in 1996 and union leader Jimmy 
Hoffa, who vanished in 1975 aged 62.

Did he kill them? Cameron claims he also killed child beauty pageant star JonBenet Ramsey, left, who was killed in Colorado in 1996, and Jimmy Hoffa, right, who vanished from Detroit in 1975

Murdered: Cameron also says he was responsible for the murder of the Zodiac Killer in northern California in the 1960s and 1970s, including victims Betty Lou Jensen (left) and Darlene Ferrin (right)

On his website, Cameron claims that 'Edwards had been killing children his entire life' and in Ramsey's case, he left behind a false ransom note as he had been doing for years.

'The JonBenet ransom note was a parable of Edwards' life of killing,' he explained.

Cameron also explains that in 1978, Edwards was interviewed by FBI agents about the murder of Hoffa and he fled shortly afterwards

Cameron said he knows some people do not believe his version of events.

'I didn't allow things to come in unless the evidence really was there,' he said. 'As it played out, it got worse and worse and worse.'
