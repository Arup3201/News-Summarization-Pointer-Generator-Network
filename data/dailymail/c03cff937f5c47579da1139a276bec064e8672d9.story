Steve Bruce admitted he was physically and mentally exhausted and in need of a holiday — but it may have to be a short one.

The exertions of keeping Hull City in the Barclays Premier League and negotiating a route to the FA Cup final took a heavy toll on the former Manchester United centre back, who looked as if he had thrown himself into every header and tackle on Saturday.

It was an energy-sapping end to an afternoon which started high on promise but ultimately just failed to deliver. How close Bruce’s side came, though, thanks to the manager’s canny tactical approach in the face of so many obstacles.

Salute: Bruce acknowledges the fans, who gave him, and Hull, superb backing during, and after, the final

Beating relegation has already enhanced Bruce’s reputation this season, to the extent that most neutrals would have been rooting for his team at Wembley.

Pushing Arsenal all the way —despite missing Nikica Jelavic and Shane Long, both cup-tied — added another impressive bullet point to his managerial c.v.

In the end, Hull surrendered an early 2-0 lead. They now face a fixture schedule that allows little scope for recharging batteries and will be a further test of Bruce’s management skills.

After succumbing to Aaron Ramsey’s extra-time winner, Hull will now enter next season’s Europa League at the third qualifying round stage on either July 29 or 30.

It sent a shudder through Bruce, who will start an urgent summer recruitment drive by trying to turn Tottenham midfielder Jake Livermore’s loan move into a permanent deal for around £7million.

‘We’ve got European football now, and we are going to have to try and enjoy it,’ he said with a wry chuckle. ‘Whether we’ve got the resources and bank power, I ain’t so sure.

‘There are all sorts of rules, and we’ve only got 21 players to pick from at the moment. We’ve got a game in July, and we will have played four times by the end of August, and I’m not sure we’re quite ready for that.

Break time: The Hull boss says he needs to take a break from football before planning for next season

Hull will enter the Europa League in the third qualifying round on July 31 along with European giants Lyon and PSV Eindhoven.

Their tie is unlikely to be glamorous though — they are likely to face the likes of JK Sillamae Kalev from Estonia, FC Shirak from Armenia or Sioni Bolnisi from Georgia.

Tottenham, who finished sixth in the Premier League, join a round a later for the play-offs while Everton join the competition in the group stages.

As for lucky Manchester United, they can enjoy Thursday nights free of the Europa League.  Mr Van Gaal will be pleased.

‘I’m completely gone, and need to get away, so I will tackle all that when I get back. But we have to make sure this isn’t the end of the story, after all we’ve done and all we put into this final, and that is the challenge for us now.

‘How many players do we need? Certainly five or six. We landed two or three really big ones, like Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore — who we hope to secure as our player now after having him on loan.

'But it’s an ongoing process, and there are out-of-contract players to sort out as well. There’s a lot to be done to make sure we are ready to go again, but I need a break first. I’m absolutely b****cksed!’

It is a quick turnaround for Bruce, and other clubs’ retained lists may prove required poolside reading at his holiday retreat, but his players are convinced he will come up with all the answers. Their faith in him is unshakeable.

‘People go on about second- season syndrome in the Premier League, but the gaffer will make sure we don’t suffer from that,’ said defender James Chester.

‘That’s what he’s paid for, and he has done really well in the last two transfer windows.

Perfect start: Bruce celebrates going in front at Wembley, but Hull were unable to hang on against Arsenal

‘He signed players who kept us up, and what we have achieved has to act as a springboard. There can be no going backwards, but there won’t be.

'The gaffer won’t allow it.We all expect to see a few new faces when we return, and that’s just what we need to cope with the extra demands next season. It is going to give everyone a lift.

‘Getting something sorted out with Jake would be a good start. He’s been massive for us. I’d not seen a lot of him before, but once he came here, he hit it off straightaway. Hopefully there’s a deal to be done there.’

There is an uncomplicated bluntness about Bruce that brings the best out of players who might not be automatic choices at other Premier League clubs.

They know where they stand and what is expected, and it shone through again, as he looked back on one of the most dramatic and enthralling finals of recent times.

He could have taken comfort from his unfancied side running Arsenal so close and playing a full part in a two-hour classic that was compelling viewing even as late as the 116th minute, when substitute Sone Aluko reached the ball a split-second before Arsenal keeper Lukasz Fabianski on the left touchline but steered his angled shot agonisingly wide of a gaping goal.

In the final analysis, though, they fell short, and that was all that  mattered.

P*** all: Bruce says the medal he received from Prince William for coming second is meaningless

Being able to hold heads high didn’t come close to atoning for not being able to lift the first trophy of his managerial career.

Asked if there might be a cup with his name on it one day, Bruce replied: ‘I thought it might have been this one. I couldn’t have asked more of my players, and it looked like we might do it. It has taken me 16 years to get to this stage, but it wasn’t to be.

‘To me, it’s no consolation that we have contributed so much to a final that will live long in the memory. None whatsoever.

'It doesn’t make it any better or easier to accept. There is no satisfaction in coming so close. It means p***-all. A loser’s medal doesn’t sit well with me.’
