Former Brazilian FIFA World Cup star Adriano has been charged over his alleged connection to drug trafficker in his native Rio de Janeiro.

Prosecutors claim the 32-year-old former footballer bought a motorbike and gave it to a known drug dealer in the shantytown where he grew up. 

It is understood the former striker could face up to ten years in prison if convicted.

Prosecutors on Tuesday did not request Adriano's arrest but asked him to surrender his passport because the player has enough money to try to flee the country.

Adriano and his lawyers could not be immediately contacted for comment.

The 32-year-old forward reportedly has been negotiating with second-division French club Le Havre to return to football after several months without a club. He traveled to France recently to meet with club officials, and French media reported that a deal was close.

Adriano played a few games with Brazilian club Atletico Paranaense earlier this year after being out of action for nearly two years because of injuries and off-field problems.

The former striker has been in negotiation with French team Le Harve about resuming his professional career

He began his career with Flamengo and played for Inter Milan and AS Roma, among other clubs. He won four Serie A titles with Inter Milan early in his career, and with Brazil he won the 2004 Copa America and the 2005 Confederations Cup.

He was in the starting lineup for Brazil at the 2006 World Cup, when the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals. Adriano was touted to make the team in 2010 in South Africa after leading Flamengo to the national title a year earlier, but was not included in the final squad. 

His last match for Brazil was in 2010.

Brazilian police claim Adriano bought the motorbike in 2008 and registered it in the name of Paulo Rogerio de Souza Paz, a known drug dealer. 

Paz, known as Mica, was believed to have been part of the Red Command which controlled the favela where Adrianon had grown up. 

Police believe that the motorbike had been used to transport drugs through the area. 

When the allegations first surfaced, Adriano denied the claims.

Prosecutors have ordered Adriano, pictured, to hand over his passport while the investigation continues
