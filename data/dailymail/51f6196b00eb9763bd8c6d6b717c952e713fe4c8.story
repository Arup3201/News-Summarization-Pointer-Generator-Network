The mother on trial for the murder of her twin newborns told police they drowned in the toilet after she gave birth to them, before eventually breaking down and admitting she smothered them to stop them from crying.

Lindsey Lowe, 26, from Hendersonville, Tennessee, was taken into custody after her father discovered one of the baby's tiny bodies in the laundry basket of her bedroom.

He called 911 and police picked Lindsey up at the dental office where she worked.

It was only when she was being questioned that authorities found out there were in fact two babies, after Lindsey eventually revealed this to the officer in charge of questioning her.

Evidence: The video of Lowe's police interview and eventual confession was played to the court today

Testimony: Detective Steve Malach takes to the witness stand at the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe today

The jury today were shown a tape of the lengthy interview on the third day of the murder trial.

Lowe is accused of keeping her 
pregnancy a secret, giving birth on the toilet, smothering the twin boys
to death and hiding their bodies in the laundry basket at her parent's 
affluent home in September 2011.

During the first half of the 
interview, Lowe explained briefly what happened to Detective Steve Malach, 
telling him she had been having back pain and shooting pains the day of 
the births and it was only when she went to the toilet later - because 
she thought she was having a 'bowel movement' - that she realized she was 
giving birth.

She explained that the first baby fell
into the toilet and she left him there and did not check on him, yet 
said she was sure he was dead. She said the same thing happened to the 
second baby.

The detective pressed her on how much 
the babies were under water and if they had been crying.

It was only 
when he told her that an autopsy would reveal exactly how the babies 
died did she breakdown and confess to smothering them.

Sobbing uncontrollably, Lowe said she 
did not want her 'conservative Christian parents' hearing the newborns 
cry so she put her hand over the first baby's mouth for 'a few minutes' 
until he stopped crying.

She did the same with his twin brother, the 
court heard. 

When the officer asked her, 'You knew you killed the babies?' She replied, 'Yes.'

Breakdown: Lindsey Lowe sobbed in court yesterday as grizzly details of the murder of her newborn twins were revealed to the jury

Scene: The newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, at the two-story home in the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville, about 20 miles northeast of Nashville

Dumped: The court was shown grizzly pictures of the laundry basket in which the dead newborns had been discarded by Lowe after she gave birth to them and smothered them

Blood: The bathroom were Lowe gave birth to her twins while she was on the toilet and then smothered them to stifle their screams

Grizzly discovery: Police find the tiny bodies of the newborn twin boys

Though she told the detective at the very beginning of the interview the father was her fiance, she later admitted she had had an affair with a man called Jeremy Smith and that he was likely the father.

Though she never took a pregnancy test to confirm what she expected, Lowe said she gained weight, her periods had stopped and she began lactating towards the end of the gestation period.

When questioned about why she didn't tell anyone or seek any help, she revealed she was too shocked and too scared of what both her fiance might think and her parents, who she described as 'very conservative, Christian people'.

Lowe admits to the detective that she never checked on the babies after she dumped their bodies in the laundry and didn't even look at what their sex was.

Yesterday, two police officers choked 
up while testifying about how they discovered the twin boys after the 
father of Lindsey Lowe, 26, from , called 911 after making the grizzly 
discovery.

Officer Jeremy Fentress took the stand
on Tuesday and described entering the bedroom of defendant Lindsey Lowe
and pulling back a bloody towel.

He stopped speaking for a few seconds, then told the court: 'After I pulled the bloody towel back, I saw a deceased infant.'

Fentress said he touched the baby with two fingers and found the infant was cold and not breathing.

The
newborn was the first of two found on September 14, 2011, in the 
two-story home of the upper-middle-class neighborhood in Hendersonville,
about 20 miles northeast of Nashville.

The
second baby was found by Sgt James Garrett, who described getting ready
to lay the first baby down on a bed 'softly and gently' before he 
discovered the umbilical cord, still attached to something deeper in the
basket.

Fentress held the
body of the first baby while Garrett pulled aside a sheet to uncover 
the second one – who was also dead. Garrett said he placed the first 
baby back in the basket beside his brother.

Lowe is facing two counts of first-degree murder at her trial, which opened Monday.

Jailed: Lindsey Lowe, now 26, faces to murder charges for her newborn twin sons but prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty

She had told police she gave birth to 
the twin boys in the bathroom of the home on the night of September 12, 
2011, and smothered them so that her parents would not hear their cries.

Both sides in the case agree that Lowe did not act like a pregnant woman in the days and weeks leading up to the birth.

Defense attorney John Pellegrin told 
jurors Lowe was a bridesmaid in a wedding the weekend before the birth 
where she was dancing, laughing and posing for pictures.

The night before the births, one of 
her sorority sisters stayed at her house, even sleeping in Lowe's bed, 
he said. And yet no one knew she was pregnant.

Prosecutors suggested that a lack of preparations showed Lowe never intended for the babies to live.

'Officers, during their search of the 
house, found no evidence of an expectation of life,' Assistant District 
Attorney Blanton said during opening statements.

'There were no diapers, no pacis (pacifiers), no blankets, no car seat.'

They pointed out that Lowe had been 
engaged to her college sweetheart in 2011, but had gotten pregnant when 
she had an affair with another man - who DNA tests later showed was the father of the twins.

'Miss Lowe made no preparation for the
births of these children because no one was going to interfere with her
life,' Blanton said in opening statements.

But defense attorneys argued that the case was not so simple.

Defense: Her attorney John Pellegrin, seen at her side in an earlier hearing, is arguing that she did not know that she was pregnant and was not of sound mind when she smothered the newborns to death

Court: Jury selection in the murder trial of Lindsey Lowe started Monday. She has pleaded not guilty

Diminished capacity: Defense lawyers' requests to have psychologists testify as to Lowe's mental state when she gave the statement were denied

'Lindsey Lowe was pregnant, but she refused to accept it, her mind refused to accept it,' Pellegrin said.

He argued that Lowe didn't realize what was happening when she started to give birth in the bathroom.

'She thinks her internal organs are coming out,' he told the jury.

Family, friends and church members have come to Lowe's defense.

In earlier hearings, Lowe's father 
Mark Lowe described her as a 'model daughter,' saying she moved back in 
with her family after graduating from Western Kentucky University in 
2008 and took care of her mother, who had a brain tumor.

The final witness Tuesday was Detective Steve Malach, who interviewed Lowe after the babies were discovered.

He testified how Lowe told him she gave birth and then put the babies in a laundry basket.

When he asked if she ever checked on them, 'she said she couldn't face it,' he told jurors.

If convicted of first-degree murder, 
Lowe could face life in prison without parole. Prosecutors had said 
previously they would not seek the death penalty.

Testimony continues Wednesday.
