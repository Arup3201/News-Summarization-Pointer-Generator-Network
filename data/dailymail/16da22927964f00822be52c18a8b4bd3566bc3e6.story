Authorities say a puppy taking a walk on a Massachusetts beach with its owner uncovered a human bone, which led to the discovery of several others.

Bill Barrett of Newbury was walking his chocolate Labrador retriever named Tessa Saturday morning on Plum Island Beach when the puppy made an unusual discovery.

Barrett says a woman looking through debris on the beach initially found the remains.

'She called me over and said what do you think this is? It was a good sized bone. I said it looks like a leg bone,' Barrett told CBS Boston.

That's when Tessa the puppy started digging nearby and spotted another bone, which appeared to be a leg as well.

'We walked over there, and I said "no leave it." It was the lower half of the leg with foot still attached, sock on the foot.'

Barrett told WCVB that it was difficult to tell, but that the leg appeared to belong to a male judging by the sock size.

Investigators with cadaver dogs later found several more bones. Police on Sunday confirmed the bones are human. Processing the remains is expected to take several days

Essex district attorney's spokeswoman Carrie Kimball Monahan tells the Globe that police are investigating and will be looking at missing-person's cases to try to identify the remains.
