Charged: Shaquille Jones, 21, was charged with murder and two first-degree home invasion

A man from South Carolina has been charged with the mysterious murder of a medical student in Michigan.

Shaquille Jones has been charged with the murder of Paul DeWolf, but police have not released any information about what led them to arrest Jones.

The 21-year-old also faces two counts of first degree home invasion in connection to the burglary next door to the fraternity house where DeWolf was found shot dead in his bedroom.

The Detroit Free Press reported that police in North Charleston, South Carolina were given a tip that Jones was wanted in connection to the Ann Arbor home invasion.

He was arrested on November 5 and a second suspect- identified as 20-year-old Joei Jordan- now faces a charge of receiving and concealing stolen property.

What that property was and his possible connection to Jones remains undisclosed.

Only one of the two suspects is thought to have any previous connection to the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and even there they did not disclose which one that was.

The arrests come as the first break in the case in months as DeWolf was discovered dead from a gunshot wound in his own bedroom at a the fraternity house that he shared with other medical students in Ann Arbor on July 24.

Victim: Paul DeWolf was found dead in his bedroom in a fraternity house in Ann Arbor, Michigan on July 24

His room was neat and tidy and no valuables had been removed when his body was found at around 11pm.

Involved: Joei Jordan, 20, was also arrested but charged with the lesser crime of receiving and concealing stolen property

Following
the murder investigation, the University of Michigan increased campus 
patrols and warned students that a killer may be on the loose.

The
university is taking 'all necessary steps to assure the safety of the 
campus community,' said University of Michigan President Mary Sue 
Coleman to ABC News.

Joshua DeWolf said his brother was excited about beginning a military career after graduation in May 2014.

'His life came to an end in his prime,' Joshua DeWolf said to Ann Arbor News.

'I have no tears for him,' Thom DeWolf, Paul's father, said at his funeral on Sunday. 'He is released. He is in heaven.'

DeWolf
is an enlisted second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was
studying at university to complete his surgical training.

He was in his fourth year of studying and graduated from Grand Valley State University in Allendale three years prior.

Another of his close friends, Jason Halterman said that DeWolf had an infectious love of life.

'He loved everyone regardless,' said Halterman to ABC News.

'He taught me to be a better, more caring person and I love him for it.'

DeWolf was a frequent poster to Facebook about his passion for scuba diving and running marathons.

He was the captain of the cross country team at Schoolcraft High School and graduated as class valedictorian in 2006.

He
took his bachelors degree in bio-medical sciences from Grand Valley 
State University in 2010 and then joined the Air Force - where he was in
the top ten percent certified in officer training.

He belonged to Sigma Phi Epsilon at Grand Valley State University and Phi Rho Sigma Fraternity at the University of Michigan.

Police say DeWolf failed to arrive for a scheduled assignment at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital. The hospital sent a colleague to the home to check on him, and that person discovered DeWolf had died - He was an enthusiastic marathon runner too

DeWolf
was a brilliant piano and French horn player, was a certified scuba 
diver, traveled the world on several mission trips, and had competed in 
marathons. He was a devout Christian.

A statement from the university said that DeWolf was the 'epitome of everything great in the field of medicine.'

'We extend our deepest condolences to Paul's family, friends and colleagues,' UM president Coleman added to the statement.

'He
was working and training among a close, nurturing community of healers 
and I know they will help each other through this difficult time. They 
will need the support of the broader campus community in the weeks and 
months ahead, and we will provide it.'
