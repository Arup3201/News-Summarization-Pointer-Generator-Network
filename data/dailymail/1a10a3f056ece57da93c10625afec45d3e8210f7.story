Farzana Ahmed leaving Chester Crown Court. She and her husband are charged with killing their daughter Shafilea, 17, in 2003

A mother accused of suffocating her daughter for defying her parents’ strict Pakistani culture yesterday denied playing any part in killing her.

However Shafilea Ahmed’s mother Farzana said her husband Iftikhar – who allegedly held a plastic bag in the 17-year-old’s mouth until she stopped breathing – had been violent towards their daughter in the past.

Mrs Ahmed, 49, who is accused of starting the murderous attack with the words ‘Just finish it here’, said he had slapped Shafilea twice for refusing to name a boy who had rung her mobile.

She also claimed Shafilea had been worried about being pressured into an arranged marriage before a family trip to Pakistan, but insisted there had been no such plan.

Yesterday the couple’s murder trial at Chester Crown Court heard for the first time from Mrs Ahmed, who spoke in Punjabi through an interpreter.

She has always denied murder, but earlier this month the jury heard  she had changed her account of the evening in question.

She now says she witnessed her 52-year-old husband hitting Shafilea that night, although she did not see the killing.

She also claimed he had threatened to attack her and their other children if she ever asked him what had happened to Shafilea.

The jury heard she had undergone an arranged marriage to Iftikhar, her first cousin, in Pakistan, before settling in Britain. She said they first became aware that Shafilea was secretly meeting boys when she was 16 in November 2002.

She and her husband challenged Shafilea over the identity of ‘a male’ who repeatedly rang her mobile phone, but she would not tell them. Asked how her husband responded, she answered: ‘He slapped her twice.’ The case continues.

Since 2003, she had always supported her husband's claim that Shafilea had run away from home after a row about her Western clothes and her relationships with boys.

The prosecution claim that both parents suffocated Shafilea with a plastic bag before Iftikhar drove the body to be dumped in the Lake District.

Mrs Ahmed, wearing a black headscarf, gave evidence through a Punjabi interpreter and was asked by her barrister Mukhtar Hussain QC about Shafilea's death.

The jury heard Mrs Ahmed tell the court Shafilea's father Iftikhar was the last person to see her alive

The prosecution has alleged that Shafilea was murdered for becoming 'Westernised'

Today, the court heard evidence from Mrs Ahmed who spoke with the aid of an interpreter.

Mukhtar Hussain QC, defending Mrs Ahmed, asked: 'Did you kill Shafilea, your daughter?'

Mrs Ahmed, wearing a back head scarf and purple cardigan, responded: 'No.'

Mr Hussain asked: 'Did you play any part in her killing?'

Mrs Ahmed said: 'No.'

He added: 'Did you see Shafilea being killed?'

Mrs Ahmed again replied: 'No.'

She said the last time she had seen Shafilea was on September 11 2003.

Mr Hussain said: 'And who was the last person to see her alive on September 11?'

The defendant replied: 'My husband.'

In addition to changing her statement about her husband hitting Shafilea, Mrs Ahmed also
claimed he had threatened to do the same to her and their other 
children if she ever asked him what had happened to Shafilea.

It was not until last year that 
Shafilea’s younger sister, Alesha Ahmed, provided the 'final piece of 
the puzzle' about her death, the prosecution said, when she disclosed 
that she witnessed her parents killing Shafilea at the family home.

Alesha
described how her parents pushed Shafilea onto the settee in their 
house and she heard her mother say 'Just finish it here' as they forced a
plastic bag into the teenager’s mouth and suffocated her in front of 
their other children.

The couple allegedly murdered their 'Westernised' daughter because they believed her conduct was bringing shame on the family, the prosecution said.

Alesha’s version of events appear to have been corroborated in writings her sister Mevish gave to a friend in 2008, which emerged shortly after the start of the trial.

Mevish told the jury the writings were 'fiction' and that her parents played no part in Shafilea’s death.

Mr and Mrs Ahmed both deny murder.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
