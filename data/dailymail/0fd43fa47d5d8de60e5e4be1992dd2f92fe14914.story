A mother-of-one has told of the horrifying moment she and her family checked into a hotel room on the New South Wales' Central Coast, which she described as a 'crime scene'.

Sydney woman Melanie, her partner and seven-year-old son booked two nights at the Apollo Resort in Wamberal from February 13 to attend a friend's wedding on booking.com.

The cost of staying at the resort was $285 in total.

Melanie and her family checked into the Apollo Resort in Wamberal, NSW and found two pairs of dirty underwear

The first signs of trouble came when the young family were escorted to their room up 'terribly old-looking staircase' and saw the dirty marks on the walls of the 'dimly lit hallway', which scared Melanie's son.

When they walked into their room the trio found an empty syringe packet on the floor, white stains on the floor and two pairs of dirty underwear in the bin.

But the nightmare did not end there.

Melanie said there was a used mini bottle of body wash in the soap tray in the bathroom, a filthy toilet bowl and 'a wasp nest cocoon inside the thick maroon curtains'.

The family also found an empty syringe packet on the floor near the bed inside the room

When they lifted up the sheets they found dry rice stuck to the blanket

'Out on the grubby balcony, there was a bottle cap on the ground from the previous guest, cigarette ash and dirt all over the ground, dirty tiles and incredibly cheap furniture - not a "resort" by any means,' she said.

'I walked into a spider web when opening the door so I turned my phone camera on to look for spiders and the underneath of the small, rusty table was infested with them.'

A strong smell of bleach wafted into the room, which Melanie assumed must of been from the 'green and un-swimmable' pool as described by other TripAdvisor reviews.

'Being five months pregnant, I couldn't stand the smell and quickly went back inside,' she said.

There were also white stains on the carpet. Melanie described the room as a 'crime scene'

The window sills were covered in dirt and dust, and looked like they had not been cleaned in a long time

The final straw was the airconditioner in the room, which smelt 'terrible' when it was turned on.

'My partner opened it up and the filters were full of dust. Our son has bad asthma so we turned it straight off and took a photo of it on my phone,' Melanie said.

'The furnishings were terrible, even the insides of the bedside lampshades were peeling and everything felt unclean. I did not want to touch anything.

'My son told me he was scared and the place was "creepy" and asked if we had to stay there.'

Then Melanie's partner found two pairs of underwear in the bin - a 'very worn-out pair of male jocks and a torn, small pink female G-string'.

'I wanted to vomit. We couldn't believe our eyes - no one deserves to go through that - the place should be closed down,' Melanie said.

The inside of the lamp was brown and grimy. Melanie said she did not want to touch anything

A small rusty table outside on the balcony was was infested with spiders and cobwebs

Daily Mail Australia has attempted to contact the Apollo Resort.

But owners of the hotel told news.com.au their staff cleaned rooms every day.

'In the past, the guests provided us a constructive comments or requests in the Comment Sheet in each of rooms or speak with us directly. We answer it quickly,' a spokesman said.

The saga of her trouble with Apollo Resort did not end there for Melanie who left the same day she checked-in.

Despite being told by the manager of the hotel she would not be charged a cancellation fee of $285.

She received an email the following morning saying the hotel would be charging them for being a 'no show.

Melanie found a used mini bottle of body wash on the soap dish inside the shower

There was brown scaling that had not been cleaned up at the bottom of the toilet

On the way up to the room, a dirty hand mark was seen on the wall of the hall way

'This seemed like a kick in the face from the nightmare we experienced. I immediately responded back to them, and included photos from my phone and explained that we did arrive, we did check-in, then checked back out within 30 minutes as it's not safe for patrons,' she said.

'A few emails went back and forth and eventually [on February 16] I have now received an email saying the hotel has advised we have been cancelled without penalty.'

But the incident is not an isolated one. Apollo Resort's TripAdvisor page is full of reviews slamming the hotel.

One woman labels it 'Fawlty Towers without Basil' while another reviewer says describing it as 'disgusting is an understatement'.

A user named Rochellemaree said her room had 'rodent poo everywhere'.

'Never have I been so disgusted,' she wrote.

'The staff member didn't seem at all surprised or alarmed and offered me another room.

'The airconditioning in the second room was broken and stuck on freezing all night. I had to sleep under a blanket from the second bed.

'The shower door and shower head were filthy and covered in mould.

'In the morning, I pulled out a chair to sit on and it was also covered in rodent faeces.'
