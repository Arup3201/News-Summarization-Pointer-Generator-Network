Rowena Browne, 33, from Cheshire, was left with a painful, oozing wound on her left cheek after a tooth abscess 'ate away' at her face

A woman claims she was left with a hole in her face when an abscess 'ate' into her cheek.

Rowena Browne's left cheek turned purple and became swollen before the 33-year-old noticed a wound had opened up and was oozing pus.

Miss Browne struggled to eat and suffered excruciating pain.

She has since taken legal action against her dentist, who paid £11,500 but did not admit liability.

'I was struggling to eat or open my jaw properly, the wound was visibly oozing and horrible,' Miss Browne said.

'People used to do a double take when they walked past me, and I was very self-conscious at work.

'I couldn't even kiss my boyfriend.' 

After seeking a second opinion, she was referred to a specialist dental hospital.

Miss Browne, who lives with her partner, Jonathan, 22, said: 'The swelling went down after about a month, and the wound started to heal, but the whole area was still very purple and red.

'I am having to look at a course of special fillers to try and balance it up and I may need surgery - it has been a devastating experience.'

The 33-year-old, from Northwich, Cheshire, noticed a swelling in her cheek in March 2011.

She visited her GP, who prescribed two courses of antibiotics. 

'They thought that maybe I had a stone in my saliva duct but the swelling didn't really subside and it was becoming painful too,' she said.

Miss Browne's GP then sent her to the dentist, who took X-rays and prescribed more antibiotics for a suspected abscess.

After she returned to her dentist a further three times she became concerned, and made an appointment at a different dental surgery.

'By the time I saw a different dentist, my cheek was bright purple and oozing pus. It was horrible, really painful and disgusting,' Miss Browne said.

'I could only open my mouth a little so eating and talking was difficult and kissing was out of the question.

'It made my job, in customer care, almost impossible and I was so self-conscious.

'The new dentist took one look at me and demanded to know who had been treating me. 

'She explained I had an abscess which had eaten into my sinus and she sent me straight to hospital to have my wisdom tooth removed.'

After seeking a second opinion, Miss Browne, right with her partner, was referred  to hospital to have her wisdom tooth, left, removed. The 33-year-old was paid £11,500 in compensation by her original dentist

After surgery, Miss Browne's face was swollen for a further month, and she decided to take legal action.

She recently settled the dispute with her dentist Dr Eva Quevedo, from Smiles Dental, with the dentist agreeing to pay an £11,500 settlement despite not admitting liability.

Oasis Dental Care, the company that owns Smile Dental, in Barnton, Cheshire, has confirmed Dr Quevedo continues to work at the clinic.

Julian Perry, Oasis Dental Care's clinical director, said: 'We are keen to reassure the public that Oasis Dental Care's number one priority is delivering clinical excellence to all patients.

'There are stringent standards in place for the recruitment and ongoing training of our dentists and other staff in order to provide exceptional care throughout Oasis.

'There have been no formal complaints raised to the General Dental Council (GDC) against the dentist, and we are working with her and the entire team at the practice to ensure that our rigorous standards in clinical excellence are met as Smiles Dental becomes part of Oasis Dental Care.

'As with all dentists working at Smiles Dental, the dentist is self-employed and continues to work at the practice.'
