Arjen Robben could face disciplinary action following his admission that he dived during Holland’s 2-1 victory over Mexico in the World Cup second round.

The Dutch winger confessed to simulation during the first half – when he flopped inside the penalty area - but insisted he had been fouled by Rafael Marquez in the incident which led to Klaas-Jan Huntelaar’s winning spot-kick in injury-time.

'I must apologise,' said Robben. 'The one [at the end] was a penalty, but the other one was a dive in the first half. I shouldn't be doing that. That’s awful.’

FIFA’s disciplinary code states that ‘anyone who violates the principles of fair play’ could face sanction, while article 96 says that audio and video recordings are permissible as forms of evidence, meaning Robben’s words and footage of his dive could well be reviewed.

Speaking in February of this year, FIFA president Sepp Blatter called for retrospective action to be taken against divers.

‘Video evidence can be used for serious breaches of the principle of fair play such as brawling, spitting at opponents, verbal insults and racist slurs, or for incorrectly awarded red or yellow cards,’ he said.

'In cases such as these we must make use of the avenues already open to us and intervene after the event if necessary.

‘In this context, we should include the faking of injury, intentional diving or time wasting in our considerations.’

Meanwhile, Mexico boss Miguel Herrera branded Robben a cheat and criticised Portuguese referee Pedro Proenca for his performance.

'Out of four matches we had three where the refereeing was disastrous and this was the worst,' said Herrerra.

'Robben did three dives for penalties that didn’t exist. He had to be cautioned. If you do that to the guy who tries to cheat, then he can’t cheat again.

'Robben should have got a second card. If you don’t do anything as a referee, the player carries on. He knows he won’t be expelled from the pitch so he carries on.

'But then when they send a referee from the same confederation where they have a team, this is what happens.

'The referee gave a penalty that was invented by him. The least we can hope is that this gentleman goes home just like us.’
