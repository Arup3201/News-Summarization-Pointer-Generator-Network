This is the chilling moment two killers tried to pull their victim's severed leg out of a boat propeller after pushing him overboard and deliberately running him over.

Paul Gerlach, 51, and Louis Borzoni, 50, got into a drink-fuelled argument with 30-year-old Rico Dardis as they cruised on a speedboat off the coast of Christchurch Bay in Dorset.

They pushed the father-of-one overboard, before running him over with the boat's propeller - ripping both of his legs from his body.

They were later spotted trying to unclog the propeller of Gerlach's Maxum speedboat, 'No Chance', after returning to shore.

A
 shocking photograph, taken by a beach-goer, shows Gerlach looking over 
the side of the boat while a blood-soaked Borzoni can be seen checking 
the stern.

As they examined the vessel, a passing couple noticed a torso 
floating in the sea and asked the pair what it was, to which Borzoni replied: 'Oh, maybe it's a dummy'.

Police
 were called and Mr Dardis's dismembered body was discovered floating in
 the surf, while one of his legs was found entangled in the boat's 
propeller.

Victim: Mr Dardis, a father-of-one and an aspiring rapper, had both of his legs ripped off by the boat's propeller

Now, Gerlach and Borzoni have been jailed for life after being found guilty of murder at Winchester Crown Court.

Sentencing the pair, the Honourable Mr Justice Blake told them the last thing Mr Dardis would have heard before he died would have been the sound of a propeller approaching.

'Neither of you have shown any remorse for his (Mr Dardis’) death,' he said. 'You have shown a callous disregard for his dignity as a human being.

'You, Mr Gerlach, deliberately drove the boat over him causing catastrophic injuries.

'You, Mr Borzoni, were aware of what he was going to do and were in agreement with it.

'You have deprived a family of a son and a nine-year-old of a father and that relationship and guidance for the rest of his life.'

At an earlier hearing, the court heard that a fight had broken out between Gerlach, Borzoni and Mr Dardis, who had been drinking vodka and beer, on May 27 last year.

Mr Dardis, described as a 'talented freestyle rapper' by his family, was pushed off the back of the speedboat into the sea, before Gerlach turned the boat round, 'whacked the throttle down' and ran into him.

At around 9pm, families relaxing at Christchurch Bay called the police 
after spotting Gerlach and Borzoni acting suspiciously onboard the 
broken boat as they returned to shore.

Far
 from calling for help, the pair were trying to unclog the propeller, before walking away laughing and joking, jurors were told.

After abandoning the vessel, Gerlach and Borzoni took a taxi to nearby Southbourne to purchase more alcohol, the court heard. 

During the
 journey, the taxi driver questioned them about the blood on their 
clothing, to which they replied: ‘Yeah, we murder’, before adding ‘Ha, 
just joking’.

The pair were arrested after driving 
back to the car park - where they had left a bag containing a bloody 
towel and a meat cleaver - at around 10pm.

Court: Gerlach and Borzoni have been jailed for life at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) after being found guilty of murder. Gerlach was sentenced to a minimum term of 17 years, while Borzoni was given 15 years

Both defendants were later secretly taped confessing to the murder - Gerlach to his estranged wife and Borzoni to his brother.

Gerlach claimed Mr Dardis’ death had been an accident, while Borzoni chose not to give evidence.

Gerlach, of no fixed address, was sentenced to life in jail with a minimum term of 17 years. Borzoni, from Boscombe, must serve a 15-year minimum term.

Mr Dardis's relatives, who sat in court for the sentencing, said in a statement: 'Rico was a loving, caring son, brother and dad.

'We have been blessed to have had him in our lives. The horrific way Rico lost his life will stay with us forever. It has been the most difficult an heartbreaking time of our lives.

'But his light and spirit will live on, and we will make him proud and remain strong as a family unit.'
