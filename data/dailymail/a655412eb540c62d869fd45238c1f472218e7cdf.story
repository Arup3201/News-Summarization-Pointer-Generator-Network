A grieving student has won two awards for her heart-wrenching documentary about her mother and two brothers who were killed by a car while crossing the road.

Sophie Piggott, now 20, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, documented her father's struggle to bring her up alone and has scooped the Best Documentary Short prizes at both the Suffolk Film Festival and Screen Stockport Film Festival.

Her mother, heavily pregnant Sarah Piggott, 42, died with her seven-year-old son Simon and her unborn child Sullivan when they were hit at 50mph in 2006.

Sarah, who was due to be induced the 
next day, had gone to collect Simon from school when they were mown 
down by pub landlord Christopher Ballantyne.

Ballantyne, 35, was convicted of causing death by careless driving and was ordered to pay costs of £1,000 and banned from the road for 12 months.

The tragedy happened yards from the family home on June 26, 2006.

Sarah's distraught husband Steve was left to bring up the couple's other three children Sophie, 13, and brothers Sam, 16 and Scott, 10.

Sophie has now scooped two national awards after she made a poignant film - called '26' after the date of the tragedy - for a university project.

The six-minute documentary stars Sophie's dad Steve, now 54, talking about his love for his wife of 22 years while watching a video of their wedding day.

He also told how he cradled his son stillborn Sullivan after he was delivered.

Fighting back tears, the electrical wholesaler says: 'Sarah was just crossing the road with Simon when a car struck them. 

'Simon was killed instantly and Sarah was very badly injured. 

'Bearing in mind she was overdue on the Tuesday she was due to be induced. 

'After the accident they delivered Sullivan as a still born baby and they allowed me to cuddle him and to look at him in my arms you would just think he was asleep. 

'I took the kids to see them in the chapel of rest and that was the first time I saw Simon.'

Steve then needs a moment and tells the camera, 'I'll be alright. Give me a minute.'

He then adds: 'They moved him for me so Simon and Sullivan were closer to Sarah. 

'Simon was wearing his hat because he had severe head injuries.'

Devoted Steve also affectionately tells how he proposed to Sarah just weeks after the started going out.

He says: 'I remember it to this day and remember seeing her.

'I said something and she said "are you asking me to marry you" and I said "I suppose I am". 

'That was only a few weeks after we started going out so it happened by accident so to speak. 

'It was a fantastic day [their wedding day], the sun was out and it was an absolutely gorgeous day, I can remember it now.

'She [Sarah] was always a family-orientated lady. 

'Sam was a bit of a milestone, as they always are and he makes friends so, so easily. 

'Then Sophie is my only daughter, Scott has just turned 17, his only downfall is he is a Man City supporter, I suppose someone has got to be.'

The film - which also shows clips of Sullivan's ultrasound scan - has been awarded Best Documentary Short at both the Suffolk Film Festival and the Screen Stockport Film Festival.

Sophie, who is studying her third year in Media Film Production at Staffordshire University, said she wanted to make the film as a lasting legacy to her family.

She said: 'I wanted to wait until I was ready, it was difficult to do and when we showed it to whole class at the end of the semester people were quite shocked because obviously you don't always talk about things like this so not many of them knew. 

'I think a few people were in tears having seen it. It was really tough for me to watch dad's interview through and edit it. 

'It took about four months in total to do and when I had to edit it I just sat in the corner of the editing suite with tears flooding out. 

'It is obviously still terrible to deal with but time does technically heal. 

'This is what I want to do anyway, I want to make documentary films. 

'My dad is proud of me and I've made something I am pleased with. 

'Mum told me I could do whatever I wanted as long as I was happy so I know she would be pleased too.'

Sam, 23, and Scott, 17, also appear on film watching home movie clips while talking fondly about their mum and brother.

Steve added: 'At first I was happy to do it but I didn't want to see the finished article because I thought it would be too much.

'But I am so glad I have seen it, Sophie has done it in such a delicate way and it is really well done. 

'The whole family has seen it now and all think it is great. 

'Sarah would be so immensely proud of the video and it is just nice to look at the happy memories.'I have learnt not to put things off until tomorrow, of course we have all learnt that the hard way. If you have got a dream follow it.'
