Auctioneers are offering the chance to snap up a truly unique piece of property - after putting 1.4 acre private island on Florida's Caloosahatchee River up for sale.

The small, densely-wooded island in Fort Myers, Florida, is a 30 second boat ride away from the mainland and is up for sale for just four days as part of an online auction.

And while the island boasts 'breathtaking 360 degree riverfront views and proximity to luxury waterfront estate homes,' developers would also need a substantial amount of spare cash as the land has no buildings or utilities.

Unique property: The unnamed piece of land on Florida's Caloosahatchee River boasts 1.4 acres of land with enviable surroundings

For sale: The island, pictured bottom left in this aerial shot of Fort Myers, has no buildings but has been valued at $42,000

Under current zoning laws, the highest bidder for the island will be able to build a single family home on the island, along with other facilities such as a boat house or dock.

Records state that the swordfish-shaped island has an estimated value of $42,000, as well as 'deep water access to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean'.

Ideal location: Auctioneers have boasted that the property has 'deep water access to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean'.

Lamar Fisher, president of the Fisher Auction Company, who is presiding over the sale, told ABC News: 'The auction itself is called absolute, meaning the property will sell to the highest and most successful bidder.'

The auction started on Monday at 10am, and will close on Thursday at 2pm.

While the island is undoubtedly unique
in terms of its views and location, the buyer would need a fair amount 
of spare cash to develop their dream riverside home.

Mr
Fisher added: 'If you want to build a home, you'll need to put in your 
well, your septic, your electric. Those are your basic utilities.

'It truly is a virgin island.

'I don't think anybody has had the opportunity to sell an island like this.'

The island is currently nameless, but has the address 14700 Island 1, Caloosahatchee River, Fort Myers, Florida, 33905.

It is being sold on behalf of Pan American Fund LLC, who claimed it back from its previous owners in 2008.

It
is thought the previous owners had intended to build a Bed & 
Breakfast on the island but lacked sufficient funding to see the project
through.

Piece of paradise: The island does not have any utilities or buildings, meaning buyers would need substantial spare cash
