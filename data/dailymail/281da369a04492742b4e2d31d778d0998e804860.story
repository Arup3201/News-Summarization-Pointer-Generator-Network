Nothing can beat a family picnic in the sunshine but when compared to 30 years ago our tastes could not be any different.

In 1982 the traditional sandwich, cocktail sausage and dairylea triangles were kings and queens of the British outdoor lunch but now these have been binned for some sushi and chorizo.

A new study comparing our shopping habits over 30 years show we have gone 'posh' when we head to the park or beach with our loved-ones or friends for something to eat.

Now we like spinach and filo parcels, some fresh ciabatta and an international cheese board from a wicker basket

Gone are the days when we would pull out some cheese and pineapple on sticks or fishfingers and white rolls from some tupperware.

Instead it is spinach and filo parcels, some fresh ciabatta and an international cheese board from a wicker basket.

And while the items in 1982 were almost all from Britain, now the average picnic has items from at least 11 countries around the world, from France, Spain and Greece to America, Mexico and India.

But there is one constant that us Britons still cannot resist that was a top ten item 30 years ago - the humble Melton Mowbray pork pie.

THEN

1. Sandwiches

2. White Bread

3. Cheese Triangles

4. Tomato Salad               

5. Sausages         

6. Fish Fingers 

7. Liver Sausage             

8. Cheese and Pineapple on Sticks

9. Pork Pie 

10. Tupperware with plastic cutlery

NOW

1.Mediterranean Salad

2. Ciabatta

3. Cheese Board    

4. Spinach and Feta Parcels

5. Chorizo

6.Sushi   

7. Grilled Halloumi Skewers

8. BBQ Pork Belly

9. Pork Pie 

10. Hamper with metal cutlery

Gail Paddy, Asda’s product development director, said: 'While the picnic
has been a constant in British life for years, we’ve noticed a growing 
trend for upmarket picnics.

'Years ago, picnics were all soggy sandwiches and rainy days out. The 
weather may not have changed but the make-up of the standard picnic is 
evolving.'

It appears that our picnics now are healthier than 30 years ago, as we are now eating less white bread and more fruit.

But Charlotte Stirling-Reed, of the Nutrition Society, said the picnics had positives and negatives.

'Both are likely to be high in salt and fat and, as they are 
lacking much in the way of fruit and vegetables, they are likely also to
be low in important vitamins and minerals. In the context of a 
nutrient-rich and well-balanced diet, these picnic foods are fine 
occasionally,' she said.

'But with unlimited amounts of food available today, it is also not hard
to fill our picnic basket with tasty food that is also beneficial for 
our health.'

Asda say that their hamper sales are up almost 50 per cent this year showing that the good old fashioned picnic, whatever people put in them, is more popular than ever.

Experts say this is still a cheap way to entertain friends or family during this recession.

Asda’s Vickie Rogerson said: 'A picnic is one way families are enjoying good food and a day out without breaking the bank.'
