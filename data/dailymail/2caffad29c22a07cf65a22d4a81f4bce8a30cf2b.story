A U.S. health authority poster claiming Ebola can be transmitted by droplets through the air has been removed from its website, prompting concerns the deadly virus can be caught through a sneeze. 

The poster, which caused alarm because it seems to go against medical advice that the virus cannot be transmitted by air, said Ebola could be contracted if someone came into contact with objects that had been sneezed on by people who were infected.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) poster said droplets, such as those from a sneeze, carried the virus and could remain infectious on surfaces for up to several hours.

Debate about government-imposed quarantines for people exposed to the virus has grown over the past few weeks, as isolated cases  are diagnosed in the U.S. and it continues to spread across West Africa.

So far, more than 4,900 people have been killed - the vast majority in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - in the deadliest outbreak of the virus on record.

The CDC poster, now removed, stated: 'Droplet spread happens when the germs traveling inside droplets that are coughed or sneezed from a sick person enter the eyes, nose or mouth of another person,' the New York Post reported.

It warned someone could become infected should they accidentally touch the sneeze droplets and then touch their eyes, nose or mouth.

Today, the CDC internet page dedicated to the subject stated it was being updated.

It read: 'The What’s the difference between infections spread through air or by droplets? Fact sheet is being updated and is currently unavailable. Please visit cdc.gov/Ebola for up-to-date information on Ebola.'

Medical experts have repeatedly stated the Ebola virus is not transmittable by air.

It is contracted when someone comes into contact with the body fluids, such as urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk and semen, of a person who is infected.

But experts have repeatedly warned of the frightening possibility the Ebola virus could mutate and become airborne.

Although the risk of it doing so is thought to be low, experts cannot discount it entirely.

Two weeks ago leading scientist Lord Robert Winston warned the risk of Ebola spreading could dramatically increase if it becomes airborne.

In a House of Lords debate, the fertility doctor demanded answers from the government about how closely they were monitoring the virus.

Lord Winston said: ‘We know that viruses mutate, we know that the Ebola virus can mutate.

‘We know perfectly well that it is not airborne at the moment, and we know that the pharyngeal and upper respiratory tract cells are unlikely to harbour the virus.

‘However, can you assure us that people are looking at the risk of mutation of this virus so that we can make certain that its mode of transmission does not change?'

And the chief of the UN’s Ebola mission, Anthony Banbury, also warned earlier this month that the virus could become airborne.

He said aid workers were racing against time to control the epidemic in case it mutates in a ‘nightmare scenario’.
