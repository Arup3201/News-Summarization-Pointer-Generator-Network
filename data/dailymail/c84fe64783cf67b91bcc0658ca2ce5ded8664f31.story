Case rejected: Footballer Ched Evans lost a challenge against his conviction for rape

Footballer Ched Evans has lost a challenge against his conviction for rape.

The former Sheffield United and Wales striker had his case rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London.

Today’s ruling was made by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Mitting and Mr Justice Griffith Williams.

The 23-year-old was jailed for five years in April for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room.

Evans denied the offence but was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court of raping her at a hotel in North Wales in May last year.

He admitted having sex with her but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident.

The prosecution said the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse.

Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, 23, who also admitted having sex with the victim, was found not guilty of the same charge.

Lord Judge, rejecting the conviction challenge by Evans, said: 'We can see no possible basis which would justify us interfering with the verdict of the jury, which heard all the evidence and reflected on it after careful summing up by the judge.'

The judges also threw out a bid by Evans to have his sentence reduced.

The news comes as nine people who illegally named the victim were told to pay her £624 each in compensation.

The nine, who included a woman teacher, posted messages on Twitter and Facebook accusing the 19 year old of being a ‘money-grabbing slut’ who had made up the attack.

Some are on benefits and will be able to pay the debt off at £6 a week – denying the teenager full compensation for two years.

Justice: The Royal Courts of Justice where the sentence from April this year was upheld

The teenager is said to have been traumatised by the heated online discussion after Ched Evans was convicted in April of raping her the previous May.

The nine posted the messages about her with ‘deliberate malice’ after the 23-year-old Wales and Sheffield United striker was jailed for five years for the hotel room assault.

The defendants appeared at Prestatyn Magistrates' Court in North Wales charged with publishing material likely to lead members of the public to identify the complainant in a rape case.

They claimed not to know that identifying a rape victim was a criminal offence.

The judge told the offenders they had identified the victim, some with abusive comments and others with ‘deliberate malice’.

He added: ‘You did so without proper knowledge of the facts and without any heed of the feelings of the victim.

‘Your actions have revictimised this 
woman again. It is not for you to take the law into your own hands as 
you did. In my view you best atone for what you have done by paying 
compensation.’

He ordered them to pay a total of £5,616 in compensation as their only punishment.
