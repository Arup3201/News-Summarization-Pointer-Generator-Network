They're not the usual dishes one thinks of when considering the tastes and palate of young children.

But in one restaurant in Cornwall, moules mariniere, wood fired pizzas, ratatouille, and crispy salt and pepper squid sit alongside more prosaic offerings such as burgers, and fish and chips.

The dishes served at Amélies in Porthleven were designed and approved by the restaurant owner's six-year-old daughter, after whom the restaurant is named.

The new menu was given the thumbs up by the child testers aged between two and eight-years-old

The eaterie's new kids' menu was devised entirely by Amélie Sheffield-Dunstan, who was aged just six months when the restaurant in Breageside in Porthleven, was opened by her mum Sam.

She loves nothing more than popping into the kitchen with head chef Paul James and often puts on her chef's whites and cooks at home. 

Ms Sheffield-Dunstan said: 'Amélie and I often cook together at home and dishes like our Mish Mash chicken with oodles of noodles were inspired by Amélie's home-cooked favourites.'

Each time Amélies launches a new menu the staff are invited to try the dishes so that they know what each tastes like and can ask any questions of the chef.

The new menu was launched with a tasting by the people who matter – the children. 

Amélie said: 'It was really fun having my friends here to share the food. I liked dinging the bell to get service to the kitchen!'

The dishes were a big hit with the kids, aged between two and eight who tucked into everything from pizzas and ratatouille to squid and locally landed fish.

Ruby Mitchell, aged 6, said, 'Amélies is brilliant. It's the best burger I've ever had and the pasta is yummy. Children's menu's are really great because they have chocolate and ice lollies after — I had a red flavoured one which was super delicious!'

Liam Atkinson, 6, added: 'Amélies is the best restaurant because I can meet all my friends here and we love the food.'

Ms Sheffield-Dunstan said: 'We're all about family at Amélies and we wanted to focus on the food we provide for kids being as special as what we plate up for the adults.

'That means attention to detail, great presentation and taste and, of course, providing dishes the kids want to eat.'
