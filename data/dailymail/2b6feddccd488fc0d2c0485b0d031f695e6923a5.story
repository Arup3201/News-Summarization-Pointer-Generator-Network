Labour will struggle to win a majority in the general election because UKIP’s  success has ended the  traditional two-party system, one of its senior MPs warned yesterday.

Former Cabinet minister Peter Hain also admitted that many voters ‘don’t see’ Ed Miliband as a prime minister.

His comments came as shadow ministers warned traditional working-class Labour voters were abandoning the party for UKIP, which resonated with them more.

Peter Hain, the former Cabinet minister, has announced that he is standing down at the next General Election but also although Ed Miliband will be PM, UKIP will prevent a Labour majority

Mr Hain, who is standing down at next year’s election, said that it was likely that Mr Miliband would be in No 10 after the election, but did not know if the party could win a majority.

The Neath MP said  voters would realise Mr Miliband was the right person to lead the country once he was in Downing Street – ‘even if they don’t see that at the moment’.

He added: ‘Whether we’ll have a majority, which I will fight for along with every other Labour Party member, I don’t know because it’s very, very hard to win a majority now in British politics because we’re not in a two-party system, which we had for generations. We’re in a multi-party system.

‘Ed 
Miliband is well placed to lead the government in the future and I think
 people, when they see him as prime minister, will actually realise that
 they’ve elected the right person, even if maybe they don’t see that at 
the moment.’ 

after
 Labour’s recent run of poor election results, work and pensions 
spokesman Rachel Reeves warned that senior Labour figures that 
blue-collar supporters felt UKIP understood their fears better. 

She said campaigning had shown her that support for the party was falling in safe seats.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (left) believes that Labour should not seek to mimic UKIP to steal their votes while Rachel Reeves (right), work and pensions spokesman, says that the working class  think Labour no longer represents theme

‘Traditional voters, who perhaps at times we took for granted but had nowhere else to go, are now being offered an alternative by UKIP,' she added.

‘Our voters – if I can still call them that – see UKIP offering a vision and a hope that things can be better. They hear something that resonates with them and with their fears for the future and that’s something very real that we have to contend with.

‘The Labour Party came into existence to give a voice for ordinary working people.

‘I saw middle-class, public-sector, well-educated young graduates voting Labour – but the people who the Labour Party was set up to help abandoning us.

‘Our very raison d’etre will be threatened if the working people who the Labour Party have got to be a voice for start to drift  away because they don’t see us as the answer.’ 

But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper warned that the party should not seek to mimic UKIP to steal their votes.

She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We can’t imitate UKIP, we have got to take them on.’
