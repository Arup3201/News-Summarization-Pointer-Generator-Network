Former GOP presidential hopeful Rick Santorum said today that President Obama is a ‘sore winner’ and is taking out his anger on Republicans.

Speaking Sunday on ABC’s ‘The Week,’ the former Pennsylvania senator said that members of Mr Obama’s administration are ‘not very gracious winners.’

Elaborating, Mr Santorum said that while the newly-inaugurated president has the power to get things done in Washington during his second term by shifting his office, he often ‘(forces) Republicans always to come his way.’

Mr Santorum, who suspended his presidential campaign in April 2012 following the hospitalization of his daughter Bella, told George Stephanopoulos that the Democrats are ‘not very gracious winners.’

He added: ‘(Obama) could get something done on deficits and entitlements, but he’s got to move his people to do that, instead of forcing Republicans always to come his way.

‘And that’s the problem.’

The chairman of Patriot Voices added that Mr Obama has real power to make a difference with immigration reform. 

But, he said on the ABC News program, ‘there’s not a single Republican up on Capitol Hill who believes he wants to get it done,’ adding that members of the GOP believe Mr Obama will instead propose a measure that doesn’t sit well with Republicans, who then would not pass it.

Mr Santorum also said during the Powerhouse Roundtable that he rejects Mr Obama’s gun laws.

Asked what he believed the Republican party should to, the former senator responded: ‘I think we should stick to our guns.’

‘Gun ownership is part of how people can feel safer,’ he explained.

Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, strongly disagreed. ‘This is not about taking people’s guns away,’ she began.

‘It’s about a narrow set of proposals that will enable us to enforce the existing gun laws, the ban on assault weapons, and a ban on high-capacity magazines.’

She said that the majority of citizens prefer a ban on assault weapons as well.
