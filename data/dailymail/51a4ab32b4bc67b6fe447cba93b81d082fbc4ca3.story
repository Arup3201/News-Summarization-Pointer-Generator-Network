Spending cuts will have to last at least four more years, George Osborne suggested last night.

The Chancellor said this was a price worth paying to ensure economic stability and create private sector jobs. 

With coalition divisions on the economy widening, he suggested the squeeze on the public sector would last until 2019.

Spending cuts will have to last at least four more years, George Osborne suggested last night

‘We are going to have to make savings – we are going to have to cut certain welfare bills like benefits that go to working-age people,’ he told the BBC.

‘But the prize is economic stability, growth, jobs in the future, brighter future, I think that’s a price that works for our country.’

Mr Osborne’s remarks came after days of what appeared to be a carefully choreographed coalition row over future plans on cutting the deficit.

His Liberal Democrat deputy, Danny Alexander, suggested yesterday that the Conservatives were in a ‘pre-election panic’. He claimed the Chancellor and his colleagues wanted to inflict unnecessary pain because they were ‘economically committed to shrinking the state ever further’.

Mr Osborne also came under fire from Labour. Stefan Stern, a writer for Labour List, an unofficial party supporters’ website, and a visiting professor at Cass Business School, said Mr Osborne’s remarks were ‘truly Lamontable’.

This was a reference to Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont’s suggestion in 1991 that rising unemployment and the recession were a ‘price worth paying’ to get inflation down.

Prime Minister David Cameron claimed the Lib Dems were 'all over the place' while Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander accused the Tories of wanting to 'inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain'

‘The Liberal Democrats are all over the place, unable to decide whether they want to stick to the plan or veer off it.’

‘We are going to have to make savings... but the prize is economic stability, growth, jobs in the future, brighter future, I think that’s a price that works for our country.’

George Osborne

‘I just think the Conservatives are kidding themselves and seeking to kid voters if they are claiming that it is possible to balance the books, deliver unfunded tax cuts, shrink the state and support public services.’

Nick Clegg

‘It is sad to see the Conservatives move away from the sensible, balanced approach of the coalition, to a policy that would inflict unnecessary pain on the people of Britain.’

Danny Alexander

While there are real differences between the coalition parties on the correct balance between tax rises and spending cuts, senior Government figures believe the latest round of sniping is planned.

The Lib Dems and the Tories appear to have agreed to air their disagreements in public in the five months before the general election, even while exploring the viability of another pact.

As well as energising their core supporters, the strategy crowds Labour out of the main political argument.

Mr Osborne said: ‘There is a real choice for people between the competence offered by the Conservatives and the chaos of the other parties. What they are offering is a chaotic alternative of higher taxes, higher borrowing and a return to economic chaos. Britain doesn’t want to come back to square one.

‘We are offering a competent government with a clear plan that involves difficult decisions on spending and on welfare, and making the rich pay more through their tax avoidance schemes being closed down. And that is delivering economic security.

‘The alternative is economic chaos and people who are simply not being straight with the public about what their plan involves.’

The Chancellor gave his strongest hint yet that a pay squeeze in the public sector will have to go on for another four years, to limit the number of job losses.

‘What I would say is we can reduce the number that need to go if we take difficult decisions on public sector pay,’ he said.

‘This country has to live within its means. We have to have a government we can afford.’

Mr Alexander insisted there were big differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats. He said: ‘What we are doing is something that should be totally unsurprising, which is two political parties – with very different ideologies – setting out their views about the future of this country in a clear and distinct way.’ A Labour spokesman said Mr Osborne had broken his promises on the economy and failed to deliver rising living standards.

A small number of Conservative MPs, including Right-wing backbencher Peter Bone, have suggested Mr Cameron should break up the coalition and govern alone as leader of a minority administration. A larger group would opt for the coalition to end if the Tories were able to call an immediate general election.

Conservative MP Nadine Dorries told London Live: ‘It’s almost certain that there will be a coalition government next time. A coalition of who, is the question.’

She said the likeliest result was a Conservative majority not big enough to govern alone.
