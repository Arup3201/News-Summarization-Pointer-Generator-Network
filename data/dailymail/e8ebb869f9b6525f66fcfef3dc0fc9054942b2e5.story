Staff at a San Francisco restaurant got a pleasant New Year's surprise when a customer left a $2,000 tip in the latest in a series of 'Tips for Jesus'.

A diner at Tacolicious left the gratuity after paying a bill of just $50.74 on January 2.

A photograph of the receipt was then posted to the 'Tips for Jesus' Instagram account.

Happy New Year: The substantial tip left at San Francisco restaurant Tacolicious on January 2

Staff at the Tacolicious restaurant on Valencia Street would each get a share of the generous tip

The generous gesture follows one in Arizona on December 27, where a $11,000 tip was left on a bill of just $420, with a note saying 'Tips for Jesus'.

A staff member at Tacolicious told Sfgate the tipper 'comes in here all the time and he's amazing. Amazing to the staff'.

The restaurant worker said the gratuity would be shared among the staff.

Many suspect the person behind the Tips for Jesus phenomenon is the former Vice-President of PayPal, Jack Selby.

It has previously been reported that the Tips for Jesus tippers are a collective of wealthy people. 

'Tips for Jesus' is believed to refer to the anonymous person - or people - who regularly leave extravagant tips at restaurants and document their recipients' joy on an Instagram page.

The page, which has more than 84,000 followers, features the slogan: 'Doing the Lord's work, one tip at a time.' It typically features restaurants in New York and Los Angeles, as well as Phoenix.

In the Arizona incident, an unidentified man initially left a $1,000 tip on a $331.40 bill for drinks and snacks he had shared with a woman at Crudo restaurant.  

A welcome surprise: A mystery customer has lifted the spirits of three Arizona-based restaurant workers after leaving around $11,000 worth of 'Tips for Jesus' two days after Christmas. Above, the tipper's receipts

Amazed: Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three servers who received the tips at Crudo restaurant in Phoenix, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, saying: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!! Unbelievable!'

Bartender: The unidentified customer arrived at the restaurant in Phoenix at 10pm on December 27 and shared a post-dinner snack and a round of drinks with a woman, it is said. Above, Mr Spotleson

Venue: He then closed the tab at the restaurant (pictured), leaving a $1,000 tip on a $331.40 bill, before they both stayed for further drinks. When they later paid off the second $89.89 tab, the man added a $10,000 tip

The pair then stayed on further and when the man closed the second tab for $89.99, he left another tip of $10,000. 

Bartender Clint Spotleson, one of the three Crudo servers who received the tips, posted a photo of the bills to Instagram, writing: '@tipsforjesus hit @crudoaz again!!!!! Unbelievable!!!'

On both of the receipts, the words, 'Tips for Jesus', were scrawled in pen by the customer. 

Speaking to AOL, Mr Spotleson said he, another bartender and a cocktail waitress shared the $11,000 combined tip, but also chose to give some of it to Crudo's kitchen staff.

Describing his reaction to the customer's estimated 2,500-per-cent tip, he added: 'I dropped everything I had and just froze for second.... I had a bottle in my hand when he said it.

'It was a quick slip, but I caught it. The owner kind of gave me this look like, "Oh, my gosh, wow!".'

Maureen Campbell, one of Crudo's partners, told ABC News that although the tipper wished to remain anonymous, he did stick around long enough to allow the restaurant workers to thank him.

'That's amazing!': Members of the public responded positively to the anonymous customer's generous tip

'He did hand them the check before he left and they were very grateful for such a generous amount of money they received,' she said. 'I don’t know what his response was.'

She added that the woman who had accompanied the man was believed by staff to be his date.

The customer, who was using an American Express card, apparently left a tip at the same restaurant last year. However, it was for a lower - still, generous - amount of $2,500.

Describing the tipper, Mr Spotleson said: 'He's a man ... He's in an age group where he's not old and rackety, but he's definitely got the ability to spend that kind of money.'
