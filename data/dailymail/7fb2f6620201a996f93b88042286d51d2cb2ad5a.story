With stunning looks and an immersive story, it’s no surprise The Witcher games have sold millions.

And thankfully The Witcher 3 is on the way, but it will be Geralt’s final outing.

Wild Hunt will be powered by CD Projekt RED’s REDENGINE 3 and will be 30 times larger than the previous game, Assassins of Kings, with the promise of post launch expansion packs.

One last hurrah: This will be Geralt's final outing

Unlike the last game, which was broken up
into acts, REDENGINE 3 allows the uninterrupted exploration of a vast
open world. There will also be dynamic weather systems and advanced 
water physics.

Fast travel will feature and main 
character, Geralt, can also ride horses. Gameplay has been improved, too, 
with reports that the clumsy Quick Time events that plagued its predecessor  have been dropped.

Adam 
Badowski, head of CD Projekt RED, said: ‘The captivating and non-linear 
story of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt takes place in a rich, truly 
open-world environment.

'A world which is thrilling to explore, full of 
daring adventures, momentous quests, memorable characters, and unique 
monsters.

'Imagine playing a dark fantasy game with 
the same great non-linear story as in the previous Witcher titles, but 
now told in a world you can explore freely with no artificial 
boundaries. 

'The war-ravaged world is so huge that to 
reach farther places you will need to ride a horse or sail a boat to get
there. A world where your choices have truly epic consequences. From 
the development side, this goal is extremely demanding.

‘Our team had to make significant design changes and our tech had to be rebuilt. But we believe that this will lead to a completely new level of non-linearity and a whole new, richer gaming experience.

‘As a gamer, I would love to play this kind of RPG, and I think this is what many players are waiting for. This is our dream come true at CD Projekt RED, and we hope it will be the same for you.’
