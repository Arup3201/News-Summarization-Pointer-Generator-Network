If England's early World Cup exit was not hard enough to stomach then look away now because the Australian media has found rich entertainment in poking fun at Eoin Morgan's beleaguered men.

After the calamitous 5-0 Ashes whitewash last winter, Australian scribes could hardly have expected that just 12 months later they would be handed even more ammunition to shoot down the mother country.

The 15-run defeat to Bangladesh that sealed England's fate in Adelaide was their fourth defeat in five games at a forgettable World Cup and means they will fly home after their now meaningless final group game against Afghanistan on Friday.

The Australian newspapers pulled no punches as they mercilessly mocked England's exit

'Cheerio chaps: Poms are bangers and mashed' was the back-page headline that greeted the England squad when they landed in Sydney on Tuesday.

If coach Peter Moores and his team dared pick up a copy of the Daily Telegraph they were certainly reminded, in no uncertain terms, how well an English failure is regarded in the Antipodes.

'England have been utterly embarrassing,' the story opined before throwing thoughts ahead to this summer's Ashes, adding: 'Australian fans now can't wait to face cricket's minnows - that's England - in the Ashes.'

Back at the scene of England's exit the Adelaide Advertiser focused on the prospect of Moores being replaced by Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie, who grew up in the South Australian capital.

'The look on ashen-faced Moores as cameras panned in encapsulated a dead man sitting,' Richard Earle wrote.

'England's demise will now have Yorkshire and incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves sending an SOS to 71-Test paceman Gillespie.'

England's 'catalogue of Adelaide disasters' was also broken down since the unlikely last-day Test defeat in 2006 when it was suggested then captain Andrew Flintoff had been 'turned to drink to soothe the pain'.

England's poor record at World Cups was also underlined in the brevity of one statistic which read: 'While the British Empire has faded so has its cricket machine, winning just five matches against top-eight ranked rivals in World Cups since 1996.'

Moores' own apparent liking for statistic was not missed, and his post-match claim that he would need to 'look at the data' raised a Aussie smirk or two with one internet headline reading: 'Analyse this data; One win, four losses' before offering a link to 'England's worst cricket disasters'.

The anguish is clear to see on Taylor's face as he is dismissed, and England exited at the first stage

In The Australian one of the country's pre-eminent cricket writer's Gideon Haigh was more nuance, but no less scathing, as he wrote of the fear that was visible on the England players' faces whenever the television cameras panned to them waiting in the dugout to bat.

'They were as cheerful as boys awaiting the cuts from their headmaster. At the centre of it all, Peter Moores, grey hair seeming to whiten at each wicket.

'And at the last, a tiny glimpse of Joe Root, seated next to his coach as James Anderson fell, blowing a little bubble of gum. Pop - that was all it took.'

Haigh finished by adding: 'Moores wanted people to wait to judge him until after the World Cup ended. They're ready, coach.'
