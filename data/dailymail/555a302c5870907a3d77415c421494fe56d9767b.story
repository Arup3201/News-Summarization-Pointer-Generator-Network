Eastern Ukraine has suffered the worst violence in more than a week as fighting between pro-Russian rebels and government troops in the region killed at least 12 people and wounded 32.

Colonel Andriy Lysenko told journalists in a briefing in Kiev this morning that at least nine troops were killed and 27 had been wounded during clashes in Donetsk, Kharkiv, and Luhansk yesterday.

Meanwhile, the city council of Donetsk said in a statement published online that at least three civilians were killed and five wounded in overnight shelling of a residential area in the northern part of the city, where fighting has centered on the government-held airport.

Respect: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko attends a wreath laying ceremony this morning. The event was held for the victims of the Nazi massacre in Babiy Yar, Kiev during the Second World War

Violence has continued despite a cease-fire declared on September. 5. Since fighting began in April, the conflict has claimed at least 3,500 lives.

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has been at pains to insist to a skeptical audience at home that his peace plan is working.

On September. 20, representatives of Russia, Ukraine, and the rebels signed another agreement that would require both sides to remove all heavy artillery from the frontline, creating a buffer zone that would allow the cease-fire to be better enforced.

On Sunday, in the second-largest Ukrainian city, Kharkiv, nationalists tore down an enormous statue of Vladimir Lenin to cheers from the crowd. 

Across Ukraine, people have torn down statues to the former Communist leader in a symbolic display of anti-Russian sentiment.

Russia and the European Union will continue talks on gas supplies to Ukraine on Thursday or Friday in Berlin, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said today.

He said he had no information about whether Exxonmobil had stopped its operations in Russia. 

Earlier, a Russian influential business daily reported that the U.S. oil major had halted its operations in Russia to comply with Western sanctions against Moscow.

The news comes as it was revealed that  Russian President Vladimir Putin will attend a summit of European and Asian leaders in Italy next month.

The summit, which takes place every two years, is being held in Milan on October. 16-17. 

It would be the first opportunity for Putin to meet with top European leaders since D-Day celebrations in Normandy, France back in June.

Since then Putin's relationship with the West has deteriated to unprecedented levels over claims he is not doing enough to stop violence by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine. 

The authorities in Kharkiv supported the move. Arsen Avakov, Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs and a Kharkiv native, wrote on his Facebook page: 'Lenin? Let him fall... As long as nobody gets hurt.'

The news comes as France and Germany offered to deploy drones as part of efforts by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation to beef up monitoring of the ceasefire in Ukraine.

OSCE spokesman Shiv Sharma said earlier in September the group would initially deploy two drones at the end of the month or the beginning of October, and that more would follow later.

'As requested by the OSCE in Europe, France and Germany have proposed to provide drones aimed at monitoring the ceasefire's implementation,' French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said in a daily news briefing.

Despite the September 5 ceasefire, fighting has flared frequently around Donetsk international airport, in eastern Ukraine, which is held by government forces.

Seven Ukrainian soldiers were killed when a separatist shell hit their armoured personnel carrier near the airport, a military spokesman said on Monday.

Nadal said the drone offer was being studied by the OSCE. He gave no further details.

The drones are part of plans to expand the OSCE's mission in Ukraine, where five months of fighting have led to Russia's biggest clash with the West since the end of the Cold War

A gigantic statue of Lenin has been torn down by Ukrainian nationalists who cheered and chanted as they cut off the Communist monument's metal nose. 

Flares and anti-Russian slogans erupted from a crowd of thousands last night as the statue came crashing to the ground in Kharkiv's Freedom Square.

The protesters, many of them masked, carved the words 'Glory to Ukraine' on the plinth of the monument, which was destroyed with the permission of the regional government.

Goodbye Lenin: One of the largest remaining statues of the Communist leader was torn down last night by Ukrainian nationalists in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which is just 25 miles from the border with Russia

Destroyed: As the 50-year-old monument came crashing to the ground there were cheers and a flare was let off. Ukraine's interior minister Arsen Avakov called it a 'bloody Communist idol' and celebrated its destruction

Even Ukraine's interior minister joined celebrations at the vanquishing of what he called the 'bloody Communist idol'.

At around 28ft tall, it was said to be the largest Lenin statue in Ukraine and had stood in Kharkiv's central square since 1964.

It came crashing down in a cloud of dust last night after protesters spent several hours taking heavy cutting equipment to the base of the metal monument.

With hundreds of voices chanting slogans and the blue and yellow Ukrainian flag draped from the plinth, they took hammers to the statue's face and removed its nose before carrying it through the crowd.

Kharkiv is just 25 miles from Ukraine's border with Russia, and like the neighbouring cities of Luhansk and Donetsk it was overrun by gangs of pro-Russian separatists in April.

Unlike its neighbours, however, Kharkiv crushed the main uprising just two days later when Ukrainian forces stormed a security services building which the pro-Russians had seized.

Around 70 separatists, some of whom were also accused of storming a TV station, were arrested.
