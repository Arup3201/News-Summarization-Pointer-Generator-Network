A family has been torn apart after a woman agreed to have a baby for her own mother and then backed out of the surrogacy arrangement while pregnant.

Leanne Stanford originally made the extraordinary offer after her mother Judith Roberts miscarried the IVF baby she was expecting with her new husband at 21 weeks.

It was while leaving hospital that Miss Stanford told her mother: ‘If you want to try again I’ll help you. I’ll be a surrogate for you if you want me to.’

She became pregnant at the first attempt using sperm from her stepfather Mark Roberts – and gave her 50-year-old mother the news in a gift box with a card.

Mrs Roberts was thrilled but her delight turned to dismay after the 26-year-old had second thoughts following a scan at mid-pregnancy.

Miss Stanford, a single mother who has a four-year-old son from a previous relationship, consulted a solicitor and as the surrogacy agreement was never legally formalised she was free to back out and did so by sending a letter to her mother.

She said: ‘What it came down to was that the bond with my baby was stronger than the bond with my mum.’

The baby, Mollie, was born in November 2012 weighing a healthy 8lb 11oz.

Initially mother-of-four Mrs Roberts and her husband, 50, visited the baby they hoped would be with them.

Mrs Roberts said she was desperate for a sibling for her seven-year-old daughter – the youngest of her four girls.

But emotions became so strong that the relationship between mother and daughter broke down completely.

Mrs Roberts is alleged to have texted a mutual friend: ‘Tell her she is dead to me.’

Mollie is now 18 months old and the saga has taken another twist with Miss Stanford pursuing care worker Mr Roberts for maintenance through the Child Support Agency.

Miss Stanford said: ‘I have my daughter’s best interests at heart and I have to make sure she is being properly looked after.’

Yesterday Mrs Roberts, a cleaner, refused to speak in detail, but said: ‘She doesn’t want anything to do with us. She doesn’t let us see the children.’

Mrs Roberts had no direct genetic connection to the baby as her egg was not used in a DIY process carried out at home.

Miss Stanford, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, appears to have infuriated her mother even further by going public and selling her story to a newspaper. She told The Mirror: ‘This has caused a split between myself and my mum that can never be healed.

‘But every time I look at my beautiful little girl and feel that surge of love for her I know I made the right decision.’

She said of the offer she made to her mother: ‘It was a spur of the moment offer made at a time of high emotion. But I meant it, I really wanted to help them.’

However, in time she began to bond with the unborn child and concluded that she ‘ just couldn’t hand over my baby to mum’.
