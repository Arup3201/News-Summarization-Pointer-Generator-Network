September marks 15 years since graduates Larry Page and Sergey Brin set up a small web crawler from a garage in Silicon Valley, which went onto become the world's biggest search engine.

The site was originally called BackRub, but was changed in 1997 to Google - a misspelling of the word googol which is a term for the number one followed by one hundred zeros.

There is a little confusion around when Google's official birthday is, but reports claim papers to incorporate the company were filed on September 4 1998. The company became incorporated three days later and the domain was registered on September 15.

Google has teamed up with 
Nestle to launch the next version of its Android operating system, called Android 4.4 KitKat.

It follows the release of other sweet-themed software names including such 
as Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Android Jelly Bean.

There had been speculation that the latest version would be named Android Key Lime Pie because each release begins with the letter of the alphabet that follows the previous.

To mark the announcement, the KitKat homepage has been redesigned as a parody of Google software releases.

The release of Android KitKat will be marked with a competition to win 
prizes including 1,000 Google Nexus 7 tablets through more than 50 
million specially-branded KitKat bars.

Consumers can take part by buying special packs of KitKat four-finger 
and KitKat Chunky multipacks available in Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda 
and Tesco. 

Google, however, now officially celebrates the event with a Google Doodle on September 27.

It is thought this date was changed as an attempt to gain media coverage several years ago, at a time when Yahoo was gaining ground on Google.

The site is now the world's number one search engine and its name has become so synonymous with searching, it is now used as a verb in its 
own right.

Despite its humble beginnings in a rented garage that belonged to Susan Wojcicki - Brin's now sister-in-law - the company now has more than 70 offices in more than 40 global locations, including London, with their headquarters - known as the Googleplex - in Mountain View, California.

Its size and reputation grew rapidly in the first few years, with three billion web documents on Google's index by December 2001.

Innovations subsequently launched by Google that have become part of everyday life include Google Maps, Google Streetview and Google Earth, each showing how far the company now spans across the globe.

Its Android operating system is also the most popular mobile software in the world and it has teamed up with manufacturers including Asus and LG to launch a number of best-selling devices such as the Nexus 4 smartphone and Nexus 7 tablet.

Google also bought Motorola in 2011 and a new Moto X handset is expected towards the end of this year.

Looking to the future, Google Glass is one of the internet giant's latest products, aiming to offer voice-activated hands-free connectivity through a wearable device.

Plus, Google has designed a range of self-driving cars that use sensors and mapping technology to travel around cities without a driver.

Industry experts have praised Google for its success, however, some have questioned how long it can stay at the top.

Joseph Lampel, professor of strategy at Cass Business School, City University London, said Google had to continue to innovate to make sure they stay ahead of the curve to survive the next 15 years.

Professor Lampel said: 'I am not surprised they have survived this far but if you're asking if they will survive until they are 25 or 30, that's another question.'

Google's Android operating system is now the most popular mobile software in the world. A screenshot of an early version, called Android 2.2 Froyo is pictured left. The most recent release, Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, is shown in the right-hand image

He said there was increasing competition from search engines from emerging markets, especially those in Asia, and added: 'Google might not be able to maintain their level of dominance, if the industry opens up to competitors.

'The question also arises of the very function of Google. The search engine business will shift in the next decade into new technology and new devices.'

Professor Lampel attributed Google's success to its speed in adding services to their search engine and their push into hardware with products like Google Glass.

'All in all, they have done very well, and they have had an enormous influence, without question,' he said.

Colin Cieszynski, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'It's really incredible when you think about whatGoogle has done over this period of time.

'They've taken a lead in the second wave of success of the internet, becoming the premier company. It's like there was a shake-up, and they're the ones who ended up on top.

'Yahoo has struggled along, but lots of others have fallen by the wayside. They have continued to innovate. The question is, how long do you manage to stay on top of everyone else?

'But this anniversary is incredible for them - they're still on top. To dominate for so long is amazing.'

Despite the milestone date being reached, Google may not be marking the event until later in the month - having put out last year's Google Doodle to celebrate their 14th anniversary on September 27.

A Google spokeswoman would not be drawn on whether users could expect any birthday surprises during September.

Last year, a Google Doodle showed a birthday cake with 14 candles, which had slices removed until the name of the search engine emerged.  

Google traditionally marks its birthday with a Google Doodle such as this one that was unveiled to celebrate its 10th anniversary. Up to 2005, the birthday Doodle was unveiled on September 7 but since that date Google now releases it on September 27

Google Doodles can also be used to mark major milestones in history, as well as birthdays. This Doodle from August 28 this year marked the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous speech

The first Google Doodle, which is when the Google logo is altered on the site's homepage in celebration of a particular event, was in 1998 to mark the Burning Man festival.

In May 2012, Google unveiled its first interactive Google Doodle to celerate the 30th anniversary of the arcade game Pac-Man, in association with Namco.

Searchers play Pac-Man within their browser by clicking the 'Insert Coin' button.

When players pressed this button a second time, a second player would join the game as Ms. Pac-Man.

The game was so popular, Google made it a permanent site after the Doodle had been removed.

Later the same year, Google unveiled its first animated Google Doodle to mark John Lennon's 70th birthday with a short clip of his song 'Imagine'.

A similar Doodle was launched, using a clip of Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' song, to mark Freddie Mercury's 65th birthday in September 2011.

The image, tweeted by Idealabs found Bill Gross shows what Google's self-driving car sees as it turns left. Gross claims the cars collect 1GB of data every second. Google has become a pioneer in forward-looking technology over its 15-year history
