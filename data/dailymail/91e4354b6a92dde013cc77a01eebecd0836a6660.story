A Florida woman has been charged with murder after she allegedly stabbed-to-death her 7-year-old grandson because she was 'fed up' with babysitting.

Martha White, 63, was charged with first-degree murder Wednesday.

According to The Tallahassee Democrat,
 White interrupted her grandson Mason Rhinehart and his 8-year-old 
brother as they played video games Tuesday morning, and told them she 
had a surprise for them.

She then allegedly took Mason into the Killearn Lakes Plantation home's bathroom and locked the door.

Charged: Mason Rhinehart, 7, and his 8-year-old brother were playing video games in their Killearn Lakes Plantation home Tuesday morning when their grandmother, Martha White, pictured, allegedly murdered the younger child

Tragic: White allegedly stabbed to death Mason Rhinehart, pictured, Tuesday morning

Mason's brother told police he heard him start to cry inside the locked bathroom and beg his grandmother for mercy.

'I don't want to die, please don't kill me,' the boy allegedly said.

His brother said he tried to get in the bathroom to help his younger sibling but couldn't so he called his father and hid.

He told police he saw White leave the 
home with a bottle of wine but not before telling him she 'had a 
surprise for him too,' court documents said.
