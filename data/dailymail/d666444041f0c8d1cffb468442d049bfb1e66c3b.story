Chelsea Clinton was beaming on the red carpet Thursday night, just hours after sharing with the world the happy news that she and Marc Mezvinsky are expecting their first child.

The former first daughter attended the Shorts Program: City Limits at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival screenings at AMC Loews Village 7 in New York. She is executive producer for the film 'Of Many.'

The 34-year-old revealed she was pregnant Thursday afternoon at the Clinton Foundation's No Ceilings: The Full Participation Project, which aims to empower young women.

She told the assembled guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.'

There was a cheer from the audience as she revealed the news, before she continued: 'I certainly feel all the better 
whether it’s a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled
 with so many strong, young female leaders. . .

'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.'

Chelsea
 is likely to be around 12 weeks along; most women wait until the start 
of the second trimester to announce their pregnancy because the chance 
of miscarriage is greatly reduced.

Hillary
 Clinton followed the announcement with an excited Twitter post. She 
wrote: 'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be! @billclinton and I
 are thrilled that Chelsea and Marc are expecting their first child!'

Husband Bill echoed her words with a tweet of
 his own, reading: 'Excited to add a new line to my Twitter 
bio...grandfather-to-be! @hillaryclinton and I are so happy for Chelsea 
and Marc!'

Hillary
 was present on stage as Chelsea revealed her news, as well as Ugly 
Betty actress America Ferrera who was moderating the event.

She said to the attendees that a new generation 'makes this work even more important.'

Already the congratulations are flooding in for Chelsea and her husband.

Jenna Bush Hager, a fellow former first daughter and new mother herself, tweeted: 'Congratulations @ChelseaClinton! Welcome to the best club in the world. Mamahood is wonderful. Xx'

And the Washington Post's Philip Rucker revealed that Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is delighted for the family too.

He tweeted: 'I asked Anna Wintour about Chelsea Clinton baby news: "I'm so thrilled. I know that Sec Clinton has wanted a grandchild for a long time."'

Chelsea acknowledged the congratulations in kind, tweeting: 'Marc and I are so thrilled to be expecting our first child in the fall! Thank you for all of the kind words!'

Chelsea has faced much pressure from her parents to start a family over the past few years - and in an interview with Glamour magazine last year, she hinted that she and Marc were trying for a child.

'2014 is the year of the baby,' she said. 'Call my mother and tell her that. She asks [Marc and I] about it every single day.'

Indeed, Hillary has made no secret of her desire to be a grandmother.

Speaking
 in the March 2011 issue of Harper's Bazaar, she admitted that 
she'd probably be an 'unbearable' grandmother, but she'd 'love' Chelsea to have children.

She
 said of the suggestion: 'Well, no pressure, because I don't want to be 
one of those kinds of mothers. But obviously, someday, I'd love it.'

Chelsea later reassured her mother 
during a 2012 interview with Vogue, that she was gearing up to start a 
family 'in a couple of years'.

The
 couple, both Stanford University graduates, met when they were 
teenagers, but didn't start dating until years later in 2005. They tied 
the knot during a lavish ceremony five years later.

While Marc works as an investment banker in New York, Chelsea, after dabbling in Wall Street, is now fully committed to helping shape her family foundation - and has even put her name on the door.

She has traveled extensively on behalf of  the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation - previously known as the William J. Clinton Foundation - and serves as Vice Chair.

She presided over a panel on noncommunicable diseases and announced several philanthropic commitments at the Clinton Global Initiative recently, including efforts to provide clean drinking water and promote the health of women and children in Latin America.

The youngest Clinton has also hinted that politics could be in her future.

In an interview with CNN from Rwanda last year, she said she was 'attempting to lead a purposely public life' and that she might consider politics if she thought she could make a difference.

Impressive: Their new marital home lays claim to being one of New York's longest apartment - stretching an entire block from 26th Street to 27th Street off Madison Avenue

Work aside, she told Glamour that her main ambitions in life are to be 'a good wife, daughter, and friend' and she doesn't 'fundamentally care about making money.'

However, a hefty bank balance came in useful as she and Marc splashed out on a $10.5million, four-bedroom apartment earlier this year.
