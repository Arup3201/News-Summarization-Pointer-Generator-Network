A former New York City Ballet soloist, who had to quit her promising career as a dancer after a thyroid illness caused her to gain 40lbs, has broken her silence.

Kathryn Morgan, now 25 and based in New York, was only 17 when she joined the prestigious NYCB and was 21 when she was diagnosed with an under-active thyroid. At 23 when she quit in order to recover.

'You have to be thin, you have to look good, you have to fit in the costume, and that’s pretty much it,' she told The Huffington Post. 'It's just part of the job.'

Miss Morgan, who has danced lead roles including Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, and Aurora in Sleeping Beauty, battled with her illness for two years before accepting it was time to leave the NYCB.

Dancing ten hours a day and juggling the industry standard of 50 ballet shows per season became impossible amid the crippling migraines, exhaustion, hair loss and weight gain.

'I remember [my ballet masters] just constantly telling me, "You're gaining weight; you're gaining weight; you're gaining weight." And I just thought, "Yes, I know",' she recalls, referring to the time just before her diagnoses, when the weight gain was unexplained.

Miss Morgan is keen to maintain that it were her choice to break her contract and head to her hometown of Mobile, Alabama, to recover; and that the NYCB's concerns over her weight were purely logistical.

She describes ballet as an 'aesthetic art' with a certain standard that audience members pay to enjoy. That, and the simple fact that the male dancers 'need to be able to lift you,' renders your weight important.

'When I was heavier, I found that things just hurt more,' she admits. 'Pointe shoes hurt a lot more, and it was really hard to do some of the things that I did when I was thinner at a heavier weight.'

Her difficult decision to leave her fledgling career was probably wise. Miss Morgan spent the next two years recovering in Alabama, where she started a blog, If The Pointe Shoe Fits, and a YouTube channel for other aspiring dancers.

Giving guidance and advice to others was, and still is, a therapeutic practice for Miss Morgan, who describes it as 'catering to my 13-year-old self.'

Questions she receives from young, ambitious girls regarding the importance of weight and general appearance are tough, but Miss Morgan claims she never lies.

It wouldn't be helpful, she points out, to paint an unattainable fantasy, because it is an industry, much like modelling, where weight will always be a concern.

'You're looking at yourself in the mirror every single day in a leotard,' she remarks. 'I tell people who are not dancers that it's like being in a bathing suit all day long.'

Miss Morgan notes that during her time at the highly competitive NYCB, she wasn't exposed directly to eating disorders. 

In all likelihood however, many girls were 'probably very good at hiding it.'

She does argue that the intense physical demands of the job are enough to keep dancers slender in of itself, and that it would be impossible to 'not eat' and still manage to perform at such a level.

Miss Morgan (pictured in May) is now recovered, has dropped 25lbs, and plans to return to ballet

Miss Morgan, who stills runs her popular blog and YouTube channel, was given a clean bill of health in May of this year, and is keen to pick up where she left off.

The first step, she says, it to 'get in shape' again - she's dropped 25lbs so far - and then she will start auditioning for ballet companies.

She was unable to rejoin the NYCB, so will have to explore other options.

In a statement made to The New York Times last month, Peter Martins, the company’s ballet master in chief, said: 

'[Miss Morgan's] decision to leave New York City Ballet was an enormous loss, but was, of course, necessary so that she could focus on her health.

'When Katie reached out to me in the spring of 2013 about possibly returning to the stage, I was thrilled to hear that she was feeling better.

'However, at the time NYCB was working very hard to eliminate several years of budget deficits, and I was simply unable to add another dancer to the roster, and could not offer Katie a position with the company.'

Despite this set-back, taking a break from the occupation that had dominated her life - 'If you're more concerned with having friends, this may not be the career for you,' she advises in one video - has actually been a positive learning experience for Miss Morgan.

With her health back, a legion of over 9,000 subscribers to her YouTube channel, and dreams of ending up at a ballet company in Europe, Miss Morgan's future looks to be bright again.
