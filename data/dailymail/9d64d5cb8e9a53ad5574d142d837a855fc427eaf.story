Corporate manslaugher; Alan Catterall, 54, was burned to death at work when the door slammed shut on the industrial oven he was cleaning

A factory supervisor's widow has hailed a 'landmark' verdict of corporate manslaughter after her husband was burned to death inside an industrial oven at work.

Relatives of Alan Catterall, 54, wept as plastic kayak manufacturer Pyranha Mouldings became one of the first companies in the country to be convicted of the charge following a five week trial.

Mr Catterall's widow, Pearl, said: 'I am definitely happy with the verdict and hopefully it is a landmark for other cases like this.'

'But it does not change the fact that Alan is no longer with us and his family miss him desperately. He has missed his son’s wedding and birth of his grandson and will not see his two daughters marry.

'Alan was a hard-working, conscientious man and he gave Pyranha Mouldings everything. It hurts that they have not admitted any failings in their health and safety procedures.'

Mr Catterall died after he was trapped inside the industrial oven at the company's factory in Premier Point, Runcorn, Cheshire, on December 23, 2010.

The father-of-three from Halewood, Liverpool, had gone inside to clean molten plastic escaping from a mould while the oven was switched off after a fault developed.

But when the fault was repaired his colleague Mark Francis turned the power, causing the doors to slam shut and lock from the outside. In a cruel twist, Mr Francis was engaged to Mr Catterall's eldest daughter.

During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court Andrew Thomas, QC, prosecuting, said no-one realised Mr Catterall was trapped inside the oven until smoke started seeping out and the 'horrific' circumstances of his death discovered.

'The design of the oven was such that the moment it was switched on the doors automatically shut and coked with metal pins which dropped into place on the outside,' Mr Thomas said. 'Mr Catterall was trapped within the oven. There was no means of escape and no means of raising the alarm.'

As the temperature soared, Mr Catterall desperately tried to prise open the oven door with a crowbar but could not do so. His shouts for help were drowned out by the din of the noisy factory. The court heard he died after suffering severe burns and shock.

Pyranha Mouldings was found guilty by a majority verdict of 10-2 and unanimously convicted of two health and safety breaches. Technical director Peter Mackereth, 60, of Iso Vivoid, Llangollen, North Wales, was unanimously found guilty of two health and safety breaches. He was responsible for health and safety at the factory.

High Court judge, Mr Justice McDuff, adjourned sentence for financial reports and will pass sentence in Leeds at a date to be fixed.

Mr Catterall grew up in Liverpool and worked at a tyre factory in Speke before joining the Ford factory in Halewood where he worked for many years.

He joined Pyranha in 1997 and was promoted to team leader at the company - which had between 90 and 100 employees - where his wife Pearl and daughter also worked. 

Mackereth said experts helped design the oven where Mr Catterall died, he and maintained he looked at the safety aspects of the design and considered safety in terms of the detailed design.

But Martin Heywood, the investigating inspector at the Health and Safety Executive, said, 'The doors were set to automatically close whenever the electrical supply was switched back on, which meant there was a high risk of someone being trapped inside.

'There had been no risk assessments and staff had not received suitable training on how to use the new ovens and there were no written instructions on cleaning and maintenance.

'If Pyranha Mouldings and the individual prosecuted over Alan's death had properly considered the risks to employees when they designed, installed and operated the ovens then he would still be here today.'

Detective inspector Gary Smith, from Cheshire Police, welcomed the verdicts. He said, 'Alan’s death was a tragedy. He had worked hard at Pyranha Mouldings for many years and sadly ended up losing his life at his place of work.

'Alan’s family have suffered greatly over the years. This has been an extremely difficult process for them and I hope the successful conclusion today will help bring about a degree of closure.'
