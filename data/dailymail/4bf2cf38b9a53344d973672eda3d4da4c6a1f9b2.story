Prince Harry was far from upset about being demoted to fifth-in-line to the throne by the new arrival, saying the news was 'great'.

The prince was on typically cheeky form as he welcomed competitors, even joking that he can't wait to see his brother 'suffer more'.

Questions about the royal baby didn't prevent him from giving competitors the welcome they deserved however, with Harry even performing a traditional 
Maori 'hongi' greeting as he met the Ngati Ranana Maori Dancers during a 
New Zealand Invictus Team reception at New Zealand House in London.

Earlier, the current fourth-in-line spoke about his imminent new niece or nephew, telling journalists that 
Prince George will be thrilled to have a sibling, telling well-wishers 
that his nephew will be 'over the moon' with his little brother or 
sister.

'I think he will be thrilled having 
another small younger brother or sister,' he continued, adding that Kate
 is 'doing the best she can'.

News of the Duchess of Cambridge's second pregnancy comes just days before the start
 of the Invictus Games for wounded and injured soldiers, which have been 
championed by Harry and backed by his brother and sister-in-law.

After welcoming teams from 13 nations 
competing in the event, the prince met competitors at a Dagenham sports 
centre and called on
 Londoners to revive the Olympics spirit.

Sporting
 a black t-shirt emblazoned with the Invictus Games logo, the royal, who
 celebrates his 30th birthday on Saturday, urged those without tickets 
not to miss out on this 'inspirational event'.

Team captains from all 13 competing 
countries were formally welcomed at the central London offices of global
 accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers, an official supporter of the event.

There, Harry posed for a picture with the group, some whom were in wheelchairs or wearing prosthetic limbs, with London's skyline in the background.

While 
Harry was in London, the Duke of Cambridge made his first public 
appearance since the news of a second royal baby broke in Oxford.

The father-to-be was on top form and beamed broadly as he was met by well-wishers including a tiny flower girl.

William
 is also scheduled to join his brother at the Invictus Games later this 
week, although the Duchess of Cambridge's participation is now in doubt.

That, 
however, failed to dampen Prince Harry's enthusiasm either in person or 
in the video message released to welcome competitors to the games.

'I'd
 like to extend the warmest welcome to all competitors taking part in 
the Invictus Games who have now arrived in London,' he said in the 
video.

'I
 know how hard you've been working over the last few months and the 
British public - indeed the world - can't wait to see you compete in 
just a few days' time in our nation's capital city.

'To anyone
 else still thinking about buying tickets to the Games - don't hesitate.
 It's going to be an inspirational event and you won't want to miss 
out.'

More
 than 400 competitors, both serving military personnel and veterans, 
will go head to head in nine adaptive sports at the Queen Elizabeth 
Olympic Park and Lee Valley Athletics Centre in London over four days 
starting on Thursday.

Alongside the UK team will be competitors from the US, Denmark, Estonia, France and Italy, Canada, Holland, Australia, Afghanistan, Georgia, New Zealand and Germany.

Italy's captain Gianfranco Paglia, a serving Italian officer, chatted to Harry and said afterwards: 'For us, the challenge is to let everybody know how important it is for wounded soldiers to go back to wearing the uniform. For us, the first victory is back to service.'

Lieutenant Colonel Paglia is wheelchair-bound after being hit by a hail of bullets when his unit was ambushed while serving in Somalia in 1993.

The officer, who will compete in swimming and powerlifting events, added: 'We wanted Harry to know that we take care of our wounded soldiers and our target is to get them not to civilian life but back to service.'
