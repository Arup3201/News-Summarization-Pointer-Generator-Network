The writer behind the popular Man Repeller blog is to launch a clothing line in collaboration with cult clothing label PJK.

New Yorker Leandra Medine, 24, who previously blamed her disastrous love life on her larger-than-life sense of style, will unveil the collection titled Man Repeller x PJK next spring.

It's expected that the range will feature an array of edgy wares, inspired by Ms Medine's avant-garde tastes and PJK's laid back fashions.

Describing the range PJK's creative director Chelsey Santry said: 'The collection will be wearable insanity - in the coolest sense 
of the word. It will be whimsical, colorful and playful.

'There are leather jackets you can 
wear out at night; quirky graphic Ts, and feminine, girly dresses that 
go under a big army vest.'

While PJK, formerly Patterson J. 
Kincaid, generally sticks between the $98 to $198 price point, MR x 
PJK's silk, chiffon, and cotton dresses, skirts, tops and knits will 
retail for $198 to $398.

News of the collaboration follows Ms Medine's wedding to on-off financier boyfriend Abie Cohen this June. For the occasion she wore an off-the-rack Marchesa gown, white leather vest, and glittery platform sneakers.

This will be her first self-deigned fashion collection, although she has delved into other aspects of the industry since gaining notoriety as a blogger.

Last year she collaborated with jewellery brand Dannijo, designing a number of pieces including a brightly-coloured $550.00 'Arm Candy' bracelet.

And most recently she curated a collection for ASOS, and starred in Uniqlo's People Campaign alongside Natalie Portmanâ€˜s husband Benjamin Millepied.

Some of her favourite designers include Rag & Bone, Miu Miu, Marni, Cut 25 , Isabel Marant, Opening Ceremony and Proenza Schouler and she notes Vogue Japan editor Anna Dello Russo as an inspiration.

It isn't yet known where the Man Repeller x PJK will be stocked but it is believed Ms Medine will host launch events at boutiques across Manhattan.

Revealing the most important piece of fashion advice she's ever been given, she previously told www.i-ella.com: 'People who wear impressive clothes live better lives. Simon Doonan told me that one, he was quoting Vivienne Westwood.'
