What's black and white, slightly seedy and yours for about £1.50?

Meet the newest creation from McDonald's in China, a pair of burgers that could almost be a pun on the ancient Yin-Yang symbol.

While some have questioned the rationale behind the multi-coloured meat feast, it appears the answer may lie in a Chinese saying.

Double the fun? The burgers are certainly eye-catching, but some have claimed their appeal ends there

'Heibai liangdao tongchi' is an expression to describe someone who 'eats from both sides' - meaning they have friends high-up in Government (the white side) and in organised crime - referred to in China as 'black society'.

According to local website The Beijinger, 'the black burger has a black pepper sauce with bits of onions. The white burger was harder to place, but the sauce has a spicy kick with a sweet finish.'

Bun pun: The black and white  burgers are apparently a reference to a Chinese saying

Not all those who tried to burger combo thought it was a hit, and the website Beijing Cream posted a tongue-in-cheek review claiming it 'looks - and tastes - like hell.'

'I would sooner eat a century egg bathed in stinky tofu with a chicken-foot garnish than order this again,' the mystery blogger declared.

A deal for the burgers is available via McDonald's website in China, the Huffington Post reported.

The set meal costs £2.60 (RMB27), but the set of burgers by themselves cost £1.55 (RMB16).
