Two drivers who raced at 70mph on a 30mph road have been jailed after a cyclist was knocked down with such force she suffered five broken bones and her bike was snapped in two.

Helen Beere was injured as she crossed a Coventry 
street when Keith Riley, 31, and Anas Raja, 22, sped towards her after they agreed to race from some traffic lights.

The 40-year-old can only remembers seeing 
headlights on the wrong side of the road and then waking up in the city's 
hospital.

Victim: Helen Beere in hospital after  being run down at 70mph, leaving her with a broken arm, shoulder and two broken legs

Jailed: Keith Riley, 31, and Anas Raja, 22,Â  have been sent to prison for 28 months and 18 months respectively

Impact: This is the remains of the Helen Beere's bike, which broke in two from the impact of the crash

She suffered a broken collar bone, a broken arm and shattered elbow, and
two broken legs and had to be told by police why her body was shattered.

Recovery: Police say Mrs Beere is lucky to be alive but nine months on she still needs crutches to walk

Riley,
 who hit her, sped from the scene while Raja stayed and called an 
ambulance. The pair were jailed at Leamington Spa Crown Court for 28 
months and 18 months respectively.

'I've read about people who killed others while driving so I was pleased they were both jailed immediately,' Mrs Beere said.

'It is worrying that people have such disregard and respect for other people using the road.

'It is unbelievable to think they were racing. I was told they were doing around 70mph.

'I am lucky to be alive, basically. It is what has kept me going for all this time.'

Mrs Beere spent four-and-a-half weeks in hospital and had 12 hours of surgery.

She is still using crutches to walk nine months after the crash.

Her parents moved in with her for six months to help her look after sons Oscar, five, and Jake, 10.

The men who were responsible for her injuries were jailed for a total of 36 months.

Brutal: This image shows how badly broken her arm was after a racer ploughed into her at around 70mph

Broken: The cyclist had several rods had to be inserted to help support her crushed body and this x-ray shows metal plates and pins in her right arm and clavicle

Injury: Her left leg was in a cage for some time to fix her broken leg, which required screws and rods driven into it

Riley was also banned from driving for four years and Raja for two years.

Investigating officer Pc Craig Graves told the court Mrs Beere was 'extremely fortunate' not to die.

He
 said: 'The particular section of the Holyhead Road is a 30mph 
restricted road and the two drivers have very foolishly decided to race 
one another whilst heading out of city.

'It
 is estimated that both vehicles were travelling at speeds more 
consistent with that of a motorway and way in excess of 70mph.

'This
 has shown a total disregard for other road users be they motorists or 
pedestrians. I would like to thank all the witnesses who came forward at
 the time as their help as clearly assisted in a successful prosecution.

'These sentences should serve as a warning to anyone who thinks they can use a public road as a race track.
