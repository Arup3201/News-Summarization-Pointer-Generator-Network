A married couple accused of squatting in a string of multimillion-dollar homes has holed up and refused to pay rent in a luxury home on California's coast.

Two months after Gina and Paul Schwendel signed a lease and moved into a $4.4million home in Del Sur, their landlord, Dennis Simpson, says he has yet to receive any money in rent.

Instead, he tells KGTV, the couple complained that the five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home with waterfront views is uninhabitable.

'Professional tenants': A married couple accused of squatting in a string of multimillion-dollar homes has holed up and refused to pay rent in a luxury home in Del Sur on California's coastline

When Simpson arrived to check on the home, he says he found the garage had been stuffed full of sporting equipment and appliances.

'I said, "You know, you live like a pig. You don't respect this property. I want you out of here,"' Simpson says he told Paul Schwendel.

After another visit following a 24-hour notice, the Schwendels filed a restraining order against Simpson, calling him 'violent, threatening and demeaning.'

The order also stated Simpson 'broke into our home, physically pushed me and my son' and that the Schwendels and their four children are 'scared that he will return to our home and violently act out against us.'

But some believe the claims are just part of the Schwendels' strategy of squatting, as the couple has had to be evicted from three other luxury properties in California.

'This is what I would call a professional tenant,' said eviction attorney Steven Silverstein, who had the Schwendels tossed from another multimillion-dollar home in Newport Beach.

'They come in with a lot of money, a lot of flash, a lot of glitz,' says Silverstein.

The approach has landed the Schwendels in a 10,000-square-foot pad in upscale Orange County and a fourth luxury home in Laguna Beach, all of which they were evicted from, according to KGTV.

Court documents filed in Georgia also show that Paul Schwendel was sued in 2005 by his ex-wife for $100,000 in unpaid child support and $59,000 in late alimony payments.

Nothing in the couple's background was caught by Simpson, who says he believed Schwendel was working a high-paying job.

'I did check his application and he said he made $55,000 a month and he's been working in the business for 14 years,' Simpson said.

'But I found out that wasn't true either... so yes, I do feel that I have been duped.'

A LinkedIn profile for Paul Schwendel lists him as CEO of Evolution Healthcare. Georgia state records indicate that Evolution Healthcare was registered as a limited liability corporation in 2009 by Schwendel.

KGTV said the Schwendels did not sit for an interview, despite a promise from Gina Schwendel. 

Simpson states the next rent check for $12,500 is due on March 1, though he is skeptical that he'll be seeing any money.
