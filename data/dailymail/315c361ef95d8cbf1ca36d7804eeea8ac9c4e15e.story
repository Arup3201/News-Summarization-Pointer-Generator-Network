On Sean Hannity's Fox News show Monday night, Ann Coulter called Melissa Harris-Perry MSNBC's 'token' black host.

Coulter was weighing in on the controversy that broke this week when people started criticizing Harris-Perry for making fun of Mitt Romney's black grandson Kieran on her show.

Harris-Perry made a tearful apology for the comments on a following show, and Mitt Romney himself accepted her apologies, but Coulter didn't understand why Harris-Perry thought it was so funny to begin with.

'What does she think she is at MSNBC?' Coulter asked, alleging that Harris-Perry is the only black host on the liberal network.

Apology: MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry offered an apology to the Romneys and other inter-racial families

Sean Hannity didn't agree with 
Coulter's comments, pointing out that there were plenty of African 
Americans who comment on MSNBC, including the Rev Al Sharpton.

The original controversy started on Harris-Perry's show during what was supposed to be a fun review of the year. Panelists were giving comic captions on photos from key moments of the year when the Romney family photo came up, complete with Mitt holding his baby grandson Kieran.

Comedian Dean Obeidallah had said: 'It really sums up the diversity of the 
Republican party, the RNC. At the convention, they find the one black 
person.'

Kieran, pictured with his mother Andelyne, has been adopted by Mitt Romney's son Ben

And actress Pia Glenn added: 'One of these things is not like the others, one of these things just isn't the same.'

Although Harris-Perry, who is African-American, did not directly ridicule the baby, she said during her apology on MSNBC that the idea behind the segment was the result of 'poor judgment'.

'Given my own family history I identified with that picture and I intended to say positive and celebratory things,' she said.

'But whatever the intent was, the reality was the segment proceeded in a way that was offensive.'

She added: 'My intention was not malicious but I broke the ground rule that families are off limits.'

Forrmer Republican governor Sarah 
Palin was among those who criticized the show, saying  MSNBC 
should be ashamed of itself for allowing the segment to go to air.

'Leftist media hounds are not 
expressing an opinion with this attack; they are expressing a prejudice 
that would never be accepted if it came from anyone else but the 
lib[eral] media,' Palin wrote on her Facebook page in a post 
accompanying the photo of the Romney family.

In the broadcast of her apology, Harris-Perry's voice cracked with emotion as she said the core principle of her show was to advocate diversity.

She said: 'I am deeply sorry that we suggested that inter-racial families are in anyway funny or deserving of ridicule.'

Harris-Perry responded to her critics, saying she was 'genuinely appreciative of everyone who offered criticisms' and adding: 'I am reminded that our fiercest critics can sometimes be our best teachers.'

Obeidallah has also sought to defend himself in an article on the Daily Beast.

He said he had received scores of nasty tweets from people calling him a 'baby-bullying bigot.'

'You may think [my joke was]funny, unfunny, clichÃ©, idiotic, etc. Comedy is subjective,' he wrote.

'But say what you will about my quip, I didn't criticize the Romney family for adopting the baby nor did I mock baby Kieran in any way. Nor would I.

'My joke was about the lack of racial diversity we see at the Republican National Convention - a topic lampooned for years by comedians.
