Sufferers of debilitating conditions like dementia and Parkinson’s face a ‘postcode lottery’ on whether the NHS will pay for their care.

Patients are 18 times more likely to have their care funded in some parts of England than others, government data has revealed.

And those in the north are far more likely to receive financial help than those in the south east.

In the worst area, South Reading, health authorities paid care bills for an average of just 13.2 patients per 50,000 people, while in South Tyneside 232.9 patients per 50,000 people received the help.

Patients living in Salford, Greater Manchester, were six times more likely to have their care paid for than six miles away in Trafford.

And residents of Brent, Greater London, were a fifth as likely to receive the help as those living ten miles away in Richmond, according to figures published by the Health & Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC).

The data showed the number of people in each Clinical Commissioning Group area (CCG) who received NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) – funding for the nursing home fees or home care visits of people with complex medical needs.

Anyone with serious medical conditions, such as those in the final stages of degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s or who are paralysed, should have their care funded by the NHS regardless of their personal finances.

But with budgets squeezed, health authorities have been accused of failing to give the funding to patients who are eligible for it.

The figures revealed staggering differences between regions as well as local areas.

The Thames Valley was the worst region for providing free care, with only 30.9 patients per 50,000 people receiving the funds – less than half the national average of 69.5.

By contrast, those in the Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear area were nearly twice as likely to receive free care than the national average.

Scores of families from across the country have complained to charities about problems obtaining the funding, including suffering long delays and ‘intimidation’ by health authority boards during applications.

Some have been forced to raid savings or sell their homes to pay care bills while they wait for, or appeal, a decision.

Last year the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Parkinson’s and charity Parkinson’s UK carried out an inquiry into the Continuing Healthcare system which found it was ‘not fit for purpose’ and failed ‘vulnerable people and their families at a time when they need the most support’.

The charity’s chief executive Steve Ford said last night: ‘More than a year has passed since we revealed the extent of the systemic failure of tick-box assessors to follow the correct procedures, and the Government is still sticking their head in the sand.

‘They must start holding those responsible for the failings in the NHS Continuing Healthcare system to account and bring an end to the current postcode lottery in care and abysmally poor practice.’

NHS staff and social workers have also reported being ‘under pressure’ to keep patients out of the scheme.

Former adult social care manager at Devon County Council Bernie Crean, 60, quit his job in September after claiming he was pressured by NHS managers because he ‘refused to turn a blind eye’ when the health service ‘repeatedly denied funding’ to eligible patients.

Mr Crean, from Plymouth, said: ‘We have got a massively flawed system and it is a country-wide problem.

‘It is not right for the NHS to look to solve its funding problem by making patients suffer and pushing people away.’

The HSCIC figures showed the number of patients receiving the care funding per 50,000 people aged 18 and over, according to GP practice populations, at the end of September.

They did not take age or socioeconomic factors into account, so areas where there were a higher proportion of older people were more likely to have larger numbers requiring CHC.

However the data shows the same trends as the previous figures released in June which were weighted to reflect population differences.

More than 62,000 patients currently receive CHC in England compared with fewer than 59,000 at the same time last year, but campaigners believe up to 150,000 are entitled to it – and that is likely to increase as the population ages.

An NHS England spokesperson said: ‘The number of people receiving NHS CHC funding can vary from area to area due to differences in population profiles and local services but to ensure a consistent and fair approach, CCGs follow the National Framework to establish eligibility.’
