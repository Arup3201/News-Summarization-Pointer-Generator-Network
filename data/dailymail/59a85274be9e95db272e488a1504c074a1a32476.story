An investigation into the deaths of five cancer patients has found the surgeons involved were ‘dysfunctional’ and ‘secretive’.

Keyhole surgery for stomach and throat cancer was only stopped at Maidstone Hospital in Kent last July, despite whistleblowers raising concerns about patient care three years ago.

A report by the Royal College of Surgeons, carried out five months ago, was made public this week after complaints of a cover-up from the dead patients’ families.

Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust admitted potentially avoidable complications could have contributed to the five deaths between 2012 and 2013.

Three surgeons, Professor Amir Nisar, Haythem Ali and Ahmed Hamouda, were barred from carrying out the procedures, but all have been allowed to continue doing general surgery.

The report says the team was ‘dysfunctional’, their working practices were ‘secretive’, and they had a ‘difficult’ relationship with anaesthetists.

It found there was a high rate of complications associated with the keyhole techniques, and that aftercare for patients was poor.

Dr Paul Sigston, medical director of Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, said: ‘I would again like to apologise to the families involved.’
