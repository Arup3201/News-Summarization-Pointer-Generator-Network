Youngsters left alone to enjoy a harmless Disney cartoon didn't get the fairytale ending they were expecting after the film inadvertently cut to scenes from a porn movie.

The shocking error happened while Georgie Brown's three young children were watching a Lilo and Stitch cartoon at the family home in Fairview, North Carolina.

Ms Brown recorded the film several days earlier on The Disney Channel's Dish network.

Georgie Brown's two-year-old son, three-year-old daughter, pictured, and five-year-old son were watching a Lilo and Stitch cartoon at home when it cut to an adult movie

She went to the kitchen leaving her two-year-old son, three-year-old daughter and five-year-old son in the lounge to watch the PG -rated movie.

A minute into the popular science fiction animation, however, she heard inappropriate noises coming from the lounge and when she returned she saw a man and a woman having sex on the screen.

She toldÂ Fox News: 'I just heard things that probably shouldn't be on Lilo or Stitch. My first thought was the children have changed the channel.'

When she rewound the film and played it back again she saw the cartoon begin to pixilate before an information box appeared which said 'part of the recorded event had been lost due to signal loss'.

The final scenes from a pornographic movie then popped up on the screen and it played for nearly six minutes before the closing credits rolled.

Lilo and Stitch is a science fiction cartoon which has been made by Disney since 2002

'If you can imagine Maggie Simpson sitting on a sofa watching porn that 
was him just sitting there sucking his pacifier kind of clueless,' Brown
said of her youngest child's reaction.

'My five-year-old grabbed his ears 
and ran out of the room screaming, 'I didn't do it,' and the three-year-old 
was sitting there crying.'

The video was so graphic that neither FOX Carolina nor the Disney Channel are allowed to air it.

David Guttey, a contractor for Dish Network who inspected Ms Brown's receiver was astonished to hear what had happened.

He said: 'I've been in the TV industry for 15 years and I've never once seen that.'

Georgie Brown said she heard things that probably shouldn't be on Lilo or Stitch and initially thought the children have changed the channel

Dish Network said it had technology in place to help ensure it delivers the content that subscribers want to watch

Mr Guttey put the mistake down to a technical error and said there was a chance that others who watched or recorded the film, aired on September 7, may have had the same problem.

Ms Brown said since they saw the inappropriate since her three-year-old and five-year-old had mimicked the action and sound of a couple having sex.

In a statement network Dish Network said: 'We have technology in place to help ensure we deliver the content that subscribers want to watch.

'We are working with various partners and our customers to better understand what occurred.'
