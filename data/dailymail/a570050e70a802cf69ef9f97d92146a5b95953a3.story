A British ex-soldier so fascinated by TV series Ice Road Truckers that he flew out to Canada to become one died when his HGV careered off the frozen highway featured in the show.

Former gunner Brett Colley, from Bewdley, Worcestershire, was killed when his truck came off the Alaska Highway - one of the toughest roads in the world - in sub-zero temperatures and plunged down an embankment.

The 45-year-old had been driving the multi-ton, 18-wheeled rig through the remote Pink Mountain region of Canada when the accident happened on November 13. His body has just been flown home, and the funeral takes place this week.

Tragic: The 45-year-old former gunner had moved from Worcestershire to Canada to fulfil his dream by working for a transport company

Father-of-one Mr Colley moved from Bewdley to Lethbridge in Alberta 18 months ago to fulfil an ambition to drive along the treacherous ice roads made famous by reality TV show.

The programme follows HGV drivers as they cross frozen lakes and dangerously thin ice in temperatures of minus 30 degrees in Canada and the USA.

Mr Colley's sister Alex Fidoe, 41, who now lives in Perth, Australia, said the show that fired his imagination.

'Brett loved the outdoors and adventure, and he was hooked on the Ice Road truckers TV show when it first came out in the UK,' she revealed.

'He used to watch it religiously and about two years ago he actually applied to be on the show, but was unsuccessful.

'Typical Brett, he was undeterred and he applied for a job with H and R Transport, which has routes along the ice roads in Canada.

'He joined the company 18 months ago and at first he was doing drives through the US deserts - but his goal was to get a chance to travel the ice roads.

'He finally got his chance about six months ago when they put him on the Alaska Superhighway route that takes in frozen lakes and has been featured on the TV show he loved so much.

'He was really excited when they put him on that route. He'd achieved his ambition after watching the show all those years ago.

'It made us all really proud. I told all my friends that my brother was a real-life ice road trucker.'

Mr Colley was delivering food supplies with a co-driver when their truck inexplicably came off the highway close to Pink Mountain in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia.

The region is famed for its herds of wild bison and takes its name from a mountain that appears pink because of its burnt rock.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are currently investigating the accident, and have interviewed Mr Colley's co-driver, but have told the family it may still take up to six months to discover what went so tragically wrong.

Last night, his grieving mother Rita paid tribute to her 'vibrant' son who had been planning a trip back home for a New Year family reunion.

Mr Colley's wife Svetlana, whom he met in London, was living in Russia with their four-year-old son Misha. He had hoped to gain permanent residency in Canada and move his family out there.

In the meantime, they were planning to meet the ice road trucker in Bewdley for the family get-together.

'Brett was really looking forward to being reunited with his wife and son and the rest of the family,' said his mother.

'It was going to be a big do. Even his sister, who had emigrated to Australia, was coming home.

'He had recently applied for permanent residency in Canada and was hoping to move his family out there for good.Â

'His death has hit us all very hard but we know he was doing something that he really enjoyed.'

Mrs Colley, from Bewdley, said the North American transport company employed her son after being impressed by his CV, which included the truck driving skills he had learned while serving with the 39th Regiment Royal Artillery about 20 years ago.

'He spent about six years in the Army after joining as a teenager, and that's where he got his HGV licence,' she explained. 'He was involved in the clean-up operation after the Falklands conflict.

'He also later did some work for the United Nations in Bosnia and Croatia. He loved the Army but he wanted to explore the world and had a real passion for travelling and adventure. He was a real outdoors type and enjoyed life to the full.'

Sister Alex added: 'He was a very vibrant person, full of personality. He was one of those people who lit up a room when he walked in. If you sent him down the street for a loaf of bread it would take him two hours because everyone he bumped into, he knew. He had such a big heart. He was very kind-natured and very much a family man. He was always smiling.'
