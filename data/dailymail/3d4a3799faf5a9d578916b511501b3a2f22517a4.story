Australian swimming star Grant Hackett has been pictured putting himself through a gruelling 90-minute swimming session at a Gold Coast pool.

Hackett, 34, was joined poolside by Miami Club and national swimming coach Denis Cotterell during an afternoon in which he spent more than five hours at the Miami Swimming Club, at the southern end of the Gold Coast.

The triple-Olympic gold medallist has previously denied that he is using his base on Queensland's glitzy strip to mount a comeback to competitive swimming, or that he is charging toward the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Hackett's manager Chris White said he believes these are the first pictures of the star seen in the pool since he walked away from the sport in 2008.

The 34-year-old told Daily Mail Australia he was just enjoying his return to the water after a tumultuous six years since his retirement. 

'I'm thoroughly enjoying being back on the Gold Coast,' he said, 'and I'm keen to remain fit, enjoy a healthy lifestyle and re-establish myself with the community here.'

'Swimming is the ideal mix for both.'

He would not be drawn into speculation regarding his future in the sport, other than to say today's training regime was just part of his goal to 'remain fit.'

Hackett's motivation to move back home was largely driven by a decision to be closer to his family.

It's understood  the swimmer is back training for personal reasons, and not as part of any competitive tilt to return to the national swimming circuit or to add to his medal haul.

Hackett collected three gold medals during his career, winning both the Sydney and Athens Olympic 1500 metres and claiming a team gold for his part in the 4x200m freestyle relay at Sydney, in 2000.

Although his main motivation is to improve his mental and physical well-being, It is believed that he may be in the selection ranks for the Miami Club when it competes in next year's Australian titles. 

Hackett told the Herald Sun last month that he has no plans to make a tilt for Rio in 2016 mainly because of his age. 'I would be 36 for Rio,' he said. 'That's probably just getting on a bit too much.'

Happier times: Hackett is looking a much happier man in the pool

He was joined by several other club members during the five-hour session on the Gold Coast

Hackett finished his 90-minute session on Tuesday under direction from Cotterell who remains the number one man at the head of the national coaching team.

Hackett was pictured completely at ease back in the pool - smiling and enjoying himself surrounded by members of the Miami club.

The fitter, happier looking Hackett makes for a stark contrast to what has been seen of the star in recent times, most notably when he was  pictured in a dazed state walking around Melbourne's Crown Casino lobby wearing nothing but a towel.

It is just one of a number of compromising situations he has been in since his 2008 retirement and divorce to singer Candice Alley.

Police have questioned Hackett over the Crown Casino incident and a Victorian spokeswoman confirmed inquiries into the incident are ongoing.

Police spokeswoman Sharon Darcy told The Australian that a 34-year-old Queensland man was questioned  over an incident at a Melbourne hotel on February 22.

'He has been released pending further inquiries,' She said. She said police were unable to comment further as the investigation was ongoing.

It comes as a difficult year comes to a halt for Hackett who spoke to Daily Mail Australia earlier this year about his his life-changing five-week stint in an Arizona rehab clinic where he was admitted for a sleeping pill addiction.

He confessed that his addiction to Stilnox sleeping pills played a major role in him seeking help.

At the time he also spoke about a 'sustained amount of pressure and stress' and his bitter divorce to Alley.

Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Australia Hackett said he felt reluctant and 'scared' to go to the US clinic - but was persuaded to go by his dad.

'I was in denial about [help] for a long time, I thought I could manage everything and anything,’ he said in July.

'Because of my athletic background I thought it was a weakness to say "I need help",' he said.

Hackett’s father Neville previously said the family staged a form of intervention to get the former sportsman into ‘one of the best’ rehab facilities in the world. 

Three months since his return from the US and it appears that advice is paying off with former great now looking much healthier and happier after packing his bags in Melbourne and moving back to the two places it all began - the Gold Coast and  the pool.
