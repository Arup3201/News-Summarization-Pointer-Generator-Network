The video, from the  Shanghai Metro carriage shows how the man, who is sitting next to a middle-aged female passenger, slowly topples to one side, causing her to move speedily out of the way as he slides onto the seat.

After lying there for a few seconds, he falls onto the ground unconscious, just as the train is breaking for the next station.

The footage shows how one woman was in such a panic to get away that she hit the doors, while a middle-aged man falls to the floor and struggles to get back up.

A ticket collector at the Shanghai underground told local media that passengers had alerted staff on their way out, saying that a foreigner that may have a disease had collapsed on the carriage and that they were worried it was Ebola. 

But there was no official statement from the underground officials about what had happened to the man.

Chinese public transport passengers are already on heightened awareness anyway after a spate of arson attacks and knife attacks that has seen increased security, and recent publicity over the Ebola virus has raised fears even more.

China has responded forcefully to the Ebola outbreak in Africa, a continent where it has made sizable investments and actively fostered diplomatic relations.

Starting in May, it began sending protective clothes, disinfectants, thermal detectors, medicines and, more recently, the government kicked off a two-year aid mission that includes its first-ever dispatch overseas of emergency medical experts.

At home, China has for several days screened travellers from West African nations. 

Photos in China's state press showed Nigerians wearing protective clothing during checks in airport clinics, which officials indicate have upset some incoming visitors.

They have already warned that countries affected by the latest outbreak will not be allowed to send athletes to the Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games.

China also said that from Saturday new border controls will include stricter inspections on inbound airlines from regions affected by Ebola, while stepped-up sanitary measures will apply to incoming vehicles and goods. 

The government also warned its citizens about the risks of travel to affected regions.
