A young man has been released after being locked up for four years for a sexual assault he did not commit.

Johnathan Montgomery, 26, has always maintained his innocence after he was convicted of sexually molesting a ten-year-old girl when he was a teenager.

There were emotional scenes as he walked free from state prison in Virginia to be met by his loyal parents who have never doubted that their son did not commit the crime.

Wrongly convicted: Johnathan Montgomery was convicted in 2008 (pictured left) of molesting a ten-year-old girl but was released this week (right) after his supposed victim recanted

'The truth sets you free,' Mr Montgomery said on Tuesday night.

Among the few possessions he left prison
with was a Sudoku book that included the quote: 'If you're 
going through hell, keep on going.'

Liar: Elizabeth Paige Coast has been charged with perjury after pretending that she had been molested aged ten

He spent four years in Greensville Correctional Center after being convicted in 2008 of assaulting Elizabeth Paige Coast outside her grandmother's home in Hampton.

The two had been childhood friends.

His accuser has now recanted her story and has been charged with perjury.

Mr Montgomery, who lost more than 100lb  during his time in prison, was given a conditional pardon by Virginia governor Bob McDonnell.

He had always maintained his innocence throughout his incarceration. 

Mr Montgomery was freed in time to celebrate Thanksgiving with his family at his father's home in Vale, North Carolina.

He told ABC 13 News that he was looking forward to eating what he wanted and spending time with his family following his release.

Prosecutors
said Coast made up the sexual assault after her parents caught her 
looking at pornographic websites in 2007 when she was 17.

She then 
allegedly made up a story of prior sexual abuse to explain her 
behavior.

Mr Montgomery was living across the 
street from Ms Coast, now 22, in Hampton, Virginia, at the time the alleged abuse
took place.

The woman, then 17, said Montgomery assaulted her outside her grandmother's house in Hampton in 2000 when he was 14 and she was ten.

Prosecutors said Coast did not think her allegation of abuse would impact upon Mr 
Montgomery because he had moved to North Carolina in 2004.

But based on her allegation he was convicted of aggravated sexual battery and other charges and sentenced to more than seven years in prison.

Although he expressed his relief at being released, Mr Montgomery said he did not forgive Coast for accusing him. 

Mr Montgomery, who is planning to write a
book about his ordeal, said she must now has to 'deal with the 
consequences,' of her actions.

The 26-year-old said he eventually to work with a friend in Florida, possibly in construction.

Changed man: Mr Montgomery plans to write a book about his experiences after spending four years in jail for a crime he did not commit. Right, at the age of 14, the year he was supposed to have molested a girl

Lies: Elizabeth Paige Coast has been charged with perjury after admitting to making up the allegations of sexual assault against Mr Montgomery

Allegation: Prosecutors said Ms Coast had made up the story of abuse after her parents found her looking at pornographic videos online, according to reports

Hampton Circuit Judge Randolph T. West had thrown out Mr Montgomery's convictions earlier this month and ordered that he be released from prison.

However when his relatives went to the prison to pick him up they were told the judge did not have jurisdiction, according to News Channel 3.

Under Virginia law, only the state Court of Appeals could exonerate Mr Montgomery or the governor could pardon him.

Governor McDonnell pardoned him and called Mr Montgomery personally to apologize for his horrific ordeal..
