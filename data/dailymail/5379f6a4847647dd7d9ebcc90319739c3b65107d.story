Footage has emerged of a cyclist flipping over the wheels of his handlebar while travelling along a freeway.

The man, believed to be named Anthony, was cycling 50km an hour with a group of others in Byron Bay - north of Sydney - when he came across a piece of aluminium in the cycle way.

Before he noticed the debris, he ran over it which caused him to fly off his bike.

Concerns about Anthony's condition were laid to rest when Mr Hardy commented on his video saying his friend is doing okay

The video was uploaded on YouTube by user Jason Hardy on Monday and has since gained more than 585,000 views.

What's more astonishing in the video is a fellow cyclist's quick reflexes, as he swerves around Anthony to avoid further injuries. 

Footage also shows the aftermath of the crash - Anthony's battered bike and one of its wheels fallen off.

Concerns over Anthony's condition were laid to rest when Mr Hardy commented on his video saying his friend is doing okay.

However the same can't be said about Anthony's bike as it appears that its beyond repair.
