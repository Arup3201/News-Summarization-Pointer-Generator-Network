Eugenie Bouchard is fast becoming the new queen of Centre Court and the can seal her coronation with victory over Simona Halep in the Wimbledon semi-finals and then on Sunday in the final.

The 20-year-old Canadian is named after Princess Eugenie, the daughter of Prince Andrew, and it turns out that her twin sister is also named after royalty. Yes, you guessed it - Beatrice, after Princess Eugenie's sister.

A picture of the pair has emerged of the sisters - the Canadians, not the royals - dressed up as raunchy police officers, which will only delight the legion of new fans Bouchard is winning over thanks to her superb tennis at SW19.

But as well as her tennis skills - she was WTA's Newcomer of the Year and the second Canadian to reach the semi-finals of a grand slam - Eugenie has proven she has a fun side off the court. 

The Montreal-born star and her student sister Beatrice, who is six minutes older than her, were named after the Princesses due to their mother's love of the royal family.

Bouchard said: 'Maybe it 
looks like my parents were royal obsessed, it makes me feel a little bit
 more at home in England among my fellow royals.

'When I was young my 
Mum gave me a magazine with the two princesses in it and I still keep it
 on my bedside table, my brother is Prince William. I think they are 
just nice names that they liked.

'We keep in touch and she's a huge supporter. We're opposites but very close.'

Eugenie's tennis career started at the tender age of five and by the age of 12, she was living in Florida, where she was coached by Nick Saviano and became best friends with British tennis star Laura Robson.

Proving that she's not just a pretty face, she once considered a career as a physician and has made appearances on CTV's The Social and as a weather anchor on CTV Montreal.

With her Hollywood looks and dazzling
 skills, even before her appearance at this year’s tournament she had 
attracted a worldwide fan base knows as the 'Genie Army'.

At
 other tournaments the adoring supporters throw cuddly toys at her, 
although she says Wimbledon spectators are ‘too proper’ to behave that 
way.

Miss Bouchard is rumoured to be in a 
romance with Canadian ice hockey star Alex Galchenyuk, but keeps her 
tennis contemporaries at a distance.

She
 was close to British star Laura Robson, but Bouchard said last month: ‘I don’t think the tour is the place to 
have friends.’

It is a 
clear sign of the single-minded determination of the young woman who 
started playing tennis aged five in the English speaking Montreal suburb
 of West Mount.

She said: 'Ever since I was young, whatever I did I wanted to do it to the best of my abilities.

'When
 I came home from school I would be the one doing my homework while my 
siblings would be watching TV and putting it off until later.

Focus: She says she was always very determined, and to excel at her sport you have to be very disciplined

‘I was always very determined, and to excel at this sport you have to be really disciplined and motivated.

'I asked my parents if I could play more so they put me in groups where there was more actual tennis and it went from there.

‘Nine is very young to decide what you want to do in life but that is pretty much when I decided.'

'Meanwhile my twin retired at age six. We are very close but opposite in many ways. I never needed to be pushed.'
