Davy Jones, the lead singer of the 1960s group The Monkees, has died after suffering a massive heart attack. He was 66.

The lead singer of the Daydream 
Believer group – which also consists of original members Micky Dolenz, 
66, and 70-year-old Peter Tork – passed away in his sleep this morning at his Florida home.

His publicist, Helen Kensick, confirmed that he died in Indiantown, where he lived.

An official from the medical 
examiner's office for Martin County, Florida, said they 
received a phone call from the Martin Memorial Hospital informing them 
that Davy had died.

A spokesman for the Martin County Sheriff’s Office said he was pronounced dead after being taken to hospital in the town of Stuart.

The spokesman said they are investigating Jones’s death but said there do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding his death.

A statement released by the Sherriff’s Office said:  ' A witness has stated that earlier this morning he was at 9955 SW Fox Brown Road in Indiantown, Florida, with David Jones (He stated Mr. Jones began to complain of not feeling well and having trouble breathing.

'Martin County Fire Rescue responded and transported Mr. Jones to Martin Health System. Stuart, where he was pronounced deceased.  At this time there do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.  Family has been notified.'

His bandmate, drummer Micky
 Dolenz, released a statement to TMZ saying he had 'bad dreams all night
 long' before learning of his friend's death this morning.

'Can't believe it...Still in shock...had bad dreams all night long,' Dolenz said, adding: 'My love and prayers go out to Davy's girls and family right now.'

Bassist Peter Tork released a statement saying: 'It is with great sadness that I reflect on the sudden passing of my long-time friend and fellow-adventurer, David Jones.'

'His talent will be much missed; his gifts will be with us always. My deepest sympathy to Jessica and the rest of his family.

'Adios, to the Manchester Cowboy.'

Michael
 Nesmith who didn't join the original members of the group, Davy, Micky 
and Peter - in reuniting for a 45th anniversary tour last year - also 
revealed he will 'miss' the pop icon.

He
 wrote: 'I will miss him, but I won’t abandon him to mortality. I will 
think of him as existing within the animating life that insures 
existence.'

The 911 call that was made to call an ambulance to Davy's home can be heard below.

The woman on the phone is heard telling the operator that she needs an ambulance and urged 'hurry'.

She was then heard shouting at other people in the background.

Davy leaves behind four daughters, 
Talia Elizabeth, 43, and Sarah Lee, 40 from his marriage to Linda 
Haines, and Jessica Lillian, 30, and 23-year-old Annabel Charlotte from 
his marriage to Anita Pollinger.

Monkee-ing around: Davy joined The Monkees in 1965 along with Micky, Peter and Michael Nesmith and became a television hit

The pop icon – who was born in 
Manchester, North West England – married 33-year-old TV presenter 
Jessica Pacheo, who he met in 2006, in August 2009.

In May 2011, the singer said he was having some of the happiest times he's ever had in his life with Jessica.

He explained: 'We have love. We have 
friendship. She’s also aware of what I’ve done in music, and the fact 
that I no longer really need to prove anything.' 

Davy joined The Monkees in 1965 along
 with Micky, Peter and Michael Nesmith – who did not rejoin the group 
for their shows last year – and they went on to record a number of hit 
records including Daydream Believer, Last Train To Clarksville and I'm a
 Believer.

Jones was born on December 30, 1945, 
in Manchester, England. His long hair and British accent helped Jones 
achieve heartthrob status in the United States.

Last year, the pop/rock group - who 
were created to appear in their own TV show in the 60s - reformed for a 
45th anniversary tour, but they ended up scrapping some dates amid 
reports of fall outs between the group.

At the time, Micky wrote on his 
Facebook page: 'Dear Fans and Friends, The Monkee Tour has, indeed, been
 cancelled but for reasons that I cannot discuss at this time.

Paying tribute: Various celebrities including Eva Longoria, Elijah Wood and Stephen Fry, paid tribute to the singer on Twitter

'I can say
 that the reasons pertain to business and are internal matters.

'Needless to say, I am disappointed 
but the situation was unavoidable and I want to apologise to all the 
fans out there who will not be able to experience what was a wonderful 
show indeed. Regretfully, Micky (sic).'

According to The Monkees website, Monkees.com, Jones left the band in late 1970.

In the summer of 1971, he recorded a 
solo hit Rainy Jane and made a series of appearances on American variety
 and television shows, including Love American Style and The Brady 
Bunch.

Jones played himself in a widely 
popular Brady Bunch episode, which aired in late 1971. In the episode, 
Marcia Brady, president of her school's Davy Jones fan club, promised 
she could get him to sing at a school dance.

By the mid-1980s, Jones teamed up with former Monkee Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz and promoter David Fishof for a reunion tour.

Their popularity prompted MTV to re-air The Monkees series, introducing the group to a new audience.

In 1987, Jones, Tork and Micky Dolenz
 recorded a new album, Pool It. Two years later, the group received a 
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In the late 1990s, the group filmed a special called Hey, Hey, It's the Monkees.

'R.I.P. Davy Jones' is now trending on Twitter with celebrities starting to pay their respects.

Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria tweeted: 'My heart is sad that my favorite Monkee Davey Jones has passed away! #I'mABeliever'.

And Melrose Place star Lisa Rinna retweeted Eva's message, writing: 'Ditto! He was my 1st crush!'
