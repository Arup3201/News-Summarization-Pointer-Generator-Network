An eight-year-old Oklahoma girls' room is filled with thousands of roaches, but the pests don't bug her at all.

Second grader Shelby Counterman, from outside Tulsa, has been taking care of a colony of Madagascar hissing cockroaches for the last five years as her pets.

She began with a small batch of male cockroaches, but she later decided that she wanted them to breed and brought in females.

The girl contacted her local news anchor after hearing that the journalist hated the animal she keeps as a pet

The African insects, which have no wings and a single pair of antennae, began multiplying exponentially.

The girl's mother Meg says that her daughter first became interested in creepy crawlies when she was 18-months old.

However the invertebrate keeper was shocked when she heard a local news anchor, News on 6's LeAnne Taylor, say that she detested the hissing bugs.

Shelby sent a picture to the journalist and invited her to fight her fears and meet her beloved pets.  

The elementary school student keeps her pets in special plastic containers, as well as aquariums with Vaseline linings to keep her prized possessions from escaping and scampering around the house.

The Countermans also keep a bearded dragon lizard named Toothless in case any members of the bug collection, which also includes Indian cockroaches, escape. 

Madagascar hissing cockroaches are one of the largest species of roach, and can grow up to three inches in length, according to Orkin. 

Males make a hissing sound for mating by expelling air through slits in its stomach, though the bugs also make their namesake noise when they are alarmed.

The scavengers, active mostly at night, eat fruits and vegetables and can live for as long as five years.

Some states place restrictions on the importation of the roaches because of fear they could become an invasive species in the wild. 

After atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, rumors spread that only cockroaches survived the blasts.

To test the popular myth, which was spread during the Cold War, the team behind Discovery's Mythbusters subjected cockroaches to three levels of radioactive metal cobalt 60. 

They started with a dose of 1,000 radon units (rads) which could kill a person in 10 minutes, then upped the dose to 10,000 - the strength of the blast at Hiroshima - and 100,000 rads for a handful of unfortunate insects.

They monitored the cockroaches for 30 days, looking for signs of cellular damage.

After a month, half of the insects exposed to the lowest dose were alive and 10 per cent of those exposed to 10,000 rads survived. 

The experiment seems to confirm the myth that the insects can survive a nuclear blast, although all those exposed to the highest dose of radiation perished.

It's thought the cockroach’s ability to survive is because of its simple body and cell cycles, which only renew once a week, leaving radiation few opportunities to attack, compared with humans whose cells are constantly splitting.
