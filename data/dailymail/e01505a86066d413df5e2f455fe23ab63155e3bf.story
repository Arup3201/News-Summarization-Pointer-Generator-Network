The mother of actor Jason Patric's son, Gus, has made some shocking allegations against the actor as the two currently are engaged in a bitter custody battle over the boy, for whom Patric was only supposed to be a 'sperm donor.'

In an exclusive interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Patric's ex-girlfriend Danielle Schreiber claims that Patric is unstable, abusive and made anti-Semitic comments about her and others.

The author of the lengthy profile of Patric's judicial rival concedes early in her report that she is a 'friendly acquaintance' of Schreiber.

Gus: In the midst of a nasty custody battle, Schreiber claims Patric was abusive

Schreiber tells the magazine that Patric was only supposed to be a sperm donor so she could have a child and raise it - even if that meant doing so as a single parent. She also outlines some of the abuse she claims she suffered at the hands of the man who is a leader in the fathers'-rights movement.

'In September 2005, after Schreiber upset Patric, she claims he used 
force against her for the first time, grabbing her wrists and pushing 
her toward a wall in his Santa Monica home, which resulted in Schreiber 
slamming her head,' reporter Vanessa Grigoriadis writes in her piece.

'The next morning, Jason called me and told me he 
loved me, for the first time,' Schreiber says.

In another violent encounter, 'Patric was 
sports-betting and drinking, even peeing on a dresser and another time 
in a closet at his New York home. She claims Patric threw a jar of 
almond butter at her when he found she hadn't put on the lid tight, and 
hit her in the face with a land-line phone, causing contusions and 
bruises that lasted more than a week.'

She claims that Patric also broke his hand when he punched a wall in the middle of one of their fights.

The couple broke up in 2008, but reconciled in 2011. According to Schreiber, the abuse continued.

'[H]e turned nasty on her again, hurling anti-Semitic epithets like "Ms.
 Jew Schreiber" and "Jew c***" at her. (According to an e-mail obtained 
by Rolling Stone that appears to be from Patric, he commented, "F*** 
THOSE JEW MOTHERF*****S," while discussing a business issue with 
Schreiber.),' Grigoriadis writes.

Denied: Patric denied all of Schreiber's allegations in the Rolling Stone article outlining the alleged abuse

The couple again broke up after their brief reconciliation, at which point Patric filed a paternity suit demanding shared custody of Gus.

Patric responded to the allegations with a statement to the magazine. 

All these false allegations against me from [Schreiber] and her legal 
team are baseless and without merit. They are an attempt to disparage me
 after their loss in the Court of Appeal. I will not legitimize the 
questions posed by Rolling Stone. There isn't one shred of evidence to 
any of this slander…. I will happily present all of my evidence at 
trial, and will very soon have Gus back in my arms. I also will continue
 to refuse to disparage my son's mother in public. I don't intend to 
alienate him from her. The only one that is hurt by this is Gus. He will
 soon be old enough to know the truth."
