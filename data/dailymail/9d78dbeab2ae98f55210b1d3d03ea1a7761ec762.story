Shopping is fun, but dragging a reluctant man around the shops with you can diminish the pleasure somewhat.

For women in China, however, help is at hand with the introduction of 'husband storage' - fully equipped rooms where men can sit down, have a little sleep, and tut about their wives' spending habits to their hearts' content.

Shopping malls across the country are introducing laogong jicun chu (literal translation: 'husband cloakroom) which have proved a huge hit with spendthrift husbands who don't want to trail around the shops.

A trip to the shopzzzz: Husbands in China catch up on sleep at a 'husband cloakroom' while their wives shop

Husband cloakrooms, as indicated by the sign above, offer free internet, chairs, tables and even wifi to men

With chairs, tables, wifi and even a bar in some of them, they are attractive places for men who would rather snooze than cruise the mall.

Some have viewing platforms or glass sides so the men can try to keep tabs on their credit card-toting other halves as they dart from shop to shop.

Judging by these pictures, however, most men use them to simply have a break and rest their feet.

One of the first husband cloakrooms appeared in Shenzen in 2010, but they are now growing in popularity across the country and found in malls in Guigang City, Qiqihaer, and Tianchang, among other places.

Not all the commenters on kotaku.com which highlighted the new trend were convinced by the innovation in husband daycare.

One said: 'Why don't you just stay HOME?  Are you afraid she'll meet another man - one who likes shopping as much as she does?'
