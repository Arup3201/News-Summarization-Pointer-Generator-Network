Shinji Kagawa has admitted that last season was tough for him, but insists he can use his experience to help him progress this year.

The 25-year-old signed for Manchester United in 2012, but has struggled to carve out a place for himself in the side.

And the former Dortmund midfielder admitted that last season was particularly difficult. 

'When I look back, last season was tough,' Kagawa told ESPN. 'I will use that frustration as a trigger to express myself this season, challenging myself to do new things.

Competition: Shinji Kagawa will likely have to displace Juan Mata if he wants to start regularly for United

Boss: Louis van Gaal's formation for United should favour the midfielder, as he won't be forced to play wide

'I'll work hard to achieve goals and results. I'm really enjoying myself, it's my third year with United and I know my teammates very well.'

Kagawa certainly has plenty to prove to Louis van Gaal and the Japan international will know that to start regularly he will likely have to oust Juan Mata from the side.

But that challenge should hold no fears for Kagawa, who played a vital role in Dortmund's two recent Bundesliga titles.

In the latter his goals and assists even made up for an injury that kept Mario Gotze out for almost a year.
