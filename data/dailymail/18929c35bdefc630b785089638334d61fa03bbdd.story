A senior journalist who was part of the original Newsnight expose into Jimmy Saville child-abuse allegations warned the BBC director general not to cover-up why the report was dropped.

The leaked email suggests BBC chief George Entwistle ignored a pressing plea
from investigative  reporter Liz MacKean, about 
his ‘misleading statements’ regarding the content of the cancelled programme.

He declined to speak to Ms MacKean about the matter despite her urgent email sent 12 days ago but has since spoken to senior BBC management about her version of events.

Jimmy Savile has been described as one of the most prolific child sex abusers of all time

More than 200 people have come forward to say they were abused by the TV star

In the email to the director general, seen by The Independent, 
she said: ‘Worst of all has been what seems like a concerted effort to 
make it appear that our story was about something else, something that 
could be dropped and forgotten ahead of fulsome tribute programmes.

'It is this which seems to be fuelling the damaging claims of a cover-up.’

The damaging leaked email comes ahead of a Panorama investigation into Jimmy Savile, due to air 
on Monday, which is expected to look into why the BBC dropped its 
original Newsnight report on the TV star last year.

But Mr 
Entwistle has refused to be interviewed for the programme - citing legal
advice that he should restrict his statements to the police, official 
inquiries and a commons committee hearing on Tuesday.

MPs are now demanding that every BBC email linked to the decision by Newsnight to drop an investigation into Jimmy Savile’s abuse of teenage girls should be made public.

Correspondence leading all the way to the top of the corporation should be disclosed in a bid to retain public trust, they insisted.

It follows the emergence of a leaked e-mail which appears to cast more doubt on the BBC’s stated reason on why the current affairs show dropped the programme.

The memo suggests Newsnight journalists had been ‘focusing on allegations of abuse’ rather than, as has been claimed was the case by the BBC, on the allegation of a failure by police to look into the case properly.

The email from a press officer shows that, by December 7 last year, the BBC was at an advanced enough stage to be readying ‘lines to take’ when questioned about the planned broadcast.

It reveals that the BBC was conscious that it would create difficult questions about why the corporation had not investigated the star when he was alive.

In the email, the press officer admits that ‘we may well need to do a bit of managing around this’.

There were also growing calls last night for the BBC’s director of news Helen Boaden to appear in front of MPs to give her version of events.

While much of the attention has focused on Mr Entwistle and what he knew, insiders have pointed out that the prime focus should instead be on Miss Boaden.

Unlike Mr Entwistle, she is said to have known the outline of what was in the Newsnight investigation.

MPs are questioning why she had not used her knowledge of the allegations to get the BBC to pull the Savile tribute programmes last Christmas.

Last night MPs called for all relevant emails to be published.

This could include any messages sent between Newsnight editor Peter Rippon, deputy director of news Stephen Mitchell and Miss Boaden.

Tory MP Rob Wilson, who received the leaked email from a BBC insider, has been tirelessly campaigning to get to the bottom of the Newsnight case.

He said: ‘I think at some point certainly all the internal evidence that is collected should be published as part of any report in the same way a select committee would do that.’

Conservative MP, John Whittingdale, who chairs the culture, media and sport select committee, said in order to ‘restore credibility’ all ‘relevant evidence’, such as emails, should be made public. But he added this should be done as part of Nick Pollard’s BBC independent inquiry into Newsnight.

Another select committee member Tory MP, Philip Davies, said: ‘I think the BBC may well have to [publish the emails] because I think they are in a very serious situation.

‘Again it comes back to the point that this is their phone-hacking moment and it will get to a stage where people will want to see what the evidence is to make up their own mind.’

MPs also said Miss Boaden may in the 
coming weeks have to appear in front the culture, media and sport select
committee which is quizzing Mr Entwistle about the Savile scandal on 
Tuesday.

Mr Wilson 
said: ‘There are questions whichever way you look at it.

'If George 
Entwistle’s version of events is correct then it means Helen Boaden knew
that there were issues to do with the transmission of the Savile 
tribute programmes because she knew that there was a Jimmy Savile 
investigation going on.’

He
said presuming she had known about the content he questioned why she 
had not thought it ‘completely inappropriate’ to let the Savile tribute 
shows go out.

The MP added: ‘I have already written to John Whittingdale suggesting that he may wish to call both Rippon, Newsnight reporters and Boaden before him.’

Mr Whittingdale has said his committee would ‘reserve the right’ to call other people in if there were still questions to be answered.

A BBC spokesman said of the press office email: ‘This ridiculous story in no way casts doubt on what the BBC has previously said on this. It is simply an exchange between a junior press officer and the Newsnight producer asking for further information about the Jimmy Savile investigation.’
