While University students are often stereotyped as bookworms with no common sense, new research has shown that they are actually picking up vital life skills while studying.

Among them are the ability to turn on a grill, how to set up the internet, and how to budget.

The list does little to undermine stereotypes however, as playing pub games, blagging essays and the effectiveness of napping all come high up.

Other strange pieces of wisdom picked up between library sessions include the fact that fridges don't clean themselves, and why it is a bad idea to eat mould.

A list of the top 50 'life skills' gained while at Uni has been published, revealing that students learn how to study all night and survive three days without sleep

A spokeswoman for Disney, which conducted the research to mark the release of Disney Pixar's Monsters University, said: 'No matter which walk of life you come from, it would seem that university is a great leveller.

'Learning day to day basics such as budgeting, how to book a doctor's appointment and using a washing machine along with finding out who you are and want to become is integral to the whole university experience.

'There's definitely a valuable alternative curriculum at Uni with some of it more fun than others.

While some practical skills were picked up, such as basic DIY and how to tune a television, the benefits of napping were also in the top 50

'Not only does our research confirm this but it also reveals this is not particular to just today's generation of university students it also applies to previous generations.'

Two thirds of students said that the experience of moving away from home had been a 'real eye opener' with nearly half saying that they were shocked by how little they knew when mum and dad were no longer around.

In fact new students called home on average 20 times a month to check how to do things, though that lessened as time went on.

Luckily for parents, however, those surveyed also said they only really started to appreciate home after they had gone.

It took people four months to feel settled in their new accomodation, with five months passing before they knew who their friends were going to be.

Among the hardest challenges were learning to live with strangers, making new friends, and mixing with people from different backgrounds.
