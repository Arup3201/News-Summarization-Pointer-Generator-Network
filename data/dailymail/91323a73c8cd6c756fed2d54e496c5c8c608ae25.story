Captured: James Cameron, 50, was on the run in New Mexico after escaping Maine where he faces jail for downloading child porn

A former prosecutor, convicted of downloading child pornography, has been arrested following a countrywide manhunt after he jumped bail and went on the run.

James Cameron, 50, was caught on Sunday morning as police pounced on him leaving a restroom at a store in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Prior to his convictions, the pedophile had been considered one of Maine's leading drug prosecutors and was assistant attorney-general.

Marshals from Maine’s Violent Offender Task Force traced Cameron to the New Mexico area after he disappeared on November 15.

Colleagues in Albuquerque took up the case and arrested the fugitive after he was seen at the store which sells books, DVDs, video games and electronics.

He was captured with no struggle, according to a U.S. Marshals' press release.

The pedophile was still driving the Audi in which he had fled Maine but had changed the number plates. It was unclear how he had financed the trip, authorities said.

New Mexico is around 2,400 miles from Maine and shares a border with Mexico. Cameron had given up his passport as part of bail conditions.

Cameron was being held at a prison in Rio Rancho and is scheduled to appear in federal court today before being returned to Maine.

Cameron went on the run on November 15, hours after an appeals court in Boston upheld seven of 13 convictions for possessing and downloading child pornography of girls as young as four.

The disgraced prosecutor had already several months in jail after being found guilty of possessing child porn in 2011.

After visiting his ex-wife and son in Maine two weeks ago, Cameron's ankle bracelet alerted police that he had left home after midnight without the permission of his parole officer.

Authorities were then unable to locate him after he cut the device off. 

Police kept his disappearance secret for four days as they followed up leads. It is unclear whether Cameron will face new charges for absconding.

On the run: Cameron fled Maine after an appeals court upheld his conviction for child porn possession and was found two weeks later in Albuquerque, New Mexico

He was sentenced to 16 years in 
prison in March last year however was released less than six months later
while his case was appealed. 

Cameron is due to be re-sentenced and any prison time for his escape will be added on to his sentence.
