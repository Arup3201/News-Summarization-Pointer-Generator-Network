Jimmy Savile: The predatory paedophile had full access to patients at Broadmoor Hospital in Berkshire and intervened in a staff dispute

More than 500 people have reportedly been abused by Jimmy Savile, new figures show, as shocking evidence emerged of how the pervert talked his way into the heart of government.

Details of his close relationship with
 those in power came as research showed that his youngest victim was just two years old.

The research by the NSPCC was commissioned by the BBC's
 Panorama as part of an investigation into Savile's links to government.

Whitehall officials referred to the predatory paedophile as ‘Doctor’ as they allowed him to intervene in a staff dispute at Broadmoor Hospital.

The DJ and Top of the Pops presenter even gained direct access to then health minister Edwina Currie, who suspected Savile of trying to ‘blackmail’ staff after discovering some were illicitly sub-letting hospital housing and fiddling overtime.

Confidential Department of Health documents have now revealed the full extent of Savile’s influence over the Berkshire hospital.

He first became involved through the League of Friends charity in the late 1960s and was later given his own set of keys and a house in the grounds.

In 1987 he was appointed by the Government to serve on the secure unit’s board and was paid £1,230 a month.

Despite having no medical qualifications, the entertainer was referred to as ‘Dr Jimmy Savile, OBE, KCSG, LLD’ in official documents. He secured unchecked access to patients, despite concerns from staff about his behaviour.

A year later, Mrs Currie made Savile the head of a task force addressing tensions between Broadmoor’s management and unions. A memo suggests his appointment was pushed by senior civil servants, who appear to have been ‘star-struck’ by him.

It adds that Savile was going through the hospital’s main departments like a ‘dose of salts’ and that he would be instrumental in solving the row with medical staff.

‘I would say he was one hundred per cent sincere and committed in his desire to improve the management of Broadmoor and the lives of its patients,’ the memo says.

‘But I doubt he’ll let anyone stand in his way, and he clearly doesn’t mind how many people get trampled underfoot in the process.’

Panorama quoted Mrs Currie as saying Savile told her some staff were sub-letting hospital housing and fiddling overtime claims. He planned to use the information to pressure the union to end an overtime ban.

Asked if this was blackmail, Mrs Currie said: ‘That sounds like blackmail to me. I made a note of it at the time, because I was so surprised.

‘If this meant that we broke the strike and could help the patients, then we had an issue of ends justifying means.’

The scale of Savile’s offending continues to grow and Thames Valley Police said it has received a further 16 complaints against him. Broadmoor Hospital is one of dozens under NHS investigation over the scandal, including Stoke Mandeville.

Peter Watt, of the NSPCC, said: ‘There’s no doubt that Savile is one of the most, if not the most, prolific sex offender that we at the NSPCC have ever come across … somebody who at his most prolific lost no opportunity to identify vulnerable victims and abuse them.’

The West London Mental Health NHS Trust, which now runs Broadmoor, said its governance is ‘much more robust’ than at the time of Savile’s involvement.
