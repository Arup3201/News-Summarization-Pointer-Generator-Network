If Apple’s critics thought the intense fascination with the company would die down in the wake of the death of Steve Jobs, then this huge store opening will surely prove them wrong.

One of the world's largest Apple stores - covering 23,000 sq ft - is opening this week at the landmark Grand Central train station in Manhattan, New York, and will start selling to the public on Friday.

The owner of the space, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which runs the city's bus and subway system, says technology firm Apple is paying $180 per square foot for its lease.

This is slightly less than the $200-per-square-foot top rate at the century-old transport hub.

By leasing to Apple, the MTA says it is quadrupling the rent for Grand Central's east balcony and an adjacent one overlooking the cavernous main concourse with its famed night-sky ceiling.

The store includes a basement storage area that was never leased before. The transit agency says the draw of the Apple name promises to increase foot traffic to other businesses at the terminal.

Apple is behind iconic products such as the iPod, the iPad and the iPhone - and will set up in a station that is visited by about 750,000 people daily and home to the Metro-North commuter line.

Apple is making it easier than ever to spend money at the new store in Grand Central.

Visitors to the station can buy personal electronics without the help of a human being. 

They just slide an iPhone across a product's bar code and grab the item. The receipt comes by email.

'It's all about putting the customer in charge,' an Apple spokesman said.

The store also offers one feature not available at any other Apple store - 15-minute training sessions for rushed New Yorkers.

The company signed a 10-year lease with the MTA for the space once occupied by Charlie Palmer's Metrazur restaurant, which got $5million from Apple to clear out early.

MTA says the $180-per-square-foot cost reflects this $5million payment, plus Apple's $2.5million capital investment in the space and a $1.1million annual rate that will rise each year of the lease.

Apple will not share any portion of its revenue with the MTA, as other retailers do at the terminal, and it is considered by the transport group as an ‘anchor tenant’ at Grand Central.

This is equivalent to a prominent store in a shopping centre that serves as an attraction surrounded by smaller retailers. An anchor tenant typically does not share revenue.

Huge: The Grand Central Terminal Apple store, the fifth to open in New York City, is about the size of two that are in London

The spotlight on the latest Apple store accompanies the intense public profile of the company, based in Cupertino, California following the death in October of its celebrity founder, Steve Jobs.

The Grand Central Terminal Apple store, the fifth to open in New York City, is about the size of two that are in London.

Company representatives offered a media preview of the new store on Wednesday, demonstrating its key features. Apple announced the opening of the store on its retail website.

The MTA said there was nothing improper about the lease contract. Should anyone wish to examine the details, an MTA spokesman said: ‘Bring it on.’
