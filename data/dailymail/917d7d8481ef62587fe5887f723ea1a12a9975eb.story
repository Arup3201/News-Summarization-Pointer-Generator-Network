NYPD housing officer Dennis Guerra, a 38-year-old father of four died before 7 a.m. this morning at Montefiore hospital in the Bronx.

Guerra and his partner Rosa Rodriguez, 36, were the first to arrive on the combusting scene at the 18-story Unity Tower at 2007 Surf Ave in Coney Island where 'firebug' Marcello Dockery used his lighter to set a mattress on fire in the hallway of he and his mother's apartment in public housing.

Rodriguez, a single mother of four, 
is alive at the burn unit Weill Cornell Medical Center where she was 
placed in a hyperbaric chamber. She is a four year veteran of the NYPD 
Housing Bureau.

Both officers were hurt on Sunday 
when they arrived on the scene of the fire and were engulfed by layers 
of smoke and carbon monoxide.

'Can't Breathe,' Guerra said on the radio as officers heard him gasping for air.'

'He can’t breathe. He’s on the 14th floor. They’re on the 14th floor. They can’t breathe.'

'Thirteen!' Guerra said desperate for help, reports CBS.

On Monday, police arrested 16-year-old Marcell Dockery on charges of assault, arson and reckless endangerment.

Authorities said he lives in the building and set fire to a mattress that had been discarded in a hallway.

During his arrest, the suspected arsonist was seen flashing a smile for the awaiting news cameras while being led to a police cruiser.

‘We saw him smiling on TV, is this a joke? We are going through so much right now,’Guerra’s outraged mother, Miriam, told the New York Post.

The two veteran officers were overcome by smoke when they took an elevator up to the 13th floor inside an 18-story apartment complex on Surf Avenue

Dockery later revealed to detectives that boredom led him to light the mattress on fire. He was ordered held without bail.

‘I decided to take a lighter and light the top of the mattress because I was bored,’ he reportedly told police.

The teen described how he attempted to put out the flames, and when that failed, how he started knocking on neighbors’ doors to alert them to the danger, NBC New York reported.

A source told the tabloid that Dockery is a ‘firebug’ who has been bragging about his obsession with flames on his Facebook page.

Dockery has a lengthy history with the NYPD. In 2010, he was arrested for arson. His sealed record also includes criminal mischief and marijuana possession charges.  

The teen also may have been responsible for other small fires inside the Surf Avenue housing complex.

Police Commissioner William Bratton said firefighters who responded to the scene just after noon last Sunday found both officers 'unconscious and unresponsive' in the hallway on the 13th floor.

Confession: The teen described how he attempted to put out the flames before he started knocking on neighbors' doors to alert them to the fire

Emergency: Rodriguez, 36, was taken to 
Weill Cornell Medical Center, Guerra, 38, was taken to Jacobi 
Medical Center in The Bronx, before being transferred to Montefiore Medical Center

The firefighters pulled both officers back into the elevator and brought them downstairs where they were treated by EMS personnel, he said.

The mother of four was first stabilized at Lutheran Hospital and then transferred to Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. On Tuesday, a relative told the New York Daily News that she was doing 'much better' and is expected to recover.

Guerra, 38, was taken to Coney Island Hospital and then airlifted to Jacobi Medical Center.

Between them the two officers have eight children. Both officers suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and the effects of smoke inhalation.

Dockery's mother Sandra Howard is also in trouble after The Housing Authority is moving to terminate her lease, reports The New York Daily News.

Howard can either fight to stay at her home or she can sign an exclusion agreement which would forever ban her son from her own home.

Wendy Feliciano, the president of the tenants association sympathizes with the mother.

'I feel so bad for the mom,' she said. 'Let’s just hope the little boy gets help. He's 16 and he's looking at a long time in jail.'

Dockery's neighbors say that they often saw Docery 'smoking weed in the hallways,' but that he had 'a good mother who goes to church all time'

Dockery had been arrested before when he was 13 for allegedly setting a fire in school. He had other sealed arrests for minor charges as a juvenile.

He also allegedly threatened a neighbor with a razor and stole $10 out of her purse.

Mayor Bill de Blasio held a moment of silence for Guerra at an unrelated event his morning.

'We’ve lost a good man this morning,' de Blasio said.

'We had a very brave police officer Dennis Guerra who did something that most of us wouldn’t understand how to do. He went towards those in danger no matter the risk to him. It’s something that our police officers do every day, it’s something our first responders do every day, it’s something we need to appreciate every day.'
