A mother is claiming that her eight-month-old son rolled off an X-ray table while a technician went to get a cup of tea.

Chantelle Ratcliffe, 26, had taken baby Thompson Stoner for an appointment to have an X-ray on his hips.

But she says her son rolled off the bed at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, after the X-ray technician left to fetch a cup of tea.

Chantelle Ratcliffe, 26, says Thompson Stoner fell off an X-ray bed at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield while he was having an X-ray of his hips taken. He bruised and bumped his head when he fell

Ms Ratcliffe, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, said she had warned hospital staff that he was trying to crawl so was likely to roll over.

Thompson suffered bumps and bruises to his head.

Ms Ratcliffe, who was with her partner Steven Stoner and their daughter Ebonie, eight, said: ‘One of the technicians was putting a lead apron on me so I could stay with him, the other was with Thompson.

‘The next thing I heard a bang and he was on the floor, screaming.

Ms Ratcliffe says that the accident happened because the X-ray technician who was minding Thompson left him to go and get a cup of tea. She has made a formal complaint to the hospital

‘My partner and daughter were behind the X-ray screen and saw the whole thing.

‘My
partner said someone came in the room with a tray of tea and the 
technician left Thompson on the table so he could get the tea.’

She said even though the staff were apologetic, she decided to take Thompson to A&E herself as the doctor never arrived to check him over.

The hospital says that it is investigating the complaint and that it will be in touch with Ms Ratcliffe when the investigation is complete

Thompson was at the hospital to have an X-ray on his hips, as doctors were concerned he might have a problem with them when he was born.

Ms Ratcliffe is filing a formal complaint with Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Pinderfields Hospital.

Sally Napper, who is a chief nurse at the trust, said: ‘We are now investigating the complaint and will be back in touch with the family in due course.’
