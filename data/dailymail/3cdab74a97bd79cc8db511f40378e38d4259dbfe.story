Andy Murray and Roger Federer will need little reminding that the clock is ticking relentlessly on their careers.

The Wimbledon champion is turning 27 and playing in the third round of the Italian Open, while his predecessor will be back at home with his rapidly expanding family, having lost early at his main preparatory event for the French Open.

Murray has no celebratory plans, just the focus of taking on Austrian Jurgen Melzer for a place in the last eight, a match he earned with an impressive 6-2, 7-5 victory yesterday over Spain’s Marcel Granollers.

Up for the battle: Murray was in good form as he attempts to put together a decent run ahead of Wimbledon

Federer’s 
visit to the eternal city turned out to be brief, mounting a third-set 
comeback before ceding a late match point to lose 1-6, 6-3, 7-6 to 
Frenchman Jeremy Chardy.

The
 great Swiss’s career is far more advanced than Murray’s and afterwards 
he dwelt on how much a defeat can hurt him these days, especially at 
such a contented time when his twin boys have just arrived.

‘At
 this time I know how much a defeat hurts and how much it doesn’t, when 
it’s good when it hurts and when it’s not. This one is totally OK if it 
doesn’t hurt,’ he admitted.

‘I
 tried everything; you can’t do more than that on the court. Sure, it 
wasn’t fun leaving the court, walking through the corridor and thinking 
what happened out there, so maybe I was angry and disappointed and 
frustrated but then I was like: “OK, let’s just do the press conference 
and go home, let’s not waste too much more time.”’

Heading home: Roger Federer departs after losing in three sets to Frenchman Jeremy Chardy

It
 was a particularly painful reverse for Federer, 32, who led 6-5 in the 
tiebreak when Chardy pulled out a freakishly good forehand passing shot.
 Two more points and Federer was off to the airport where a private jet 
got him home for bathtime.

Murray’s
 French Open prospects will start to look a whole lot rosier if he can 
beat Melzer, a left-hander against whom he holds a 5-0 record.

Having
 fallen to a listless defeat in Madrid last week, he cut a totally different figure, calmly handling  atrociously windy conditions and 
playing smartly within himself for a creditable win against the world No
 31.

Murray
 was also unrecognisable from the player who met the same opponent a 
year ago in the same round, having to pull out at a set all with back 
problems that forced him out of Paris. He has come here without any 
specialist physio in his team. Like Federer, he was also reflective 
about the passage of time.

Relief: Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates as he comes through a tough test against France's Gilles Simon

‘Birthdays for me are not the same as when you’re 12 years old, really.  I don’t look forward to them,’  he said.

‘No
 plans. If I go home for a couple of days (before Paris) I’ll do 
something. No girlfriend or family or friends here this year...well, not
 that I know of. Maybe they’ll surprise me.’

A win for Murray over Melzer will probably see the Scot go on to face Rafael Nadal in the quarters.

The Spaniard laboured again on Wednesday night, but ultimately saw off Frenchman Gilles Simon 7-6, 6-7, 6-2.
