Just 24 hours after President Obama sat down for five-star dinner with the first lady, he was back in another renowned Hawaii restaurant for a luxury meal.

He took his family to Nobu, a Japanese restaurant inside the hip Waikiki Parc Hotel where meals cost around $180 per person. 

Images showed his motorcade parked outside the stylish eatery as hundreds crowded to get a glimpse of the Commander-in-Chief, Michelle Obama and their two children. 

The president first ate at the upmarket restaurant in 2012 on New Year's Day, enjoying a three-hour meal of butter-poached lobster, roasted duck, and seared foie gras. He has returned every year since.

The menu has cold dishes such as King Crab Ceviche and Lobster salad alongside hot options including a $45 Baby Abalone with Light Garlic Sauce and Wagyu steak at $30 per ounce.

According to Nobu's website, the restaurant is 'world renowned for its award winning innovative "New Style" Japanese cuisine.

The description adds: 'It continues to offer savvy diners across the globe a culinary adventure. Nobu Waikiki is yet another canvas for Chef Nobu Matsuhisa to display his legendary dishes, such as Black Cod Miso and Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño.

'The David Rockwell designed restaurant, is nestled in the perennially hip and centrally located Waikiki Parc Hotel. Nobu Waikiki stays true to the Nobu brand featuring décor that includes sea urchin-inspired chandeliers, and scorched ash tables in conjunction with rich hues and soft lighting to create an intimate and elegant atmosphere.'

Before his meal, on the 14th day of his Christmas vacation, Obama worked out at a gym on the Marine Corps base near his rented vacation home in the small town of Kailua outside Honolulu. 

He then signed an executive order imposing fresh sanctions on North Korea. The penalties target the North's defense industry and spy service in an attempt to punish Pyongyang for a crippling cyberattack against Sony. 

Obama's spokesman said he then called the Democrat's Senate leader Harry Reid to wish him a speedy recovery. The 75-year-old broke several ribs and facial bones on Thursday when a piece of exercise equipment snapped at his Nevada home.

The president then returned to the Marine base for a round of golf at the oceanfront Kaneohe Klipper course with Darrell Harrington and childhood friends Mike Ramos and Bobby Titcomb 

On Thursday night he visited Vintage Cave, where a 15 course, prix fixe meal costs a cool $295 a person, wine pairings add another $130 a head and the total tab often nears $1,000 after taxes and tip.

Owned by eccentric Japanese developer Takeshi Sekiguchi, also behind the Four Seasons Hualālai, the underground restaurant boasts an extensive art collection, including an 18-piece series of Picasso paintings, Les Deux Femmes.

The Obamas are currently enjoying a 17-day holiday in the president's birth state and will return to Washington, D.C. on Sunday. 

The first family kicked off the New Year with a snorkeling trip to at Hanauma Bay, a site closed to the public during the winter holidays, and then indulged on shaved ice at Island Snow, a shop near their rental home in Kailua neighborhood just outside or Honolulu.

For dinner President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama broke off from teenage daughters Sasha and Malia for a night out at exclusive restaurant Vintage Cave. 

According to the restaurant's website, 'the walls and ceilings are masoned with 150,000 antique style bricks. Its flooring is of granite quarried in the mountains of India. 

'Furniture and fixtures were all custom crafted to create unique and comfortable cavern echoing the underground architecture of ancient Rome.'

While Vintage Cave is open to the public, it also offers membership to its society that ranges in price from $50,000 to $500,000, with fees used as restaurant credit, that includes access to the restaurant's private wine cellar.

An article published this summer in the Pacific Business News named a 2009 Grand Cru Moaopole as the most expensive wine in the cellar at $16,000– likely to be a Romanee-Conti, regarded by many wine experts as the greatest burgundy. 

A single dram of a 50-year-old Macallan single-malt Scotch, available at the members-only bar, costs $6,000, it said.
