Repeat offender: The boy outside court in August

A boy of 11 given a ‘rehabilitation order’ after joining in the riots was caught shoplifting just six days later.

The boy, who is thought to be the country’s youngest rioter, stole from a department store in his home town of Romford, Essex, after the windows were smashed. 

Appearing in court on August 31, the judge told him: ‘You can’t get away with committing offences of this nature.’ 

The youngster, whose name cannot be made public, was told he would have been jailed if he was ‘a little older’.

But six days later, on September 6, he was arrested again in the town’s Asda supermarket accused of theft and assault.

Astonishingly, the boy had joined the rioting just five days after yet another court appearance, for arson and criminal damage.  

When he was placed on the youth rehabilitation order at the end of August, charities criticised the courts for punishing children of his age for ‘minor offences’.

But yesterday Tory MP for Romford Andrew Rosindell said the youngster needed a ‘short sharp shock’.

‘We need harsher penalties. You’ve got to make people fear the punishment so they don’t commit the crime,’ he added.

‘What are his parents doing to allow their child to behave in such a way? He needs to be taken away from his parents for six months.’

According to Scotland Yard, the boy is the youngest rioter in London to face prosecution.

The original Mail story on Sept 1

He admitted burglary after he was 
caught stealing a £50 waste bin from a Debenhams store on August 8, when
a gang smashed the store windows.

Appearing before Havering 
Magistrates’ Court in Essex three weeks later, District Judge John 
Woollard told him: ‘You seem to think that nobody can stop the way you 
behave.’

The boy was given an 18-month  
rehabilitation order – a generic community sentence for young offenders,
to which requirements such as curfews can be attached to try to break a
cycle of crime without resorting to custody.

But he was back in the same court on 
September 7, where he admitted theft but denied assault. He has been 
released on bail until November 22.

At the time of the riot offences, he 
was already under a ‘referral order’ for offences of arson, criminal 
damage and carrying a pointed instrument.
