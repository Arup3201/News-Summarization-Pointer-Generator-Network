The first reviews are in for Apple's £269 iPad mini, which goes on sale on Friday - and the news is good.

While some reviewers expressed disappointment at the relatively low resolution screen, in general the experts gave the gadget a thumbs up, and even believe it could outsell its bigger brother, the 9.7inch iPad.

The gadget sold out online in hours, and there are expected to be large queues for it at Apple stores on Friday as fans vie to be among the first to own the new Apple gadget.

The mini goes on sale on Friday

The iPad mini, which starts at £269 versus the £159 for Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire HD, is 
easy to hold with one hand, eliminating a drawback of the 10-inch iPad, 
Wall Street Journal columnist Walt Mossberg wrote in one of the first 
major reviews of a gadget introduced last week.

Both Mossberg and New York Times 
columnist David Pogue offered kudos for cramming most of its full-sized 
cousin's functions onto a smaller device, as advertised.

But the iPad mini's 1024 x 768 
resolution was a big step backwards from the iPad's much-touted Retina 
display, and underperformed the rival Kindle and Nexus, the two 
reviewers agreed.

Mossberg said Apple chose to go with a
lower-quality display because the existing 250,000-plus iPad 
applications could only run unmodified in two resolutions - and the 
higher level would have sapped too much power.

'The lack of true HD gives the Nexus 
and Fire HD an advantage for video fans. In my tests, video looked just 
fine, but not as good as on the regular iPad,' Mossberg wrote.

The original iPad was launched in 2010 and went on to upend the personal computer industry, spawning a raft of similar devices.

The iPad mini marks Apple's first 
foray into a smaller 7-inch segment that Amazon's Kindle Fire now 
dominates, demonstrating demand exists for such a device.

Apple, making its boldest consumer 
hardware move since Tim Cook took the helm from late co-founder Steve 
Jobs, hopes the smaller tablet can beat back incursions onto its home 
turf of consumer electronics.

Reviewers get their first look at Apple's iPad mini

'What will make some think twice about buying an iPad mini is the price. Starting at £269 for a WiFi only model, this is £100 dearer than the Kindle Fire HD or the Nexus 7, which is now available in a 16GB version for £159.

'Whether it's worth it depends on how much of a premium you put on great design and a vast ecosystem of apps. Apple will sell a lot of these little beauties, that's for sure.'

The Telegraph  - 4/5

'Looks are a matter of personal taste, but the iPad mini, I’d say, is pretty spiffy.

'Where rivals are glass and ridged plastic, Apple’s model is glass and aluminium'

The Independent - 5/5'For us, the joy of a 7-inch tablet is walking across the office or the airport, holding the slate in one hand while tapping away at it with the other.

'To consider it just a cheap, tiny iPad is a disservice.

'This is, simply, a great tablet.'

Engadget

"In shrinking the iconic iPad, Apple has
pulled off an impressive feat," Mossberg wrote. "It has managed to 
create a tablet that's notably thinner and lighter than the leading 
small competitors with 7-inch screens, while squeezing in a 
significantly roomier 7.9-inch display.

Wall Street Journal

'By pricing the Mini so high, Apple allows the $200 class of seven-inch Android tablets and readers to live.

'But the iPad Mini is a far classier, more attractive, thinner machine.'

New York Times

'If the Mini had a retina display, I’d switch from the iPad 3 in a heartbeat.

'As it stands, I’m going to switch anyway. Going non-retina is a particularly bitter pill for me, but I like the iPad Mini’s size and weight so much that I’m going to swallow it.

'My guess is that this is going to play out much like the iPod and iPod Mini back in 2004: the full-size model will continue to sell strongly, but the Mini is going to become the bestselling model.'
