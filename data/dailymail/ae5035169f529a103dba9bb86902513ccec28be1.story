A British fashion graduate has gone from rags to riches - by designing clothes for pop stars and style icons including Jessie J, Rita Ora, Cher Lloyd and Little Mix.

Alice Vandy, who still lives at home with her parents in Cornwall, only left fashion school six years ago but her eye-catching designs have already been worn by top female acts.

I’m A Celebrity star Nadia Forde and girl group Neon Jungle are also big fans of her brightly coloured prints.

The 27-year-old, who left Plymouth College of Art in 2008, got her first big break after working on designs for the Clothes Show in Birmingham.

She said: 'I always knew what I wanted to do but I didn’t expect to do it so quickly. It kind of happened by accident.

'When I graduated I just fell into doing my own brand - it was all sooner than I had planned.

'I signed up to an online portfolio site and managed to get contact details for stylist Alexis Knox.

'She got back to me and asked if I would be interested in providing some clothes for the opening scene of the Clothes Show in Birmingham.'

Her big break came when renowned stylist Alexis Knox, who has worked with Little Mix, asked Alice to provide some clothes for the opening scene of the Clothes Show in Birmingham

After being spotted at the show by several celebrities Alice was inundated with commissions - including a £300 playsuit made from a unique Amazonian print.

She also designed items to be used on X Factor and Britain’s Next Top Model and got to meet Jessie J in London.

'I went to a fitting for her,' she said. 'I worked solidly on her outfit for about five days - there were so many different pattern pieces.

'I flew up to London from Cornwall in the end. She’s so nice though - so down to earth.'

Despite her success Alice doesn’t get starstruck.

Discussing working with celebrities, she said: 'When people like Jessie J wear my clothes, all my friends go crazy, but it just becomes part of the job. 

She also designed items to be used on X Factor and Britain's Next Top Model, which she often spends days creating from scratch

'I was with my friend once and we saw a magazine with Little Mix on the front cover wearing my stuff.

'They all went crazy but I was just chilled out about it. It’s not that it isn’t exciting - it’s just all part of it.'

One of Alice’s most successful ranges is her collaboration with My Little Pony, which celebrated their 30th birthday.

It includes skin-tight leotards and dresses emblazoned with bright letters and pony prints.

'I was a huge fan of My Little Pony when I was younger. I have just painted a five-foot pony for Hasbro,' she said.

'They wanted it for a big brand licensing show and asked me to design it - they sent it down by courier and then I spent a week working on it. It was huge - 36 inches wide.'

Alice lives with her parents in their £215,000 semi-detached house in Cornwall.

Her brother, Jud, 29, is a musician and her great-grandfather, Edwin Cundiff, owned a silk mill that supplied Liberty with silks and prints.

Alice attended Cornwall College and did a national diploma in Fine Art before moving into fashion.

'I got into fashion via art instead of via textiles. It’s quite unusual but mainly because I don’t like sewing!

'I get inspired by weird things. I take so many photos of nature when I’m out and about. I have also come up with my own colour palette.

'When I was younger I didn’t have any concept of what was appropriate - I just did what I wanted. I think it’s fun to express yourself with clothing.

'I walk out of the house wearing a lime green maxi skirt and bright pink hair but I still think I look boring. I normally just do whatever I want!'

Alice is currently living in Cornwall but spends more and more time in London. Her big plans are to move to America.

'I sell most of my creations online at the moment. Now I have everything structured and in place I would love to try and hit America next year,' she said.

'Asia is also somewhere I would like to try and get a following.'

It’s not only clothes Alice is passionate about, she is also a campaigner for animal rights and loves alternative, power females such as rapper Brooke Candy.

'I use my online platform to spread awareness but I don’t preach too much or people won’t listen,' she said.

'If you get aggressive, people just won’t listen to you.'

Alice hasn’t had any loans to start her business and has worked solidly since graduating to get her name out there.

'Every day is different at the moment. I have a new range coming out soon,' she reveals.

'I’m bringing out some slightly looser clothing and bomber jackets soon. None of my clothes at the moment go above a size 14 - I am happy to custom make some stuff though if people ask for it.

'I have new partnerships launching next year and a new range with My Little Pony.

'I want to go global next year and to live in LA would be the dream.'
