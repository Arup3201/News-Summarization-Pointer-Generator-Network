Greek protesters have taken to the streets of Athens for a second successive day over the country's rescue package which might not be enough to save Greece from bankruptcy.

Angry protesters swelled into a crowd of thousands outside the Parliament buildings in Athens today, as tensions over the country's debt crisis threatened to spill over into violent clashes with police once again.

Greeks frustrated at the strict 'austerity laws' set to be approved this evening launched a 'general strike' outside Parliament which is set to last for 48 hours.

The protests had escalated yesterday into violence against police with petrol bombs and and rocks, and the demonstration turned ugly again today.

Inspectors from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have described Greece's debt dynamics as 'extremely worrying.'

Greece is said to have missed its deficit-cutting targets, while an inspectors' report added that the pace of its reforms is insufficient.

The 48-hour general strike had turned violent yesterday in Athens, and threatened to spill into clashes again today as crowds swelled

It emerged today that Athens will receive an 8 billion euro bailout loan so the country can avoid bankruptcy next month.

Greece has been relying on a 110 billion euro ($152 billion) package of rescue loans since May last year.

The inspectors' report warned, however, that a second bailout for the country tentatively agreed to on July 21 does not make its massive debts sustainable.

It was claimed yesterday that fat-cat Greeks have secretly shifted more than â‚¬228billion euros out of their country's crisis-hit banks and into accounts in Switzerland.

The big money is fleeing the country as rich Greeks fear the possible re-introduction of their old currency, the drachma, would instantly halve the value of their euros if they are left in Greek banks.

Most of the money is being transferred via Cyprus by Greek industrialists using their foreign subsidiaries to channel it out of the debt-ridden country, where tens of thousands of workers launched a general strike yesterday.

Markus Korll, from the German financial services group Roland Berger, told Bild: 'During the past few months alone more than 10billion euros has been moved abroad.'

Greek newspapers have also reported that people flying abroad - including nuns, priests and the unemployed - are being stopped at Athens airport with suitcases full of euros.

Martin Schulz, leader of the Social Democrats in the European Parliament, called for the Swiss to impose a 25 per cent tax on the money.

He said: 'In this way we can at least limit this massive flight of capital.

'People secretly moving millions out of the country can't be poor. They must pay their share.

'I can understand why the 'little people' are taking to the streets to rebel against this injustice.'

Bild says that Greek banking bosses have already warned the government about the growing panic at bank cash desks and the ever-increasing flood of capital abroad.

Government advisers are also warning of the dangers of a Northern-Rock style storm outside the banks and the need for capital controls, including disconnecting ATM machines, the paper reports.

Resentment: An estimated 50,000 protesters have converged on the centre of Athens to rally against austerity measures due to be passed tomorrow

No nonsense: Riot police stand shoulder to shoulder as they try to prevent the march of protesters

The two-day general strike which started yesterday grounded flights, disrupted public transport and shut down everything from shops to schools today - as at least 50,000 protesters converged in central Athens.

Violent clashes broke out between riot police and protesters near the Greek parliament building, with petrol bombs and rocks being thrown at officers.

All sectors, from dentists, state hospital doctors and lawyers to shop owners, tax office workers and dock workers walked off the job ahead of a parliament vote tomorrow on new austerity measures.

Ferries remained tied up in port, while public transport workers staged stoppages, although buses, trolleys and the Athens metro were expected to remain in operation.

Several thousand police deployed in the capital, blocking a road by parliament and shutting down two nearby metro stations.

Nikos Anastasopoulos, heard of a workers' union for an Athens municipality, said: 'We just can't take it any more. There is desperation, anger and bitterness.'

Demonstrations during a similar 48-hour strike in June left the centre of Athens badly damaged as rioters clashed with police.

Piles of rubbish continue to rot on street corners despite a civil mobilisation order issued yesterday to order crews back to work after a 17-day strike.

Civil servants have also staged sit-ins in government buildings, including the Finance Ministry.

The new austerity measures have been so unpopular that MPs from the governing Socialist have indicated they might vote against some of them.

But Greece must pass the bills if it is to continue receiving funds from its 110billion euro bailout.
