Police abandoned the streets to opportunistic looters during the August riots, an inquiry has concluded.

By not getting a grip at the outbreak of the violence, officers allowed the impression to take hold that the streets had been surrendered to thousands of yobs.

Disturbingly, the report added that unless police improve their response few rule out the prospect of riots in the future.

Chaos: A fire rips through a building in Tottenham, north London, during the disorder. The official inquiry into the five days of violence ¿ which cost the country at least £500million ¿ concluded the shameful scenes were not motivated by 'politics'

The official inquiry into the five days of violence – which cost the country at least £500million – concluded the shameful scenes were not motivated by ‘politics’.

Instead, the rioters’ main objectives were getting their hands on ‘luxury branded goods’ which ‘confer instant status’.

The report describes looters queuing up 
inside shops to get the best products, trying on trainers in the 
wreckage of stores and admitting their motivation was ‘greed’.

Trigger: The shooting of father-of-four Mark Duggan sparked rioting which spread across the country

The panel, established by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, concluded: ‘Rioters believed they would be able to loot and damage without being challenged by the police. In the hardest-hit areas, they were correct.’

Labour MPs had claimed the shocking scenes witnessed in August, which included 5,000 crimes and five fatalities, had been sparked by Coalition cuts.

But panel member Heather Rabbatts said: ‘These were not riots that were political, these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting and very much targeted at brands.’ 

The panel, which interviewed those who lost their homes and businesses, said the vast majority believed the ‘sole trigger’ for disturbances was the perception that the police ‘could not contain’ the scale of rioting in the capital.

Between 13,000 and 15,000 people were 'actively involved' in rioting which swept across the country between August 6 and 10.

More than 4,000 suspected rioters have been arrested with nine out of 10 already known to the police, the study said.

More than 5,000 crimes were committed - and there were five deaths.

There were 1,860 incidents of arson and criminal damage, 1,649 burglaries, 141 incidents of disorder and 366 cases of violence against the person.

The final bill could be around £500 million, with up to £300 million of claims under the Riot Damages Act and £50million on policing London.

The final bill could be around £500 million, with up to £300 million of claims under the Riot Damages Act and £50million on policing London.

Miss Rabbatts said scenes from Tottenham, North London, in which it ‘looked as if police were backing off’, led to a ‘perception that the streets were there for the taking’.

The panel members, headed by Darra Singh, have a long history of working in the public and voluntary sector. Mr Singh has worked for homeless charities and was chief executive of two local councils.

Miss Rabbatts spent time as a barrister and a BBC governor.

They were joined on the panel by Baroness Sherlock, of the Refugee Council and the National Council for One Parent Families, and Simon Marcus, who founded the Boxing Academy for teenagers at risk of gang crime.

Riots broke out in Tottenham on August 6, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan.

Unrest spread to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol.

Mr Singh said: ‘Our research has also led us to conclude that riots of this nature will happen again unless immediate action is taken.’

The Riots, Communities and Victims panel painted a devastating picture of a country in which ‘some would argue consumerism is the new religion’.

It said: ‘The desire to own goods which give the owner high status (such as branded trainers and digital gadgets) was seen as an important factor behind the riots.’

Looters repeatedly targeted the same types of shops across the country, including Footlocker, JD Sports and electrical stores.

The panel went on: ‘The ownership of 
luxury branded goods confers instant status. It is therefore perhaps not
surprising these goods became the rioters’ main objectives.’

Disorder: A hooded youth walks past a burning vehicle in Hackney on August 8. Inquiry panel member Heather Rabbatts said: 'These were not riots that were political, these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting and very much targeted at brands.'

The panel, demanding much improved planning from police in future, said: ‘The police decision to withdraw to the periphery of riot-hit areas left many communities feeling they had been abandoned.’

The panel also called for insurers, who were accused of a ‘poor response’ in some cases, to do far more to pay compensation claims promptly.

It also called for an overhaul of the 1886 Riot Damages Act, which is used to claim compensation from the state.

The panel estimated up to 15,000 were ‘actively involved’ in the riots. More than 4,000 suspected rioters have been arrested with nine out of ten already known to the police, the study said.

An Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman said the riots had presented ‘considerable challenges’ to the police.

James Slack: 'Riots were opportunistic'

The streets were still ablaze when a string of senior Labour figures took to the airwaves to blame Government ‘cuts’ for the riots.

The party’s candidate for Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, explained the initial outbreak of violence and looting by saying: ‘Tottenham’s had a  9 per cent cut nearly in its Government grant.’

Harriet Harman, as the riots spread nationwide, then pointed to the trebling in tuition fees, the axing of the Education Maintenance Allowance and the closure of local job centres.

Chris Williamson, Labour MP for Derby North, also suggested the Government’s austerity drive was to blame.

But, if Miss Harman and her colleagues were hoping yesterday’s report would validate their argument, they would have been sorely disappointed. 

The most striking rebuttal of their claim came from panel member Heather Rabbatts who explicitly said the riots were not ‘political’. 

She said that, in the case of the initial outbreak of trouble in Tottenham, the ‘catalyst’ had been the police shooting of Mark Duggan.

With reference to the way the riots then spread, she concluded: ‘These were not riots that were political, these were particularly characterised by opportunistic looting.’

The members of the panel have a long track record of working with disadvantaged groups, including teenagers at risk of social exclusion, refugees and the homeless.

It was set up after Ed Miliband called for an inquiry into the causes of the riots.

None of the panel’s recommendations for preventing further disturbances make any reference to spending cuts – which had barely begun at the time of the riots.

Where tuition fees are briefly discussed in the report, it’s in the context of some children, who live in deprived areas, saying they do not feel they will have the opportunity to get a good job or go to university.

However the panel says children in the same class as those who said they felt angry about the likes of EMA cuts had instead expressed ‘optimism and self-sufficiency’.

The report points to concerns among young black and Asian men that they are being unfairly targeted by police stop and search.

But panel chairman Darra Singh said the riots ‘were very different’ to the race riots of 1981 sparked by so-called stop and search ‘Sus laws’.

Of those offenders brought before the courts so far, 42 per cent were white, 46 per cent black and 7 per cent Asian.
