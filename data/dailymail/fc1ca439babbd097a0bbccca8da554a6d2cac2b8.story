Loca the pug whose inability to run made her an internet sensation is continuing her success with a whole series of new videos based around the adventures of her and her family.

Loca the adorable pug that can't run has notched up more than six million views on YouTube

She has so far notched up over six million views on her YouTube channel and has nearly 10,000 likes on Facebook.

The videos include, 'Can we have a rabbit?' and 'Babysitting ain't easy', as well as the original, 'The pug that couldn't run'.

Loca suffers from a brain condition called ataxia. It is a harmless brain condition but symptoms include leaning, toppling, falling and rolling over.

Loca's owner Mal Orr, 55, said: 'One day when I was watching her run I thought "That's funny - I should film it". I never thought this many people would watch it.

'We gets loads of really positive comments from people about how she makes them smile so it makes sense to keep making the films. I write and perform all the songs myself.'

Mr Orr and his wife Alena, 45, got Loca 
three years ago along with her brother, Alfie. They noticed a problem 
with Loca's co-ordination as soon as she started walking.

Mr Orr said: 'Her front legs would stay straight when she walked, so it looked like she was goose-stepping.

'The vet said it doesn't cause her any pain - it just means she can't run. The only time it annoys her is when she can't scratch an itch because she can't hit the right spot.'

The videos show Loca going on a series of adventures with her family, including going for a ride on the specially adapted motorbike that allows all four dogs to go along too.

Mr Orr said: 'A lot of people that have a disablity, or a child with a disablity, have said how great they think the videos are.

'We've had a few negative comments from people saying we're making fun of her, but we're actually trying to say it doesn't matter that she has a disability.

'Some people comment saying, 'That dog should be put down.' but they get picked up on by other people rather than us.'

There is a reality series in the pipeline starring the family and some clips aimed at the U.S. and Canada to coincide with Canada Day and the 4th of July

The new range of videos include performances from Loca's brother and sisters - Alfie, Lucy and Layla.

There is also a reality series in the pipeline and some clips aimed at the U.S. and Canada to coincide with Canada Day and the 4th of July.

Mr Orr said: 'We're aiming to get the American and Canadian videos to compete with each other for views.

'The reality show will feature Loca Cam. We're going to strap the camera to her back and see what she sees, and try and make it as funny as possible.'
