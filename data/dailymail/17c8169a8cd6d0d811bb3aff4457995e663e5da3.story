A new bar has come under fire for a string of tweets complaining about a stabbing victim spilling blood on the floor on its opening night.

The Bonneville, in Hackney, tweeted a picture of a blood stained wooden floor - and then a comment bemoaning the fact that the young man made his way into the bar after a knife attack.

The caption read: '#CSI Clapton Due to 
events on Lower Clapton Road this evening, we will unfortunately have to
 close #WelcomeToHackney'

The Bonneville, in Hackney, tweeted a picture of a blood stained wooden floor - along with a comment bemoaning the fact that a young man had made his way into the bar after a knife attack

The Bonneville then explained in an exchange with a fellow bar: 'Some kid got stabbed over the road and decided to run into ours. Great look for our first week'

Fellow bar Dreyfus Cafe replied: 'Ugh. Sounds 
horrendous. Poor kid. And definitely not what you want for your first 
Saturday evening. Sorry to hear it.'

The Bonneville then explained: 'Some kid got stabbed over the road and decided to run into ours.

'Great look for our first week.'

The tweets have been roundly critised on Twitter and Facebook, with users accusing the bar - which has opened in an area formerly nicknamed 'Murder Mile' by locals - of massive insensitivity.

One user - calling themselves How Upsetting - wrote, 'Let's parachute our "French bar/brasserie" into one of most deprived boroughs in UK. Sure none of that annoying poverty stuff will matter.'

Twitter user Jonathan Paige, added: 'Just striking the bonneville off my list of new hackney bars to visit.'

Damian 'Wildeye' O'Gorman, wrote on Facebook: 'Please have a little more thought for the community you have opened your premises in. That's someone's child. This is exactly the kind of attitude which is causing friction in the gentrification of hackney (sic).'

The bar has since issued a grovelling 
apology - which claims that bar staff were frightened and that the 
victim had been 'aggressive' - but that too has been criticised for a 
lack of sincerity.

The 
statement, issued over a series of tweets and on the restaurant's 
Facebook page, said: 'After last nights events, we would like to 
apologise profusely for the comments on twitter, which were of course 
very insensitive and have now been removed.

'At approximately 6pm on Saturday 14th June, a young man in is early 20's entered our bar. He had an injury on his upper left arm from an incident on Urswick Road.

'The staff on site immediately called the emergency services and attempted to assist him, despite him being very aggressive towards them and more interested in calling his friends to gain retribution for his injury, rather than have his wound attended to.

'The emergency services arrived and attended to him, although he was still uncooperative. The young man is in a stable condition but unfortunately is not willing to make a statement or assist the police.

'Once again, we are extremely sorry for any comments that caused offence. It was a very frightening experience for all involved and bad judgement was used in the comment.'

Rakan Budeiri replied: 'This is terrible. You really have no grasp of the situation writing this cr*p.

'Can't believe you are trying to score points.'

A Met Police spokesman said it was speaking to officers from the borough regarding the incident.
