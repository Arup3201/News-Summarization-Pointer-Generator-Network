An iconic, oversized piece of movie memorabilia has undergone an incredible transformation after more than 20 years travelling all over the Australian outback.

The almost two metre tall stiletto, famed for its appearance in celebrated Australian film Priscilla Queen of the Desert, was stolen and remained missing for around 15 years.

Finally, Horticultural designer Sue Leighton has tracked it down, rescued the hilarious high-heel from near-ruin and restored it to its former fabulous glory.

‘For those of you who remember the movie The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert there is an unforgettable scene from the movie where Guy Pearce sits in a Stiletto on top of a bus driving through the Australian Desert,’said Ms Leighton from Ravensthorpe in Western Australia.

The 1994 film follows the journey of a troop of drag performers who travel on a tour bus throughout the Australian outback.

Sue Leighton drove almost 3500 kilometres to retrieve the deserted stiletto. It is the real prop made famous in celebrated 1994 Australian film Priscilla Queen of the Desert

The almost-two-metre high stiletto was on top of the tour bus which toured the outback in the film

Sue Leighton and her friend worked tirelessly to restore the stiletto and then style it fabulously

The shoe was an unforgettable prop in the movie, but after the crew had finished filming they left the stiletto in a small town in the Northern Territory, to the delight of locals and tourists alike.

Amazingly, the stiletto’s journey was only just beginning in the movie as it has continued to travel the Australian outback for over 20 years.

‘The shoe has had a couple of lives! It was the shoe in the movie, before it was left with the Kings Canyon Resort,’ Ms Leighton told Daily Mail Australia.

For years, the shoe lived at the caravan park in the Northern Territory, almost 500 kilometres from Alice Springs.

‘The shoe was then stolen. All of a sudden it disappeared,’ said Ms Leighton.

The shoe’s location was unknown for about 15 years until it was found deserted on a track in Western Australia, around 600 kilometres from where it was last seen.

‘When it turned up, the resort didn’t want it back because it was more than 600 kilometres away,’ said Ms Leighton.

‘The shoe then spent time in an Aboriginal community who painted beautiful artwork all over it.

The stiletto has had an incredible history, travelling around Australia. It received many different decorations. Here it is pictured during its time in an indigenous community in Western Australia

'The film is brilliant and the shoe is iconic, I wanted it the second I second I heard about it' said new owner Sue Leighton

‘Then the shoe was dumped in the desert and quite badly damaged.’

After that, the shoe was adopted at Giles Weather Station on the border of Western Australia and Northern Territory.

‘It was tied up to a cage and out in the open constantly, with people climbing over it which caused lots of wear and tear,’ said Ms Leighton.

‘The local authorities tried to find it a home, but the museum didn’t want it because it would have too far to go to collect the shoe.’

However, for Ms Leighton the distance was no obstacle.

‘From the minute I heard about it, I knew I wanted it.’

‘I knew about it so I tracked down the shoe and made some enquiries.’

‘I was so interested because it was an epic film and such an iconic movie!’

‘The shoe intrigued me and when I knew I was bringing it home I was so excited.’

Ms Leighton and her partner Colin Hughes drove over 3500 kilometres to pick her the shoe in the back of a trailer.

The shoe has been decorated with crocheted flowers from the local community in WA town, Ravensthorpe

The shoe even did a stint in Broadway before returning to the red, dusty roads of the outback

Much like the film, Ms Leighton enjoyed their adventure immensely.

‘It was a beautiful trip, it was great to get out in the outback. You learn so much about your beautiful backyard.’

‘Although our trailer’s not quite as fancy as the tour bus in the film!’ joked Ms Leighton.

The resident of Ravensthorpe, a town six hours from Perth, organised a welcome party for the shoe in the little town.

‘I thought there might be 50 or 60 but hundreds turned out, all decked out and looking colourful. Which of course was very appropriate for a stiletto from Priscilla,’ she said.

‘Her first stop in town was to the Hopetoun Jetty where fans greeted her at sunset and welcomed her with open arms,’ said Ms Leighton.

The shoe is thrilled to live in her beautiful new town, according to Ms Leighton

‘Recently she (the stiletto) has been spotted swanning amongst the canola crops and checking out Wildflowers taking in all the colours of the area,’ laughed Ms Leighton.

There was a lot of work to be done but for Ms Leighton it was a labour of love which she look to with lavish.

‘It’s a big, big shoe so it’s been a big project,’ said Ms Leighton.

‘My friend and I spent two weekends solid fixing it. It had cracks all through it so we needed to re-fibreglass the shoe.

A keen participant in the community’s Art Council Projects, the stiletto’s first styling is inspired by the communities beautiful wildflowers.

The shoe has been decorated in crocheted flowers that were created by the community.

Ms Leighton’s creative mind is filled with ideas for how she can next decorate the heel.

‘I would like to give a signature to the shoe. It will be some sort of recognition to the aboriginal community who had it for some time,’ said Ms Leighton

‘I’d also like to see it painted scarlet red and gold.

‘We’re renowned for fishing in town so we could paint it like shark skin.’

After seeing the shoe in person, she has had one major observation.

‘Guy Pearce would have had real trouble sitting in that shoe for that famous scene, I imagine!’
