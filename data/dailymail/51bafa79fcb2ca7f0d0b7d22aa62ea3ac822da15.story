A group of car parks are offering drivers the chance to pay for their spaces with conkers instead of cash.

Customers will be allowed to hand over the horse chestnut tree seeds at a rate of 20 pence each and can buy between five and six minutes of parking. 

Staff at the car parks in Leeds and Manchester have started the scheme in a bid to help the environment, and bring back childhood memories.

Exchange: A customer at the Merrion Centre in Leeds pays for his parking using conkers

Bargain: Each in-tact conker is worth 20 pence, and customers can use up to 50 when paying for their parking

Experiment: The exterior of the Merrion Centre car park in Leeds where staff are accepting conkers in exchange for spaces

Each collected seed will then be used to sponsor a forest in the UK to help offset rising levels of emissions from vehicles.

A maximum of 50 conkers worth £10 can be used at the Merrion Centre and Clarence Dock car parks, in Leeds, West Yorkshire, as well as the Tariff Street car park, in Manchester.

At the Merrion Centre, customers are charged £2.20 for an hour, which is the same as 11 conkers, while drivers using the Clarence Dock car park are only required to hand over 10 conkers at a rate of £2.00 an hour.

The Tariff Street car park in Manchester is £3.00, or 15 conkers, for two hours and £4.00 or 20 conkers for three hours.

Ben Ziff, Managing Director of Town Centre Car Parks, who are running the scheme, said: 'Car emissions are on the rise throughout the country.

'We thought it would be a fun idea to raise awareness and give a little bit back.

'We all have fond memories of looking for conkers so this seemed like a great idea for our customers. We are looking forward to seeing how many people bring us'.

The unique promotion will run until September 22 as Autumn begins and conker season reaches fever pitch.

Charity: The seeds from the horse chestnut trees will then be used to sponsor a forest to help offset the rising levels of emissions from cars

Company: The scheme is being run by Town Centre Car Parks which operates the Merrion Centre along with the Clarence Docks car park in Leeds and the Tariff Street car park in Manchester
