It is perhaps what John Lennon was referring to when he sang to his ‘little flower princess’.

Women in Liverpool are the most pungent in Britain when it comes to dousing themselves in floral perfumes, a study has found.

Those in the south prefer a more delicate fruity fragrance, while Mancunians give off a sharp citrusy odour.

The findings have emerged as part of a ‘fragrance map of the UK’, compiled by comparing figures for sales of different kinds of perfumes across the country.

The results suggest that lifestyle and surroundings have a marked impact on what women choose to smell like.

In Merseyside, floral scents are far more popular than across the rest of the UK.

Inspired by local WAGs including Coleen Rooney, women in Liverpool buy 66 per cent more of the fragrance than those elsewhere.

They also use more of the stuff, with department store bosses saying their ‘high maintenance’ Liverpudlian clientele ‘don’t simply spritz on their perfume, but rather immerse themselves in their chosen scent’.

Sales of scented body lotion and shower gel are also very high and coffrets sell at a rate of 31 per cent more in the region compared to the national average.

Geordie lasses, meanwhile, spend the most in total on fragrances, with an average transaction for perfumes in the North East coming in at £50.

Visitors to the region are most likely to leave with a lingering whiff of woody scents.

Sales of fragrances such as sandalwood and cedarwood are 14 per cent higher in Newcastle, researchers found.

By the mouth of the coast in South Wales, girls appear to enjoy smelling like their surroundings, with aqua scents flying off the shelves in Cardiff almost 90 per cent more frequently than across the rest of the UK.

Those in the east Midlands also take their geography seriously, with oriental scents more popular in Nottingham than elsewhere.

Mancunians, meanwhile, favour citrusy smells, while women in London buck the trend and go for rural fruity scents.

Sales of fruity fragrances in the capital are 70 per cent higher than in all the other cities studied.Researchers also found women are increasingly switching perfumes during the day - from light day scents to a more dramatic fragrance for evening.

The fragrance map of the UK was compiled using sales figures from John Lewis.

Amanda Scott, head of beauty at the department store, said: ‘It is fascinating to see how lifestyle and surroundings affect customers’ fragrance choices.

‘Women wear a scent like they wear a statement necklace in the evening - to stand out and be original.’
