Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer has revealed his first ever experience of St James' Park was enough to convince him his future lay in professional football.

Shearer scored 206 times in 404 appearances for the club, but it was a Kevin Keegan effort against Queens Park Rangers that first ignited his love of the game.

'I remember my first game like it was yesterday,' said Shearer. 'It was August 1982 and Newcastle were facing Queens Park Rangers.We took the metro and got there especially early to soak up the atmosphere, I bought a scarf on the way and couldn’t believe my dad when he told me he’d kept it to this day. 

Alan Shearer revealed the first game he ever went to at St James' Park was a 1-0 win over QPR in 1982

After joining in 1996, Shearer scored 206 times in 404 appearances for the club

'I’ll never forget the feeling of entering the Gallowgate, I couldn’t really see much of the game, but when we scored I got lifted in the air and felt total adulation. 

'The atmosphere was unbelievable, we won 1-0 and I’d never felt anything like it before.'

'Seeing us win on my first game was special, but what made it even better was Kevin Keegan making his debut that day and scoring the winning goal. Seeing him run over to us with his arms held aloft was pure ecstasy, it was then that I knew I had to become a professional footballer.

Keegan, right, was instrumental in bringing Shearer to Newcastle in 1996

He added: 'The story continued when I was a ball boy at his final match for Newcastle, before he eventually signed me in 1996 and gave me the chance to represent my boyhood club and live out the best years of my career. I’ll always appreciate his role in helping me get to where I am today.'

And now Premier League sponsors Barclays have launched a new initiative to ensure that other young supporters get their chance to fall in love with the game.

The scheme will give away thousands of Premier League tickets to fans over the remainder of the 2014-15 season.

Shearer said: 'The fact that Barclays are giving more and more young people the chance to experience football for the first time can only benefit the game for the future.'
