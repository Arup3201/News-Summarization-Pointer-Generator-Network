The Washington Post is ending 80 years of being led by the Graham family with the departure of Publisher Katharine Weymouth.

The newspaper said Tuesday that Weymouth, the granddaughter of longtime Washington Post Co. CEO Katharine Graham, is stepping down. She will be replaced by Frederick Ryan, who previously ran the political website and newspaper Politico.

Weymouth announced Tuesday that she will leave the Post after serving for 17 years in various roles. She has been publisher for seven years.

'This is just the beginning of a wonderful new chapter for The Post,' she said in a statement.

She also described her successor as 'a seasoned and well-respected executive with a track record of success at the helm of Politico and Allbritton Communications. He knows Washington, and he knows media. Fred is excited to take the helm and to meet all of you.'

Weymer's statement said Ryan will become publisher October 1, though she revealed 'I will remain available as an advisor to him and to The Post through the end of the year.' 

The change follows the sale of the publication last year to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos for $250 million. On Tuesday, Bezos announced the appointment of Ryan as the new publisher.

Ryan had served as president and CEO of Politico since its inception in 2007. In the 1980s, Ryan was chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan.

In a statement, Ryan called The Post a 'crown jewel' of journalistic values.

The Washington Post reported that Ryan, while speaking to the paper's newsroom, only said of his new job 'I decided I’m not going to get into the play-by-play. But I will say, I’ve known Jeff for a while. He is passionate about The Post and about journalism and about the premier role The Post has played and can play going forward.

'And we had a lot of exciting conversations about opportunities that are available in media today, challenges of course, innovative ways forward. And I was honored that he selected me to take on this role. 

'[Ryan] has never asked us to do or not do a story,' Bill Lord, Ryan's colleague at Albritton Communications, told The Post. 'He’s never tried to influence the news one way or another.' 

Politico, which is based in Arlington, Va., was launched by two former Washington Post reporters, John Harris and Jim VandeHei, in January 2007. It is known for hard-hitting, sometimes irreverent reporting on campaigns, rhetoric and scandal, and is one of The Washington Post's strongest competitors.

Weymouth's great-grandfather, Eugene Meyer, bought the Post at a bankruptcy auction in 1933. Meyer's daughter, Katharine Graham, oversaw the paper through some of its most important stories, including the Watergate scandal.
