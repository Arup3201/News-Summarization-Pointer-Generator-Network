Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman may not be cradling a Super Bowl trophy but on Thursday his girlfriend gave birth to the greatest prize of their lives-a baby boy.

Oddly enough the baby, named Rayden, was born on February 5, written 2/5, and Sherman wears number 25 for the Seahawks.

Sherman and his girlfriend, Ashley Moss, weren't expecting the baby to arrive until February 12 but the slightly early birth was a welcomed surprise and an amazing coincidence, reports The Seattle Times.

Lucky number: Richard Sherman who wears No. 25 on his jersey's girlfriend Ashley Moss gave birth to his son on 2/5, days before the baby's expected February 12

What a gift!: Richard Sherman and his girlfriend Ashley Moss welcomed their son Rayden into the world this morning and are celebrating his birth 

'My son sure does know how to make an entrance! 2/5/15… Is it a coincidence or is he just that clever?! Either way I’m ecstatic,' Sherman tweeted early on Thursday.

There was some talk about the possibility of Moss giving birth on Super Bowl Sunday in which case Sherman would have missed the game.

Luckily for the family the baby came just at the right time.

Sherman's coach Pete Carroll tweeted last week, 'can't wait to see little Petey.' 

Even though Sherman didn't name his child after the coach, perhaps Carroll will be pleased about Rayden's fortuitous birth date.

The birth is a beacon of light after the Seahawk's crushing loss 24-28 loss to the Patriots on Super Bowl Sunday.

Sports Illustrated reporter Peter King was the one to first report the baby's name on Twitter today. Perhaps Rayden will appear in Sports Illustrated someday should he choose to follow in his father's footsteps.
