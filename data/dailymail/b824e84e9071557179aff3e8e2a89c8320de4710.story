Former 
England players Ashley Cole, Peter Crouch and Shaun Wright-Phillips have all been spotted by the pool in Los Angeles as Roy Hodgson's men prepare for the World Cup.

The
 trio were seen along with Crouch's wife Abbey Clancy, 
only Cole had a chance of making Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad.

Cole, 33,
 was believed to be very close to being on the plane to Brazil but 
eventually Southampton teenager Luke Shaw was chosen to go ahead of him.

Pool: Footballers Ashley Cole (right) and Shaun Wright-Phillips (second right) were also seen relaxing by the pool

Sun: Clancy seemed to be enjoying herself by the pool in Los Angeles

Crouch, 32 now plays for Stoke City whilst Wright-Phillips plays for QPR, neither has featured for England since 2010.

Wright-Phillips enjoyed success this 
season with QPR as they secured promotion back to the Premier League 
although his future remains unclear.

Crouch has become an important player at Stoke City and enjoyed a productive season, finishing as their top scorer in the Premier League with eight goals.

Going in the right direction: Cole seemed to be enjoying himself while sunbathing

Friends: Crouch (left) and Cole (bottom) were both relaxing by the pool ahead of the World Cup

Blonde star: The 28-year-old presenter and model was spotted striking a number of sultry poses in a teeny tasseled bikini, which failed to get much of Peter's attention

Carlos Tevez has also been sighted in America with the former Manchester City striker dpomg little to suggest that he has come to terms with his exclusion from Argentina's World Cup squad whilst on holiday in Miami.

The Juventus forward was spotted last week at Miami Beach and his mood doesn't appear to have improved as he remains on holiday.

Tevez, 30, looked to be in a despondent mood as he chatted to his wife by the ocean.

Pensive: Carlos Tevez looked thoughtful and sombre whilst on holiday in Miami with his wife Vanessa

Crucial: Tevez has proved to be a vital part of Juventus' team this season

Cosy: The pair looked every inch a loved-up couple as Vanessa nestled her head into the footballer's chest and he placed his chin lovingly on top of her head

Juventus won Serie A in emphatic fashion this season and Tevez played a big role in their success, scoring 19 goals in Serie A.

Tevez was the highest profile exclusion from Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella's squad for the World Cup but it came as no shock with Tevez's last international game coming in 2011.

That match was in the Copa America and Sabella was hired after Argentina's exit in that tournament, meaning Tevez is yet to play for Sabella.

Topping up his tan: The pair were also seen chatting to each other as Carlos enjoyed a refreshing beverage

Efficient: Tevez (centre) settled well in Italy, scoring 19 goals in his debut season in Serie A

Sunning himself: The footballer has been at Miami Beach trying to get over his exclusion from Argentina's World Cup squad in the best way possible - by sunning himself with his wife

Speaking earlier this year about his international exile Tevez said 'I don't know if it's a political choice. I think it all depends on Sabella.'

Argentina will be going to the World Cup with attacking options such as Sergio Aguero, Lionel Messi, Gonzalo Higuain and Ezequiel Lavezzi so it is unlikely that Tevez will be missed.Â
