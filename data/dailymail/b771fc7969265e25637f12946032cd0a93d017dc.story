Prince Charles has suffered more injuries on the polo field than former boxing world champion Amir Khan has sustained in the ring, it has emerged.

The Prince of Wales and world-famous boxer swapped tales of their sporting wounds at a recent public event in Sunderland, and discovered that the royal had in fact sustained more injuries than the ex-world light welterweight champion.

Prince Charles and Khan were both in the north-east to support a National Citizen Service (NCS) project which enables youngsters to help older people learn about social media.

Olympic silver medallist Khan said the prince had told him he was a boxing fan which led to them discussing the injuries suffered through the love of their hobbies.

Prince Charles, 66, was once a keen polo player and badly broke his right arm in 1990, before being knocked unconscious in a charity match in 2001. 

He also fractured his shoulder in 2001, broke a rib in 1998 and had six stitches in his left cheek after being kicked by a pony at Windsor in 1980.

Meanwhile, Khan, 28, from Bolton, has won 30 of his 33 fights and escaped serious injury in a career which has seen him earn millions.

During their meeting, Khan showed the prince a tweet he was sending to his 1.5 million followers across the world about the royal visit. 

The tweet said: 'Great day with The Prince of Wales seeing the great work @NCS grads are doing #OurFuture #Iwill.' 

Afterwards, the boxing champion said: 'He is a very nice guy.

'I have met him two or three times before and he seems like a boxing fan.

'We had a bit of a chat about boxing and we had a chat about his polo and how many injuries we'd had.

'He'd had more injuries in that than I have in boxing. It shows you can get injured in all sports.'

During the event at Sunderland's Bethany City Church, Olympic silver medallist Khan told the congregation that he had focused on his sport to succeed.

He said schemes such as the NCS, which involves 15-17-year-olds volunteering to help their community, could help others to find their focus.

Martha Armstrong, 63, who lives in a complex for retired people in the city centre, said she managed to get introduced to the royal at the meet and greet.

She said afterwards: 'We talked about grandchildren, tablets and technology.

'I cannot describe the experience I had - I didn't think I would be introduced to him.'

Prince Charles is currently on a tour of the northern city and has visited a car plant as well as local schools

Earlier, the prince visited Britain's most productive car plant and saw Nissan Leaf electric cars roll off the line.

The plant in Sunderland is the UK's only mass market electric car manufacturer, and it employs 6,700 making a range of models for the Japanese giant.

The prince is known for his concern over green issues and fans of electric vehicles say powering them from the grid is 60% cleaner than using conventionally fuelled vehicles.

He spoke to children from Gillis Lane Primary School and the Venerable Bede Academy, both in Sunderland, and St Cuthbert's Catholic High School in Newcastle, as well as Nissan apprentices at the plant's Skills Academy.

He is a proponent of getting young people involved with industry to boost their employment opportunities and bridge the skills gap.
