Liverpool midfielder Philippe Coutinho believes securing FA Cup silverware would save their season, with hopes of a top four finish looking increasingly unlikely.

The Reds go into their FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn on Wednesday night off the back of damaging league losses at home to Manchester United in March followed by a 4-1 thumping at the hands of Arsenal on Saturday.

Defeat at the Emirates means fifth-placed Liverpool trail fourth spot, currently occupied by Manchester City, by seven points with seven games remaining.

After the match, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers conceded defeat in his quest for the top four. 

And while Coutinho refuses to give up hope of qualifying for Europe's elite club competition for a second consecutive season, he does admit that ending the campaign with silverware would be some consolation if that was the case.

'Winning the [FA] cup would save our season. It is very important for us to have that as an objective,' Coutinho told the club's official website.

'We have to pick ourselves up after what happened against Arsenal to get the results that we need. We want to be in the Champions League. That is our primary objective. We have seven games left and we have to see what happens.'

'Arsenal played very well, as they always do, and we did not do the things we have to do to win, the things we have done in previous games, like pressing the ball well.

'That was the difference between the two sides. It was a very difficult game but we have to pick our heads up and keep believing. We have to keep going. We have more games to come and lots of things can still happen.'
