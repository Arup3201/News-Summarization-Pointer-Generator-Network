The main railway line from London to Cornwall will re-open within weeks after millions of pounds were spent rebuilding a section of track which swept into the sea.

Three hundred engineers have used 5,000 tonnes of concrete, 150 tonnes of steel, scaffolding bridges and long stretches of cable to repair the track in the Devon town of Dawlish, which bore the brunt of the fierce storms which battered Britain last month.

Photos show dramatic progress on the 100m stretch of track, where workmen have had to build a new sea wall, lay new track and demolish and rebuild an entire platform at Dawlish station after a storm surge left the railway dangling over the sea.

Mammoth project: The cost of rebuilding the railway line through the Devon town of Dawlish is thought to be around £15m after it was swept into the sea

Hard at work: More than 300 engineers have been tasked to work on the two-month project, using more than 5,000 tonnes of concrete and 150 tonnes of steel

Then and now: Left, the section of track which was left dangling over the sea on February 5 in stormy weather; right, workers in the sunshine as the repairs move on

Devastated: How the worst-affected section of track looked on February 6. The collapse destroyed part of a house which was perched on the seafront near the line

Repairs: The same area on February 27 after workers made a temporary sea wall using shipping containers full of stones and poured concrete into the gap

Rail chiefs hoped to re-open the line this month, but had to put the date back to mid-April as the project slipped behind schedule. Now, however, they have brought the date forward two weeks and say it will re-open on April 4.

It will be welcome news to the thousands of commuters who will have been stranded on replacement buses and coaches for two months.

Immediately after the track collapsed some passengers were forced to pay double because the rail firm which runs services on the line withdrew all its advance tickets, which come at a heavy discount.

Amid a fierce backlash, First Great Western was forced to deny 'profiteering' and the next day introduced a 25 per cent discount for all its more expensive on-the-day fares.

Despite the gesture traders in Devon and Cornwall have claimed the works have cost the South West's tourist economy more than £1million a day.

Battering: Waves smash against the seafront in Dawlish on the morning after a storm surge washed away the sea wall under a 100m stretch of railway track

Mess: Workers arrived soon after the track was left dangling in mid-air, but had to continue battling storms which damaged the sea wall for more than a week afterwards

Damage: While the hole in the sea wall was the biggest in Dawlish, several other parts of the historic railway designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel were damaged

The repair work is reportedly costing £15million but Network Rail has refused to confirm its estimate for the final cost of the project. A spokesman told MailOnline only that it would run into 'millions of pounds'.

The spokesman said: 'Network Rail is acutely aware of the value of the railway to the economy of the south west of England and has been working closely with local authorities, business groups and transport providers in and around Dawlish to ensure that disruption is minimised.

'Restoring this vital asset in time for the busy school holiday period will provide a welcome boost to the regional economy as business and tourism return to South Devon and Cornwall.'

Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin added: 'I saw for myself the scale of the damage to the line at Dawlish caused by the recent exceptionally bad weather. Today’s confirmation that the line should now be back in operation before the Easter holidays will be a real boost for local communities and businesses.

'I know that Network Rail staff have been working tirelessly to get the line up and running as soon as possible. I would like to thank everyone for their hard work so far.'

Spray: The storms continued for more than a week after the collapse but workers were already on site, as shown in this photo from February 9

Sea view: Network Rail released a series of photos showing how work has progressed on the site of the disaster. This one is dated February 12

Romantic walk on the beach: Works continued on February 14, Valentine's Day, when this photo was taken. Huge shipping containers formed a temporary wall

Damage: Work continues on February 19. The project is costing an estimated £15m and more repairs will be needed to secure the sea wall in the future

Just keep digging: Workers on the seafront on February 26. The route is more than 150 years old and was opened as a channel from London to the south west

Progress: This photo, also taken on February 26, shows how work on the sea wall has progressed since much of it was swept away

Landslips: Workers on the line on March 5. Several landslips in more than a week of storms pushed the work behind schedule amid protests from Cornwall businesses

More work will have to be done on the line to safeguard it against future storms once the railway has been reopened, with the final cost yet to be confirmed.

The Army and Royal Marines were called in to help with emergency repairs after the track gave way on the night of February 4. It had already been closed for safety reasons after heavy waves and a storm surge were predicted.

More than a week of storms badly damaged a 3.7 mile section between Dawlish and Teignmouth - with other breaches at Dawlish Warren and Teignmouth and five landslips near the famous Smugglers’ Cove.

The route is more than 150 years old, and 
was designed by the engineering legend Isambard Kingdom Brunel to take 
tourists to the south west from London.

Sunny at last: Workers in Dawlish have finally been able to bask in warm weather, which has helped push the re-opening of the line ahead of schedule

Tuesday 4 February

Forecasts warn of six-metre waves and at 3.15pm the line through Dawlish is closed to trains, with staff withdrawn to 'safe locations'. The storm continues through Wednesday as engineers arrive on site to begin repairs.

Thursday 6 February

Work begins on demolishing what is left of the battered railway. Rails and sleepers spanning the hole in the sea wall are cut off and removed. A ramp into the hole is constructed for access.

Sunday 9 February

A row of shipping containers is put in place and filled with rubble to provide a breakwater for the workmen, who spray quick-drying concrete on sections that need urgent repairing between each high tide.

Wednesday 12 February

Workers create scaffolding and a cable bridge to access parts of the site which have been cut off.

Friday 14 February

Another sea surge swamps the Dawlish cost during the night, damaging the 10-tonne shipping containers forming the temporary sea wall. Further sections of the old sea wall are destroyed - making the hole a third bigger - and another section of the wall breaks away near Dawlish Warren.

Wednesday 26 February

The storms have finally blown over. Track begins to be built for the area near Dawlish station as the platform is rebuilt and some of the 5,000 tonnes of concrete continue to set into a new sea wall.

Thursday 27 February

Rail bosses announce they have finished filling the hole with concrete.

Monday 10 March

The new platform nears completion as new sleepers are installed between Dawlish Warren and the main hole. Within days workers start the process of laying new tracks at the site.
