Age shall not weary Roger Federer nor the years condemn, but still the veteran Swiss master could not summon up enough to break the spirit of Novak Djokovic.

Turning 33 next month and now the father of four, the extraordinary Federer somehow managed to  turn Sunday’s Wimbledon final into a marathon and gave himself a fleeting sight of victory that  may have become a reality against anyone else.

Saving a match point in the fourth set and spurning a break point in the decider, he made a nonsense  of the 2013 final — won by Andy Murray, of course — being the most  difficult act to follow.

Federer came so close to providing something equally poignant but the difference this time was that the Centre Court, replete with a full quorum of A-listers, did not get the winner it wanted as Djokovic finally prevailed 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 in just under four hours. It might be unfair to cast the 27-year-old Serb as some Blackheart figure, but again he will have felt almost friendless, faced this time with the ageing hero rather than his British contemporary trying to make history.

The one-sided nature of the crowd was a
 disadvantage but his most potent opponent other than the man across the
 net was the demon left inside him from so many recent Grand Slam final 
defeats.

Five times in his last six 
championship matches he had been beaten, usually from promising 
positions, and that gnawed away as he desperately tried to close out a 
rampaging Federer in the fourth.

Federer was playing a different game, 
and not just how he sought to attack the net in a way that will have had
 many of the watching champions such as Rod Laver purring.

For Federer this was about adding to 
his 17 major titles and achieving a historic eighth at Wimbledon. He was
 playing for his legacy and  the chance to put distance between his 
personal tally and that of the chasing Rafael Nadal, who is on 14. 
Achievements already banked can mean less pressure, yet he also aware 
that time is running short. Who knows, we may look back on this as when 
time ran out, for he will be close to 34 when he returns next year.

If so, his last appearance in a  final
 at SW19 will leave the hazy memory of someone who matched effortless 
style with a competitive spirit so evident in a fourth set of  mesmeric 
theatre.

The third-set tiebreak had been an 
exemplar of why Wimbledon 2012 is the only Grand Slam that Federer has 
won in the last four and a half years.

Faced with the warrior spirits of 
Nadal, Djokovic and (sometimes) Murray, he had again flinched when it 
most matters. This is what happens with the onset of age and perhaps, 
the statistics suggest, the burden of parental responsibility.

It was there in his hesitant approach 
to the net at 2-3, or the edgy forehand error at 3-5, the  marginal lack
 of conviction that does not afflict his younger rivals  as much.

And it was there at the start of the 
fourth set when Djokovic took advantage of his heavy-legged  positioning
 to break for 3-1, as the crowd resigned itself to consoling their idol 
and being back in the bar for Pimm’s o’clock.

Federer’s comeback for 2-3 was a false
 start as he was broken again, but from 2-5 down he extracted one 
throaty roar after another from the Centre Court crowd as he reeled off 
five games with a combination of groundstroke winners and finely judged 
forays to the net.

Djokovic loves a target at the net and
 passed him repeatedly, but Federer would not be daunted as he preyed on
 the doubts that he knew would float to the surface for an increasingly 
agitated opponent, who was demanding more respect from a reluctant 
assembly.

At 4-5 down Federer saw off  
Djokovic’s first match point with one of the 29 aces he sent down during
 the course of the afternoon.

The line judge’s naked eye disallowed 
it and ironically it was HawkEye, an innovation the Swiss has so often 
sniffed at, that was needed to confirm its authenticity. When Djokovic 
sent a forehand long to concede the set, what would have been arguably 
the greatest Federer victory of all, given his creeping years, looked 
on.

In the last of their three Wimbledon 
finals, respective coaches Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg played a 
five-setter and here was another, with Federer starting it looking much 
the fresher. Djokovic needed to summon the physio to rub a sore calf 
muscle after the third game and at 3-3, 30-40 came Federer’s chance when
 he got the serve back but was forced deep and wide on to his backhand 
and could only float the ball into the net.

Djokovic’s return of serve, a shot he 
has improved to the point of being the all-time master, so nearly 
brought him the next game but the seven-times champion three-times saved
 himself. Only at 5-4 did  the pressure tell sufficiently for Djokovic 
to gain the winning break of serve, with anti-climactic ease.

The vanquished had put on a  fabulous 
show but it was Djokovic, now restored to the world No 1 spot, on his 
way to the Champions’ Dinner last night at the Royal Opera House. One 
day people might come to love him like they do Federer  — but they both 
know love does not win you titles.

FIRST SET: 7-6 (9-7) Federer – both players produce their best tennis throughout, with no break points on offer. A trademark ace helps the seven-time champion to the tie-break win.

SECOND SET: 6-4 Djokovic – The Serb breaks Federer early on and never looks back, with only two unforced errors in the whole set.

THIRD SET: 7-6 (7-4) Djokovic – Again neck and neck with no breaks, but this time Novak dominates the tie-break.

FOURTH SET: 7-5 Federer – The most thrilling set in the match by far, with five breaks of serve. Djokovi leads 5-2 but throws it all away, missing  championship point in the process. Federer wins five games in a row to send it into a decider.

FIFTH SET: 6-4 Djokovic – Both men on their last legs but the 27-year-old finds some of his best tennis when it matters most. A few unforced errors from Federer help Djokovic break him for the championship.
