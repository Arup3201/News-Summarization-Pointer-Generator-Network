Alpine tourist meccas which attract thousands of British tourist every year are among the most polluted in France, new research reveals.

It shows that Annecy, the beautiful waterside town surrounded by ski slopes, has the second worst air quality in the whole of France.

Despite claiming to have ‘Europe’s cleanest lake’, the World Health Organisation (WHO) survey shows its air is full of dangerous fine particles.

Annemasse, another French town surrounded by dramatic mountainous countryside on the Swiss border, is similarly blighted.

The WHO researchers looked at pollution levels in nearly 1,600 cities in 91 countries for the years 2008-2013.

Annecy, which is second on the ‘most polluted air’ list for France, has an average 25 microgrammes of so called PM 2.5s - the most dangerous fine particles.

They pose a particularly dangerous risk to anyone with breathing conditions including asthma, but also adversely affect everybody else.

The reason for the high level of pollution is the cold, dry, Alpine air which traps pollution close to the ground, and stop it being carried away by the wind.

However the region is still far behind Delhi, the most polluted city on Earth, which has six times more harmful particles in the air than European cities

The urban sprawl of Geneva is close to Annecy, and there is always masses of traffic carrying people and goods up to the Alpine towns and villages.

The most polluted French city on the list was Douai, in northern France, which had 26 microgrammes of fine, harmful particles per units of air.

Delhi, the most polluted city in the world, had 153 micrograms per cubic metre of the most harmful particles - making it some six times more polluted than the worst cities in Europe.
