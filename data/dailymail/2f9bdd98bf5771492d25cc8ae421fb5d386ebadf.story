A frostbitten stray kitten has undergone surgery to have a section of her 'dead' tail removed.

The ten-week-old feline nicknamed Popsicle was found by construction workers in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 17 as temperatures dipped below freezing.

Vets at the Nebraska Humane Society found she was suffering from severe frostbite on  her back feet and tail, causing her to hobble along in pain.

She was swiftly put on medication to help relieve the discomfort and re-homed in a warm kennel.

Staff were unable to save Popsicle's tail and she has been having hydrotherapy treatment twice a day on her paws to help them heal.

This involves warm water being run over both feet in a bid to stimulate blood flow  and remove dead tissue.

One paw responded well initially but the other was less responsive to treatment

Popsicle will be offered up for adoption when she is given the all clear. 

It is hoped she will be fully-healed in a few weeks. 

The Nebraska Humane Society says Popsicle's story 'serves as a stark reminder of how cold weather and lack of shelter can adversely affect our pets.'
