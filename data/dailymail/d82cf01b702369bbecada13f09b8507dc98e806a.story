This could be one of the most challenging reads of all time.

Named The Smallest Book in the World, its teeny-tiny size requires a magnifying glass to see the text and tweezers to turn each page.

This 62-year-old book, which measures 3.5mm by 3.5mm - smaller than a 5 cent coin, has traveled far and wide from Germany to Australia since its creation in 1952. Now the diminutive book is on display in a protective glass cabinet until Sunday.

Anna Clark, store manager of at Slado's Recycled Books, said the bookÂ was made by the Gutenberg Shop to raise funds for its museum in Mainz, Germany but is currently owned by a local collector in Bathurst, 200km west of Sydney.

The handmade book is letter-press printed, thread sewn, bound in black leather and emblazoned with a gold cross on the front cover and gold blocking.

It contains the Lord's Prayer which is written in seven languages: American and British English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish and Swedish. Each page has been printed using type with a shank less than half a centimetre in length.

But while this book's title may not be an accurate claim as the Teeny Ted from Turnip Town which measures 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres currently holds the Guinness World Record, its originator still produces variations of the historic artifact.

The Gutenberg Museum, one of the oldest printing museums in the world, has a shop which still stocks versions of the little rarity. They include a limited edition red leather bound book with a gold heart containing 'I love you' in nine languages and another which has the Olympic oath in eight languages.

They also sell miniature literature, poetry, fairy tales and even erotica.

When asked how many pages the book has, Ms Clark said she was unsure as she wouldn't dare handle the rare piece of artwork.

'You need a magnifying glass to read the text and tweezers to turn the pages,' she said.

'So I don't want to play with it. It's quite delicate and fragile.

'We have it on display so people can take a look at the rare piece of art and also have a browse around our shop.'

Slado's which is now a family-run business, on George Street in Bathurst, was established 22 years ago.

As its name suggests, the store sell pre-loved books and have more than 20,000 in stock.
