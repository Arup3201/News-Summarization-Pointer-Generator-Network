Seventy-three seconds was all it took Yaya Sanogo. Well, 18 months, 19 appearances and 73 seconds, but when his first Arsenal goal finally arrived, it was wonderfully timed.

It was a strike to puncture the pressure and soothe the nerves. Sanogo was engulfed by supporters and team-mates, while Arsene Wenger punched the air.

A striker who had forgotten the way to goal had found the net at a most crucial moment, before the result was put beyond doubt by Alexis Sanchez, a striker who seemingly cannot miss.

It was Sanchez’s 13th goal in his last 16 games as he continues to rubbish the claim players need time to adjust in England. Where would Arsenal be without him? Wenger may choose not to dwell on that.

What was important for the manager was victory after three games without a win, which triggered familiar complaints about his strategy from some quarters.

For the 15th consecutive year, he leads his team into the knockout stages of the Champions League and Wenger is fiercely proud of this record. There is even an outside chance of topping the group.

There was a clean sheet and an encouraging performance from rookie keeper Damian Martinez but it was not all positive news. Sanogo pulled a hamstring towards the end of the game and captain Mikel Arteta limped off with a calf injury which Wenger admitted ‘looks quite serious’.

Injuries have compounded inconsistent form and the squad is stretched to its limits as it enters the busy festive schedule.

At least Wenger knows his decision to start with Sanogo was justified. The 21-year-old was included ahead of Lukas Podolski on account of his ability to hold up the ball and bring others into the game, which he did instantly.

The game had barely kicked off when Calum Chambers threw him the ball to fight for with his back to goal, near the edge of the Dortmund penalty area. He held off the challenge of Matthias Ginter and flicked a pass to Santi Cazorla, who slipped the ball back to him.

In front of goal, Sanogo made no mistake. He looked offside but the flag stayed down. The Emirates Stadium sighed with relief and sang: ‘He scores when he wants!’

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Sanchez zipped around on the flanks pulling yellow shirts out of line and allowed Aaron Ramsey to slide Sanogo clear again. With a little more time to think, his actions were far less clinical and Ginter had time to recover and make a block.

Jurgen Klopp’s team, too fast and furious for Arsenal in Dortmund in the opening game of this campaign, were simply not the same.

They, too, have seen confidence eaten away by injuries and languish third from bottom in the Bundesliga, a fact overlooked by those who have decided Klopp should replace Wenger.

Dortmund made a sluggish start. It was midway through the first half before they got any toe-hold in the game and began to test Arsenal’s fragile defence. Even then it was not a severe test and Klopp cut an agitated figure on the touchline.

For a spell either side of the interval, Ilkay Gundogan enjoyed good possession in midfield and dictated the tempo, often searching to hit Lukasz Piszczek on the overlap.

Ciro Immobile was close to connecting with a cross before Henrikh Mkhitaryan collected a nod-down from Piszczek and forced a splendid save from Martinez. Like Sanogo, the keeper had stepped forward when it was required.

Martinez thwarted Mkhitaryan again and made late saves, including a terrific one with his right boot from substitute Adrian Ramos.

Dortmund had emerged with greater purpose and adventure after the break but this only helped Arsenal, offering more freedom to Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla and Sanchez as they sprang on the counter-attack.

Roman Weidenfeller made a fine save with his left hand to keep out a drive by Sanchez which fizzed across the slick surface, but was stranded by a lob from the Ox moments later. Weidenfeller turned, expecting to see the ball drop into his goal, but it struck woodwork and bounced clear. Oxlade- Chamberlain held his head.

The disappointment did not last. Sanchez took a pass from Cazorla in the inside-left area, ducked on to his right foot and curled a shot beyond the diving Dortmund keeper into the far corner.

Klopp made changes in a bid to shake a reaction from his team, but they had qualified already and this can play subconsciously. Arsenal have a glimmer of a chance to win the group, but they need to beat Galatasaray and hope Anderlecht win in Dortmund.

Until then, Wenger will bank the win and move on to West Bromwich Albion while praying for no more injuries.
