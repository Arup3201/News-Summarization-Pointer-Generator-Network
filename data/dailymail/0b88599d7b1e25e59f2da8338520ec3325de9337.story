Ex-cricketer Shane Warne and bra tycoon Michelle Mone have denied they are involved, with Michelle saying she would 'never ever meet a guy if he was taken.'

The entrepreneur took to Twitter to confirm that she has been single for the past 18 months, while Shane has also tweeted denying the claims.

Michelle, 42, wrote on Twitter: 'FTR (for the 
record) I’d never ever meet a guy if he was taken. It was done to me and
 I remember that pain. I’ve been single for 18 months, very independent,
 successful and don’t need anyone for anything other than my family.'

Denial: Shane Warne is spotted at Melbourne airport as he brushed off reports that he is involved with Michelle Mone

Warne has brushed off the claims about 
his meeting with the entrepreneur, writing on Twitter: ‘Just read some 
more ludicrous & laughable reporting on me, what an absolute load of
 rubbish! Whatever, time to rack up the air miles again.

It was reported that the former sportsman spent four hours in the millionaire businesswoman’s hotel room - hours after a Valentine’s Day weekend with Liz Hurley.

The 44-year-old former player, who split from the actress last year, allegedly met up with Michelle at her suite in London’s Dorchester Hotel on February 16.

Two days earlier, Shane had flown to the UK where he visited his ex-fiancee at the £6million Herefordshire mansion they bought in 2012.

Warne and Miss Hurley spent the night there before travelling to London and spending a second night together at her townhouse.

They were believed to be trying to rekindle their relationship, with Warne recently hinting they were on the verge of a reconciliation.

But the Australian is said to have visited Michelle at lunchtime the following day, apparently taking champagne and roses to her £500-a-night eighth-floor suite.

The pair emerged separately four hours later, with the underwear firm boss heading to the BBC’s central London office to appear on Radio 5Live show, On The Money.

Michelle, who divorced ex-husband Michael in January last year, flew back to Scotland the next day, while Warne jetted to Las Vegas to take part in a poker tournament.

The mother-of-three was at home in her luxurious Glasgow townhouse on Sunday.

She cancelled a speaking engagement at the Scottish Wedding Show, on behalf of her lingerie company Ultimo, where she was due to appear at 2pm. Mone, who was at the two-day event on Saturday, was said to be ill.

Shane is not the first sportsman to be linked to Mone. In 2012 married footballer Robbie Savage was seen leaving her home in the early hours following an award ceremony earlier that evening. The pair claimed they are just friends.

Michelle, said to be worth £50million, separated from her ex-husband Michael of 20 years in 2011.

Months later, she claimed he had cheated on her with an Ultimo designer, which Mr Mone denied.

The pair had founded their lingerie firm from a spare bedroom in 1996 and launched the first Ultimo bra in 1999.

Modelled
 by stars including Penny Lancaster and Rachel Hunter – as well as Mone 
herself – Ultimo's cleavage-enhancing qualities proved a huge hit with 
millions of women.

Its popularity was boosted in 2000 when Julia Roberts wore one of the bras for her role in Erin Brockovich.

Mone
 embraced the limelight as the company’s public face, and boosted her 
profile with TV appearances on MasterChef and The Apprentice. In 2010, 
she was awarded an OBE for her contribution to business.

Talking
 about the break-up of her marriage, she said recently: ‘Now I think 
that I’m the strongest I’ve ever been, the fittest I’ve ever been and 
I’ve managed to get every single part of my life sorted out.’

In
 November, Mone opened the doors of her new home in Glasgow for an 
exclusive photoshoot for HELLO! magazine, giving readers a tour of the 
swanky four-storey Victorian townhouse which she spent nine months 
transforming from offices into a family home.

On February 11, Miss Mone appeared with Abbey Clancy to launch the Valentine's Collection for Ultimo

Warne was seen flying over to the UK from Melbourne on February 11 before heading straight to the £6million mansion he used to share with actress Liz
