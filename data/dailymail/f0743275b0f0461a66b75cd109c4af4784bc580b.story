Repeat offender: Robert Stone was on parole for a previous meth bust when cops uncovered the meth lab in his retirement village home

A routine traffic stop led police to uncover a meth lab in a Fresno retirement community.

Robert Stone, 64, was found Saturday evening to have about half a pound of methamphetamine between his car and home.

Cops searched the senior citizen’s car after a background check revealed he was remarkably on parole for a previous meth bust.

‘It's shocking, I would never guess that anything like that would go on at a senior citizen village,’ neighbor Robin Schramek told KFSN.

Police made the surprising discovery only because state law allows them to search the car of a suspect under supervised release.

‘When the officers searched the car they located four ounces of methamphetamine in the car, which is a lot of methamphetamine, so that's consistent with somebody who's selling,’ Fresno police Lt. Joe Gomez told the station.

Officers also found plastic bags and an electronic scale in the vehicle, authorities told the Fresno Bee.

A subsequent search of his apartment led to police finding more crystal meth, heroin, and the ingredients needed to cook more of the drugs, sources said.

Meth lab: Stone lived at the end unit in this Fresno retirement community

The evidence: Fresno Police showed off the results of the modest bust, which they say had a street value of about $1,700

Reclusive: Stone was seen as a hermit among the normally social retirement community

The total street value of the bust was about $1,700, police said.

Images of the home show the blinds drawn
 and several signs warning people to go away and give Stone his privacy,
 but it never occurred to anyone it was because a meth lab was inside.

‘Just shocking someone that age would do that, but actually a perfect place to do it, right? Retirement village, who would suspect it going on there?’ Gomez added.

Stone mostly kept to himself and was not very well known by the normally social community, neighbors said.

He only moved in about three or four months ago, according to Schramek.

The ex-con was hauled back to jail and hit with multiple drug charges.
