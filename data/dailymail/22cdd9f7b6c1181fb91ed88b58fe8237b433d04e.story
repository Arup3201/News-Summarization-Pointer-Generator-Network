An eight-year-old Arizona girl who was allegedly snatched from her parents' home in the middle of the night and killed by a family friend died of asphyxiation by strangulation.

The details of Isabella 'Bella' Grogan Cannella's death were released by the Mohave County medical examiner on Friday, a day after Justin James Rector was charged in her killing.

Authorities would still not reveal if the young girl, whose body was found half-a-mile from her home in Bellhead City on Wednedsay, was sexually assaulted. At a press conference on Thursday, Police Chief Brian Williamson said they were still trying to determine a motive for the murder.

Rector, 26, had been staying with Bella's family for a few days before she went missing in the early hours of Tuesday, Williamson said at the press conference.

Her 10-year-old sister told authorities that she saw Bella with Rector when she went to the bathroom around 11.30pm on Monday, and when she returned to her room, her younger sister and the older man were gone, Williamson said.

Bella's family reported her missing around 1.30am on Tuesday.

Later that morning, Rector allegedly shoplifted clothing from Walmart and attempted to hide the clothes he'd been wearing at the time of the alleged murder, Williamson said.

Cops arrested him for shoplifting that day and questioned him in relation to Bella's disappearance.

Killed: Bella's body was found in a shallow grave near her family's home on Wednesday, police said

When her body was found on Wednesday, authorities also discovered 'unique' shoe prints that matched the shoes Rector had been wearing, Williamson said at the press conference.

He was charged with kidnapping and murdering her on Thursday. Williamson said he has not ruled out the possibility of further charges or future arrests.

'My heart goes out to Bella, her family and this entire community,' Williamson said. 'We have completed the mission of bringing someone to justice for Bella's death.' 

Just hours after Bella was reported missing on Tuesday, Rector wrote a bizarre Facebook rant saying he was not a suspect.

'Everyone gonna believe what they chose but as of now shes still not home and talking s*** n making threats doesnt seem like a good strategy on getting her home to me,' he wrote at 8pm Tuesday. 

'Everyones a suspect but ive been interrogated and cleared no charges and im still in touch with the authorities.' 

Facebook profiles reveal that he was friends with Bella's mother, Tania, and other relatives.

On Thursday, KNXV-TV reported that investigators served a search warrant at the family's home and could be heard telling people in the residence to come out with their arms up.

Bella lived at the home with her mother, stepfather and other children who are not Isabella's siblings, said police Lieutenant Jerry Duke. Isabella's biological father is not in the area.  

Dozens of police, firefighters and volunteers have fanned out in Bullhead City neighborhoods, nearby parks and river areas to look for Isabella using ATVs and search dogs.   

On Wednesday night, Bella's mother, Tania, was seen sobbing and screaming 'No!' as relatives comforted her at the wash where the girl's body was found, ABC13 reported.  

Crosses and candles were placed at the scene where the body was found on Wednesday as relatives held each other and wiped away tears.

'Everybody has come together,' her grandmother Sue said through tears. 'It's been wonderful, so we appreciate everything.'

Bullhead City, a city of about 40,000 people along the Colorado River some 100 miles southeast of Las Vegas.

Mourning: Hundreds of people gathered at a park in Bullhead City for a candle-lit vigil on Wednesday
