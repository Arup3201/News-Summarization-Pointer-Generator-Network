Justin Bieber has hired a legal bigwig with a slew of celebrity clients under his belt to represent him following his DUI arrest.

The singer, who was allegedly caught drag racing in Miami early on Thursday, has hired high-powered defense lawyer Roy Black, who has represented numerous stars in high-profile cases.

Black, who is married to Real Housewives of Miami star Lea Black,
 is a civil and criminal defense attorney best known for helping acquit William Kennedy Smith of rape
 in 1991.

He has also represented actor Kelsey 
Grammer, race car driver Helio Castroneves and conservative radio 
commentator Rush Limbaugh on charges he misused a prescription 
painkiller.

In 2012, he represented polo mogul John Goodman, founder of The Palm Beach International Polo Club, as he was sentenced to 16 years in prison for killing a student while drink driving in 2010.

He was also hired by Yankees player Alex Rodriguez as he was investigated by MLB for drug use - but the sports player and attorney later parted ways.

Black appeared beside Bieber at his bail hearing on Thursday afternoon, just hours after police picked Bieber up for allegedly speeding while racing Def Jam rapper Khalil Sharief.

Clients: He represented William Kennedy Smith (pictured together left in November 1991) as he was acquitted of rape, and Jeffrey Epstein, right, when he was investigated for sex with minors

The singer, who was dressed in an orange jail uniform, stood silently and fidgeted as attorney Black spoke.

The attorney told Judge Joseph Farina that he had been retained by Bieber's manager and that his partner had been denied access to Bieber before the hearing.

Black will work with Bieber's Los Angeles based lawyer Howard Weitzman and Miami criminal 
defense attorney Howard Srebnick, according to RadarOnline.

It's not the first time the attorney has been in the spotlight.

He famously helped acquit William Kennedy Smith - a doctor and member of the Kennedy clan - in 1991 after he was accused of raping a 29-year-old woman after they took a walk along the beach.

Legal battles: He represented Alex Rodriguez, left, during his drugs debacle in 2013 before they parted ways and he also defended actor Kelsey Grammer, right, against underage sex allegations in 1995

He claimed that the sex was 
consensual and, although other women stepped forward to claim he had 
also sexually assaulted them, their testimony was not used, and he was 
acquitted.

But Black didn't just win the case; interestingly, his now-wife Lea was a juror on the trial.

In
 an interview with People magazine in 1995, he said that he immediately 
thought she was beautiful when she stepped into the courtroom.

But he said he had no personal 
contact with her until she walked into the bar where he was drinkning 
the night Smith was acquitted.

Nine months later, they bumped into each other at another bar and began dating.

With the success of Black's firm and 
his wife's Lea's Cosmetics company, they can now enjoy some of life's 
finer luxuries, as shown on the show, the Real Housewives of Miami, in 
which his wife Lea stars.

Roy Black appeared in the first two series of the show.

Lea, who appears on the show with 
model Joanna Krupa, is known on the show for her love of diamond 
earrings, Hermes handbags and the couple's mansion on Star Island. They have one son, RJ.

Roy
 Black has also served as NBCâ€™s legal analyst on the Today show and has 
appeared on ABCâ€™s Good Morning America as a commentator and legal 
analyst.

Bieber was arrested at 4am as he drove a
 bright yellow Lamborghini at up to 60mph in a 30mph speed limit zone 
while allegedly racing Def Jam rapper Khalil Sharief.

He had spent a night partying with model Chantael Jeffries and allegedly admitted to officers that he had been smoking marijuana, taking anti-depressants and had been drinking beer.

On Thursday afternoon, he was released on $2,500 bail.
