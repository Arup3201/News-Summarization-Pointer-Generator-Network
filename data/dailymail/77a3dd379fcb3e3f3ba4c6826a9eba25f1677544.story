Navy divers have been called in to investigate a suspected sea mine which has been discovered off the coast of South Australia.

The object is believed to have been reported by a recreational diver and then authorities were called in.

A spokesman for the Department of Defence told Daily Mail Australia the object was discovered on Friday afternoon and that was when the exclusion zone was set up.

The military are currently investigating the suspected sea mine and an exclusion zone is in place 

She said: ''The item is a suspected sea mine, it has not been assessed as hazardous to shipping activity. 

 'It was assessed to be a contact mine and therefore unlikely to function unless touched.

 'It is partially buried and therefore unlikely to move and is unlikely to function unless touched.

'South Australia Police have an exclusion zone in place.'

The object is in 20 metres of water and navy divers are on their way to the site to investigate. 

Sea mine: Police and military will not reveal what kind of sea mine this is or how long it may have been there

Navy divers have been called in to investigate the object, the exclusion zone is still in place 

A spokesman for South Australia Police added: 'We are coordinating a response to safely recover an unidentified object in deep water 400 - 500 metres east of Boston Island near Port Lincoln.

''The public are advised to stay away from the east side of Boston Island.

'The Royal Australian Navy is evaluating whether to remove the mine. 

'It is unknown how long the mine has been buried and how it came to be in the location.' 

Boston Island is 96 hectares and is privately owned, it is located off the Spencer Gulf near Port Lincoln.  

A Department of Defence spokesman added: 'If a member of the public should find a suspicious item that may be unexploded ordnance, do not touch or disturb it. 

'The local police should be contacted who will arrange for military experts to attend and dispose of the device.'
