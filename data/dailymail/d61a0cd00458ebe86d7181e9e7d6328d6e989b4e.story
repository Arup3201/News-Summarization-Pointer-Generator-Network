A massive power outage across downtown Detroit has hit several government buildings, forced schools to close early and left some parts of the city without working traffic lights.

Detroit's public lighting department, which serves areas of the city affected by the outage, said 'a major cable failure' around 10.30am on Tuesday caused the grid to lose power.

Power was slowly being restored to the city on Tuesday afternoon, officials said, but they still do not know the cause of the shutdown. DTE Energy Co.said it is looking into the problem.

The outage plunged employees into darkness, trapped others in elevators and cut off power to police departments, fire stations, schools and jails.
