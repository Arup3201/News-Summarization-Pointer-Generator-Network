Thierry Henry has begun his climb on to the managerial ladder by undergoing UEFA coaching courses in Wales.

The former Arsenal striker, who has recently embarked on a career in punditry at Sky Sports, has made no secret of his desire to become a manager in the future.

And that process has appeared to have started, with a source telling Sportsmail that Henry has been in in Wales for the ‘last few days’ ahead of undertaking a UEFA B licence course.

Henry has been in Wales this week as he looks to complete his UEFA coaching badges in Newport  

Should the 37-year-old pass, he is likely to complete his A licence in the summer.

Welsh national team technical director Osian Roberts tweeted on Tuesday: It was a pleasure to welcome @Thierry Henry to @FAWales U15 camp today @DragonParkNFDC @FAWCoachEd"

The Welsh FA’s headquarters are based in Newport, where Henry will follow the likes of David Ginola in taking the courses.

Henry gave a presentation to the Wales Under 16 squad earlier this week and is set to be joined on the course by former team-mate Freddie Ljungberg.

Interestingly, the ex-France international has been backed to become Arsene Wenger’s successor at the Emirates by Robert Pires.

'Who is the perfect replacement? Thierry Henry?’ Pires said. ‘He understands football and Arsenal.’

Henry certainly hasn’t been shy during his opening weeks as a pundit, either, after airing forthright views on the Gunners before their win against Manchester City earlier this month.

‘They have gone backwards, it looks like they are a team who looks to finish fourth,’ he said. ‘When you look at Arsenal they should be trying to win the title.

'I’m sure Arsene, the fans and the board want more. You can be upset at Arsenal losing to Stoke City but it is the way they went after Arsene and the words they used.

'They are not far but they are missing a big piece. They are missing a (Patrick) Vieira and a Gilberto Silva.’
