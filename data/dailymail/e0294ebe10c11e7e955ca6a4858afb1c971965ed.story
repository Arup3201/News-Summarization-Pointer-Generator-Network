Arsenal have made a dramatic last-minute bid to sign Loic Remy in an attempt to scupper Chelsea’s move for the QPR striker.

Chelsea are close to agreeing terms with Remy after meeting the Frenchman’s £8m release clause - but on Saturday night Arsenal contacted QPR to confirm that they too would pay £8m and will now attempt to persuade the player to join them.

Arsene Wenger will have a natural advantage as a compatriot of the player and Remy, 27, has spent much of the summer holding out for a move to The Emirates and was pictured at games there at the end of last season.

Adios: Chelsea striker Fernando Torres has agreed a loan move to AC Milan on a two-year deal

However, Chelsea did make their move first, having launched their bid on Friday after Fernando Torres agreed to join AC Milan on a two-year loan.

If Chelsea do miss out on Remy it will prove a major blow as Jose Mourinho has insisted the club need three strikers following Torres’ exit. Chelsea’s first-choice replacement for Torres was Roma striker Mattia Destro, but they have been put off by the Serie A club’s £20m valuation.

Remy would be guaranteed more first-team football at Arsenal, with Olivier Giroud out with injury until Christmas and Arsenal lacking any other experienced centre forward other than new signing Alexis Sanchez, who has played more regularly as a wide player in recent years.

If Wenger can persuade Remy to join Arsenal it will not only fill a gap in the Arsenal squad but also represent a significant disruption of Chelsea’s transfer plans.

Form: Remy scored an impressive 14 goals in 26 league games during a loan spell at Newcastle last season

Versatile: France international Remy would give both clubs options both at central striker and in wide channels
