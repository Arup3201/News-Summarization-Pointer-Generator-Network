Three weeks before Echo Huntley died, aged just 36, she and her twin brother, Hollywood star Noah, went for a walk in the Sussex village where they grew up.

‘It was a beautiful day,’ remembers the actor, who shot to fame in the 1990s playing long-haired hunk Luke McAllister in ITV’s Emmerdale, and recently appeared in the box office hit Dracula Untold. ‘We had a cream tea and then wandered up to the 11th Century church.’

As early summer sunlight dappled through the trees on to the ancient graves, Noah idly asked Echo where she’d like to be buried. He recalls: ‘She said in her slightly dismissive way, “Oh, I don’t know. Maybe there,” and pointed to a damp and shady corner of the churchyard.’

Noah asked Echo if she wouldn’t want somewhere more picturesque to rest but, having made her choice, she seemed adamant.

Close family: Twins Noah and Echo Huntley, aged around 15, with their six siblings and parents

Noah, 40, could never have known it, but it was a conversation he would be repeating to his family just a few short weeks later, as they tried to enact her final wishes.

Echo was a lifelong sufferer from the neurological condition epilepsy, but, before she died, appeared to have turned a corner in her treatment. Then she suffered a catastrophic seizure during a day out at the beach. Three days later, on June 6, 2010, she passed away from multiple organ failure.

And so Echo was laid to rest in the spot she had chosen, quite befitting the unconventional life she had chosen, living with her carpenter husband Iain in a gypsy wagon, and breeding pheasants for a living.

Epilepsy, which affects about one per cent of the population, is due to damage to the tissues of the brain which causes disruption in communication between nerve cells.

This can occur through head injury, stroke, meningitis and genetic conditions, or birth trauma – which is rare, but perhaps was a factor in Echo’s case.

Noah and his sister came from a large family of eight children including, remarkably, three sets of twins. When she was born, Echo spent four weeks in hospital. ‘She turned blue just after birth,’ explains Noah.

People with epilepsy have a tendency to recurrent seizures and the type and severity depends on the part of the brain damaged. Alongside drugs known as anti-convulsants, management of the condition involves a healthy lifestyle that includes regular sleeping patterns. In some cases, surgery can help. 

Noah says: ‘As a family we are unconvinced by mainstream medicine for the most part, and relied predominantly on nurturing her ourselves. She rejected most anti-convulsants because of the side effects.’

Dr John Jacob, consultant neurologist at Milton Keynes and Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trusts, and BMI Saxon Clinic in Milton Keynes, says: ‘Anti convulsants have long been the mainstay of treatment for epilepsy no matter what form it takes. This is in part because of the very small risk of death when the seizure is prolonged or sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. But it can be hard for younger patients to commit to a drug which they need to take for long periods or even the rest of their lives.’

While they were growing up, the Huntleys lived a bohemian existence in Sussex, with all the children home-schooled. Echo had her first seizure aged nine. 

Noah says: ‘Doctors felt being at home was the best thing for her, with a twin growing at the same chronological rate and able to support her. There were differences between us academically which became more pronounced as we grew up,’ 

Noah continues. ‘I was looking to go to Oxford University. Echo led a normal life apart from the odd seizure, and she stayed locally.’

Noah joined the cast of Emmerdale aged 19 and then, as his film career took off in his 20s, divided his time between Los Angeles and London. Echo became his solace from the ‘madness’ of showbiz.

In her 20s, unable to drive because of her seizures (the DVLA requires patients to be seizure free for a year to hold a licence), Echo began taking medication and for a decade, this worked. Then her symptoms returned with a vengeance.

Seizures typically last just a few moments but in severe cases, they can occur in quick succession, or continuously – and any episode that lasts for more than five minutes requires urgent treatment as there is a risk of brain damage.

Echo’s fits were lasting 30 minutes or more.

‘Such seizures are often triggered by something,’ says Professor Ley Sander, Director of the Epilepsy Society, Professor of Neurology and Clinical Epilepsy and Honorary Consultant Neurologist at University College London. Perhaps an infection or forgetting medication. But sometimes they just happen without explanation.’

In Echo’s case, no one will ever know why, on a hot May day at Shoreham beach near Brighton with her husband, she suffered a two-hour seizure. An ambulance took her to intensive care, where her family were called to her bedside. She never regained consciousness.

Throughout our conversation Noah is introspective, speaking about the idea that when one twin dies and the other survives there is a ‘connection between heaven and earth’, and that seeing a bird trapped in the eaves of a church ‘felt like a symbol’.

But, perhaps like his sister did when choosing her memorial, he also sees humour even in the bleakest moments. And he speaks of the dreadful time with gentle humour: ‘The day after she died, my agent called, oblivious to what was going on, and said, “We’ve got this great audition. It’s for a film called Waking The Dead…”’
