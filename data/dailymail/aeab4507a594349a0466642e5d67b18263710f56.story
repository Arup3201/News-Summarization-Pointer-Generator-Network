The man who has gained internet notoriety as Angry Dad thanks to his two trouble-making sons, has spoken out about his reluctant rise to fame.

Videos of Mark Orval, 45, from Melbourne, losing his temper over everything from too much chili in his dinner to being busted at KFC with a hangover have received over one million views after his two sons started posting them online.

Mr Orval said his sons Mitchell, 18, and Dylan, 21, have been secretly filming his expletive-laden tirades on their smartphones for a long time but they only recently started sharing them beyond their circle of friends.

'These two s***heads have been doing this for five, six, seven years,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mark Orval, 45, has become an internet sensation  thanks to his two sons and their Youtube channel Angry Dad

Dylan, 21 (right), said he and his brother Mitchell, 18, (left) have always enjoyed provoking their father and filming his reactions but only recently starting posting them online

'Thank god they've smashed and lost a great number of iPhones, because there would have been hundreds of videos I know they'd get so much pleasure in putting up now.'

The 'Angry Dad' clips have had more than one million views between them on Facebook and YouTube, and have attracted plenty of fans online. 

He said he first realised he'd gone viral when his sons tagged him in a video they had uploaded, which had more than 2000 likes.

They then made a Facebook page and a YouTube channel and #AngryDad has since taken off.

Mr Orval said he has been recognised on the street before, but he had resigned himself to the humiliation.

'It's just so embarrassing, in all honesty, having people recognise you as someone who yells at your kids with all those expletives,' he said.

'But it says a bit about society that people can relate.

'It's not ideal, the last thing I want is this stuff spread around but what can I do?

'You try getting followed around with a camera, it's just ridiculous.'

Mr Orval said he had to have an awkward conversation with his boss about the videos, but apart from the embarrassment the videos hadn't caused him too much trouble in his professional life.

'I work for a media company, I'm one of the senior executives there, and it's almost embarrassing to have to explain it to him,' he said.

'People at work have seen it, but at the end of the day I keep my private life and professional life separate.

'And they don't have to live with my two little pr***s as kids.'

'These two s***heads have been doing this for five, six, seven years,' Mr Orval said of Dylan (left) and Mitchell (right) constantly chasing him with a camera 

He said he first realised he'd gone viral when his sons tagged him in a video they had uploaded, which had more than 2000 likes

Of all the videos they've filmed, he said he was most annoyed when his sons followed him to KFC when he was hungover and had lied to say he was getting sushi.

'My wife is a fitness fanatic and getting caught at KFC, having Mitchell jump out from behind a garbage bin and have him film it… it's not worth going through the pain,' he said.

But his wife Sharon just thinks the situation is payback for the trouble he used to give her father when he was Mitchell and Dylan's age.

'She feels sorry for me in all honesty,' Mr Orval said.

'She said the other day that this is all karma for the hassle I used to give her dad when I was 18, 19, 20.'

He said he had to have an awkward conversation with his boss about the videos, but apart from the embarrassment the videos hadn't caused him too much trouble in his professional life

Mitchell and Dylan prank their dad by adding too much chili to his dinner

And despite being pranked so many times Mr Orval says he has no plans to hit back at Mitchell and Dylan.

'My friends keep saying 'Why don't you do this, why don't you do that?' he said.

'But the last thing you want to do is escalate it.

'I'm just hoping it will die its natural death, I don't think retaliation is a good way to help it die down and make it go away.'

In another video titled '#AngryDad busted at KFC' Mitchell follows his father, who has a hangover, to the fast food outlet after he lied and said he was getting sushi

After catching him coming out of the KFC outlet, Mitchell yells out 'Hey D, how's the chicken?'

Despite being pranked so many times Mr Orval says he has no plans to hit back at Mitchell and Dylan.

And Mr Orval insisted the videos were authentic and not staged, despite the fact that he has invested in an app that finds and sells 'user generated content' to media companies.

'Those who know me know that what you see what you get in terms of dealing with this whole frustration,' he said.

'That's just an app that I've invested in that I've developed over last 18 months, it has no relevance, I'm just working on a side project.

'This Angry Dad rubbish has got no bearing on that.' 

In one video titled '#AngryDad busted at KFC' Mitchell, 18, follows his father, who has a hangover, to the fast food outlet after he lied and said he was getting sushi.

Despite being pranked so many times Mr Orval (pictured left being irritated while driving and right being unexpectedly pushed into his pool) says he has no plans to hit back at Mitchell and Dylan, fearing it will only escalate their enthusiasm 

'I know Angry Dad far too well to know he's not getting sushi so I'm just camped outside KFC,' he says in the video.

After catching him coming out of the KFC outlet, Mitchell yells out 'Hey D, how's the chicken?'

'Angry Dad' responds by yelling: 'F*** off Mitchell you're a f***ing stalker, seriously.'

In another video, Mitchell and Dylan prank their dad by adding too much chili to his dinner.

'That's f***ing hot honey. That's f***ing hot!' he yells.

Mitchell and Dylan can be heard laughing in the background as he gets angrier.

'What have you f***ing done to it? Don't be stupid!' he shouts. 

Dylan said his brother had an Angry Dad T-shirt made and now they are getting requests from people wanting to buy one after he posted a picture of it to their Angry Dad Facebook page

Dylan Orval, 21, said he and his brother Mitchell have always enjoyed provoking their father and filming his reactions but only recently starting posting them online.

'We love stirring dad up,' Dylan told Daily Mail Australia.

'He's got a really short temper and he's very, very easy to stir up. 

Dylan added that they planned to keep uploading videos, and would only stop if it started affecting Mr Orval's personal life.   

Dylan said his brother had an Angry Dad T-shirt made and now they are getting requests from people wanting to buy one after he posted a picture of it to their Angry Dad Facebook page.

'Our Pop's suffering from Alzheimer's so we want to start selling the T-shirts and donating money to a charity for Alzheimer's,' he said.
