A woman watched her ex-boyfriend strangle a 19-year-old student she had brought to him as a sex offering, she has testified in his murder trial.

Kathryn McDonough, who is serving a prison sentence for lying to investigators about the teenager's disappearance and death, took the stand on Tuesday in Seth Mazzaglia's first-degree murder trial.

Mazzaglia, 31, is accused of raping and killing University of New Hampshire student Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott of Westborough, Massachusetts, in 2012 after she rebuffed his sexual advances.

Prosecutors began questioning McDonough on Tuesday by asking her point-blank who killed Marriott and she answered: 'Seth Mazzaglia.'

Testimony: Kathryn McDonough looks towards her former boyfriend, Seth Mazzaglia, as she testified in his murder trial on Tuesday. She told the court that she had watched him kill a student in 2012

When asked how, she replied: 'He strangled her with a rope.' When asked how she knew that, she replied: 'I was there.'

She explained she had taken Marriott to their apartment in Dover because Mazzaglia had demanded she find him a sex partner as punishment for leaving him alone for 12 days while she went to camp.

She said she felt she had no 'option' but to take over the young student she had befriended during their job at a nearby mall.

McDonough
 said he had brutally sodomized her a month earlier as 'punishment' for 
failing to find him a sex 'slave' so she was willing to 'try and please 
him' however she could.

'I 
think it would be fitting if the first thing you saw me do when you got 
back is pleasure one of your friends until they died of orgasms and only
 then turned my brutal attention to you,' Mazzaglia allegedly wrote in a
 text message he sent to McDonough.

She added that Mazzaglia wanted her to recruit Marriott as the slave because of her physique and personality, SeaCoastOnline reported.

McDonough is expected to detail the attack during testimony on Wednesday.

Mazzaglia's
 lawyer told jurors McDonough killed Marriott during rough sex with 
restraints. They say he helped dispose of the body and initially took 
blame out of his obsessive love for McDonough.

But
 last week Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley told the jury that 
after Marriott could no longer object to Mazzaglia's advances because of
 the choking, he pushed her underwear out of the way and raped her while
 McDonough did nothing to help.

McDonough, 20, is the key witness against her ex and lawyers on both sides cast her differently.

Prosecutors
 portray her as the sexual submissive, dominated in all aspects of their
 relationship by a man 10 years older than her, but Mazzaglia's lawyers 
say she was the dominatrix, a woman obsessed with finding another woman 
to dominate, and it was Mazzaglia who was her sexual slave.

On one thing both sides agree: McDonough watched Marriott die.

On trial: Mazzaglia, pictured in court last week, initially claimed that he murdered Marriott to cover for McDonough, whom he was obsessed with at the time, his lawyers have claimed

McDonough was 17 when she met Mazzaglia at tryouts for a theater production. She moved into his Dover apartment when she turned 18, during her senior year. It was Oct. 9, 2012 - mere months after she graduated from high school - when Marriott died in their Dover apartment.

Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology. She was a commuter student, living with her aunt and uncle in Chester during the week and returning home to Westborough most weekends.

Marriott had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts.

Marriott met McDonough at a department store near the UNH campus where they both worked.

On the night she died, Marriot text messaged Atwood minutes before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a movie. Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends.

The text message was Marriott's last communication.

Atwood testified that she had sent Marriott two text messages - one at 8.59pm and one at 9.06pm - but Marriott never responded.

Atwood said became worried the next morning when she had not heard from Marriott and contacted her parents.

Mazzaglia told investigators he and McDonough had used Marriott's 2001 Mazda to take her body to Peirce Island in Portsmouth, where they threw it and her cellphone into the Piscataqua River.

The pair then drove Marriott's car to UNH, left it in a student lot and discarded her belongings in trash bins, authorities allege.

McDonough is serving a 1-1/2 to three-year sentence for conspiracy and hindering prosecution.

Defense attorney Joachim Barth told jurors during his opening statement that McDonough bargained her concocted story of what happened that night in exchange for time off her sentence, and that testifying against Mazzaglia is part of her plea deal.

Bob Marriott, the victim's father, said at her sentencing last July that the family grudgingly accepted the plea deal to further the prosecution of Mazzaglia.

Family members describe Marriott as 'gullible' - someone who easily could be taken advantage of because of her trusting nature.

One family friend from Westborough, Massachusetts, where Marriott grew up, called her naive.

'She
 was just a good girl. That's probably what got her in trouble,' Dawn 
Downey said. 'She was too trusting and she was beautiful. Those two 
things will kill you.'
