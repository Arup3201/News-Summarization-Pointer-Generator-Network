In a resounding demonstration of patriotic pride, royal fans drowned out attempts by a group of republicans to sabotage the Jubilee celebrations.

When the anti-monarchists chanted: ‘Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie: Out, out, out’, the pro-royals all around spontaneously broke into a chorus of: ‘Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie: In, in, in!’

Their riposte drowned out the carefully planned protest and was followed up by an impromptu and rousing rendition of God Save The Queen.

Not in the Jubilee spirit: Dozens of supporters of campaign group Republic gathered on the banks of the Thames near Tower Bridge, ahead of the arrival of the 1,000-strong flotilla led by the Queen

The demonstrators gathered at Tower Bridge in a stunt organised by the campaign group Republic.

It bragged that hundreds of supporters from across the country would 
descend on the capital for the ‘biggest and boldest anti-monarchy 
protest of modern times’. In the end barely 60 showed up.

Holding placards and banners saying ‘Citizen not subject’, ‘Power to the
people’ and ‘Democracy not monarchy’, they taunted hundreds of families
nearby.

Tensions between the two groups threatened to spill over and at one point security officers had to step in.

Among the republicans was gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who said
in a speech that he had ‘nothing against the Queen’ but that he hated 
the institution of monarchy.

He said: ‘This Queen has not been a disaster. But you only have to look 
back to the 1930s and King Edward VIII, a man who sympathised with the 
Nazi regime.’

Mr Tatchell branded the monarchy ‘racist’ because there would never be a
black or Asian on the throne while the Windsor family held it, and he 
accused the Queen of not representing all British people as she had 
never visited a gay or lesbian organisation.

Anger: A man holds a placard showing his feelings at the anti-monarchy protest that took place ahead of the pageant

Loud and clear: The protesters waved placards and banners saying 'citizen not subject', 'power to the people' and 'democracy not monarchy' as they called for the abolition of the monarchy

International effort: Republic said the protest involved representatives of the group's branches in Wales and Scotland, as well as a delegation from the Swedish republican movement

Overcapacity: TfLook to their twitter page to state: 'The #DiamondJubileePageant viewing areas are now full; please avoid and find an alternative location from which to view the event

Disrupted: Part of the District Line was suspended due to a signal failure which made travelling around in crowds even more difficult for revellers

Mass: Frustrated passengers travelling into Putney, South West London, found stations flooded with people and the trains themselves were swamped

Packed: Thousands of eager Jubilee pageant spectators overwhelmed the train network which struggled to cope with the rise in demand as people piled into central London

Republic’s chief executive Graham Smith added: ‘People are sick and 
tired of being told they must celebrate 60 years of one very privileged,
very remote and very uninspiring head of state.’

Typical of those pouring scorn on the republicans was John Younger, an 
architect from Godstone, Surrey. He said: ‘The monarchy is the most 
important institution this country has. It is the symbol of our nation.’
