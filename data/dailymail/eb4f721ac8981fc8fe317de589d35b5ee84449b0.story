Heather Watson made a first-round exit at the Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open after losing in straight sets to Sara Errani.

The British No 1 only avoided going through qualifying due to Li Na's retirement from tennis and subsequent withdrawal from her home-town tournament but could not make the most of her opportunity.

Watson struggled on serve, only managing to get 46 per cent of her first serves in, and was broken six times as she went down 7-5 6-4 to the 11th seed.

Speaking after her exit, Watson said: 'Today didn't go how I wanted it to, I played well in patches but didn't keep it up consistently throughout, it was a very up and down match.

'Sara made a lot of balls, she moves well and she stuck in the match the whole way through. That's what won it for her in the end.

'I'm getting back in the gym now ready for next week and the doubles.'
