Two years ago, Kayli Stollak, now 26, turned to her 75-year-old grandmother Gail for advice on love.

After the young New Yorker found herself single after the end of a four-year relationship, the pair decided to tackle the world of online dating together -- using the blog Granny Is My Wingman to keep track of their escapades.

Now, single again with dozens of dating horror stories to tell, Miss Stollak has turned Granny Is My Wingman into a book about the duo's romantic misadventures and the obstacles of modern love.

Single again with dozens of dating horror stories to tell, Kayli Stollak has turned her blog Granny Is My Wingman into a book about the duo's romantic misadventures and the obstacles of modern love

'The book is about getting into a relationship, finding love, being in love, falling in love, and letting it run it's its course,' Miss Stollak told MailOnline.

'We both started online dating to open it up again, and to practice dating - it's always quantity over quality when you start, which eventually leads to meeting people in the real world again.'

After going on a dozen or so dates with men she met online, Miss Stollak took a chance on a guy who gave her his number at a club.

The book, released October 15, reveals just how Granny Gail became so wise in love, revealing her romantic back story

'Normally I would say no, but I was 
going on so many dates anyway,' she said. The date was a success and a 
relationship blossomed that lasted two years. 'We just broke broke up 
after the book got printed, it was a great relationshiop that ran it's 
course.'

Meanwhile Granny, as Miss Stollak calls her, wasn't looking for a relationship
 - she was simply looking to have some fun, and support her 
granddaughter. 'Shes likes her independence, not being committed to 
someone,' said Miss Stollak.

So the pair set off on a dating adventure that proved to be both good practice, and fodder for entertainment.

'Granny has got one setting: real,' Miss Stollak, who works as a TV writer, told Today. 'Friends will sugarcoat things, make it sounds nice. But Granny's like, "Here's how it is. Listen, I know, I've been there."'

The book, released October 15, reveals just how West Palm Beach resident Granny Gail became so wise in love, giving her romantic back story that Miss Stollak never touched on in the blog.

'We wanted to tell that story,' she said.

According to the book, Gail dated her ex-husband for just five 
weeks before tying the knot at 19 in 1954. Six weeks later she was 
pregnant, and two years after that her husband admitted cheating on her.

When a co-worker of her husband's caught her eye at one of their regular dinner parties, the book explains how she began a love affair that spanned the rest of her marriage and then through her 
divorce in her early forties.

Having never moved on from her love affair, she decided to delve into online dating with her granddaughter for support and as a personal challenge.

'We were always close, but I didn’t know as many details about her past,' Miss Stollak told the New York Daily News.

Gail
 said she thought Miss Stollak was old enough to hear the truth and 
finally opened up to her granddaughter about her past. 'I thought she’d 
understand better,' she said, adding that dating online was something 
she was ready for.

But after several failed romantic affairs, Gail has now decided to stick to dating people in 
her building or men her friends fix her up with. Some of them are 
widowers.

'I’ll say, "Well, 
how long is his wife gone?"' she said. 'If it’s not close to at least a 
year, I don’t want to bother with them. Let them go through their 
mourning.'

'Granny has got one setting: real,' said Miss Stollak, who works as a TV writer. 'Friends will sugarcoat things, make it sounds nice. But Granny's like, "Here's how it is. Listen, I know, I've been there"'

As for Miss Stollak, she recalls the 'serial dater' who kept his phone crammed with numbers of girls he met on OkCupid, the
 man so shy he hardly said a word, and the self-professed 'globetrotter'
 who insulted her job at the time -- a cocktail waitress.

After being stood up for the first time, Miss Stollick recalls: 'Granny offered up a gem in condolence, "Better he stands
 ya up now, than at the alter." So true, so true.'

Coming out of a long-term relationship, Miss Stollak said she wanted to move on from her ex-boyfriend but also felt she needed 'practice dating.'

'What do you say on a first date? Where do you go? How do you act?' she asked -- questions she touches on for both generations in the book.

'"Just go out and have fun, Kayli!" That was what I kept telling her,' said Gail, adding that 'in the process of me trying to convince her, she said, "Okay, but you do it too."

'So I would do it on my level, she would do it on her level. And we’d talk about it.'
