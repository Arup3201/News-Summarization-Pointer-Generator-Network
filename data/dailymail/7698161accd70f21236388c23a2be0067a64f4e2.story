A man was arrested in California Saturday night after attempting to hide from the police by  painting his face black.

Jose Espinoza, of Madera, was accused of fleeing a stolen car, and officers later arrested him when he attempted to flee a second time. 

The second time, however, he had used spray paint paint his face and head black in an effort to camouflage himself.

When police found Espinoza, he had spray painted his entire head black in an attempt to camouflage himself

'The camouflage was ineffective,' Madera Police Department said in a Facebook post, where they also uploaded a picture of Espinoza covered in paint. 

The black paint can be seen clearly in his mug shot, where his face is an entirely different color than the rest of his body. 

Espinoza was booked at Madera County Jail and faces charges of receiving stolen property and unlawful taking or driving of a vehicle, according to CBS Sacramento.
