Feeling the pressure: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy indicated the country could be on the verge of accepting a bailout

Spain is inching closer to a sovereign bailout to save its economy but the country is cagey about the prospect of harsh austerity measures like the ones introduced in crisis-hit Greece.

Spanish Prime Miinister Mariano Rajoy indicated for the first time that the country could be ready to seek EU aid.

However, he said he first wanted to know the conditions attached to such a deal and the form the rescue would take.

At a news conference on Friday - the 
first he has attended after the weekly cabinet meeting since he took 
power in December - Rajoy said no decision could be taken until further 
details are agreed.

However, he said he was ready to do what is best for the country.

Many analysts believe a bailout for 
Spain is inevitable, but this is the first time Rajoy has publicly 
acknowledged it.

Even as recent as Thursday Rajoy avoided speaking on the matter.

During a press appearance with Italian Prime Minister 
Mario Monti, he three times declined to say whether he would seek aid
and trigger a concerted action of the European Central Bank and the 
European Union rescue funds to bring down Spain's borrowing costs.

However, he said today: 'I will do, as I always do, what I believe to be in the best interest of the Spanish people.'

Referring to a comment made by European Central Bank 
president Mario Draghi that the bank was examining non-conventional 
measures to defend the euro, Rajoy said: 'We still don't know what these 
measures are.'

There were violent demonstrations in the Greek capital as the full extent of the economic crisis were revealed

He added: 'What I want to know is what these 
measures are, what they mean and whether they are appropriate and, in 
light of the circumstances, we will make a decision, but I have still 
not taken any decision.'

Last week independent auditors calculated that Spain's troubled banks could need as much as 62 billion euro - £50billion - in new capital.

Deputy
Bank of Spain governor Fernando Restoy noted that this worst-case 
scenario was far below the 100 billion euro fund that the 17 countries 
that use the euro have made available to rescue Spain's banking sector, 
which is struggling under toxic loans and assets.

Earlier
it was revealed the three parties forming Greece's new coalition 
government have agreed to ask lenders for two more years to meet its 
fiscal targets under an international bailout that is keeping the 
country from bankruptcy.

Under
a policy document agreed between the three parties, the government will
also seek to extend unemployment benefits and limit public sector 
lay-offs.

The document 
was submitted for approval at a meeting between the 
leaders of the conservative New Democracy, Socialist PASOK, and 
Democratic Left parties.

It is likely a difficult negotiation with Greece's eurozone partners, in particular paymaster Germany, will take place.

They
have offered modifications but no radical re-write of a €130billion 
lifeline agreed in March, which is keeping Athens from the abyss.

An
official said the platform called for the renegotiation of terms to 
secure a two-year extension to the 2014 deadline for Greece to reduce 
its budget deficit to 2.1 per cent from 9.3 per cent in 2011.
