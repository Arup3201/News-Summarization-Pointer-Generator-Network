A pair of recently discovered early stories by prize-winning science fiction author Octavia Butler will be coming out as an e-book in June.

Open Road Integrated Media, a digital publisher, announced Tuesday that A Necessary Being and Childfinder will be compiled in a single volume titled Unexpected Stories that will be released June 24th.

The book will include an introduction by Walter Mosley.

'Unexpected Stories reveals the 
themes that would become Butler's lexicon: the complicating mysteries we
 assign to power, race, and gender,' Mosley writes.

'Reading these tales
 is like looking at a photograph of a child who you only knew as an 
adult. In her eyes you can see the woman that you came to know much 
later; a face, not yet fully formed, that contains the promise of 
something that is now a part of you; the welcomed surprise of 
recognition in innocent eyes,' he continued.

Serious act: Butler was posthumously inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame

Butler's literary 
agent, Merrilee Heifetz, found the stories, written in the early 1970s, 
among the author's papers at the Huntington Library in San Marino, 
California.

According to Open Road, A Necessary Being tells of how the
 leaders of two ancient tribes 'must broker a delicate peace to ensure 
that their peoples are to survive.'

In Childfinder, a young woman 'locates children with budding psionic powers and teaches them to 
protect themselves from society.'

Butler, who died in 2006 at age 58, was one
 of the first black science fiction
 writers to receive mainstream attention and was known for such books as
 Bloodchild and Other Stories and the novel Parable of the Sower.

Butler was the first science fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Fellowship, in 1995.

The
 honor, also known as the 'genius grant,' has also been awarded to 
intellectual luminaries including David Foster Wallace and Junot Diaz.

She was inducted posthumously into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2010.
