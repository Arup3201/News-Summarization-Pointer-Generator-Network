Australia's property market has one of the highest growth rates in the world - well above the U.S, but behind countries like Turkey and China, a new global study says.

Property prices increased by 10.9 per cent on last year, enough to push Australia to seventh place on the The Knight Frank Global House Price Index

Property prices increased by 2.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year alone.

Dubai, who took out the top spot for the fourth quarter in a row, saw a staggering 27.7 per cent median price increase.

Australia has come in seventh on an index of property-price growth

The chairman of CBRE Residential, Justin Brown, told The Sydney Morning Herald Australia's strong ranking did not come as a surprise, and denied it could lead to another property bubble.

Mr Brown also said Australia's close proximity to Asia was one of the keys to the price growth, and predicted that our prices would continue to increase.

'We’ve got quite a pent-up demand both domestically and internationally,' he told the publication.

Dubai, for the fourth consecutive quarter held fast as the country with highest growth in property prices

House prices around the world have risen consistently over the past few years, according to Knight Frank’s associate director of residential research, Michelle Ciesielski.

Globally, the index was up by 0.6 percent, and Kate Everett-Allen, the International Residential Research on the study said 'for the first time since 2008 no single country tracked by the Global House Price Index has recorded an annual price fall in excess of 10%.'

The top three places were claimed by Dubai, China and Estonia, while the bottom three in the index of 54 nations were Greece, Cyprus and Croatia.

The Knight Frank Global House Price Index was established in 2006 and is recorded on a quarterly basis.

The index uses data from official government statistics or central bank data where it's available.
