The creator of Mad Men has hit back over the controversial ‘Falling Man’ style poster for the series by claiming that it is being used by the media to ‘exploit’ 9/11.

Matthew Weiner said it was ‘ridiculous’ to say he was being insensitive by using the billboards, which features a man in a suit tumbling through the sky.

He also claimed the image of a businessman falling out of a window had been around since before the September 11 2001 attacks - even though Mad Men was first shown in 2007.

Weiner was branded ‘cruel’ and ‘tasteless’ over the use of the advert for the fifth season of Mad Men by families of those who lost loved ones on 9/11.

The billboard was put up all over Manhattan including streets close to Ground Zero and shows the black shadow of a man falling against a white background.

New Yorkers said it reminded them of the iconic image of the ‘Falling Man’ who hurled himself out of the World Trade Centre to escape the burning building.

He and dozens of others chose to commit suicide rather than burn to death during the attack which killed 2,977 people.

In an interview with Salon.com Weiner said that the media were just using the Mad Men poster as an ‘excuse to show that picture (the Falling Man) again’.

Weiner said that journalists were just looking for an excuse to ‘trot out’ the Falling Man picture which was ‘always a controversial picture to someone who lived through it’.

He said: ‘As someone who was very, very involved in the (Mad Men advertising) campaign, and trying to get people to watch the show, I was stunned that someone would try to bring it up again.’

His robust comments are unlikely to 
satisfy outraged 9/11 families including Deborah Burlingame, whose 
father Charles was the pilot of the jet which crashed into the Pentagon 
on 9/11.

She has said that Weiner was ‘stupid’ for ‘evoking the tragic memory of those poor souls’ who died during the terrorist attack.

Ms
 Burlingame has said: ‘I think this advertiser has decided that creating
 a controversy, at the expense of the thousands of people who will be 
hurt by this image of man falling to his certain death, is worth it.’

John
 Feal, who heads the Fealgood Foundation supporting 9/11 emergency 
workers, has also said the advert ‘lacks sensitivity’ because for some 
the disaster will ‘always  be an open wound’.

The fifth season of Mad Men is due to premier in the US this Sunday.

AMC,
 the network on which Mad Men is shown in America, has defended the use 
of the advert and said it was a metaphor for the turmoil experience by 
Don Draper, the main character.
