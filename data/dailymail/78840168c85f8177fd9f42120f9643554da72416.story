The parents of a university polo player who was found dead at a doctor's house after a night out have paid tribute to their 'kind and caring' son.

James Steen, 23, a trained huntsman, had been visiting friends at the house in Rugby, Warwickshire, after breaking up from university for the summer holidays.

It is believed he had been on a night out and had returned to the property - only to be discovered dead hours later.

Police have arrested three men on suspicion of murder - but the cause of Mr Steen's death is still unknown and is still being treated as unexplained.

His parents - whose names have not been released by Warwickshire Police - have today released a statement which said: 'We have lost our darling son. Words simply can not convey the pain we are currently experiencing.

'James enriched our lives, and the lives of others, in so many ways.

'He
 was a kind, caring, intelligent and very talented young man, with a 
generous spirit. He touched everyone he met with his positivity and his 
sense of humour.

'We
 are devastated by James’ untimely death, but we are comforted by 
knowing how much he was loved and admired by his family, friends and 
university colleagues.

'We are immensely proud of our son, and all he achieved and the significant mark he made during his brief time on this earth.

'As we come to terms with our loss, we would ask the media to respect our need for privacy at this difficult time.'

The three local men were interviewed over the weekend and have since been bailed until September while investigations continue.

Mr Steen, from Northern Ireland, was a keen skier, studying media, communications and cultural studies at Newcastle University and was President of the Polo Society.

His close friend Steven Williams posted a picture of him on Facebook, with the message: ‘To a really fantastic friend, who only ever treated me with absolute kindness. An utter and complete gentleman. RIP James, I can’t believe this and would do anything to see you again.’

A friend said she had been ‘saddened’ to hear of his sudden death.

Active: James Steen, from Northern Ireland, was a keen skier and had been studying media, communications and cultural studies at Newcastle University. He was also president of the university's polo society

She posted on the group’s Facebook: ‘James was a stalwart of the Polo Club from his earliest days at both Northumbria and Newcastle, where he latterly became Secretary then President. 

‘In developing his game to become a useful and dependable team member, James became a role model to others. He was an outgoing and enthusiastic member of the team in all senses.’

She said he supported the club and its players to his utmost. She added: ‘He put his whole being into the running of the club, and I hope that in coming years we can continue to follow in his footsteps and make him proud. We will all miss James.’

Warwickshire Police arrested three men aged 31, 29, and 25 after an ambulance was called to the property on Saturday at 6am.

The suspects have all now been released on bail and police say they are treating the death as ‘unexplained’. The cause of his death is not yet known. 

Background: James Steen, who had been living in Newcastle, was originally from Poyntzpass in Northern Ireland. His half-brother, Reverend Ivan Steen, is minister at Windsor Presbyterian Church in south Belfast

A local resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘A couple in their 30s live there and they went out with friends on Friday night. I just heard some banging about at around 12.45am.’ They said one of them was a doctor.

A tribute was paid to Mr Steen by the university.

Dr Liviu Popoviciu, on behalf of the university's school of arts and cultures, said: ‘This really sad news has come as an awful shock.

‘James was an extremely bright and ambitious young man... He was a pleasure to teach, always polite to staff and fellow students, and committed to his studies on the degree programme.'

‘We will remember him for his hard work, impressive academic ability and, most of all, his kindness to all.

‘Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.’

Mystery: James Steen's death at the home of a doctor in Rugby, Warwickshire in the early hours of Sunday morning is currently being treated as 'unexplained' by the police

Mr Steen, who had been living in Newcastle, was from Poyntzpass and his half-brother, Rev Ivan Steen, was the minister at Windsor Presbyterian Church in south Belfast.

A neighbour of Mr Steen's family home in Northern Ireland said: 'The family is very, very upset, they can't believe it, can't take it in. 

'They're not able to talk because it's just too hard to take in.'

A spokeswoman for the force said: ‘Shortly after 6am on Saturday the Ambulance Service alerted police to the death of James Steen, a 23-year-old man from Northern Ireland, at a home in Wood Street.

‘His death is currently being treated as unexplained but as part of police enquiries three local men, aged 31, 29 and 25, were arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday morning. They were interviewed over the weekend and have since been bailed until September while investigations continue. Mr Sheen’s next of kin have been informed.’
