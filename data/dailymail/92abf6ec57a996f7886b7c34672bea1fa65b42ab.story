A Kentucky family has suffered through an unthinkable month that has seen them bury both a son and a daughter after each died in separate accidents.

Brice Taylor, 20, died in a June 30 ATV accident only two weeks after his 17-year-old sister, Brianna Taylor, died in a horrific car wreck. Both were only weeks from their birthdays when laid to rest.

‘What has happened to this family with the loss of Brice and Brianna just doesn't seem possible,’ Pastor Scott Kerr was shown saying at Brice Taylor’s funeral on Wednesday in video from WAVE.

Such a tragedy: Brice Taylor, 20, and his 17-year-old sister Brianna Taylor died within weeks of each other in separate accidents

Brianna Taylor was instantly killed in the June 22 wreck after a pickup truck slammed into the Ford Mustang she was driving around 10.30 p.m. just outside Elizabethtown, WAVE reported.

All three of her passengers survived, but were taken to a nearby hospital with severe injuries.

Brice Taylor died July 5 after succumbing to a traumatic brain injury sustained in a freak ATV accident on June 30, according to the station.

The pair’s father opened up about the tough past few weeks at his son’s funeral.

‘I screamed, I yelled, I beat things,’ he told the mourners when recalling how he reacted to his son’s death. ‘When something like this happens, time don't matter no more.’

The exact circumstances surrounding Brice Taylor’s death are not known, but details about his sister’s death have been made public.

The 17-year-old girl’s red Mustang was barely recognizable after being smashed by the pickup truck at an intersection that locals had pleaded with locals to install a stop light and street lights.

‘This is a deadly intersection. At night, it's pitch black. You can see anything in the dark,’ Linda Norris told WAVE.

Beer cans were scattered all around the accident scene, but it police had not said which car they believe the alcohol came from.

Authorities
 are still looking into whether charges can be filed in the 
almost-18-year-old girl’s death, but that was of little solace to family
 attending a second funeral in as many weeks.

Many fought back tears while remembering Brice’s life.

Instead of celebrating milestone birthdays, their family has been left to mourn their loss.
