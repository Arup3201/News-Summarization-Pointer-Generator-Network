A Lil Wayne concert ended on a bad note for a Florida glamor model charged with neglect after leaving her two young children in a car park for about three hours while she watched the show. 

Brittany Harris, 25, was arrested Saturday night after a Cruzan Ampitheater employee found her children, aged five and three, standing alone near a black Nissan Altima in the South Florida Fairgrounds parking lot, surrounded by 'intoxicated persons'.

In his police statement, employee Barry Batchelor said he noticed the kids hanging around unsupervised at about 7pm and approached them at 9.45pm when they were still alone.

Batchelor said the children told them their mother 'went into the 
concert and left them to stay in the car,' according to Smoking Gun.

He then took the children to a venue gate, where he turned them over to sheriff’s 
deputies.

Police found Harris, a hip hop model also known as 'Pretty Red', in the parking lot about 10.30pm when the concert ended.

After first insisting her cousin
had brought her children to the fairgrounds, Harris 'confessed that she
came here and left the kids to stay in the car so she could watch the 
concert', Smoking Gun reported.

Harris was charged with two counts of 
child neglect, with child welfare officers reportedly ordered to take 
possession of the children. 

She is currently in Palm Beach County jail in lieu of a $20,000 bail.

The West Palm Beach model claims on her modeling Facebook page to be a rising star in the hip hop modeling scene.

'Rising as one of the most exotic beauties in modeling, Pretty Red, a Japanese, Panamanian, and black vixen, is certainly making her mark on the industry,' she wrote.

Harris' Facebook page, saturated with pictures of her near nude and with videos of her dry humping the air, has been inundated with criticism from scores of her 'fans'.

One wrote: 'Lmfao this the girl that left her kids in the parking lot to go see Wayne concert..you could have brought them inside for FREE..duh!!! Smh'

Another wrote: 'You left yo kids in the car to go to a Lil Wayne concert??? Bytch you beyond dumb & you don't deserve those kids...'
