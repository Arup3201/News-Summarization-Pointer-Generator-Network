Don't worry, we have not travelled back in time 71 million years ago to the Jurassic World.

This cute pair might look a bit like velociraptors from the Cretaceous period but they are in fact two Boyd's Forest Dragons which weigh just a few grams and are only 5cms long.

Raptor and Nedry were born at Wild Life Sydney Zoo just days apart on October 23 and 25 and they each weigh just a few grams.

Matthew Mooney, reptile keeper at the zoo, said: 'It’s a very exciting time in the Daintree Rainforest zone'

It's a massive achievement for the keepers at the Darling Harbour zoo who say it is 'notoriously difficult' to breed the creatures.

Matthew Mooney, reptile keeper at the zoo, said: 'It’s a very exciting time in the Daintree Rainforest zone, however there is also a stringent observation process in place to ensure these tiny Boyd’s Forest Dragons receive the best possible start to life.'

The tiny creature is just 5cm and only a few grams but they will grow to about 45cm in length

Boyd's Forest Dragons usually spend most of their time perched underneath tree trunks 

Boyd's Forest Dragons are an arboreal agamid lizard found in rainforests in northern Queensland

The creatures are restricted to living in rainforests from north of Townsville to near Cooktown

They usually spend most of their time perched underneath tree trunks

They can move up to 100m a day on the ground

Boyd's Forest Dragons eat earthworms, small fruits and vertebrates 

They are born from eggs which normally measure about 30mm long and 15mm wide 

They have been hand reared since birth and are quickly gaining weight and strength in the attraction’s back-of-house reptile room until they are ready to go on display in the rainforest zone.

Mr Mooney added: 'Raptor and Nedry are the first Boyd’s Forest Dragons to hatch at the zoo in a few years, which is a really exciting development and a true testament to the dedication and passion of our keepers. 

'Boyd’s Forest Dragons are notoriously difficult to breed, so we've been giving these juveniles frequent feeds of insects, taking them outside to enjoy some sunlight, as well as closely monitoring their health daily.' 

Raptor and Nedry will eventually grow to around 45cm and will develop the eye-catching head crests and spikes Boyd’s Forest Dragons are best known for.

The creatures are only found in north Queensland  rainforests, such as the Daintree. 

Due to their relatively small range, the species is susceptible to decline if these rainforests continue to be degraded by agriculture and climate change.
