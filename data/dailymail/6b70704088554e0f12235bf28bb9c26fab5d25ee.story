Bisexuals continue to be stigmatized by the wider public, with a new survey finding that 15 percent of people don’t believe bisexuality to be a real sexual orientation.

The research, carried out by the University of Pittsburgh, has negative implications for the mental and physical health of members of the bisexual community, according to the authors.

Straight men are the least likely to 
believe in bisexuals, but gay and lesbian participants also showed a 
thread of negativity toward bisexuality, the survey found.

‘Bisexual men and women face prejudice, stigma and discrimination from both heterosexual and homosexual people,’ said Mackey Friedman, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health and director of HIV prevention initiative Project Silk.

The research was presented at the American Public Health Association in Boston on Tuesday.

Nearly
 15 percent of an online sample of 1,500 people declared bisexuality 
‘not a legitimate sexual orientation,’ with straight men three times 
more likely to categorize bisexuality as ‘not a thing.'

Women, white people and people who identified as gay, lesbian or bisexual showed the least amount of anti-bisexual bias.

However,
 the researchers cautioned, gays and lesbians were more negative about 
bisexuality than bisexuals themselves, suggesting that prejudice against
 bisexuality still exists in the gay community.

Male bisexuals were viewed more negatively than female bisexuals.

Hiding one’s sexual 
identity can lead to depression and substance abuse, and can 
result in lower rates of HIV testing and treatment.

‘This can cause feelings of isolation and marginalization, which prior research has shown leads to higher substance use, depression and risky sexual behavior,' said Friendman.

Bisexuality has traditionally been viewed as a stopover on the way to someone accepting their homosexuality, or a way for those confused about their attractions to define themselves. 

Record industry mogul Clive Davis and singer Ke$ha are two celebrities who've spoken publicly about their bisexuality this year

Stigma can make it hard for bisexual people to feel socially connected, Friedman said

'Having hard data to back up why a bisexual person might feel the need to be secretive about sexual orientation, something that can lead to higher depression and many other negative health outcomes, is very useful to people trying to fight stigma and marginalization,' he said.

'For example, this information can guide social marketing interventions and outreach to reduce that stigma, and improve rates of HIV prevention, testing and treatment within the bisexual community.'

There are approximately 1.2 million bisexual men in the U.S., of whom 121,800 are HIV-positive.
