Leading companies have been summoned for talks in Whitehall with Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson today

Controversial payday loan firms will not be banned from charging sky-high interest rates, despite a promised government crackdown today on sharp practices in the industry.

Leading companies have been summoned for talks in Whitehall with Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson today amid mounting  concern that they are driving desperate families to financial ruin.

In a toughly-worded intervention yesterday, Miss Swinson said she was determined to curb ‘irresponsible  behaviour which exploits vulnerable  consumers in financial strife’.

But, to the dismay of campaigners, Miss Swinson confirmed payday loan firms such as Wonga will not be ordered to cut their interest rates. 

She cited concerns that people could be forced into borrowing from even  shadier loan sharks.The industry’s many critics insist that the exorbitant interest rates, which can top 5,000 per cent a year, are the root cause of the misery suffered by hundreds of thousands of people taking out payday loans.

Last month the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, called for a legal cap on payday lenders and the level of interest they are allowed to charge.

And the consumer organisation Which? published a study showing that 1million families a month are forced to take out payday loans in order to get by.

It found that almost 400,000  people take out the high interest loans to pay for essentials such as food and fuel. A further 240,000 need the cash to pay existing loans.

Almost half said they could not cover their repayments, forcing them deeper into debt as their ‘short-term’ loans are ‘rolled over’, with fresh interest attached.

Today’s summit comes just days after the £2billion industry was referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission. It will have the power to ban or limit products. But it will take up to 18 months to report.

Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, called for a legal cap on payday lenders and the level of interest they are allowed to charge.

The summit will be updated by the OFT, which said some firms’ business models appeared to be based around customers taking out loans which they are forced to roll over because they cannot meet the repayments. 

This then leaves the customer trapped with that firm because they would struggle to switch to anyone else. Up to half of lenders’ revenues were found by the OFT to come from the extra charges and interest coming from loans being rolled over.

The OFT has given the 50 lenders until the end of July to respond to calls for them to clean up their act or face closure. Five have since surrendered their licence, but only 20 have responded to date.

Labour MP Stella Creasy said that it is essential to discuss capping interest rates

Last night Labour MP Stella Creasy accused ministers of being too cosy with the industry, and warned it was futile to try and tackle the problem without addressing interest rates. 

She said: ‘Having a summit about payday lending without talking about capping interest rates is like discussing arson without mentioning matches.’ 

Mr Welby warned last month: ‘Once you have taken out the loan it is difficult to get out of the cycle. With the rates offered, simply paying off the interest becomes a struggle.’ 

Miss Swinson said the firms would be challenged today over why they had failed to clean up their act and how they planned to put it right.The minister claimed that capping the crippling interest rates charged by payday lenders might limit the market and drive people to seek even more desperate solutions to their financial problems.

She said: ‘Some people say we should just cap the interest rates.But that could shut down short-term loans and force people towards illegal loan sharks or other extreme measures.’ 

Miss Swinson suggested she would focus on limiting the ease with which loans are ‘rolled over’ – a practice widely blamed for driving people deeper into debt. 

And she raised concerns about automatic payment systems that allow lenders to raid the bank accounts of clients in order to claw back money they are owed.
