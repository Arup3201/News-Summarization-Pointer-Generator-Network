He may be one of the world's most composed men - but many have wondered whether his ice cool exterior extends to the golf course.

Now, thanks to three of his playing partners, Barack Obama's golf game and his behavior while playing the frustrating sport can finally be revealed.

And those hoping for a sign of human weakness - such as a club-throwing temper tantrum after pulling a shot left or leaving a putt short - will be sorely disappointed.

Lefty: The left-handed president has spent roughly 1,000 hours playing 214 rounds of golf since he was elected to office in 2008

According to the unnamed fairway companions, the president is an 'honest' stickler for the rules, who never gives up and even makes fun of himself when he hits a duff shot.

One partner, speaking to the The New York Times, said: 'If you came down from Mars and saw his disposition on the golf course, you would think he would be a pretty good president.

'He's honest, he keeps his composure through terrible adversity, he's unruffled, he smiles, and he doesn't quit.'

Unlike previous head of state Bill Clinton, who was not above claiming presidential pardons for lost balls, Mr Obama scores every shot he takes, one of his playing partners says.

The president's love of the sport is well-documented - it is estimated he has spent roughly 1,000 hours playing 214 rounds since he was elected in 2008. 

But his aptitude for the game has remained something of a secret. Unlike Clinton, who released his scores to the press, Obama's trailing media circus is kept out of sight when he's on the tee.

Another playing partner who spoke to the New York Times suggested Obama's game has come on leaps and bounds - as a few years ago 'he didn't have a picture-perfect swing'.

This was backed up by former NBA legend Michael Jordan, a single-figure handicap golfer, who described the president as a 'hack' player - declining to include him in his dream four-ball match.

And short video clips posted online by people who happened to catch him on a course earlier in his presidency revealed he had bad posture when he stood over the ball.

He also often made the age old mistake of failing to keep his head down during his swing, golf pros said.

But his dedicated practice while in office seems to have paid dividend though - as it is rumored Obama's scorecard is now regularly hitting the mid-80s.

In an interview last August, he described how he had come agonizingly close to (a 15ft putt) 'breaking 80' - a proud achievement for any  amateur golfer.

A third playing partner described the president as a picture of composure on the golf course.

He said: 'He makes a bad shot, and he makes fun of himself. You make a bad shot, and he makes a joke with you. He just seems happy to be out there, so the poor play doesn't bother him.'

Hawaii has been one of Obama's favorite golfing getaways since being elected - he recently made a sixth visit to the islands since becoming president.

This year he spent an afternoon at the Kaneohe Bay course with the Malaysian Prime Minister, reports CNN.

At the end of December, it was also reported that a couple getting married near his vacation spot were forced to move their wedding away from the 16th hole because Obama and his friends had planned a round of golf.
