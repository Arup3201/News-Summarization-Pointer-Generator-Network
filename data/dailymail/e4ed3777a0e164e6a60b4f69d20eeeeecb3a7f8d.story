A man in a kilt playing the bagpipes may be a regular feature in Scotland, but beyond the borders it's a somewhat rarer occurrence.

But one patriotic bagpiper is taking Scottish heritage around the world as he aims to be the first Scot to play the instrument in every single country.

Ross O'Connell Jennings, 25, has played in a total of 34 countries and is working his way around the world to bring Scottish music to the masses.

25-year-old Ross O'Connell Jennings is attempting to be the first person to play the bagpipes in every country. The half Scot, half Irishman said his friends thought he was initially ridiculous but are now extremely supportive

A musical fan! At the Giraffe Manor in Nairobi, Ross played for the giraffes to the delight of the creatures, who started marching in a line in time

Ross has so far played at 34 countries, including France, and hopes to complete them all in his lifetime. He usually gets a very receptive welcome when playing abroad, but has had a few close shaves being stopped by Tunisian guards and by Vatican police

Fitting in! Ross says he gets a mixed reaction to the kilt, mostly positive. Here pictured at Doraemonin Tokyo in Japan

The motivational speaker is no stranger to travel, having attended an international school in Shanghai, lived in Thailand for a while, and studied Economics and Chinese at Edinburgh University. 

His father would always encourage him to take his bagpipes wherever he travelled, and Ross realised that he had racked up an impressive number of countries that he had played in. 

'When I told my friends and family that I was going to try and attempt to do every country they thought I was absolutely ridiculous, but are incredibly supportive,' the half Scot, half Irishman said. 

Ross prefers to travel by himself, as he says it is more fun because he meets a lot of people who are curious about his mission and the kilt.

When he was recently in Jerusalem, a girl grabbed him as soon as she spotted his Scottish attire, and insisted that he play on the top of the Tower of David.  

The bagpipes have also proven to be a way to get out of some sticky situations. When travelling in Tunisia, a police guard stopped his rented car and grilled him on why it was not registered. 

Having done prior research Ross knew that the bagpipe was similar to the Tunisian mezoued, and ended up playing for them, to their delight, and was allowed on his way. 

Bit chilly?! Ross has even taken his bagpipes and kilt on the slopes in Canada in a bid to complete his round the world mission

Ross uses the name, The First Piper, on social media accounts, and fans can track his mission on facebook and instagram. Here pictured in Shanghai

Animal audience: Ross has played for a number of creatures along the way. These warthogs in Nairobi appear to be unperturbed by the instrument

Transporting the instrument is one of the hardest part of mission, the bagpiper revealed. 

As they have to be taken on planes as hand luggage, there are always confused reactions when it goes through the x-ray machine. 

'I nearly always get pulled over and asked whether it is a shisha pipe, or a weapon!' he said.  

When Ross reaches a country they are usually very receptive to his playing. The Vatican police were less than impressed, however, and he was almost immediately accosted by officers.

'They quickly silenced me, but admitted they thought it was kind of cool,' Ross said. 

Animals similarly seem to appreciate the bagpipe playing, and the adventurer has counted giraffes, goats, dogs and cats among his audience.

'When I was in Nairobi at the Giraffe Manor they were initially hesitant as to how the giraffes would react to the sound,' he said. 

'I began playing and they actually starting marching in line, it was incredible.' 

'There have been mixed reactions to the kilt though,' Ross admitted. 

At the foot of Kilimanjaro he encountered a group of ladies who were in hysterics at his attire and playing, one of the older ladies even went as far as to call his kilt 'disgusting.' 

It emerged that she had last heard the bagpipes before her husband went to fight in World War 2. 

'It is amazing how the music can bring people together, all over the world,' he said. 'This is something that I am trying to do on my travels, even in a small way.'

When he is not travelling, Ross works in England for a company that runs seminars and motivational speeches in secondary schools. 

'Work have been absolutely phenomenal about what I'm doing,' Ross said. 

'I tend to get holidays when the school holidays fall, which is great for my travelling.' 

The musician saves from his job, and has been helped out by generous contacts he has made, and even the Scottish Saltire Society and Smart Turnout menswear have contributed to his mission. 

Although he does not tend to busk in the countries when he is playing, some people insist on paying for his performance. 

Japan was where he received the most donations, and he had no sooner opened his bagpipe case to take out his instrument when people were already throwing coins into his box and taking photographs.

Ross' next mission is for Ethiopia in April and his travels can be followed on facebook or instagram.

When in Rome: Ross does not just want to travel and see what he can get from a destination, but aims to give back to where he visits, and share  his love for music with them

On the go! Ross has travelled to Wenzhou in China in full outfit. The talented Scot is fluent in Mandarin, and even studied Economics and Chinese at university

Ross enjoys travelling alone as it means he is less threatening to people he meets, and it forces him to be sociable and step out his comfort zone
