Ander Herrera will become an influential figure for Manchester United, says Juan Mata.

Herrera was crowned man of the match after one of the most complete debut performances a player could hope to make, pulling the strings in United's 7-0 demolishing of LA Galaxy at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.

And Mata was all for praising his midfield partner: 'He did great. I know him very well from our days with the Spanish 
national youth teams and he was very good.

Herrera joined United in a Â£29million switch from Athletic Bilbao in June, and was Louis van Gaal's first signing as manager.

It was a move that Mata feels will benefit himself and the entire club.

'I
 am very happy for him,' Mata continued. 'We have a good connection on and off the pitch 
and I think he will give us a lot of good things this season.'

Herrera proved instrumental in Van Gaal's first win as United boss, and put his experience with Mata from their Under-21 days for Spain to good use.

Herrera and Darren Fletcher were the only Reds to play the full 90, as Van Gaal made nine changes at half time.

The Dutchman opted for a 3-4-3 formation against the MLS franchise, a shape the 62-year-old plans to bring to the English Premier League.
