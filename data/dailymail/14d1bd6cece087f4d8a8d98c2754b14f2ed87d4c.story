Sam Allardyce let out a huge sigh of relief before reflecting on one of the most topsy-turvy football matches he has presided over for years.

Two sets of 90 minutes, 30 minutes of stoppage time and even the first 16 penalties could not separate West Ham and Everton in a magical example of FA Cup third-round action.

Then, eventually, finally, dramatically goalkeeper Adrian stepped up, threw off his gloves and struck the decisive penalty to win it 9-8.

'Unbelievable,' was the first word Allardyce could muster afterwards. 'It's a long time since I've experienced those kinds of highs and lows in one match. Such excitement. Attractive football from both teams. End to end.

'Both teams went out and tried to win it. We got what we deserved, no doubt about that. It was a fantastic cup tie, absolutely everything you can imagine was in it.'

Passions threatened to spill over in extra time when Mark Noble started finger-pointing at his own team-mate James Tomkins and the pair had to be separated by Kevin Nolan.

'It was handbags,' Allardyce reasoned. 'They're such big buddies you'd find it difficult for them but they must've been passionate about something. Obviously one opinion was disagreed by the other one.

'I don't know what it was but there's no doubt it will not hang over us after we've won.'

Centre-back James Collins was commanding at the back and would've been man-of-the match had it not been for Kevin Mirallas coming from the bench to change the game, scoring the late free kick to level the game, after Enner Valencia put West Ham ahead, and setting up Romelu Lukaku in extra time for a tap-in. That was still not enough when Carlton Cole came on and forced in an equaliser.

'Collins nearly didn't play,' Allardyce revealed. 'He was feeling his calf a little bit and Winston Reid was not available with injury.'

In a recent interview with Sportsmail, Adrian explained why his cool finish to the tie was perhaps not such a surprise to him.

'I was an outfield player before I was a goalkeeper,' he said. 'I played up front until I was 10 and I loved to score goals but when my Under 11 team CD Altair lost their goalkeeper and the coach asked: 'Who wants to go in goal?' I said I didn't mind while we looked for a new keeper — 18 years on I'm still in goal!'

A clearly devastated Roberto Martinez was left frustrated with referee Neil Swarbrick for only awarding a free kick when Mirallas appeared to be fouled in the box by Tomkins with his side 2-1 ahead.

'It's just disappointing that Mirallas was given a free kick outside box and clearly it's in the box,' the Everton manager said.

'There is no justification how the referee has not seen it. The linesman should've seen the action in the box.'
