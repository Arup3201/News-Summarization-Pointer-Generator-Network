The sister of a U.S. marine stabbed to death by a British man in Thailand said she hopes 'someone kills him slowly and painfully in prison' as the killer was today jailed for 25 years.

Lee Aldhouse, 30, from Birmingham, known as 'Pitbull' in Muay Thai kickboxing circles, pleaded guilty to the murder of 23-year-old Dashawn Longfellow in an attempt to avoid execution or life in jail.

But his jaw dropped when Judge Montri Sarot told him he would go to prison for 25 years. Aldhouse, the first Briton ever extradited to Thailand, had expected anything between 15 and 25 years because of his guilty plea.

'I didn’t think they would give me the 25 years, which was the highest they could give after my guilty plea,’ he said as he was led off to the Phuket Prison.

'I’m going to take further advice and see if I can appeal and get this lowered.’

Aldhouse admitted murdering Mr Longfellow, a decorated veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, after a fight in a bar in the seaside resort of Rawai, on southern tip of the island of Phuket, in 2010.

The Briton, who had competed semi-professionally in the local kickboxing circuit, had been beaten and humiliated after picking a bar fight with the former marine, who was also a kickboxer.

Mr Longfellow's family in the U.S. greeted the sentence with mixed feelings.

His sister, Sabré Anderson, wrote on Facebook after hearing the 25 year sentence: ‘It’s not enough. He doesn’t deserve to get out in 25 years.

‘He doesn’t deserve to live. I hope someone kills him slowly and painful in prison so he can never ever do this to another family.’

Another sister, Marquis Longfellow, wrote on a page dedicated to their brother's memory that 25 years 'is not long enough'.

'Lee took the life of our hero and because of his actions our family will never be able to see the light in my brother's eyes or the smile on his face.

'Lee deserves to rot... in hell.

'Don't get me wrong 25 years is better than nothing but it damn sure is not long enough for a man who intentionally took the life of an American hero for no other reason than a bruised ego.

'I hate Lee and I hope that one day karma will catch up with him ten-fold so he can have a little taste of the pain he has brought to our family.'

The night that led to Aldhouse’s eventual arrest and extradition began on August 14, 2010, in Phuket’s Freedom Bar.

He had challenged others to a fight but no-one accepted - until he and Mr Longfellow, clashed verbally in the toilet.

A fight broke out and, said police, Aldhouse was beaten badly. The humiliation set him on a course that was to end in the murder of the American that night.

Security footage taken in a 7-Eleven near the Freedom bar at around 3am captured a man looking like Aldhouse taking a knife from a kitchen bench where sausages were usually prepared, then walking out without paying for it.

Aldhouse returned to the Freedom Bar at 3.15am but Mr Longfellow and his group had left. Aldhouse was told my someone where the American was staying.

Half an hour later Aldhouse arrived at the Ya Nui Resort II, where Mr Longfellow was renting an apartment and, finding the American had not arrived, waited in the darkness outside.

When Mr Longfellow finally arrived on a motor cycle, Aldhouse ambushed him, stabbing him once in the chest. As the American ran for his life, Aldhouse chased him into his apartment and stabbed him again deep in the chest.

Mr Longfellow's girlfriend, woken by the noise, found him lying on the living room floor. By the time police arrived, Mr Longfellow was dead. A bloody knife was found 300 yards from the scene.

Aldhouse then hired a taxi before jumping onto a bus to Bangkok. From there, he crossed the border into Cambodia border then made his way to Singapore before he eventually flew to England.

British police were waiting for him at Heathrow airport.

He had left the UK years before after serving two years in a Birmingham jail for his part in an armed robbery, a charge that included being in possession of a gun.

Soon after Aldhouse returned to 
Britain, Thai officials took the unusual step of seeking his 
extradition. Britain and Thailand have had an extradition treaty for 101
years, but it had never before been used.

Today
Aldhouse’s lawyer, Kampon Siriwatanyoo, told the Mail: ‘He knew he was 
going to receive a long prison sentence but he did not expect it to be 
25 years.

‘He has already 
expressed his sorrow to the other family at an earlier hearing and he 
has pleaded guilty, so he was expecting to receive a sentence that might
have been as low as 15 years.

‘He
was not happy to hear the judge tell him he was getting 25 years. He is
now going to appeal and he will have to do that within the next month.’

was laid on for Aldhouse's appearance in court today, with journalists 
told they could not even take notes in the court room as the judge 
passed sentence

Aldhouse has told his lawyer that he hopes he will be able to remain in the Phuket prison - just 300 yards from the court building - and not be transferred to a tougher jail further to the north.

Prisoners who receive up to 25 years usually remain in Phuket but conditions in the jail are overcrowded - it was built to hold 700 inmates but today there are 2,139 males and 358 females there, either serving sentences or awaiting trial.

Unprecedented security was laid on for Aldhouse’s appearance in court today.

Photographers were banned from attempting to take pictures of him as he was walked into the back of a prison van to be driven to the court and journalists were told they could not even taken notes in the courtroom.

The judge made no specific attack on Aldhouse when delivering his verdict, but instead summed up the series of events that led to the stabbing of the marine.

Aldhouse stood with his head bowed as the judge read the verdict, but occasionally the prisoner looked up and glanced around the courtroom.

His head fell forward when his interpreter said he was getting 25 years jail and his jaw dropped. He swayed back and forth before regaining his composure.

Then he was led away and driven back to the jail.

In Phuket’s main street and in the surrounding beach resorts Western tourists lounged in coffee shops and bars, enjoying holidays that Aldhouse will be denied for much of the rest of his life.
