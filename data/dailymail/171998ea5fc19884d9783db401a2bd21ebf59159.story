He's the president who has ridden a horse topless, hugged a polar bear and 'found' (fake) Greek vases while scuba-diving.

Now Vladimir Putin is at it again - playing ice hockey with sporting legends in front of thousands of apparently adoring fans.

But the Russian premier, 61, was not without a little help - he missed several goals by a whisker, leaving his celebrity teammates to give the puck a gentle nudge in the right direction, before finally hitting home on his own.

Sports star: Vladimir Putin triumphed in a game of ice hockey in Sochi

First attempt: The Russian president takes a shot at the goal (left) – but it bounces away. A team-mate to the left of the net (right), catches the rebounding puck and taps it into the goal. Putin is said to have scored five assists

Deadly approach: Putin flies down the middle of the rink (left), and takes another shot at goal - and scores when the puck smashes into the back of the net (right)

Sporting the number 11 jersey, Putin returned to the Winter Olympics host city of Sochi today for the All-Russia Festival of Night Hockey League.

Joining the 'NHL Stars' team, the premier took a break from crisis talks with the West about his annexing of Crimea to play alongside retired former Soviet hockey legends, including Vyacheslav Fetisov and Pavel Bure.

At least two of his team-mates were Olympic medal winners, including Aleksey Kasatonov, who won two golds for the Soviet Union in 1984 and 1988, and Valery Kamensky, who also took gold in 1988.

His opponents, meanwhile, were reportedly amateurs.

Even so, the 62-year-old premier's teammates were apparently eager to help him. In at least two attempts, Putin just missed the goal, but the puck went in after a gentle tap from another player.

Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu and the head of Tatarstan Republic, Rustam Minnikhanov, were both at the festival for the league, which was created in December 2011.

It began as a casual event for over-40s but has grown and this year was attended by 108 teams including from 11 other countries.

Putin took part in a gala match between amateur hockey players in a successful games for the Russians - who topped the table ahead of Norway, Canada and the USA with 33 medals.

Sadly for Putin, however, his side was knocked out by Finland at the quarter-final stage.

But the upbeat president reportedly told the crowd: 'There
 are no winners or losers here. This is a friendly game.

'It’s a show and
 everyone enjoyed it. All this [the Night Hockey League] was invented to
 give an additional boost to the development of sports and physical 
culture.'

Adoration: He was also seen shaking hands with ecstatic members of the crowd

According to state broadcaster The Voice of Russia, the President 'netted six goals and five assists'.

The bold claims are, as yet, not fully confirmed.

It is the latest in a long line of macho publicity stunts by the Russian president, who last took to the ice in January, shortly before the Winter Olympics in Sochi.

Stunts: Putin has also been seen plucking (fake) ancient vases from the deeps (left in 2011) and presiding over a tranquilised polar bear (right in 2010)

He has previously cuddled a tame snow leopard and a tranquilised polar bear, and shot harmless crossbow darts at a whale as part of scientific research.

One more bizarre report last year suggested he was inviting the boy band Boyz II Men to a Moscow gig - to boost the country's birth rate.

And in 2011, a spokesman was forced to admit that a scuba-diving exhibition in which he 'found' the remarkably intact remains of two 1,500-year-old Greek vases was staged.

The remains, the spokesman said, had been found by archaeologists and placed there in advance.
