Defiant Alex Rodriguez made his dubious return to baseball Monday night - just hours after Major League Baseball handed the star a 211 game suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs. And even fans of his New York Yankees weren't happy to see him.

A-Rod, the highest-paid player in baseball, was greeted by jeers and boos as he stepped up to the plate for the first time at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago on Monday night. Many of those shouts came from fans wearing Yankees jerseys - including one man who held up a sign reading 'A-Rod, A-Bum.'

During a press conference Monday evening, Rodriguez did not deny that he had used performance-enhancing drugs when asked point-blank by a reporter. Instead, he said, 'We'll have a forum to discuss that and we'll talk about it then.'

Because of the contract negotiated by the
players' union, A-Rod will be allowed to play while he appeals the 
decision - which could last through the end of the 2013 season.

Rodriguez is on a 10-year, $275million contract with the Yankees that will see him play for the team through the 2016 season.

The suspension, if upheld, will bar him from the game through 2014.

Allegations have dogged the 38-year-old Rodriguez since January, when records were released from Biogenesis of America that named him as a client of the Florida anti-aging 
clinic known for distributing banned performance-enhancing drugs.

'The last seven months has been a nightmare, has been probably the worst time of my life for sure,' he said before the game.

But, he said he was happy to be playing 
the game again after spending the first four months of the season 
recovering from surgery on his right hip.

'I am so excited to have an opportunity to wear this uniform and to help this team win,' he said.

His presence, and the distraction it has caused off the field, didn't seem to help the Yankees Monday night.

Rodriguez hit a shallow single in his first at-bat, but then hit a fly out to center field, a line out to left field and struck out looking. The demoralized Yankees - plagued by injuries all season - lost spectacularly in an 8-1 drubbing by the White Sox.

Chicago fans were even more brutal to A-Rod - branding him 'A-Roid' for the allegations of performance enhancing drug use

'The New York Yankees in no way instituted and/or assisted MLB in the direction of this investigation; or used the investigation as an attempt to avoid its responsibilities under a player contract; or did its medical staff fail to provide the appropriate standard of care to Alex Rodriguez' - statement released by the New York Yankees, who had two players suspended'I made an error in judgment that I deeply regret, and I accept full responsibility for that error. I should have handled the situation differently, and my illness was no excuse' - Nelson Cruz, suspended 50 games.'I promise to do everything possible to try and earn back the respect that I have lost' - Jhonny Peralta, suspended 50 games'I made significant errors in judgment during the 2012 season and I accept full responsibility for those errors' - Antonio Bastardo, suspended 50 games

If the suspension ultimately stands, 
Rodriguez will lose around $34million in salary and may have played his 
last game for the Yankees.

Baseball
Commissioner Bud Selig announced the suspension of 13 players on Monday
related to Biogenesis. A-Rod is the only player to appeal.

The rest of the players, including All-Stars Nelson Cruz, Jhonny Peralta and
Everth Cabrera were all banned from playing for 50 games each for their
involvement with performance enhancing drugs, bringing the total to 
18 athletes so far.

By 
benching 13 players, the MLB administrators have handed out the biggest 
sentence since the Chicago Black Sox rigging scandal nearly a century 
ago.

Last month, Ryan Braun received a higher sentence than most of the others - he is suspended for 65 games.

The harshest penalty was reserved for Rodriguez, a three-time Most Valuable Player and baseball's highest-paid star.

The New York Yankees slugger admitted four years ago that he used performance-enhancing drugs while with Texas from 2001-03 but has repeatedly denied using them since.

Rodriguez was suspended under both the drug agreement and labor contract.

MLB
said the drug penalty was for 'his use and possession of numerous forms
of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including testosterone 
and human growth hormone over the course of multiple years.'

His
penalty under the labor contract was 'for attempting to cover up his 
violations of the program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to
obstruct and frustrate the office of the commissioner's investigation.'
