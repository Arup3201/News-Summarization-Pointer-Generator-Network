The wife of ex-Penn State coach Joe Paterno faced an embarrassing situation earlier this week when she was reportedly turned away from a campus pool.

Sue Paterno, 84, is an avid swimmer known for taking early-morning laps in the Pennsylvania pool and relatives were left upset after she was turned away, a source close to her family revealed.

School trustees fired Mr Paterno earlier this month from the job he held for nearly a half-century in the aftermath of child sex abuse charges against former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky.

A university spokesman said he was unaware of a directive ordering Mrs Paterno to be turned away from the pool, which was first reported by the Patriot News of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

But doubts still remained over the story's veracity, after NBC reported the indoor pool was in fact closed to all the public - despite sources confirming she was turned away to the Patriot News and AP.

Mrs Paterno was a longtime fixture at the school and helped raise money for the library and organized Special Olympics on campus.

Mr Paterno was also recently diagnosed with a treatable form of lung cancer - but he is focused on beating the illness ‘and seeing the full truth’ emerge, the source told the Associated Press.

The school had said last week that Mr Paterno still held tenure.

Mr Paterno testified before a grand jury looking into the abuse allegations that a graduate assistant told him in 2002 that he witnessed an incident in the shower in the team locker room.

Prosecutors have said Mr Paterno had 
passed on the information to his superior. But Mr Paterno has said 
specific actions alleged to have occurred in the grand jury report were 
not relayed to him.

'With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more'

Mr Paterno is not a target of the investigation, authorities say. But the state's top cop criticised the way school leaders handled allegations and said Mr Paterno and others should have done more.

Mr Paterno announced his retirement effective at the end of the season, saying that the scandal was ‘one of the great sorrows of my life. With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.’

But the trustees fired the 84-year-old anyway about 12 hours later.

His son, Scott, said last week in a statement that his father’s cancer was diagnosed during a follow-up visit for a bronchial illness. He requested privacy for the family.

Mr Paterno's former players appeared to be heeding the request. Right tackle Chima Okoli said this week that the team knows Mr Paterno doesn't want sympathy.

No. 20 Penn State plays at No. 15 Wisconsin this weekend with a berth in the inaugural Big Ten title game at stake. Mr Paterno is Division I's most victorious coach with 409 wins.

‘We're focusing on Wisconsin,’ linebacker Nate Stupar said on Tuesday. ‘(But) definitely we've been thinking about him, and we're hoping he's doing all right, and just praying for him.’

Mr Paterno was receiving thousands of calls or messages from former players, alumni and other well-wishers - and he was encouraging patience and to trust in the truth, the AP source said.
