Archaeologists have uncovered cave art providing evidence that hunter-gatherer children may have attended a form of prehistoric pre-school.

Researchers have revealed that 13,000 years ago, prehistoric children created art in caves with the help of their parents.

A conference on the Archaeology of Childhood at Cambridge University, starting today, will reveal the latest research into art made by children as young as three in one of the most famous prehistoric decorated caves in France.

Archaelogists found evidence of thousands of lines - a simple form of art or decoration known as finger flutings - made by people running their hands down the soft surfaces of the walls and roofs of the many galleries and passages that make up the complex

Stunning drawings of mammoths, rhinoceros and horses have been found within the five-mile 'Hundred Mammoths' cave system in Rouffignac.

Experts recently developed a method of identifying the age and gender of those behind the drawings, with one of the most prolific artists being a prehistoric girl aged five.

Some of the drawings by children were found high up on walls, meaning they could have been helped up there under the watchful eye of an adult.

Also evident are thousands of lines - a simple form of art or decoration known as finger flutings - made by people running their hands down the soft surfaces of the walls and roofs of the many galleries and passages that make up the complex.

Archaeologist Jess Cooney said: 'Flutings made by children appear in every chamber throughout the caves even those that are a good 45 minutes' walk from the entrance - so far, we haven't found anywhere that adults fluted without children.

'Some of the children's flutings are high up on the walls and on the ceilings, so they must have been held up to make them or have been sitting on someone's shoulders.

Archaeologist Jess Cooney said: 'We don't know why people made them. We can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals, for training of some kind, or simply something to do on a rainy day'

'We have found marks by children aged
 between three and seven-years-old - and we have been able to identify 
four individual children by matching up their marks.

'The
 most prolific of the children who made flutings was aged around five - 
and we are almost certain the child in question was a girl.

'Interestingly, of the four children we know at least two are girls.

'One
 cavern is so rich in flutings made by children that it suggests it was a
 special space for them, but whether for play or ritual is impossible to
 tell.'

Archaeologists first realised that children had produced some of the finger flutings back in 2006.

Fieldwork carried out earlier this year by Cooney and Leslie Van Gelder of Walden University, U.S., shows just how young they were.

Though impossible to date accurately, the images found deep inside the Rouffignac caves - a network created by river systems - are likely to be at least 13,000 years old.

The flutings also raise questions over age identity - whether children were seen as we are now - and apparent gender equality.

Finger fluting also appears in caves in France, Spain, New Guinea and Australia.

Cooney said: 'We don't know why people made them. We can make guesses like they were for initiation rituals, for training of some kind, or simply something to do on a rainy day.

'In addition to the simple meandering lines, there are flutings of animals and shapes that appear to be very crude outlines of faces, almost cartoon-like in appearance.'
