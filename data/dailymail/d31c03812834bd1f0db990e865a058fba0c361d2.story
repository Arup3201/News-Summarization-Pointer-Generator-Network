A man floating on a tube down a Montana river was badly injured when another man leaped off a bridge and landed in his lap.

Andy Hill was having a leisurely outing with his wife Amy in East Missoula when a grown man crashed into him from above, breaking his left femur, chipping both calf bones, and tearing ligaments in both knees.

Hill is now wheelchair bound for months to come and the man who landed on him could face criminal charges.

Leisurely day: Hill was on the Clark Fork River in East Missoula, Montana, a popular tubing spot

‘There was a guy on my lap,’ Hill, a social worker, explained to KECI from his wheelchair.

Hill and his wife were doing what many people do on the Clark Fork River, a common spot for floating, as they drifted along tethered together.

But as they went under the Bandmann Bridge on Sunday, something decidedly uncommon happened.

'Suddenly I had intense pain': Hill was new to tubing as he floated along, tethered to his wife Amy on Sunday

'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry': A sign on the Bandmann Bridge clearly reads 'no jumping,' now Hill and the man who did so anyway know why. 'He kept apologizing' said Hill

Shattered: Now Hill will spend the rest of the summer in a wheelchair and on crutches as his cracked femur, calf bones, and knee ligaments heal

‘Suddenly I had intense pain and I was under water,’ said Hill. ‘Somebody had jumped off the bridge and landed on me.’

Fishabilities: Hill is upbeat in spite of his injuries. The social worker works with disabled people regularly and is now experiencing it personally. The avid fisherman also has a non-profit aimed at teaching the disabled to fish called Fishabilities

As
silly as the accident sounds, Hill is in terrible pain and can barely 
use crutches to get around, so he mostly stays in his wheelchair.

‘He rolled off my lap and he just kept apologizing, ”I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.”’

Police are now investigating the incident, which occurred where county signage clearly reads ‘Loitering on, fishing, diving, or jumping from bridge prohibited.’

Though authorities say the jumper may have received injuries as well, he now faces potential criminal endangerment charges.

Meanwhile, Hill is trying to stay upbeat in the face of such an absurd injury.

‘Who does this happen to,’ he laughed. ‘I don't know of anybody this has ever happened to.’

Hill does, however, know of people who have faced other physical disabilities through his job in social work.

A
veteran fisherman, Hill told KECI he’s even started a non-profit to 
teach those with disabilities how to stay active with through his 
beloved pastime.

Called Fishabilities, the organization aims to ‘help people with disabilities get out on the water and go fishing.’
