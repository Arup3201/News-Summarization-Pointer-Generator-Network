A local survey tells me people like penalty shoot-outs. Make that very local. On Saturday evening, my wife Gerry was on her way out of the house when she passed the lounge door. Briefly in her eye-line the TV, and Brazil v Chile reaching its climax with the first penalty shoot-out of this World Cup.

She stopped momentarily to ‘just watch the first penalty’, and was still there nine penalties later. And she wasn’t alone as over 12 million people saw Brazilian poster-boy Neymar score Brazil’s vital fifth penalty and Chilean fall-guy Jara strike a post and send his team-mates back to the hotel for their passports.

Gary Lineker summed it up. 'There is conjecture about penalty shoot-outs but for me they are GREAT to watch.' And I’m with him on that.

Saturday’s penalty shoot-out was described in excellent fashion by the BBC commentary pairing of Guy Mowbray and Martin Keown.

It is one of the trickiest pieces of football commentary to get right. It is a time to be economical with your words, know exactly the consequence of every penalty scored or missed, know where you are in the penalty kick sequence, have readily at hand any particular telling piece of information about the incoming penalty-taker, implicitly understand each other’s role and most importantly let the pictures do the talking.  And concentrate. Like mad.

Things have got a little easier down the years. The graphics supporting the shoot-outs are clearer for one and the match directors themselves have had more experience of covering them.

That doyen of football commentators, the late great Brian Moore reflected once with typical honesty on the ‘hospital pass’ he had sent his co-commentator Kevin Keegan during the famous penalty shoot-out between England and Argentina in World Cup ’98.

Spoke too soon! Kevin Keegan wrongly predicted that David Batty would score at the 1998 World Cup

David Batty was next up and had to score to keep England’s hopes alive. Moore knew Keegan had managed him and wanted to know how Batty would handle it. A legitimate question but Batty shaped up to take the penalty more quickly than anticipated.

As Batty stepped up to hit the ball, Moore said hurriedly ‘Kevin, you know him - yes or no, will he score.’ ‘Yes’ was still coming out of Keegan’s mouth as Batty missed the vital kick. And England were out.

Guy Mowbray, now firmly established as BBC’s senior football commentator, had the right pace of delivery, Keown , the right snap analysis before and after every kick, and the pictures and remarkable atmosphere within the stadium did the rest.

Been there, done that! BBC pundit Rio Ferdinand was able to reflect on his experiences from 2006 World Cup

With informed out-of-vision opinions from Lineker and Alan Shearer, both World Cup penalty shoot-out veterans, Rio Ferdinand’s reflections on his own experiences and Alan Hansen freely admitting he wouldn’t have the courage to take one, it was a very solid piece of television sport.

On ITV, the pronunciation of Colombian sensation, James Rodriguez, seemed to  create a little fun, Ian Wright, with a flourish, gave it the ‘Ham-Mez’, Clive Tyldesley, the straight-down-the middle James.

I expect they’ll both agree on the pronunciation of FRED before ITV screen the Brazil v Colombia on Friday!

Lost in translation: The pronunciation of James Rodriguez's name caused some fun on ITV
