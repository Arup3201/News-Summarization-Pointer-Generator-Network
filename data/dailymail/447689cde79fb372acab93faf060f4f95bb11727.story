Strictly Come Dancing could fall victim to a BBC mass cull as BBC bosses consider ending popular programmes such as Top Gear and The Apprentice.

Former Director of Communications Ed Williams revealed his concerns that the shows are nearing the end of their ‘natural lives’.

But what the replacements will be remains uncertain as he admitted the Corporation's bosses had failed to come up with a Saturday night ratings winner for years.

Strictly will, over the next five to ten years, reach the end of its natural life, and new formats need to be created

He said: 'I think there’s a series of very popular formats which over the next five to ten years will reach the end of their natural lives, such as Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice, Dragons’ Den, Top Gear, The One Show,' the Express reported.

Williams claimed BBC Chief Danny Cohen believes that those who come up with a successful format should be awarded with a higher salary.

He made the comments after last year's BBC1 dance contest suffered its lowest ratings for a final for four years.

Although more than 11.5million people watched Abbey Clancy as she was crowned the champion of 2013's Strictly, figures were some way behind the performance for the finale for recent years, and proved to be the lowest since 2009.

The figures were low compared to the previous year, when an average 12.4million watched the main programme and 11.9million watched the results show to see gymnast Louis Smith take the glory.

In 2010 the figure was as high as 13million for both shows.

He made the controversial comments in a new book, called Is The BBC In Crisis?, the Metro reported.

Williams also used the book to warn that the best writing talent were avoiding working for the taxpayer-funded corporation because they could not offer them high salaries.

He said: 'What I think is particularly challenging for the BBC is how can they make the case to get the best creative people at the BBC coming up with these ideas when, actually, if you’ve got a great idea, why take it to the BBC?', the BBC reported.
