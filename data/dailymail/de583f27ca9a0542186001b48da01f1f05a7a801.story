A family has vowed to buy only British-made goods - but say they are already struggling to find enough non-foreign products.

When James and Emily Bradshaw set out to avoid anything that was not produced by a British firm, they had no idea how difficult the challenge would prove.

Initially motivated by a desire to boycott international companies who avoid paying tax in the UK, the couple soon decided to avoid anything that was flown into the UK.

Challenge: James and Emily Bradshaw, with their two-year-old son Lucan, vowed to buy only goods made in Britain but had not realised how difficult the challenge would be

Yet their conviction has been tested to the extreme. The family have only recently moved house, and are struggling to find British furnishings and electrical equipment.

The family, from Westerham, Kent, has also been amazed to discover that some of the brands they once thought of as British institutions are actually owned by foreign companies.

The couple had no idea that Cadbury's is now owned by American company Kraft.

Despite the challenges, the couple, as well as their two-year-old son Lucan, are still eating nothing but British food.

Mr Bradshaw admitted that the family had struggled most with fully adopting the British-only 'mindset'.

He said: 'We've realised there are things we just won't get because they're not in season here - like strawberries.

'It's about coming up with other solutions and trying new things, which is a really exciting part of the challenge we have set ourselves.'

Hurdles: The challenge, beginning on January 1, has led to difficulties such as the unavailability of British-made batteries. They soon plan to grow their own vegetables

Mrs Bradshaw, a teacher, initially thought up the idea before her husband decided to implement the rule to all materials - from batteries to dishwasher powder.

Describing the decision, which the family implemented on New year's Day, Mr Bradshaw said: 'Emily suggested avoiding some companies because of tax issues, but I wondered if it was possible to live a normal family life on only British goods.'

The City worker said the family is now testing whether 'it is a viable way of living'.

He added: 'Lucan is too young to appreciate fully what's going on, but he's happy and we've managed to source him warm winter clothes from Wales.'

The family moved to Westerham from nearby Bromley in November and although their dining room remains half-finished due to the cost of British wallpaper, the inspired couple have been sourcing items.

Moving home: City worker James and teacher Emily have also struggled as they have moved home after starting the challenge, forcing them to look for domestic furnishings and equipment

Mr Bradshaw said: 'A month ago we would have agreed that this would cost a lot of money.

'We are finding that this country produces affordable clothing, electronics and foods. But it can take a week to find a British made dishwasher tablet because of the research we have to put in to each item.'

More than 40 days in, the Bradshaws are starting to fear the worst about items they cannot find in the UK, such as pepper, and plan to grow their own vegetables.

Mr Bradshaw said: 'AA batteries are just not produced in the UK, our television does't turn on without the control so we don't know what we're going to do about that one.'

The only company to make batteries in the UK is Hertfordshire's Shield Batteries, but they only manufacture vintage car batteries - not much use for turning on the TV.

Mr Bradshaw has one last problem: 'We also haven't been able to find black pepper, so we were told that during the last war people used nasturtium seeds - it was awful.'
