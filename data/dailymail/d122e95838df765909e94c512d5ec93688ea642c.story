Prison visit: Sheila Lee was on her way to see paedophile Anthony Lee, pictured, in jail when she veered into the path of another car in East Yorkshire

The 70-year-old woman driver at the centre of a horror crash that killed three people had been drinking before driving to visit her paedophile husband in prison, an inquest was told.

Sheila Lee was almost twice the drink-drive limit in April when her Volvo car crossed lanes and went into the path of a Volkswagen Golf near Goole, East Yorkshire.

The impact killed father Derek Sarkar, 46, and his son Ethan Sarkar, 14, while seriously injuring Derek’s wife Karen and their ten-year-old daughter Abbie - as well as killing Mrs Lee.

Mrs Lee, who lived in Wigginton, near York, and was travelling to Doncaster Prison, had 141mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - far above the legal limit for driving at 80mg, the Hull inquest heard.

A third-full bottle of pear wine with vodka was found in her car and remnants of the same coloured liquid were found in a glass. Mrs Lee also had a prescription sedative in her system.

She was visiting husband Anthony Lee, 67, who was jailed last December for seven years and called a ‘monster’ by police for abusing two generations of the same family over 21 years.

He indecently assaulted one victim repeatedly from the ages of 10 to 17, and then - more than a decade later - assaulted her daughter three times, when she was aged between five and 10.

Dr Latifu Sanni, who carried out all three post-mortem examinations, told Hull Coroner’s Court of Mrs Lee: ‘The ethanol may have had a detrimental effect on cognitive functions and motor skills.'

‘The concentration of drugs was of a therapeutic range of use - but combined with the sedative, it may have increased the sedation affects.’

Ethan and Derek Sarkar, both from Birmingham, were sitting in the front of their Golf when the crash happened on a canal bridge. The family were planning to celebrate Abbie’s birthday.

They were hoping to do so with Karen’s friend Jane. Bedding, drinks and Easter eggs for the party at Jane’s house in Selby, North Yorkshire, were all found near their car.

Karen Sarkar said in a statement read out at the inquest: ‘I was sat in the back with Abbie and Derek and Ethan were in the front. We were singing, talking and having a laugh, like anyone would do.

‘I don’t recall the impact but I recall waking up and hearing Abbie screaming. I remember it took an age for them to get me out of the car - I was trapped by my legs.’

Karen spent three months in hospital in Leeds and had pins and plates put in her body. She has had several surgical procedures and will probably need more surgery in future.

She said: ‘I’ve only recently been able to climb the stairs and sleep in my own bed. I have to rely on family and friends for help to do chores.

‘I’m currently seeking professional help as I have anxiety and panic and attacks and Abbie and I are both getting counselling.

'Abbie has a cradle halo brace on her head to protect her neck, so she can’t play with her friends like an average ten-year-old. I’ve lost my best friend in Derek and my beautiful baby boy Ethan. Nothing will ever bring them back.’

Mrs Lee had suffered from depression and anxiety and struggled with drinking problems in the past, the inquest on Tuesday heard.

Her daughter Karen, who was in a Ford Mondeo behind when the crash happened, said she did not believe Mrs Lee had been drinking before they set off from their home to Doncaster.

The Sarkar family released a 
statement, after the inquest. It said: ‘We are devastated by the tragic 
loss of Derek and Ethan and we are thankful that the inquest has now 
taken place.

‘We continue to
support Karen and Abbie as they recover from their very serious 
injuries and as they attempt to re-build their lives. We are all still 
grieving and are slowly beginning to come to terms with our tragic loss.

‘We
would like to take this opportunity to thank friends, family and all 
the professionals that have given us help in our time of need.

‘Now
that the inquest has taken place we would be very grateful if our 
privacy is respected so that we can all re-build our lives and cherish 
the memories of our beloved family members.’

She said: ‘I was following behind her but after a roundabout I lost sight of her for a bit. I continued following her and, as the road had some bends, I kept seeing her ahead.

‘About 400 or 500 yards before the bridge I lost sight of her again. Then I saw a cloud of smoke on the bridge with a bit of burgundy on one side and some silver on the other.

‘The cloud cleared and I saw both vehicles - there was substantial damage and they were completely blocking the road.’

Coroner Geoffrey Saul said all three people had died from injuries sustained in the crash. He also made clear that the coroner’s court does not seek to prove any criminal or civil liability.

He said: ‘I will simply say that Derek and Ethan were in a VW Golf, which was being driving appropriately, when for some reason the vehicle driven by Mrs Lee strayed from its own carriageway and into the oncoming carriageway.

‘There was no evidence of excessive speed but the incline of the bridge meant neither driver had an advanced view of the other car.' Coroner Saul returned a verdict of accidental death.
