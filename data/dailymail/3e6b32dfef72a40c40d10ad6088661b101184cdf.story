France's Benoit Paire insisted he was happy after losing in the first round of Wimbledon because he hates the All England Club.

The world number 71 was beaten in four sets on Tuesday by Lukas Rosol, who will now play Rafael Nadal.

Players normally fall over themselves to anoint Wimbledon as the most special tournament, but Paire told L'Equipe: 'I'm not at all sad to leave this place where the atmosphere displeases me greatly.

'Simply, I hate Wimbledon and I'm happy to leave as soon as possible.'

Paire has had decent results at Wimbledon before, reaching the third round on his last two visits, but he has lost all three of his grass-court singles matches this season.

He was heading into doubles action on Wednesday, partnering Tomasz Bednarek against Aleksandr Nedovyesov and Dmitry Tursunov.
