Master trainer Freddie Roach is torn between urging Manny Pacquiao to land the first-round knock-out which both believe is possible here or taking his time so as not to scare off Floyd Mayweather.

Either way Roach expects the PacMan to stop New York’s Chris Algieri but there is more at stake in Macau’s sold-out Cotai Arena than the world welterweight title.

Pacquiao has to win to keep alive the chance of finally meeting Mayweather in what could become a billion dollar super-fight. But if he does so in devastating fashion then Floyd the Money man might shy away from jeopardising his unbeaten record.

Roach says: ‘Manny tells me he can KO this guy in one round and I believe him. He is back to his best of a few years ago. But if he looks sensational we may frighten Floyd out of fighting us.’

To complicate matters even further, Pacquiao is overdue a knock-out to reinforce his counter-claim against Mayweather for the mythical title of best pound-for-pound boxer on earth.

The Philippines Congressman has not stopped an opponent since he sent Ricky Hatton to hospital in Las Vegas with sudden, scary ferocity.

The confidence that he can do so now is not only based on Algieri’s comparative inexperience as a late-comer to the prize-ring following a successful kick-boxing career.

That barren spell as far as KOs are concerned has coincided with Pacquio’s rediscovery of God and Roach was concerned at times by his star pupil’s apparent reluctance to risk inflicting serious harm upon another human being.

But now Roach says: ‘The old Manny is back.’

Here are the stats ahead of the bout in Macau on Saturday (Pacquiao first): 

Age: 35/30

Weight (probable): 10st 4lbs/10st 4lbs

Height: 5ft 5in/5ft 10in

Reach: 67in/72in

Chest normal: 38in/40½n

Chest expanded: 41in/44in

Biceps: 13in/14in

Forearm: 12in/11in

Waist: 30in/31in

Thigh: 20in/21in

Calf: 13in/13½in

Neck: 15½in/16in

Wrist: 8in; 6½in

Fist: 10in/12in

Record: W56, K0s 38, L5, D2/W20, K0s 8, L0, D0

Supporting evidence for that has come in their final work-outs in the gym at the Venetian Hotel and Casino.

Pacquiao has looked even faster than in his recent fights. Most significantly, his punches seem to have regained their former snap and power.

At coming up 36, he says: ‘I feel young, like I did in my 20s. I feel stronger. I’m hitting harder and, yes, the old aggression is back.’

If he is right then for Algieri, a 30-year-old medical graduate who plans to become a doctor when he quits the ring, it may be a case on Sunday morning of physician, heal thyself.

Pacquiao has agreed to come down three pounds from the welterweight limit for this fight against a light-welter world champion.

Yet, curiously, the undefeated Algieri is the bigger man. Most intriguingly he is five inches the taller at 5ft 10in and has a four-inch reach advantage.

If he stays at a distance behind his left jab it may take Pacquiao time to catch up with him.

Pacquiao would prefer him to trade punches - ‘to simplify my job’ - but does not expect him to do so.

Nor does Roach, at least not for long. He says: ‘The first time Manny hits him with a left he’ll run. The second time Manny hits him with a left, it will be over.’

Algieri sounds ready to heed the warnings saying: ‘Why should I exchange with one of the greatest fighters of all time? If I can keep away from his punches while scoring with my job, why not?’

There speaks a man as sensible as his academic achievements suggest.

But Roach says: ‘Unfortunately for this boy he’s in over his head. And not even the best men Manny has fought have been able to stop him getting inside for long. His college degrees will not help him here.’

Algieri has the courage to put up a fight, as he proved when rising from two first down knock-downs against Russian hard-man Ruslan Provodnikov to win his world title over 12 tough rounds.

But Roach points out: ‘Although Provodnikov can hit, Algieri has never been hit by anyone with Manny’s power. As for his own punching, he can’t crack an egg.’

Algieri, with his blue-eyed good looks of a male model, has the Chinese girls swooning over him in their thousands here.

But for my money, shortly after midday Sunday local time in the world’s busiest casino, he is the one likely to fall faint, in the fifth or sixth round.

Pacquiao v Algieri will be televised live in Britain on BoxNation late this Saturday night.
