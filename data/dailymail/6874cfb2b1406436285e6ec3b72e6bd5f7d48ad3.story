A couple have been given compensation after NHS staff failed to recognise their baby was in distress - leading to her being stillborn.

Wendy Pratt, 36, and husband Chris, 46, sued Scarborough Hospital, North Yorkshire, after staff missed vital signs that their daughter was struggling while in the womb.

The couple had tried for a baby for six years and had finally conceived after undergoing IVF on the NHS in 2009.

But staff at the hospital failed to recognise signs their baby girl Matilda was in distress, leading to her being delivered stillborn in April 2010 at 27 weeks.

The devastated couple, of Filey, North Yorkshire, instructed medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell and the NHS trust has now made an undisclosed payout.

It admitted it had not kept a close eye on Mrs Pratt after her 20 week scan, and that if they had Matilda could have survived.

Mrs Pratt said: 'We have been trying for a baby ever since we got married 11 years ago. Once we got married and felt secure we knew we wanted to have babies.

'We tried for six years and then we had our first and only shot at NHS funded IVF treatment.

'We had spent three years on the waiting list and then we got the call. I thought this was going to be our chance.

'It was a feeling of our life is going to change one way or the other. I was really dreading it but after a while I was really excited.'

The couple were told there was a one in three chance of conceiving and just eight weeks after treatment Mrs Pratt found that she was four weeks pregnant.

She said: 'I was 25 at the time and I was young so I had that on my side. The hospital were optimistic but for me it was already six years of being disappointed.

'We were just ecstatic and we really thought that was it and we have made it. It was a relief that we weren't having to face a childless future.

'From that point were never thought anything would go wrong.'

Midwifery staff told Mrs Pratt her baby was smaller than expected at 20 weeks and that she would need to be closely monitored. 

But it was another seven weeks before a CTG [to measure the baby's heartbeat] and a scan was provided for her baby.

Mrs Pratt, a writer who formally worked as a microbiologist, said: 'It got to the 20 week scan and everything was fine.

Despite midwifery staff telling Mrs Pratt her baby was smaller than expected at 20 weeks and that she would need to be closely monitored, it was another seven weeks before a CTG [to measure the baby's heartbeat] and a scan was provided for her baby

'They said she was measuring small but said it would just be keeping an eye on it. We went away feeling happy and relieved.

'A couple of days later I started having heart palpitations and my GP signed me off work. I relaxed and put my feet up. I had no caffeine or alcohol and I did everything right because it meant so much to us because we had tried for so long.

'Then we got to 24 weeks and she had always been a very active baby. She had a pattern of movements that I knew really well. The movements weren't as defined, weren't as definite. My midwife said it was fine and that some babies are quiet.

'I trusted my midwife because she was my midwife. I just wish that I hadn't.'

But still concerned at 27 weeks, Mrs Pratt explained: 'I listened at home on my Doppler device, which you are not supposed to do, and we listened to the heartbeat and I thought it was slowing.'

She returned to hospital on April 17, 2010, where staff performed a CTG and two ultrasounds which showed the baby had restricted growth and poor blood flow through the baby's umbilical cord.

'It was about 1am and they said they were going to call a consultant. I know there was something wrong. The consultant scanned me and kept asking if my dates were wrong. He said there was a problem with the blood flow.

'They admitted me and I didn't sleep at all. I couldn't feel her moving. They took me to a scan and the baby's fingers were moving and the consultant said it looked like there had been an improvement.

'They sent me home and I was only home for an hour when I said to Chris I didn't feel right and we went back.'

Mrs Pratt then readmitted herself because of the continued lack of foetal movements, and another ultrasound was performed that same day. She had seen three different consultants at Scarborough Hospital.

On April 20 they were transferred to Leeds General Infirmary for another scan and a CTG.

She said: 'We drove ourselves to Leeds and I felt like they were waiting for the baby to die. They didn't even give us an ambulance.

'They were getting me to sign things and preparing me for surgery and were getting ready to spray me with the epidural and her heart started to slow down.

'It was Chris who had to tell me that she hadn't made it. She still had a heartbeat but it stopped during the delivery. It was all really quick.'

But the baby's heart rate started to drop as Mrs Pratt was prepared for an emergency C-section. Matilda was delivered by emergency caesarean and could not be resuscitated.

She said: 'There is just a catalogue of mistakes that ended up costing my daughters life. Waking up in theatre was a dividing line to my life before and after my child dying.'

Mrs Pratt said the couple have since used their compensation for three more rounds of IVF treatment - sadly suffering two miscarriages in 2011 and 2012. Now they're urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes don't happen again

The couple decided to take legal action and York Teaching Hospital NHS Trust have now agreed to pay an undisclosed amount after admitting that had they performed a CTG scan after her 20 week scan, Matilda would, on the balance of probabilities, have been born alive.

The couple have since used their compensation for three more rounds of IVF treatment - sadly suffering two miscarriages in 2011 and 2012.

Now the couple urging others to speak out to make sure the same mistakes don't happen again.

'It's important that people speak out. The NHS is being pushed to its limits and if you keep pushing them then mistakes will happen.

'If people don't speak up then nothing changes.'

Sarah Coles, a specialist medical lawyer at Irwin Mitchell's Leeds office, representing the couple, said: 'This is a tragic case that has left Wendy and Chris absolutely devastated by the loss of their longed-for daughter Matilda.

They have both found it incredibly difficult to accept what happened and they have needed extensive support to help them come to terms with their loss.

'What is clear is that the midwives made a number of errors and failed to detect and act upon basic signs which highlighted things were not right and ultimately led to Matilda being stillborn.

'Whilst we welcome the admission of liability from the Trust and settlement, it remains very difficult and painful for the family to come to terms with the fact Matilda's death could have been avoided.'
