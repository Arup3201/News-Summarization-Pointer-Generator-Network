Machines sold under Hotpoint, pictured above, and Indesit are being recalled of fears of an electrical fault which could lead to fires

Hotpoint is recalling hundreds of thousands of dishwashers over fears they are catching fire due to an electrical fault.

The company said there had already been 18 'incidents' involving the overheating of faulty dishwashers which were sold under the Hotpoint and Indesit brands.

The new recall, which involves machines mainly manufactured between 2008 and 2010, is separate from the 283,000 Hotpoint dishwashers which were previously recalled.

In that incident, more than 844,000 dishwashers made by Hotpoint and Bosch were sold with an electrical component fault, which can lead to a blaze.

The firm said customers who have registered their machines will receive a letter from the manufacturers explaining how to check if their dishwasher is one of those being recalled.

But it is also urging customers to get in contact to arrange a visit by an engineer if the machine carries the model number FDW70, FDW75, FDW80 or FDW85A with a serial number between S/N 50401 and S/N 80531.

The company said: 'As the leading white goods manufacturer, Indesit Company continually monitors the specification and performance of its products.

'As part of this ongoing process, we have identified that there is a low risk that a component fitted to a limited number of Hotpoint and Indesit dishwashers manufactured predominantly between January 2008 and July 2010 sold in the UK may cause overheating and in rare cases a potential fire hazard.

'This fault can be easily and quickly repaired by our qualified engineers who will visit affected customersâ€™ premises and fit a newly manufactured component free of charge.

'We are currently in the process of directly contacting all the registered customers we have on our database as an owner of one of these appliances.'

In May, an investigation found thousands of dishwashers remained unaccounted for following the separate safety recall.

The dishwashers were sold under two brands - the Bosch Dishwasher FD 7901 to FD 8504 and the Hotpoint Dishwasher with serial numbers beginning DWF3 and DC26.

The models were manufactured between 1999 and 2005 but may have been bought after this time.

The firm said there had been 18 incidents with the faulty dishwashers and that customers should get in touch to arrange a visit from an engineer

Which? magazine also launched an investigation in April 2012 after Government figures revealed that faulty appliances caused 6,000 household fires in 2010/2011.

The report found there had been a 'disproportionate' number of fires caused by the dishwashers, even when the size of the Hotpoint company was taken into account.

According to that, Bosch has reported 410 incidents in homes caused by the fires, and Hotpoint has reported 38.

Both companies said that many of the machines were likely to have fallen out of use over the years because they were manufactured some time ago.

The firm said anyone who believes their machine is 
one of those affected can visit Hotpoint.co.uk or indesit.co.uk and
