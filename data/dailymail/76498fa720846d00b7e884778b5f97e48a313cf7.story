Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg has said Banksy's work is not art and should not be allowed

The mayor of New York has said work created by British artist Banksy is graffiti and should not be allowed. 

The mysterious British artist is staging a month-long 'residency' in New York City carrying out a project called Better Out Than In. 

However, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said defacing people's property is not his definition of art. 

Speaking at a press conference, he said: 'I'll leave it up to our Department of Cultural Affairs. 

'But look graffiti does ruin people's property and it's a sign of decay and loss of control.

'Nobody's a bigger supporter of the arts than I am. I just think there are some places for art and there are som places (not for) art. 

'You running up to somebody's property or public property and defacing it is not my definition of art. 

'Or it may be art, but it should not be permitted.

'And I think that’s exactly what the law says.'

Banksy, a pseudonym for the elusive artist who first emerged in the streets of Bristol and whose real identity is unknown, has become a coveted contemporary painter in the art world, known for his trademark spray-paint stencils on buildings that offer social commentary.

His artwork can sell for six figure sums. 

He surprised even the most ardent fans earlier this week by secretly selling his authentic artworks near Central Park for just $60 each on Saturday.

The artwork stand opened about midday with an inventory value estimated in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.

People gather to look at new artwork by British graffiti artist Banksy at Lower Manhattan in New York

Each small to medium-sized canvas is worth at least $30,000.

Yet over seven hours, just three people bought eight canvases - a total haul of $420.

The first sale was at 3.30pm to a woman who bought two canvases for her children - and she managed to wrangle a 50 per cent discount.

Half an hour later, a New Zealand woman purchased some art. Video shows the vendor embracing her warmly and kissing her cheek.

At 5.30pm, a Chicago man stopped saying he wanted art for his new house: 'I just need something for the walls.' He left with four original Banksys.

The disinterested-looking vendor shut up shop at 6.30pm.

Each day during his Better Out Than In residency, Banksy has posted a snapshot of his latest project and includes the location for fans to check out.

The work varies from simple stencils to large, detailed murals.

But four pieces of work have so far been destroyed by vandals.

Rat: The vandal who tagged this Banksy piece left the message, 'We don't need no more rats!'

The latest hit were a stencil on the side of a building in Woodside, Queens, and a car that was part of an installation on Ludlow Street on the Lower East Side.

The Ludlow Street piece includes an actual car parked in front of a wall covered in horses wearing what appear to be night-vision goggles.

On Friday, a beaver stenciled on a wall in Brooklyn by the elusive artist also was damaged.

The piece, which depicted a beaver leaning up against a railing, was covered with spray paint that read 'we don't need no more rats!' in red capital letters.

The beaver's face also had been chipped off.

The vandalism was signed 'Math,' likely the name of another graffiti artist.

Earlier this month, rival graffiti artist 'Omar NYC' spray-painted over a Banksy piece in Red Hook, Brooklyn.

Banksy's work getting vandalised is no surprise; other graffiti artists - often jealous of his notoriety - will deface his work, many in misguided attempt to make a name for themselves.

One of his most recent imprints on the city is an image of the Twin Towers, painted on a TriBeCa wall in black paint and adorned with a bright orange flower. 

On Tuesday, a man tweeted several photos along with the message declaring: 'I found Banksy.'

Twitter user @DjJonHenry posted four photographs online showing a group of men and two trucks used for Banksy’s recent Sirens Of The Lambs and Waterfall mobile works of art.

Henry said the photographs were taken at a warehouse in the Red Hook area of Brooklyn and that he approached the men after recognising the vehicles from Banksy’s on-going month-long residency.

The men refused to answer when Henry 
asked where Banksy is, although he tweeted that he thought the man on 
top of the truck might be him since as he was directing the others and 
spoke with an English accent.

After his rather provocative declaration to having found Banksy, Henry then backtracked on his claims after receiving a deluge of negative tweets from fans of the street artist who accused him of trying to jeopardize the remainder of Banksy's month-long show.

Although the artist has never confirmed his identity, his real name is believed to be Robin Gunningham and he is from Bristol, England.

Previously photographs purporting to show Banksy were taken in Santa Monica in 2011 and East London in 2007.

Banksy, whose work has been painted on the sides of buildings around Bristol, London and other cities, has always insisted he will never reveal his true identity.
