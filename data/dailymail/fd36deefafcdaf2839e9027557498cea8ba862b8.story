A globe-trotting foodie has been awarded a five-star review by TripAdvisor who named him their top UK contributor for 2013 - after he posted over 500 reviews in the year.

Connoisseur Chris Hobson, 46, wrote the most restaurant reviews on the travel website, with 295 dining experiences rated - which made up just part of his 512 reviews in just 12 months.

In a typical week, Mr Hobson, a national account manager for a finance company who lives in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, eats out twice for pleasure, has one overnight stay in a hotel while away for work, and takes out clients three times.

While his lucky wife Jacky, 51, is wined and dined with eight to 10 weeks a year on holiday, which gives him the opportunity to write reviews of restaurants, hotels and attractions all over the world.

Mr Hobson said: 'I embrace TripAdvisor. I think I've got a bit obsessed with it.

'I eat out a lot. A big part of my job is entertaining customers.

'I have customers from Aberdeen to Plymouth and if I go and see one I take them out for lunch or dinner.'

He said: 'I embrace TripAdvisor. I think I've got a bit obsessed with it'. I'm a Yorkshireman, so I don't pull any punches, but I understand it's someone's livelihood'

Mr Hobson, who has been reviewing for about 18 months, said: 'I just try to be frank and fair in my reviews.

'I would say 90 per cent of my reviews are very good or excellent.

'I'm a Yorkshireman, so I don't pull any punches, but I understand it's someone's livelihood.'

Mr Hobson spent three weeks in South Africa over Christmas - and wrote 75 reviews while he was there.

He says he has had threats from business owners where he has written bad reviews.

'One restaurant owner told me if I didn't take it down, there would be "physical consequences".'

He refused to take it down and replied to the message in a 'polite manner' explaining the reasons for his review.

Barbara Messing, for TripAdvisor, said: 'We wanted to recognise some of the shining stars from our global travel community.

'It is our community's insightful reviews and opinions that have made Tripadvisor the world's largest site for planning a trip.'
