Ever wanted to create your own adventure starring your favourite Disney characters? With Disney Infinity that’s entirely possible.

This all-new gaming platform combines Disney’s most popular franchises with one of today’s hottest trends in toys – interactive figures that come to life in video games.

On launch, there will be 17 collectible characters to choose from including
Sulley from Monster’s Inc., Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, and Mr. Incredible, from The Incredibles. There are also 40 interactive game pieces and accessories to collect.

Players can place real-world toy versions of their favourite Disney characters on to a device called the Infinity Base and transport them into the virtual game worlds of Monsters University, the Incredibles, Cars and Pirates of the Caribbean.

Ace up its sleeve: Although it's hard to ignore how similar the mechanics are to Skylanders, the Toy Box mode - if pulled off correctly - will be everything Disney fans could ever want

Although parallels to the phenomenally successful Skylanders' 'Portal of Power' mechanic are hard to ignore, Infinity’s ace up its sleeve is its unique Toy Box mode. 

Here, players can build their own adventures and worlds featuring hundreds of characters, vehicles, items and environments, including Scrooge McDuck’s money pit, a Tron Recognizer, the Dumbo flying elephant ride and Stitch's Surfboard.

Players can also use the logic editor to create any kind of game or experience, such as action adventures, obstacle courses, capture-the-flag, tower defense, car races – even re-create some of their favourite classic arcade games

It’s helped along with vibrant cartoon graphics, faithfully recreating Disney’s much-revered heroes.

It’s scheduled for release in August.
