West Indies have mutually agreed to part company with coach Ottis Gibson with immediate effect.

The announcement comes on the eve of the beginning of the one-day international series with Bangladesh, with the Windies team manager Richie Richardson taking charge on an interim basis.

'The WICB wishes to express its gratitude to Mr Gibson for his unwavering commitment and professionalism during his tenure as the coach of the West Indies team,' said a statement on the Windies Indies Cricket Board website.

Gone: Ottis Gibson has left his role as West Indies head coach with immediate effect

Glory: Gibson led the West Indies to the World Twenty20 title in Sri Lanka in October 2012

Gibson took up the post in January 2010 after a spell as England's bowling coach and his finest moment with the Windies came when he led them to victory in the ICC World Twenty20 two years ago.

However, the Windies only won nine of 36 Tests under the 45-year-old, with only four series victories, three of which came against lower ranked nations

They beat Bangladesh twice and Zimbabwe and lie eighth in the Reliance ICC Test rankings, while speculation was rife that he was set to leave his role after it was reported he did not train with the team on Monday.

WICB chief executive Michael Muirhead added: 'On behalf of the board and West Indies cricket as a whole we express our gratitude to Ottis for his work, particularly in coaching the team to winning the ICC World Twenty20 in 2012, and offer our best wishes to him in all his future endeavours.'

The rest of the coaching staff remains unchanged for the schedule against Bangladesh, which encompasses three ODIs, the first of which begins today, a Twenty20 international and two Test matches.

Moving on: Gibson took charge of the West Indies in January 2010 but he has left his post by mutual consent
