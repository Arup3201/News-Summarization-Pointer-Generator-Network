The property market is running hot in Australia, with an increased number of homes and units being snapped up for well over their reserves.

The sale of a terrace home in Surry Hills, in Sydney's inner east, has definitely proved that, with the owner making a whopping $450,000 profit in just 12 months.

Belle Property Real estate agent Con Fotaras says the owner bought the 48 Buckingham street, federation style bungalow home for $960,000 last year, off a private owner.

Bought at $960,000 last year, 48 Buckingham street, Surry Hills, it made a $450,000 profit when it sold on the weekend

The two bedroom house in 48 Buckingham street Surry Hills sold for more than $200,000 over the reserve on Saturday, and all the owner did was give it a new coat of paint and lodge a DA approval for a four bedroom, three bedroom house

'He had intentions to renovate the two bedroom property one day but his circumstances changed, his tenant moved out, and he decided to sell it,' he said.

Mr Fotaras said he didn't do much before selling it, just styled the property and gave it some cosmetic work, including a coat of paint and some lights.

'He spent maybe $10,000 (on cosmetics).' 

A development application was also lodged for a four bedroom, three bathroom home. 

That was enough to make it attractive to buyers and in an auction on the weekend an investor from Strathfield  paid $210,000 over its reserve, selling for $1.41 million.

'The market has moved since he bought it,' said Mr Fotaras. 'The market is buoyant and strong.'

'We are finding that the inner city market is fairly strong and a lot of investors are looking.'

'This property has car access, close to public transport, it's very attractive to a lot of investors and it has mixed zoning which could include commercial, so there's flexibility,' he said.

Mr Fotaras said the 113 square metre property is unique because it's an 1861 terrace which aren't being built anymore.

The real estate agent says Surry Hills has always been one of the stronger areas and plenty of investors are right now still buying.

'High growth investment area, you're not going to go wrong, cafes, restaurants, transport, infrastructure.'

'Surry Hills has always been one of the stronger areas and plenty of investors are right now still buying,' said Belle Property real estate agent Con Fotaras

'Surrounding suburbs are also strong like Redfern, waterloo and Roseland, new buildings are going up, there's a tramline going in the next three to five years,' he said.

'The rental market has dipped but that's because a lot more people are buying.' 

Mr Fotaras said he also recently sold a property in Bourke street, Surry Hills, a one bedroom, art deco, 1928 building with no parking and 100 people went through.

'The reserve was $530,000 and it was sold for $647,000.'

Mr Fotaras also talked about a property he sold on the 13th of September in Redfern which went for a staggering $1.09 million.

In 1999, 67 Kepos street had a mere reserve of $330,000 - $360,000, but earlier this month sold at auction for more than three times that price.

He said the last two sales in the same street went for $865,000 and $885,000. 

Mr Kotaras says auctions across Sydney have been booming.

With more than 700 auctions, there was an astonishing new record for a September Saturday, with the Sydney market securing it's eighth consecutive weekend clearance rate above 80 percent.

'Auctions are better because people would just normally look at a house prices and walk away.'

'But there is a point the market will become more stable,' he said
