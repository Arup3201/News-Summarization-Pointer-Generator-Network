Arsenal legend Ray Parlour is adamant that Premier League referees must be more willing to give penalties when there is an excessive amount of pushing and shoving in the box.

Although Parlour believes that football is a contact sport and therefore coming togethers are inevitable, he does not believe officials are being stringent enough with penalising offenders who overstep the mark.

The 41-year-old former England midfielder is just the latest high-profile sportsman to show support for Sportsmail's Hands Off In The Box campaign.

A member of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' side who went the whole season unbeaten in 2003-04 on the way to the Premier League title, Parlour knows what it takes to win tight football matches but he believes players such as Stoke City's Ryan Shawcross have overstepped the mark.

Parlour, who was helping to launch Europcar's new Golf Buggy Travel Service at the World Travel Market, told Sportsmail: 'It's a contact sport and really you've got to be tight to your man when defending in the box but sometimes it can go too far. You're told in training don't let him score – it's as simple as that.

'I think the referee has got to go into the dressing room before the game and say: 'Look, I'm expecting contact but as soon as that ball's kicked I'll be looking around and seeing who's holding who'. Then if people do hold each other that should be a penalty.

'We saw Shawcross give one away and he's not the only one but he's done it before.'

However, Parlour believes football must remain a contact sport and that officials need to be careful with how they do decide to punish offenders.

Parlour - who won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, a League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Arsenal - believes the majority of those successes were built on a strong defensive unit, and that sometimes they got away with using the dark arts to prevent goals.

He continued: 'It is a contact sport though so we have to be careful not to remove all of that.

'If you say that you can't touch someone at a corner, he's going to run straight across you, you don't know when he's going to run and then he's going to get ahead of you. As a defender you're taught to be tight and don't let them move.

'But it's when they're holding someone back with the obvious ones that they've got to clamp down on.'
