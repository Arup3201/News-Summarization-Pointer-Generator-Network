'We were determined to create a highly intuitive machine that was both stirringly fast and immense fun to drive - a car we ourselves would want to own.

They said they designed the super car to have a 'contemporary silhouette of striking proportions'

Pricing will start from £55,000 and initial sales will be confined to the UK and North America

'We have endeavoured to endow it with class-leading ergonomics and a contemporary silhouette of striking proportions, and the aim of uncompromising build quality has underpinned the project since day one.'

Initial sales will be confined to the UK and North America (dealers are currently under appointment in both countries), but the intention is to make the car available in the other key European countries, China, Middle-East etc in due course.
