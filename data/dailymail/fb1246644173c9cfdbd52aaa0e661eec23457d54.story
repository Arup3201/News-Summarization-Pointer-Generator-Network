They are mother nature's version of a snowman - perfectly-curled rolls of ice and snow that look more like the work of aliens or late-night pranksters.

These unusual 'snow tubes' are an extremely rare phenomenon found most commonly on the frozen and windswept prairies of North America, not on a car windscreen in Wyckham Market in Suffolk.

But nevertheless, Paul Ballard, 53, and his wife Clare, 48, were greeted by the bizarre sight when they went to de-ice their silver Nissan Navara on Sunday morning.

They reluctantly cleared it away - but not before taking some pictures for posterity of the rare natural formation.

Clare, an antiques and furniture dealer, said: 'I was just in amazement. I couldn't believe my eyes.

'The car was about to be taken to the garage and so it was a shame when we had to clear it off because it was really pretty.

'I'm not to sure how it happened, it just appeared. I would have loved to have seen it happen.'

Also known as snowrollers, snow bales and snow doughnuts, the phenomenon requires a precise balance of air temperature, ice, snow, moisture and wind. They are essentially a wintry version of tumbleweed.

Met Office forecaster, Helen Chivers described the exact science behind the formations and said it was nature's version of a snowman.

'It’s not a bog standard snow roll, the sort that you might see in snow covered open fields on a windy day,' she said.

'It
looks like the snow has melted slightly and the wind has peeled it off 
the windscreen forming a roll and fresh snow has fallen onto the 
windscreen. I suppose its natures version of making a snowman.

Wintry tumbleweed: They begin with a thick layer of snow, 
with the top layer just on the point of melting which becomes 
sticky and can be peeled off the colder and more powdery snow beneath 
by the wind, forming a roll

Snow slip: Also known as snowrollers, snow bales and snow doughnuts, the phenomenon requires a precise balance of air temperature, ice, snow, moisture and wind. In this case the snow on the roof of the car was dragged down as it curled on the windscreen

'A classic snow roll happens with the combination of lying snow and high wind speeds, mostly in North America and Northern Europe, and they can be as small as a tennis ball or as large as two feet across – depending on how strong the wind is and how smooth the surface of the snow is.

'They begin with a thick layer of snow, with the top layer just on the point of melting. That layer becomes sticky which can be peeled off the colder and more powdery snow beneath by the wind, forming a roll.'

Temperatures in the county had plummeted to below zero as a wintry conditions swept through much of Britain.

Elsewhere: A photographer stumbled across this scene of 'ice marbles' on grass in freezing Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, which formed after water spray from a nearby fountain turned into ice almost immediately
