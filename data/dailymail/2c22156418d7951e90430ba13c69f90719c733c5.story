From food to houses, it appears there is very little that a 3D printer can’t be used for.

And now a hacker in Berlin has built a website that lets people design their own sex toys, as well as 3D print them out.

Users can create different shapes, as well as adjust the height, curviness, colour and angle of the toys to produce a 3D computer model.

One hacker in Berlin has built a website (picutred) that lets people design their own sex toys, and print them out. Users can create different shapes, as well as adjust the height, curviness, colour and angle of the toys to produce a computer model

The website shows a basic shape of a sex toy. Users can click on points on the outline of the 2D model to transform its shape.

A 3D model changes according to their design tweaks.

Users can change the height, width, curviness, angle and the colour of the sex toy as well as other options.

It is possible to create bizarre shapes.

A box displays statistics about the toy including how much silicon is needed to print it out.

In theory, users could print out their design themselves.

If they do not have a high quality 3D printer, the site lists places in Berlin that can help.

This can be printed on a public 3D printer, or reserved for printing at home.

Ikaros Kappler used programming language Javascript and 3D library Three.js to build his ‘extrusion/revolution generator’.

Users of the website are greeted with an outline of a basic sex toy and can manipulate different points on the 2D drawing to change its shape to suit their preferences.

The height, width, curviness, angle and the colour can be altered by selecting various options to create strange shapes, the likes of which may not be on offer at places such as Ann Summers.

A design immediately appears as a colourful rendered 3D model to reflect the changes made to the initial basic shape.

A small box on the right-hand side of the generator displays information about the design, such as the toy’s height, weight and volume, so that the amount of silicon to make it can be calculated.

While most people do not have a sufficiently advanced 3D printer at home that can handle piping silicon, the tool does, in theory, allow anyone to print out a sex toy of their own design, Geekosystem reported.

The website suggests a number of Hackerspaces in Berlin that could help – if someone is brave enough to ask for assistance.

The generator also lets people order a mould and a silicon toy, or just the mould itself, but the people involved in the idea warn: ‘The software and the silicone casting is still somewhat experimental. Results may vary.’

The cost of 3D printers is falling all the time, but many affordable consumer offerings only allow people to print objects made from crude ‘strings’ of molten plastic - meaning the result is not smooth or professional looking.

However, high-end printers are being used to make prosthetic limbs, plaster casts and even kidneys and 3D printed tumours.

Giant versions of the machines are currently being used to created £3,000 bungalows in China, for example, and the technology could revolutionise kitchens too.

A PancakeBot created in Sweden earlier this year can 3D print interesting pancake designs, while another machine creates piped snacks made from crushed insects.

The curviness and style can be altered by selecting various options to create strange shapes (pictured) - the likes of which may not be on offer at somewhere such as Ann Summers.

'Extrusion/revolution generator' lets people design sex toys from scratch

The generator was created and built by a Berlin-based hacker

Users create different shapes and adjust the height, curviness, colour and angle of the toys to make a 3D model

This model can then be printed on public or private 3D printers
