A California woman was reunited with her classic Ford Mustang nearly 30 years after it was stolen, when a man tried to register the muscle car at a Department of Motor Vehicles office.

Lynda Alsip said she couldn't ask for a better Christmas present than the return of her  1967 Mustang, The Monterey County Herald reported on Monday.

'I never thought I would see it again,' she told the newspaper. 'It's like winning the lottery. It happens to very few people and for it to happen to me, it's just an amazing feeling.'

Present: The vehicle, Alsip's first car, was stolen from her 28 years ago and was recently recovered by the California Highway Patrol

Alsip was 17 when she purchased the vehicle in 1985 for $800 - and the muscle car was stolen approximately twelve months later outside the apartment complex she lived in, the newspaper reported.

Police say the vehicle was found at the Department of Motor Vehicles in Salinas in September when a man tried to register the car he had for 23 years.

Authorities are looking into if the man knew the Mustang was a stolen vehicle, The Monterey County Herald reported.

'It had been out of the system for so long that it came back with no file,' California Highway Patrol Officer Jaime Rios told the newspaper. 'The officer did some digging and found out the car was stolen in 1986 from Salinas.'

'It's astonishing that it has stayed here,' Alsip told The Salinas Californian. 'For so many years and not so far away. I wonder how many times I might have driven past the house or been in the area?'

'At first I didn’t think it was going to be a happy call,' she told The Monterey County Herald. 'None of my kids were home, and both are at a driving age. But then [Officer Chris Menchen, who researched the car] asked me if I had ever had my car stolen and I immediately thought: "Oh my god! You found my green 1967 Mustang!"'

According to the newspaper, Alsip's now-deceased father assisted with the money to buy the car in 1985. Alsip told the media outlet his reaction to the found vehicle would have been 'Only you, kid.'

'He taught me how to change the oil in vehicles on this car,' she told NBC Bay Area. He’s no longer with us, so it’s very bittersweet.'

Alsip, who now lives in the central California valley town of Hollister, plans to have some work done on the car then show off her original personalized license plate, 'LYNDA67,' The Monterey County Herald reported.
