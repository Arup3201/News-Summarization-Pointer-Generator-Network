Hundreds of freshers got into a lather when they took part in a massive foam fight to mark the traditional student welcome at Scotland's oldest university.

The students pelted each other with shaving foam at St Salvator's Quad in the University of St Andrews, the messy end to the university's annual 'raisin' weekend.

Students were left covered head-to-toe in the foam, which was so thick some were even able to style their hair using it.

Others meanwhile found the time to make a romantic gesture amid the madness, with some couples kissing while covered in the foam.

Raisin Monday weekend is designed to help new students integrate more easily into life at the university, whose alumni include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

It comes from the time when freshers were 'adopted' by senior students and even now each first year student is invited to join a 'family' of senior students.

The tradition dates back to the early days of the university when new students would give senior students - known as 'guardians' - a pound of raisins in gratitude for their help in adapting to university life, in exchange for a receipt written in Latin.

Failure to produce such a receipt could result in a dousing in the local fountain.

Nowadays, the raisins have been replaced with a bottle of wine and the dousing with foam.

In a break with tradition, the new students sometimes present a gift to older students in exchange for the receipt.
