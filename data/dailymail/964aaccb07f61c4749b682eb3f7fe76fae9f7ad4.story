Harry Redknapp has branded Adel Taarabt a ‘blatant liar’.

Redknapp claimed after his QPR side’s 3-2 home loss to Liverpool a week ago that his maverick Morocco midfielder was unpickable because he was ‘three stone overweight’.

The player was quickly able to disprove the claim and sent some stinging criticism Redknapp’s way, insinuating that the manager rarely bothered attending training.

Redknapp said: ‘None of what he said was true. I’m out on that training ground every day. When people say I’m not there all morning, that is a blatant lie.

‘When you’re on someone’s side so much and you get let down, at some stage you crack. Like with your kid misbehaving, you say “don’t do that”. In the end you get the hump and you send them to bed. That’s how I felt on Sunday.’

Taarabt trained with the first team on Saturday but is not in the squad for Monday's home match against Aston Villa.
