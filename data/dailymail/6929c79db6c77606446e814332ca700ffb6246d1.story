Ouch: Cory Weddington III (pictured) put a police officer in a world of pain after allegedly squeezing his testicles while being arrested outside a nightclub

A teenager made an eye-watering attempt to escape arrest by squeezing and twisting a police officer's testicles during a scuffle outside a nightclub, it has been alleged.

Cory Weddington III was thrown out of the Havana Lounge in Dallas, Texas, at around 4am for underage drinking, according to police reports.

But he refused to leave the outside area until he had retrieved his credit card, which he thought was still in the bar.

Officers say they gave him 'several opportunities to leave with his friends', but he wouldn't listen.

When police arrived, he became aggressive, so an officer used an arm lock to force the 19-year-old to the floor.

It was then that Weddington reached up with his right hand and grabbed the officer's privates.

According to gawker.com, the police report said: 'The officer put pressure behind his ear and told him to let go, but he squeezed harder.

'The officer then punched him in the face, but Weddington only squeezed more and began to twist his hand, causing the officer "extreme pain".'

Weddington only relinquished his hold after the officer punched him multiple times in the face, it was claimed.

Weddington was later charged with resisting arrest, assault of a public servant and public intoxication.

While searching his pockets, officers found he had his credit card all along.
