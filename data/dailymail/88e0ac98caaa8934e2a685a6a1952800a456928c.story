Vile: Khloe Kardashian took to Twitter to deny the shocking allegations made by Robert Kardashian's ex-wives, who claim he told them that Khlow was not his daughter

Khloe Kardashian isn't one to keep quiet and today she branded her father's ex-wives 'disgusting'.

She took to Twitter to deny the shocking allegations made by Robert Kardashian's ex-wives, who claim he told them that Khloe was not his daughter.

The 27-year-old reality TV star posted: 'The audacity you have to 
mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a
lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! 
(yes you know who YOU are).'

The posts were clearly directed at Jan Ashley and Ellen Pierson who have both spoken out to say that Robert told them Khloe was not his.

Ms Ashley, who married the businessman 
after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told
me that after we got married.'

And
Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before 
his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell 
the truth' about the Kardashian family.

Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter

The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.

A spokesperson for Khloe told MailOnline today: 'The story is NOT true. It’s ridiculous.'

But while Khloe has slammed the allegation she has herself questioned if she was adopted on the family's reality TV show.

Viewers of Keeping Up With The Kardashians did see her question who her parents were in an episode in 2009.

The reality star wanted to prove she was not adopted and tested the maternity of her mother Kris Jenner.

Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney

While she proved she was Kris's daughter she did not compare her DNA with her siblings to prove conclusively that Robert is her biological father.

In an explosive interview with Star 
magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it
was a matter of fact. He said "Well, you know that Khloe's not really a
Kardashian, don't you?"

'And I said… "OK" and that was it.'

Voicing concerns: In a 2009 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians Khloe questions if she is adopted

Proof: Khloe made Kris take a DNA test to prove she was her child but she did not confirm paternity

She claims Khloe, who is married to 
Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different 
father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.

'Khloe brought it up all the time. 
She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, 
light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three 
children.'

She said Robert,
who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not 
sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived.

'[But] he never would have considered
a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that 
Khloe was his,' Ellen said.

'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.'

Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.

Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'

Daddy's little girl: Khloe shared this adorable picture of her with her father, who died in 2003, on her blog in 2010

High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994

Kris,
56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during
their marriage.

Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.

The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.

Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.

Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.

Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.

On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.

She
wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to 
post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and 
to Bruce.

'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up 
because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than 
anything, but adored each other as well.

'My dad and Bruce were always really close — Kendall and Kylie even called my dad Uncle Robert which I loved.'

She
continued: 'Father’s Day is always a bittersweet holiday for me because
I of course miss my dad, but it also reminds me of how truly blessed I 
am to have had two incredible fathers.'
