Europe captain Paul McGinley has lined up former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to speak at the team dinner at Gleneagles on Tuesday evening.

Ferguson is a friend of assistant captain Sam Torrance, and turned up to watch the European team practice on Tuesday morning. His presence continues a recent tradition of star performers from other sports saying a few words in the team room. 

Four years ago it was Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards while Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola spoke at Medinah last time.

McGinley said last week that he had lined up someone of similar stature and Ferguson certainly fits the bill. He has turned up at a number of Scottish events on the European Tour over the years and is believed to play to a handicap of 18.

Where were you when they took the decision to cancel the 2001 Ryder Cup? I was in a small Canadian outpost that had a Walmart, a nine-hole golf course, a Holiday Inn and ...er, that was about it.

We had been diverted there on September 11. For five days we walked the course, wandered the supermarket and gathered each evening in the hotel bar where the New York-based flight crew sang karaoke songs about their home town against the backdrop of those sad, horrific images of 9/11 playing out on the television.

Some good came out of it from a golf point of view. When the match was played the following year, it ushered in an era of respectfulness that has been a feature of every Ryder Cup since.

'He's a guy that I played with in the JP McManus pro-am about 15 years ago and that I've seen now and again over that time, and when I became captain I asked him,' McGinley said of Ferguson.

'Of course he was more than willing to help. But the one thing he asked me to do was keep it really quiet. Walking around (the course) is not keeping it quiet, is it? We wanted a bit of a surprise for the players but I guess it's not a surprise.'

West Ham fan McGinley joked that Ferguson would not be giving any of his team the famous 'hairdryer' treatment, with the Hammers coincidentally making the trip to Old Trafford on Saturday.

'Although I'm a West Ham fan, I've always loved the way his teams played and there's a number of things that he's dealing with that he was particularly good at that I think he'll be a particularly strong fit,' McGinley added. 

'He's asked me a lot of questions and I know he's very keen and looking forward to tonight. He's a big fan of golf, as we know. He knows Rory (McIlroy) very well and Rory is a big Man Utd fan. Not everybody in the room is a Man Utd fan, so that should be a bit fun.

'This is not about him being a headmaster and coming in and preaching to them. He's very aware of that. This is relaxed. This is a conversation. There will be questions coming back at him.

'They all love football and a chance to spend a bit of time with one of the greats in soccer doesn't come around very often, particularly with somebody they all admire. In my dealings with him, he's been absolutely fantastic and I know he'll be great with the players.' 

McIlroy and Graeme McDowell were kept apart on Tuesday as Europe's players prepared for their first official practice rounds.

The European team gathered for a photocall on Tuesday morning, and spirits seemed high ahead of the showdown in Scotland.

McIlroy and McDowell have been regular partners in team events since 2009, winning three of their four matches in the Seve Trophy and also representing Ireland in the World Cup that year and 2011.

The Northern Irish duo have also played six times together in the Ryder Cup, including the first match at Medinah two years ago, and would seemingly make an obvious pairing at Gleneagles

However, European captain McGinley said on Monday that their record of two wins, three losses and one half from those six matches meant they were not a formidable pairing 'written in stone', and Tuesday's practice line-up offered hints about possible alternative partnerships.

With the 12-man team split up into four groups of three, McIlroy was alongside Medinah hero Martin Kaymer and Spain's Sergio Garcia, with McDowell alongside France's Victor Dubuisson and Sweden's Henrik Stenson.

It was no surprise to see good friends Justin Rose and Ian Poulter in the same group with local favourite Stephen Gallacher, with Thomas Bjorn, Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson making up the other threesome.

All three played in the Wales Open last week, with Westwood and Donaldson playing together in the first two rounds at Celtic Manor.

Europe were due to practice at 11am with the American team starting at 9:30am and split into three groups of four.

Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, who played three matches together at Medinah, were out with Matt Kuchar and Jordan Spieth, while Jim Furyk, Zach Johnson, Hunter Mahan and Patrick Reed made up the second group.

Keegan Bradley and Phil Mickelson, who won all three of their matches two years ago, were out with Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker.
