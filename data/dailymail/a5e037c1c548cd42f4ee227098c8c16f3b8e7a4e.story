Britain’s spy chiefs have launched a recruitment drive for Russian-speaking agents amid mounting tensions with the Kremlin.

MI5, responsible for protecting the UK against terror attacks and other security threats, has placed an advert on its website calling for Russian language specialists to apply.

The drive comes amid warnings of a new Cold War between Russia and the West as tensions continue to rise over the military stand-off in Ukraine.

A new recruitment campaign for Russian speaking spied has been launched by MI5 and the Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ

Up to 50 Russian spies are said to be operating in Britain, with ex-MI5 boss Jonathan Evans claiming there has been ‘no decrease in the number of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in the UK’ since the end of the Cold War.

In 2010 Russian Katia Zatuliveter was accused of being a Kremlin spy after it emerged she had had an affair with Commons Defence Committee MP Mike Hancock.

She denied the claim and later won an appeal against deportation from the UK.

The scandal came after a ring of 10 Russian spies were rounded up and deported from the US.

One of the spies, Anna Chapman, had lived and worked in London before marrying and gaining a British passport.

The new recruitment campaign is being run jointly with Government’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ, which gathers intelligence for the Government and Armed Forces by tapping phones and monitoring the internet.

MI5 are also looking for Mandarin-speakers following increasing tensions with China over British ‘interference’ over the civil rights protests in Hong Kong.

A job vacancy advert placed on the MI5 website reads: ‘Coming soon: A recruitment campaign for Russian language specialists/linguists in conjunction with our sister agency.

‘This will launch in mid-November 2014 and will be an exciting opportunity to match your language skills to a position in MI5 of GCHQ.’

Another similar advert for language specialists is also listed online but with ‘Russian’ replaced by ‘Mandarin’, the most-spoken language in China.

The Mandarin advert states that posts will also be open at MI6, which is responsible for intelligence gathering overseas.

The two adverts offer salaries of up to £30,000 in London, where MI5 and MI6 are based, and in Cheltenham, home to GCHQ.

British relations with Russia have plummeted over the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, prompting the UK, US and EU to impose economic sanctions.

Tensions with China, a global superpower, have also heightened in recently over the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, a former British colony.
