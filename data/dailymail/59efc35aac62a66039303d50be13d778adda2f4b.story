A Grinch of a gunman is still on the loose one year after shooting a man dressed as Santa in the back.

Last Christmas Eve, Xavier Hawkins of Washington D.C. put on a Santa suit to hand out toys to needy children at an annual event sponsored by Toys for Tots and his then-employer, Interstate Moving.

He was just approaching the children when, while he was on camera being filmed by a local news station, he was shot in the back with a pellet gun.

Going down: The entire incident was captured by a news crew following him 

Aftermath: Though the pellet gun did not cause physical harm to Hawkins, he suffered from PTSD in the aftermath, and the gunman is still on the loose

Hawkins can then be seen groaning as he falls to the ground, while one child looks on in horror.

Now, Hawkins is telling ABC 7, the news team that was there when this horrific event occurred, how difficult his year has been since this shooting. 

'When I felt the burning, I knew I was shot. That first instinct in my mind before I said anything was I'm going to die,' he said.

And while the physical injuries were manageable for Hawkins, the emotional and psychological ones were not in the aftermath of this incident. 

Back at it: Despite what happened, Hawkins says he will still dress up as Santa this year

'I thought people were out to get me. Why did somebody shoot me? Are they following me?' he said.

He eventually was forced to leave his job, and a doctor diagnosed him with post-traumatic stress disorder.

'I try to think back and look at it and the reality is, I could have been dead,' he said. 

These days, Hawkins is back to volunteering and helping out those less fortunate though, dedicating all his time to helping out st his church and its daycare center.

And he's even getting ready to put the Santa costume back on to pass out gifts at church this year.
