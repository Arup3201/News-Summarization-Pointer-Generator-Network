A transgender student who will soon be legally classified as a man is at war with his Christian college in Oregon, who say they cannot let him live in male dorms because of 'theological commitments'.

The sophomore, who only wants to be identified as Jayce M, has been attempting to establish where he will live next year, having spent this year in female housing.

During that he has completed his sexual transition to become a man, according to KPTV.

'I have the right, as any other male, to live on campus with males,' Jayce told.

Prepared to fight: Jayce M is on a campaign to be allowed to move into the male dorms at George Fox University in Oregon next year. Jayce recently completed his sexual transition to become a man

George Fox University, a Christian college, says they can approve the housing request due to 'theological commitments'

The issue has sparked a big campaign on campus and off, with 14,000 people signing a petition on the housing debate in favor of Jayce

Jayce is hoping to move into the all-male dorms at George Fox University next year

'I'm going to fight for that.'

Jayce is in the process of officially changing his gender on his drivers license and Social Security card, which should be finalized Friday.

In the past week, Jayce's fight has grown to more than 15,000 supporters.

An online petition was started by Jayce's mother, Janice, who said she is trying to ensure her son's safety.

The school has said they are not willing to approve Jayce's request because of their Christian beliefs.

'George Fox strives to be a Christ-centered community, and our residential facilities are single sex because of our theological commitments,' they said in a statement.

'The student's request to switch from female-only on campus housing to male-only on campus housing is one that many institutions would struggle with.'

Jayce's attorney has recently filed a complaint with the Department of Education.

'Because it receives federal money, the university needs to abide by non-discrimination standards,' the attorney, Paul Southwick, said.

George Fox was founded by Quaker pioneers more than 115 years ago. Quaker theology emphasizes social justice and diversity, but the rights of transgender students are still being debated

The college's original decision said Jayce can't live with his male friends on-campus next year; instead, he could live alone in a single room, or live off-campus.

Jayce hopes his fight doesn't have to come to the point of a full investigation.

If it does, he's prepared to see it through.

'I'm hoping that the school will listen and grant me on-campus housing,' he said.

'For the future, I hope that I'll be able to pave the way for future transgender students as well as any other people that are being marginalized.'
