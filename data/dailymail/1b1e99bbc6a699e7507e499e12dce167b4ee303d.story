Russia is now claiming that it was 'American Secret Service agents' who 'kidnapped' a Russian hacker authorities claim stole credit card information out of U.S. computer systems.

Federal prosecutors say the hacker in question, Roman Seleznev, was arrested in Guam this weekend and will be tried in Seattle.

Seleznev was called 'one of the worldâ€™s most
 prolific traffickers of stolen financial information,' by the U.S. Secret Service who claim he is responsible for cyber attacks compromising thousands of credit cards between 2009 and 2011.

Valery Seleznev, a Russian lawmaker from Liberal-Democratic Party and father of Roman Seleznev believes his son was kidnapped by the U.S. over hacking charges to trade for Edward Snowden

ABC News reports that Russian authorities say he was kidnapped and taken to Guam.

Seleznev was 'forcibly put on a plane of a private airline 
company by the American Secret Services and taken to Guam' while returning to Moscow from a vacation in the Maldives, according to the Russians.

'We view this as another unfriendly act by Washington,' the Russian 
statement read.

The statement went on to warn Russian citizens potentially wanted by the U.S. to be careful while traveling abroad.

'Seleznev was arrested by another country at the request of the U.S. 
and was taken into U.S. custody following his expulsion from that 
country, which acted under its own laws,' a spokesman for the U.S. 
Department of Justice told said.

Seleznev's targets allegedly included several small businesses like Broadway Grill, in Seattle, where he could steal credit card information

'He was 
advised of his rights and given consular notification. These actions 
also were in no way inconsistent with any treaty arrangements with 
Russia,' the statement continued, referencing a 1999 agreement for mutual assistance on criminal cases.

The suspect's father is reportedly Valery Seleznyov, who is a member of the country's lower house of Parliament.

In an interview with the Kremlin's propaganda network, RT, he said he believed the U.S. planned to hold his son to arrange a swap with Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia in 2013.

'For all I know they may be demanding a ransom tomorrow. Or try to 
exchange him for Snowden or somebody. One can only wonder,' he 
said.

In 2011, Seleznev was indicted for hacking point-of-sale systems at small restaurants and entertainment venues then selling the credit card information he obtained online.

One alleged target, Broadway Grill, in Seattle, was forced to shut down after tens of thousands of customers had their information exposed.

It's believed he sold stolen data online under the name 'Track 2.'

U.S. security officials allege Seleznev is behind attacks compromising thousands of consumer credit cards

He allegedly earned millions of dollars from such schemes, which are now seen as the precursors to hacks at Neiman Marcus and Target.

The Secret Service has declined to comment on whether he is a suspect in those cases.

Charges include five counts of bank 
fraud, eight counts of intentionally causing damage to a protected 
computer, eight counts of obtaining information form a protected 
computer, one count of possession of 15 or more unauthorized access 
devices, two counts of trafficking unauthorized access devices, and five
 counts of aggravated identity theft.

And in Nevada he faces separate charges for racketeering and two more counts of possessing 15 or more unauthorized access devices.

He faces up to 20 years in prison for the first charge and a maximum of 10 years each for each additional charge.
