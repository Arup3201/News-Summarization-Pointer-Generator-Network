A pensioner who organised a revenge acid attack on his teenage girlfriend after she broke up with him was jailed for 18 years yesterday.

Mohammed Rafiq, 80, paid Steven Holmes £50 to spray a corrosive liquid in the face of Vikki Horsman in April.

The care worker, who was 19 at the time and had coverted to Islam for him, spent five days in intensive care after suffering burns to her face, neck and body.

Rafiq, Holmes and Shannon Heaps, who identified the house in Tividale, West Midlands, where Miss Horsman was staying, were found guilty last week of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Judge Nicholas Webb, sitting at Wolverhampton Crown Court, said the attack was a ‘wicked’ act. Jailing Holmes, 25, for 14 years, he described him as ‘callous and lacking in true remorse’. Heaps, 23, was jailed for 12 years.

Rafiq persuaded the pair to carry out the attack after he became convinced that Miss Horsman had a new boyfriend. Judge Webb told the pensioner: ‘She had decided she didn’t want to continue her relationship with you and you became jealous and angry.

‘You obtained the acid and left it at the front door of the house for Holmes to pick it up and throw.’

He added: ‘Acid attacks are not uncommon in certain parts of the world. Thankfully, they are rare in England. Quite often they are to punish a woman who has refused to bow to the demands of a spouse.

‘In such cases it is done to leave a permanent reminder of what happens when a woman rejects attempts to control her.’

The judge pointed out that Miss Horsman had been vulnerable when she met Rafiq following the death of both her parents.

Speaking of the attack, she said she thought it was ‘the end’ and could feel her skin lifting ‘layer by layer’. She said: ‘I could feel my airways going tight, my lips blistering and just swelling ... agonising pain.’

Doctors told her she faces years of reconstructive surgery.

Rafiq was also convicted of perverting the course of justice after he lied to police and blamed innocent people for the attack.
