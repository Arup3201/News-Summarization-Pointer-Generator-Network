American imports are becoming all too common in Britain these days.

But one Essex couple were shocked to see something far more unusual than a car or a candy bar more than 5,000 miles from its country of origin.

Karen Beckwith saw a huge Harris Hawk, usually seen soaring above woodland in southern California, perched on a neighbour's 4x4.

Bird of prey: The Harris hawk was spotted on a leafy street in Romford, Essex, thousands of miles from home

She spotted the bird, which appeared to have a collar around one foot, on a leafy road next to her street in Romford, on the border between London and Essex, last week.

She immediately sent the pictures to husband Jeff, who rang the RSPB to report the sighting.  

Telecoms technician Jeff, 56, said: 'It was my wife that spotted it and took the pictures.

The bird, which is thought to have escaped from a pest control company, was spotted sat on a Honda CR-V

'I think she only took the pictures because she didn't think I would believe her.

'All the other birds had flown to the uppermost branches and were calling to each other as if they were warning them about the hawk.

'It was such a magnificent sight.'

But as Jeff rang the RSPB, the bird of prey flew away from its perch on top of the Honda CR-V.

An RSPB spokesperson, who believes the bird had escaped from a pest control company, said: 'My advice is just to leave the bird alone and don't feed it because eventually they will find their way back to their owners.

'People with pets shouldn't be concerned.'

Harris Hawks have a whopping wingspan of around 48 inches, and can take down prey more than three times their 1.5lb weight.

Named after 19th-century US naturalist Edward Harris, the hawks can have a wingspan of up to 5ft, with females about a third larger than males.

Found in southwestern United States and parts of South America, including Chile and Argentina, other names for Harris hawks include Dusky hawk and Bay-winged hawk,

They can be identified by their dark brown and chestnut plumage and white-tipped tails.  

They are nicknamed the 'wolves of the sky' because they hunt in ‘packs’, which allows them to catch larger prey, usually in sparse habitats, such as desert, woodlands and marshlands.

They eat rabbits, rats and birds but are themselves hunted by great horned owls.

The oldest recorded life span of a wild Harris hawk is 12 years and seven months but this can increase to 25 years in captivity. 

Although sometimes spotted in Britain, these have most likely escaped from captivity as the species is one of the most popular for falconry. This is because they are one of the easiest species to train.

A £60,000 Harris hawk was used to rid London's Trafalgar Square of its unwanted pigeon population.
