The first real rain of the Test summer forced England into Old Trafford’s indoor nets temporarily on Wednesday where the sound of the Pharrell Williams anthem Happy was blaring out while they went about their business ahead of the fourth Test.

Certainly the comprehensive win in Southampton and the subsequent clearing of Jimmy Anderson of ‘abusing and pushing’ Ravindra Jadeja has put smiles back on the faces of England’s players after nearly a year of abject misery.

Even Anderson was ‘less grumpy’ than usual, according to Alastair Cook, and the man who is poised to become England’s leading Test wicket-taker will take to his home ground without the shadow of suspension hanging over him.

Spring in his step: Jimmy Anderson is raring to go on his home ground of Old Trafford

India were starting to resemble Monty Python’s Black Knight by refusing to give up on getting Anderson banned until ICC chief executive Dave Richardson, thankfully, stood up to them and confirmed there would be no appeal.

The end of the matter? Well, all eyes will be on Anderson in this pivotal match to see whether ‘James’ again allows his alter ego ‘Jimmy’ out of his Burnley attic and unleashes him on the sensitive souls in the Indian team.

Richardson made a point yesterday of warning against ‘personal’ sledging; pointing out to MS Dhoni that he may have put on a pound or two of weight, or words to that effect, are the type of verbals that Anderson must cut out.

What Cook has to ensure is that the leader of his attack can summon the aggression which has helped take him to within 12 wickets of Sir Ian Botham’s England record without crossing the line that he often dangerously treads.

Time to shine: Peter Moores speaks to the England squad ahead of the fourth Test

Two productive matches for Anderson here and at The Oval next week should be enough to see that record broken and a series victory for an England side who are now seeking to replicate their near complete third Test display.

The England captain was adamant hat he has no problem with Anderson’s conduct and that he does not want the leader of his attack to become all ‘nicey nicey’, which is something he has never been accused of.

Old Trafford, where England last year retained the Ashes before their world fell apart, is set to provide the quickest, bounciest pitch of this Investec series and Anderson was desperate to be available to try to exploit it.

‘For him to be playing here means a lot,’ said Cook. ‘That’s what the biggest concern was — that he wouldn’t get to play at Old Trafford. Now he can play in a home Test, which I know is special to everyone who does that. Unfortunately we don’t play Test cricket at Chelmsford, so I don’t think I’ll ever experience that.’

England plan to field the same side who ended their 10-Test winless run, meaning that Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes get another chance to support Anderson and Stuart Broad with the wickets that eluded them in Southampton.

‘You always try to pick the best team but you have to also consider continuity,’ said Cook. ‘You don’t want guys in the team always looking over their shoulder. The most successful sides are built on stability.’

There must have been a temptation for England to throw Steven Finn, who has looked back to his old self in the Old Trafford nets, into the fray but they are right not to jettison Jordan on the back of one indifferent match.

In good spirits: The England team looked to be enjoying themselves as they prepared for the Old Trafford

Jordan was superb at Old Trafford in the one-day victory over Sri Lanka earlier this season and seems to have suffered for being dropped after two Tests against Sri Lanka in the clamour to re introduce Ben Stokes.

England have to be careful they do not return to the days of too much chopping and changing and both Jordan and Woakes, who bowled well without luck at the Ageas Bowl, will now get the opportunity to settle in at the highest level.

It seems certain that Broad will have the operation on his damaged right knee that has long looked necessary at the end of this series but he will not want to stand down just yet after returning, like Anderson, to his best last week. Both have mediocre records at Old Trafford and will want to improve them now.

The senior players had been the problem for England up until now but with Cook, Anderson, Broad and Ian Bell all leading the way in Southampton the ‘new era’ suddenly has a much more positive feel about it. Not least for the captain.

‘It was great I scored runs last week and it was a big weight off my shoulders but it was only one game,’ said Cook. ‘I’m thinking of my batting the same way we’re approaching this match as a team. Last week counts for nothing.’

It is the way it has to be for England until they consistently get back to winning ways but they will never have a better chance of defeating an India side who travel so badly and rarely undertake five-Test series.

Dhoni and his team looked sluggish in fielding practice yesterday, only livening up for the game of football they use as part of their warm-up that Dhoni in particular loves. ‘I’m missing my soccer for this,’ the ardent Manchester United fan was heard to say as he left his press conference yesterday.

So Dhoni got to play football at Old Trafford — except it was the wrong Old Trafford. It is how one of the few cricketers who earns Premier League wages plays cricket here, as he faces up to a vindicated Jimmy Anderson, that will matter. And whether they exchange the odd word or two.
