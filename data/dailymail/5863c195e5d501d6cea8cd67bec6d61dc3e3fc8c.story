A medical professional has insisted states in Australia  take immediate action to ban tanning beds in a bid to slash cancer rates.

Written in a letter, the president for the Australian Medical Association Dr Michael Gannon said Western Australia was 'embarrassingly' falling behind other states who are banning the cancer causing beds from January 1 2015.

He said solariums 'do not have a positive role in our society' and should therefore be banned.

Dr Gannon criticises the Western Australian Health Minister Kim Hames, labelling her leadership as lacking and  said it is 'inexcusable' when it comes to such an important issue.

He said once solarium tanning is banned in all other states Western Australia could be seen as a 'solarium tourism' destination for regular tanners. 

Opposition health spokesman Roger Cook agreed with Dr Gannon's letter stating the Western Australian government has failed to combat an issue that if passed could lead to a reduction in skin cancer diagnosis.

'The Barnett Government has fundamentally failed to provide leadership on the issue of banning sunbeds,' Mr Cook said. 

'The letter is a sign of desperation from the medical community.' 

Dr Gannon said tanning beds 'deliver six times the radiation of the midday sun' and show a clear link to 'skin cancer and death from skin cancer.' 

'We have got a Minister who says they should be banned and yet we are lagging behind the rest of the country.' 

The letter comes as WA's Labor government has vowed to introduce laws to ban solariums from January 1.

But banning tanning beds are not as easy as it seems with fears it could lead to unregulated home use.

'There is going to be a lot of people who will either be buying their own or looking for a friend of a friend who has got one. That's a real worry because they won't be trained,' a Perth solarium owner told perthnow.com.au.

The solarium owner said the business sees about 100 clients a day and if a ban is to go ahead compensation for hundreds of thousands of dollars is expected. 

Skin cancer is responsible for more than 2,000 deaths and 80 per cent of all new cancer diagnoses, which costs the health system around $3 million.
