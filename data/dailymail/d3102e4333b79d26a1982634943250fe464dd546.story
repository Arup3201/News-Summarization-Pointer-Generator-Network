Ministers are trying to measure loneliness amid concerns it is having devastating consequences on the nation’s health.

The Department of Health is drawing up a map which will pinpoint which areas of the country have the highest levels of isolation.

It is a particular problem among the elderly and research has found that as many as half of the over 75s regard the television as their main source of company.

Figures show that 1 in 10 elderly people only see friends and family once a month, with the same proportion saying they feel cut-off from society

But there is growing evidence that loneliness can cause health problems and lead to higher rates of dementia, heart disease and high blood pressure.

It also leads to people going to their hospital or GP more frequently - just for the company - and they are more likely to move into a care home earlier.

For the first time, officials will ask local councils and NHS health trusts to carry out surveys of the levels of loneliness within their communities. If they are found to be high, authorities will be urged to provide extra support such as befriending services and transport to day centres.

Norman Lamb, the care and support minister said: ‘For the first time we will be aiming to define the extent of the problem by introducing a national measure for loneliness.

‘We will be encouraging local authorities, NHS organisations and others to get better at measuring the condition in their communities.

‘Once they have this information, they can come up with the right solutions to address loneliness and isolation.’

The charity Age UK estimates that as many as 1 in 10 pensioners are lonely most of the time, which equates to 90,000 people.

Another 1 in 10 only see friends and family once a month, with the same proportion saying they feel cut-off from society.

Laura Ferguson, Director of the Campaign to End Loneliness - which was set up by charities last year said: ‘Loneliness is a major health issue.

‘An effective measure of isolation and loneliness is an important step to improving the lives of the hundreds of thousands of older people who are chronically lonely.

‘This national measure can only help those making local health and care decisions to prioritise loneliness as a health issue, and one that they will tackle.’

The campaign says being lonely is linked to high blood pressure and depression and has been shown to increase the risk of dementia by 50 per cent.

Dr Anne Hayden, a GP in Dorset, said she trimmed £80,000 from the NHS’s budget by setting up a befriending scheme for elderly patients who frequently came to the surgery.

The patients did not have any obvious symptoms and doctors suspected that they were lonely and felt unable to cope with life.

As part of the scheme, volunteers visit the patients and help out with jobs around the home as well as offering advice and support.
