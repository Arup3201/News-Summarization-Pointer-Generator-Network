The two muddy patches at the side of the street were crying out for a little love and attention.

So when GP Susannah Beattie spent her own time and money making them look attractive by planting some shrubs, neighbours were delighted.

But days later a letter arrived from the council saying the work had been done without its approval.

'Licence to cultivate': Angry GP Susannah Beattie and local councillor Geoff Heathcock by the spruced up muddy verge in Cambridge with the small number of plants she put in, in front of them

Dr Beattie, 47, was told she had to apply for a ‘licence to cultivate’ – a process that involved submitting a detailed plan and paying an £84 fee.

She reluctantly agreed to the demand but yesterday criticised the ‘tick-box culture’ that threatens to stifle public-spirited behaviour.

Dr Beattie, who was yesterday resigned to paying the fee, has demanded a rethink on the 30-year-old rules she claims leave no room for common sense.

'It doesn’t make sense to be discouraging the local community from beautifying the neighbourhood,' she said.

Dr Beattie planted the greenery on council-owned land at the end of her driveway in Cambridge in the last week of September.

The land on each side had been churned up into a muddy mess by residents and visitors to a nearby GP surgery as they parked their cars.

Grateful neighbours commented on how lovely it looked after Dr Beattie’s efforts.

Dismal: The GP put in a measly number of shrubs into this bed, and one across the road from it, to stop illegal parkers and make her area look nicer, but Cambridgeshire County Council say she has broken the law and must pay £84 to them

But on October 10, a letter from Cambridgeshire County Council arrived saying she had breached the 1980 Highways Act, under which local authorities control planting on public land. In the plan she had to submit, Dr Beattie explained how the planting ‘replaced a weedy, bald area of ground’.

Letters outlined what greenery had been planted and where – including lily of the valley bush and hardy geranium. The council’s highways department has now approved her application.

Local councillor Geoff Heathcock said no one who tries to improve their neighbourhood should be treated like a criminal.

He added: ‘This action is both unnecessary and petty compared to the damage that is done all year round by parking on verges.’

The council insisted the application for a licence was standard practice. A spokesman said: ‘The fee covers the cost of inspecting the site and agreeing a planting scheme.’
