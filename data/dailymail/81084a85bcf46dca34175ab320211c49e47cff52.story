Belgian politicians will vote today on plans to extend euthanasia to extremely sick children with their parents' consent.

If they back the proposed new bill, Belgium will be a step closer to becoming the first country to remove the age limit for euthanasia.

However, it would insist that parents have a role in their child's decision to die.

Jean-Jacques De Gucht, from the 
Flemish liberals, who form part of the ruling coalition, said: 'We want 
to provide the freedom of choice, also to minors who are able to make up
 their own mind.'

Today's
 senate panel will vote whether to support the bill allowing the killing
 of a young patient suffering from an extreme condition, and pass the 
legislation on to parliament.

The committee will not have the power to make the bill law.

But
 the panel's backing would be an important move in that direction as the
 committee shares the same political makeup as the broader parliament.

Backers
 say the law would give a merciful way out for youngsters suffering from
 debilitating conditions, and legalise a practice that they say is 
already going on in secret.

'Imagine
 a cancer or leukaemia patient, a child whom we have already treated for
 eight years and in which we reach a stage where we know there is 
nothing more that we can do to cure him,' said Marc Cosyns, lecturer of 
medical ethics at Ghent University.

Opponents to the plans say it will open the door to infanticide and argue children are too young to make such a decision

Opponents say it would open the door to infanticide and leave the ultimate decision in the hands of someone too young to make it. Euthanasia is outlawed altogether in most countries.

'Once the possibility for euthanasia exists for children, demand is likely to rise. It's clear among adults that it is difficult to keep euthanasia within limits once the taboo of killing has fallen,' said oncologist Benoit Beuselinck, founder of euthanasiestop.be.

Some religious groups have also come out against the legislation.

Belgium's
 neighbour the Netherlands already lets terminally ill children seek 
euthanasia. But the age limit is 12, and anyone aged up to 16 has to get
 full parental consent.

Analysts
 said there was a good chance the bill would get backing from the 
senate's joint justice and social affairs panel, as it had already been 
proposed by members of the Flemish and Walloon arms of the coalitions 
liberal and socialist parties.

The
 third coalition partner, the Christian Democrats, has acknowledged 
there is a broad political consensus to extend euthanasia to minors, but
 is pushing for a minimum age limit of 15 and tighter rules on medical 
panels reviewing euthanasia requests.

'In matters of life and death it is no mistake to think a bit longer about the law we are creating,' said senator Els Van Hoof, of the Flemish Christian Democrats.

The proposed law already says children choosing to die would have to be of 'sound mind and judgement', effectively ruling out infants.

Dutch data suggest youngsters make up just a tiny fraction of people seeking euthanasia. Only five minors requested it between 2002 and 2013, only one of them under 16.

Belgium is already seen as one of the world's most liberal countries when it comes to euthanasia, and allows it for people who are not terminally ill
