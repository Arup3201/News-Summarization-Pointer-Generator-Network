A self-proclaimed spiritual healer, who was charged with sexual and indecent assault offences earlier this year, has had another 40 offences added to his name. 

Mohammad Hassan Manteghi, 49, also known as Man Monis, appeared in court in April on one count of sexual intercourse without consent and two counts of indecent assault, where he was refused bail.

It's alleged Mr Manteghi, who claims to be a spiritual healer, advised a 27-year-old woman in 2002 to visit him at his business in Wentworthville in Sydney's west after she contacted him through a 'Spiritual Consultation' ad in a community newspaper.

A self-proclaimed 'spiritual healer' is facing another 40 sex crime charges 

The woman was indecently assaulted during her first consultation with Manteghi in August 2002.

A week later at their next meeting, the woman was allegedly sexually assaulted.

The state's sex crime squad has been investigating and officers charged Manteghi at his appearance at Penrith Local Court on Friday with fresh offences.

They include 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault.

The new offences were allegedly committed against six additional women, all of whom visited the man when he was offering services as a 'spiritual healer'.

He has been granted bail and is next due to appear in court in February.
