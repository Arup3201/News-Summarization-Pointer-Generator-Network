This is the heart-in-mouth moment an amateur stuntman found himself stranded 70ft above St Petersburg's busiest street.

Gogulan Pvel, 24, got trapped half way across Nevsky Prospekt as he attempted to pull himself along a 60-metre-long power cable.

The Russian daredevil - who was not wearing a safety harness or helmet - was in so much bother during the stunt that at one point he was hanging on with just an elbow and a leg.

In trouble: The intrepid daredevil, without a safety harness and helmet, hangs on with just an elbow and a leg

However, Pvel - who fortunately 
managed to hoist himself to safety - was quick to quash suggestions that
 the stunt had been a failure.

'I wanted to do it after a rival did the same thing,' he explained.

'He only made it a third of the way, but I have managed half. Next time, I will go the whole way.'

Bystanders watched the drama unfold with horror from below.

This really isn't funny anymore: 'It looked like at any moment he would lose his grip,' said a bystander

Witness Anton Shubin said: 'He seemed to 
be in real trouble. The only special clothing he had were some gloves 
which he pulled off and threw away.'

'He was going hand by hand, move by move. It looked like at at any moment he would lose his grip,' added another passer-by.

'I thought he was going to be stuck there until he ran out of strength and fell.'

Almost there: The daredevil hoists himself back to safety, while a man watches on

I'll be back: Pvel has vowed to return and successfully complete the stunt in the future

Pvel has refused to be discouraged and vowed to successfully complete the stunt in the future.

'I'll be back and next time I'll do the whole street,' he said. 'I lost my concentration this time, but next time I'll go all the way.'
