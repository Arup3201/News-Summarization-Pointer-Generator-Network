U.S. officials have warned Google and 
Apple of privacy concerns as the companies fly 'military-grade spy 
planes' over cities to gather data for 3D map services.

Staffers for Senator Charles Schumer, a
Democrat from New York, met with Google executives on Monday to discuss
privacy issues related to the camera-equipped planes.

They plan to meet with Apple on 
Friday. The senator's office also plans to reach out to Microsoft and 
other companies that may be developing similar technologies.

Privacy concerns: Google now has camera planes which have taken images like this of San Francisco

Senator Schumer said he wanted to make
sure the companies 'understand the significance of our concerns over 
the potential publication of images captured in people's backyards and 
other private settings.'

The lawmaker wrote to the rival 
Silicon Valley corporations on Monday accusing them of 'an unprecedented
invasion of privacy' by using technology capable of imaging objects as 
small as 4in.

In his letter, Senator Schumer raised 
concerns over Apple's and Google's reported 'digital mapping plans that 
use military-grade spy planes with enough precision to see through 
windows, catch detailed images of private backyard activities, and 
record images as small as four inches.'

Google and Apple each unveiled new 3D 
mapping services this month at separate events. The maps let users 
navigate around an aerial view of a city that appears much more 
realistic than the flat, top-down satellite-based images currently 
available.

The two companies are racing to 
complete the new maps which will be a key feature as they compete to 
attract users to their rival smartphone offerings.

Big brother: Google and Apple have been warned about the potential for breaching privacy with their maps

Google said in a statement it does not
currently blur aerial imagery taken by the camera-equipped planes 
because the resolution of the images isn't sharp enough 'for it to be a 
concern.'

The company added that it takes privacy 'very seriously.'

Appleâ€™s spy planes are believed to be equipped with technology developed by defence agencies to guide missile strikes.

Each
plane is equipped with multiple cameras taking high-resolution 
photographs of buildings and landmarks from every possible angle, which 
are then compiled to make three-dimensional images.

The military-grade images are taken 
at a height of around 1,600ft, meaning people below are very unlikely to
realise they are being photographed.

The
cameras can be installed on planes, helicopters or even unmanned 
drones, although there are safety restrictions about the use of the 
latter in Britain.

A small plane carrying the cameras can photograph up to 100 square kilometres (38.6 square miles) every hour.

Apple said it does not display 
personally identifiable details such as faces or license plates, and 
that 'we create optimised pictures taken from multiple shots and remove 
moving objects such as cars and people from the final image.'

By the end of the year, Google said it
expects to have 3D map coverage for metropolitan areas with a combined 
population of 300million people.

At an event demonstrating the new maps
this month, Google said it was using a fleet of airplanes owned and 
operated by contractors but flying exclusively for Google.

Equipped with custom-designed cameras,
the planes fly in 'a very tightly controlled pattern' over metropolitan
areas, taking pictures from 45-degree angles, Google executives 
explained.

The photographs are then used to build 3D computer-generated models of the buildings and cityscapes.

Google has used planes to collect 
aerial photos in the past, such as following the 2010 San Bruno, 
California, gas-line explosion. But the latest effort marks the 
company's most significant use of the planes in a systematic manner to 
build a standard feature in one of its products.

You are being watched: Street View-style maps are already controversial thanks to Google's data harvesting

Google has faced scrutiny over mapping
services in the past, such as with the camera-equipped 'Street View' 
cars that crisscross the globe taking panoramic pictures of streets for 
its popular mapping service.

In 2010, Google acknowledged that the 
so-called Street View cars had collected emails, passwords and other 
personal data from home wireless networks.

Collecting the WiFi data was unrelated
to the Google Maps project; it was done so that Google could collect 
data on WiFi hot spots that can be used to provide separate 
location-based services, executives said.
