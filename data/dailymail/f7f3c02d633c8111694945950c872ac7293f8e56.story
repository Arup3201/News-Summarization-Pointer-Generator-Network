Founder of Bobbi Bear Jackie Branfield launched her charity in 1992 after realizing how difficult it was for child victims of sex abuse to report their crimes.

Every fourth girl under the age of 16 is raped in the South African Province of Kwa-Zulu Natal, for example, and all too often, victims are afraid to tell police about it.

Furthermore, it is estimated that 51per cent of all adults in the region between the ages of 16 and 45 are HIV positive.

Since most sexual offenders are in this age-group, the chances of them infecting their victims is high.

As many of these crimes go un-reported, Ms Branfield needed to find a way to get children to open up about their ordeals, so that more perpetrators could be brought to justice.

She found her answer in Bobbi the stuffed bear. By communicating directly with the teddy, she learned that children could better speak about their abuse.

Specific details about the crimes are written or drawn onto the bear by the children, and its use has been approved at court; ultimately leading to more convictions.

The celebrities who signed up to decorate their own bears for the upcoming auction produced a league of very unique offerings.
