A Czech policeman trying to shoot a dog that had attacked him, missed the animal and killed its owner.

The unnamed police officer accidentally shot the 23-year-old dog-owner in the head, killing him instantly.

The incident happened in town of Prerov in the eastern Czech Republic after local police had been sent to stop a punch-up outside a bar.

Crime scene: This is the location in Prerov, Czech Republic, where the dog owner was accidentally shot dead

Vigil: Candles have been lit for the 23-year-old, whose dog was attacking another man when police arrived

Resolution: Officers at the scene unsuccessfully tried to calm the aggressive situation between the two men

When the officers arrived at the bar in the town centre, they initially tried to calm the group intoxicated men, but the attempt proved unsuccessful, a police spokesperson said.

'The police officers were threatened by the dog, and so they used their service pistols to defend themselves,' police spokesperson Marta Vlachova said.

A witness who did not wish to be named told local TV: 'The policeman who was trying to calm down the person involved in the fight and was attacked by the dog which was protecting its owner. 

'The dog wasn't on a dog lead at the time.

'The police officer didn't shoot the dog immediately, but after it had repeatedly attacked him he was forced to take out his gun and it was clear he wanted to shoot the dog. But the bullet accidentally hit the owner of the dog.' 

Another witness told local news website Nejlepsi-adresa.cz: 'Before midnight in front of the bar Lumir, about ten to 15 drunk people started to fight. We were watching it from our window.

'The dog was involved in the fighting, it seemed to be trying to pull its owner out of the mass of fighting men. He wasn't doing anything to stop it biting people.

'The people were shouting and beating each other. Because the fight lasted too long, my mother called the police.'

According to the witness, two police cars arrived there about five minutes later and the policemen had talked to the troublemakers.

The witness says he saw the dog running towards the policeman after which he heard one shot go off, and the animal's owner fell to the ground.

Police spokesperson Vlachova confirmed the incident, but was not able to ive any further information about the case.
