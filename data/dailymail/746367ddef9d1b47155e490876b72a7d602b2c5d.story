Neil Lennon was unveiled as Bolton’s new manager on Monday and admitted he was growing frustrated waiting to be offered a route back into management following his success at Celtic.

The 43-year-old Irishman won three league titles and two Scottish Cups during his four-year spell in charge at Parkhead and also guided Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League in 2012 on the back of a stunning home win over Barcelona.

Losses: 39 

After quitting in May to pursue other opportunities, however, Lennon has missed out on the managerial vacancies at Southampton, Crystal Palace, Norwich, Cardiff and Leeds. He withdrew from the running to take over at Huddersfield Town and would have held talks with Saudi Arabian club Al Ittihad had visa issues not prevented him from travelling.

When it was suggested yesterday his achievements at Celtic, particularly in the Champions League, deserved more recognition, he replied: ‘You should tell that to some of the Premier League chairmen!

‘Maybe it (Scottish football) is looked down upon a little bit but we did some great things in the Champions League. 

The Scot, talking to the press on Monday, has a huge task at Bolton but is relishing the tough challenge ahead

Bolton are currently rooted to the bottom of the Championship but will hope Lennon can turn around results

‘You do get a bit antsy when jobs are coming up and they pass you by. You’re thinking, “I don’t want to leave it too much longer”. I’ve been lucky in that it’s just been six months. But sooner or later it’s in your blood and you want to get back.’

Lennon accepted the offer of a three-year deal worth £600,000-a-year to succeed Dougie Freedman at Bolton, who are bottom of the Championship with just one win from 11 games. Since dropping out of the Premier League in 2012, the club’s debts have risen to £163.8million and there will not be much money to strengthen the squad.

Lennon insists plenty of prominent managers have had to prove themselves in the Championship.

‘Look at the Premier League now. You’ve got Brendan Rodgers, Roberto Martinez, Paul Lambert, Steve Bruce — the list is endless of managers who have managed in the Championship. You probably have to earn your spurs to get there.’

Lennon (left) stamped his mark on his squad by ordering three players to remove hats during his first training session. He ended up wearing Owen Garvan’s hat himself.

‘I was cold, yeah, but I don’t want players training in hats because you don’t play in hats,’ said Lennon. ‘I’m not a bully, I’m not a dictator. But I will demand they come in and train and do things the right way.’
