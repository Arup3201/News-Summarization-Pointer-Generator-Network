He said: 'My dad always had an interest in trucks and he transferred his knowledge and interest to me.

'I chose matches to create the models because my uncle in the army made some models, from matchsticks so I wanted to do the same.

'The first truck I made was a GAZ 63a, this truck is took a lot of effort, but that effort has finally paid off.

'To create one model it takes at least 20 9-12 hour days. Most of my models are developed within 20-100 days, it all depends on the size.
