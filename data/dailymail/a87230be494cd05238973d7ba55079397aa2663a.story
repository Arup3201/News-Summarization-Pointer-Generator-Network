A building society manager has been jailed for four years after robbing her own husband and family’s accounts of more than £300,000 to pay off debts.

Mother-of-two Denise Salter worked her way up from part-time clerk to become manager of the Sheffield branch of the Yorkshire Building Society.

She used her financial know-how to withdraw funds over 17 years and when arrested by police frankly confessed: 'I’m a thief and a liar.'

Her family’s cottage home has been put up for sale and her husband Charles, himself a victim, is now faced with paying off a mortgage he didn’t know he had.

Sheffield Crown Court heard 57-year-old Salter had stolen the money to pay off debts run up by her two sons and cover household expenditure and bills.

She admitted six offences of theft, two of fraud, one each of false accounting and making a false instrument and asked for three further theft matters to be considered from December, 1995 to July, 2012.

Laura Marshall, prosecuting, said her offending came to light when lifelong friend Joan Shepherd discovered her investment account had been closed and all the money withdrawn.

Each staff member has a unique access number and it was traced to Salter. Other accounts were checked higher up and further anomalies were found.

'Each of the accounts affected related to close family or friends of the defendant,' said Miss Marshall. 'The prosecution say there was a deliberate targeting of these accounts. She felt she was able to control the accounts because of the relationship she had with the complainants.'

In total Salter stole £325,411 and the overall losses to the building society were £366,682. The society has compensated all of the victims but is now taking civil action to claim Salter’s pension to recoup its losses.

Salter initially stole £8,000 in 1993 from a joint account between her husband, a maintenance fitter, and their elder son David who is now in his thirties.

She took £55,000 in 1996 from the estate of dementia sufferer Gwendoline Chappell who was in her 80s and died a year later. Her daughter Lynn said two of her three sons had received little out of the £20,000 they each expected to receive in savings bonds.

Salter raided a joint account between her husband and their younger son Michael for £6,800 in 1998.

Over a seven-year period from 2001 she robbed Stephen and Lisa Moxon of £43,740. Salter is the godmother of their daughter Chloe.

The Moxons thought their investment by 2008 should have been worth about £73,000 but Salter had withdrawn the cash. Salter also stole £35,625 the Moxons took out in a savings bond in 2006.

Salter then falsified a mortgage application in the sum of £58,000 for her husband in 2003 by forging his signature. 'He left all financial matters to his wife and believed his mortgage had been paid off in full,' said Miss Marshall.

It has left Charles Salter with a £150,000 mortgage still to pay off on the family home at Pilley, near Barnsley.

Salter fraudulently made a mortgage application for her parents-in-law Tom and Margaret Salter for £12,500 in 2007.

The next year she stole £2,000 from her husband’s ISA savings account and later made another false mortgage application for £4,500 in her parents-in-laws’ name.

Salter took a further £35,000 from the account of Linda Hall, daughter of Joan Shepherd, and £30,000 from Mrs Shepherd by setting up a false account in her name.

A further £2,200 was stolen from the Moxon family’s account in 2012. They had given Salter a host of £1 coins to deposit but the money was never put in.

The court heard that Michael Salter had been given about £50,000 by his mother and Daniel about £60,000 when they ran into financial trouble.

When arrested, Salter told police she had been helping her sons with their cash problems. 'She spoke of taking her own life to allow the victims to be repaid from insurance,' said Miss Marshall.

Rick Holland, for Salter, said she recognised the 'enormous hurt' she had been responsible for and the victims were disappointed and upset at her thieving.

'Her family and friends sit in the public gallery and they have lost a considerable amount of money,' he said. 'She has caused a great deal of distress to those who trusted her. It is hard for her to accept she has caused so much misery in her family.'

He said she was doing her best to help her sons and they too along with her husband had become victims.

Judge Paul Watson said Salter betrayed the trust of her family and friends. He was satisfied the remorse she felt was genuine although it could not repair the trust they had put in her. 'You will not be able to look members of your family in the eye again,' he said.

Afterwards Det Sgt Karl Saxton who led the police inquiry said: 'She just accumulated lots of debts including credit card debts and the money was used to pay off those debts. The family didn’t live an extravagant lifestyle.

'She used part of the money to help her sons and pay off their debts but it is still a mystery where the rest of the money went. There were home improvements and a caravan but she took out loans to pay for that.

'She just didn’t have enough legitimate income to pay off the debts that were accumulated and needed the extra money to maintain her lifestyle. There are a lot of people who have been betrayed.

'The victims feel she has taken advantage of them. Some were too upset to come to court. Her husband is devastated. He’s a victim like everyone else and has been saddled with a substantial debt.'
