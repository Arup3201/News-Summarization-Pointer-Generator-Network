Panamanian investigators and FBI agents searched a hostel in Panama Friday for blood traces or other signs of a California woman last seen there several months ago, an official said.

Searches on land and by divers off the coast have turned up no sign of Yvonne Baldelli, 42, of Laguna Niguel, California, whose family reported her missing in January.

Panamanian police investigator Alexis Munoz said that his officers, FBI agents and forensic specialists were using a chemical that could reveal signs of blood on the walls and floor of the hostel El Sapo, in the Bocas del Toro archipelago, a popular tourist spot where Ms Baldelli was last seen on November 26.

She was seen with an American 
boyfriend, who left for Costa Rica days later and has since returned to 
the U.S., according to Munoz.

Authorities said they were looking for signs that Ms Baldelli may have been a victim of violence in the hotel.

Ms Baldelli and her partner stayed at 
the two-story hostel for about two months. Munoz said Ms Baldelli's family 
had lost any contact with her at the end of November, 'which makes us 
think that there may have been some crime against her.'

The pair rented an apartment together on the Panamanian island of Carenero and Mr Brimager, a former marine, played guitar in local bars.

Ms Baldelli's parents last heard from her by email in the end of November, but then nothing since.

Mr Brimager said that she had run away to Costa Rica and taken up with another man, but her passport records do not register any travel to the neighboring country.

Her family became concerned when Mr Brimager stopped answering their calls and returned to California in December, shortly after her disappearance.

Her sister Michelle Valenzuela said that she sensed that something bad was going to happen when she sister headed off to Panama, telling CBS that she had an 'ominous' feeling.

Aside from her senses, the first tangible clue they had was when the weekly emails stopped coming.

Fox News Latino cites police sources that say the couple had a violent relationship during their time in Panama and have suggested that the possibility of a crime of passion has not been ruled out.

Another unusual move by Mr Brimager was to become engaged and marry another woman in the months immediately following his girlfriend's disappearance.

Mr Brimager has since taken down his Facebook page, and neither he nor his new wife are responding to press calls.

Since the declaration of him as a formal 'person of interest', the FBI announced that much of their investigation will take place in the U.S. That said, they will also be sending divers down to Panama to search the area around the home where Ms Baldelli and Mr Brimager lived.

Some of her relatives flew to Panama to look for her in January after she did not respond to emails about a planned family reunion.

Local investigations have turned up no solid clues about Ms Baldelli's whereabouts, or the location of her dog named Georgia May.

Her family launched an effort to enlist local volunteers to search via Facebook, and the FBI has since become involved in the case.

FBI investigators are also officially looking into Mr Brimager and his connection to the case.

'What we want is to bring Yvonne home and show that she's loved and cared about,' her father James Faust said.
