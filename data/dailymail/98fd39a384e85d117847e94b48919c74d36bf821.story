The 103-year-old campaigner and inspiration behind civil rights film Selma has spoken of the savage beating she received that became the iconic image of police brutality at the time.

Amelia Boynton Robinson said she 'froze' after seeing Alabama state troopers on horseback riding towards protesters with batons and gas masks in scenes that shocked the world.

After being struck repeatedly, she lost consciousness - and the harrowing image of the 52-year-old widow in the arms of a fellow protester helped secure voting reform in the state for black people.

Seen around the world: Amelia Boynton Robinson is held after being violently beaten by Alabama State Troopers during an attempted protest march from Selma to Alabama's state capital ­Montgomery

On March 7, 1965, Ms Boynton Robinson and 600 others attempted to march from the town of Selma to Alabama's capital ­Montgomery.

They were protesting the fact that African Americans were being denied the right to vote in the state.

The monumental event has now been immortalised on the big screen with a highly-acclaimed new movie Selma - about Martin Luther King's civil rights movement.

Ms Boynton Robinson, whoo has campaigned for equality all of her life, believes the timing of the film's release is fitting as protests continue in America over the killings of black men by police officers.

Speaking to The Sunday Mirror about the moment protesters were charged, she said: 'I think I was frozen. It was not because of fear. It was ­amazement, of people being beaten. 

'I saw blood on the highway, I saw people falling. An officer on horseback hit me across the back of the shoulders and on the back of the neck. I lost consciousness.'

She later added: 'It's ­important that young people know about the struggles we faced to get to the point we are at today. Only then will they ­appreciate the hard-won freedom of blacks in this country.'

Ms Boynton Robinson was raised in a time when black Americans were prohibited from sitting near the front on buses for from drinking from 'white' water ­fountains. 

Addressing the shameful period in American history, Selma is now a favourite for best film at the Oscars on February 22.

It has also been nominated for four Golden Globes, including a best actor nod for British star David Oyelowo as Dr King, 

Released in the UK on Friday, the film focuses on what became known as Bloody Sunday, and two other marches - organised around Ms Boynton Robinson's kitchen table in Selma.

At the time of the real event, segregation laws in the Deep South meant it was even illegal for more than two black people to congregate in the street. 

Of the 30,000 people who lived in Selma, half were black - but only 156 could vote because of the ridiculous red tape set in place by the state.

Ms Boynton Robinson was one of the first lack people to vote in 1932 after passing literacy tests and paying fees beyond the reach of many people.

After campaigning to change the prejudiced local voting rules, she came to the attention of Dr King and other national civil rights leaders.

Like Dr King, she advocated non-violent acts of civil disobedience and when she set off at the head of the march she says she was 'not looking for notoriety.'

She vividly recalls the line of police waiting for them on a bridge ad recalls being hit across her shoulders, back and neck with a police baton before losing consciousness.

She was left for dead by police officers who pumped tear gas into her eyes and throat - before being dragged to an ambulance by a young stranger. 

After discharging herself from hospital two days later she joined Dr King on a second march to Montgomery and soon discovered her face had been seen around the world.
