Luiz Felipe Scolari delivered a stirring speech on the eve of the World Cup, declaring: ‘To all Brazilians, I want to say that the time has arrived. This is our World Cup.’

It was quite a statement of intent for a Brazil coach who has already publicly declared his belief that his team will win this tournament and so enable him to celebrate a second World Cup triumph in charge of the national team.

But there was also an emotive speech in response to a question about the death of his nephew, who was killed in a car accident on Tuesday.

‘We have gone through difficult times

that life goes and each one has a path to follow. I find my strength 
form working with these players. Even when we are feeling sad we can 
forget the sadness and see the beauty around us.’

Scolari
 was joined in Wednesday night’s press conference at the Arena De Sao Paulo 
by Brazil’s superstar, Neymar. He was reminded that not since Rivaldo in
 2002 has Brazil’s No 10 scored at a World Cup.

Neymar
 echoed his coach. ‘As Mr Scolari said, the time has arrived,’ he said. 
‘All Brazilians, the whole world is waiting for this moment.

Weight of a nation: Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari speaks with Luiz and Paulinho ahead of their Cup opener

Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has decided to stay with Brazil's national team despite the death of his nephew in an accident two days before the opening match of the World Cup.

Scolari attended the official FIFA press conference in Sao Paulo on Wednesday and did not travel to be with his family in southern Brazil, where 48-year-old Tarcisio Joao Schneider died in a car accident on Tuesday.

Brazil plays Croatia at the Itaquerao Stadium in Sao Paulo on Thursday. Scolari said he was finding strength to keep working by seeing his players' dedication in their preparations for the World Cup. He says: 'Sometimes we have to deal with some difficulties, but you have to try to move on.'

Asked
 if he hoped to emerge as the star of the tournament, the 22-year-old 
Barcelona forward replied: ‘I don’t want to be the best player in the 
World Cup, or the best striker. I want to win the World Cup.’

At one 
stage Neymar asked Scolari if he would be able to ‘sleep relaxed’ this 
evening. In essence could he be certain of his place for Thursday night’s tournament opener against Croatia.

‘Professor, am I playing tomorrow?’ he asked. ‘I want to go to sleep relaxed.’

‘Don’t worry,’ Scolari replied. ‘You can sleep easy.’

Neymar
 added: ‘I thank God for everything he has given me and the honour of 
working with Mr Scolari. I always saw him as a winner. I always try to 
get as much as I can out of his experience.

I hope I can get his winning
 streak and we will win this World Cup.’

‘I
 am anxious but I am also extremely happy because many people would like
 to be here. I hope we can help fulfil the dream of our nation, which is
 to win the World Cup.’
