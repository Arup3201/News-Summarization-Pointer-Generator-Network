It is often hailed as the most important meal of the day – and now we know why.

Workers skipping breakfast are costing the British economy £300 million a year, according to research.

Those who miss out on the morning meal lose 82 minutes of the working day due to poor productivity levels, which is having a direct result on UK businesses.

Not for all: Over half of British workers do not eat breakfast which means they lose 82 minutes of their working day being unproductive and unable to focus

Over half of UK workers (59 per cent) 
admit to not having breakfast - costing their employers millions every 
year in time lost when workers fail to focus.

Research from Weetabix on the Go reveals 56 per cent of Brits are too rushed to eat first thing in the morning, while ten per cent do not feel there is a suitable on the go option.

Those who go to work on an empty stomach are likely to see energy levels drop as a result of not having eaten since dinner the night before.

As the body runs out of fuel in the form of calories, hunger, fatigue and lack of focus kicks in as the body signals that it needs food.

Instead of focusing on the task at hand, the brain is forced to use whatever energy is left on quenching the basic instinct of eating.

Expensive meal: Workers skipping breakfast is costing businesses £300million every year

Londoners are the worst for skipping 
the first meal of the day with workers missing out more than a twice a 
week on average - costing their bosses up to 101 lost minutes in 
unproductive time.

Those in 
the West Midlands also admit to missing breakfast at least two mornings 
each week - totalling 73 minutes of lost productivity before lunch on 
those days.

Workers in the East Midlands skip breakfast the least, with more than half saying they always make time for a morning meal.

Under-25s are the group least likely to have something to eat when they wake up, with almost a third skipping breakfast five times a week.

In contrast those aged between 45 and 54 eat breakfast every day, with just 19 per cent missing it five days a week.

Ben Cooper from Weetabix On The Go said: ‘We know there is more pressure on time in the morning than ever before, which was something we heard from consumers, but  this research shows that poor productivity resulting from skipping breakfast is having a direct impact on the UK economy. ‘
