A Florida man has been arrested in connection with a road rage incident late last month in which a woman was dragged and then run over by a man in a pick-up truck.

Michael James Deely, 48, was taken into custody after detectives identified him as a suspect based on surveillance video from a parking garage.

Deely has been charged with aggravated battery in the April 24 incident in St Petersburg.

Road rage: Police say Michael Deely dragged a woman while driving at 25 miles an hour before dropping her and running her over

According to police, Deely was initially behind a woman, 39, on Second Avenue South and Second Street at around 10pm.

He honked his horn repeatedly before overtaking and pulling in front of her, slamming on his brakes without warning.

The woman stopped behind Deeley at a red light at Fourth Avenue South and Fourth Street, got out of her car and approached his window to talk to him.

That's when police say Deely grabbed the woman by the arm and drove through the red light with the woman in tow for about 50 feet, before dropping her and running her over.

The woman's arm was badly injured.

Deely told police that he honked his horn because the woman was texting on her phone and hadn't noticed the lights hadÂ  changed.

Terrifying ordeal: The woman was dragged and run over after stopping to speak to Deely, who was honking at her and deliberately slamming on his brakes

The woman approached his window and began yelling at him, he said, and denied grabbing her, saying she held onto his door and held on. He didn't realize he'd run her over, he told police.

A witness told ABC Action News that the woman's version of events backs up what he saw.

'They were driving, he was speeding up and slowing down, slamming on the brakes, just to make her mad,' Trudeau said.

'She got out of the car, went to say something and it looked like she tried pushing him or something,' Trudeau said. He added the truck was traveling about 25 mph while the woman was being dragged.

The woman's arm was bleeding heavily, said Trudeau, who went to her aid.

'She hit the ground pretty hard,' Trudeau said.

Police said they identified Deely from video taken of his 2002 Silver Toyota Tacoma from parking garage footage taken of the car just before the incident.

His car has been impounded and he was booked into Pinellas County Jail for aggravated battery.
