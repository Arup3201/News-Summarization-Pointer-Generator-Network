The Liberal Democrats sparked fury last night after saying they would not suspend an MP who had said he would be ready to fire rockets from Gaza into Israel.

David Ward, Lib Dem MP for Bradford East, initially apologised after he was accused of inciting violence following a post on Twitter last month in which he said: 'The big question is - if I lived in Gaza would I fire a rocket? - probably yes.'

Last night, after an investigation lasting three weeks, the Lib Dem chief whip Don Foster said he did not believe Mr Ward's comments were 'in any way anti-Semitic' or motivated by anti-Semitic intentions.

And he said he did not believe the tweet brought the party into disrepute.

Mr Foster said that Mr Ward had accepted his tweet offended some people and has insisted he would make sure his comments in the future are 'difficult to misinterpret' while also condemning violence from both Israelis and Palestinians.

The chief whip said he took into account Mr Ward's comments condemning violence on both sides before the tweet, his calls for a ceasefire, criticism of Hamas, explanation that the tweet sought to envisage how a Palestinian may feel and his apology.

Labour MP Ian Austin said: 'Most people will think David Ward said he thought terrorism was acceptable when he said he'd probably fire a rocket at Israel.

'If that doesn't bring the Lib Dems into disrepute you have to ask what would.'

Mr Foster recognised his decision 'will not satisfy some people'.

In a statement, Mr Foster said: 'David has subsequently repeated his apology and placed it and his explanation on his website.

'In light of that apology, the assurance by David Ward that he would do all he could to ensure comments he made would be in a form that would be difficult to misinterpret, and that he will continue - in relation to the Israeli/Palestinian situation - to condemn violence on both sides and support moves for a cease fire, I do not intend to take further action in relation to the tweet.

'I am conscious that this decision will not satisfy some people. To them I would say, at a time of considerable international unease in the Middle East, comments have been made by politicians from all parties that have been unwelcome by some or other section of society.

'The question I have had to answer is not, did the comments by David Ward cause offence to some people (within the party or outside), but did they bring the party into disrepute?

'David accepts that his tweet did cause offence to some people. He recognises that the use of Twitter as a form of communication can lead to misinterpretation and accepts the need for greater care in the future.

'However, I do not believe it was in any way anti-Semitic or motivated by anti-Semitic intentions and I do not believe his tweet brought the party into disrepute. I believe that his statement including an apology on July 23 should draw a line under this matter.'

Following last month's tweet, the Board of Deputies of British Jews called on Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg to withdraw the party whip from Mr Ward.

The MP subsequently said his comments were not intended to support Hamas rocket attacks, adding: 'If they gave the opposite impression, I apologise.'

Mr Ward's membership of the party has previously been suspended for a period following previous controversial remarks about Israel and the Jews.

Palestinian negotiators were last night considering a proposal to end the month-long Israel-Hamas war as the latest 72-hour cease-fire in the Gaza Strip was due to expire.

Since the truce went into effect Sunday, Israel has halted military operations in the coastal territory and Gaza militants have stopped firing rockets.

The ceasefire gave both sides time to negotiate a more sustainable truce and a roadmap for the coastal territory.

A member of the Palestinian delegation to talks in Cairo said his team was considering an Egyptian proposal for easing parts of the Israeli blockade of Gaza, bringing some relief to the territory.

But other key areas were still left unresolved, including Hamas' demand for a full lifting of the blockade and Israeli calls for Hamas to disarm. These would have to be left to later talks.

Yesterday Ismail Haniyeh, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, said that 'achieving a permanent truce can come only through lifting the blockade on Gaza.'

Amid the cease-fire, an Associated Press video journalist and a freelance Palestinian translator working with him were killed when ordnance left over from the war exploded as they covered a story about the conflict's aftermath.

Italian national Simone Camilli, 35, and Ali Shehda Abu Afash, 36, died when an unexploded missile believed to have been dropped in an Israeli airstrike blew up as Gazan police engineers worked to neutralise it in the northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya.
