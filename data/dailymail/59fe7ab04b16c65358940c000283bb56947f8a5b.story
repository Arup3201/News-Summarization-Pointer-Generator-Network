Brave members of the public took a rare opportunity to walk across the iconic Sage Gateshead roof this weekend. 

Climbing to twice the height of the Angel of the North, the intrepid roof walkers carefully tread on the steel panel shell of the landmark building, situated on the south bank of the River Tyne, taking in the magnificent Newcastle and Gateshead quayside under beautiful blue skies. 

The unique 'Roof Walk Experiences' includes a behind the scenes tour of the famous music and arts venue designed by Sir Norman Foster, and continues through weekends in June.

Brave: Members of the public walked across the Sage in Gateshead which is 120ft high

Fearless: Climbing to twice the height of the Angel of the North, the intrepid roof walkers carefully tread on the steel panel shell of the landmark building

Breathtaking: Once on top of the sage, the members of the public took in the views across Newcastle

At points the building is more than 120ft high - twice the height of the Angel of the North.

There are 3,043 stainless steel panels on its roof covering 9,000 square metres, the equivalent to more than two football pitches.

The Sage Gateshead contains three performance spaces; a 1,700-seater, a 450-seater and a smaller rehearsal and performance hall, the Northern Rock Foundation Hall.

Structurally it is three separate buildings, insulated from each other to prevent noise and vibration travelling between them.

Daring: Brave members of the public take a rare opportunity to walk along the iconic Sage Gateshead roof

The gaps between them may be seen as one walks around inside.

A special 'spongy' concrete mix was used in the construction, with a higher-than-usual air capacity to improve the acoustic.

More public roof walks are available on June 1 and 2 and June 15 and 16.
