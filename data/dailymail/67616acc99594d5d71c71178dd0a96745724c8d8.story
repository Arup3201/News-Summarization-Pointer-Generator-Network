It wasn't quite the 44 damned days of Brian Clough's Leeds United reign 40 years ago, but David Hockaday's spell at Elland Road did not last a great deal longer.

Just 70 days into Massimo Cellino's experiment with an unknown manager plucked from non-League, he was given the Caesarean thumbs down.

The unforgiving Italian owner, who famously got through 36 managers in 22 years at Cagliari, pulled the trigger after Wednesday's derby defeat by Bradford City.

Gone: Leeds sacked David Hockaday as manager after just 70 days in charge

Hockaday, hired from Conference side Forest Green Rovers in June, had vowed to fight on after the 2-1 defeat to the League One side in the Capital One Cup, the first time Bradford had beaten their illustrious neighbours for 28 years.

He said: 'I'm not a quitter, I'm a fighter. I feel as though not just myself, but the team at the moment, things just aren't going our way. 

'I don't have to say this but the players are 100 per cent behind the way we want to play. The president, everyone, they all want us to do well. We're getting a lot of bad press at the moment, some of it self inflicted, and we're making it very difficult for ourselves on the field at the moment.'

But Cellino deals solely in cold, hard facts and Hockaday has presided over three league defeats from four matches, leaving Leeds just above the Championship drop zone. 

The writing had been on the wall since Leeds suffered a 4-1 thrashing at Watford on August 23.

That day the 2,000-strong travelling contingent reflected long-held frustrations when they sang 'We're s*** and we're sick of it' during the second half of a 4-1 defeat.

Cellino had decided to axe Hockaday after the Watford defeat but dramatically changed his mind the following day, blaming 'one s*** mistake from Giuseppe Bellusci.'

But it proved to be a brief stay of execution as the 56-year-old was sacked on Thursday.

He said: 'I'd like to thank David for his efforts over the last two and a half months.

'But the results since the start of the season have meant we needed to act and make this decision.

'After the defeat at Bradford I realised that my decision to keep David at the club following the defeat at Watford was wrong, and I had to change my mind on the coach's position. As a club we will now begin our search for a new head coach.'

Former Middlesbrough defender Gianluca Festa and former Leeds captain and manager Gary McAllister are among the frontrunners to fill the hot seat and despite Cellino's reputation, there will be no shortage of candidates.

Hockaday's assistant, Junior Lewis, has also lost his job and Neil Redfearn will lead the team against Bolton on Saturday.
