Released: Ronnie Barker's son Adam Barker could receive £1.4million after being freed from jail after 13 weeks behind bars

The paedophile son of actor Ronnie Barker has been freed just 13 weeks after being jailed and is expected to receive an inheritance of more than £1.4million.

Adam Barker, 44, was jailed in October for 12 months for child porn offences, but was released on January 22 after time on remand was deducted, The Sun reported today.

He now stands to enjoy the cash he inherited from his parents while he was living alone in Hungary while on the run for eight years.

He fled the UK in 2004 and missed the funerals of his Porridge, Open All Hours and The Two Ronnies star father, who died aged 76 in 2005, and his mother Joy, who died aged 78 last year.

Isleworth Crown Court heard last year how the former bit-part actor had only 'relatively recently' found out about the deaths of his parents.

Barker gave himself up at a police station in west London in July after returning to the UK as he had run out of funds.

Ronnie Barker left an estate of £300,337 after he died of heart failure aged 76 in October 2005.

His will left £275,000 to be split between his three children - giving Adam just over £91,000 - and the rest to his wife Joy.

The bulk of his fortune did not feature in his estate as most jointly-held assets pass directly to a spouse.

Mrs Barker who lived near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds died in January last year, leaving a net estate of £6,520,426 which was split equally between her three children.

Adam and his brother Larry, 52, and sister Charlotte, 49, inherited around £1,340,000 from their mother after inheritance tax and other expenses.

Charlotte was made executor of her mother's will, responsible for distributing her estate. It is thought that the money due to her younger brother was left in an account waiting for him to claim it.

Adam Barker caused his father 
‘unquantifiable distress’ after going on the run for eight years to 
avoid being prosecuted for child porn offences, a judge said.

The
44-year-old’s whereabouts remained a mystery until he finally returned 
home to face justice earlier this year after his funds dried up.

He was jailed for a year after admitting possessing 1,675 indecent images of children at his home, including child rape.

Sentencing, Judge Rosa Dean told him: ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.’

Barker was arrested in 2003 as part of Operation Ore after police traced credit card payments he made for some of the images.

During
a dawn raid on his home in Ealing, West London, he told a detective 
examining his computer:  'You'd better take it otherwise it would a 
dereliction of your duty.'

Barker,
who appeared in the ITV detective series Wycliffe and had small parts 
in Monarch of the Glen, Casualty and the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, 
was released on bail while officers liaised with prosecutors about what 
charges to bring.

But he vanished leaving a note for 
his parents, which read: 'Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police
came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my 
computer. I was arrested.

Barker’s father never spoke publicly about his son's disappearance and friends said that he 'died of a broken heart'.

Detectives were waiting to question his son at the memorial service held at Westminster Abbey, but he did not turn up.

He also missed the funeral of his mother Joy, who died aged 78 after a short illness last January.

Barker claims that he did not own a computer and never viewed child pornography during his time in Budapest.

However, the judge said: 'Nobody is in a position to know what he was up to in Hungary.'

Barker pleaded guilty to 20 counts of child porn between January 1999 and June 2003.Of the 1,675 images and videos in his possession, 92 were graded level four – the second highest category.
