Mitt Romney today overcame one hurdle on the path to the White House - he was declared healthy enough to be President.

The 65-year-Republican was described by his personal doctor as 'a healthy-appearing, energetic, strong, physically fit male' in a letter released by his campaign on Friday.

Those considering voting for him will doubtless be relieved to hear that he has never suffered from HIV, cancer or epilepsy, and does not take illegal drugs.

But the document revealed that Mr Romney does have some medical issues - he is allergic to penicillin, has an enlarged prostate, and takes daily drugs to combat his high cholesterol.

The former governor of Massachusetts and his running mate Paul Ryan each released a message from their doctors designed to show that the pair have the physical ability to take on the presidency and vice-presidency.

Mr Romney's doctor is Randall D. Gaz, of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who has been treating the politican since 1989.

His letter noted that the candidate has been involved in few major medical emergencies, bar 'a concussion and fractures' sustained in a car crash in 1968.

But Dr Gaz revealed that his patient takes aspirin and Lipitor daily - though never penicillin, to which Mr Romney has an allergy.

The doctor praised Mr Romney's healthy lifestyle and 'high fiber diet', saying: 'He totally abstains from drinking any alcoholic beverages, and does not use any tobacco products or illicit drugs.'

As a Mormon, the former governor is forbidden from using alcohol, tobacco and narcotics.

Mr Romney's resting heart rate is apparently 'in the 40s' - more characteristic of a professional athlete than a senior citizen.

However, Dr Gaz warned that the Romney family had a history of heart problems and prostate cancer, adding that his patient knew to monitor signs related to these conditions.

Exercise: Paul Ryan is known for his love of running and his vigorous training regime

The letter set out a summary of Mr Romney's most recent physical exam, which took place last month and 'revealed a healthy-appearing, energetic, strong, physically fit male' who 'appears years younger than his age'.

Dr Gaz concluded with a thorough endorsement of his patient's medical health - and what appears to be an endorsement of his political ambitions too.

'He is vigorous man who takes excellent care of his personal physical health,' the letter said. 'He has reserves of strength, energy and stamina that provide him with the ability to meet unexpected demands.

'There are no physical impairments that should interfere with his rigorous and demanding political career as the next president of the United States.'

Good health: The last physical undergone by the President, pictured in Virginia on Friday, had positive results

Mr Ryan, the 42-year-old Wisconsin congressman, is known for his exercise regime and is intensely proud of his own physical fitness.

Brian P. Monahan, Attending Physician to the U.S. Congress, said Mr Ryan's 'overall health is excellent' despite his family history of fatal heart attacks.

According to the doctor's letter, the congressman does not smoke and his alcohol use is 'infrequent'.

Barack Obama releases the results of his annual physical, which last year declared him in excellent health and praised him for quitting smoking.
