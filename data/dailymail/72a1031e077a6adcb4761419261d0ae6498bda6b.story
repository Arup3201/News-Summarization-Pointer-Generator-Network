Jurors were shown pictures of a little boy stuffed in a box to recreate the way six-year-old Etan Patz was allegedly discarded after being choked to death.

A boy of Etan's height, weight and age was pictured in court on Friday curled up in a zip-up bag and squeezed into a produce box similar to the one Pedro Hernandez said he used to store the child's corpse in 1979.

Etan, who went missing as he walked to school, was never found. He was declared dead in 2001.

Defense attorneys, who claim Hernandez's alleged confession is fiction, will begin presenting evidence on Monday in the trial that is expected to last for at least another month.

Hernandez, from Maple Shade, New Jersey, told authorities he choked Etan in the basement of a Soho bodega and then put his body in a bag and tossed it in a box. 

In February, the trial was transformed by the discovery of three boxes of evidence from the investigation, including more than 1,400 pages of information. 

Alice Fontier, one of the attorneys representing Hernandez, said the findings could mean witnesses will be recalled.

'Given this massive disclosure at this point, in the middle of the trial, there may be issues,' she said. 

The boxes were found recently at a Harlem police station that covers public housing complexes in the area, prosecutors said late last week.

The location is miles from the precinct near where Etan disappeared on May 25, 1979, as he walked to school. Etan's body has never been found, and he was declared dead in 2001.

The boxes contain police records from the investigation, notes from assistant district attorneys who worked on the case and handwritten memos from a detective who investigated longtime suspect Jose Ramos, who was never charged. 

Some of the information involves two informants who were working with prosecutors to try to link Ramos to Etan's death. 

Other boxes contain missing-person posters, records of people arrested and catalogs of files made by the original detective on the case.

Immediately after the discovery in mid-February, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said that prosecutors were working to turn over the information to the defense attorneys.

Outside court, defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said it was unclear what the documents contain but he hopes they won't affect the case and he doesn't want a mistrial.

'We want it resolved for Mr Hernandez,' he said. 'He's been in jail for three years, so we definitely want to continue this case.'

Hernandez, a former bodega worker, pleaded not guilty to Etan's murder after telling police he strangled the boy.
