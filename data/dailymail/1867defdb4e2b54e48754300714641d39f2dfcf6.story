Kim Kardashian may have made mistakes when it comes to marriage, but her mother Kris Jenner has a few regrets too.Â 

The matriarch, who turned 56 on Sunday, has opened up about the affair that tore apart her first marriage to the late LA attorney, Robert Kardashian.

In an interview with Jay Leno last night to promote her new memoir, she called her infidelity 'the biggest regret of my life.'

Regrets, she has a few: The matriarch spoke about the affair that ruined her marriage to Robert Kardashian

'He was the only guy that I had dated,' she says of her first husband, whom she met when she was just 18.

'When you're very young you do a lot of stupid things. and it's probably the biggest regret of my life that I ended up having an affair.

'[I was] probably just really naive and stupid and restless and didn't realise that marriage has it ups and downs.

She continued: 'Someone once told me that it's like a roller-coaster, just ride it out, but I wasn't really old enough to hear those words.

In an exert from her book, Kris 
Jenner... And All Things Kardashian, published in this week's People 
magazine, she details the illicit liaison.

She writes: 'I don't know why I was having a mid-life crisis at 30, but I was.

'His name was Ryan and he was a producer. We had wild sex everywhere, all the time.'

'One morning, Robert had me followed. He found us at a restaurant.'

Her husband, with whom she had four children Kourtney, 32, Kim, 31, Khloe, 27, and Robert Jr, 24, filed for divorce in 1990.

'We told our kids together,' she writes. 'They stared at us, unbelieving at first, and then the waterworks.'

The lawyer, who represented O.J. Simpson in his 1995 murder trial, died in 2003 at the age of 59.

Kris went on to marry Olympic champion Bruce Jenner just five months after they were set up on a blind date.

They have two children together, Kendall, 16, and Kylie, 14, and recently celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary.
