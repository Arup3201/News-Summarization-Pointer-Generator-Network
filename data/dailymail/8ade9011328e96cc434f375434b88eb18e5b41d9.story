A father has been cleared of inflicting a catalogue of injuries on his baby daughter.

A jury took just 20 minutes to find Martin Thomas, 30, not guilty of ten charges including grievous bodily harm with intent following a six-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

As the judge announced each verdict, Mr Thomas became more emotional and by the time the tenth and final one was read out he was crying openly.

As he left the court room, however, Mr Thomas was approached by members of the public who had been in the public gallery and they shouted abuse at him.

Evie Grace Fisher-Thomas tragically died aged just four months from causes unrelated to the charges facing Mr Thomas.

But the father of two from Wigan, Greater Manchester, had to go through a trial accusing him of assaulting Evie Grace and leaving her with skull and rib fractures.

After being found not guilty today he spoke out about undergoing almost two years of hell including physical attacks and an attempt at suicide.

He said the ordeal had left him afraid to leave his home and cost him his job at Heinz's plant in Kitt Green but he now hoped to put the trial behind him and grieve properly for Evie.

Mr Thomas said: 'I was very emotional when the judge read out the verdict.

'The security woman said I was free to go so I left the court straight away.

'It's all such a big relief. All I ever wanted to do and set out to do was prove my innocence and now I have done that.

'I've been beaten up on the street and called names and for the last 20 months I've been stuck in the house. I had to leave my job and I've been suicidal, I tried taking my own life.

'You just wouldn't believe how much of a weight off my shoulders it actually is.

'No one can ever imagine or come close to imagining how I've felt unless they go through it themselves.

'I can now finally walk around the streets without looking over my shoulder and I can actually grieve properly for my daughter without any stress on my back.'

Treacher Collins syndrome is named after Edward Treacher Collins (1862–1932), an English surgeon and ophthalmologist who first described it in 1900.

It is a rare disorder found in about 1 in 50,000 births. It is characterised by a small lower jaw, downward-slanting eyes, hearing loss, drooping lower eyelids and malformed or absent ears.

Some individuals may be so mildly affected, they remain undiagnosed; others can have severe facial deformities, which can be life-threatening if the airway is blocked. 

Mr Thomas was found not guilty of inflicting injuries to Evie's skull and ribs following the trial, which he said was a harrowing experience as it forced him to relive every detail of his daughter's life.

Evie, who suffered from the rare condition Treacher Collins syndrome, died on February 21, 2013 from respiratory failure while sleeping at home with her parents, Mr Thomas and his girlfriend Hayley Fisher.

Mr Thomas also criticised people who had used online sites such as Facebook and Twitter in the time since his arrest to post abusive or unpleasant messages about him, but says he now just wants to put the ordeal behind him.

He said: 'The trial was awful. It went through everything that happened, the accident, the day Evie actually passed away, everything was brought back up.

'I have to say social media hasn't helped one little bit, seeing people's ideas, views and opinions. I just want everyone to be aware of the verdict and that I was found not guilty.

'I'm now going to try my best to just move forward and go back to work. I can now go out with friends as I've not been able to do that, I was scared of people thinking I had done something. Now I don't have to worry about that.

'I can put it all behind me the best I can.'
