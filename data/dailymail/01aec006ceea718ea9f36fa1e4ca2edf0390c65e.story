Power cuts on the Queen Mary 2 left the ocean liner without propulsion in the North Pacific.

The ship, which has more than 2,600 passengers and 1,000 crew on board, was left without electricity during two power cuts within days of each other. One incident happened as the ship sailed from Australia to Japan.

They are the latest of several cuts to strike the ship since it began a round-the-world journey in January. Passengers have paid up to Â£130,000 for the best suites on board.

The ship known as the 'queen of the seas' also had power outages on the way across the Indian Ocean early in the year.

One passenger, who asked not to be 
named, said he was stuck in a lift for about 10 minutes and had to be 
rescued after electricity failed for about 25 minutes and the engines 
stopped.

Other passengers, he said, peered over the side of the 151,400-ton vessel wondering what had happened when they realised the four diesel engines had stopped.

'We were stuck in the middle of the ocean without any power,' he told Australian media. 'It was an extraordinary series of events for a ship known as the queen of the seas.'

He said the second incident occurred in the early hours during moderately rough seas and strong winds during the liner's voyage from Port Louis, Mauritius, to Fremantle in Western Australia.

The vessel stopped for up to 10 minutes with the lights and TV going off for a moment and the engines failing to start up again for up to eight minutes.

Official statement: Mr David Jones, a spokesman for Carnival, which owns the 1132ft-long ship confirmed there had been 'brief power outages' but said these had occurred during routine maintenance

Mr David Jones, a spokesman for Carnival, which owns the 1132ft-long ship confirmed there had been 'brief power outages' but said these had occurred during routine maintenance.

'There was a brief power interruption and as expected would normally happen backup systems kicked in, so at all times there was full lighting and all controls were effective and operating normally,' he said.

Mr Jones said that passenger safety was not at risk and they would have barely noticed the interruption.

Australia's Maritime Safety Authority said it had received reports of a power outage from passengers during the first incident.
