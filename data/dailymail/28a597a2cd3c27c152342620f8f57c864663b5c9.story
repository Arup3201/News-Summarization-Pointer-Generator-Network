Len discovered that his great-grandfather's son was arrested for attacking his own father and he suffered horrific treatment in prison

What was life like for prisoners when hard labour really was tough? When they didn't have televisions or the chance to sue warders who dare abuse their human rights?

Celebrities including Len Goodman and Mariella Frostrup find out as a fascinating new documentary series called Secrets From The Clink reveals how their jailbird ancestors were treated in harsh Victorian prisons.

The show features five celebrities with porridge in their blood. Their ancestors' stories are dramatic – from tragic tales of people who couldn't return to the straight and narrow to criminals who managed to turn their lives around.  

Take Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman, who's initially judgmental when he learns his great-great-grandfather's son Henry was sentenced to five years' hard labour for attacking his own father.

'He was obviously a hooligan with a vicious temper,' says Len, who believes he deserved his punishment. But then he discovers that Henry, who was 22 at the time, was given nine months in solitary confinement at Pentonville, where he wasn't allowed to talk to anyone.

Even when prisoners had their daily hour of exercise, those in solitary had to wear a special hat that forced them to look straight ahead.

The aim was to break a prisoner's will, or 'grind them good' as the Victorians put it, but many ended up going insane and committing suicide. 'It's horrific,' ponders Len. 'I'm not sure I could have coped with that.'

Henry was then sent for proper hard labour. This often involved futile exercises with the sole purpose of making the prisoners sweat; the phrase 'money for old rope' refers to the small benefits men could earn for pulling apart tarred-up rope.

Another chore was to crank up a gravel-breaking machine with a handle – the prison officers would often tighten the machine to make it harder to crank, which led to their nickname 'screws'.

In 1863 Henry was sent to the island of Portland in the Channel to work in the quarries breaking stone for the Chatham naval yard. It was true hard labour, eight hours a day, six days a week.

The prisoners were given just enough food to enable them to work; oats and water for breakfast, stale bread and potato for dinner. Len is stunned at just how hard life was. 'When I see what he had to go through I'm starting to think the crime doesn't fit the punishment,' he says.

'I feel so sad for him. What he did was terrible but we all have that trait in us; we can all snap. The conditions in those prisons were atrocious. You can see why anyone would want to avoid being sent to one.'

TV presenter Mariella Frostrup, 51, is at first contemptuous of her great-great-grandfather William Martin Ekersley, who was convicted for fraud. 'It's a bit of a tacky crime, isn't it?' is her first response. But then she learns he was a salesman who went bust during a recession.

In those days you could not be personally bankrupted, so he enlisted a friend to keep some possessions such as his children's clothes out of the hands of his creditors. For that he got six months in prison.

But just before his trial the stress resulted in 30-year-old William becoming paralysed. Eventually he was given early release by the prison authorities, who were unable to look after him.

So he was released, still paralysed and still owing money, with a family to feed. 'It was so misguided, there was no safety net for real poverty,' says an astonished Mariella.

Another celebrity whose ancestor had money troubles was soap actress Michelle Collins, 52, whose great-great-great-grandfather was locked up in a debtors' prison for six months in 1848 when his Covent Garden umbrella-making business went bust.

Depicted poignantly in the works of Charles Dickens, whose own father was in one of them, these jails were draconian places to send people who owed money.

Michelle is in tears when she hears about what it was like being in the debtors' prison. But things did not improve much when he came out.

All of his assets, including his tools, were taken but he still needed to keep his family above the breadline. 'It must have been horrific,' she says.

'Even after you've done your time you come out and you have no money. I can't even imagine what it must have been like for him. It's about as bad as it can be.'

Actor and comedian Johnny Vegas, who has spoken of his own dependency on alcohol, discovers his great-great-great-great-grandmother on his mother's side was sent to prison more than 100 times for being drunk and disorderly.

Ann Haines, who came from a Bristol slum, was described in local newspaper reports as 'a notorious drunkard who has been repeatedly before the bench'.

Johnny, 43, is visibly moved as the truth of life as a penniless drunk in Victorian times sinks in. 'She was obviously a damaged individual and I feel like I really get her because of my relationship with alcohol,' says Johnny. 'I don't think anybody ever sat her down and asked her what was wrong.'

Contemporary reports show that she'd often be rearrested for sleeping rough as soon as she'd been released. 'She had nothing to lose,' he says, fighting back tears as he learns her problems started when her husband died. 'At least in prison she had shelter and got fed. However hard it was, it was better than living rough.'

Former ITV political correspondent Daisy McAndrew has perhaps had the most dramatic story of all in her great-great-great-great-great-grandmother, Mary Reibey.

A domestic servant, she was caught stealing a horse in a bid to escape the house and at first faced the gallows, but ended up being transported to Australia.

Her relatives had put together a petition to Queen Victoria begging that she should not be 'doomed to a miserable exile', but Australia ended up being the making of her.

After serving her sentence she was given some land in Sydney and married a freeman, junior officer Thomas Reibey. The two set up a wealth of successful businesses as well as having seven children. Mary's picture is now on the Australian $20 dollar note thanks to her charity work.

Daisy, 42, is astonished. 'To have that as my family legacy and to have some of her DNA is an incredible honour. It shows there are no boundaries in your life; there is nothing you cannot overcome.'
