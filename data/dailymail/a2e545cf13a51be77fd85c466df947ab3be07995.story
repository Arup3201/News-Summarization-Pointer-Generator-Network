Shocking CCTV footage has emerged showing of the moment a wild leopard wandered into the apartment lobby and snatched a pet dog.

The chilling clip lasts just 21 seconds, but films the entire savage attack in a housing complex in Mulund, northeast of Mumbai, India.

A fixed security camera picks up the sleek silhouette of the big cat as it strolls into the lobby.

On the prowl: The fully grown wild leopard wanders into the lobby of an apartment in Mulund, northeast of Mumbai, India

Closing in: The wild leopard moves towards the pet dog - seen in the bottom right corner of the shot - in these shocking CCTV images

Pounce: The CCTV cameras in the lobby capture the moment the wild cat grabs the oblivious dog by the throat

The lightly coloured dog can be seen curled up, possibly asleep, in the bottom right of shot - oblivious to the approaching predator.

Within a few seconds the leopard has closed in on the unsuspecting pet.

By the time the canine realises it is in mortal danger, the leopard clamps its jaws around the dog's throat. 

Struggle: The unsuspecting dog writhes around in an attempt to free itself

Grabbed: The cameras show the prone dog desperately try to force the wild cat to loosen its grip on its throat

The pet ferociously struggles in vain to
free itself from the cat's vice-like-grip, as it is dragged towards the
exit, during the video clip.

The leopard pauses for a moment, standing its front legs on its stricken prey, then darts towards the open doors.

The entire attack lasts little more 
than seven seconds before the dog is pulled out of camera shot and into the
darkness of the Mumbai streets, where it is assumed it was eaten.

Leopards have mauled or killed more 
than 100 people over the past decade in and around Mumbai and official 
attempts to solve the problem were making it worse.

The problem or wild cat attacks is not restricted to India.

Struggle: The leopard dwarfs the smaller pet as it is dragged towards the exit

Pause: The large cat rests for a split second as it heads towards the exit with the dog in its jaws

Earlier this year, marksmen had to shoot dead a leopard which seriously injured 15 people - including three police officers - after wandering into a suburb of Kathmandu.

A furious crowd dragged the mortally wounded animal through the streets of Gothatar on the outskirts of Kathmandu at.

Graphic photographs capture residents fleeing for their lives as the leopard prowled between buildings.

Hopeless: The wild cat forces the stricken pet dog towards the street outside the Mumbai apartment

Disappear: The last few frames of footage show the cat taking its prey off into the dark night

Armed police from Metropolitan Police
Circle, Koteshwor, were on the scene within minutes and managed to 
corner the animal, but not before it had mauled more than a dozen 
residents.

Upto three policemen and two 
officials from the Department of Forest were injured as they tried to 
trap the wild cat, according to local reports.

Police said that all the injured were rushed to Mother Land Hospital, Pepsicola for the medical treatment.
