Adam Scott remains in the hunt for a third successive Australian Masters title after he shot a third-round 71 to close to within fours shots of the lead ahead of Sunday's final round.

Scott is attempting to become the first player to win the tournament three years in a row and, after a one-over-par 73 in his first round, he shot a four-under-par 68 on Friday and a one-under-par 71 on Saturday to stay in the reckoning.

The world number two is one of eight players four shots off the pace, with Paul Spargo taking full advantage of Michael Wright's disappointing two-over-par 74 to take the lead on eight under.

Wright had led for the first two rounds at the Metropolitan Golf Club but now trails Spargo by a shot after he recorded five bogeys on Saturday.

Lucas Herbert, Nick Cullen and James Nitties are a further shot back on six under, while Geoff Ogilvy and Josh Younger are three shots off the lead on five under.

Chris Campbell, Nick O'Hern, Adam Bland, Nick Felton, Aaron Price, Matthew Griffin and Matthew Guyatt are the other seven players to join Scott on four under.
