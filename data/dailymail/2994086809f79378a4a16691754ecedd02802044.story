A young woman is set to lose her sight in her left eye after she was hit with a stiletto heel on a pub dancefloor.

The victim was at the crowded pub in Farnworth near Bolton, Greater Manchester, on Sunday night when witnesses said a row broke out between a group of drinkers at around 11.30pm.

One woman involved aimed a high kick which sent her stiletto shoe heel-first into the left eye of the victim, named locally as 27-year-old Katrina Coucill.

Paramedics attended the pub, Ye Olde Three Crowns, as fellow drinkers rushed to the young woman's aid.

She was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital where doctors are treating her for a serious eye injury on Wednesday.

Police confirmed that doctors have now told the victim she will lose her sight in her left eye.

Witnesses said two women and a man involved in the altercation left the pub, where Ms Coucill was meeting her mother, and police have since appealed for witnesses.

One local, who asked not to be named, said: 'She was screaming in agony. People went to her aid - by all accounts it was a terrible scene.' 

A friend of Ms Coucill said: 'We were in the pub because it was Bank Holiday.

Ms Coucill, pictured, was still being treated in hospital three days after the incident

'I was coming out of a toilet when I heard a scream and realised Katrina had been hurt.

'Everyone was crowded around her and an ambulance came straight away, to take her to hospital. It was awful.'

On Facebook, Ms Coucill's sister Sian  posted a message saying: 'Some ******* evil vicious people in this world.

'Hope they ******* catch you, you lowlife scumbags!!!!!' 

Police confirmed the victim suffered a serious eye injury when one woman kicked out with a high heel.

Officers added the offenders then left and the injured woman was taken to hospital.

They initially believed the shoe had flown off the woman's foot and hit the victim in the eye in a freak accident.

However, after viewing CCTV from the pub, officers have since said they believe Ms Coucill was kicked directly in the face.

Det Sgt Patrick Wood said: 'From what we have been told, we believe a woman was part of this group and she kicked out at the victim.

'She was wearing high heeled shoes and it looks like the point of the heel has made contact with her eye.

'She is currently in hospital being treated for her injury.

'With it being a Bank Holiday, the pub was very busy and it is likely someone would have seen what happened.

'I would appeal to anyone who was there and saw what happened or indeed those involved to contact police.'

Greater Manchester Police have arrested two women, aged 21 and 28, and a 28-year-old man on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

They were questioned over the incident in police custody and later bailed until October 22 while enquiries continue.
