An eccentric filmmaker who once held a lecturer position at MIT allegedly robbed a New York bank on New Year's Eve while filming the heist and said he did it for art's sake.

The New York Post reports that Joseph Gibbons, 61, was charged with robbery on Friday after taking $1,000 from a Capital One bank in downtown Manhattan.

According to court documents, Gibbons walked into a branch on Bowery and Grand Street armed with a camcorder.

Hold up: A former MIT professor who was charged with robbery after taking $1000 from a Manhattan bank allegedly told another man waiting to be charged he did it as research for a film

He handed the bank teller a note, which asked for a donation to be made to his church, according to documents filed in court.

Rhode Island police believe that the former professor, who currently lives in a Boston suburb, is responsible for a similar heist at a bank in Providence.

According to the Providence Journal, a middle-aged man robbed a Citizens Bank in November, telling the clerk who handed over $3,000, 'Thank you, this is for the church.'

The Post reports that while waiting to be arraigned for the incident on New Year's Eve, Gibbons told another man who was locked up the inspiration for the robberies. 

'He was doing research for a film,' said 27-year-old Kaylan Sherrard. 'It’s not a crime; it’s artwork… He’s an intellectual.'

In the past, Gibbons said he tried to cultivate a drug habit as research for a couple of his short films.

'I was involved with all this as research,' he told art magazine Big Red and Shiny. 'The romantic idea of the artist getting involved in these kinds of activities as a kind of research, gaining experience.'

Professor: 61-year-old Joseph Gibbons was charged Friday for the New Year's Eve heist, though he is also sought in connection to another robbery in Rhode Island

According to Gibbons's LinkedIn profile, he was a visiting artist at Bard College for three months in 1990, and later took a lecturer position at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Though as of Saturday, a page for Joe Gibbons on MIT's Program in Art, Culture and Technology turned up a dead link, an earlier version of the site shows Joe Gibbons was a lecturer there from 2002 to 2010.

A biography on that page states Gibbons's work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and Whitney Museum in New York, the Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Reina Sofia in Madrid.

It also notes that his 2002 film 'Confessions of a Sociopath' was considered among the Best Films of the Year by Artforum magazine.

An email sent to an address attributed to Gibbons was not returned.
