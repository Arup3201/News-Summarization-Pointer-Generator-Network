Each has her own sense of style. But the wives of Windsor managed to blend beautifully together yesterday.

Kate, Camilla and Sophie were a portrait in pastels as they joined the historic Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle.

Laughing and chatting, the Duchesses of Cambridge and Cornwall and the Countess of Wessex were waiting together to watch their princes parade past.

The Most Noble Order of the Garter

The Duchess of Cambridge chose a cream double-breasted Alexander McQueen coat-dress, while Camilla looked chic in cream Anna Valentine dress and Philip Treacy hat. Sophie Wessex wore a pale pink suit - and all three wore nude court shoes

Snap! The Royal trio (from left, Countess of Wessex, Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Cornwall) wore almost identical shoes with their matching outfits

And although the ladies were elegantly
 subtle in creams, beige blush and pale pinks, there was no chance of 
missing their husbands in the bright blue velvet cloaks of the Garter 
Order and hats topped with a froth of feathers.

Founded by King Edward III in 1348, 
the Order of the Garter is the country’s oldest order of chivalry and 
the last remaining honour to be given at the discretion of the 
sovereign.

Prince William, Prince Charles and 
Prince Edward were all marching proudly, along with the Duke of 
Edinburgh, who is recovering well from his recent illness.

Tender moment: Crowds line the streets of Windsor to watch the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Charles during the procession to the annual Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle today

There's one way to ensure you’re not outdone by a stylish new addition to the family – turn up wearing almost the same thing.  

Yesterday Sophie and Camilla co-ordinated their outfits with Kate in shades of beige, cream and blush. And all three wore the seemingly obligatory nude heels.

Kate gave her Alexander McQueen coat dress (£2,290) another outing after she wore it at last year’s Trooping the Colour.

Sophie’s Bruce Oldfield suit with shawl collar was first worn to Zara Phillips’s wedding last summer.

Also sticking to an old favourite was Camilla, in a custom-made Anna Valentine cream chiffon dress and pink coat.

This glamorous trio is proof, if any were needed, that a style that looks good on a woman in her 30s can also be reworked for a lady in her 60s.

As the procession wound its way 
through the grounds of Windsor Castle to St George’s Chapel,  a lively 
Camilla regaled a giggling Sophie and Kate with amusing tales.

The three wore remarkably similar outfits in co-ordinating pale pinks and creams.             

Kate, 30, dazzled in a white Alexander
 McQueen coat dress and Jane Corbett hat.

Camilla, 65, sported an Anna 
Valentine cream chiffon dress and pale pink coat with a dramatic Philip 
Treacy hat.

And the Countess of Wessex, 47, looked elegant in bespoke Bruce Oldfield suit and saucer-shaped hat.

It was hard to spot the difference when it came to shoes, however.

Kate was in her trusty LK Bennett £185 nude Sledge heels.

Camilla’s slightly lower £165 heels 
were from Stuart Wietzman at Russell and Bromley while Sophie went for 
platform Jimmy Choos at  £435.  

There was one other big star on the 
day.

Prince Philip, 91, joined the Queen for the half-mile walk from the
 castle to the chapel. She looked delighted to have him at her side 
again.

Celebration: Camilla and Kate are all smiles as they leave the chapel after the ceremony, while William seems relieved to be able to remove his velvet hat

The Duke of Edinburgh had recovered sufficiently from his bladder 
infection to be able to join the Queen on the half mile procession from Windsor castle to St George's chapel today. The two departed in a coach after the ceremony

By Royal order: The Queen herself hands out the Order of the Garter, and unlike the OBE or CBE honours list, she does not need to consult the 
Government to discuss who will receive the honour. Membership in the Order is strictly limited and includes the monarch, the Prince of Wales, not more than 24 companion members, and a number of supernumerary members

Members of the Garter Princess Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester (centre right); Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex; Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Charles, Prince of Wales join the procession

Baroness Soames and Sir John Major led the procession from Windsor castle to the chapel today

Charles, Camilla, William and Kate returned by carriage to the castle after the new members were welcomed to the Order

No doubt grateful for the sunny weather, the royals travelled by open top carriage - a far cry from the wet weather of the Jubilee weekend

The Order of the Garter is the most senior and oldest British Order of Chivalry, founded by Edward III in 1348

Majestic: There were spectacular scenes at Windsor Castle today as the Queen was joined by fellow Garter members for the annual ceremony at St George's chapel

2011: Kate wore the same Alexander McQueen coat-dress on 16 June last year for the Trooping the Colour ceremony on the Queen's official birthday

She has earned the moniker High Street Kate thanks to her penchant for Zara, Reiss and Whistles.

But the Duchess of Cambridge has long been fond of a designer outfit - although she is careful to recycle the most expensive ones on subsequent events, avoiding falling into the trap of being seen as simply a well-appointed clothes horse.

Kate's Alexander McQueen coat-dress, a £2,290 garment designed by Sarah Burton, the designer behind the duchess's lace wedding dress, had been debuted by Kate almost exactly one year ago today.

Kate chose the dress to wear for the Trooping of the Colour ceremony on 16 June last year, another spectacular occasion of pomp and pageantry that saw the duchess turn up to support her husband as her wore yet another dramatic outfit.

The choice of cream today was a wise one - the simple hue made for a neutral backdrop that allowed the vibrant colours and rich fabrics and feathers of her husband's Garter costume to shine. 

Equally, just as it did it's last airing, it co-ordinated perfectly with Camilla's cream dress - this time an Anna Valentine piece. And Sophie Wessex's pink Bruce Oldfield skirt suit topped the trio off nicely.
