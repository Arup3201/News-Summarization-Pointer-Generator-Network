A Melvin, Michigan woman was brutally
 attacked by a stray cat and shocking footage of the mauling has already
 gained a million views on YouTube.

The
 woman, who identified herself to reporters only as Maxx, endured the 
horrific attack November 30 but only recently realized it had been 
caught on her home surveillance camera.

The attack left her face swollen and infected and the cat named Buddy dead as officials were forced to test it for rabies.

Bizarre: Video of Maxx being attacked November 30 was uploaded to YouTube and gained over a million views in just one day

Buddy: The cat was a stray that Maxx had taken in over the sumemr to save it from being euthanized. After the attack, Buddy had to be put down to be tested for rabies

Maxx had taken in Buddy over the summer to save him from being put to sleep and was shocked that he attacked.

‘Your first reaction was to get him off and when I went to go pull, I could feel his teeth,’ Maxx told WJBK.

The harrowing process of getting him off badly gouged Maxx’s face and eventually caused cellulitis and serious swelling.

Buddy had to be euthanized in order to be tested for rabies. He tested negative.

‘He
 was sweet as pie,’ Maxx said. ‘When they came to get him I couldn't 
even watch because even though he did that to me, I couldn't see them 
take him away because I knew what they were going do to him.’
