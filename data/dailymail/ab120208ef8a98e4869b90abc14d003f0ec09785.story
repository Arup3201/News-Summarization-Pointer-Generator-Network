A statue of Margaret Thatcher could be erected in Trafalgar Square under plans being considered by ministers.

Downing Street gave the idea of a permanent memorial to the former Prime Minister its backing as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square ‘could be one of the options’.

Boris Johnson also came out in support of the idea, which has been publicly backed by former military personnel who served in the victorious Falklands campaign in 1982.

There is a growing clamour for a statue to be placed in central London on public view, to mark Baroness Thatcher’s immense impact on Britain.

In particular there are calls to use the vacant plinth in the shadow of Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square, at the opposite end of Whitehall from the Houses of Parliament.

However, there are concerns that any memorial could become the target of vandals and protests, after police clashed with revellers at hate-filled street parties ‘celebrating’ Baroness Thatcher’s death on Monday at the age of 87.

There is already a statue of the former Tory leader in the member’s lobby outside the main doors to the chamber of the House of Commons.

When the 7ft 6in statue was unveiled in 2007, Baroness Thatcher was the first living former Prime Minister to be honoured in such a way by the Commons

However, in 2002 a marble statue of the three-times election winner was decapitated after it went on show at London’’s Guidhall.

Theatre producer Paul Kelleher was jailed for three months after attacking the £150,000 work of art.

The court heard that when police arrived minutes after the vandalism, Kelleher said: ‘I think it looks better like that.’

Today ministers appeared to back the idea of a statue which could act as a long-lasting tribute to Baroness Thatcher.

Mr Hammond said: ‘I think it would be very appropriate to have a memorial to Margaret Thatcher somewhere in London.

‘I haven’t personally given any thought yet to where that should be, but certainly the fourth plinth could be one of the options. Let’s look at that in slower time, I think these things are better thought about in slightly slower time after the event.’

David Cameron’s official spokesman said the Prime Minister thought it was a ‘good idea to think of ways of how in due course Lady Thatcher can be best commemorated’.

The London Mayor’s office also revealed Mr Johnson’s office is now exploring options of a site for a statue.

A spokesman for the GLA said: ‘The Mayor believes Baroness Thatcher deserves a prominent statue in a central London location and his team will assist with exploring suitable options.’

Lord Tebbit said that using the plinth in Trafalgar Square would enable Nelson to 'keep an eye on' Baroness Thatcher

The fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square has remained unfilled, but since 1998 has been used to showcase a rotating collection of artworks.

Since Baroness Thatcher’s death from a stroke was announced on Monday, the plinth has become the focus of calls for a permanent statue.

John Muxworthy, a Lt Commander on the SS Canberra during the Falklands War, said: ‘Let's have a full scale statue next to Nelson to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation. She was a great Briton, let's put her at the centre.

Former Tory party chairman Lord Tebbit added: 'I think it would be appropriate for her to be honoured publicly in the centre of London. She could be in Trafalgar, where Nelson could keep an eye on her.'

Tory MP Conor Burns, who visited Baroness Thatcher weekly, said the statue in the Commons already served to highlight her political impact.

‘I always say to young people when we go around Parliament, there are only two Prime Ministers of the twentieth century who are not wartime leaders who have statues in Members’ Lobby, they are Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher - arguably the only two Prime Ministers of the twentieth century to use their office to fundamentally try and change the country they governed, and I think that might inspire some young people.’
