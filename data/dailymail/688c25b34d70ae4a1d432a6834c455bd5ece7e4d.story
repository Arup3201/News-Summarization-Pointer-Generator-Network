Manchester City are on course to comply with UEFA’s financial fair play rules after cutting their annual losses thanks largely to a big boost in domestic television money and cutting their wage bill.

The club remains loss-making, for now, posting an annual deficit of £23million for the 2013-14 season in figures just published. That is half the sum they lost the previous season.

But big increases in TV money as well as another leap in commercial revenues, bolstered by keys sponsors including Etihad, mean City are highly unlikely to be adjudged to have fallen foul of UEFA’s FFP rules again.

Manchester City have reported record revenues of £346.5million for the year ending May 31, 2014

Last year they were deemed to have broken the FFP rules as a result of including almost £47m of income in their accounts from sales of intellectual property, £22.45m of it to related parties. In laymen’s terms, UEFA took a dim view of City conjuring up income that could not be justified in order to attempt to balance their books.

The accounts for 2013-14 notably include zero income from sale of any intellectual property after City vowed as part of their settlement with Uefa not to repeat what they did last year.

Instead City recorded notable rises in all the traditional revenue streams of a football club, with match day income rising from £39.6m to £47.5m, UEFA TV revenue rising to £31.3m from £24m, domestic TV income soaring to £101.9m from £64.3m on the back of the Premier League’s new £5.5bn TV deals, and commercial income jumping to £165.8m from £143m.

City do not disclose the breakdown of where their commercial income comes from, and while large sums are believed to come from the Middle East, where the club’s owner Sheikh Mansour is based, City are also attempting to diversify their revenue streams via a network of global partners.

The Etihad club now expect to comply with UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules

As the club’s total income rose by 28 per cent to £346.5 million, the club’s biggest single outlay, on wages, fell from £233m in 2012-13 to £205m last season, which equates to ‘only’ £561,764 per day.

Among the clubs who have declared their financial results for 2013-14 so far, City’s wage bill now falls from being the biggest in the Premier League to second biggest behind city rivals Manchester United, who had a comparative figure of £214.8m last season.

It is not clear, however, whether all the staff who were counted in last year’s figures are also counted in this year’s figures or whether some of them have been hived off into a different company for accounting purposes.

Last year’s accounts showed City had 222 ‘football staff’ including players and the latest account shows this has dropped to 112 staff. Overall City’s staff numbers have inexplicably fallen from 449 people a year ago to 314 in the latest accounts.

City have halved their losses from their 2013-14 Premier League winning season

The most obvious explanation at a time of expansion for City and the opening of an impressive new campus would be that some staff are now paid via a different subsidiary company of Sheikh Mansour’s global football franchise business - of which City is just one arm.

City have confirmed to Sportsmail that the ‘missing’ staff are now paid via subsidiary companies and City are billed for their services. The accounts suggest this accounting manoeuvre - entirely legal - reduced City’s wage bill by around £10.8m year on year.

The other reason the wage bill may have fallen is that last year’s £233m included pay-offs to former manager Roberto Mancini and some coaching staff.

City’s losses take into account a £16m fine from UEFA for breaking FFP rules in their last accounting period and the latest numbers should mean that the full £50m initially imposed will not now be imposed; two-thirds of it was conditional.

City believe they are in good financial shape to break even or even become profitable from the current season onwards.

City’s chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak says: ‘We have moved beyond the period of heavy investment that was required to make the club competitive again, it is commercial growth of the kind we are seeing today that will underpin and support our operations in the future.’

The accounts show City spent a net sum of £38.8m on summer transfers including Eliaqium Mangala, even accounting for the sales of Javier Garcia and Jack Rodwell. Mangala’s transfer fee has repeatedly been reported as £32m but in fact was closer to £40m to three third-party owners combined.
