Jailed: 'Lady' Jenny Glanister, 51, who took £338,000 from the care home where she worked and its residents

With a penchant for expensive jewellery and fur coats, Jenny Glanister liked to think of herself  as a member of the aristocracy.

But the self-styled 'Lady Glanister' was behind bars yesterday after stealing more than £330,000 from the care homes where she worked to fund a luxury lifestyle of cruises, magnums of champagne and diamond jewellery.

A court heard the 51-year-old accountant became hooked on a television shopping channel – splashing out £233,000 on 180 items of jewellery during a six-year spending spree.

Many of the packages from the Rocks & Co channel, which included an £18,000 diamond brooch, were ordered under  the Lady Glanister name she had adopted.

In reality, Glanister – the daughter of a respectable couple who ran their own furniture business for 60 years – was a crooked finance manager responsible for two care homes treating adults with learning difficulties.

Between 2004 and 2010 she stole a total of £338,805 from the homes and residents' personal accounts.

She was jailed on Tuesday for 32 months by a judge who said she was guilty of 'wholesale plundering' and a breach of trust.

The court heard Glanister was trusted with the accounts of Oakfield Ltd, which runs two care homes in Northamptonshire.

However, she used her role to  funnel cash from the homes  and residents into her own  bank account.

When police searched her then home in the village of Whiston, Northamptonshire, they found 15 fur coats, racks of designer clothes, unopened bottles of champagne and a receipt for  a £3,400 cruise.

They also discovered packets of jewellery which had been addressed to 'Lady Glanister'. The court heard Glanister was in charge of Oakfield’s accounts for its homes in the villages of Easton Maudit, near Wellingborough, and Yardley Hastings, near Northampton.

She was trusted with debit cards, petty cash and residents' personal finances.

Prosecutor Kathryn Howarth told Northampton Crown Court that the fraud was uncovered when Glanister left the company in 2010.

Her successor discovered 'serious and alarming anomalies' in the firm's accounts.

Glanister, she said, had used the firm's accounts to pay her heating bills and petrol for her car, inflated her salary and paid herself for extra hours not worked, then forged spreadsheets to cover her tracks.

It was found that £72,923 had been taken from the homes' petty cash, £227,000 in cheques cashed from the accounts  and £17,272 by claiming for  additional hours Glanister had not worked.

More than £2,000 was charged to Oakfield for the cost of fuel for her home and £17,000 to the residents' personal accounts.

Glanister also charged tights and spray tan to the residents' accounts.

Families of some adults at the homes reported difficulties in obtaining money from their relatives’ accounts and complaints were made.

Toby Long, defending, said Glanister stole the money because she felt 'undervalued'.

He added: 'The money was not needed and to some extent it was stealing for comfort or control in which she perhaps lacked the ability to control her life.'

Glanister, who now lives in Great Billing, Northampton, admitted eight counts of theft, fraud and false accounting.

Sentencing, Judge Michael Fowler warned her: ‘This is  effectively theft and a breach  of trust.

'You pleaded guilty to obtaining over a third of a million pounds from your employer.

'You were aware of precisely what you were doing and precisely what consequences there would be.'

He said she was 'responsible for wholesale plundering involving a vast number of transactions'.

Joan Bohl, whose disabled daughter Alexa was at one of the homes, said Glanister was 'ghastly' and her actions defied description.

'My daughter is 32 but she has a mental age of 18 months,' she said.

'When her carer asked for some of her money to buy her a toothbrush Jenny Glanister said there was none available. In the meantime this creature was buying 15 furs and blowing £233,000 on the shopping channel.'

A spokesman for Northamptonshire County Council said the homes were not council-owned or run, but the authority did place residents there.

All the recovered items will be  auctioned with the proceeds going to the care homes.
