Former Southampton star Matt Le Tissier will swap Soccer Saturday for Countdown to become the fourth professional footballer to appear on the Channel 4 show.

Le Tissier, 46, announced on Twitter he has passed his contestant audition and will be filming this autumn.

The eight-cap England international has previously appeared as the show's 'Dictionary Corner' guest in 2009, memorably solving a numbers round puzzle which had foxed both contestants - including an eventual series semi-finalist - and resident maths expert Rachel Riley.

'Hope you've brushed up on the numbers,' Le Tissier joked to the Oxford graduate as he announced his upcoming appearance.

He faces stiff competition for bragging rights from his fellow ex-pros who hold seven victories between them - former Norwich man Adrian Coote failed to secure the Countdown teapot but Clarke Carlisle won two games and Neil MacKenzie won five en route to a series quarter-final berth.

Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling was a host of the show before Nick Hewer took the reins, as was former BBC and ITV anchor Des Lynam.
