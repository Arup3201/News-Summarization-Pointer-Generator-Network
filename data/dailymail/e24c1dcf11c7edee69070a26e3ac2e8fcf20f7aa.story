A new species of dinosaur discovered in China might have been named after a harmless puppet, but it was a fearsome ancient predators.

The remains of the long-snouted tyrannosaur nicknamed Pinocchio rex, which belonged to the same family as Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered by scientists.

Researchers believe the animal, which stalked the Earth more than 66 million years ago, was a terrifying carnivore that lived in Asia during the late Cretaceous period.

A discovery not to be sniffed at: The remains of the long-snouted tyrannosaur Qianzhousaurus sinensis - nicknamed Pinocchio rex (pictured) - which belonged to the same family as Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered by scientists in China

The bones were discovered by workmen on a construction site in the city of Ganzhou in southern China.

They took them to a local museum, after which experts from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and the University of Edinburgh became involved in examining the bones.

Palaeontologists had been uncertain about the existence of long-snouted tyrannosaurs until the remains of the dinosaur - whose proper name is Qianzhousaurus sinensis - were unearthed..

With an elongated skull and long, narrow teeth, the newly-found predator would have looked very different from a T.rex, which had thick teeth and more powerful jaws.

It is thought that Qianzhousaurus 
sinensis lived alongside other tyrannosaurs but would not have been in 
direct competition with them, since they probably hunted different prey.

new species is not a lie: Palaeontologists had been uncertain about the existence of long-snouted tyrannosaurs until the remains of the dinosaur were unearthed in southern China. Just two other skeletons of juveniles have been found before but it was unclear at to whether they were a 'new' species

One of the authors of the study, Dr Steve Brusatte of Edinburgh University's School of GeoSciences, said: ‘This is a different breed of tyrannosaur. It has the familiar toothy grin of T.rex, but its snout was much longer and it had a row of horns on its nose.

‘It might have looked a little comical, but it would have been as deadly as any other tyrannosaur, and maybe even a little faster and stealthier.’

‘It is an awesome specimen, almost a complete skeleton. It is a really one in a million find that those workers made.’

The newly discovered specimen is of an animal nearing adulthood. It was found largely intact and ‘remarkably well preserved, the experts said.

Before this find just two fossilised tyrannosaurs with elongated heads had been pulled from the Earth, but since they were juveniles it was unclear whether they were from a new class of dinosaur or if they were simply at an early growth stage.

Researchers have now created a new branch of the tyrannosaur family for specimens with very long snouts and they expect more dinosaurs to be added to the group as excavations in Asia continue to identify new species.

Professor Junchang Lu, of the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, said: ‘The new discovery is very important. Along with Alioramus from Mongolia, it shows that the long-snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed in Asia.

‘Although we are only starting to learn about them, the long-snouted tyrannosaurs were apparently one of the main groups of predatory dinosaurs in Asia.’

Details of the study are published in the journal Nature Communications.
