Madison Bumgarner might want to think twice before driving the brand new  truck General Motors gave him for winning World Series MVP.

All 2015 Chevy Colorado pickups have been recalled over a possible defect in the driver's side airbag that could stop it from deploying correctly. 

The company recently announced it would stop production of the vehicles entirely until the defect can be fixed on the factory lines.

A sweaty, nervous GM executive became an accidental star when he stumbled all over his prepared remarks about the truck on live TV, saying it came with 'class-leading, um, you know, technology and stuff.'

However, he failed to mention the recall. 

According to Automotive News, GM was forced to stop production of its highly-anticipated Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups about two weeks after they began shipping them out earlier this month. 

GM notified dealers about the defect saying: 

'This condition will cause the driver-side airbags to not function as designed and may adversely affect the crash performance of the driver-side airbags.'

GM says the vehicles are safe to drive until the defect is repaired. 

GM's PR team was quick to capitalize on the GM executive's 'technology and stuff' gaff

Bumgarner turned in a legendary performance in three games of the World Series - including working five innings as closer in last night's Game Seven victory over the Kansas City Royals.

He pitched a total of 52 2/3 innings in the post-season this year, an all-time record in Major League Baseball. 

In the World Series, he started two games and gave up just one run. In Game Five on Sunday, he pitched a compete game and gave up zero runs - nine innings of shut out baseball.

Incredibly, he was called up again on short rest to pitch in relief in the fifth inning. He surrendered zero runs and stayed in to complete the game. 

The Giants won only one World Series game without the left-handed pitcher's help.
