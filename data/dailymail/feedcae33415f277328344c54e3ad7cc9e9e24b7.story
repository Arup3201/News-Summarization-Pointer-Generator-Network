A Scotland Yard detective investigating phone hacking has been arrested on suspicion of leaking stories to The Guardian.

The move came as News of the World reporter Dan Evans, 35, was also arrested over alleged phone hacking.

And in a development that could expose top executives at the defunct tabloid, Glenn Mulcaire, the private eye at the centre of the scandal, has been ordered to reveal who commissioned him to tap into voicemails.

Arrested: The 51-year-old officer was reportedly a member of the Scotland Yard team investigating phone hacking at the News of the World

Anti-corruption officers arrested a 
51-year-old detective constable at his desk where he was working on the 
hacking investigation, Operation Weeting, on Thursday.

It is the first time that a police 
officer has been held in connection with the inquiry on suspicion of 
misconduct in a public office.

Scotland Yard was forced to act over a series of highly embarrassing 
leaks to the newspaper which has infuriated the officer in charge of the
 highly sensitive probe.

Leaks to the paper have infuriated the officer running the investigation, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers.

Yesterday, she said: ‘I made very 
clear when I took on this investigation the need for operational and 
information security. It is hugely disappointing this may not have been 
adhered to.

‘The Metropolitan Police Service take the unauthorised disclosure of 
information extremely seriously and has acted swiftly in making these 
arrests.’

Last night the officer was suspended 
from duty and bailed until next month. On the same day police also 
quizzed a News of the World feature writer over separate hacking 
allegations.

The Guardian refused to confirm whether it was the subject of the allegations.

Evans, a News of the World features writer, was questioned and released on bail last night.

He had been suspended in April 2010 
after interior designer Kelly Hoppen – stepmother of actress Sienna 
Miller – brought a damages claim alleging he tried to hack into her 
voicemails.

Lawyers for the journalist said an extensive investigation found no evidence to support Ms Hoppen’s claims.

A senior executive at News International had claimed that Evans’s defence was that he phoned Miss Hoppen’s number for legitimate reasons and accidentally accessed her voicemail when the keys on his phone got stuck.Yesterday the reporter quizzed by detectives for a number of hours before being released on bail. Meanwhile, details about who ordered the hacking are set to emerge after Glenn Mulcaire was ordered to reveal who commissioned him to tap into the voicemails of model Elle MacPherson and five other public figures including Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes by the end of next week.Mulcaire has lost an appeal against a court order obliging him to name those who instructed him, something he has resisted since February.

The ‘significant development’ could reveal who was pulling the strings at the News of the World and whether those in charge of the newspaper, former editor and News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and former editor Andy Coulson sanctioned or had any knowledge of the illegal practice- a claim they have denied.Mulcaire, who was jailed in 2007 after pleading guilty to hacking the phones of members of the royal household for the now defunct tabloid, was forced into the disclosure following legal action by the comedian and actor Steve Coogan.The star’s lawyers argued that if it were proved that the News of the World had instructed Mulcaire to hack into their phones, it would show that phone hacking was taking place at an industrial scale.Mulcaire must now name the executives who ordered him to access the voicemails of Elle MacPherson, MP Simon Hughes, the celebrity PR Max Clifford, the football agent Sky Andrew, Jo Armstrong, a legal adviser to the Professional Footballers Association and Gordon Taylor, the former head of the PFA.

High Court: Glen Mulcaire will be forced to give up the names of those at the News of the World who asked him to hack phones as a result of legal action by lawyers representing Steve Coogan, right

Yesterday Mr Coogan said: ‘After six 
months of refusing to answer these questions I am pleased that Glenn 
Mulcaire has now finally been ordered to say who at the News of the 
World asked him to hack the mobile phones of Max Clifford, Sky Andrew, 
Gordon Taylor, Simon Hughes MP, Elle MacPherson and Jo Armstrong.

‘Whilst
 I am pleased with this latest development I remain frustrated by Mr 
Mulcaire’s refusal to answer questions about who authorised him to 
unlawfully access my voicemail messages and will continue to press for 
these answers.’

At his trial in 2006 Mulcaire admitted hacking the phones of five of the six names in Coogan’s court order.

In February, the High Court ordered Mulcaire to reveal who instructed him in relation to the six people.

Mulcaire sought leave to appeal but on 1 August Lord Justice Toulson rejected his application.

His solicitor, John Kelly of Schillings, described the Court of Appeal ruling as ‘a very significant development’.

He
 said: ‘He will now have to identify exactly who at the News of the 
World asked him to access the mobile phones of the named individuals and
 who he provided the information to at the News of the World.

‘Mr Mulcaire is due to provide these answers by the end of the month and we await his answers with interest.’
