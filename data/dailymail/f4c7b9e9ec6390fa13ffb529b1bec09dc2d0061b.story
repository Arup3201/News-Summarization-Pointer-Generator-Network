When Gordon Olley went to see A Hard Day’s Night with his girlfriend in 1964, little did he know that he would later be walking out of the cinema with another woman on his arm.

Now, the 67-year-old has taken his wife Mary, 65, to watch the Beatles film which they saw on their first ‘date’ at the same cinema in Dereham, Norfolk, exactly 50 years ago.

He was just 17 when he took his then-girlfriend Edna, to watch the movie on August 30, 1964 - but she had asked him to buy an extra ticket for her best friend Mary, who was then just 15.

Happy couple: Gordon Olley, 67, took his wife Mary, 65, to see the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night - which they saw on their first 'date' at the same cinema in Dereham, Norfolk, exactly 50 years ago

Back in the day: Mr Olley (left) was a water engineer in Shipdham when he met his future wife, and Mrs Olley (right) worked at a fireworks factory in Swaffham. They are both pictured here in 1965, the year he proposed

Mr and Mrs Olley left together and 
then started going out. And on Saturday, he recreated the date - without
 Edna - by hiring out Dereham Cinema, to celebrate half a century of 
being with his wife.

The day
 out was a surprise to Mrs Olley, who said: ‘Gordon gave me a card on my
 birthday, on August 19, with a note saying you will have a surprise day
 out on August 30.

‘I
 never expected anything like this. When I got out of the car and saw 
the balloons at the cinema I just burst into tears. It’s a lovely thing 
to do and it brought back so many golden memories.’

Mrs
 Olley said of their first get-together: ‘My friend Edna was going out 
with Gordon at the time and she asked me to join them at the cinema. We 
all went in together and I came out with him.

‘I stayed good friends with Edna afterwards so she was okay with everything.’

Special celebration: Dereham Cinema, part of the Hollywood Cinemas local chain, opened especially for the Olleys and staff went in earlier than normal to screen A Hard Day's Night for the couple

Wedding: On August 19, 1967, which was her 18th birthday - three years after their first date - they married

Mr Olley forked out the princely sum of 36p for the three cinema tickets in 1964. The couple strolled along to Dereham Funfair after the film before Mrs Olley caught the 9.30pm bus home to Swaffham.

Mary Olley

Their second date was a dance at Swaffham Assembly Rooms a week later, before they went to the cinema in King’s Lynn on their third outing.

Mr Olley proposed at Aylsham Market a year later. And on August 19, 1967, her 18th birthday - three years after that first date - they married.

The Olleys, of Wendling, near Dereham, have three sons - David, 45, Stephen, 44, and Matthew, 38. They also have five grandchildren - Jake, 17, Tazmin, 14, Amy, 14, Morgan and Lewis, both 12.

Mr Olley was a water engineer in Shipdham when he met his future wife, and Mrs Olley worked at a fireworks factory in Swaffham.

Movie: A Hard Day's Night was a 1964 release directed by Richard Lester, which starred the Beatles - John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr

They both retired last summer after running Breckland Photographic in Dereham since the late 1980s. Mr Olley was a photographer there while Mrs Olley worked on the front desk.

'I bought a copy when it was released on DVD and the people at the cinema have been so nice to let us do this'

Gordon Olley

Mr Olley dreamed up re-enacting their famous first date some ten years ago.

‘Back then they didn’t think they would be able to get hold of the film,’ he said. ‘I bought a copy when it was released on DVD and the people at the cinema have been so nice to let us do this.’

Dereham Cinema, part of the Hollywood Cinemas local chain, opened especially for the Olleys and staff went in earlier than normal to screen A Hard Day’s Night for the couple.

Deputy manager Sharon Neale said: ‘We’ve never done anything like this before. But it’s such a lovely thing for them to do and we were only too happy to help.’
