Hong Kong leader CY Leung
said  residents of the  city
should be more like sheep after a year he said was 'rife with
differences', including months of violent
pro-democracy street protests.

Leung was delivering a Lunar New Year message to mark the 
Year of the Sheep in the Chinese calendar that is
based around 12 animals of the zodiac.

He said: 'Last year was no easy ride for Hong Kong. Our society was
rife with differences and conflicts.

Unrest: Hong Kong leader CY Leung has called on resident in the city to be more like sheep after a year of sometimes violent anti-democracy protests (above) in the Chinese-controlled city

'In the coming year, I hope that all people in Hong Kong
will take inspiration from the sheep's character and pull
together in an accommodating manner to work for Hong Kong's
future.'

He described sheep as 'widely seen to be mild and gentle
animals living peacefully in groups'.

Chambers dictionary describes a sheep as 'a creature that
follows meekly, is at the mercy of the wolf or the shearer and
displays tameness of spirit'.

Chinese officials have repeatedly stressed the need for a
harmonious society in the former British colony, which returned
to Chinese rule in 1997.

Hong Kong returned to China under a 'one country, two
systems' formula that gives the city more autonomy and freedom
than the mainland and a goal of universal suffrage.

But Beijing's refusal to grant a fully democratic election
for the city's leader in 2017 infuriates pro-democracy activists
and politicians who blame Leung for not standing up for their
rights.
