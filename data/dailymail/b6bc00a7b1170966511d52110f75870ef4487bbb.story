Tragic: Helen Hipkiss, 39, was working as a teaching assistant in Barrow, Cumbria when she was taken ill

A healthy mother-of-two collapsed as she taught at an infants’ school and later died of a brain haemorrhage.

Helen Hipkiss, 39, was working as a teaching assistant at Brisbane Park Infant School in Barrow, Cumbria when she was taken ill.

Despite the best efforts of the medical team at Furness General Hospital over the next 24 hours, the decision was taken to turn off her life support machine.

Helen’s husband, Jason, and their two children, nine-year-old Adam and Yasmin, seven, have been left devastated.

Mr Hipkiss said: 'I was at work and got a phone call to say Helen had collapsed. She had the car at school so I ran and went to the hospital in the ambulance with her.

'I stopped with Helen on Wednesday night and on Thursday afternoon the consultants carried out formal tests which confirmed she was brain dead.

'Helen was kept on life support in order for the organ donations to take place on Friday. It’s what she would have wanted.'

The family, of Walney Island, Cumbria, were meant to travel to Belgium on Monday for a week’s holiday.

He said: 'That’s what’s so shocking about all of this, she’s never had anything wrong with her. She never smoked, didn’t drink a lot... she really looked after herself.

'She’d carried a donor card since Adam was born, we’d talked about it quite a lot and I countersigned the card.

'When it became clear she wasn’t going to come back, the doctors said they wanted to talk to me about something and I knew what it would be so I told them ‘Helen carried a donor card’.

'I talked to the rest of the family about it and we were all in agreement that something good could come out of what has happened to Helen.

Happier times: Jason and Helen Hipkiss on their Wedding Day at St Marys Church, Walney - the church is set to be packed once more when friends, family and colleagues gather to say goodbye to Helen

'That was the kind of person she was - thoughtful, selfless and always thinking of others.'

Mr and Mrs Hipkiss, who met at the town hall where they both worked, married in 1998 at St Mary’s Church on Walney.

The church is set to be packed once more at 10.45am on Tuesday when friends, family and colleagues gather to say goodbye to Helen.

Helen’s parents, Dorothy and Harry Wrathall, said they have been touched by the number of cards and phone calls from friends, family and colleagues.

Mrs Wrathall, 80, said: 'On Thursday the doctors said they would turn off the machines because there was nothing more that could be done.

'In my heart I’d known on the Wednesday she had gone. So we went up and sat with Helen and said our goodbyes.

'They took her to theatre for the organ donation, then Jason came back and he didn’t speak. We were all in shock that she had gone.... you don’t expect to see your children go before you.'

Mrs Hipkiss had worked at the social services offices in Abbey Road before becoming a teaching assistant to work with children with special needs, first at Ramsden Infant and Nursery School and later at Brisbane Park Infant School.

Headteacher at Brisbane Park, Pat Burton, said: 'She loved her job and everyone loved her.

'She had a lovely personality and she was a really bubbly person and very good at her job. She got on with everybody and was very well-respected.

'The whole school community is devastated.'
