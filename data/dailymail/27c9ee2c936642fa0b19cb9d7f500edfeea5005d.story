Teenagers were warned to expect a shock when they get their A-level results today after a crackdown on resits.

This year they had to take the exams in one sitting instead of being able to sit them a second time to boost grades.

This could leave many faring worse than expected, said experts. Previously pupils were able to try papers in January and then again in June.

Some pupils getting their A-level results today have been told to expect a shock after a government crackdown on resists which allowed pupils to sit modules once in winter, then again in summer to boost grades

But they were only allowed to use the summer sessions in a Coalition drive to end the ‘resitting culture’ of many schools.

Analysts have predicted the changes will lead to a dip in the number of top grades. Any fall in A* and A grades would be the third consecutive drop after more than 20 years of relentless rises.

Education expert Professor Alan Smithers warned: ‘With the removal of the January exams, candidates this year are going to be examined on the whole year.

‘Taking the exam at the end of the course is probably going to be more difficult because you have got the whole year’s work to understand. 

'You cannot take the exam in January and if you’ve dipped have another go at it, so that they may tend to push the results down a bit.

‘The change from 2013 to 2014 means that it will be a bit of a shock to some students who got their eye in on the old arrangements and now suddenly find they have to cope with a whole year’s work.’

The comments of the professor, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, follow a previous alert by Ofqual.

The exams watchdog has warned that results at both A-level and GCSE will be ‘particularly volatile’ in 2014. This year is also expected to feature the biggest university clearing round in history.

The squeeze on top grades comes in a year when there has also been a fall in the number of 18-year-olds and an extra 30,000 university places made available.

Even elite institutions are set to enter the annual scramble to fill spare places, hoping to pick off the best applicants.

 The combination of factors could benefit students who slip grades as they could get into sought-after universities after all.

While any dip in good grades is expected to be slight, the impact on individual schools and pupils could be more dramatic.

Schools which relied heavily on resits to boost final grades and failed to adapt quickly are expected to be the worst hit. Those which made less use of the resit window are likely to see little change.

Ofqual has pledged to ensure that national results are ‘held steady’ to avoid disadvantaging candidates in the first year of the new system. But it expects a ‘greater variation’ between schools.

Nationally, pupils are expected to pass around 26 per cent of A-levels at grades A or A*.

But schools which made heavy use of resits could see the proportion of pupils getting good grades plummet.

Professor Smithers added: ‘They are going to try and hold the national result pretty much the same, probably a bit down, but the make-up of the schools contributing to that overall pattern will be different.’

Independent schools are expected to be least affected by the change as they are believed to have entered more pupils for end-of-course exams.

The worst-hit are expected to be those which encouraged students to resit AS-levels – the first half of an A-level course.

‘The ASs have been important for university admissions and a lot of effort would have gone into getting those as good as possible,’ said Professor Smithers. ‘There was quite a lot of opportunity in the past.’

Glenys Stacey, chief executive of Ofqual, has warned that schools will be affected differently depending on how they structured courses.

Those where pupils already sat exams at the end of their courses were less likely to be hit.

Nansi Ellis, a senior official at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: ‘We wait to see what the impact of the removal of January exams has had on students who could not take one unit early this year.

‘This change will have put students under a lot more pressure as January exams gave them the chance to complete part of their course and track their progress.

‘We hope that students have not been disadvantaged because of this move to an end-of-year exam. It has been introduced with no trialling and has put increased pressure on a system that is already creaking.’ 

The number of A-levels awarded A* or A tripled between the early 1980s and 2010, hitting a record high of 27 per cent in that year and in 2011.

But top grades dropped marginally to 26.6 per cent in 2012 following the introduction of measures aimed at controlling grade inflation before dipping last summer to 26.3 per cent.

Research by the Mail has found that most universities in the elite 24-strong Russell Group are preparing to enter clearing this year while many other institutions also expect to have more places available. 

Russell Group universities will mainly be battling it out for students with ABB grades after the Government allowed unrestrained competition for applicants with these marks.

Some parents are offering their children incentives of up to £2,000 for achieving an A* and £1,500 for an A grade, according to a study by Leeds Metropolitan University.

Boys have been offered £183 on average for doing well against £124 for girls.

Some 11 per cent of youngsters have been offered a laptop, 11 per cent a car and 10 per cent a holiday.
