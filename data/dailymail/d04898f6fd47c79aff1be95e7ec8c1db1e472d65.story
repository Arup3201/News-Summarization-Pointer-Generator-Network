An Israeli archaeologist who discovered that his relatives were killed at Sobibor has used his skills to shed new light on the dark history of the notorious Nazi death camp.

After learning that two of his uncles were murdered at Sobibor Yoram Haimi launched a landmark excavation project at the site of the camp in east Poland, where some 250,000 Jews are believed to have been murdered by the Nazis during World War II.

Unlike other locations that were given at least a facade of being prison or labour camps, Sobibor - along with neighbouring camps Belzec and Trenblinka - was designed specifically for the mass extermination of Jews, with victims transported to the site in cattle cars and gassed almost immediately.

Sobibor was bulldozed to the ground by the Nazis in 1943 in an attempt to cover their tracks, but Mr Haimi has managed to pinpoint the location of the gas chambers where hundreds of thousands of people were sent to their death over an 18 month period.

The Nazis leveled the camp and replanted over it following an uprising at the site in 1943. This, combined with the fact that there were so few survivors of Sobibor - only 64 were known - has made researching Sobibor famously difficult.

Researchers were able to gain a limited understanding of how Sobibor operated from partial German documentation and the memories of the few survivors that did live to tell their tale - but there has never been an authentic layout of the death camp.

'I feel like I am an investigator in a criminal forensic laboratory,' said Mr Haimi, 51.

'After all, it is a murder scene.'

Over five years of excavations, Haimi has been able to remap the camp and has unearthed thousands of items; including jewellery, keys and coins that have helped him to identify some of Sobibor's formerly nameless victims.

The heavy concentration of ashes uncovered at the site has led the archaeologist to believe that far more than 250,000 Jews were actually killed at the death camp.

'Because of the lack of information about Sobibor, every little piece of information is significant,' Mr Haimi told Associated Press from his home in Israel.

'No one knew where the gas chambers were. The Germans didn't want anyone to find out what was there, but thanks to what we have done, they didn't succeed.'

The archaeologist said the most touching artefact uncovered by his investigations was an engraved metal identification tag belonging to a six-year-old Jewish girl murdered at the camp.

Mr Haimi called Lea Judith de la Penha - whose death at the camp was confirmed by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial - the 'symbol of Sobibor'.

'The Germans didn't discriminate. They killed little girls too,' he said.

'This thing [the tag] has been waiting for 70 years for somebody to find it.'

Haimi's digs, backed
by Yad Vashem, could serve as a template for future scholarship into 
the Holocaust, in which the Nazis and their collaborators killed about 6
million Jews. 'I think 
the use of archaeology offers the possibility of giving us information 
that we didn't have before,' Deborah Lipstadt, a prominent American 
Holocaust historian from Emory University, said.

'It gives us another 
perspective when we are at the stage when we have very few people who 
can speak in the first person singular.'

On the subject of whether the archaeological evidence points to higher death toll at Sobibor than previously thought, she said: 'It is not out of sync with other research that has been done'.

Mr Haimi's
basic method is similar to what he does at home in Israel, where he does digs for the country's antiquities authority in the south - cutting out
squares of land and sifting the earth through a filter.

Because of the 
difficult conditions at Sobibor and the sensitive nature of the effort, 
he is also relying on more non-invasive, high-tech aids such as 
ground-penetrating radar and global positioning satellite imaging.

Traces of the past: Mr Haimi and his team have uncovered thousands of personal items belonging to Sobibor victims over five years of excavations

Based
on debris collected and patterns in the soil, he has been able to 
figure out where the Nazis placed poles to hold up the camp's barbed 
wire fences. That led him
to his major breakthrough — the mapping of what the Germans called the 
Himmelfahrsstrasse, or the 'Road to Heaven', a path upon which the 
inmates were marched naked into the gas chambers.

He determined its 
route by the poles that marked the path and from that, he determined where 
the gas chambers would have been located. He
also discovered that another encampment was not located where 
originally thought and uncovered an internal train route within Sobibor.
He dug up mounds of bullets at killing sites, utensils from where he 
believes the camp kitchen was located and a swastika insignia of a Nazi 
officer. 

During the course of the excavations he and his Polish partner Wojciech Mazurek, helped by some 20 labourers, have retrieved thousands of personal items belonging to Sobibor victims; from eye glasses, perfume bottles and dentures, to a child's Mickey Mouse pin and engraved jewellery.He
also uncovered a unique version of the yellow star Jews were forced to 
wear by the Nazis, made out of metal instead of cloth, which researchers
determined to have originated in Slovakia.
