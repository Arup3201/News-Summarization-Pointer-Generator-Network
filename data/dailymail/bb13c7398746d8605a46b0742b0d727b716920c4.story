These are the quietly dignified portraits of volunteers who put their lives on the line every time a fire bell rings out.

Volunteer firefighters make up 70 per cent of firefighters in the U.S. - around 768,150 men and women who give up their time to save lives and rescue homes.Â 

From the late veteran firefighter Charles G. 'Jerry' Saeger who served decades with Hastings Fire Department, New York to Daniel Mansdrof who signed up to the same unit aged 18, the shots capture unsung heroes across the U.S.

The collection was shot by renowned photographer Ian Spanier. His broad spectrum of work encompasses American landscapes and portraits including musician Stephen Marley, the cast of Jersey Shore and Steve Tyler.

The portraits have been published in a book written by Marek Fuchs, journalist and volunteer firefighter, entitled Local Heroes: Portraits of Volunteer Firefighters.

Unsung hero: The late Charles G. Saeger, known as Jerry, was with the Hastings fire department in New York first as captain and later as chairman

Fearless: Daniel Mansdrof first volunteered in Hastings when he was 18 years old before joining the department in Charleston, South Carolina
