Situated in a desirable village and with a large  garden and four bedrooms, it would appear an ideal family home.

But Tom and Shirley Wardle have encountered a distinct lack of interest in their property – after five separate out-of-control cars demolished their front garden wall since the property went on the market two years ago.

The newly retired couple say their house and the stretch of road it lies on have become notorious as an accident black-spot. They are lobbying the local council to resurface the road in an attempt to improve drivers’ grip and prevent further accidents.

Frustrated: Tom Wardle, 66, had to repeatedly rebuild his garden wall after five drivers crashed into it in two years. His home sits 75 yards from the apex of a sharp bend in the village which is a notorious blackspot

Although the Wardles live on a 30mph 
stretch of road, their home is close to a sharp bend which continually 
catches drivers out, especially in wet conditions.

The couple have knocked £75,000 off the original £350,000 asking price to spark interest in the property, so far to no avail.

Mr Wardle, 66, and his 72-year-old 
wife said the string of accidents – which included two within a few 
weeks last August, requiring their garden wall to be rebuilt each time –
has cost their insurers £15,000.

Mr Wardle, a former shipbuilder, said
he had counted 16 accidents on the road since a car ploughed into the 
wall outside their home in Bretforton, near Evesham, Worcestershire, in 
September 2010.

Number one: The first car that smashed into Tom's property on the 29th September, 2010 leaving bricks strewn everywhere. It happened just months after the couple put their £350,000 home on the market

Number two: The second car that smashed into Tom's property on the 4th April, 2011 is pictured dangerously close to the house. The accident happened at night and house-buyers have been put off buying the property

He said: ‘It is only a matter of time before someone gets really seriously hurt or killed.

‘It would appear the road surface has 
become so worn that as soon as it starts to rain the grip level of the 
surface decreases dramatically.

‘There will be an accident here where a child gets killed. That’s my big fear.

‘I can’t sleep at night because every time I hear tyres screeching I am just waiting for the inevitable smash of my wall.’

The couple put the property, where 
they have lived for 18 years, on the market in May 2010. But they were 
forced to take it off four months later following the crash on September
29, so the wall could be repaired.

Number
three: The third car that smashed into Tom's property on the 4th 
August, 2011. Mr Wardle and his wife say they can't sleep and are afraid
there could be a fatality if nothing is done to improve the road's grip

Number
four: The fourth car that smashed into Tom's property on the 26th 
August, 2011. Mr Wardle has had to drop the price of his house by 
£75,000 but it remains unsold due to the problems with the crashes

Number
five: The fifth car that smashed into Tom's property on the 4th July, 
2012 completely destroys the wall. It was driven by a middle-aged driver
who lost control of his red Ford and careered into the driveway

The couple put the house on the market again in November but withdrew it after a crash on April 4, 2011.

Builders had to repair the couple’s 
wall twice in one month after a car crashed through it on August 4 and 
another car hit it on August 26. The latest crash took place on the 
evening of July 4 this year.

Worcestershire County Council denied the road surface was responsible for the accidents.

Spokesman Jon Fraser said: ‘The 
carriageway surface was inspected last year by a highways team and no 
issues were found. However, in light of concerns raised, we will inspect
the area again.’
