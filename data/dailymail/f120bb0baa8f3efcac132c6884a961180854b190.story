Manchester United stars slammed the substitution of Angel di Maria during a fiery dressing-room inquest after their shocking 5-3 defeat at Leicester.

Di Maria, who had scored an early contender for Barclays Premier League goal of the season to put United 2-0 up, was substituted when the score was 3-3.

During scenes described by one source at the King Power Stadium as ‘very heated’, a United player was heard to say: ‘Why the f*** did we substitute Di Maria?’

The Argentina forward was United’s obvious match winner after his stunning performance against QPR the previous week. But under-fire manager Louis van Gaal, who has won just one game since he took over, withdrew the £60million signing from Real Madrid in the 76th minute.

Leicester were clearly lifted when Di Maria was replaced by Juan Mata and scored twice to seal a remarkable victory.

Van Gaal openly condemned his team in the dressing room following their humiliating defeat and Rafael was also criticised by a number of players for his part in the implosion. The Brazilian defender gave away a 62nd-minute penalty that allowed Leicester to claw their way back into the game.

United left the stadium in such a hurry that they suffered abuse from Leicester fans when their team bus was stuck in traffic near the stadium.

United will not rush to sign a new centre back in January despite their alarming defensive frailties at Leicester.

The shocking manner of their collapse underlined a lack of leadership and organisation and prompted the furious reaction from Van Gaal. Their problems were compounded by an ankle injury to Jonny Evans, their most experienced defender.

United spent £156million in the summer but only £16m on a centre back, Marcos Rojo, who now plays predominantly at left back. The recruitment plan has been branded ‘mismanagement’ by Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher while former United defender Gary Neville said that the side now have a soft centre that all Premier League sides will attack. 

Though United recognise there is an issue, the central defenders who are available are not deemed of good enough quality.

Van Gaal spoke openly about the need to address the departures of Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra if only more for their experience than performances. 

Yet the club had been told that Borussia Dortmund captain Mats Hummels was not for sale, Manchester City had already captured Porto’s Eliaquim Mangala and Arsenal would only deal on Thomas Vermaelen if Chris Smalling was sent the other way.

Dortmund’s stance on Hummels is unlikely to change until the summer while United have reservations about the likes of Ron Vlaar at Aston Villa and Fabian Schar at Basle.

Van Gaal was clear from early August that his priority should be a left-sided centre back with an ability to bring the ball out of defence. He was alarmed that United’s defenders seemed incapable of starting attacks from defence with any real assurance.

Rojo, who played for Argentina in the World Cup final, is highly regarded by Van Gaal and will get his chance at centre back against West Ham on Saturday with Evans out, Phil Jones injured and Tyler Blackett suspended.

Van Gaal said: ‘I think that Luke Shaw shall be fit enough to play. Marcos Rojo can play and Chris Smalling can play, so we can manage. But it’s a thin choice.’

Van Gaal will meet with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward this week, as he does most weeks, and discuss his squad’s progress. He says the whole team is responsible for results such as Sunday’s defeat and not just the defence.

Van Gaal has also indicated that Wayne Rooney’s future lies in midfield. Explaining his selection for Leicester in which Radamel Falcao started and Mata dropped to the bench, he said: ‘I was not so satisfied with Rooney as a striker and Mata as midfielder. That is why I changed. Rooney can play in more positions, he’s a multi-functional player.’

Rooney, talking to Sky, said: ‘I don’t think anyone can put a finger on my best position, but I am adaptable. I can go into midfield, drop out wide or play up front. It depends on where the manager wants me to play.’
