Irreverent customers are treating IKEA stores around the world like a free service to apparently be used and abused with impunity, reports reveal.

Stories coming from across the globe include a child peeing in a Chinese store, a woman vomiting and passing out in an IKEA in Israel, New Yorkers using the shop's creche so they can have a break, Germans dropping their kids off so they can play tennis, and people sleeping in China's stores to escape the summer heat.

The Swedish furniture company has often taken a tolerant stance on the disrespectful behaviour of its customers, its policy being that if people visit the store for other reasons, they are more likely to return to buy something.

But for shoppers who are genuinely there to shop, such behaviour could be seen as off-putting.

Perhaps
the most shocking, and the most recent, of such stories is a 
grandmother helping her son drop his pants and pee into a bottle, while 
supporting him standing on one of the shop's beds.

The
grandmother and her grandson had reportedly both been asleep in the bed. 
When the boy woke up, his grandmother helped him relieve himself by 
holding up an empty water bottle.

According to South China Morning Post, urine dripped onto the new showroom mattress he was standing on.

The news service said the Beijing flagship store, which spans 42,000 square metres, is also awash with people picnicking at any available table and chairs, setting up their flasks and food and leaving behind the rubbish.

And
it is now renowned for the problem of its sleeping 'customers', 
something one worker in the bed section shrugged off, saying: I think 
it's just that shopping behaviour in China is very different,' he told 
the news service.

The 
flagship store has to employ extra staff to change the sheets every 
other day, but business is now booming in the Chinese market, where its 
12 stores pulled in over $7.5 billion in the 2012 fiscal year.

This tolerance towards unruly customers appears to be a global policy.

In
Israel staff concerned for the welfare of an apparently drunk woman let
her sleep off her hangover in a bed after she vomited on a showroom 
couch.

Rather than being 
emitted from the shop, she was allowed to sleep it off and was 
undisturbed throughout the evening until the store was closing.

A statement from the Netanya outlet, quoted in the Times of Israel,
said the woman 'felt unwell when she arrived at the store, and our 
people therefore permitted her to rest until she felt better.

'We wish her the best of health.'

New
Yorkers and Germans alike have been unashamedly using the furniture 
store's free creche to release themselves from the responsibilities of 
parenthood and to have some free adult time.

In Germany, parents have played tennis or got their hair done while kids were dropped off to play at the creche, according to Der Spiegel Online.

And in New York the service is often openly used by parents so they can go for lunch or shop elsewhere, said the New York Times.

Some
people may be abusing the free services of the furniture company, but 
while profits are soaring it seems unlikely its customer policy will 
change.

Gerard Bos, customer relations manager at IKEA UK and Ireland told the Mail Online in a statement:

'As
part of the IKEA shopping experience, we aim to offer a fun day out for
the whole family and we welcome everybody to be inspired by our range 
and to touch and feel our products.

'The
health and safety of all our customers and co-workers is our top 
priority and we trust visitors to use their common sense when in our 
stores.'
