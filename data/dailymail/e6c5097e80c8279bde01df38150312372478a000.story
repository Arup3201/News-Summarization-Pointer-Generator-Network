Ahead of the release of his new movie, Manny Pacquiao has been showing off his acting skills as he put on an impressive Scottish accent.

The boxer was appearing on sports talk show Men in Blazers as he was invited to discuss football, boxing and the release of 'Manny', which will be out on Friday.

During the show the WBO welterweight champion broke into a Scottish accent and said: 'I'm from Scotland and I'm fighting for freedom against the Englishmen.'

Perhaps the Filipino is practicing an audition for the role of William Wallace in the re-make of 'Braveheart'.

Meanwhile, Pacquiao, who is desperate to fight Floyd Mayweather, has set the undefeated American a January deadline to agree their $200million bout.

The Filipino has already agreed terms for the most eagerly-awaited fight in boxing which has been penciled in for May 2 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

But Mayweather has yet to commit to a bout that has been more than five years in the making.
