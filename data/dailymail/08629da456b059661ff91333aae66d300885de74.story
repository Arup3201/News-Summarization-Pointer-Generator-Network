Confession: Sir David Nicholson has revealed that dozens of NHS staff have signed gag clauses

Hundreds of NHS staff forced to sign gagging clauses to stop them revealing poor care and abuse they witnessed in hospitals will at last be free to speak out.

Head of the health service, Sir David Nicholson, has admitted that a new ban on the silencing agreements will also be applied retrospectively, allowing whistleblowers who were suppressed for years to reveal the truth.

The embattled NHS boss yesterday was questioned by MPs about why £15million was handed over to 400 departing doctors, nurses and managers in an attempt to ensure their silence.

He confirmed that 44 former members of staff had signed confidentiality agreements this year at a cost of £1.3million, even though the clauses are no longer valid.

The controversial chief executive said that if necessary he would write to the affected workers to tell them they were now free to speak out.

'If it means writing to all individuals who are involved in this to explain arrangements, that’s what we’ll do,' he told the Public Accounts Committee.

The Mail revealed last week that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had banned gagging clauses with immediate effect to prevent whistleblowers being silenced from raising issues in the public interest such as patient safety, death rates and poor care.

It was confirmed yesterday that these will apply retrospectively to all NHS staff already subjected to them, raising the prospect of an flood of damaging stories about poor care being made public.

The new rules were inspired by the Stafford Hospital scandal, which many believe could have been detected earlier if workers had been allowed to speak out.

Departing staff will be given a new legal right to raise issues that could be in the public interest, such as patient safety, death rates and poor care.

Ban: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week announced that gag clauses would no longer be allowed

‘There has been a culture where people felt if you speak up about problems in the NHS you didn’t love the NHS. Actually, it’s exactly the opposite,’ Mr Hunt said last week.

‘We need a culture of openness and transparency if we are going to stop another Mid Staffs from happening.

'The era of gagging NHS staff from raising their real worries about patient care must come to an end.’

Senior figures in the NHS had warned that the case of whistleblower Gary Walker, who broke a gagging clause to speak to the Mail about high death rates, was the tip of the iceberg.

Mr Walker claimed he was sacked as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals on a trumped-up charge after raising concerns about patient safety.

The father of two said he accepted a so-called supergag as part of a settlement package of an unfair dismissal claim, reported to be at least £500,000, in 2010. He broke the terms to speak out last month about a ‘culture of fear’ in the NHS.

He claimed Sir David Nicholson ignored him when he raised concerns about patient safety in 2009.

Sir David was yesterday quizzed by MPs over the £48,900 he racked up in expenses over the course of last year.

He insisted he needed to travel in first-class trains even when going home to his wife, so that he could work on the journey.
