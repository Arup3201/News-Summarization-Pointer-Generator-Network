Matt Prior ponders the question of how he will remember his career if he is unable to recover from serious injury and play again at the highest level.

‘It’s been wonderful, the best of times to be an England cricketer, and the memories are very special,’ said the three-time Ashes winner. 

‘Working hard, winning games and playing a fantastic brand of cricket. We had an unbelievable environment in the dressing room and it was just great fun.

‘I remember us saying in 2009 that we wanted to create a club cricket spirit in our dressing room, a bit like playing with your mates on a Saturday. Only we just happened to be playing at Lord’s or Old Trafford.

‘It was a fantastic period that I look back on very fondly despite what has happened in the last year. If I don’t get back, and I’ve thought about that, then I can honestly say I’ve achieved most of my goals. Not all of them, but most.

‘Every day before play the coach or captain would say, “Let’s leave everything on the pitch”. And I’ve done that. I’ve run myself into the ground for my team and for my country and if I finish as a player now having done that I can feel quite proud, I think. I can live with that.’

We meet to discuss Prior’s new venture in a very different sporting world but it is impossible to escape his old life at the forefront of a golden period for English cricket which ended so spectacularly and so controversially this year.

Prior has become the co-founder of a professional cycling team at the same time as he faces a very real battle to prolong a cricket career that saw him become one of England’s greatest keeper-batsmen and an integral team man.

The last point is relevant, as are his comments about the ‘fantastic’ team environment, for Prior also unwittingly found himself at the centre of Kevin Pietersen’s bitter attack on the very foundations of what he was most proud of.

No one is attacked as spitefully as Prior in Pietersen’s autobiography, where he was derided as the ‘Big Cheese’ and accused of being at the head of a bullying culture.

Prior has not come to the hotel in London where we meet to talk about Pietersen but it is clear in his first big interview since publication of the book that rocked the English cricketing world that a figure who has always been respected for his selfless attitude feels wounded.

‘It was sad and it hurt,’ said Prior about his treatment in Pietersen’s book. ‘It was a tough time when it came out, for my family as well as me. But we’ve come through it and I’m proud of how I handled it. It’s now time to move on.

‘I know I said at the time that I wanted a right of reply but having had time to think about it I just want to forget it. It’s about doing what is right for the England team. And what’s right for the England team right now is for us all to get behind them in Sri Lanka and at the World Cup next year.

‘We all should want to do anything we can to help them make England fans proud. That’s the important thing. I have moved on now.

‘I’m so excited with ONE Pro Cycling and I’m cracking on with my rehab. All my energy is going into those things. There’s a lot going on in my life and I want to look forward.’

It is ONE Pro Cycling that has helped him cope with an achilles injury that proved much more serious than first imagined when he withdrew from international cricket last summer in the aftermath of Pietersen’s bile which even included, among other things, an attack on his desire to take a bike on tour.

In just three months, Prior, at 32, has helped set up the new professional team who will be competing at UCI continental level next year, two levels below the likes of Team Sky. Ultimately, he wants to take them to the world tour.

‘I got into cycling a number of years ago when my achilles first began to trouble me because I couldn’t run any more and as time went on I got more and more passionate about it,’ said Prior. ‘The cricket schedules are so crazy that you can’t think about anything else while you’re playing but suddenly I found myself out with an injury and time on my hands.

‘I’m really big on the team environment and the exciting thing for me is that it’s like, “Here you go, here’s your team, see what you can do with it”.

‘What I want to do is provide the structure to allow these guys to succeed and achieve their ambitions.

‘I’m hugely involved, not just an ambassador, as co-founder and every decision that’s been made from the coach, to riders and even the equipment, I’ve had a hand in. That’s important.’

The whole project has taken three months from fanciful suggestion to reality even though the team will not be officially launched until February.

It is a positive end to the most horrible of years for Prior. He was left out of the England team after the Ashes were lost in Perth, battled his way back when Alastair Cook wanted him by his side for the start of the new era but then had to concede defeat to injury after the low point of being beaten in the Lord’s Test by India. ‘It got to the point where I knew I was hurt and I couldn’t play any more, but it was a big decision to stop,’ said Prior.

‘The thing that hurt me was people saying I just carried on because I was scared of losing my place.

‘That definitely wasn’t the case. I’m not like that. The minute I got dropped from the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, I grabbed Jonny Bairstow and went out and worked with him. That’s not me doing it for show or the cameras. I only carried on this summer because I thought I could help the team.

‘I knew I couldn’t carry on after Lord’s and one of the things that got to me most was hearing Cooky after that match saying, “We’re still backing Matt”. But I got to the point where I was spending more time with the physio than I was on the cricket pitch.’

The injury to his left achilles, which had clearly been affecting his mobility at Lord’s, had become acute.

‘The first thing I said to Ben Langley, the England physio, when I came round after my op was, “Will I play again?” He said, “I wouldn’t say you won’t but it’s a lot worse than we thought”.

‘My left tendon was pretty much in two halves. I had a 3in tear a centimetre wide running down the achilles. It was a mess and they had to put the tendon back together. It was a big op.’

He is three months into a six-month rehabilitation that will make or break his hopes of a return to county, let alone international, cricket.

‘I will only know if I can do it again once I get back to playing cricket,’ says Prior.

‘Only when I’ve played three or four days back to back, keeping for a lot of overs, will I know. I don’t want to come back half the player I was. If I can do myself justice and play to 100 per cent of my capabilities then I’m in.

‘If I lose that yard that allows me to perform at the level I can perform at then I will only get frustrated with myself. I’d have to look at it if I didn’t get back to my old standards but, fingers crossed, hopefully that’s not the case.

‘The other option is playing only as a batsman, which is going through my mind, too, because I’m pretty certain I can get back to my level just batting. We will see.

‘The physicality of keeping is very demanding, particularly if you want to embrace that engine room mentality of leading the guys on the field. It’s hard work and physically demanding but that’s what a keeper has to do. That’s your role.’

He does not want to give the impression he is giving up. ‘I’m hugely ambitious to play for England again but it all depends on what level of fitness I can get back to. Playing for your country is the greatest honour and biggest achievement you can get. To stand in the Lord’s dressing room with your name on the honours board is a very special privilege, something you can’t forget as a player.

‘If somebody gave me that opportunity again I would bite their hand off.’

For now he is concentrating on his new team. ‘If you create an environment where people are happy in what they are doing then I believe that’s how to get the best out of sportsmen. It’s our responsibility to produce that for the guys. When you start off as a cricketer you want to play in the Ashes and the World Cup, that’s what drives you, and it’s no different to us.

‘We’re not saying, “We’re going to be unbelievable, we’re going to be the best”. But we do have goals, aspirations and ambitions.

‘The biggest thing in cycling is the Tour de France, so why wouldn’t we set out to get there one day?’

You would not put it past him.
