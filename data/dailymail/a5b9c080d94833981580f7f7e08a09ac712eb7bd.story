The boy band have teamed up with office supplies chain Office Depot in the U.S. to stamp out mean-spirited behaviour among children.

A video of Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson and Niall Horan released on Monday to promote the collaboration already has more than 60,000 views on YouTube.

One Direction are launching a nail polish and stationery range for a schools' anti-bullying campaign

From Zayn's neon yellow to Liam's deep indigo, the shades are sure to appeal to every girl

It shows the boys holding up placards and speaking words of wisdom.

'Join us in being brave and true,' says Liam, while Louis calls for celebration of 'being original and empowered'. Zayn stands up for being 'courageous and unique', while Niall is 'confident and successful'.

Harry Styles said: 'Simply put - choose to live nice.'

The '1D+OD Live Love Move Together Against Bullying' campaign aims to raise £64,000 ($1m) for anti-bullying education in U.S. schools.

The range of products includes five shades of nail varnish, each named after a different member of the band, brightly coloured One Direction 
branded notebooks, pens, stickers and more.

It
will all be sold online from July, and Brit fans needn't despair as the company deliver to the UK.

A cut of sales will fund the programme 'to encourage kinder behaviour among students'.

The cosmetics named after the Kiss You stars are coloured in eye-popping shades of neon lime-yellow for Zayn, sky blue for Harry, burnt orange for Louis, deep fuchsia for Niall and indigo for Liam.

'We're really 
excited to partner with Office Depot and help spread the anti-bullying 
message with our fans and students in schools across America,' said Niall Horan, as reported in The Sun.

'And you know we're not long out of 
school ourselves so we can relate. It's a problem that's fresh in our 
minds and we're eager to raise awareness on this subject.

We hope the video will help raise awareness, especially since it will be played at our concerts across America.'

One Direction recently launched their debut fragrance Our Moment in London.
