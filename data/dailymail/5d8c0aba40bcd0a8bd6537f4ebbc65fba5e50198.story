She was 16-years-old and desperate to serve king and country.

Dorothy Bell already had a brother in the RAF and every day there were reports of the war in Europe, feats of great heroism abroad and news of friends signing up for service.

So she told the authorities she was 19 and wangled herself into the Women’s Auxiliary Territorial Service, handling secret messages and transporting some of the most senior officers.

White lie: Dorothy Bell was 16 when she said she was 19 to join the Women's Auxiliary Territorial Service

Secrets: She handled top secret messages during the Battle of Bulge in The Ardennes in 1944 and 1945

Had she not done so she would probably have missed the war.

But
 that little white lie she told in 1942 will resurface today – when she 
is awarded France’s highest honour in recognition of her service.

Lance
 Corporal Bell, now 88-year-old Mrs Dorothy Hickman, is believed to be 
the only woman veteran being presented in person with the Legion 
d’Honneur during a ceremony in Normandy.

‘I’m very proud to receive it but I’m 
still not going to tell them my real age,’ she said yesterday. ‘I don’t 
want to get into trouble.’

She is one of more than 600 veterans 
who will receive the medal as a symbol of France’s gratitude to those 
who helped liberate it from Nazi occupation and fought to serve French 
interests.

Dorothy had 
initially planned to join the Royal Navy ‘but I didn’t like the hats’, 
she said with a twinkle in her eye yesterday.

The ATS, which later took on the future Queen, Princess Elizabeth, accepted Dorothy without any checks on her age.

She
 became a secretary and chauffeur attached to Field Marshal Montgomery’s
 21st Army Group as he oversaw the Battle of Normandy and continued the 
campaign in north west Europe.

Part of her duty involved driving 
senior officers behind the lines and handling secret messages at a 
chateau in Belgium, where she was based during the Battle of the Bulge.

Honour: Lance Corporal Bell, now 88-year-old Mrs Hickman, will be handed the Legion d'Honneur today

She still doesn't want to reveal her real age for fear of getting into trouble 70 years on from the war

Historic: Dorothy is believed to be the only woman veteran to receive the Legion d'Honneur in person

‘They wouldn’t let women on the front line,’ she said. ‘Monty didn’t like that. But I wanted to do something.

'I
 only told my parents after I’d signed up because they would probably 
have tried to stop me. My father said: “Well you’d better make a good 
job of it.”

Mrs Hickman, 
originally from Surrey, returned to marry and raise a family in 
Yorkshire, where she and her husband owned and ran a guest house.

She
 will wear her ATS beret and three British campaign medals for the 
presentation in Caen – leaving space for a fourth one from France.

Experience: Dorothy (second from left) was deployed to Omaha Beach in France to chauffeur senior officers

Advice: After telling her parents she had signed up, her father said 'well you better make a good job of it'
