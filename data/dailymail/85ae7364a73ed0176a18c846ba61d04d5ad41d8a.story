Osama bin Laden's relatives have bought the Carrara quarries to their collection

It is the creamy white stone that built Marble Arch and was selected by Michaelangelo to give form to Christianity’s most cherished characters, including his masterpiece, David.

But now, the Carrara quarries, which still produce the world’s most sought-after marble, are set to finish in the hands of the Bin Laden family.

The devout Muslim relatives of the dead Al Qaeda chief, one of Saudi Arabia’s richest families, wish to add the top quality quarries to their collection of 26 marble mines worldwide.

Oil rich Saudi Arabia is already one of the world’s biggest consumers of marble.

And
 it was the Bin Laden’s construction company that was awarded the 
contract to build the mosque at Mecca in the 1950s that houses Islam’s 
most holy shrine, using hundreds of tonnes of marble.

Now the Saudi moguls are concluding negotiations to buy out the shares of three Italian families for a reported Euro 45 million.

The
 families have already signed a letter of intent, which would give the 
Bin Laden’s Construction Products Holding Company 50 per cent of the 
control over one of the leading quarrying company in the area, Italian 
newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano reported.

Osama
 Bin Laden was one of 53 children of Mohammed Bin Laden, a Yemeni émigré
 who built up a vast commercial empire, with close business ties to 
former US president George Bush. He died in 2011 at the hands of US 
marines.

The quarries, 
which have existed since Roman times, employ around 5,000 people and are
 a crucial economic asset at a time when Italy is struggling to lift 
itself out of recession shipping out 1.4 million tons a year, worth 
around €300 million (£250million) annually.

It was reported by US weekly that at Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's recent wedding in Florence after the ceremony, the guests sat at a 70-metre-long marble banquet table - a gift from master craftsman Gualtiero Vannelli who used marble from the Tuscan quarry in Carrara.
