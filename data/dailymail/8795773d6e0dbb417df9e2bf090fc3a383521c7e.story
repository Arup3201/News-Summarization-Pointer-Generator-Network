Chelsea Manning has spoken out for the first time since she was sentenced to say that she is not a pacifist - after learning that a peace award had been accepted on her behalf.

Manning, who was previously known as Bradley Manning, was sentenced to 35 years in prison at Fort Leavenworth in August for releasing 700,000 sensitive government documents to Wikileaks.

She said that she was 'shocked and frustrated' to learn that she had been awarded the Sean MacBride Peace Award for her actions, explaining that she was in fact a 'transparency advocate'.

Releasing her statement to The Guardian, she also thanked her supporters for referring to her as female after saying in August that she wanted to undergo hormone therapy to transition to a woman.

Speaking out: Chelsea Manning, pictured in an undated handout from the U.S. Army, has said that she is not a pacifist after learning that she had been granted a peace award for leaking government documents

'From my perspective at least, it's not 
terribly clear to me that my actions were explicitly done for "peace",' she wrote in the October 7 letter.

'I
don't consider myself a "pacifist," "anti-war," or (especially) a "conscientious objector". I'm a "transparency advocate".

'I feel that the public cannot decide what actions and policies are or are not justified if they don't even know the most rudimentary details about them and their effects.'

In the statement, Manning added that she
had been flattered to receive the award but wished to set the record 
straight that there had been a 'disconnect' between public perception of
why she had carried out her actions and her real reason for carrying 
them out.

Subject: Concerns Regarding 2013 Sean MacBride Peace Award

I'm very concerned about a substantial disconnect I discovered between what I've experienced in the last few weeks, and what's occurred in the rest of the world. The most obvious disconnect has to do with the 2013 Sean MacBride Peace Award that was supposedly accepted on my behalf.

Now there exists the possibility that there might be more false impressions out there in regards to how I feel about the [peace] award, how it ties to my actions in 2010, and who I am.

From my perspective at least, it's not 
terribly clear to me that my actions were explicitly done for "peace". I
don't consider myself a "pacifist," "anti-war," or (especially) a "conscientious objector". I'm a "transparency advocate".

I feel that the public cannot 
decide what actions and policies are or are not justified if they don’t 
even know the most rudimentary details about them and their effects.

I'd like to clarify that, as far as I'm 
concerned, I no longer have any rank. And, I'd like to thank everyone 
who has avoided misgendering me and switched to using my new name and 
feminine pronouns.

Thank you,

Chelsea Manning

For full statement, see The Guardian

The award was given to her last month by the International Peace Bureau for her 'outstanding work for peace' in 'revealing information about US war crimes'.

Ann Wright, a retired U.S. Army colonel and a prominent peace activist, accepted the award on her behalf - even though Manning claims she knew nothing of it.

She said that she was first aware of the award when people wrote to her in prison quoting from Wright's acceptance speech.

Wright had suggested that Manning was 'overwhelmed' by the award.

Manning added: 'I accept that there may be "peaceful" or "anti-war" implications 
to my actions – but this is purely based on [Wright's] subjective 
interpretation of the primary source documents.'

Wright told the Guardian she was 'distressed' Manning felt the acceptance speech had represented her inaccurately and apologized.

Manning's lawyer, 
David Coombs, told the Guardian he had told his client about the prize 
and that Wright would be accepting it when it was announced in July.

He 
suggested that Manning had possibly confused the award with another 
event.

In the letter, 
Manning added that no future statements coming from her lawyer should be
deemed official, and only ones signed by her on letterheaded paper 
should be accepted as official.

At
the end of the statement, she signed as Chelsea Manning and thanked 
'everyone who has avoided misgendering me and switched to using my new 
name and feminine pronouns'.

Manning, who is expected to be behind bars for at least eight years, added that since the trial she has been 'trying to decompress and focus on other things after a lengthy and exhausting court-martial process'.

Anger: Her issue was with the Sean MacBride Peace Award which was accepted on her behalf by Ann Wright (pictured), a retired colonel of the U.S. army. Wright apologized to Manning following the statement

The material Manning leaked in 2010 included video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed at least two civilians - a Reuters news photographer and his driver.

The former intelligence analyst was found guilty last month of 20 crimes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, as part of the Obama administration's unprecedented crackdown on media leaks.

But the judge acquitted her of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole.
