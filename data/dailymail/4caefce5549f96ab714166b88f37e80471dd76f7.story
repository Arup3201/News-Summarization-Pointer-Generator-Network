The number of Americans living in poor neighborhoods has skyrocketed in the last decade - and nowhere is the trend more prominent than in the South, where more than 30percent of the population is concentrated in an area with high poverty.

A grim new report from the U.S. Census Bureau shows a solid band of high poverty neighborhoods - running from Arizona east to North Carolina. Only Florida and Virginia are spared from the trend.

The data show that poverty in the United States isn't just growing, it's becoming more concentrated - which can exacerbate social problems and lower the chances of social mobility.

The Census report points out that the number of people living under the federal poverty line - less than $24,000 a year for a family of four - has increased between 2000 and 2010. The number of Americans living in poverty climbed 45percent to 45million.

A band of poverty: More than 30percent of Americans living from Arizona to North Carolina live in neighborhoods with at least 20percent poverty

North Carolina and Tennessee had the biggest increase in the number of residents living in poor neighborhoods. Louisiana, West Virginia, Hawaii and Alaska were the only states where the figure decreased

However, the number of Americans living in 'poverty areas' - neighborhoods where more than 20percent of residents are impoverished - has increased even more dramatically.Â 

A quarter of the U.S. population, 77million Americans, lived in poverty areas in 2010 - a shocking 56percent jump from the 2000 census.

In the South, the trend is eve n more dramatic. Nearly 31percent of Southerners live in poor neighborhoods - an increase of 62percent from 2000.

The Census report says that people who live in high poverty neighborhoods face an array of problems - even for those are earning decent wages.

'Problems associated with living in poverty areas, such as, higher crime rates, poor housing conditions, and fewer job opportunities are exacerbated when poor families live clustered in high-poverty neighborhoods,' the authors write.

The percentage of residents living in poverty areas increased in every state except Louisiana, Hawaii and Alaska. The rapidly-gentrifying District of Columbia saw a decline of 6.7 percentage points.

North Carolina, Tennessee and Oregon as the biggest jump in percentage of residents in poor neighborhoods. The figure grew 18 percentage points, 16 percentage points and 16 percentage points, respectively.

In some counties of Texas, the Deep South and Kentucky more than 80percent of residents live in poverty area. In many states in the Northeast, there are no counties with more than half the population in poor neighborhoods
