A prestigious New England boarding school that counts a King, a Nobel Prize laureate and scores of congressmen, sports stars and actors among its alumni has become embroiled in a teacher sex scandal.

Deerfield Academy, a $50,000-a-year school in Franklin County, Massachusetts, has notified police after an ex-student came forward with claims that a retired maths teacher had 'sexual contact' with him in the 1980s.

On Monday, the academy alerted students, alumni and their parents with a notice on its website, stating that the former teacher, Peter Hindle, had admitted to inappropriate relations with students during his 44 year tenure.

However the 78-year-old, who taught at the school from 1956 to 2000, told the Boston Herald he will dispute the allegations, saying he only 'gave someone a back rub' and that sexual conduct was 'all in interpretation.'

The school counts Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriend Conor Kennedy as a student and boasts high profile alumni including King Abdullah II al-Hussein of Jordan, billionaire philanthropist David H. Koch, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and actor Matthew Fox.

In Monday's statement, head of school Margarita Curtis and president of the board of trustees Phillip Greer said they were writing to inform the Deerfield community of 'deeply troubling news.'

'A former student has confided in us 
that he was subjected to sexual contact, in the 1980s, by Peter Hindle, 
who was a Deerfield faculty member,' they wrote. '... We are now conducting a detailed investigation of Mr Hindleâ€™s years at Deerfield.

'While
the reported behavior occurred many years ago, we realize that it 
continues to cause great pain. There is no greater violation of our 
values than broken trust between student and teacher.'

The
officials added that the school has retained lawyers and appealed to 
anyone else who may have suffered abuse to come forward.

Hindle said he was also consulting with a lawyer.

'I think it's all in interpretation,' he told the Boston Herald of the allegations. 'It depends on what you mean by sexual contact. I gave someone a back rub. I don't even know who it is.'

Hindle told the newspaper that he discussed the claims with the school's attorneys on Monday.

But said he had no idea which former student made the allegations.

'I've given a number (of back rubs) over the years,' he said. 'I can't tell you.'

The Northwestern district attorney's office said it is not involved in the matter.

The 600-student school was founded in 1797 and also educated numerous Rockefellers, 1990 Nobel Prize winner physicist Henry W. Kendal and David M. Childs, the architect behind the new One World Trade Center skyscraper in New York.

Deerfield Academy, the school now facing claims of 'sexual contact' between a teacher and student in the 1980s, has turned out scores of famous alumni in its 200-year history.

The academy is an independent, coeducational boarding school in Deerfield, Massachusetts.

A four-year college-preparatory school, it has approximately 600 students and about 100 faculty, all of whom live on or near campus.

Alumni include King Abdullah II al-Hussein of Jordan, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, billionaire and 1984 Vice Presidential candidate David H. Koch and 1990 Nobel Prize laureate physicist Henry W. Kendal.

Deerfield also educated numerous Rockefellas, David M. Childs, the architect behind the new One World Trade Center skyscraper in New York, and actor Matthew Fox as well as scores of congressmen, ambassadors and sports stars.

Taylor Swift's former flame and Conor Kennedy is a current student at the school, which costs just under $50,000 a year for boarding students and $35,920 annually for day students.
