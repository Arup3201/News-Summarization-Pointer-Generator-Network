Britain is facing an 'autumn chill' over the coming days as temperatures are predicted to drop into single figures in some parts of the country.

Wind from Scandinavia and the Arctic will send the mercury as low as 2C in parts of Scotland while the Lake District and Cumbria could hit lows of 4C. 

Forecasters have even warned there could be a chance of sleet in hilly areas as summer draws to a wet and cold close.

Brave: The Brighton and Hove Sea Swimmers wade into the water below the pier for their daily swim. Parts of the South Coast experienced highs of 18C today

Relaxed: A woman reads her book while reclining on a deck chair on Brighton pier, enjoying what could be one of the last days of sun this summer

The conditions look set to remain unsettled until next weekend, with showers expected alongside the blustery conditions.

Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather Services, told The Daily Express: 'Temperatures are really backing down over the next week, right down into single figures or freezing in places bringing some frosts. 

'There will be some thick early morning mists and chilly winds as air comes into Britain from the Arctic region. There is a real autumn chill on the way, feeling more like October than August for at least a week.'

The cold snap comes after former hurricane Bertha unleashed a week of sudden heavy downpours and extreme weather.

However, in some parts of the South East today, highs of 18C prompted people to visit the beach, with sunbathers making the most of the glimpse of sunshine in Brighton.  

Music fans also arrived at Hylands Park in Chelmsford, Essex, and Western Park in Staffordshire for the first day of V Festival under relatively clear skies. 

Around 90,000 people are expected to descend on the two sites over the weekend - and face the prospects of showers tomorrow.

Fans will however try and not let the rain spoil the acts, with the likes of Justin Timberlake, The Killers and Paolo Nutini set to take to the stage.   

The Met Office has confirmed the UK saw almost the entire normal rainfall for August during the first half of the month with 3.4ins so far. 

However the average temperature is slightly above average at 15.2C, but the cold snap could bring that down.
