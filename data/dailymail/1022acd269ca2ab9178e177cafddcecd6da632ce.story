A vaccine which protects against a potentially deadly form of meningitis should not be offered to children in the UK, immunisation experts have said

Campaigners have condemned plans to prevent  children from having a life-saving  new vaccine on the NHS.

Ministers have been told it would not be ‘cost-effective’ to give routine jabs against meningitis B.

In Britain there are 1,870 cases of meningitis B each year and up to 200 deaths, half among the under fives.

As many as 400 children are left with 
serious lifelong complications such as limb amputations, blindness, 
deafness and brain damage.

Vaccination programmes have been used 
for pneumococcal meningitis and the C and Hib strains, but there is 
currently no B vaccine in the UK.

Bexsero targets a large number of the 
1,000 strains of the disease and was hailed as a breakthrough when it 
was licensed this year.

But an independent panel says it would
not be cost-effective – despite having no price for the new vaccine – 
as the disease is on the decline.

The decision by the Joint Committee on
Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) means worried parents must buy the 
vaccine privately.

Campaigners say Britain has one of the
world’s highest rates of meningitis B. In trials of 7,500 people, the 
new vaccine produced antibodies against three-quarters of meningitis B 
strains, suggesting it would give strong protection. Health Protection 
Agency teams helped test the jab.

Myron Christodoulides, reader in 
molecular bacteriology and microbiology at Southampton University, said 
he accepted there were uncertainties about the jab, but if efficacy 
predictions are correct its use could have saved 60 to 80 lives this 
year.

Meningitis Trust chief executive Sue Davie said: ‘In terms of cost – what price can you put on a life?

‘[It] should be negotiated between the
drug company and Government because it needs to be on the NHS to save 
the greatest number of lives.’

The JCVI says Bexsero’s efficacy ‘has 
not been established’ and it is ‘highly unlikely’ to be cost-effective. 
It will take more evidence before finalising its advice in October.

Manufacturer Novartis said it was not asked about cost by the JCVI.

Andrin Oswald, of Novartis, said: ‘We 
expected to have tough negotiations – but we did not anticipate a 
decision saying the vaccine isn’t wanted at all, no matter what price.’

In April it was announced every child 
in England and Wales will have yearly flu jabs, even though the illness 
is very rarely fatal in children.

Meningoccocal B (pictured) is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in this country and one of the most deadly. It poses the toughest challenge for scientists because there are so many strains to target

Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health, said: 'This is a very difficult situation where we have a new vaccine against meningitis B but we lack important evidence.

'We need to know how well it will protect, how long it will protect and if it will stop the bacteria from spreading from person to person.

'We need to work with the scientific community and the manufacturer to find ways to resolve these uncertainties so that we can come to a clear answer.'

Dr David Elliman, immunisation representative for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: 'Nobody doubts that meningococcal B disease can be catastrophic and that all reasonable means should be taken to prevent it.

'However, before introducing a new vaccine or drug, it is important to be sure that not only is it safe and effective, but bearing in mind the increasing financial pressures on the NHS, it also has to be cost-effective.

'Money spent on the vaccine is money not spent on something else. Unfortunately, evidence on these points is either lacking or conflicting.

'It should be possible to fill some of these gaps in knowledge and then the decision should be reconsidered.'
