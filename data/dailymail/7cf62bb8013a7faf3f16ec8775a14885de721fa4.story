This is the dramatic footage showing the moment a Chinese lantern landed in a recycling plant, sparking a blaze which caused £6 million of damage.

West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service have released CCTV video clips showing a small flaming object which investigators say is a paper lantern floating into the Jayplas recycling facility on an industrial estate in Smethwick, near Birmingham.

The resulting fire ripped through 100,000 plastic bales which were awaiting recycling, sending a column of smoke 6,000ft into the sky.

Labour West Bromwich MP Tom Watson said the lanterns were 'just not safe', and called for a ban of them

West Midlands Fire Service said it had more than 35 appliances at the scene of the blaze

The region's chief fire officer Vijith
Randeniya said the blaze, which started on Sunday, at one point 
stretched resources to such an extent there was a single fire engine on 
standby to cover any other incidents across the West Midlands, with more
than 200 firefighters called in to tackle the flames at the plant.

Mr
Randeniya said he was satisfied after preliminary investigations that 
the cause of the fire was the lantern caught on the site's own CCTV 
cameras.

The blaze sparked 
calls for Chinese lanterns to be banned, with senior Liberal Democrat MP
Tim Farron saying they were 'immensely dangerous'.

The MP, who has been campaigning for 
some time against their use because of farmers' concerns in his Cumbrian
constituency about the impact on crops and livestock, said it had taken
a major incident in an urban area to bring home the dangers of the 
lanterns.

He added it was 'extremely lucky' that no one was killed.

Yesterday, Labour West Bromwich MP Tom Watson said the lanterns were 'just not safe', and also called for a ban.

Mr Randeniya said the Chief Fire 
Officers' Association (CFOA) - of which he is president - previously 
called for a review of the use of the lanterns and said it was time that
'sensible people have a sensible discussion' about the issue.

'We don't want to be party poopers and we know they are used in a lot of celebrations,' he said.

He added: 'We have a situation where a
fire has started here, £6 million worth of loss, started by one of 
these lanterns and that was eminently preventable.'

The CFOA said it wanted an 'urgent 
review' of the law over the use of paper lanterns, while farming, 
agricultural and maritime groups called for measures to curb their use.

Farmers
with livestock have complained that spent lanterns often land in fields
where their wires can injure animals, while coastguards have reported 
incidents when they have been needlessly called out on false alarms when
the lanterns have been mistaken for ship distress flares.

The
Smethwick fire, in which 11 firefighters suffered minor injuries, 
continues to burn today with the fire service estimating crews could be 
at the site until at least tomorrow.

Mr
Farron, who is MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale and Lib Dem party 
president, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'It is laudable for 
governments to take their time and be cautious about banning things but 
the evidence now very strongly points towards that ban.

'This could be repeated again and it could have a loss of life attached to it which would be an absolutely appalling tragedy.

'I think all of us would feel utterly, utterly appalling if we had failed to take action when we had the chance.'

Paper lanterns have been blamed for causing a myriad of problems. Farmers with livestock complain lanterns often land in fields where their wires can injure animals, while coastguards say they have been needlessly called out when the lanterns have been mistaken for ship distress flares

The blaze, which started on Sunday, demanded more than 200 firefighters to tackle the flames

He went on: 'They are spectacular things so I am loath to ban them or to seek to ban them. But they are immensely dangerous.

'The Spanish, who are a pretty fun-loving group, have banned them in recent years as well because of the impact on livestock, on crops and indeed property and potentially the threat to life.'

He added: 'The clamour for action to be taken has come originally from the farming community. It has taken an incident like this in an urban environment to really bring this to the headlines.

'I don't think governments should be knee-jerk in outlawing things but, if you look back, I have been doing this for some time alongside others, like the NFU.

'I think the majority of MPs have perhaps only become aware of this recently because the majority of MPs don't represent rural constituencies where this is deemed to be a bigger threat.'

Downing Street played down calls for a ban.

'The actual number of fires caused by Chinese lanterns is very small,' a No 10 spokesman said.

'It is important that we always ensure that there is a proportionate response to any event and we always look at safety matters and make sure they are kept at the top of our concerns.'
