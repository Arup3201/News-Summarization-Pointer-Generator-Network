When the local zoo in the western Siberian city of Barnaul decided to add to its animal quota, they decided that what would enhance its visitors’ experience would be a boomer – a male kangaroo.

Thus Chuck was welcomed to its new home last summer and zoo director Sergey Pisarev checked its passport to ensure all was in order.

‘Chuck was born on March 19, 2012. It was initially very active, cheerful, ate the usual food: apples and dandelions,’ said Mr Pisarev.

Then came the bombshell.

‘Zoo staff called me this morning and told me that a cub appeared in his pouch. Everyone was shocked,’ said the director.

Kangaroo pregnancies are a hit and miss affair by all accounts and can easily be missed.

‘The embryo develops into a pouch, and it is almost impossible to understand the whole process.

The cub is six inches now and is well. Its mother probably needs to be renamed Chucky Chuck,’ Mr Pisarev added.

The young mother and the baby live in a heated room. When the average night temperature in the street rises above 10 degrees, they will be released into a cage.

‘We're going to buy another kangaroo. Right now we want to buy a male to create a complete family,’ the zoo director said.
