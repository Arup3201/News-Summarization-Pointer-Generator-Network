An Australian glamour model has come out swinging at a men's magazine after they apparently misquoted her in an article which accompanied her racy photoshoot.

Juliana Cameron claims during the interview - which accompanied the six-page swimsuit spread - she told the reporter she was not a party girl and doesn't smoke, drink or have sex.

However, in their July 2013 issue, they ran a quote which said: 'I've got absolutely no problem with being naked anywhere', alongside an image of her straddled on the ground in a white singlet and red G-string.

The magazine has reportedly offered Cameron, from Sydney, a private apology over the incident but she is pushing for them to issue a public statement.

The racy shoot also featured Cameron in an array of skimpy bikinis, and one shot showed her pouring water over herself from a red watering can.

In a petition launched in the past few days the bikini model has branded the magazine's conduct as 'a form of sexual violence against women' and says it is 'a form of gender based discrimination and a form of violence against women'.

Cameron said the false claims they printed about her was 'unethical' and said the magazine was creating 'a rape culture against women who have body confidence'.

'During the interview I shared that I'm actually not a party girl, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke and I'm also celibate too,' she wrote alongside the petition.

'The men's magazine proceeded to misrepresent my interview and made false representations about me, which is a form of sexual violence against women.'

'Women can have both body confidence and boundaries. Women deserve to be safe regardless of whether they are wearing a bikini or wearing an eskimo suit.'

A year after the spread was published she has been issued with a personal apology from Zoo editor Shayne Bugden, according to news.com.au, but Cameron said she went through a huge ordeal just to get to that, and it took up a lot of her time and resources.

'Zoo was making all these false representations about me and as a result I ended up getting sexually harassed by the male readers of the magazine,' Ms Cameron told the website.

She said it was not up to Zoo to decide how to represent her body and said the situation was a 'male abuse of power'.

The personal apology apparently acknowledged that the glamour model was in fact misrepresented, but Cameron is pushing for a public admission of Zoo's alleged wrongdoing.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Zoo for a comment but they are yet to respond.
