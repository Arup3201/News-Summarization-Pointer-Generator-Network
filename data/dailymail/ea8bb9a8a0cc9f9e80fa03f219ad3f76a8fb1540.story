Manchester United believe they have made a breakthrough in their attempts to land Holland international Daley Blind.

Manager Louis van Gaal, who is also hot on the trail of Sporting Lisbon centre-back, Marcos Rojo, wants Blind to join his Old Trafford revolution.

And United chiefs were last night growing increasingly confident of striking a deal with Ajax for the versatile Dutchman, who is valued at £20million.

Presence: Blind impressed for Louis van Gaal's Holland during this summer's World Cup in brazil

The one that got away: Van Gaal had also been interested in Thomas Vermaelen, but Barcelona got their man

Van Gaal has been forced to look elsewhere in his pursuit of central defenders after Thomas Vermaelen chose Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund's refusal to consider selling Mats Hummels.

Blind impressed in Holland's World Cup campaign under Van Gaal, and the new United manager wants the 24-year-old with him next season.

Ajax manager Frank de Boer has admitted he is open to selling Blind this summer, saying: 'If he goes to a big club then he has definitely deserved it.

'But I think it would be better if he stays one year. Last year was a good year for him but I think he can improve a lot with us.

Could move: Blind has admitted that a move to one of Europe's top clubs would be too good to turn down

Impressive: Blind, who scored against Brazil at the World Cup, could continue to improve at Ajax, said De Boer

Signing: Louis van Gaal wants to make Blind part of his Old Trafford revolution as soon as possible

'If a club comes along with a lot of money it is almost impossible to say no. But we won’t let him go for free that is for sure.

'It is important for the player and the club that there is no tension or that it happens at the last minute.'

Blind himself said: 'I am happy here in Amsterdam. But if there comes another club I will have to think about it and then we will see. I will think about my options.

For now I will focus on Ajax and we will see what happens next week.'
