Conservative grassroots organizations are seething today over the inclusion in a government spending bill of a campaign finance measure that will allow wealthy Americans to give more money to political parties.

Concerned that the measure will have the practical effect of redirecting funds away from their groups to the national party, Tea Party organizers denounced the $1.1 trillion spending bill that narrowly passed the House on Thursday evening and GOP leadership in Congress.

While Republicans are traditionally in favor of removing caps on political donations, the rider has conservatives that are normally in favor of the free flow of money aligned with progressive groups that seek to limit it.

Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night: A visibly elated John Boehner walks to the House chamber on Thursday night for a vote on the $1.1 trillion spending package to keep the government open through the end of the fiscal year. The House is headed home for the holidays now that it passed the all-important legislation

At issue is a measure in the gargantuan appropriations legislation that would raise the amount that individual donors can give to the national parties from $32,400 a year to $324,000 a year. 

The provision calls from the party committees to create three separate accounts to which individual donors can give up to $97,200 a year. One fund would go toward building costs for the Washington, D.C. based organizations. Another would be allotted to costs for the presidential nominating conventions. The third would go toward general expenses.

Right-wing groups have long argued that the government should not be able to regulate how much money its citizens are allowed to give to political causes and that political donations are a form of free speech covered by the First Amendment.

On the liberal end of the spectrum, progressives consistently bemoan the influence of big spenders on the political process and have supported greater restrictions on political spending by individuals and corporations.

But the changes to political giving for establishment groups has Tea Partiers up in arms this week out of fear that it will hurt their fundraising efforts and weaken their ability to hold the Republican Party accountable.

'What congressional leaders are doing is what they do best: protecting incumbents and the two-party system. The omnibus rider will only strengthen the Washington establishment in both parties and not create a level playing field for candidates who are outside the Beltway,' Citizens United President David Bossie said in a statement on Thursday.

Citizens United is notably the group that fought and prevailed against the Federal Elections Commission in 2010 at the Supreme Court over the amount of money that nonprofit organizations could put toward independent political expenditures.

The landmark decision opened the floodgates to so-called dark money in politics, its critics charge.

Individual donors may give only $5,000 a year to Political Action Committees, PACs, under FEC rules, however, they're allowed to write blank checks to Super PACs that do not have to disclose their deep-pocketed donors.

The nifty accounting measure has created an avenue for wealthy Americans to leave their mark on politics and given Tea Party endorsed candidates an edge at times over their establishment competitors.

'Conservatives support the First Amendment and believe there should be no limits on political speech,' Ken Cuccinelli, president of the Senate Conservatives Fund, told Politico on Thursday. 

'Unfortunately, the new limits included in the omnibus only increase political speech for party insiders while silencing the majority of Americans who are fed up with Washington,' he said.

The two men are hopping mad this week over a provision in the omnibus bill that would effectively direct money away from outside spending groups and toward the national political parties

Changed Times: Citizens United President David Bossie, right, meets with reporters outside  the Supreme Court  on Jan. 21, 2010, after the high court ruled in the organization's favor on a campaign finance reform case. The decision allowed the group to spend its money on independent political expenditures. Now Citizens United is railing against a GOP-supported campaign finance measure

The House-originated 1,600 page joint omnibus bill and continuing resolution that contained the offending provision would fund the government through Sept. 30, 2015. 

The provision of the extensive spending legislation affecting political donations made unlikely allies of progressives and conservatives this week as they simultaneously tried to convince their respective voting blocs on Capitol Hill to demand the measure be removed. 

It advanced to the Senate on Thursday, despite objections from both sides of the political aisle, after a day of rancor on Capitol Hill that pitted conservatives against House Speaker John Boehner and Democrats, led by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, against President Barack Obama.

The House on Thursday night passed a joint continuing resolution and omnibus that would fund the federal government through next fiscal year, with the exception of Homeland Security, which it only appropriates money to until the end of February.

The legislation is now under review in the Senate, and the upper chamber's leader has said he hopes to pass the appropriations package today. 

The White House said Thursday that the president would sign the bill if it came to his desk, and the president and his team spent the rest of the day lobbying Democrats to vote yes on the measure.

In the meantime the president signed a resolution keeping the government open through Saturday, giving the Senate more time to pass the long-term legislation.

Hard-right lawmakers refused to vote for the long-term appropriations bill after House leadership rejected their request to include language effectively defunding Obama's immigration orders.

Republican leaders instead limited Homeland Security funding to the first two months of the year and promised conservatives an opportunity to revisit the the topic when the department's funding runs out.

At that point Republicans elected in November will have taken their seats in Congress, giving the GOP full control over the legislative branch.

Staunch conservatives wouldn't get on board with the plan, however, arguing that the omnibus bill offers better leverage than legislation to fund DHS.

Pelosi and many members of her caucus threatened to withhold their votes as well over a measure Democratic groups believe is a sweetheart deal for Wall Street and the dramatic reforms to campaign finance rules. 

'The last thing the American people want is for Congress to give big donors even more influence in politics, but that's exactly what this provision will do,' Nick Nyhart, president of progressive group Public Campaign, said in a statement on Tuesday.

'The biggest donors will be able to buy more access and influence and everyone else back home will continue wondering who their elected officials are working for,' he said.

After some last-minute finagling by the president, who came out in favor of the bill on Thursday, as it included funding for several of the administration's key initiatives, the bill made it through the House and into the Senate with just hours to spare.

The Senate still has to debate and pass the legislation and the president must then sign it, but a government shutdown was staved off when the president signed a resolution extending government funding through Saturday.

Today the upper chamber is expected to sign the bill, allowing lawmakers to close the chapter on the current legislative session.

Even though the legislation was authored in and first passed in the House, conservatives have focused their ire on soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who they unsuccessfully tried to unseat earlier when he came up for reelection. 

Conservative raid host Mark Levin called the rider on Wednesday an 'outrage among many outrages' in the bill and derided McConnell as 'power hungry.' 

'Do you know why he’s doing that? It’s to destroy any conservative any group that seeks to challenge an incumbent, to destroy the entire primary process,' Levin charged.

'That’s what McConnell is up to.'

As McConnell's office pointed out to Politico, however, the Senate leader had little influence over the House bill that was intended to be a compromise between Republicans and Democrats in the House.
