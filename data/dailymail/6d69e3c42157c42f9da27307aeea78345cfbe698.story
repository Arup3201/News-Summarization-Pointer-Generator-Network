Those who say we are abandoning the centre ground of politics could not be further from the truth. The Conservative party is right where we need to be – not just waffling about the issues that matter to people but actually delivering on them.

And I know that few things matter more to people than the NHS and safeguarding it against the storms. When I think of my family and our happiest and saddest memories, I think of the NHS.

From the incredible care and attention we received in Cornwall when our daughter Florence was born almost a month early, to some of the saddest times, staying on the wards where my son Ivan was being treated.

A father's love: Prime Minister David Cameron with his son Ivan, who suffered from a rare combination of cerebral palsy and epilepsy and died in 2009, aged 6

But while they were sad times, I always had what I call the NHS feeling: knowing when you walk over the threshold not just that your child is in safe hands but also that they’ve got access to some of the best care and best specialists anywhere in the world. There is absolutely nothing I would do to jeopardise that.

That’s why I made a big decision before the election to protect the NHS budget. Labour called it ‘irresponsible’. The Liberal Democrats did not protect it either. It was only Conservatives who made that choice. Yes, these are difficult times – but we point-blank refused to cut the budget of the NHS.

Because of the choice we made, this year the NHS budget is bigger than at any point in history – and the results are plain to see. The number of doctors and midwives is up. Mixed-sex wards have been all but eradicated. Hospital infections are down to their lowest rate on record. The number of people waiting more than six months before they start treatment has been cut in half.

But there is more to do. Because the success of the NHS can’t be measured in budget figures and percentage points. It’s about care; dignity; kindness. The nurses who rub patients’ backs, the GP who knows your name, the knowledge that if your mum or dad is on a ward they’ll have someone there to pour them water, keep them fed, make them comfortable and talk to them.

No 'if's, not 'but's, no cuts: The Prime Minister proudly defends the Conservative Party's decision not to make any cuts to the NHS budget

All the doctors, nurses and midwives who have looked after my family have been brilliant. But we know there are too many instances where,  put simply, the care hasn’t been there. From the elderly lady who gets treated like a nuisance  because she wants an extra pillow, to those terrible scandals in Mid-Staffordshire.

And when people have been upset by all this, too often they’ve just been met with a barrage of bureaucracy – the boxes have been ticked and the quotas have been met.

The bureaucracy got bigger than the people – and my mission with the NHS is to change that. We need to focus relentlessly on improving the care people get, and we’re taking some big, practical steps to achieve that.

First, we’re introducing one of the most simple tests that any caring organisation can have. We’re asking staff and patients if they would be happy to recommend the hospital they’re in to their friends and family.

It’s called the Friends and Family test, and the results show in a very human way how a hospital is performing: not just how their budget’s looking; but how people feel about being there.

I’ll never forget going to a hospital in Salford and the staff were so proud at their great results that they stuck them up on the walls of the wards.

They were proud, but they also knew they were going to have to keep it up – and this is how we can change the culture of the NHS.

Second, we’re making sure that more people get the drugs and treatments they need. Years ago, before I was Prime Minister, I was stopped on the street by a man called Clive Stone. He had cancer, he couldn’t get the life-saving drugs he needed and he said: ‘If you ever get into Number 10, please do something about it.’ And we have.

One of the first things I did was set up the Cancer Drugs Fund to get drugs to people who need it – and it’s helped more than 21,000 people so far.

Now we’re taking even more urgent action to help those suffering with cancer. It’s not just drugs people need, it’s other lifesaving treatment – like innovative radiotherapy that can more accurately focus radiation on the tumour. We are making £15million available straightaway to make sure our NHS staff are trained to give treatments like this. And we’re doing something else. We already have a guarantee for drugs – that if they’re safe, cost-effective and doctors say you need them, you will get them.

From April 2013, for the first time ever, we’re extending that guarantee to radiotherapy too. This is going to help thousands of people at one of the hardest times of their lives.

Alongside all this, we’re bringing in a new Nursing Excellence Fund, for those who are right on the front-line of caring for people. It’s going to give £100million to get new time-saving technology on the wards, so nurses spend less time box-ticking and fiddling about with medical records and more time on caring for their patients.

It’s just one of the practical steps we’re taking to make the NHS stronger and better for everyone who uses it.

So this is what you get from the Conservative Party this week. Action, not slogans. Government, not politics. Detail, not waffle.

We are taking the tough, long-term decisions Britain needs today so that we can thrive in the years ahead. And we’re focusing relentlessly on what matters to the back-bone of Britain – the people who work hard and do the right thing.
