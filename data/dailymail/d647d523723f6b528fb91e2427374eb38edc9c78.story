The funeral of four young children who died holding each other in a cupboard as their mobile home burned down around them was held today in Hartsville, South Carolina.

Their mother Hope Kaneshia Hawkins, 21, has been charged with homicide by child abuse after the siblings were found allegedly home alone, where they died of smoke inhalation.

She was arrested last Thursday night after the deaths of four-year-old Delonta Dixon, two-year-old Camaron Mason, and twin 10-month-old girls My'asia and Ky'nasia Hawkins.

'Loving': Camaron Hawkins, centre, and his twin sisters My'asia and Ky'nasia Hawkins. The children's aunt Janice Hawkins said that 'they were loved by all' in the neighbourhood

Charged: Hope Hawkins, 21, had allegedly left the children unattended when the deadly fire broke out

When the firefighters reached the scene last Wednesday at 1:57 pm Hope Hawkins was in the front yard outside.They arrived to find over half the mobile home on fire. 

Captain Andy Locklair, spokesman for the Darlington County Sheriff’s Office explained: 'She said she was at home when the fire started and that she had tried to get the children out.

But no one was there. When all the fire apparatus started arriving, I think she arrived then.'

The fire is believed to be accidental
 and started in the kitchen. Rather than escape, it seemed the 
frightened children tried to protect themselves in the cupboard.

'The one thing they teach firefighters is that kids hide in a fire,' Mayor Mel Pennington, also a volunteer firefighter, said.

'They were just so loving and caring and the whole neighborhood know them and they're loved by all,' their aunt Janice Hawkins told ABC KTRE.

The town held a candlelit vigil for the children on Friday night and their funeral service took place on Wednesday, with their young cousins as pallbearers.

The mayor said that the children's deaths had deeply moved him personally: 'First, being a father before I am a mayor, I extend the condolences of our city to the family that is struggling to deal with this tragic loss.'
