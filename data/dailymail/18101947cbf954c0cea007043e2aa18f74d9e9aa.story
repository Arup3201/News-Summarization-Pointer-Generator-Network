A family watch on in horror as bulldozers smash their home to make way for sewage pipes for the Olympic village in Russia.

Sergei Khlystov and his son-in-law Maxim Samokhval tried to block the bulldozers at first but stood aside and watched as their two-storey house in Mirny, Sochi was destroyed in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

Mr Khlystov’s family is one of at least 1,500 in the path of bulldozers clearing for the Games, which less than 500 days away.

While Mr Khlystov, 55, may have lost his house, the distress does not stop there. He has failed to prove that the family owned the land on which their house was built, a condition for resettling in a new house in exchange.

Mr Samokhval’s wife, Tatyana, even appealed to the local priest as well as the local authorities.

Mr Samokhval said: ‘She went to the spiritual authorities and the secular authorities. 

‘One said “pray” and the other said “sue”.’

On bailiff orders, half his house was bulldozed a few days before workers, accompanied by police, returned to finish the job on September 21 even though the family continued to live there with Mr Somokhval’s children, aged three and eight.

All along the stretch of the Black Sea coast, houses have been pulled down and thousands of people resettled in the Olympic building boom that has overtaken the city of 340,000 people in the shadow of the Caucasus Mountains.

The Russian Government has spent a reported 15.5 billion rubles (£307.14 million) before the end of 2011 to resettle 90 per cent of the people whose homes had been demolished.

For President Vladimir Putin, the Games are a prestige project that will allow him to showcase Russia's ability to organise major events and boost its international image.

He regards the event as an important 
element of his new presidential term as well as a chance for the 
country, which will also host the 2018 World Cup soccer finals, to show 
off its sporting prowess.

Construction
of the Olympic venues and infrastructure alone is expected to cost more
than £3.7 billion, and half of this will be privately financed. 

The
final bill for hosting the Olympics in Sochi, most of whose spas and 
resort hotels date from the days of Stalin, who died in 1953, is likely 
to end up much higher.

Construction of the sports facilities is about 70 per cent complete, officials say.

New
homes are being provided for Sochi residents displaced by the 
reconstruction of their town but such is the importance of the project 
that people who do not want to move, have no option but to get out of 
the way of the bulldozers.

Olympic construction: The 'Fisht' Olympic stadium under construction in August is one of six stadiums which is part of an estimated venue and infrastructure construction bill of more than £3.7billion

Nearly there: With the Games less than 500 days away, construction of the sports facilities is about 70 per cent complete

The New York-based watchdog, Human 
Rights Watch, urged the International Olympic Committee to intervene, 
saying ‘the illegal eviction of a family in Sochi casts a dark shadow 
over preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games’.

Other
Sochi residents have complained that compensation has in some cases 
been arbitrary, and some have accused the local authorities of damaging 
the environment and harming wildlife.

Just
out of sight of Mr Khlystov’s garden is the Iceberg stadium, one of six
stadiums to be built in the complex as venues for ice event and Olympic
ceremonies.

Hotels, sports
facilities and general improvements are under construction in the city,
and work is going on in the mountains above Sochi where other events 
will be held.

Some Sochi residents are happy with their new homes given to the m in exchange for being uprooted.

Viktor Altunyan, an employee in the 
Sochi department of culture, was moved from a small house in Mirny to a 
newly built village a short distance away near the border with Georgia's
Abkhazia region.

He now 
lives in a house more than twice the size with his mother, wife and 
young child, surrounded by almost identical homes decorated with similar
paintwork.

He said: ‘The president's words came true for me,’ referencing Putin's pledge that people should not be moved into worse housing. 

‘It's better here in terms of location and utilities, electricity and water. It's only positive.’

He says he no longer misses his old house, which he built himself and lived in for 15 years.

Dmitry Chernyshenko, President of the Sochi 2014 Organising Committee, told reporters in Moscow: ‘The state built villages, perfect houses. I don't have such a house. 

Without commenting on the Khlystov case specifically, he said: ‘Sometimes people built buildings without any permission on land which did not belong to them.

‘They are trying to earn money from the state.’

About
180 cases will be settled in court, most of them disputes over house 
valuation, Saurin said. In cases where cash compensation was not 
provided, the government had built seven new residential developments 
and apartment blocks, he said.

Plea to intervene: New York-based watchdog, The Human Rights Watch, has urged the International Olympic Committee to intervene

In cases where cash compensation was not provided, the government had built seven new residential developments and apartment blocks, he said. 

Mr Khlystov said he had lived in Mirny for more than three decades since being given some land there in the Soviet era.

But Oksana Rafalskaya, a spokeswoman for the Krasnodar regional government's Olympic department, said the Khlystovs had never established the right to use the land for a residence so it remained government property. She said Khlystov's extended family had been offered flats as compensation.

Nina Shishimorova, a neighbour of the Khlystovs said: ‘When the construction is over, it will be better.

‘We already have roads and they've started picking up the rubbish again. Compared to the way the rest of Russia is living, we don't live too badly.’

Such construction and resettlement programmes are not unusual for an Olympics. Rights groups criticised China for forced evictions before the 2008 Beijing Games, with some estimates indicating that 1.5 million people were moved, many against their will. 

The Chinese government said the demolition of homes in parts of Beijing earmarked for development before the Olympics was carried out fairly and legally.

A few London residents were also rehoused because of construction work before this year's Olympics in Britain.
