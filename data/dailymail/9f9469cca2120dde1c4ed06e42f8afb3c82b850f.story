A beauty queen has won a competition to be the face of a lingerie brand after proving she has an 'intellectually stimulating' personality as well as good looks.

Belle Et Bonbon launched a search for a model to star in their latest advertising campaign earlier this year and asked applicants to prove they were smart as well as sexy.

After 1,000 women applied, they have now revealed the winner as Camilla Hansson, 25, from Sweden.

Winner: Camilla Hansson is the new face of lingerie brand Belle et Bonbon after they launched a competition to find the most 'intellectually stimulating' model

Beauty queen: Camilla was crowned Miss Sweden 2012

The Nordic beauty is a former Miss Sweden and has represented her country in the Miss Earth pageant.

But to win the chance to be the face of Belle Et Bonbon, she had to prove she is more than just a pretty face.

Applicants were told that if they 
were short-listed for the London casting, they would need to show their intellect, as well as be fitted in their lingerie.

However, testing their brainpower did not involve undertaking an IQ test or passing a quiz on general knowledge. Instead, the candidates were interviewed on their life and career achievements, creativity, ambition and wit.

Most 'intellectually stimulating': The Nordic beauty beat two doctors, a physicist, and two Oxbridge graduates to take the title

To be reach the interview stage, hopefuls had to provide a picture of themselves and describe their 'proudest moment', their 'definition of what it means to be intellectually stimulating' and their 'intellectually stimulating heroine'.

Camilla, who has no academic qualifications,
 impressed the judges to be chosen as the winner, beating two doctors, a physicist, 
and two Oxbridge graduates in the final shortlist of fifty.

She
 told MailOnline: 'I love beautiful lingerie, and I saw an advert for 
the Belle Et Bonbon search online, and submitted my entry, although I 
didn't expect to be short-listed, let alone be named the face of the 
brand.

Champion: Camilla said it was a lovely surprise' to win the competition which sought women with  'character, wit, ambition and style'

'I had to go along to an interview 
with a panel from the brand to talk about my business career, my 
ambitions and my achievements, as well as model the lingerie. I thought 
it was a bit of fun, and didn't have any hopes for it, but was invited 
back to the final round of interviews, where we went into even more 
detail.

'Then, 
amazingly, my phone rang a couple days later to tell me I was to be the 
new face. I'm still getting over the surprise, but it’s a lovely 
surprise.'

When 
launching the competition the brand stated on their website that they 
were looking for 'women with character, wit, ambition and style'.

They added: 'The sexiest, most seductive asset a woman possesses is her intellect, and we at Belle Et BonBon are seeking a new campaign face who has both the prowess and the gravitas to represent our brand.'
