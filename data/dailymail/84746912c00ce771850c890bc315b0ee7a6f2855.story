In five weeks time Las Vegas will pay host to the biggest boxing match in history when Floyd Mayweatehr Jnr and Manny Pacquiao roll into town for their $300million mega fight.

It is an evening Amir Khan desperately wanted to be involved in after repeatedly calling for Mayweather to take him up on his challenge to dethrone the undefeated American.

It hasn't kept the Bolton-born boxer away from the bright lights of Vegas, however, as he was pictured at 1 Oak Nightclub in the Mirage Hotel and Casino on Friday night.

Khan, who has yet to agree his next opponent after missing out on securing a bout with Mayweather, believes the American will emerge victorious against Pacquiao on May 2.

Khan told Sky Sports News: 'It's going to be a great fight and I think five years ago it would have been ever better because they were both at their peak and it was a fight that everyone was dying to see.

'Since then Manny Pacquiao has had two defeats. He’s been knocked out once by (Juan Manuel) Marquez and then he got beat by (Timothy) Bradley which was a little controversial, but I think Mayweather will take the fight.

'He will be much smarter and he’ll pick his shots a little bit better. He’ll make it a little boring at times because Manny, as we know, is a come-forward fighter who likes to do a lot of punches.

'But Mayweather will try to avoid all those punches and just maybe throw that one shot that will count and then move away again. But time will tell.

'I’ve been watching Mayweather train on social media and he has been training very hard so he might come up with a different gameplan this fight, something that we have not seen before.
