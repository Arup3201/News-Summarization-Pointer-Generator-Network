Three airline pilots were asleep at the same time in the cockpit of a packed Heathrow-bound transatlantic passenger plane, shocking new testimony from flight crews reveals today.

A dossier of shocking cases of pilot fatigue have been released by the British Airline Pilots' Association (BALPA) in a bid to urge the Government to block changes to working hours imposed by Brussels.

The alarming dossier of fatigue cases is 
published today as the pilots’ leaders accuse ‘unelected’ EU 
Commissioners of trying to force through ’insane’ new flying hours rules
which they say will put passengers’ lives at risk by leaving more 
fatigued pilots asleep in their cockpits.

In the dossier, one pilot also told how, on an another occasion, he had woken up alone in the cockpit of a delayed night-flight after his colleague fell asleep in the toilet.

Another spoke of how he and a colleague messed up a landing at Heathrow ‘with possible fatal consequences’ because they were ’punch-drunk with tiredness.’

And a pilot flying from Miami to Heathrow filed an anonymous ‘whistle-blower’ report after he awoke from his own ‘tuned out’ sleep to find his colleague slumped in his seat after ‘nodding off.’

But pilots also said they didn’t always report cases ‘for fear of reprisals.’

Pilots’ leaders claim that Brussels’ proposed ‘unsafe and discredited’ changes to flying hours and rostered rest-periods will increase the chances of tired flight crew nodding off – sometimes simultaneously – at the controls of their aircraft .

The new EU rules would allow pilots to land a plane after going 22 hours – and sometimes 24 hours – without sleep, they complain.

Up to one in six pilots have already experienced flights where both pilots have nodded off simultaneously, their own research shows.

But they say the European Parliament is being asked to rush through automatically the ‘unsafe and unscientific’ changes in a vote next Wednesday despite rejection of the plans last week by their own EU Transport Committee and in the face of widespread opposition in the UK and across Europe.

The British Airline Pilots’ Association says: ’It is a scandal that the unelected and unaccountable European Commission can force through cuts to UK flight safety.’

They say the EU vote is already rigged in favour of the rules being passed automatically on the nod.

Last week the European Parliament’s Transport Committee voted by 21 to 13 to reject the EU plans.

And MPs in the UK have also criticised the changes which are nevertheless backed by the Government and the Civil Aviation Authority.

Now the BALPA has sent a new report to ministers detailing the extent of pilot fatigue to UK Transport Secretary Patrick McLaughlin ministers, the CAA and the EU.

The testimony also follows publication by the CAA of an incident report from a Virgin Atlantic pilot flying an Airbus saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days. But the pair were not asleep ‘simultaneously’.

A BALPA poll revealed more than half (56 per cent) of British pilots admitted they had fallen asleep in the cockpit with 1 in 3 of them also saying they had woken to find the other pilot also asleep.

A spokesman for BALPA said: ‘British pilots have urged the UK Secretary of State for Transport and flight safety regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to protect our skies and today have sent them a detailed breakdown of how the new EU rules will cut British flight safety by increasing the tiredness of pilots.

‘A dossier of personal testimonials from UK pilots giving first-hand accounts of the severe tiredness already experienced by pilots under current higher-quality UK standards has also been sent to the Minister and CAA .’

But the organisation says: ‘The European Commission has ignored this and is requiring the full European Parliament to confirm the rejection of the unsafe and unscientific rules in a vote on Wednesday.

Worried: Louise Ellman who chairs the influential all-party House of Commons Transport Committee agreed with BALPA's concerns

‘Half of the entire European Parliament must vote to reject the new rules to stop them automatically coming into place, rather than just those present for the vote on Wednesday, when many MEPs are expected to have already left Strasbourg ahead of a recess. ‘

It adds: ’This would mean that unsafe new EU rules cutting UK flight safety.’

BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan, said: ‘It is a scandal that the unelected and unaccountable European Commission can force through cuts to UK flight safety that have been rejected by MEPs on their own Transport Committee, UK MPs, pilots across Britain and Europe, scientists and the British flying public.

‘We are urging UK MEPs, the Government and Secretary of State for Transport to keep British skies safe for passengers and urge the Commission to go back to the drawing board.'

Louise Ellman who chairs the influential all-party House of Commons Transport Committee and is  Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside said:’I agree with Balpa's concerns that the proposed changes to EU rules could endanger air passenger safety.

'There is still time for the UK Government and Europe to think again.’

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘We will continue to support the adoption of the proposed regulation as it will improve safety across the EU.

‘The CAA - the UK's specialist aviation safety regulator - is satisfied that the proposed requirements will improve safety across the EU as a whole.

'Flight-time limitation requirements are there to ensure that pilot and other crew members do not operate aircraft with unsafe levels of fatigue.

‘The proposed requirements go further than current requirements by obliging airlines to plan rotas and manage crew duties to actively address the risk of fatigue occurring in the first place.’
