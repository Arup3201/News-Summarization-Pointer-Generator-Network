Pharrell Williams has hit back after a court ruled Blurred Lines breached copyright rules, warning 'We'll lose our freedom to be inspired'.

Speaking for the first time since a court ruled he and Robin Thicke had copied a Marvin Gaye song to create the hugely catchy single, the singer said the effect could seriously stifle creativity. 

He warned the entertainment industry could be 'frozen in litigation' after a jury determined he and Robin Thicke had copied Marvin Gaye's 'Got To Give It Up' to create the biggest hit of 2013.

Pharrell told the Financial Times: 'If we lose our freedom to be inspired we're going to look up one day and the entertainment industry as we know it will be frozen in litigation. 

'This is about protecting the intellectual rights of people who have ideas.

'This applies to fashion, music, design . . . anything.'

He added: 'The verdict handicaps any creator out there who is making something that might be inspired by something else. 

Explaining that 'everything that's around you in a room' was inspired by something or someone else, he said: 'If you kill that, there's no creativity.'

He said he and Thicke were considering their 'next steps', but declining to comment on whether or not they would appeal against the verdict.

Marvin Gaye's family filed an injunction in court on Tuesday that could end the sale and distribution of 'Blurred Lines' - the wildly successful song that they claim was ripped off of Gaye's 1977 hit.

The injunction by Nona Gaye, Frankie Gaye and Marvin Gaye III would prevent the copying, distributing and performing of the hit single, which sold millions worldwide and also featured T.I.

Pharrell and Thicke were ordered to pay nearly $7.4million to the three children after a jury determined last week that Blurred Lines copied elements of Gaye's song. 

Gaye's family also sought Tuesday to amend the verdict to include rapper T.I. - whose real name is Clifford Joseph Harris Jr - as well as labels Universal Music, Interscope Records and Star Trak Entertainment.

The injunction against Blurred Lines could give Gaye's family leverage to negotiate for royalties and other concessions, such as songwriting credits.

The family said in a statement released Wednesday: 'With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist.

'It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued.'

The children claim the lawsuit could have been avoided if Thicke and Pharrell had spoken with the family before the song was released, The Wrap reported. 

The family said: 'Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage.

'This did not happen. We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. 

'This also did not happen.'

Blurred Lines was the biggest hit of 2013. It sold more than seven million tracks in the United States, topped the pop charts for months and earned two Grammy Award nominations.
