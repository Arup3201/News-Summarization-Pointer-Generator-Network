Emmanuel Emenike stormed off the field after the Fenerbahce striker was the victim of alleged abuse from his own fans in Turkey.

Soon after blowing a one on one chance with Besiktas' Tolga Zengin After a poor touch to control a long ball, Emenike was booed vociferously by his own fans, with allegations that some of the abuse was also racist.

The Nigeria international appeared to angrily remove his shirt and marched towards the sidelines during Sunday night’s match against rivals Besiktas.

Emineke gesticulated wildly on his way off the pitch, showing his displeasure at the home fans' booing.  

But his coaches on the touchline ordered him to put his top back on and continue playing, pushing him back onto the pitch.

Former Liverpool forward Dirk Kuyt had to calm the striker down as he continued playing, before he was eventually replaced at half time.  

The player was visibly upset by the chanting, and attempted to have himself subbed when it happened

Emenike has endured a difficult time in front of goal this season, netting just four times in 22 appearances, and is not popular in the Turkish capital. 

Senegalese front-man Moussa Sow, meanwhile, scored a dramatic 91 minute winner to secure three points for Fenerbahce. 

The result sees the club remain third in the Turkish Super League table with 53 points from 25 games, two behind the pace of first-placed Galatasaray.
