The Aaron Hernandez murder trial moved out of the courtroom on Friday as jurors toured several key sites in the case including the industrial park where the victim's body was found and the former Pats player's home.

Lawyers for Hernandez agreed to remove personal and religious items before jurors toured his home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts.

Hernandez is accused of the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, 27, who was dating the sister of his fiancée Shayanna Jenkins.

The former NFL star has pleaded not guilty to murder.

Prosecutors cited the O.J. Simpson case in complaining that Hernandez's home, still occupied by his fiancée, had been changed to add items that might play to jurors' sympathies. 

Simpson's home was manipulated before jurors in his murder trial visited to add family photos and a Bible.

The defense lawyers confirmed to the judge on Friday morning that the home had not been staged or manipulated. 

Friday's tour also will include visits to the street where Lloyd lived in Boston, the industrial park where Lloyd's body was found, and four cellphone towers.

Jurors left the court on a bus, escorted by a state trooper.

Hernandez was not allowed to go on the view and it was unclear if his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, would be present at their home.

The jury were then driven to Lloyd's home in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The prosecution claims that surveillance tape from a neighbor's home revealed Lloyd getting into a car with Hernandez on the morning he was killed. 

This afternoon, the jury was taken to the industrial park in North Attleboro where Lloyd's body was found.

They were then driven to the Hernandez home, around a mile away from the crime scene. 

Jurors toured the home, including the ex-player's 'man cave' where it is alleged by the prosecution that he kept a handgun.

Defense lawyer James Sultan was questioning a state police trooper about tire pressure on Thursday when he jokingly asked whether the trooper had ever received 'training in football deflation devices' during ex-Pats' player Aaron Hernandez's murder trial

 Before leaving court on Friday, the judge overseeing the murder trial of former  player chastised his lawyer for making a joke about 'Deflategate' while questioning a witness in court.

James Sultan was questioning a state police trooper about tire pressure on Thursday when he jokingly asked whether the trooper had ever received 'training in football deflation devices'. 

On Friday morning, Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh told Sultan that they are conducting serious business, and she does not expect there to be any more jokes. Sultan agreed and expressed regret. 

'Deflategate' was the hot topic in the run-up to the Super Bowl after the New England Patriots were accused of using under-inflated footballs in their AFC championship win. The NFL is investigating.

The Patriots went on to win the Super Bowl last Sunday, defeating the Seattle Seahawks.
