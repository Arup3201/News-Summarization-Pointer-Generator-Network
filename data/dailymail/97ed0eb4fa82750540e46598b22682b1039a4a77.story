Wolverhampton City Council have been accused of wasting money after sending leaflets to residents telling them how to dispose of wrapping paper

Council bosses have been accused of wasting money and paper after sending thousands of leaflets to families asking them to sift through their rubbish for every scrap of wrapping paper.

The festive memo warns people Christmas wrapping paper cannot be re-cycled because it is too shiny.

Wolverhampton City Council's team of binmen delivered 166,000 warning letters commanding residents to put their festive wrapping in the ordinary household waste bin.

The council said binmen do not have time to check through people's Christmas leftovers, so homeowners must do the job for them.

But residents claimed the move was a 'waste of money' accusing the 'cash-strapped' council of spending a fortune producing the 166,000 leaflets, and would act to create a new mountain of paper thrown in the bin.

Council spokesman Gurdip Thandi said: 'Residents are advised not to put wrapping paper in recycling bins as it is often covered in shiny or metallic covering that affects the quality of paper produced in the recycling process.

'However, natural paper without such covering and cardboard rolls can be recycled.'

Early this year - as part of a Â£70,000 communications budget - the council launched a smiling cartoon drinks can called 'Stan Can', informing residents to put the correct rubbish in the correct bin.

It emerged that 'binspectors' were 
leaving on average 300 bins a day in Wolverhampton on the roadside for 
having the 'wrong' waste inside.

Mother-of-one Samantha Rogers, aged 27, from Oxley, Wolverhampton called the Christmas wrapping paper directive 'ridiculous'.

The council's team of binmen delivered the 166,000 leaflets to residents asking them to sift through their Christmas waste for every scrap of wrapping paper, to ensure it is not recycled. The council said the shiny paper causes problems with the recycling process. File picture

She said: 'The household waste bin isn't the biggest, and over Christmas you accumulate more rubbish so with wrapping paper going into that bin it's going to be full.

'People should be entitled to recycle wrapping paper. It's ridiculous.

'With the bin days all over the place at Christmas it's just asking for problems.'

In an online blog another resident, calling themselves 'funny old world', said: 'Cash-strapped... I don't think so.

'They have sent out 166,000 leaflets and they will just go in the recycle bin, it's like throwing money away.'

And a blogger called 'Thehoffsleftsock' added: 'So we can not recycle paper cos (sic) it costs money, so i will send out 166,000 leaflets?, that's saving money isn't it (sic).'

Resident Ivy Trellis said: 'The cost of 166,000 leaflets beggars belief!'
