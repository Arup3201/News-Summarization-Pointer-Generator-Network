Texas Gov. Rick Perry invoked comedian Joan Rivers' death on Sunday while defending a law he signed that would close the majority of abortion facilities in the nation's second-most populous state.

The Republican governor and likely 2016 presidential candidate suggested during a forum that Rivers' death could have been avoided if New York had a law like the one passed in Texas requiring clinics to abide by the same standards of care as hospitals.

'It was interesting that Joan Rivers and the procedure that she had done, where she died, that was a clinic,' Perry told attendees of the Texas Tribune's annual festival in Austin.

'It's a curious thought, that if they had that type of regulations in place whether or not that individual would be still alive,' he said, per a video provided by the Texas Tribune.

Texas Governor Rick Perry invoked comedian Joan Rivers' death while defending a law he signed that would close the majority of abortion facilities in Texas. The Republican  suggested during a forum on Sunday that Rivers' death could have been avoided if New York had a law requiring clinics to abide by the same standard of care as hospitals

Rivers was undergoing a routine procedure at an outpatient surgery center when the 81-year-old entertainer went into cardiac arrest and died earlier this month. Health officials in New York are still investigating. 

The provision of the Texas law that Perry referenced as preventative of fatalities like Rivers' was actually blocked by a federal judge in August and the state of Texas is currently engaged in a court battle to restore it.

Had that requirement taken effect, only seven abortion facilities would remain in Texas — down from more than 40 in 2012. 

Jan Soifer, an Austin attorney representing abortion providers in the lawsuit, said in an email to the Associated Press on Sunday she didn't know the circumstances of Rivers' death, or if Perry knew whether that clinic would have met Texas' proposed ambulatory surgical center requirements.

'I do know that the evidence we produced at trial proved that abortions are among the safest procedures and neither ASCs nor admitting privileges make them any safer,' Soifer said.

Heather Busby, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Texas,  also bristled at Perry's claim, telling the Associated Press in an email that complications can arise from any medical procedure, not just abortions.

'There's risk inherent in just about anything. You could have a heart attack and die while having your wisdom teeth removed. Should we outlaw wisdom teeth removal?' she said. 

The event on Sunday brought out a rare side of Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history, who reflected on 14 years of state policy after spending the past year whipping up conservative crowds around the U.S. for another potential White House run. 

Rather than a fiery speech blasting President Barack Obama, an easygoing Perry mused on his record on schools and jobs. The state's abortion clinic law came up in response to a question from an audience member.

Texas is now asking a federal appeals court in New Orleans to let the state fully enforce its sweeping anti-abortion law, known as HB2. 

That same appeals court previously upheld a section of the law that requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel of Austin ruled last month that making Texas abortion clinics spend millions of dollars on hospital-level upgrades was less about safety than making access to abortion difficult.

Opponents of the law repeatedly extolled the safety of abortion clinics during a four-day trial in Austin, arguing that that only one of more than 500 deaths from pregnancy-related causes from 2008-2012 in Texas was attributed to abortion.

The legal battle will likely continue beyond Perry's third - and final - full term in office, which will come to a close in January of next year. 

Perry reiterated during Sunday's event that he wouldn't announce a decision on whether he'll run for president again until after leaving office.

However, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate has said several times in the past that he's preparing for a run. 

It's likely he'll be one of as many as a dozen Republicans competing for his party's nomination in 2016.
