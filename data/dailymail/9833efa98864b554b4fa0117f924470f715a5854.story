A 'devious' conservatory salesman was convicted yesterday of battering his lover to death after conning her out of £70,000.

David Ryan, 48, battered wealthy businesswoman Diana Lee to death at her luxury home after he squandered more than £60,000 of her savings on high living, including IVF treatment for his wife.

After the killing he mutilated the lower part of 54-year old Mrs Lee's body with a saw before dumping it in her garage and setting it on fire.

to death and set alight by David Ryan, who was found guilty of murdering her yesterday

Firefighters discovered the victim's naked body slumped over a wheelbarrow full of firewood inside the burning garage at her £750,000 property called Parklands in the Cheshire village of Cranage.

Police said she had been killed then mutilated by Ryan in an attempt to destroy evidence of that they had sex the previous night.

The night after the killing he spent the night drinking cocktails and beer with a friend at his local pub.

Married Ryan - a neighbour of Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell - had met Diana whilst targeting wealthy women enjoying ceroc and modern jive dance classes at the Cinnamon Rooms in Bowdon, Cheshire.

He had already had an an affair with one local teacher and had pestered another woman to have a fling with him whilst they were dancing together at the weekly classes.

During their 18 month fling Ryan and Diana - who ran an up market cattery - would have secret trysts and he would ring her her from a telephone kiosk near his home in Hale to arrange their rendezvous - whilst his unsuspecting wife Karen, 50 was at home.

But penniless chancer Ryan had debts of £90,000 and had had his £200,000 home repossessed after the failure of his double glazing and conservatory business.

Divorcee Mrs Lee - who had been nursing a traumatic relationship break up - was thought to have become besotted with Ryan and withdrew £70,000 from her account to help him with his mounting debts - and invest in a fictitious business he said he was setting up .

He later frittered away the cash he took from Diana on designer clothes, exotic holidays, a puppy, extravagant purchases for his rented terraced home, and even used the money to fund his wife's IVF treatment.

He also had a secret pot of £60,000 cash stored at his home, stuffed in socks, hidden under his wardrobe and in his drawers.

It emerged over the course of many years Ryan had borrowed money from virtually every friend, family member or associate - only to fail to pay it back.

Today at Chester Crown Court he was convicted of murder following a seven week trial. He denied murder and will be sentenced tomorrow.

After the case Assistant Chief Constable Ruth Purdie of Cheshire Police said: 'David Ryan gave Diana attention and affection and preyed on her trusting and kind nature for his own ends.

'We now know that his intentions toward Diana were fuelled by greed and Ryan's intention to exploit her financially to try and recover himself from the mountain of debt he faced.

'We have been left in little doubt that Ryan's attack on Diana - a diminutive and gentle lady, was brutal and sadistic. He showed contempt and compounded his disregard for her when he did his utmost to remove DNA evidence and then destroy her body.

'Although Ryan refused to admit his guilt in this horrific murder, the prosecution were able to prove that he concocted a web of lies and brutally murdered a woman who had done nothing more than fall for the charm of a con-man'.

Diana was last seen alive on the evening of 8 August last year, when she met a group of friends for dinner at a Chinese restaurant in nearby Knutsford. She left the restaurant and went to meet Ryan nearby before driving him back to her home.

The couple has sex after which Diana was battered with a blunt instrument in the bathroom. Ryan then dragged her body and her bedding to the garage and set four fires in the building in a bid to destroy any evidence that connected him to the killing.

Ryan even used Diana's mobile phone to send hoax text messages to clients asking them to delay dropping off their pets that morning, to bide himself time at the scene of the crime.

He fled the scene in Diana's silver Vauxhall Corsa, before making attempts to set fire to it in Mobberley and continuing his escape on her pushbike.

The prosecution described Ryan as 'devious' and a 'conman' and said he targeted Ms Lee when he was 'at a particularly low ebb' due to his spiralling debt

The following morning, the victims brother Colin Sherwin, a local farmer, visited Diana at her home, found the detached garage beside the property blowing out plumes of smoke and called for help.

It emerged Ryan had tried to 'frame' Mrs Lee's lodger for the murder by slashing the victim's dressing gown, covering a knife in her blood and planting her underwear in his room.

Police were led to Cinnamon Dance Club and Ryan after examining Mrs Lee's mobile phone.

At the time he denied being in a relationship with Diana Lee, but later admitted having sex with her in her car on the night of her disappearance.

He denied killing her saying he was watching the Olympics on TV at the time of her death.

But bloodied footprints were found by forensics teams in Mrs Lee's home matching the unusual brand of Italian boots worn by the defendant. His DNA was also found on her body.

Ryan described their relationship to police, claiming he and Ms Lee were 'friends with occasional sex'

Ryan's wife Karen Ryan later revealed she woke up alone on the morning of Mrs Lees death and did not recall seeing her husband until two hours after the time of the murder.

In a statement the dead woman's family said: 'It is hard enough to deal with the death of a loved one through sickness, accident or old age but Diana's death was planned.

'Every effort, calculated and brutal, was made by the perpetrator to try and ensure he could not be traced.

'David Ryan has only showed himself to be a coward. He has lied to try and explain away his barbaric crime. He feels no remorse or regret. His selfishness and indifference is no more than contempt for the life he has cruelly snubbed out and the family he has destroyed.

'Diana was a quiet and unassuming person. Nobody had a bad word to say about her. She was a loving daughter and sister. She had a wide circle of friends. She is sorely missed by everyone she knew. She has a left a hole in ours and many people's lives'.
