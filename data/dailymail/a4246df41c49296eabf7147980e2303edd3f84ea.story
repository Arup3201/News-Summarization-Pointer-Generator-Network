A sleepy Chihuahua has delighted his owner with his choice of sleeping arrangement after picking a Great Dane to be his bed.

Clearly unsatisfied with the amount of space available on the provided cushion, the miniature hound was spotted climbing atop the significantly larger dog who was positioned in the ultimate spot beside the heater.

Despite crawling right up to the Great Dane's shoulder, at first the bigger dog didn't noticed his new miniature blanket.

Then, disturbed from his slumber, he appeared indifferent after quickly checking on the Chihuahua.

The dogs' owner could be seen filming the adorable bed-buddies with his phone while they cuddled up for a snooze.

Whilst it may be an uncommon sight, it's not the first time that the smallest and biggest dog breeds have interacted in a surprising way. 

One little Chihuahua proved that size really doesn't matter when he coerced a 50kg Great Dane - more than ten times his size - into a corner in December.

A home video showed the miniature dog holding court in a living room by barking and raising his hackles at his large opponent.

The Great Dane was seen swiftly backing away and jumping up on a couch.

He then watched the Chihuahua with caution from his safe resting place as the manic barking continued. 

The clip was filmed by Matt Sorrells from North Carolina. His family are seen in the video watching the animals in action from the sidelines.
