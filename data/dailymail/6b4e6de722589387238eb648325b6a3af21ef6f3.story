John Coleman is used to having passers-by stop him on the street in 'little puddles of sentiment' commenting on how cute his 'puppy is', to which he replies, 'Tiger is not a puppy, he is three years old.'

Almost approaching his fourth birthday, Tiger, is one of the rare German shepherd's with Dwarfism, a rare genetic disorder found in dogs when both parents carry the dwarf gene.

Expert in German Shepherd breeding, Jodie Carroll, says the mutation is currently found in only 12 per cent of German Shepherd's world wide.

She says breeders should take the mutation seriously and test their studs for the gene.

'It's not cute - from my point of view it's quite distressing and very serious,' Ms Carroll told the Daily Mail Australia. 'They are suffering from a genetic mutation and suffer serious health problems.'

Pituitary dwarfism syndrome in dogs occurs when puppies are born without a pituitary gland and unable to produce the correct amounts of growth and thyroid hormone.

As a result of this mutation, puppies stop growing at an early age and face many health issues such as, shortened life span and problems with growing skin, teeth and adult fur.

The temperament of dwarfed dogs are typically aggressive and anxious , which make for undesirable pets, resulting in breeders usually being forced to euthanize a puppy born with dwarfism.

Tiger's owner John Coleman told the Daily Mail Australia that to euthanize was never an option.

Eight years ago Mr Coleman and his partner Nick had purchased a full grown German Shepherd from breeders Darien and Ken Northcote.

It wasn't until five years later when Mr Coleman received a call from the Northcotes, telling him of their recent breed of genetically mutated German Shepherds and asking him if he would be willing to adopt a mutated dog with dwarfism.

'We did a pretty good job with our full grown dog, Lydia, so they [Northcotes] thought we would be the best people to take on Tiger,' he said.

'The first thing we got from the breeders was a photo of him,' he said. 'A tiny little thing - it was too cute!'

'I didn't want something that ridiculously cute but my reaction was "well what harm could it bring?"'

Typically German Shepherds with dwarfism aren't genetically blessed with the same level of cuteness Tiger possesses.

'We actually won the lottery when it came to dwarfism,' Mr Coleman admitted. 'Ken and Darien specially chose for us the one who was the least obviously affected but we were prepared to have a pretty ugly, little dog.'

John said the Northcotes were completely upfront and forthcoming with the challenges they would face having a dog with dwarfism.

'We got him young enough that he could still bond with the people who matter and our big dog has a good nature so he [Tiger] never got hostile', he said. 'He wasn't over whelmed because there weren't too many of us.'

John attempted taking Tiger to Obedience School, and without surprise, he failed to behave in a social setting, trying to attack the dogs and humans around.

It wasn't until six months of having Tiger, when John and Nick  noticed his temperament changing from timid to full time aggression.

'He became even more aggressive,' he said. 'He is timid around everything, always jumpy and very nervous. When people come over we usually have to put a muzzle on him.

'You think he is full of confidence but in fact it is quite the opposite - his reaction to everything around him is to frighten it away.'

But behind closed doors and in the comfort of his home, Tiger shows his owners a more softer side.

'He is a lovely, affectionate playful little thing while he is at home with us.'

When asked by the Daily Mail Australia on the thought of losing their beloved Tiger, John admits to a being conflicted.

'We can't put him into kennels or be dog-sitted because he is so aggressive so we can't take holidays away and he is quite a burden as far as having visitors goes.'

But about 18 months ago Tiger suffered from an unexplained infection which caused him being rushed to hospital.

'My partner was in tears at the thought of losing him,' he said. 'We are very attached to him - we will miss him dreadfully but there will also be a sense of freedom being able to resume a normal life.'

John said they can't get anyone to look after Tiger and have trouble when they have visitor as he is too aggressive
