Elegant in a pistachio and nude dress, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was every inch the royal style icon as she and husband King Willem-Alexander arrived in South Korea this morning.

The visit comes after the North, led by Kim Jong Un, stepped up its sabre-rattling over the weekend following the launch of a refurbished Soviet nuclear submarine capable of striking Seoul.

Despite the best efforts of dictator Mr Kim, the royal couple appeared undaunted and were welcomed by huge crowds waving Dutch and South Korean flags as they stepped off the plane.

The Dutch royals are fresh from a successful visit to Japan, where they met Emperor Akhito and attended a trade conference.

Formally welcomed by President Park Geun-Hye outside the striking Blue House presidential palace, the royals were all smiles as they, along with the South Korean president, met well-wishers lined up along the red carpet.

Afterwards, they were taken inside where King Willem-Alexander held bilateral talks with the South Korean president ahead of a three-day tour of the country.

Maxima and Willem-Alexander then travelled to the National Cemetery in the capital, which was established by presidential decree in 1956 - three years after the Korean War ended.

The conflict, one of the first of the Cold War, saw British and US troops line up alongside the South Koreans, while the Soviet Empire slugged it out alongside Communist rebels in the north.

Common cause: Like the Japanese tour, the Dutch tour of South Korea is aimed at boosting trade

Eventually, the war, which ended in 1953, resulted in the partition of Korea with the North remaining communist while the South developed into a modern democracy.

Only Korean veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars can be buried there, although the burial ground does have one foreign resident - Briton Francis William Schofield.

During their visit to the cemetery, the couple met Korean War veteran Kwak Kyung-chan, with several others lining up to tell the couple of their experiences.

Although a delegation from North Korea has visited the cemetery, relations between North and South Korea remain frosty with Mr Kim ramping up the belligerent rhetoric over the weekend.

News of North Korea's latest attack submarine also came hot on the heels of photos released of unpredictable dictator Un visiting an air base, where he checked out equipment on a fighter jet and apparently ‘gave instructions’ to pilots.

Tribute: Following the meeting with President Geun-Hye, the couple visited the National Cemetery

Remembrance: There, they paid tribute to the soldiers killed during the Korean War of the 1950s

Split: The war saw the UK and US line up with what is now South Korea against the communists of the north

Respectful: During their visit to the cemetery, the couple met with some of South Korea's war veterans

Honour: Only they can be buried in the National Cemetery, although there is one Briton buried there

According to local news agencies, Un then climbed into the cockpit of one of the pursuit aircraft and congratulated the pilots for their skills before promoting four squadron leaders on the spot.

News of Kim’s visit prompted a South Korean source to remark that the North’s pilots have little experience in air battles and are ‘seized with fear’ at the thought of taking on Seoul’s airmen who have access to far superior technology.

Whether Kim’s visit - his ninth to air force units this year - and the launching of the nuclear-capable submarine was just ‘sabre-rattling’ or a severe warning of troubles ahead was not immediately apparent.

But the work on the 1958 Soviet vessel to bring it up to standards capable of putting to sea and possibly firing ballistic weapons is being watched carefully by South Korea’s military.
