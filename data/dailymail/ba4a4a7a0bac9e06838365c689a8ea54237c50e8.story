A 22-year-old waitress whose legs were severed by a train as she walked home after work was conscious during the ordeal and had to wait three hours in the freezing cold before she was taken to hospital.

Sarah Stott  was walking across a set of tracks as she made her way home in Verdun near Montreal when the train struck her in December.

She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and she also risks losing her fingertips after suffering hypothermia as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures. 

Severe: Sarah Stott, 22, was making her way across a set of tracks on her way to her home in Verdun near Montreal when a train struck her in December 

Debiltating: She lost her entire right leg, her left leg was severed below the knee and she also risks losing her fingertips after suffering hypothermia as she lay helpless in the plummeting temperatures

Despite the double amputation, her friends and family say she is in good spirits and a crowd-funding campaign has so far raised more than $30,000 towards her medical bills.

Miss Stott had planned to visit a friend following her shift at the Irish Embassy Pub and Grill in downtown Montreal on Monday December 8.

She got a taxi to her house but when she realized no one was at home, she left on foot and headed home.

As a short cut, she made her way over the CN Rail Tracks near Victoria Bridge, an area which has become popular with people crossing despite being unauthorized.

Miss Stott noticed there was a stopped train on one side of the tracks, however she did not spot the second coming the other way. It's not known how fast the train was travelling at the time.  

Her mother told CBC that Miss Stott could see her severed legs beside her on the tracks, so tried to crawl towards them.

She then lay on the ground in the cold for three hours before she saw another train approaching, waved it down and got them to help.

Miss Stott was then admitted to Montreal hospital trauma unit and has undergone 15 surgeries since her arrival. 

Her mother Shelley said: 'It’s a miracle that she’s alive. Every day with her is an absolute blessing. She has an extremely strong spirit and will to live. She was left there for three, four hours with her legs severed, in the cold. She was still conscious. She was hypothermic.'

Her mother said Miss Stott saw her severed legs laying on the tracks next to her so she tried to crawl towards them. She lay in the freezing cold for three hours before she was taken to hospital 

Positive: Despite the double amputation, her friends and family however say she is in good spirits and a crowd-funding campaign has so far raised more than $30,000 towards her medical bills

Despite the severity of her injuries her mother added that she still had a sense of humor.

Mrs Stott added: 'I walked into the room one day and she was awake, and she lifted her leg and said, "Look Mom, I have no legs!" And I said, "Yes sweetheart, you’re going to get a brand new one.'" 

'She said, 'Yes I am! It’ll be firm forever — and I want it tanned,'"

Her mother now plans to take her back to the family home in Ottawa so she can care for her. 

With a long road ahead of her, a GoFundMe page has been set up and has already attracted hundreds of anonymous bids. 

'It’s very overwhelming,' Mrs Stott added. 'I always believed people have a good heart, but for the amount that was raised in such little time. 

'I’m speechless. I’m overwhelmed. I’m full of gratitude.'

Spirit: Her family say she has maintained her sense of humor while laying in her hospital bed. As her mother walked into the room one day she said: 'Look Mom, I have no legs!'
