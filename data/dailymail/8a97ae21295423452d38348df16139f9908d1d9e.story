The victim of a vicious motorbike gang attack was seen today for the first time since he was brutally assaulted.

Married father Alexian Lien left his Wall Street apartment on Friday in a hoodie, baseball cap and sunglasses. He was accompanied by a woman believed to be his mother or mother-in-law.

He shielded himself from cameras as he hurried down the street in downtown Manhattan and entered a high-rise building.

Hidden: Alexian Lien emerged on Friday from his New York home, the first time he has been seen since he was attacked by a gang of bikers

Terror: Mr Lien was gragged from his car and beaten by bikers on September 29 in front of his wife and two-year-old daughter on a New York highway

The emergence of the victim came as four more bikers accused of taking part in the September 29 assault appeared in court.

Bikers Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright, as well as Officer Woljciech Braszczok made court appearances on Friday.

Chance was in court on Friday morning and was the second indicted following Robert Sims.

On Thursday, Sims who can allegedly be seen on video dragging the driver from the SUV and beating him , was indicted.

Investigators continue to work to find out what roles other members of the gang may have played in the attack on a New York highway.

Braszczok also appeared on Friday but covered his face with a hoodie on his way in and out of court. He is next scheduled to appear in February after he testifies before a grand jury.

Caldwell was similarly not indicted and will appear before a grand jury next week.

Suspect James Kuehne appeared in court on Thursday, as the one who allegedly hit Mr Lien repeatedly with his helmet. He has pleaded not guilty.

During the chaotic incident, Alexian Lien ran over biker Edwin Mieses in his SUV. The biker was left with spinal injuries and may be paralyzed.

Lien said he feared for the safety of his wife and two-year-old daughter who were in the Range Rover. He has not been charged with any crime.

Admission: Matthew Rodriguez, 28, is assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and only admitted being part of the ride a few days ago, according to a report

The developments came as another NYPD officer reportedly came forward and admitted to being part of the biker gang, it was revealed on Thursday.Â 

Matthew Rodriguez, 28, who is
assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), only admitted being part
of the ride a few days ago, according to a DNAinfo report.

It is unclear whether the five-year veteran played any part in the violence against SUV driver Alexian Lien.

Rodriguez is part of the division which is currently investigating those involved in the attack.

Detective Braszczok, 32, is charged with gang 
assault in the first-degree, assault in the first degree and criminal 
mischief in the third degree over his alleged role in the incident.

His lawyer insisted he would be exonerated by the very video prosecutors claim incriminates him during the September 29 attack.

'The allegation is that he struck the rear portion hatchback window, which has a gaping hole already in it; it's already destroyed,' attorney John Arlia said. 'Under the law, it's a fatal flaw. You can't break what's already broken.'

Mr Arlia said the video clearly shows Braszczok did not participate in the eventual attack on the SUV driver and was nowhere near him.

Braszczok hasn't been charged with assaulting the driver, Alexian Lien, who authorities say was pulled from his Range Rover and beaten on the street by other motorcyclists.

Hiding: Braszczok, pictured leaving court yesterday, has been undercover for five years, two years with Occupy, and the police and his lawyer say his life is in jeopardy if his face is revealed
