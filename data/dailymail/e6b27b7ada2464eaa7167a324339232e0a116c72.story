Australian Leanne Rowe woke up following a car crash speaking with a French accent

A Tasmanian bus driver has started speaking with a strong French accent after suffering a serious head injury in a car crash.

Leanne Rowe is one of just 62 people in the world and only the second in Australia to be diagnosed with the incredibly rare condition known as 'foreign accent syndrome'.

Ms Rowe first started speaking in what sounds like a French accent when she woke up in Melbourne's Austin Hospital with a broken back and jaw after being involved in a serious car accident.

She told ABC: 'Slowly, as my jaw started to heal, they said that I was slurring my words because I was on very powerful tablets.'

But eight years on, and despite her 
injuries having apparently healed, the condition still hasn't faded and 
her French accent is as strong as ever.

Ms
 Rowe, who was a member of the Army Reserves before the crash, says she 
is slowly coming to terms with the rare condition but revealed it has 
left her feeling anxious and depressed at times.

She told the TV station: 'It makes me so angry because I am Australian. I am not French, I do not have anything against the French people.'

Ms Rowe's daughter Kate Mundy now does the majority of speaking for her mother in public.

She said: 'It has affected her life greatly. 
People see the funny side of it, and think its really interesting, I 
mean, it is interesting but I've seen the impacts on mum's life.'

Her family doctor Robert Newton believes Ms Rowe suffers from the extremely rare Foreign Accent Syndrome - and admits he's never seen anything like it.

He said: 'She turned up after having a nasty head injury eight years ago speaking with a French accent - I couldn't believe my ears. She'd done French at school but she'd never been to France, didn't have any French friends at all.'

Ms Rowe is one of just 62 people to be diagnosed with the condition in the last 70 years.

Psychologist Karen Croot, from the University of Sydney,Â  is one of just a few people in the world to have researched Foreign Accent Syndrome.

She says the condition is caused when tissue in the area of the brain which controls speech is damaged. And while it may sound like Ms Rowe is speaking with a French accent, is is actually just an accident that her speech sounds similar to the language.

She said: 'It's just an accident of chance that happens to that person that what happens to their speech happens to overlap with the features of a known accent'.
