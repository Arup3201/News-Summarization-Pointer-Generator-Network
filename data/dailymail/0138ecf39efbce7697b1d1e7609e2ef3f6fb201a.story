When a 19th century village railway closed in 1965, time stood still.

Station master Peter Short couldn’t bear to leave, so he and his wife preserved all the original features and turned it into a museum.

They raised their four children in the station master’s house and lived there until they died.

Time capsule: Norham Station was closed during the Beeching Cuts in 1965 and is now up for sale

At a stand still: The old 'sleeper' station near the Scottish Border does not look much different to how it was in the 19th century where milk churns would arrive every morning to supply the town's shops

Now their children are selling Grade 
II-listed Norham Station in Northumberland and its three acres of land 
for £420,000. The Shorts’ daughter, Amanda Yule, 47, said her father was
loath to leave so he rented it for five years after it closed, before 
buying it for £800 in 1970.

The family kept their free-to-enter museum open till 2010.

Mrs
Yule said: ‘My dad loved the romance of the railway and my mum’s dad 
was a steam train driver, so the railway was in our blood.

‘We’d
love a railway enthusiast to buy the station and keep it just as it 
is.’ Built in 1851, the station still has its original signal box, 
ticket office, waiting room and platform and its buildings are full of 
railway memorabilia – right down to the enamelled advertising hoardings 
for Gold Flake cigarettes and the platform’s Victorian gas lamps.

It
served its community for decades, taking deliveries of milk churns and 
food on the platform and allowing villagers to travel the length of the 
small branch line, but was abandoned by British Rail when Dr 
Beeching's axe fell in 1965, leaving it to the care of its station 
master who purchased it for just £800.

Mr Short, who also acted as signalman, 
bought the station and all its buildings - including the engine shed and
goods warehouse - and chose not to change a thing.

Richard Landale, of Sale & Partners, who is handling the sale of the station and its three acres of land, said: 'In parts Norham appears to still be a working station, so much has been preserved.

'It is a testimony to the quality of the original building, as well as the love and care of Mr and Mrs Short, who bought the station when it closed, and restored it.'

Tracks: The platforms on either side of the station still remain with the benches and lights in tact

Tracks: The station stood on a 23-mile stretch of track which served the border town of Coldstream and the a number of communities in rural Northumberland

The original signal box still remains on the site, but has not been used for around 60 years

Controls: The signal box still contains the old levers which would transfer locomotives across the tracks and guide them into the small station

Waiting: This photo from the station's early years shows men, women and children ready to board an approaching train

Single or return? Owners could use the Station Masters office where nothing has moved since its closure, every detail from tickets, lost property forms and the Station Master's glass still remain

Untouched: A ticket which has been left on the desk since 1965 shows a journey from Marylebone Station in London and a pair of glasses and a pipe used by the ticket inspector

Office: Papers lay strewn around the old station master's desk while a jacket remains hanging in the window

Attachment: The last station master, Peter Short, did not want to his old workplace go to waste, so bought the site in 1970 for just £800, he has since passed away

Authority: The station master would have gone through his daily routine wearing this hat, which has become slightly frayed since the station's closure

Ewan Harris, a partner at the firm, added: 'This is a unique and rare opportunity to purchase a perfectly preserved railway station.

'Stations do come up for sale from time to time, but never with as much property or land attached, nor as well preserved.

'Not only is this a home, it is also a piece of history, and it is unlikely there is another station similar in the whole country.'

Norham
Station was built in 1851 and stands on the North East Railway Line 
that ran from Tweedmouth in England, across the border to Sprouston 
Junction, Kelso, in Scotland.

Brought
about by the Newcastle & Berwick Railway Act of 1845, the 23-mile 
track served the border town of Coldstream and the rural communities all
along the route. Its one claim to fame arrived in 1948 when the East 
Coast Main Line was flooded and for three months, through the autumn, 
express trains were diverted along the branch, including The Flying 
Scotsman.

The Shorts, who 
showed visitors around the free-to-enter museum they ran until its 
closure in 2010, described it as 'a lovely, happy little station' where 
milk churns arrived each morning, goods were delivered for local shops 
and parcels for the villagers.

Hut: A shovel lies against the wall of the porter's cabin, which has not been used in almost 50 years

Delivery: Old receipts detailing where parcels and post would be send remain stamped and in their pigeon holes

Controversial: Richard Beeching holding one of the reports which would lead to the closure of thousands of railway stations across the country in the 1960s

When British railways reached their peak at the end of the First World War, they faced increasing competition from the road networks and car manufacturers who were selling more affordable vehicles.

Therefore Dr Richard Beeching was brought in to restructure the rail network in order to save money.

The two reports, published in 1963 and 1965, identified 2,363 stations — one-third of those in the network — and around 6,000 miles of track to be closed.

The publications set out in stark terms how nearly half of the nation’s 7,000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic, while one-third of the entire track carried just one per cent of the traffic.

Two-thirds of the rolling stock was not used all the year round.

One extreme example of this under-use highlighted by Beeching was in Norfolk, where the line between Thetford and Swaffham carried an  average of only nine passengers on five trains a day.

Not surprisingly, his proposal sparked outrage from commuters, local councils and the trade unions, who were appalled at the talk of 70,000 job losses.

Route: The discarded tickets was from a passenger who took a journey from South Shilbottle Colliery to Norham Station

Toys: A large model railway was built inside the booking office to make the property perfect for any train enthusiast

Decor: Milk churns, a trailer and a collection of posters from the 1960's adorn the outside of the station building which leads out onto the platform

Danger: A sign next to the station warns passengers against going on the track, but the fine is relatively cheap by today's standards

Family: Sandra (left) and Amanda Short, daughter's of the station's final station master Peter, said they had fond memories of the station growing up

Exterior: The Shorts, standing outside the front of the house, said they would prefer a rail enthusiast to buy the site to keep it as it is

History: This family photo of the Shorts show how it has been a part of their family for decades

Profit: Following the death of their father in 2008, they are looking to sell the station for £420,000, which was bought for £800 in 1970
