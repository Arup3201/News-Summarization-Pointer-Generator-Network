It has been alleged the medic put in the hours at different organisations and continued to work excessively

An out-of-hours GP failed to spot potentially fatal pregnancy complications while working back-to-back shifts, a hearing has been told.

Dr Volker Bornmann worked 'dangerously long' 13-hour shifts for 24 days straight, it is alleged.

The German-born medic put in the hours at different organisations and continued to work excessively despite being warned about the risks, it was said.

Dr Bornmann, who is now facing a misconduct hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, was told he needed to take at least 24 hours off every seven days but continued to work excessive hours, the panel was told.

Concerns
were brought to the attention of the Hampshire NHS Primary Care Trust 
in November 2010 after the ABC Locum Agency reported a 'serious clinical
incident' involving a woman who was 38 weeks pregnant.

He was working in the 
south of England between 2006 and 2010 - almost exclusively as an 
out-of-hours GP - for Hampshire PCT, ABC Locums', Solent Locum Services 
and the South West Ambulance Service Trust.

Dr
Bornmann conducted a telephone triage with the patient but failed to 
spot signs of pre-eclampsia, a condition causing high blood pressure in 
pregnant women, or arrange a visit to the patient, it is alleged.

She later contacted her own doctor and was rushed into hospital with the condition.

Dr Bornmann is also accused of failing to provide 'good clinical care' to 11 patients when conducting telephone consultations between 2006 and 2010.

Nigel Grundy, for the General Medical Council, said: 'Whether or not there ought to be any criticism of the out of hours services themselves, the GMC say the doctor clearly has a responsibility as a professional to make sure he was not working excessively and therefore not put patients at risk.

'He didn't think it was excessive as his wife was away and he was sleeping during the days to prepare to do these long nights.

On one occasion during a consultation with a young child complaining of vomiting and no bowel action for two days he is alleged to have not examined the youngster properly (file picture)

'The pattern of problems may or may not have been related to the GP's hours,' said Mr Grundy. 

'Over the next few weeks other concerns were expressed over the doctor's performance and concerns were expressed over the number of hours he was working and whether that had any effect on his clinical performance.' 

Other alleged failings along with the excessive number of hours worked by Dr Bornmann later emerged when Hampshire PCT began to investigate his work. 

On one occasion during a consultation with a young child complaining of vomiting and no bowel action for two days he is alleged to have not examined the boy properly, taken an adequate medical history or arranged for the patient to be admitted to hospital. 

The PCT suspended him in November 2010 and he has not worked in the UK since.

The GMC now allege Dr Bornmann's actions amount to misconduct and deficient professional performance.

If found guilty he could be banned from working in the UK.

The medic, who has returned to Germany, is not attending the hearing and is not represented. 

In correspondence with the GMC he said: 'From my mind the whole investigation was absolutely unfair from the very beginning.'

The allegations have emerged a month after ministers warned the NHS needs to reform the locum system in which doctors are paid up to £2,000 a shift.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
