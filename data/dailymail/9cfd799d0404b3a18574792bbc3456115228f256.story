Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel has hailed the arrival of Dejan Lovren to the club insisting the former Southampton defender's arrival will only bring the best out of him.

The Reds have splashed out over £80million on several key additions this summer, many of which were needed following the departure of star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million.

And Skrtel has expressed his delight at the strength in depth the Reds defence will have this season, with Lovren only adding to the competition for places.

Quality: Skrtel has proved to be a prized asset for Liverpool over the last few years

He told www.liverpoolfc.com: 'Dejan Lovren had a great season with Southampton and I am really happy that he is with us,' he told his official website.

'We all need competition because that is what keeps you motivated.

'He will make us stronger, so I really welcome his arrival - and it will only make me work harder.

 'Liverpool is not only about 11 players. We will have many games this season, so every player will be important.'

The Reds finished just two points behind champions Manchester City last season but after encouraging pre-season form Brendan Rodgers' side will have renewed hope they can challenge at the top again this time around.

Liverpool entertain Lovren's old side Southampton in their Premier League opener on Sunday as they look to get their season off to the best possible start.
