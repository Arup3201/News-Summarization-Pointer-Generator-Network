Jordan Henderson and Diego Costa were involved in a furious tunnel bust-up after Liverpool's clash with Chelsea on Tuesday night. 

The pair had to be separated by a member of Liverpool's backroom staff as they squared up following Tuesday's Capital One Cup first leg at Anfield.

The argument started on the pitch, with Costa niggling Henderson all game, as the pair squared up but no punches were thrown.

Both players later squared up and shouted at each other once more  during a furious argument in the tunnel after the final whistle.

Henderson, who released Raheem Sterling for his equaliser in the 1-1 draw, clashed with Costa towards the end of the game, although what sparked their post-match confrontation is unclear.

Costa seemed annoyed at Henderson after the Liverpool midfielder appeared to tangle with Cesc Fabregas and push him over. 

Henderson stood his ground and referee Martin Atkinson stepped in to speak to both players at the time.

Costa, meanwhile, also clashed with Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel, who elbowed the Chelsea striker in the build-up to Sterling's goal. Costa was also accused of standing on the foot of a Liverpool player. 

Chelsea took the lead at Anfield courtesy of an Eden Hazard penalty following Emre Can's foul on the Belgian in the area before Sterling struck to level the tie. 

Brendan Rodgers' side travel to Stamford Bridge next Tuesday with a place in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley to play for. 

The bust-up between Henderson and Costa adds extra spice to Tuesday's second leg and deepens the rivalry between the two clubs.
