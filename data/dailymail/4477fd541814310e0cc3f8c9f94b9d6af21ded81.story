Foreign Office minister: Mark Simmonds is the MP for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire

Foreign Office minister Mark Simmonds quit yesterday, saying his salary and expenses of almost £120,000 were not enough to enable his children to live with him in London.

The MP for Boston and Skegness in Lincolnshire resigned with an attack on Parliamentary expenses - complaining that his income would not cover the cost of a Westminster flat that would accommodate his family.

This is despite the fact that he received a ministerial salary of £89,435, an allowance of around £28,000 to rent a property in London and pays his wife Lizibeth up to £25,000 in her role as his office manager.

Mr Simmonds said he will also leave Parliament at next year’s election because he hardly ever sees his family – two daughters aged 15 and 13 and a son aged 12 – because they live in his constituency.

‘There needs to be a system of allowances and support structures in place that supports MPs in their work, enables them to be normal people, which currently I believe is not the case,’ he said.

‘That’s the main reason I have resigned. The sacrifice to family life has become intolerable and the support for continuance of family life is not there... It is time we had a mature debate about this.

‘When I became an MP, the situation and support mechanisms were very different. You were able to have a family home in the constituency and a family home in London. That is no longer the case.’

Mr Simmonds, who says he stays in a hotel while in London, said he was not suggesting a return to the former expenses regime, which was widely abused, but believed that the pendulum had swung too far ‘the other way’ since the expenses scandal.

Six months after becoming an MP, Mr Simmonds was said to have bought a four-bedroom terraced house (below, centre) in Putney, south-west London, for £650,000.

Its mortgage interest was paid by taxpayers from 2001 and 2009, with the MP claiming more than £2,000 a month to cover the cost, reported the Daily Telegraph.

Following the expenses scandal in 2009, a rule change meant Mr Simmonds could only now claim for renting in London - instead of claiming for the mortgage interest on his Putney home.

Property records show he sold the house soon after for £1,187,500 in December 2010, which represented a rise of more than £500,000 on what he had paid almost a decade ago.

An estate agents' description from 2010 which can still be viewed on property website Zoopla described the house as a ‘spacious and well-presented terraced family home’.

The value of the house is now £1,742,500 - a further increase of more than £500,000.

Asked if his expenses claims were in order under the old system, Mr Simmonds said: ‘I was one of those who was not involved at all.’

He claimed there were other MPs in a 
similar position to him who were ‘reluctant’ to talk because they feared
 being attacked as ‘greedy’. 

He
 told Radio 4’s PM programme: ‘The previous expenses system was clearly 
indefensible, abused and people rightly went to prison for fraudulent 
behaviour.’

He said the reason for his departure was ‘a lifestyle choice’, adding: ‘It became intolerable – I rarely see my children.’

Criticising
 the Parliamentary expenses regime, he said: ‘The allowances do not 
stretch to renting a flat near Westminster large enough for my children,
 so I stay in a hotel. I hate it.’

Mr Simmonds yesterday received the support of Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries, who said on Twitter that ‘only the wealthy’ can afford to have their family in Westminster.

But Andy Silvester, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said it was ‘ridiculous’ to say that almost £30,000 was not enough to find a decent family home in London.

‘The expenses system is more than generous, and hearing an MP complaining about it will do nothing to restore voters’ trust in their Westminster representatives,’ he said.

‘It’s no wonder so many people feel some politicians are out of touch.’

Mr Simmonds said he told Mr Cameron he wanted to go at the time of the reshuffle last month, but waited to announce it so he could tell his local association first.

He denied there was any link with Baroness Warsi’s decision to quit as a Foreign Office minister last week in a disagreement over Gaza policy, but his resignation has increased the sense of disarray at the heart of government as the Iraq crisis deepens.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which oversees MPs’ expenses, said it was ‘awake to the impact on family life’ for MPs who have to live in two locations.

‘That is exactly why we provide more support to MPs with family or caring responsibilities,’ it said.

Downing Street named Tory MP James Duddridge as the new minister for Africa.
