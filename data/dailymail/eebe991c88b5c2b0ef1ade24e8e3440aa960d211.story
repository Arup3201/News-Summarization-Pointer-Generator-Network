Their wealthy and mysterious lifestyle has long been a source of intrigue for locals.

Many wondered how Julian Ponder, 43, and Rachel Dougall, 38, were able to afford the £1,000-a-week rent on their palatial villa, given that they seldom seemed to work.

The British couple even became known as the ‘King and Queen’ of Bali because of their aloof behaviour and extravagant use of household staff.

'King and Queen' of Bali: Julian Ponder and Rachel Dougall became known for their aloof behaviour and extravagant use of household staff

And yesterday, as the former antiques restorers spent yet another day in police cells accused of masterminding an international drug-smuggling syndicate, locals claimed they had long suspected foul play.

One villager said: ‘Some of us wondered how they were able to live so well without seeming to be doing any work. A few of my friends mentioned the word drugs but there was never any evidence of it.’

Another said the couple, who moved to Bali from Brighton four years ago, never revealed details of their secretive business to their household staff.

The pair would spend days behind the walls of their villa with a swimming pool – set among rice paddies in Tabanan, a district in the south of the holiday isle.

‘To us they gave the impression of being like a king and queen in their castle and we were just poor people that they might give a reluctant smile to,’ a villager said.

‘We often wondered who they were, what they did, because they hardly went out.’

The couple were arrested this week 
together with fellow Briton Paul Beales after alleged drugs smuggler 
Lindsay Sandiford led police to them.

The 55-year-old housewife, a former legal secretary from Redcar in Cleveland, agreed to the sting operation after being caught allegedly carrying cocaine worth £1.6million into Bali on a flight from Bangkok on May 19.

All four suspects could face death by firing squad if they are convicted.

A team of 20 police and customs officers put Mrs Sandiford under surveillance as she was allowed to attend meetings at hotels and villas across Bali with the alleged buyers.

The team stormed in moments after Mrs Sandiford allegedly passed drugs to Mr Ponder.

Police
 claim to have found drugs hidden in cigarette packets at Mr Ponder’s 
luxury villa. Mr Ponder yesterday claimed he thought Mrs Sandiford was 
bringing a present for his daughter’s sixth birthday.

‘Julian Ponder believes 100 per cent that he was trapped by Lindsay,’ his lawyer told ITV News. He reportedly said he thought the gift-wrapped packages, bearing the words 'Enjoy Sweet Candy' were sweets for his little daughter.

He said: 'I was the subject of entrapment by Lindsay, who knew my daughter was going to be six shortly after her arrival.

'Having been caught she aided the police surveillance and brought the cocaine to me wrapped as if it was a present for my daughter. I never touched the drugs.'

The
 police have 60 days to hand over their files to prosecutors. Meanwhile 
the suspects will be forced to stay in their crowded communal cells.

Miss Dougall yesterday begged police to let her hug her daughter Kitty one last time before the child is flown back to the UK.

Last night Miss Dougall’s father Barry, 64, cast doubt on Mr Ponder’s previous business dealings in the UK.

Public records state that he ran an antiques restoration business called Pen Productions Ltd for ten years until 2008.

However Mr Dougall, of Haywards Heath, 
West Sussex, said: ‘I have been in antiques in Brighton for over 40 
years and I have never heard the name Julian Ponder.

'I know everyone in the restoration trade and I have been on the phone asking round but no one has ever heard of him.

‘We
 are talking about someone who was clearly running a successful business
 and had a nice flat but I can find no trace of Pen Productions’ 
existence.

‘Nobody in my 
circle knows him and if he had been doing it all that time I would at 
least recognise his face. I imagine I would have bumped into Rachel a 
lot more as well.’

Meanwhile,
 Mr Beales protested his innocence yesterday. Speaking from behind the 
bars of the tiny cell he shares with seven other men in Denpasar, he 
said: ‘This is a nightmare. I’m not involved with drugs. I don’t know 
what I’m doing here. I’m scared, of course I am.

'My
 wife can bring in food but she’s only allowed in twice a week. I have a
 flat bit of cardboard to sit on and we have one mattress that we 
share.’

Fair Trials International, a human rights charity, said yesterday that it could provide legal help.

Bruno
 Min, who is a direct assistance manager, said Mrs Sandiford had been 
paraded before the cameras as if she was already guilty.

He
 added: ‘It makes it difficult for us to assume there would be a 
presumption of innocence, in which case it would be impossible in most 
circumstances to get a fair trial.’

Paraded: Three Britons and an Indian national were seen dressed in ill-fitting orange outfits and flip-flops after their arrests

Arrests: Sandiford was detained at Denpasar Airport on the paradise island of Bali, Indonesia
