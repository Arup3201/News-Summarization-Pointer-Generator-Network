We could soon be able to design cells or entire organisms using computer software and 3D printers, a scientist has claimed.

The cells could be used to create biofuels, combat global warming, develop new healthcare and medicines and even recreate alien lifeforms on earth, if alien DNA is ever found.

J.Craig Venter - who helped map the 
human genome and created the world's first synthetic life form in 2010 -
 details the theory in his new book Life at the Speed of Light: From the
 Double Helix to the Dawn of Digital Life.

J.Craig Venter - who created the world's first synthetic life form in 2010 - believes we could soon be designing cells and organisms using computer software and 3D printers. The cells could be used to create biofuels, combat global warming, develop new medicines and even recreate alien lifeforms

'The day is not far off when we will 
be able to send a robotically controlled genome sequencing unit to other
 planets to read the DNA sequence of any alien microbe life that may be 
there,' claimed Venter.

'If we can beam them back to Earth we should be able to 
reconstruct their genomes. The synthetic version of a Martian genome 
could then be used to recreate Martian life on Earth.'

This could even be reversed, and if 
aliens pick up digital transmissions of human DNA they could recreate 
humans on their planet.

Talking to The Sunday Times, Venter claims the synthetic cells could be designed using specifically designed software.

the J. Craig Venter Institute, which conducts research into synthetic 
biology.Â 

He is seeking to patent the first 
lifeform created by humans, dubbed Mycoplasma 
laboratorium.

In 2000, Venter and Francis Collins from the National Institutes of Health and U.S. Public Genome Project claimed they had mapped the entire human genome.

A DNA molecule - shaped similar to a spiral staircase or ladder - is made up of chemicals that link together and form the rungs of this ladder shape.

The sides of the ladder are made of sugar and phosphate.

Human bodies have around 3 billion base pairs, but only 4 per cent of those pairs are said to influence how genes react and behave.

The finished sequence was completed, with 99.99 per cent accuracy in 2003.

In May 2010, Venter was part of a team that became the first to successfully create 'synthetic life.'

They did this by adding a long DNA 
molecule containing a bacterium genome into another cell.

The team analysed the 
genome of a microbe and reconstructed it from laboratory 
chemicals before inserting the finished DNA into a bacterial 
cell, which began to grow and reproduce.

Scientists would then be able to manipulate and modify the DNA by adding certain features to create tailor-made microbes.

These advances in genome technology will form part of a 'genetic revolution', according to Venter, and 'could give humanity crops resistant to 
drought and disease and artificial animals that could yield both food 
and drugs.'

The cells could also be used to increase intelligence, or even extend human life.

By designing the cells on a computer, they would become digitised, making it possible to send the sequencing around the world over the web.
