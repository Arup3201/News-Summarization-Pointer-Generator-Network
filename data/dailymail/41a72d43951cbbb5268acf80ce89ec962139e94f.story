Yohan Cabaye won the award last year at Newcastle just months before moving to PSG, and Cattermole is the 32nd winner of the title.

Former England Under 21 star Cattermole played 24 Premier League games for Sunderland last term, scoring once.

The award ceremony will be held at the Ramside Hall Hotel on Sunday November 30.
