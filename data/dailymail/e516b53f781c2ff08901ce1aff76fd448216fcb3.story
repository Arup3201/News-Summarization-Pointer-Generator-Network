Four teenagers were arrested today during a dramatic raid by a moped gang on a luxury watch shop in London's West End.

Undercover officers were lying in wait as two pillion passengers jumped off their bikes and allegedly started smashing in to Parmigiani in Mount Street, Mayfair using hammers.

One teen was arrested at the scene and three others were detained after allegedly running off down side alleys, police revealed, and it was claimed one of the youths was 'carrying a knife'.

Four teenagers were arrested after a failed attempt to smash into Parmigiani in Mayfair

During the incident, a taxi collided with one of the mopeds - though it is not yet clear how or why this happened.

The attempted raid unfolded this morning and comes after a series of recent 'smash and grab' robberies in the West End, including two at London's five-star Dorchester hotel within a month.

Police were ready to pounce today after they went undercover.

Now a Scotland Yard detective has warned that smash and grab raids are 'in fashion' in the West End with luxury boutiques seen as easy targets for violent gangs.

Speaking at the scene this afternoon, DCI Paul Johnson said the arrests of the 16, 17 and two 18-year-olds, were part of a 'fast-moving intelligence-led operation'. They are all being questioned at London police stations.

It came as part of a Met crackdown on smash and grab raids, dubbed Operation Morgold.

DCI Johnson said:Â 'These 
raids are in fashion and we are going to take them out of fashion, we 
are going to show people that they are going to get put before the court
 and suitably punished if they carry out these crimes.

'Cash in transit robberies have fallen 30 per cent year on year over the past four years and are continuing downwards.

'We
 have worked with the cash in transit industry to improve security and 
safety and as a result it is now harder for criminals to get away with 
them.

'As a result they are turning to the expensive shops in the West End.'

No items were stolen this afternoon and none of the staff inside were injured, he said.

Police descended on the scene and taped off the jewellery shop after the alleged raid on Wednesday morning

The incident was being investigated as part of the Met's Operation Morgold probing the recent rise in smash and grabs

But the detective could not say if the boutique's staff or management were aware the police were expecting trouble on the street.

He
 said: 'Our intelligence led us to expect a robbery on this street, 
there are a lot of high-end stores in the area so any one could have 
been the target.'

'We
 will not comment on how many officers we had on the scene beforehand, 
although they included surveillance specialists and officers from the 
Flying Squad.'

Commenting
 on considerations for the public's safety he said: 'We were not armed 
today. Smash and grab raids tend to involve hammers but generally they 
are not armed.

'If we had intelligence to suggest they were, we would have prepared for that.

'We undertake a full risk assessment before any operation and no one was hurt today.'
