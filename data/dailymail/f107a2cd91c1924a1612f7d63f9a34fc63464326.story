Workers are burrowing through 700 feet of rock and dirt to stop New York City's drinking water from seeping into the ground before it gets to the city.

Once they dig down below the Hudson River, crews will build a 2.5-mile bypass tunnel to replace a section of the Delaware Aqueduct that has been leaking up to 35million gallons of water each day for decades.

The $1.5billion project, which takes place about 75 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, will enable the longest continuous tunnel in the world to continue providing about half of the metropolis's water.

Problem with the plumbing: Crews in Wappinger, New York, are working on a project to fix a section of the Delaware Aqueduct that provides New York City with about half its drinking water

Can you dig it? Workers are digging 700 feet below the ground to repair and replace parts of the tunnel, which was made in the 1940s 

Underground leak: Two shafts are being built on opposite sides of the Hudson River in Wappinger and Newburgh, New York on either side of the tunnel's major problem

Upriver: The major problem in the Delaware Aqueduct is below the Hudson River between Wappinger and Newburgh, two towns roughly 75 miles north of Manhattan

Crews are blasting through hundreds of feet of shale and building a shaft on each side of the Hudson River to reach the 85-mile World War II-era tunnel.

The work illustrates the ingenious complexity of delivering 1.1billion gallons of water for 9 million people and the intricate efforts to keep water flowing smoothly as the sprawling network of tunnels ages

The Delaware Aqueduct will have to be temporarily drained for repairs in 2022 during the end stage of the project.

A portion of the  price tag is devoted to making sure other water sources continue to flow smoothly during the shut-off, the first time since the late 1950s.

The tunnel was constructed between 1939 and 1944 and runs as deep as 1,500 below ground at some points, according to CENews. 

'The goal of the city in constructing the waterworks was to construct something comparable to the great works of Rome, to last through the ages,' said Paul Rush, deputy commissioner of New York City's Department of Environmental Protection. 

'It's with that spirit and with that purpose that this work here continues the tradition.'

More than a trickle: Parts of the Delaware Aqueduct north of New York City leak as many as 35million gallons of water every day

Long way down: The aqueduct, which was built during the World War II-era, goes as low as 1,500 below ground at some points 

The Delaware Aqueduct carries 500 million gallons of water a day from four reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains in southeastern New York state to a distributing reservoir at the city's doorstep.

The tunnel, wide enough to drive a car through, is one of two major arteries that carry unfiltered water from bucolic countryside areas of the Catskill and Delaware watersheds.

The aqueduct, a marvel of engineering relies solely on pressure and gravity but is aging. 

The Department of Environmental Protection has known of leaks since the the 1990s and has monitored the tunnel with a camera-equipped Automatic Underwater Vehicle, or submarine drone.

The area where the aqueduct goes through limestone are lined with steel, and cracks have formed when the tunnel transitions back to reinforced concrete.

The waterway is so leaky in one stretch through rural Wawarsing that New York City is buying dozens of homes above it that were plagued with repeatedly flooded basements and squishy lawns. 

Residents often spend money pumps and other repairs to combat the damage and the DEP has given millions to help the 

The leaks are far worse where the tunnel travels under the Hudson by Newburgh, but homes are not affected.

Between 15 million and 35 million gallons of water seep through cracks each day, enough to quench a small city.

The bypass will permanently replace the leakiest portion of the tunnel. The other cracked stretch will be repaired using grout. 

Working around the problem: Crews will build a 2.5-mile bypass tunnel to replace parts of the Delaware Aqueduct with the worst flooding

Pavement problems: Cracks have formed in the tunnel where the steel lining in limestone areas turns back into reinforced concrete

Load of rubble: Piles of blasted shale rock need to be scooped up and taken to the surface in the repetitive process needed to reach hundreds of feet below ground

Before workers begin digging the bypass tunnel next year, they first need to complete the entry shafts on opposite sides of the Hudson River at Newburgh and Wappinger.

Since late 2013, workers have been drilling into the shale, scooping up the blasted rocks with a crane and then repeating the process. The result is a deep, 30-foot diameter shaft in Wappinger.

Workers in hard hats guide giant buckets of rock from the dark, drizzly bottom to the disc of daylight high above.

'It's a very repetitive process,' said George Schmitt, a project manager.

The massive project, scheduled to finish in 2023, is just one big-ticket item needed to keep water flowing smoothly through the massive system. 

A filtration plant in the Bronx expected to handle up to 30 per cent of the city's needs will cost $3.5 billion, and $4.7 billion has been spent to build a third water tunnel beneath the city.

Long wait: The bypass tunnel and other parts of the project are scheduled to be completed in 2023 after the temporary shutdown of the Delaware Aqueduct 

The work that will repair, rather than replace, the other leaky stretch is especially tricky because the aqueduct carrying half the city's water will have to be shut down for six months starting in 2022.

The shutdowns means four of the city's major reservoirs will be out of service temporarily. 

Keeping the water flowing while patching up a main artery can be as tricky as repairing an airplane in flight. But Mr Rush said the city will rely on alternate water sources and conservation.

The roughly century-old Catskill Aqueduct, which is 74 miles long, will be scrubbed and updated to increase its flow in time for the shutdown of its companion aqueduct, and the city will rely on water from Croton and wells in Queens. 

On the conservation side, the New York City plans to update bathroom fixtures in its public schools and has started a voucher program for up to 800,000 water-saving toilets for qualified houses and apartments. 

If all goes as planned, New Yorkers turning their faucets will never notice.

'It will happen seamlessly in the city,' Mr Rush said. 'They will continue to get their water.'

A billion gallons a day: Numerous measures to keep New York City's water flowing, including a filtration plant in the Bronx, are being taken in advance of the aqueduct's shutdown
