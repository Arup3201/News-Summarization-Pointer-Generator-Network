Nicola Adams has come out fighting over Frank Warren’s recent claim that boxing ‘is not a sport for women’.

‘I absolutely love boxing,’ said the 32-year-old, who became the face of her sport after winning Olympic gold for Britain in London two years ago. ‘I think Frank is in the minority view.

‘I’ve competed for my country and won gold medals, so regardless of whether he likes women’s boxing I’m doing the sport and I’m doing it well.

‘Not everybody is going to like everything. I don’t like sprouts whereas my brother loves them. It’s just one of those things.

‘Britain showed me at the Olympics how much they loved women’s boxing. ’

A shoulder injury has forced Adams (above) to miss the women’s World Championships, which start today in Jeju, South Korea.

Savannah Marshall, a 23-year-old 6ft middleweight from Hartlepool, known as the silent assassin, is tipped to become the first British woman to win consecutive world titles.

‘She’s actually not so silent,’ said Adams. ‘She’s as bubbly as me when she opens up.

‘Because I’m older she still comes to me for advice and I tell her she’s got all the talent, she just needs to tell herself she can beat anyone in the world.’
