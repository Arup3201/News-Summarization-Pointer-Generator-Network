The mother of the British surgeon found dead in his prison cell in Damascus claims that members of the Syrian government have been taunting her about his death and cruelly stated ‘we gave you a gift… your son’s dead body’.

Mrs Fatima Khan said the Syrian regime have been admitting to her privately that they had him killed – but denying it in public.

Dr Abbas Khan, from London, had travelled to Syria to help treat casualties from the war but was found dead after being held for over a year.

Mrs Khan told MailOnline that when she visited Damascus last year in a bid to find out how he died, a member of the Syrian government issued an astonishing provocation.

Bouthayna Shabaan, a spokesperson for the regime delegation in the Geneva peace talks and President Bashar Assad’s personal representative, said: ‘Yes, we killed your son. Go back to Britain and tell your British government we killed him.’

She claims that Ms Shabaan has admitted the Syrian regime killed Dr Khan to her personally ‘many times’.

A harrowing admission of guilt also allegedly came from Jawdat Ali, who works for the Syrian foreign minister deputy, Faisal Makdad.

She claimed that he said Dr Khan was killed 'because his upbringing was wrong’ and then asked: ‘Why teach your son to be a humanitarian aid worker?’

According to Mrs Khan, various reasons have been given for her son's death, with another official during her visit to Damascus saying that he was killed ‘for being a terrorist’.

‘If he was a terrorist I would have killed him myself,’ said a highly emotional Mrs Khan.

On Thursday she claims to have had a text message from an immigration officer in Syria that said ‘it was an honour to kill your son’.

Dr Khan, an orthopaedic surgeon from Streatham, South London, had travelled to Aleppo to lend his expertise in treating those wounded in the war.

However, he was arrested by the Syrians in November 2012, held for 13 months and tortured in a series of notorious prisons.

Dr Khan was on the verge of being released when his family were told of his death by what the Syrian government calls suicide and they say was political murder

The regime agreed to free him, but he was found hanging in his cell only four days before his release.

Syrian officials claim the 32-year-old father-of-two hanged himself.

But Mrs Khan said: ‘They poisoned his food then hanged him. They’re proud that they killed him. Killing doctors and humanitarian works is so easy for Assad’s regime. They shouldn’t be in power.

‘I don't feel like living anymore.’

David Cameron sent her a letter of condolence and the British government has been broadly supportive, but Mrs Khan isn’t relying on its help to get to the bottom of her son’s death.

She has travelled to the Geneva peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition and confronted Assad’s delegates.

On Wednesday she had to be led away by security staff after shouting at them.

‘For God's sake, why did you kill my son?,’ Fatima Khan yelled as the team walked out of their hotel.

‘He was a humanitarian worker, he wasn't a fighter. Don't you have a heart?’

Many of the delegates, she said, seem to be very uncomfortable in her presence.

She said: ‘They can’t look me in the eye and have been trying to avoid me.’

Regime delegate Luna Shebl has been accused of trying to stop Mrs Khan from speaking to the press

However, Luna Shebl, a member of the regime delegation, a source at Geneva said, has been deliberately aggravating and obstructing Mrs Khan.

Ms Shebl has attempted to stop Mrs Khan speaking to the press, while journalists from Syrian state TV station SANA loyal to her have shouted insults.

They apparently taunted her with cries of ‘your son was a killer’.

Dr Khan’s family, meanwhile, believe that his body has been flushed with fluids to cover up evidence of anaesthetics in his bloodstream.

Although the results of a British post-mortem examination are not yet ready, a CT scan of Dr Khan’s body has apparently shown a cut in the femoral artery in one of his thighs, suggesting fluids were injected into his body.

And his family told The Mail on Sunday the Syrian authorities embalmed the 32-year-old’sDr Khan's body against their wishes before returning it to them.

Dr Khan’s brother, Dr Shahnawaz Khan, 29, said he fears the embalming was a deliberate attempt by the regime to ruin any future post-mortem examinations as the process involves flushing a dead body with fluids to preserve it.
