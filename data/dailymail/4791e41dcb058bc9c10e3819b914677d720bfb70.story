A 27-year-old delusional former soldier with PTSD was in police custody Tuesday afternoon after shooting himself during a police standoff in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Authorities say David Eugene Smith called area police to tell them that he was the man on the news accused of killing three people in Lakeland, Florida--including his own sister--and fleeing.

According to Knox County Chief Deputy Sheriff Eddie Biggs, Smith said he wanted to die at the hands of law enforcement.

SWAT members surrounded the Knox County motel where Smith was staying on Tuesday. At some point Smith fired shots, including one at himself.

He was wounded and taken into custody, though the extent of his injuries were unknown.

Biggs says the SWAT officers did not fire.

According to WFTS, the suspect was living in the Lakeland crime scene where the bodies of Danyala 'Diamond' Smith, 31, Ni'kosi Williams, 25, and Miranda Mims, 28 were discovered Monday evening by one of the victims' 14-year-old daughter.

On Facebook, Diamond Smith listed her spouse as fellow victim Miranda Mims.

A frantic manhunt had been underway forÂ  Smith as police feared the armed and mentally ill man could strike again in the worst way.

'We hope and pray that we don't have a rampage,' said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd.

Police were
 first tipped off to the grisly scene left behind at the Florida 
residence by the 14-year-old daughter of one of the victims.

The girl returned home Monday night after having been away for the weekend at an ROTC event.

She then found her mother dead and her commander reported the shocking crime to authorities, police say.

Police say Smith is delusional and has a previous record for drug and weapon offenses as well as a mental hygiene arrest.

He reportedly posted to Facebook the message 'my adulterous wife, you know better' despite not actually being married.

'We fear for the community': Smith has a history of PTSD and mental illness and police called him 'exceptionally dangerous' but say he was 'compliant' while being hauled away. He'd been living with two of the victims for months prior to the slaying

'We've got to locate this fellow because he is absolutely dangerous,' said Sheriff Judd at a news conference.

Smith was believed to be driving a beige 2002 Mercury Sable with Florida tags 708MDB.

He is described as being of Native American descent and has black hair and dark eyes.

Police originally believed he may have been headed toward family in Texas or to Chattanooga, Tennessee where he knows a former classmate.
