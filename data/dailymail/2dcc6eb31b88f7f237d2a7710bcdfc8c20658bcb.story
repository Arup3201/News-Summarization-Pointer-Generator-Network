England captain Steven Gerrard expressed his relief that England’s players had emerged unscathed and criticised 'poor' refereeing following a stormy affair against a cynical Honduras.

The Central Americans – who held England to a goalless draw in Miami on Saturday night – had four players booked and Brayan Beckeles sent off following a stray arm on Leighton Baines which earned him a second yellow card.

The match was delayed for 30 minutes during the first half because of an electrical storm, but that did not dampen the enthusiasm of the Hondurans who were guilty of a string of dangerous challenges.

Unhappy: England captain Steven Gerrard criticised the refereeing after England's draw with Honduras

Daniel Sturridge was on the receiving end of a kick to his chest from Emilio Izaguirre, a misdemeanour which earned the Celtic defender a booking from referee Ricardo Salazar.

And skipper Gerrard was critical of both Salazar and the Honduras players after the game.

‘We’re quite frustrated in the dressing-room,’ he told ITV. ‘We thought the refereeing was poor. I think we’re a bit relieved that we’ve come out of there with no injuries.

‘They were making some horrific tackles for a friendly a week before the World Cup. I certainly got caught with a bad one. I don’t understand referees when a player kicks the ball into a player’s chest, it’s a clear red card in the first half and the game could have been different.’

And goalkeeper Joe Hart added: ‘The Honduras team were hell-bent on breaking it up, legally or illegally.

‘Stevie caught a bad one, Sturridge got smashed in the chest and Bainsey nearly had his head taken off and the lad got sent off.’

Gerrard, however, feels England must improve heading into the World Cup.

‘If you look at the chances we maybe had the better chances,’ he said, ‘but we need to learn to play better in these conditions because the opposition is going to improve.’

England manager Roy Hodgson, meanwhile., tried to be more diplomatic and did not talk as openly about the Hondurans' approach.

‘They were quite physical,’ he said.

‘It was a real stop-start game, one of the most frustrating I've been involved in for a long time. We had a long stoppage, I thought we dealt with it and in the second half it was attack v defence.

‘They got their men behind the ball and we didn't take our chances. We attemped to make them but this is a game I will soon forget.

‘I will take the draw and that we got away without injuries and that we have experience against Central American opposition.’
