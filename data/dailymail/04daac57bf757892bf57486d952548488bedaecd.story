As any child of the eighties  will tell you, neon is a staple of any after-dark celebration- but two foodies from Melbourne have taken their love of it one step further to create a sweet treat that lights up the night.

Steve Felice and Glenn Storey, the pair behind nitrogen ice-cream pop-up 196 Below, have designed glow-in-the-dark neon ice cream in a first for colour-lovers around the nation.

The fancy fluoro treat is the brain child of Steve, a Melbourne-based patissier, who told Daily Mail Australia that his life has always 'revolved around neon'.

'I used to be a dance party child in the 1990's and early 2000's and I used to make party clothes out of neon material,' Steve said.

'I was in a cake decorating shop and saw UV-reactive food colouring, and thought "wow, that would be really cool. I wonder if I can actually pull this off",' he said.  

Steve, who started 196 Below 18 months ago with his business partner Glenn, said that he had been looking to do something really different and jumped at the chance.

196 Below specialises in nitrogen ice cream, a method which cools the dairy delicacy down quickly for a creamier texture and fresher flavour, Steve said this was a way to have a bit of fun. 

'We do a lot of different events and festivals, and love playing around with the theme of wherever we are serving, so I thought I would experiment and see if it could be done,' Steve said. 

The gourmet ice-cream business is participating in White Night on Saturday evening in Melbourne, a festival that runs for one night each year from sun set to sun rise.

The three brand new fluoro flavours are Redskin, pine-lime, and mango passionfruit

The pop-up ice-creamery will boast six UV floodlights at it's stall so that customers can see their sweet treat glow in the dark as it is being made

In keeping with the theme, the pair decided to launch three fluoro flavours- Redskin, pine-lime, and mango passionfruit. 

The UV-reactive liquid colouring is completely safe to consume, and have been certified by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia.

'Last Monday I bought some and tried few drops and it worked. I did a jig around the kitchen and wanted to unveil it immediately but I had to wait,' Steve said.

When 196 Below announced the neon ice cream on their Facebook page, the reaction was overwhelming.

'We did a big unveiling, and it's been crazy. A lot of people have been commenting how cool and different it is,' Steve said.

'As we're churning it out people will be able to see it glowing. We also want people to have fun outside of the store and take pictures with their ice cream,' Steve said.

'We're more about taste than anything, but tonight it's about having fun and enjoying the night.'

196 Below will use over 500 litres of liquid nitrogen to make their ice-cream on Saturday night, and is hoping to make a lot of colour-loving customers happy.

The organisers of White Night are expecting up to 800,000 people to attend, as the Melbourne CBD is overrun with revellers.

Along with White Night, music festival Soundwave is also running, as well as celebrations for Chinese New Year and sport-loving cricket fans in town for the International Cricket Cup.

196 Below ice-cream costs $8.50 for a cone or cup, and popular flavours include salted caramel (created with hand-made caramel) and chocolate brownie.

The ice-cream is made with only five ingredients, is vegan friendly and dairy free, and is made without preservatives.  

'This is something completely new, so it's going to be an interesting 12 hours,' said Steve.

'On a good night we serve between 700 and 800 people, but considering the feedback we've been getting it could be even more.'
