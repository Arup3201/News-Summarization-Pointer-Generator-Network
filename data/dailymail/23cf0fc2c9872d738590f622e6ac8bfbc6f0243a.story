As the inimitable Duckface in Four Weddings And A ­Funeral, she was 
memorably dumped at the altar by Hugh Grant.

'When I die my obituary will probably be 
"Duckface dies",' admits the actress in a short film she's made with M&S in which she models one of its latest collections. However, her new role in season five of Downton Abbey might soon shake up the public's perception.

We shall have to wait until September to find out if Lady Anstruther captures our imaginations in the same way as her breakthrough role in Four Weddings.

Clearly keen to tap into her very British appeal, M&S has snapped the actress in the quintessential seaside town, Hastings, for its Style & Living section.

Actress turned fashionista: Anna Chancellor, who shot to fame as Duckface in Four Weddings, is modelling M&S' latest range. Top, from £6.99, Jacket, £49.50

Anna, 
49, is the perfect poster girl for M&S' range of cosy knits, polka-dot blouses and tailored blazers.

Clearly throwing herself into her latest venture, the actress can be seen frolicking on a British beach and even jumps into the sea in the new imagery.

Down-to-earth she might be, but Anna comes from illustrious stock: she's the granddaughter of the 4th Baron Hylton, her uncle is one-time Spectator editor Andrew Chancellor and her 
­sister ­Katherine was formerly ­married to acerbic writer Wilf Self.

Speaking about her well-connected family, she said: 'I am related to a prime minister, Herbert Asquith and Jane Austen was my great aunt, though going back eight generations. My parents came from quite an aristocratic background. But how that has affected me? It’s difficult to say.

'You are what you are aren’t you? Genetically I suppose it has given me certain qualities but then it’s difficult to know which qualities came from whom, because of course by this stage it’s just stories - they weren’t anybody I actually knew.

'Jane Austen, I’m obviously very proud to be related to her. She was a famously good aunt, didn’t have any children herself but was very keen on her nephews and nieces so if I’m feeling a bit stressed or feeling that things aren’t going very well, I’m like "Are you looking out for me, I hope you are looking out for me."

'Otherwise, maybe I was a bit rebellious about my background. Maybe I’ve embraced it on some levels - and probably a lot my acting skills and my ability with language is inherited.

'My father is very articulate and funny and probably would have made a good actor – there are quite a few hidden theatrical people in my family who weren’t actually actors but probably would have been quite good!'

Speaking about her family - her parents divorced and married other partners, so she has step-siblings - she said: 'It was chaotic, we were outdoors a lot and rode a lot - very privileged but I think it was difficult at times because we were quite wild, that’s for sure. We were quite crazy.

Anna went to a convent school and says she was one of those people who found learning 'very difficult.'

'I think I had learning difficulties actually, in fact, a lot of actors do find that they’re not that academic or intellectual. I often play parts where you would have had to have a very good education, a lawyer, doctor things like that - but I never could have been that in my own life. I could hardly get an o level. I was basically thick,' she said.

She adds that she was 'incredibly lucky' to have found acting; otherwise she could have felt that she was an underachiever. 'I feel I should be able to tell people 
that it is possible, to earn a living doing something you love - it’s a 
great privilege and if you have that you should be very grateful.'

Reminiscing on starting out as an actress at the age of 18, she explains how she 'fell into' becoming a naked artist’s model to earn a bit of money.

'I wasn’t physically shy,' she said. 'I’d turn up and they’d say "will you take your clothes off" and I’d think it was fine. I guess coming from the country side I was never self-conscious. So that was how I earned a living when I should have been at school!'.

Anna had a baby, Poppy,  who was the somewhat unexpected result of a
 romance the actress had at drama school with cult poet Jock Scott at the age of 21. She admits that everything looked like it was going to go 'tits up' and 'disastrously wrong' at the time.

She said: 'I think one of the hardest things about 
having a child is who is going to look after them when you’re working. 
And I was lucky because my mum would take her. But when you’re acting 
you get up very early, you could leave for work at 5am and if you’re a 
single mum, which I was at times, not always, you would have to think 
who would take Poppy and maybe drop her off somewhere the night before.

'So it wasn’t easy for Poppy or me, she didn’t have know 
that mum would pick her up all time - but I was very lucky because I was
 very unsuccessful and very unemployed, so actually, I was around a lot!'

Anna, who describes her personal style as 'scruffy', can't speak highly enough about her best friend and daughter Poppy.

She said: 
'I feel that it was one of life’s incredible coincidences that I 
happened to have a child that I love. Of course I love my child, but we 
just really click.

'I always 
found her so funny, witty, even when she was young she would say things 
and I’d think that’s actually really funny - you’re a genuine wit. She’s
 a wonderful person and we have so much in common.

'So of course you can 
love your child very much but find you don’t have anything in common - 
for either of you, but we can go to galleries and do things together - 
go for walks, we love animals - we’ve got a lot in common and that’s 
just a coincidence I think.'

She also says she has been 'incredibly lucky' to have shared 16 years of her life with her husband, Algerian-born former minicab driver Redha Debbah, who is seven years her junior.

'I was mad about him,' she reminisces. 'It’s very sweet actually, very 
romantic and we’ve been together a long time. We love each other.

'We lead quite separate lives, he’s busy and I’m busy - we come and go.

Despite her enduring success, Anna is modest and doesn't believe that she has all the qualities of a leading lady.

'They always seem to think I’m more the dominatrix, the stalker, the nutter or the evil,' she said.

'I was always a character actress, I suppose. I think it’s a bit more fun – although sometimes it’s quite narrow the view that they see the heroine as.'

Her most defining role has to be alongside Hugh Grant in Four Weddings, of which she laughs: 'When
 I was in four weddings I didn’t realise that Duckface was my name - I 
thought it was Henrietta so it took me ages to accept that Duckface was 
my actual, official name. When I die my obituary will probably be 
"Duckface dies".

'What can I say about that – do I mind? No.'

Revealing her secrets to looking good at almost fifty, Anna says she tries to swim every day and that she's so bored of the gym.

'I hate being told I have to do 50 of this and 20 of that, by then I’m literally praying. I become a Catholic and revert to my roots, praying to the Virgin Mary for it to end. I can’t take any more of it. I just can’t do exercise in that form, but swimming is different.

'And when I come out I can’t be bothered to get dressed so I put on my dressing gown and get in my car, or sometimes I walk back home in my towelling dressing gown and I think everyone will see Duckface and think I’m a nutter,' she said.
