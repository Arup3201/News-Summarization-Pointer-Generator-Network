Around 400 soldiers who were among the last British troops to leave Afghanistan have been presented with campaign medals by the Countess of Wessex.

Sophie, looking smart and chic in a navy coat and purple hat, presented the servicemen and women of 5th Battalion, The Rifles with the accolades to mark their safe return from Helmand Province during Operation Herrick 20.

The Countess, 49, who is the Royal Colonel of the battalion, flew to Alanbrooke Barracks in Paderborn, Germany, to meet the troops.

Several hundred of the soldiers' families braved the cold, alongside local civic dignitaries, to watch the battalion parade behind The Band of the Scots Guards.

After presenting the medals, the Countess addressed the soldiers, praising them for their work in Afghanistan.

She said: 'It is two and half years since my last medals parade and I had the opportunity to formally congratulate my battalion for a very successful tour of duty in Afghanistan. 

'Then the campaign was still in full flow and we did not know when and if we would be called upon to go out there again.

'I now stand here today to congratulate you once more. 

This time however, in the knowledge that your job is done and the battle has been handed over to the Afghan National Army.'

She continued: 'Naturally, the end of the campaign causes us to reflect and we will never forget those that made the ultimate sacrifice or those whose lives have been changed forever by injury and of course we continue to support the families who have been left to carry on.

'With this in mind, it is worth reminding ourselves that your actions have constructively affected the lives of countless Afghans, allowing children the chance of an education and opportunities for work, as well as freedom of movement around the country for so many - all things to be proud of.

'I hope that during this last tour you saw for yourselves first-hand the many positive changes that have been affected by the efforts of our troops since you were last there.'

The Countess added: 'To all of you on parade today, on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen, thank you for your commitment, your drive and your professionalism.

'I am honoured to be here to recognise your efforts, your dedication to your battalion, your regiment, your country and your Queen.'

She then met with several of the soldiers' families and spent time talking to their partners and their children.

Speaking after the medals parade, Stefanie Potter, 28, whose husband Russell is a serjeant in the battalion, spoke of her pride in meeting the Countess.

'I was really looking forward to meeting the Countess of Wessex,' Mrs Potter, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire said.

'She was just asking how we were and how we enjoyed Germany and she asked the children about missing school.'

Speaking to the men, she said: 'I am honoured to be here to recognise your efforts, your dedication to your battalion, your regiment, your country and your Queen'

Mrs Potter added: 'The parade was good and I know they have been working hard to get it right.

'I will miss Germany but it will be quite nice to be closer to family.'

Her husband, who has been in the Army for nearly 12 years, said the next few years would see a lot of change for the battalion as it moves to Wiltshire as part of Army 2020 reforms.

Serjeant Potter, 27, who is also from Worksop said: 'I think there is a bit of disappointment that we are moving from Germany because it is such a fantastic place to live, especially for the new recruits who maybe haven't been abroad before. 

'But Salisbury Plain is an excellent place. Being in the UK means we will be able to see our families more but at the same time I joined the Army to go and see the world.

'We will miss Paderborn a lot, especially the culture of Germany, the festivals and the Christmas markets.

'We also have friends here and connections and we will return.'
