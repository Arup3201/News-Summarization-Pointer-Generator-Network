He prides himself on staying abreast of voters' concerns, but Ed Miliband appears to have taken this policy a little too far during a meeting with a group of female students.

This is the unfortunate moment the grinning Labour leader was caught posing with the three young women - making
a hand gesture more commonly associated with cheeky builders.

Mr Miliband was campaigning in 
the village of Thrapston, Northamptonshire, following the shock resignation of
Tory MP Louise Mensch.

Staying abreast: Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured striking this strange pose during a meeting with three female students in Northamptonshire

He was meeting voters on Thursday ahead of the by-election for the Corby and East Northamptonshire seat with prospective parliamentary candidate Andy Sawford.

But when the students jumped out of their car to greet the Labour leader, he couldn’t resist a chance to engage with them.

While he chatted with the two blondes and a brunette, Miliband was snapped caught making the awkward 'boob jiggling' gesture.

One onlooker said: 'These students pulled their car over shouting 'it’s Ed Miliband, it’s Ed Miliband.’

'They jumped out of the car and were having a bit of banter with him - one of the girls had broke her arm on holiday and Miliband was asking about that.

'They posed up for a picture but he pulled this odd kind of boob jiggling gesture just before the photo was taken.

'I’m pretty sure he wasn’t being lecherous, it was just an inadvertent hand movement.

'But it was a really unfortunate time to make such a gesture when there were three pretty students standing next to him.

'I’m sure he meant nothing by it - but he’ll be absolutely mortified when he sees it.'

The Corby by-election has been described as Labour’s most significant electoral challenge since he became leader.

The party needs to overturn a Conservative majority of just under 2,000 to win.

Speaking at the rally, Mr Miliband, said: 'We will be working hard during this campaign.'
