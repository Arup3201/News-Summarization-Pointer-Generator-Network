A teenager who suffered serious brain damage when he was knocked off his bicycle by a van has taken his first steps since the accident.

Ryan Smith, 17, was left in a coma after he decided not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his hair. 

He remained in hospital for almost a year following the accident on July 22, 2013, near the seaside village of Chapel Saint Leonards, Lincolnshire.

Ryan Smith, 17, has taken his first steps since suffering severe brain damage almost a year ago. He is pictured in the hydrotherapy pool where first walked with his father, Mark

Mr Smith, Ryan's father, said: 'There is a very long way to go but to be
 told at the time that he would not survive - to him standing and walking 
on his own - is incredible. It was a beautiful moment'

At the time, Ryan’s father, Mark, released a heart-breaking image of him cradling his son as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets.

The family were told by doctors that Ryan would probably not survive and even if he did, he would be severely disabled.

But in November last year they were overjoyed when Ryan spoke for the first time after he came out of a four-month coma.

And in April, the family reached another milestone when he defied doctors to stand unaided at the Children’s Trust Tadworth rehabilitation unit in Surrey.

Today, Mr Smith, 44, told how his son had incredibly taken his first steps unaided in a special hydrotherapy pool on Sunday, just in time for Father Day.

He said: ‘We are just so amazed.

‘There is a very long way to go but to be told at the time that he would not survive, to him standing and walking on his own, is incredible.

‘It was a beautiful moment and bizarrely it happened by complete accident really.

‘He was in the pool with two supportive floats which then slipped out from under him.

‘But rather than letting himself sink, he placed his feet on the ground and took a couple of steps.

‘So we thought we’d try and see how far he could get - and amazingly he walked the entire width of the swimming pool.

‘We were told even if he survived he would not be able to do anything for himself. But now he is talking, eating and drinking all by himself.

‘He still has problems with his short-term memory but can hold conversations with people now. The steps he is taking are superb, but it is a slow and long process.

‘Ryan has had a fantastic amount of love and support around him and I cannot stress enough how integral that is for the recovery of people who have suffered brain injuries.’

The Smith family are now campaigning for a law to force cyclists to wear helmets.

Olympic champion and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins has also backed calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads.

Former Welsh international footballer John Hartson, 38, who beat testicular cancer in 2009, visited Ryan on his birthday on March 31.

Since seeing Ryan’s story, Mr Hartson has taken Ryan on as his ‘adopted son’ according to Mr Smith, and even changed his Twitter picture to the pair of them together.

Mr Smith, a paramedic, added: ‘John Hartson has been magnificent with Ryan and we would all like to say a huge thank you to him.

‘He has been tweeting and supporting online, he has literally taken on Ryan as his “adopted son” it has been great.

‘By him doing all of this for us, which he didn’t have to, he wanted to, it widens our appeal and it is just brilliant.’
