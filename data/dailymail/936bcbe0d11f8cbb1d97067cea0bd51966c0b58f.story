Mugshot: Martin Bass was arrested on Tuesday  after officers found his child in a car outside a casino

A father has been arrested after he allegedly left his one-year-old child behind the wheel of a running car so that he could go into a casino and gamble.

Martin Bass was arrested  on Tuesday in Tunica, Mississippi and taken to the Tunica County jail after officers found his child in a car outside Bally's casino.

A sign in the casino's car park warns gamblers not to leave a child in the car or deputies will be called.

It says: 'Children or vulnerable adults must not be left unattended in vehicles. Violations may result in notification to the Department of Human Services and or law enforcement authorities.'

But Tunica County Sheriff's Department  said that officers responded to the casino after the baby had been left in the car alone for almost an hour.

Police found the baby in the driver's seat playing with the steering wheel while the car was running.

Bass now faces child neglect charges.

It was also not immediately clear whether he has an attorney. 

The Department of Human Services was also notified after Bass's arrest.

It's unclear if the child is in protective custody or staying with family. 

Another father, Mike Appel was in Tunica County to try his luck at the casinos but could not believe a father is accused of gambling with his toddler's life.

‘I got two kids, one six months and one four-year-old,’ Appel told WMC Action News 5. 

‘It makes me upset. I would never leave my kids in the car by themselves and go in gambling.’
