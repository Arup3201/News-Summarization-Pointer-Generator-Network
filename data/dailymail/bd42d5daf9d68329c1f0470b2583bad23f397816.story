A 48-year-old man has been arrested for killing a 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome in an early-morning hit-and-run after she wandered from her home, police said.

Michael Elardo, from Syosset, New York, handed himself in to police on Monday, a day after he allegedly fled the scene after plowing down Bryanna Soplin in Levittown.

The teenager was taken to hospital with head and body trauma but died four hours later.

She had been put to bed on Saturday but when her mother went to check on her just after midnight, she was missing.

Family members, who said Bryanna had never wandered from the home before, believe she was walking to visit her grandfather, Carlos Curuchaga, who lives two miles away in Hicksville.

Witnesses said they saw the young girl waiting at the crosswalk until it was her turn to cross.

'They did see that car 
actually pass through the red light and struck her and just kept going 
without stopping,' her distraught mother Jennifer Curuchaga told Newsday.

A police spokeswoman said at least one person witnessed the incident, but it was not yet clear whether the teenager was in the crosswalk when she was hit.

Scene: Witnesses said the girl, who'd left her home to visit her grandfather, had waited for the lights to change so she could cross the street - but Elardo allegedly went through a red light and hit her

The girl's 
mother, who had earlier appealed for the driver to come forward, said 
she wants to know why he left her daughter there to die.

'I
 don't know what my reaction is going to be when I see him, I don't know
 what I am going to say,' she said. 'I don't know why he couldn't have avoided hitting her...

'I 
just want to ask him why he couldn't have just stayed there with her, 
why he left her.'

She said that she now wants him to be brought to justice so others can be saved.

'No matter what happens to him, no matter what the judge decides, it's not going to 
bring my baby back,' she said. 'But, at least it will keep him from doing this to 
other people.'

Missed: Bryanna's family remembered her as a happy young girl who always had a smile on her face

Questions: Bryanna's mother, right, said she wanted to know how the driver could just leave her daughter

The family is now struggling to come to terms with the loss of the happy young girl.

'She was the perfect girl,' Bryanna's grandmother, Patty Curuchaga, said through tears. 'She was a 
beautiful girl. She always smiled. She never complained.'

Elardo is charged with leaving the scene of an accident and he is scheduled for arraignment on Tuesday in First District Court in Hempstead.
