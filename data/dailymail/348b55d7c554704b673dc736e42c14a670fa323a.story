Dave Chisnall’s sensational 7-2 win over World Champion Gary Anderson sent him a point clear at the top of the Betway Premier League table in Exeter on Thursday night.

The 2014 Grand Slam of Darts runner-up continued his unbeaten start to the season as he picked up his fourth win in five matches in front of the 4,500 sell-out crowd at the Westpoint Arena.

Chisnall nailed six 180s and finished seven doubled from 12 attempts as he stormed to victory over Scottish star Anderson to go a point clear of Michael van Gerwen.

Van Gerwen is also unbeaten so far, but had to settle for his second draw in succession as he was held by Peter Wright.

The Dutchman took out an early 120 finish to break and lead 2-1, only for Wright to reply with checkouts of 101 and 158 as he held a slender lead - but van Gerwen finished 145 in the tenth leg before sharing the final two to take a point.

A 7-5 comeback win against James Wade insured Phil Taylor extended his unbeaten run to four matches to go third in the league with seven points.

Wade opened up a 3-0 lead, but Taylor hit top gear to turn the game around as he won five successive legs to take a 6-4 lead against his opponent.

Raymond van Barneveld was stunned by Premier League debutant Kim Huybrechts who claimed his first win in a 7-5 victory over the Dutchman with a stunning 170 checkout in the game’s final leg.

There was also a debut win for Stephen Bunting who defeated Adrian Lewis 7-3 having lost his previous three games in the league.

Bunting lost the opening leg against Lewis, but returned with five wins in a row to put himself into a commanding lead before being pegged back to 5-3.

However, Bunting ensured he was to pick up the points as he landed 180s in the next two.
