Hospital bosses launched an urgent inquiry last night after the medical records of dozens of patients were found ‘blowing around’ in a street.

Personal information on about 49 patients – including names, ages and medical histories – were listed on four so-called ‘ward handover sheets’ found in the middle of Cardiff, more than 40 miles from Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where they originated.

In some cases, nurses had written that patients exhibited signs of cancer, but were ‘not aware’ they might have the disease.

The records of 49 patients from Frenchay Hospital, in Bristol, were found blowing around in a street in central Cardiff, more than 40 miles from where they were supposed to have been kept

The person who found the papers told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They were just blowing around. Anyone could have picked them up.’

North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, last night offered its ‘sincere apologies’ to those involved and promised a ‘full and thorough investigation’.
