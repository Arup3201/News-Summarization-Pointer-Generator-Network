The event in Melbourne will run parallel with the International Champions Cup that takes place in North America, which was one by Manchester United this summer.

Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano said: 'We are looking forward, once again, to being a part of the tournament.

'We are particularly excited to be visiting Melbourne, which is home to our sister Club, Melbourne City FC. We know that it will also be a home away from home for Manchester City and we can’t wait to play in front of our Australian fans.'
