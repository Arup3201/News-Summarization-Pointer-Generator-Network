A 13-month-old baby boy died this morning after swallowing pills from a prescription bottle he was given to play with as a rattle, police said.

Edwin Perocier Jr, of the Bronx, New York, was found unconscious in his crib by his parents at their home around 8am on Friday morning.

His 22-year-old mother, who has not been identified, called 911 and the baby was taken to Lincoln Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Edwinâ€™s parents told police they gave him the bottle to play with then took it away when they saw the lid had come off, reported the New York Post.

The couple said they noticed pills had fallen out of the bottle and were scattered around. The mother then called 911 for an ambulance.

His father - identified by the New York Post as 49-year-old Edwin Perocier - and the mother were being questioned by police on Friday.

A New York police spokesman confirmed to MailOnline on Friday afternoon that neither of his parents had been charged as of 2pm.

One local newspaper had reported the parents were charged with reckless endangerment, but the NYPD spokesman said this was incorrect.

The spokesman identified the baby but said his cause of death will be determined by a medical examiner and a police investigation continues.

The parents live in Longwood, a low-income part of the Bronx, on Southern Boulevard near the intersection with East 156th Street.

A Lincoln Hospital spokesman provided no further details, but the medical examiner's office told MailOnline an autopsy will take place on Saturday.
