Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia is closing in a move to Russian side Zenit St. Petersburg.

Sportsmail understands that an offer has been made this week for the Spanish international and the club are looking to recoup close to the £15.8million that they spent on Garcia in the summer of 2012.

A fee is yet to be agreed between the two sides but it is believed that the initial offer is around the £13m mark, with City holding for a little more from the Russian club.

On the move? Manchester City midfielder Javi Garcia close to moving to Zenit St. Petersburg

On the ball: It is believed Zenit's initial offer for Garcia will be £13million

There is, nonetheless, an expectation that a deal will go through in the coming week and Garcia’s two year spell at the club is set to come to an end.

Garcia was signed by Roberto Mancini from Benfica in 2012 but has struggled to cement a place in the City side and has often looked sluggish and short quality in central midfield.

The signing of Brazilian Fernandinho last year limited opportunities while the addition of Porto midfielder Fernando has added further competition for places in the City midfield.

The player recognises that his future at City is bleak and he is now ready to move on to pastures new.
