A man broke into a young single mother's home and set fire to her bedroom after she rejected his advances in Facebook. 

James Graham, 37, posted a number of comments on Joanie Yount's Facebook photographs before the mother-of-one told him to stop. 

The 22-year-old from Frankfort, Kentucky was not at home when Graham is alleged to have broken into the property on Hillview Drive, Franklin County on November 28.

Graham was arrested on December 12 and appeared before a grand jury who said he should be charged with second degree arson and second degree burglary. 

Ms Yount's house, which she shares with her three-year-old son suffered fire, smoke and water damage by the blaze and is uninhabitable as a result.

Fire investigators believe the fire had started in a box near Ms Yount's bed.  

She has been forced to move in with relatives because of the extensive damage caused by the fire. She has even been forced to take on a second job to help pay for her young son's Christmas.  

The property's floor and ceiling suffered extensive damage. 

Frankfort Police's Major Robert Warfel told WLKV.com: 'This is one of those tragic situations where somebody is now without a home and for such a minor reason. It's disturbing.'

Major Warfel said Graham had made unwanted comments on Ms Yount's Facebook page: 'She rebuffed those and it's kind of what set this all in motion.'

Ms Yount's sister Samantha Beagle said her husband spotted the fire and they tried to get into the property in a bid to save it. However the flames were too intense and there was nothing they could do. 

Mrs Beagle her sister was not interested in any form of relationship, claiming she just wants to be left alone. 

She added: 'It could have got a whole lot worse. And I just wonder, what if she was in there? What he would have done to her if she was lying in her bed before he set the house on fire.'   

Graham, who is 6'6 and weighs 200lbs is being detained in Franklin County Jail and will need a cash bond of $50,000 to secure his release.
