A sham marriage was foiled when a registrar saw the would-be bride holding hands with her real boyfriend.

Svetlana Kokenyova, 20, was to be paid £3,000 for marrying Pakistani student Ali Ansar at the registry office in Llandudno, North Wales.

However, the plan was rumbled when the registrar spotted Kokenyova, from the Czech Republic, hand-in-hand with her real boyfriend Vladimir Bango, 21.

The pair was seen in the registry office car park after she had given notice of the planned marriage.

The three were jailed at Caernarfon Crown Court today.

Prosecutor Wyn Lloyd Jones said the aim was to enable Ansar, a student in this country illegally, to remain in Britain.

They were arrested after the registrar contacted the UK Border Agency, who were waiting for the bride and groom to return to the office.

Kokenyova, living in Salford, was sentenced to 10 months in prison, and her boyfriend Bango, also from the Czech Republic was jailed for one year.

Ansar was sentenced to 14 months after admitting conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law.

Parvez Tabassam, 50, Pervaiz Iqbal, 41, Abip Aslam, 37, who organised the would-be sham marriage were jailed for between 16 months and 21 months after admitting the same offence.

Judge Philip Hughes said: 'Those people like you who involve themselves in this type of criminal activity must be made to understand, if caught, they will be dealt with robustly and immediate prison sentences will follow.'
