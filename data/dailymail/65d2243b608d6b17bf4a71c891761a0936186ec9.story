Sheila Heacock, 44, was arrested yesterday for allegedly having sex with on of her male 16-year-old students

A female high school teacher, 44, from Yucaipa California was arrested Yesterday after sheriffs received a tip from a school administartor that she may be engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with her 16-year-old male student.

The alleged abuse began in January 2014 and the most recent incident occurred in March.

Yucaipa's sheriff Station and detectives from the Crimes Against Children Detail contacted the 16-year-old who told of the sexual relationship between he and his teacher Sheila Heacok at Yucaipa High School.

News Mirror reports that Heacock could face charges of unlawful sexual intercourse, oral copulation with a minor, penetration by foreign object, and unlawful communication with a minor.

The alleged incidents took place at a remote location near the intersection of Butterfly Drive and Wildwood canyon Road about 10 miles from the school, said Cindy Bachman, a spokesperson for the sheriff's department.

The L.A. Times reports that the incidents never occurred on school grounds, at the victims home, nor did they occur at the teacher's home.

Heacock was booked at the Central Detention Center and is being held at $100,000 bail. She will be arraigned this coming Tuesday in San Bernadino Superior Court.

Heacock has been employed as a Spanish teacher at Yucaipa High School for three years

Heacock has been a teacher with the Yucaipa/Calimesa school district for 18 years and worked at Yucaipa high school for three years.

It is unknown whether this is the first sexual relationship the teacher has had with one of her students or with an underage party.

'Thereâ€™s always a possibility when someone has daily contact with minors that there may have been some other unlawful behavior,' Bachman said, 'and in this case, the suspect has been a teacher for 18 years.'

Heacock is currently on paid administrative leave as that is the protocol and the school is cooperating with investigators.

'Of course our very first concern is about the safety and well-being of our children,'said Cali Binks, superintendent of the Yucaipa-Calimesa Joint Unified School District.

'We take these matters very seriously, and our heart goes out to the families of all parties involved.'

The investigation is ongoing and those with information are encouraged to call the Crimes Against Children Detail, Detective Jenner Wood at 909-357-3615
