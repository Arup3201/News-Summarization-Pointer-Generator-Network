Brendan Rodgers was sat in the press room at St James’ Park when he began answering a question about Real Madrid.

By the time he had finished, the subject of his response had kicked off their La Liga match in Granada and were 1-0 up inside 90 seconds thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo.

Rodgers, unwittingly, had spoken of holding no fear ahead of Tuesday’s trip to the Bernabeu.

Had one of the televisions inside the room been relaying Real’s game then he might have revised his response.

The European champions are, at present, in frightening form. In their last six matches they have plundered 24 goals, Barcelona and Liverpool among those vanquished in that period.

Indeed, you must trawl back to May for the last time they failed to score in a league fixture.

Free-scoring, however, Liverpool are not – freefall would be a more apt description of late.

They have drawn blanks in three of their last four, and even then the 2-1 League Cup victory over Swansea arrived courtesy of two goals in the final four minutes.

Rodgers insists that he welcomes the trip to the Spanish capital, ‘They’re all great games, aren’t they?’, was his reply when asked about the prospect of his side taking on Real amid their current struggle.

His tone, however, betrayed his trepidation, for he knows what lies in wait. After all, it was Liverpool just last season who terrified anyone who dared to venture to Anfield Road. That is why they are here in the Champions League.

But that team – inspired by Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge and a carefree Raheem Sterling – does not exist any more, or certainly not right now.

At Newcastle on Saturday during their 1-0 defeat, they were void of energy and invention, a team low on confidence and seemingly with no answers as to how to halt their slide.

Meanwhile, in Spain, Ronaldo was scoring his 22nd goal of the campaign – that is three more than the entire Liverpool squad combined.

It was he who broke the deadlock in quite brilliant fashion at Anfield a fortnight ago when he strode on to James Rodriguez’s exquisite through-chip and hooked into the top corner. Karim Benzema added two more with alarming ease.

At Granada, it was Ronaldo, a Rodriguez double and Benzema on target in a comfortable 4-0 success – the leading men are at the top of their game.

Add to that the return of Gareth Bale and you would perhaps forgive Rodgers for adopting a ‘damage limitation’ approach when the action gets underway.

There is also, of course, the not-so-trivial matter of revenge. It was during the last-16 stage of 2008-09 that Liverpool enjoyed a 5-0 two-legged triumph.

Steven Gerrard smashed a double in the 4-0 rout on home soil, but it was the captain who sounded a note of caution ahead of last month’s 3-0 defeat.

‘We are playing against the best side in Europe and if we have two or three passengers it can become embarrassing against sides like this who are deadly,’ he said.

Gerrard was wise before the event and so it transpired that Real were easy victors.

Liverpool fans have every reason to fear a repeat on Tuesday night.
