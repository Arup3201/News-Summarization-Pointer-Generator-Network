A mother-of-two has transformed herself into a super svelte mum with the help of Facebook.

Kelly Cairns, 34, from Ryhope, Sunderland, had never struggled with her weight until she gave birth to her two sons and suffered from post-natal depression, which caused her weight to balloon to 14st 7lb and a size 18.

Worried what the other school children would say to her sons, Kelly, now a size 12, decided to do something about her weight.

Turning to food as comfort during bouts of post natal depression caused Kelly's weight to reach 14st 7lb 

Kelly has lost over 3st after gaining support through a Facebook group, and intends to lose another 10lb 

She started a Facebook page for recipes, diary entries and photos, and with the support of her followers has lost over three stone - with more to go.

Kelly, who runs a business from home and now weighs 11st 7lb, said: 'I started losing the weight with a slimming club, but when it plateaued I needed something to help me with the last push.

'I started the Yummy Mummy Weight Loss Plan on Facebook in August this year to help me lose the final 10lb before November.

Kelly, pictured as a size 18,  says her bad eating habits continued as her sons grew up, causing her weight to keep rising 

Kelly credits the support she has received and shared online with her continued weight loss success 

'In the first weekend I got over 400 likes on the page - I couldn't believe it.'

Kelly first started piling on the pounds after the birth of her two sons - Rhys, nine, and Evan, seven.

She suffered with post-natal depression and turned to food as a comfort.

Kelly said: 'As the boys got older, I was stuck in bad habits and the weight continued to go on.

'I would worry what the other kids would say to Rhys and Evan at school in the playground.

'The final straw for me was when I saw a picture of myself from the side and I looked huge.

Kelly decided to start the Yummy Mummy Facebook page to document her progress and help her to get over the final hurdle and lose those last few pounds

'I had moved from Wales to Sunderland and didn't really have many friends, so stepping through the doors to the Slimming World group was a huge deal.' 

Breakfast: White toast or cereal 

 Lunch: Sandwich from Greggs

Dinner: Takeaway or something from a jar

Snacks: Biscuits and crisps

Breakfast: Fruit smoothie

Lunch: Leftovers from last night or soup

Dinner: Pasta with homemade sauce or chili

Snacks: Fruit

Kelly lost the majority of her weight thanks to the group, but after leaving she missed the moral support and her weight loss slowed down.

Kelly began losing weight as she feared sons Rhys (l) and Evan (r) would be bullied over her size 

During this time Kelly also started weight training. Although it helped tone her body, she lost motivation as her muscle gain also meant she put on weight.

She decided to start the Yummy Mummy Facebook page to document her progress and help her to get over the final hurdle and lose those last few pounds.

She said: 'Putting pictures online helped me see how far I've come and if I'm having a fat day then the encouragement of others helps keep me going.

'I started putting recipes up to show other mums that eating healthily doesn't have to cost a fortune.

'I never thought it would be this popular, but it's a real confidence boost.

'Now I just need to lose the final 10lbs. I'm hoping to do it by the end of November.'
