A futuristic yacht that is fully customisable and measures 24ft in length has gone on sale.

The Jet Capsule can be used as a luxurious compact yacht, taxi, police vehicle and even a military patrol vehicle, according to its Italian designers.

The compact boat is now on sale for £126,000 for a basic version, while a ‘VIP configuration’ costs £214,000.

The boat was launched at the 2013 Monaco Show by the Naples-based company, Jet Capsule, which is taking orders and expects to deliver the first capsules in four months.

The capsule measures 24’6 feet (7.5 metres) long and 11’5 feet (3.5 metres) wide, which the firm says is ‘more spacious than any other’ boat of the same dimensions thanks to its fully customisable interior.

The company allows clients to customise the compact vessels according to their needs, including the colour of the vehicle, layout and interior design touches

The company allows clients to customise the compact vessels according to their needs, including the colour of the vehicle, layout, interior design touches and engines.

For example, a mini mogul in need of a compact yacht could choose to have a large sofa which transforms into a triple bed.

There is also an option to have a transformable sofa that turns into a double bed, along with a tiny kitchen and private bathroom.

While the company can create luxurious mini yachts, it is also working on adapting its Jet Capsule to other purposes. An ambulance version is pictured

Luxurious additions can be included for an extra cost, such as an adjustable lighting scheme, premium fittings, rear automatic closing doors and a sundeck.

As the vessel can also be used as a taxi, there is the option to choose between six and nine seats, while the company says the capsule can also be turned into a specialist police vehicle, ambulance or even a military boat.

The design of the Jet Capsule has been refined since a team of engineers working in the automotive industry came up with the idea five years ago.

They wanted to build a yacht small enough to minimise high costs for it being kept in a port, but large enough to be able to carry a group of friends in comfort to an island where they can sleep aboard in comfort.

The Jet Capsule is made from 70 per cent carbon using vacuum-infusion moulding and has photochromic windows, which change their transparency in response to light intensity.

The vehicle has between 315 and 740 horsepower depending on the hydro jet propulsion system selected by a would-be owner, with a top speed of 35 knots, or 40mph.

The firm said the carbon body of the vehicle, as well as its carbon fibre deck, allows the craft to be ‘extremely lightweight [while] guaranteeing maximum stiffness, efficiency and minimum waste’.

It said that as less diesel is needed aboard, the yacht is less expensive, more environmentally friendly, but still has a large range because of its efficiency.

Despite the current crisis of the nautical industry in Italy, Jet Capsule is expanding and claims to be the only new nautical company started in Italy in 2012.

The shipyard is located in Naples and employs 30 workers.

The Italian company is keen to adapt its yacht capsule for military purposes. An illustration of what the product might look like is pictured
