Jurgen Klopp has admitted he would be open to offers from Premier League clubs, saying England is the only other country he would consider working in.

The Borussia Dortmund manager has long been linked with a move to England, with Arsenal the most likely option when Arsene Wenger decides to move on.

And now the popular German has hinted that a move to these shores would be an attractive proposition.

Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp has admitted he would be interested in working in England

He told BT Sport's SportsHUB programme: 'I think it's the only country where I should work, next to Germany because it's the only country I know the language a little bit and I need the language for my work.

'If somebody will call me, then we will talk about it.'

Klopp's Dortmund have struggled to replicate the form of previous seasons and currently sit just above the Bundesliga relegation zone by virtue of goal difference only.

They will try and rediscover their winning form when they travel to Paderborn on Saturday afternoon.

Klopp said England was the only other country he would consider working in 

Klopp, 47, has achieved considerable success during his time at the Westfalenstadion, winning back-to-back Bundesliga titles in 2011 and 2012, and guiding them to the Champions League final in 2013.

Before that, he was a legend at Mainz, making 337 league appearances as a player and then managing them for seven years.

But he insists he has never thought about his legacy at either club and prefers to concentrate on the present.

He said: 'Not when I was starting no. I was 18 years at Mainz and I thought, that's it enough. I love this club in Mainz, I love this city, for a long time. My home town and so on.

'When I came here I thought OK now I can work as a normal coach, two or three years - next club, next city. I'm really interested in life, it's not important for me to stay for a long time in the same place.

Marco Reus has been linked with a move away from Dortmund, with Bayern Munich and Chelsea interested

'My children are old enough to stay alone, that's not the problem. I am here for more than six years, I don't know when it will end, I don't think about this.

'But it's not my idea to build a legacy. We will see, as long as it's successful and we can develop everything, we shouldn't change.'

There has been plenty of speculation about the future of Dortmund's star asset, Marco Reus, with Bayern Munich and Chelsea among the interested clubs.

On his future, Klopp said: 'We had very successful years and we couldn't keep all these players. Not all of them stayed here. They had their own dreams their own situations different ideas, whatever. So we will see.

'The most important thing is the story of this club will go on. We'll have to do it with other players.

'It's not our idea to keep this team together until the end, until their 34 and they go away. That was not the idea. We did it because of the potential of these players.'

Mats Hummels, the centre-back, has also been linked with a move away from the Bundesliga side

Watch the interview in full on SportsHUB, BT Sport's news and information show, tomorrow (Saturday 22nd) on BT Sport 1 from 3pm. Klopp also features in the European Football Show on Sunday (BT Sport 1 from 6.30pm), culminating in live coverage of the Milan derby.
