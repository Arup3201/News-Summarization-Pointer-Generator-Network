More than half of local authorities in England currently inform parents if their children are fat (picture posed by model)

Parents should be phoned up and told their child is too fat, according to guidance published by an official health watchdog.

Public Health England suggests school nurses should contact the parents of overweight children and offer them advice on how to help them lose weight through better nutrition and more exercise.

The scheme – derided by critics as ‘intrusive’ – has already been quietly implemented in more than half of local authorities in England.

It comes as another health agency, NICE, says the overweight or obese should be prescribed free Weight Watchers sessions on the NHS.

On Tuesday the quango advised GPs to offer patients the 12-week slimming courses, which cost around £100.

But yesterday an obesity expert said paying for the courses short term would not work because people would simply pile on the pounds as soon as it stopped.

Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘If there was a guaranteed certainty that people would continue to lose weight, then I would be right behind it – but I really do believe they will not.’ 

Yesterday, the Daily Mail reported on how GPs were being advised to offer Weight Watchers classes to obese patients

The latest plan to combat childhood 
obesity is contained in official guidance to schools, local councils and
 the NHS on the controversial national child measurement programme, 
under which children are weighed at school.

The child measurement programme has 
drawn criticism in the past from parents of children as young as four 
who have received letters telling them their child must go on a diet.

British girls are the fattest in Europe – almost a third are overweight or obese, says a study.

Girls under 20 top a league table of 22 nations in Western Europe, with 29.2 per cent being overweight and obese.

Of those 8 per cent of the girls meet the clinical definition of obesity, having a Body Mass Index of 30 or above.

Older British women are also battling the pounds with 57 per cent classified as fat – third highest after Iceland and Malta. Estimates from a global study for 2013 found 66.6 per cent of men in the UK are fat. This places them fifth in the European league table.

An estimated 26 per cent of British boys under 20 are overweight and obese – placing them 10th.

The report from the US-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, published in The Lancet, says there has been an  increase in obese children in developed countries. But the rise in adult obesity has slowed down.

The latest guidance suggests parents whose children are identified as underweight, overweight or obese could receive a ‘follow-up’ phone call, to offer them ‘personalised advice and services to help control their child’s weight’ – such as referral to a slimming club.

The guidance warns the school nurse must use a ‘sensitive, motivational approach’ so that parents do not feel that their parenting skills are being criticised.

Last night, parents’ groups hit back at the guidance – saying it was up to mothers and fathers and not the nanny state to decide what children should eat.

Margaret Morrissey, of pressure group Parents Out Loud, said: ‘Labelling children, contacting parents, being Big Brother doesn’t help. What would be more useful, rather than lecturing, would be removing the temptation of large packets of sweets from supermarket shelves.’ 

Norman Wells, from Family and Youth 
Concern, said: ‘While it is a laudable aim to encourage healthy eating 
and physical exercise from a young age, interventions that parents 
perceive to be undermining their role and interfering with family life 
are unlikely to be effective.’

But the 
advice was backed by the National Obesity Forum which said school nurses
 could provide positive information on nutrition.

Latest
 figures from the classroom weigh-ins show that 9.3 per cent of children
 in reception class (aged four or five) are obese, meaning they are so 
fat their health is in danger. In the final year of primary school (age 
ten or 11), the proportion of obese children has risen to 18.9 per cent.

Dr
 Ann Hoskins, of PHE, said the phone calls were already taking place in 
56 per cent of local authority areas. She added: ‘The National Child 
Measurement Programme is crucial in monitoring the progress of on-going 
work to tackle childhood obesity locally and nationally.’
