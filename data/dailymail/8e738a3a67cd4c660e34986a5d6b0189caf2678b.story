Incentives: Border Patrol officers are receiving special 'bonuses' for arresting suspected illegal immigrants, according to a new report (file picture of a Border Patrol officer)

Getting paid on time each month is usually enough of an incentive for most people to do their jobs properly.

But US Border Patrol agents who arrest 
immigrants on the border with Canada are also getting 'bonuses' of as much as $2,500 a year - on top of their normal pay, according to a new report.

These 'gifts' reportedly include $100 Home Depot gift 
cards, additional holiday time and even cash bonuses.

New York City immigrant advocacy group 
Families for Freedom and the NYU Immigrant Rights Clinic used the 
Freedom of Information Act to reveal the incentives, which it described as 'disturbing.'

Agents in the 'Buffalo sector' of the 
border with Canada, covering counties in New York and Pennsylvania, were
reportedly given around $1 million in cash awards between 2003 and 
2011.

Abraham Paulos of Families for Freedom said 'we have every reason to believe that this is going on everywhere else,' reports the New York Daily News.

The files did not reveal the reasons behind the bonuses but Border Patrol officials testified they were awarded for 'professionalism,' according to the website.

A spokeswoman for the US Border Patrol said in a statement yesterday that the bonuses are not 'paid incentives and 
awards for specific human targets or enforcement actions.'

'No such practice... has ever occurred,' she said.

Vouchers: Bonuses received by officers working at the US border with Canada in New York and Pennsylvania have reportedly included cash and even store vouchers

Concern: A New York immigrants advocacy group which revealed the details using a Freedom of Information request called the payments 'disturbing'

The report found that agency officials had a budget of $3,000 in 2011 just for gift cards, which they gave out as part of a program called "On-the-Spot Award," according to the Daily News.

It also revealed that agents from a single Border Patrol station in Rochester wrongfully arrested hundreds of people between 2006 and 2011 who were actually in the US legally - many of who were from ethnic minority backgrounds.

However, the agency's spokeswoman said it 'does not tolerate racial profiling.'
