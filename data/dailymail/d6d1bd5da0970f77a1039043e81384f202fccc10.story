Is Yaya Toure back? The problem with him is that you never can tell. For every lung-busting drive through the middle of midfield there is a lazy waft of the right boot and shrug of the shoulders. This game, however, hinged on a loitering run and swish into Brad Guzan’s net, serving as a reminder that he still means business.

The 31-year-old was nowhere near his best and is an ever-increasing enigma, but one Manchester City know they must persevere with. The alternative - Fernandinho alongside Fernando - is unimaginative and one-paced.

In keeping with this season thus far the Ivorian flitted in and out at Villa Park. There were flashes - a lovely dinked ball from a standing start to almost present Sergio Aguero with a golden opportunity - but also moments you sat and wondered whether this was really the same player who could have pipped Luis Suarez to the major Premier League gong in May.

The death of his brother Ibrahim earlier this year is bound to have had a lasting impact - it would on anyone. That tragedy can go a long way to suggesting why Toure is in and out, not looking himself. But the overt jostling for a summer move, with a birthday cake as a farcical by-product, means Toure has become an easy target for persistent criticism.

Some of it is undoubtedly unfair. City owe a lot to Toure, who has been a major reason why they have clinched two titles and are mixing it in Europe. But those who question his desire appear to be doing so justifiably. Toure rarely breaks sweat and rarely gets himself into either box. The game can occasionally pass him by.

The one saving grace at Villa Park is that he became more urgent as the clock ticked down. But his persistent dip in form is obviously becoming more than a passing concern for Manuel Pellegrini. But this was vintage. A passenger for the majority and a stroke of genius to clinch it late on.

Toure did the basics well, helping out his back four to good effect, but didn’t seem to be the key to unlock stubborn resistance yet again. That was summed up midway through the second half when - 25 yards from goal - he aimlessly clipped a ball into the box without thought. He then inexplicably over-hit a routine ball for David Silva. The shoulders slumped, the head went down.

In keeping with his curious way, Toure then  drove with purpose at goal and almost passed an effort beyond Guzan to set City on their way.

So where do we stand with him? Nobody quite knows.
