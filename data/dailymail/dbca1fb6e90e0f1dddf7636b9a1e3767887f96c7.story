At least 35 children were hurt when the floor at a church in rural Mississippi collapsed during an evening youth service last night, sending nearly 80 people tumbling 12ft to a gymnasium below.

Emergency crews and parents raced to Freedom Baptist Church in Myrick, where dozens of youths were gathered for an evening of worship when the ground they were stood on suddenly caved in.

None of the injuries appeared life-threatening, although a 16-year-old girl was taken to a hospital in Hattiesburg with a possible head injury.

 Baptist Church and people from the local community at the scene after 
around 80 people were sent tumbling when the floor they were standing on
 collapsed

Another 19 youths were treated for 
lesser injuries at the South Central Regional Medical Centre and soon 
released. Others were treated at the scene.

Witnesses described a range of wounds ranging from cuts and 
scrapes to possible broken bones.

Worried-looking relatives stood by amid the flashing lights of ambulances and emergency vehicles in the aftermath of the collapse at 8.20pm last night.

Myrick is a close-knit rural community in Jones County, north east of the city of Hattiesburg.

injured but resulted in no tragedies

Pastor Tommy Davis told The Chronicle in Laurel that dozens of youths had been listening to a sermon from a student minister when the cave-in occurred.

'In
 the middle of the student service, the floor — which is a second-story 
floor — gave way, causing about 70 students to fall,' he said.

'But
 it's got to be said that no one was seriously injured, no one was 
trapped. God's hand was certainly taking care of the kids who were in 
that building.'

Linda Gavin,
 a spokesman for the South Central Regional Medical Center, said at 
least 19 young people were treated there and all were later released.

She told NBC News
 that a 16-year-old girl was airlifted to Forrest General Hospital in 
Hattiesburg with what was described as a non-life-threatening 
orthopaedic injury.

Myrick, with a possible head injury

A young worshipper described how the collapse came unexpectedly while the service was in full flow.

'As
 [the pastor] was describing how God defines who we are, we heard a huge
 rumble and the floor collapsed and people collapsed with it,' said Tory
 Hodge, 18. She said stunned students were tossed all about.

'But we are all still alive,' she added, with a relieved sigh.

Witnesses said the youngsters attending the service were in the 7th to 12th grades.

Dozens
 of those who tumbled were shaken but had only minor injuries and were 
released at the scene once they were checked out by emergency crews.

Jones County Sheriff Alex Hodge said the drop was about 12 feet in the floor collapse.
