Charged: Martin Joseph MacNeill has been charged with his wife's death five years after her death was concluded as being from natural causes

A Utah doctor whose children have lived in fear since the unexplained death of their mother in their home five years ago has been arrested and charged with her death.

Approximately one month after 56-year-old Martin MacNeill's release from a Texas federal prison on check fraud left his children scared for their lives, he was booked on Friday at the Utah County Jail in the 2007 death of his wife and their mother, Michele MacNeill.

He has been charged with murder and obstruction of justice.

'I knew from the day my mom died that my father killed her,' his daughter Alexis Somers, his third oldest, told the Deseret News.

'No one believed us. She was taken from us and no one cared. Our family has been fighting for this for so long. It is so emotional for us.'

Investigators have long thought MacNeill killed his wife that April she was found in their Pleasant Grove home's bathtub before covering it up — charges the doctor has denied.

'To find out everything has been a lie has been just horrifying,' his 29-year-old daughter said.

Martin MacNeill's attorney, Randy Spencer, said on Friday it doesn't appear the county has any new evidence, and his client will fight the charges.

Happy: Martin and Michele were the perfect couple for years, with their four children and four adopted Ukrainian children

Picture perfect: The daughters of Martin MacNeill strongly believe that he murdered their mother Michele in April of 2007 and have long worked to see him convicted

Drugged: Michele MacNeill underwent cosmetic surgery at her husband's suggestion, allowing him, a doctor, to provide her with numerous drugs prosecutors say he poisoned her with

An autopsy indicated his wife died of natural causes, but a 2010 addendum to that report questioned the manner of death.

Authorities
 now say they believe Michele MacNeill was drugged by her husband. Her 
children say it was to escalate at least two affairs he was having. One 
was with a woman who soon after his wife's death moved into their home, 
posing as the children's nanny. The second, two years before his wife's 
death, told her psychiatrist she was having an affair with a 'serial 
killer.'

Following MacNeill's release in July after serving a three-year sentence for fraud, forgery and identity theft, his daughter said she was terrified of him striking revenge against her and her siblings who had long accused the former clinical director of the Utah State Developmental Center as well as lawyer in her mother's death. 

Michele MacNeill's death on April 11,
 2007 was 
initially ascribed to natural causes, but information supplied by the 
Alexis and her sister Rachel helped the medical examiner to change the 
results to suspicious in
 October 2010.

Fraud: Martin MacNeill (left) and girlfriend Gypsy Willis (right) were convicted for identity theft and imprisoned until his release last month from a Texas federal prison

Daughters: Alexis, left, and Rachel are convinced their father murdered their mother so that he could live a life with his girlfriend Gypsy Willis

'It's really sickening to me,' she told Deseret News
 after his release from prison. 'I am back into this panic feeling, just
 really nervous knowing what he is capable of doing and now he is out.'

The unravelling of the MacNeill family
 began in 2005 when her father started losing weight, tanning and acting
 strangely, even disappearing for days at a time.

Until
 then, the children had had a 'loving and affectionate' Mormon childhood
 with their father, their beautiful 
mother and eight children - four of which were from 
the Ukraine.

But, in 2007, Michele became convinced her husband was 
having an affair after she found out the same number had been called over 
and over again at strange hours of the morning.

The number
 belonged to Gypsy Willis who MacNeill said was renting a property he 
leased out. Though Michele was not convinced, she let the matter rest.

Tragic end: Michele MacNeill was found dead in her family's home's bathtub while recovering from cosmetic surgery her husband allegedly forced on her

Tender: Michele was described as a loving, caring mother who did everything for her children and her husband, even having a facelift for him

Then a few days later, MacNeill came to his 50-year-old wife with a strange request - he wanted her to have a facelift.

Though
 his pretty wife did not want to, she went along with her husband to 
keep him happy. Two weeks later she had the surgery and was back at her 
home recovering with supplied pills of Valium, Percocet, Phenergan and Ambien by her husband.

Though heavily sedated, Michele told her daughter Alexis: 'Your dad kept giving me pills.'

A
 few days later, when she was feeling better after Alexis took control 
of her recovery, she told her daughter: 'In case anything happens to me,
 make sure it wasn't your dad.'

Michele was found dead in the bathtub a few days later - just eight days after the surgery.

MacNeill
 claimed his wife slipped and fell. In a call to 911 he said he could 
not get his wife out of the bath and had to call his neighbour to help 
before he administered CPR. But it was too late.

According to an affidavit filed in 4th 
District Court, Utah State Medical Examiner Todd Grey said the 
combination of medicines found in her body, which may have been forced 
upon her and could have been lethal, Deseret News reports.

Intentions: Authorities now say they believe Michele MacNeill was drugged by her husband, opening the door to an affair he had been having with a woman who just days later moved into their home posing as a nanny

An investigator with the Utah County 
Attorney's Office told People Magazine last year: 'There is probable cause to 
believe that Martin MacNeill had the opportunity, the motive, the 
psychological disposition and...the capability of killing his wife 
Michele MacNeill.'

Until now Martin MacNeill had never been charged in her death.

'This is the first day he's in prison because he killed my mom,' his daughter Alexis Somers told the Deseret News. 'He's not been held accountable for that until now.'

When Alexis found out about her 
mother's death, she said she 'screamed from the top of her lungs' 
because she knew that her dad killed their mother, she told ABC in an interview last year.

The next few years, Rachel said, was a 'nightmare within a nightmare'.

MacNeill hired Willis as a nanny to 
help look after their youngest daughters, but as the older sisters began
 to fight for custody of their sisters, today aged 11, 18 and 19, they unearthed some devastating 
information about their dad.

He falsified his undergraduate 
transcript to help him get into medical school followed by law school 
and he failed to disclose an earlier conviction for check fraud. He had 
also been discharged from the military for schizophrenia.

Crumbled family: The daughters, three of four children she gave birth to, with four others adopted by the couple, say they have turned their back on their father and he was a man they never truly knew

An affidavit from the second woman he allegedly had an affair with also revealed their father's admittance to her that since he was a young boy he had a thirst for murder - attempting to take his mother's own life but thwarted by his sister who contacted emergency personnel and were able to revive her.

He also told her that he had killed his brother in their bathtub, had a burning desire to kill one of his daughters and offered to kill her husband for her if she so wished, the Deseret News reports.

When Rachel and Alexis threatened to 
have Michele's death investigated if they didn't get custody of their 
sisters, MacNeill dropped his children off the next day and never saw 
them again.

But after that he waged a furious campaign of intimidation telling his daughters he would 'destroy them'.

Meanwhile, during the process of adopting one of their Ukrainian sisters, investigators discovered that Gypsy Willis had been using her social security number to hide her own debt heavy history.

In 2009, Willis and MacNeill were both convicted of identity theft and imprisoned. Now Alexis is determined to see him back behind bars.

'His whole life he has gotten away with things by intimidating people and scaring them, and I am not going to be intimidated. For the last five years, I have tried to stand up and show the world what he has done. So no, I am not going to run,' she told Deseret News.
