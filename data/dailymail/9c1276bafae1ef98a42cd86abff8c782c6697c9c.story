Struggle: M&S boss Marc Bolland, pictures with Rosie Huntingdon-Whiteley, will lose his bonus and so will his staff after a fall in profits for the third year running

Marks & Spencer's army of 65,000 store workers have today all been denied a bonus because profits have fallen for the third year in a row.

Chief Executive Marc Bolland has decided that nobody deserved one because the High Street giant's results for the past year were so poor.

He will not have a bonus for the first time since taking over in 2010, having received a cash and shares bonus worth £829,000 last year to take his full package to £2.1million a year.

This is because annual 
profits to the end of March were £623million, down 3.9 per cent from 
£665.2million a year earlier.

He said: 'No bonuses will be paid out to the whole company. There are no bonuses this year'.

The announcement will apply to all 
M&S employees from the boardroom to the shop floor, where staff received on average £250 last year.

Today's poor results means rival Next has overtaken M&S in terms of earnings for the first time, having recently posted full-year profits of £695million.

Experts said today that Bolland's decision to invest millions in new clothing lines modelled by stars like Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and David Gandy have failed to connect with shoppers.

There have also been complaints by customers about a drop in quality but no drop in price.

Mr Bolland said today that after three years of trying to change the business the results showed 'solid progress'.

This is despite general merchandise 
sales - which includes clothing - seeing like-for-like sales fall by 1.4 per cent, although its food sales were up 1.7 per cent.

'We are making solid progress on this journey and are now focused on delivery,' the chief executive said.

However he warned warned that its new website launched earlier this year was taking time to 'settle in', and will have a negative effect on sales figures.

M&S shares were down 10p each to £4.40p when the London Stock Exchange opened this morning.

Falling sales: A series of expensive high profile campaigns featuring stars like Ellie Goulding and Helen Mirren has still not led to a rise in clothing sales

Total annual group sales were £10.3billion, with UK revenues of £9.16billion and international revenues of £1.15billion.

M&S is ramping up global expansion plans and during the year added 22 new stores overseas, focusing on key markets in India and China.

Today's poor results mean M&S' whole management team, from store level to the executive board, will miss out altogether on an annual bonus because Britain’s biggest clothing retailer has not reached the minimum threshold required.

The last time no bonus was awarded was in the financial year of 2008.

Last year the top team at Marks and Spencer received bonuses to the tune of £3million with Bolland pocketing £829,000 in cash and shares.

Bolland has attempted to turn the business around after years of under investment in warehousing and computer systems.
