Sharon Hinton, 56, was horrified to find the metal iron Monopoly piece when she took a bit of coleslaw

A grandmother-of-one was horrified to find a metal Monopoly piece in her Sainsbury's coleslaw.

Sharon Hinton, 56, from Hornchurch in Essex, was tucking into her 'Taste the Difference' pot when she bit down on something hard and was astonished to find the mini iron.

The mother-of-three called the supermarket and was told to throw away the coleslaw, wash out the pot and bring the container and iron back to the store so it could be analysed.

Mrs Hinton opened the coleslaw at the weekend and was finishing it off on Monday with salmon, a scotch egg and a tomato. 

Hasbro, the company which makes the board game, replaced the iron playing piece with a cat following a poll in 2013 and it is no longer produced.

She said: 'I just could not believe it when I saw the iron. They don't even sell Monopoly at the store I bought it in.

'How on earth did it get there? It makes me think that someone took it out of their pocket and just put it in there.

'And if they did are they going through the whole set? It's really worrying. I think it has been done out of spite, I can't understand how it could have been a mistake.'

The retired customer service worker, who is married to Clive, 60, said she emailed Sainsbury's but got no response so then phoned the head office.

She added: 'I feel that no-one is taking me seriously, I have only spoken to someone because I had to chase them up.

'I wasn't really sure what to say when he said wash the pot out and bring it back with the iron, so I agreed, but I'm not doing that at the moment.

'I have also emailed Environmental Health, but I haven't heard anything back yet. I'm going to wait to speak to them before I decide what to do.

She was advised by Sainsbury's to wash out the pot and take it back to the store along with the mini iron (right) but she has so far decided to keep hold of it in fear that the supermarket is trying to get rid of evidence

'It's still wrapped in clingfilm and sat in my fridge at the moment. It feels like they're asking me to get rid of the evidence.

'They said they will analyse it, but what will there be to analyse if there's no coleslaw in it?

'I felt quite sick after biting into it, God knows where it has been, wrapped up in a snotty tissue in someone's pocket? I could have choked or it could have been a young child.' 

Mrs Hinton has a two-year-old granddaughter called Maisie but insists she would not have put the toy in the food as she doesn't even own a Monopoly set.

She said: 'I am sure it came from the coleslaw. There was about two inches at the bottom and I used to a soup spoon so put it onto my plate.

'It definitely came for the coleslaw. I don't even own a Monopoly set, neither does my daughter.

'Maisie wouldn't have been messing around with it, none of us in the family have the game so she would have no way of even having the iron.' 

A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: 'Food safety is our top priority and we take very rare cases such as this extremely seriously. 

'We need the container to identify the exact product and supplier, so that we can conduct a proper investigation. 

'We've asked Sharon to return it to her nearest store so we can look into this properly, and we'll keep her updated.'

The local environmental health department has confirmed it is investigating the incident. 

The cat fended off competition from a robot, diamond ring, helicopter and guitar to become the new token

In 2013 Toy maker Hasbro asked millions of Monopoly fans to vote on which of its eight tokens to get rid off and what it should be replaced by.

The iron, which featured in the game since its creation in 1935, secured just 8 per cent of a vote and was retired.

It's replacement, the cat, came top with 31 per cent of the poll and remained a firm favourite throughout the voting.

It fended off competition from a robot, diamond ring, helicopter and guitar by voters from more than 120 countries.

The online contest to change the tokens was sparked by chatter on Facebook, where Monopoly has more than 10 million fans.

Monopoly's iconic tokens originated when the niece of game creator Charles Darrow suggested using charms from her charm bracelet for tokens.

The eight original tokens were an iron, racecar, Scottie dog, a shoe, thimble, top hat, wheelbarrow and battleship.

Most of the pieces were introduced with the first Parker Brothers iteration of the game in 1935, and the Scottie dog and wheelbarrow were added in the early 1950s. 

The original U.S. version of the game is based on the streets of Atlantic City, N.J., and has sold more than 275 million units worldwide.

To make the game relevant to fans abroad, the names are changed to well-known streets when it is introduced to a new country.
