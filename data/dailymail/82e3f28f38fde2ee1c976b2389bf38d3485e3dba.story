Bored: Lee Price, 30, told officers he was fed up of living in the 'middle of nowhere'

This is the drug addict who was so bored of living in the 'middle of nowhere' that he dialled 999 and begged to be sent to jail.

But officers told 30-year-old Lee Price he had to commit a crime first - so he went out and did just that.

Price left the picturesque market town of Church Stretton in Shropshire, known for its natural beauty, scenic walks and historic rock formations, to go on a shoplifting spree at Waitrose.

Price had told officers he was bored and the quaint town was an 'alien environment' to him.

All his friends lived in this bustling market town of Shrewsbury 13 miles away, where he grew up, and he could no longer cope with rural life. 

Price followed a security guard around the store in his home town - before 'blatantly' bagging £128 worth of goods in a bid to be arrested.

He was jailed for 12 weeks after pleading guilty to one charge of shoplifting at Telford Magistrates' Court.

He is believed to have been sent to HMP Birmingham in Winson Green, situated close to the notorious James Turner Street, dubbed 'Benefits Street' in the popular Channel 4 series.

Dean
 Easthope, defending, said Shrewsbury-born Price had been living at 
Oakbank Motel in Church Stretton after being released from prison for 
another offence.

The previous offence was not disclosed in court and a West Mercia Police spokesman refused to say what it was.

Mr Easthope described Price's situation as a 'sad case' that had emerged from the fact he felt he 'couldn't cope in the community any more'.

'He is a Shrewsbury lad. All his friends and family live in Shrewsbury. Everything he knows is in Shrewsbury,' said Mr Easthope.

Taking action: When Price was told he could not be arrested without committing a crime, he went on a shoplifting spree at Waitrose (pictured) in Pride Hill, Shrewbsury, during which he stole £128 worth of goods

'When he came out of prison he was housed in Stonham, Abbey Foregate, then
 he obtained privately rented accommodation.

'But when his landlady found 
out about his previous convictions, she changed the locks and he was 
immediately homeless.

'The closest he could be 
housed at such short notice was in Church Stretton. He was put into the 
middle of nowhere. He tells me he lives in the hills in a totally alien 
environment.'

Mr Easthope said Price had been 
addicted to drugs for most of his life and had been on a methadone 
script - adding: 'Life had become intolerable for him.'

'He rang up the police and said he wanted to be locked up,' he said. 'The sergeant quite helpfully told him we can’t lock you up unless you’ve committed a crime.

'He can only see a prison cell as being his respite for the next couple of weeks.'

Sara
 Beddow, prosecuting, said Price had told police, 'I got caught on 
purpose. I need to go back to prison', following his arrest.

New home: He has now been sentenced to 12 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to one charge of shoplifting at Telford Magistrates' Court. He is believed to have been sent to HMP Birmingham (pictured)  in Winson Green

Famous: The town has even inspired British authors, including Malcolm Saville, Mary Webb and A. E. Housman

Welcoming town: Despite his 12-week sentence, Price is likely to be released on licence in just six weeks

She added that the drug addict had also breached a conditional discharge for another shoplifting offence in September last year.

But magistrates only handed him a further 12 weeks in jail to run concurrently for 
that offence - meaning the petty criminal is likely to be released on 
licence in just six weeks.

Church Stretton, which has a population of just 4,670, is situated in the South Shropshire hills on the English-Welsh border.

It is renowned across the world for its countryside walks, beautiful views and geology - with some of the oldest rock formations in existence.

Its picturesque surroundings have even inspired several British authors, including Malcolm Saville, Mary Webb and A. E. Housman.
