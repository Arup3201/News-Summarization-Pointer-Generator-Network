The Eurasian beaver, European bison and White-tailed eagle are among the animals that have made a remarkable comeback in Europe over the past 50 years, zoologists said.

A total of 27 mammal and bird species recovered over the past 50 years thanks to legislative measures and conservation efforts, according to the first ever report of its kind.

Scientists from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), BirdLife International and the European Bird Census Council (EBCC) worked with experts from across Europe to gather relevant data about the distribution and abundance of selected species.

The European bison (pictured) became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss. But a large-scale breeding and reintroduction programme has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern Europe

The report, ‘Wildlife Comeback in Europe’, investigates how and why the doomed species bounced back and provides important lessons for the conservation of these and other species.

Of the 18 mammals surveyed, all of them are making a comeback apart from the Iberian Ibex, whose population has declined by 84 per cent since 1965. Now there are just 279 living in the wild.

A total of 19 birds were surveyed, with the biggest increase in population belonging to the barnacle goose. Numbers of the bird have risen 7,650 per cent since 1947 thanks to a decline in hunting and increased protection of the birds' nesting sites.

Professor Jonathan Baillie, ZSL’s director of conservation said: 'It is essential that we both celebrate and learn from major successes in conservation. 

'This study helps us understand the interventions and conditions necessary for a broad range of species to experience similar recoveries.'

Among the species to reverse their fortunes, is the White-tailed eagle, which is one of the world's largest birds of prey.

Following a dramatic decline in its numbers and extinction in some countries between 1800 and 1970, the bird has made an impressive recovery.

Thanks
to legal protection, the European population grew from fewer than 2,500
pairs in 1970 to 9,600 pairs in 2010 and the species has recently 
recolonised parts of its former range in northern and central Europe.

Populations of the Spanish imperial eagle rose by 734 per cent.

The Iberian lynx (pictured) was limited to the southwestern part of the Iberian peninsula by the mid-1960s. There are fewer than 200 animals in the wild. They have suffered due to hunting, habitat loss and road accidents, but the most critical threat today is the reduced numbers of wild Rabbits within the lynx's range

The European bison, which is the largest herbivore in Europe, became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss.

However, a large-scale breeding and reintroduction programme based on individuals remaining in captivity has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern Europe.

Poland and Belarus are the stronghold for the rekindled species, which now has a population of almost 3,000 individuals.

The Eurasian spoonbill (pictured) declined dramatically after the 19th century as a result of habitat loss, caused mainly by drainage of wetlands. With the establishment of international treaties and conventions, the majority of breeding sites are now protected across its range in Europe

Numbers of Pyrenean ibex have risen by 855 per cent since 1960, while populations of grey wolves are up 303 per cent since 1970.

Frans Schepers, managing director of Rewilding Europe, said: 'Wildlife will bounce back if we allow it to – this report shows that.

'With continued and strong legal protection, active boosting of existing wildlife populations and reintroductions to bring back lost species, combined with an increasing tolerance towards wildlife, more species will surely follow.'

While the study focuses on 27 species of mammals and birds, ZSL said the comeback is not limited to these animals as there are many more that are showing similar patterns of recovery.

However, they warn that despite a fightback from certain European species, biodiversity is still being lost and the findings of the report must be viewed in the context of large historical declines.

For carnivores like the Eurasian lynx 
and Grey wolf and many bird species including the Red kite, 
distributions and numbers had already declined dramatically from 
their historical levels by the mid-20th century.

At 16 kilos and with a 3 metre wing span, the Dalmatian pelican is one of the world's heaviest flying birds. It has made a very successful comeback in the last 30 years, thanks mainly to nature protection measures. Lake Kerkini is one of the most productive fish waters in Europe, and supports thousands of the birds

The scientists said wildlife
resurgence should be assessed cautiously, as many species have 
not yet reached the level necessary to secure sustainable populations.

Member of the European Parliament,Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, said: 'This report shows first of all the amazing resilience of nature.

'The rewilding of Europe exceeds nature protection, because these iconic species create unique opportunities for rural development.'
