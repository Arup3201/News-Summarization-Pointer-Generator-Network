A 94-year-old man alleged to have worked as a medic in Auschwitz has been charged with 3,681 counts of accessory to murder because prosecutors say his actions would have enabled the death camp to keep running. 

Schwerin prosecutors' spokesman Stefan Urbanek said today the suspect was a former SS sergeant who served in an SS hospital at the Nazi death camp in occupied Poland.

Urbanek said through this role the man helped the extermination camp to function and he can therefore be charged as an accessory to the brutal killings.

Urbanek would not release the suspect's name in line with privacy laws.

The man is one of 30 people under investigation because they are suspected to have held roles in Auschwitz during the Second World War. 

Federal investigators recommended back in 2013 that state prosecutors pursue charges against them under a new precedent in German law.

The man's attorney, Peter-Michael Diestel, told the Bild newspaper there's no evidence of any 'concrete criminal act' by his client.

Officials say the man helped the extermination camp to function and he can therefore be charged as an accessory to the brutal killings - 1.1 million people are believed to have been murdered at the camp

The arrest comes less than a week after a 93-year-old man was charged with 170,000 counts of accessory to murder on allegations he served as an SS guard at  Auschwitz.

The defendant allegedly served in Auschwitz between January 1942 to June 1944, the Detmold state court said last week.

It is claimed this second man was assigned to the Auschwitz I camp but also helped supervise new prisoners, largely Jews, as they arrived in Auschwitz-Birkenau - the part of the camp where most of its 1.1million victims were killed.

Defense attorney Johannes Salmen said his client has acknowledged being at Auschwitz I, but denies being assigned to Birkenau or being involved in killings.

The North-Rhine Westphalia centre said the accused was deployed to the Nazi death camp in January 1942.

While there it is alleged he worked as a member of the SS Death's Head guard battalion and was responsible for guarding trains of Jews arriving at the death camp.

He is also alleged to have worked in 'selection', which involved marking newly-arrived inmates for immediate death or sending them to work.

Last year Oskar Groening, also aged 93, was charged with 300,000 counts of accessory to murder for his role as a guard at the camp.

The sergeant worked at Auschwitz for two-and-a-half years and was charged with sorting the possessions of the inmates and collecting and tallying any money that was on them.

At least 1.1 million prisoners died at Auschwitz, around 90 per cent of them Jewish.

In one period between May and June 1944, 425,000 Hungarian Jews were sent there - around 300,000 were immediately sent to the gas chambers.

He was never punished after the war because a tribunal cleared him of involvement in 1948.

But Groening has openly talked about his time as a guard and said while he witnessed horrific atrocities, he didn't commit any crimes himself.

In 2005, he told Der Spiegel magazine he recalled one incident on 'ramp duty' when he heard a baby crying. 

'I saw another SS soldier grab the baby by the legs,' he said. 'He smashed the baby's head against the iron side of a truck until it was silent.'
