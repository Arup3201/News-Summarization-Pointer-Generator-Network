An obese man has been rescued from his Florida home by dozens of firefighters after falling and being trapped in his own home for more than 24 hours.

Palm Beach County Fire Rescue's bariatric unit removed the man, who weighs more than 500lbs, after devising a plan to enter the home, which was too cluttered to fit the team and stretcher.

Fire crews cut a hole in the back of the 63-year-old man's home and laid wooden planks on the ground from the home to the ambulance for the special stretcher bearing the man.

'We have one special unit in Palm Beach County that can handle patients that weigh up to 1,000lbs,' Palm Beach County Fire Rescue Public Information Officer Captain Albert Borroto told WPTV.

The man's best friend told reporters that the man called him for help Wednesday after he realized he was unable to get up.

'He called me this morning because he couldn't get up, and he couldn't get a hold of anyone else, said Don Estess.

According to Fox8, the man fell Tuesday and was unable to move until the fire crews arrived.

'To be perfectly honest with you, he's been this way - I've known the man for 25 years. He's just steadily, steadily... Never been married, never had kids,' Estess told WPTV.

Esty said his friend has a condition that causes him to retain a lot of water weight and that he's lonely. He did not want the rescue workers called, but Estess said there was no other way to get the man up.

The man was unhappy about crews cutting a hole in the back of his home, taking out a window and part of a wall, but they had no other choice.

'There's just not enough room... They can't get a stretcher through there,' Estess said.

The man was alert and speaking to firefighters as they removed him from his home. He has been taken to JFK Medical Center.
