In a report Dr Antony Seldon recommends charging parents who earn more than £80,000 for state school paces

Rich parents should be charged £20,000 a year for their children to attend the best state schools, a leading headmaster has said.

They would become liable for the fees if they had a combined household income of £80,000 a year or more.

Dr Anthony Seldon, master of £11,000-a-term Wellington College in Berkshire, also said private schools should set aside a quarter of places for poorer pupils.

Making the wealthy pay for state education would end the wasteful and unfair gap between the academic achievements and career prospects of the richest and poorest children in the UK, he argued.

In a report to be published by the Social Market Foundation think-tank on Wednesday, he said the money could be used to pay for more teachers and smaller classes.

Dr Seldon, who said he had discussed his plans with politicians from both main parties, added that the move was vital because social mobility in Britain had stalled, with poorer children unable to advance.

‘We have to end this unfair farce whereby middle-class parents dominate the best schools, when they could afford to pay, and even boast of their moral superiority in using the state system when all they are doing is squeezing out the poor from the best schools,’ he said.

His suggested starting point for fees – £80,000 – is the average income of the top 10 per cent of the population, but ‘the more the parents earn, the more they should pay’.

Dr Seldon, who is master at £11,000-a-term Wellington College in Berkshire, says private schools should reserve a quarter of all places for the poorest children

Families earning more than £200,000 a 
year with children at the most over-subscribed state schools would pay 
the most – up to £20,000 a year for a secondary place and £15,000 for a 
primary place, equivalent to the fees of a private school.

‘Grammar schools, popular academies and comprehensives would be the most expensive schools,’  Dr Seldon said.

Just 3 per cent of pupils at the country’s 166 grammar schools come from the poorest homes.

Dr
 Seldon added it was only fair that if parents could afford to pay for 
better schooling – secured by buying houses in the right catchment areas
 or paying for private tutors to help their children pass grammar school
 entry exams – they should be made to do so.

‘Instead of estate agents and private tutors getting rich, let’s  put this money into the state system,’ he said.

Parents are paying an average of £31,500 more for a house near the top 30 state schools, according to research by Lloyds, while one in three parents say they have moved to be closer to one.

According to the Lloyds research the 
most expensive catchment area around Henrietta Barnett all-girls grammar
 school in Barnet, north-west London, where the average house price 
includes a premium of 87%, or £402,600. 

Whissendine C of E primary school was recently named by Tatler magazine as one of the best in the country, and an average house in the village costs £316,000, compared with just £209,000 for a property nearby Melton Mowbray.

Likewise in Marton, North Yorkshire, where Marton-Cum-Grafton school is located, houses go for an average of £404,000, up 5 per cent on last year, whereas a similar houses in York sell for just £235,000.
