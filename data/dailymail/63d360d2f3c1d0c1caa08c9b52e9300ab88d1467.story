Deported: Mauritian student Yashika Bageerathi said she is 'alone and scared' as she arrived back in her home country

Deported Mauritian student Yashika Bageerathi said she is 'alone and scared', and does not know what to do as she arrived back in her home country with nowhere to stay.

The 19-year-old said she was being looked at as if she 'was a criminal' when she landed in Mauritius after being deported from the UK on Wednesday night.

A number of last-minute attempts were made to prevent her being sent to Mauritius, including an emergency court order and an appeal from 
chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee Keith Vaz.

Following her arrival on an Air
 Mauritius flight, the teenager was immediately interviewed by police, 
and is now looking for somewhere safe to stay, according to her 
headteacher.

Miss Bageerathi came to the UK with her 
mother, sister and brother in 2011 to escape a relative who she said was
 physically abusive, and claimed asylum last summer.

'I am just all alone here, everyone is in England,' she told ITV News via Skype from Mauritius

'I don't know what to do.'

She confirmed that four security guards flew with her and said: 'I just wanted to do everything lawfully and I was just doing everything being asked.'

She said she was scared, adding: 'Even today I was told media people (were) waiting for me at the airport and even walking in the airport people were looking at me like I was a criminal.'

Friends, family, politicians and her 
school have all campaigned to push back her deportation until she had 
finished studying for her A levels, but to no avail.

Anger: Demonstrators gathered in Parliament Square, London, on Saturday to protest against the deportation of student Yashika Bageerathi

Asked what her message was to politicians, she said: 'I really want to complete my education and it's just so hard being here.

'I want to be there with my friends, in school with my teachers.'

When she was posed the question of what she would do next, she said: 'I don't know, still trying to make arrangements.'

Miss Bageerathi was due to take her A-level exams next month, with the first on May 14 and the final one will be held on June 23.

She said she did not think she could complete her education in Mauritius.

'I don't think I can, with all the people watching me and all the media wanting to talk to me about what (is) happening - I don't know, it's just so annoying and unfair,' she said.

'It's really unfair to come to know I was coming back on the same day and not inform me before.'

Lynne Dawes, headteacher at Oasis Academy Hadley in Enfield, north London, said the school was in regular contact with the promising student and the immediate concern was to find her a safe place to stay.

She said they were working to ensure she would still be able to complete her A-levels.

Ms Dawes said the student felt 'low' and added: 'She's feeling the lowest I have heard her be for quite a while.

'She was also very subdued.'

Thwarted: Even last-minute attempts by Keith Vaz MP to stop the deportation failed after he wrote to the Home Secretary to ask her to 'urgently reconsider' the decision

A spokesman for the Oasis charity, 
which runs the academy, said they were supporting the family, as well as
 the student, who he described as 'very frightened'.

He added: 'Yashika's mum is very upset understandably, she's very emotional and she's very worried.

'Worry is the overriding feeling.'

Previous attempts to deport Miss Bageerathi were thwarted when Air Mauritius refused to fly her out following an earlier refusal by British Airways - but Air Mauritius later confirmed it had received a 'directive' from the UK authorities that the youngster must leave.

The deportation followed a judge at London's Law Courts refusing to grant an emergency injunction to block the deportation to give her time to take her case to the Court of Appeal.

The last-ditch application was made yesterday as the youngster was being driven from Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire to Heathrow airport.

Even last-minute attempts by Keith Vaz MP to stop the deportation failed after he wrote to the Home Secretary to ask her to 'urgently reconsider' the decision.

In his letter to Theresa May yesterday, Mr Vaz said: 'It is hardship enough for this young woman to be separated from her family and returned to Mauritius, where she claims she fears persecution.

'To interrupt her education at this late stage in order to do so seems needlessly cruel.'

Miss Bageerathi, whose case sparked a petition that has attracted around 178,000 signatures, had been detained at Yarl's Wood since March 19.

Paul Nettleship, one of the solicitors for Miss Bageerathi and her mother, said the options were limited for the student but they were looking into pursuing an out of country appeal.

He said: 'We're looking into it but the problem is that even if we can do that, it will be after her exams.'
