Once again the rumours turned out to be true - Apple has confirmed it is holding another launch event on October 22, just a month after its latest iPhones hit the shelves.

Invites have been sent to journalists entitled 'We still have a lot to cover.' The invitation additionally shows a number of colourful leaves about the Apple logo in the background.

Experts believe the tech giant could be about to announce a new iPad mini as well as an improved iPad - dubbed iPad 5 - at the Tuesday event. 

Apple has sent official press invites, pictured, to a launch event taking place in London on Tuesday. The firm is expected to launch its next generation iPads at the event, including the iPad 5 and the iPad mini 2. The design suggests Apple could be introducing colours to its new tablets, in the way it did with the iPhone 5C

This would be almost a year to the day since Apple's CEO Tim Cook unveiled the first generation mini, and the release would see the tablets go on sale in time for Christmas.

Apple historically launches products on a Tuesday, making them available for pre-order the following Friday, before putting them on sale the Friday of the week after.

This suggests any new devices announced on 22 October will be on sale by 1 November.

Leaked photos have already hinted at what the tablets could look like, including a range of colourful cases, and in an investor note analysts state Apple could also be working on a 13-inch model.

Barclays Equity Research claimed the latest 64-bit architecture - seen in Microsoft's new Surface 2 tablet - could pave the way for a
13-inch iPad designed to appeal to laptop users.

The 64-bit models are said to be more powerful and can handle more multitasking functions. 

Rumours in August also claimed suppliers in China had been asked to ship larger displays, potentially for use on new Apple products.

A new range of iPads are expected to launch on 22 October. These leaked images from technology site Tactus, allegedly show the rear shell of the iPad 5, pictured, with coloured cases. Apple could also unveil a second-generation iPad mini

Analyst Gene Munster, from investment firm Piper Jaffray, surveyed 799 people about Apple's rumoured iWatch.

It found 3 per cent of iPhone owners would consider buying the wearable device.

There are said to be around 293 million Apple customers, suggesting this would equate to between eight and 10 million units sold in the first year.

Respondents were also asked if they would be willing to buy the iWatch for around $350 (£217) with 12 per cent admitting they'd be willing to pay this price.

The rest of the people who said they'd be interested in an iWatch said they would pass on the gadget if it cost this much.

During the iPhone announcement on 10 September, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new 
hardware, software and services that we can’t wait to introduce this Fall and throughout 2014.'

The current iPad mini came out in 
November 2012 and if Apple follows suit, this would confirm a 
mid-October announcement followed by an early-November sale date, in
time for Christmas. 

The price of the current iPads is also being cut in various regions, suggesting a new tablet is coming.

It's likely the iPad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9-inch screen and not drop to 7-inches, in a bid to stay slightly bigger than Google's Nexus 7, Tesco's new Hudl and the MyTablet from Argos.

If Apple adds the Retina display seen on its new iPhones and larger iPads, its possible the second-generation iPad mini will be heavier and thicker.

However, leaked photos of the casing suggest it will be thinner, meaning Apple may wait to add the high-definition display to later models.

According to Apple site, 9to5Mac, the rumoured iPad 5 will also keep the 9.7-inch, high-resolution screen seen on older models.

The camera is due an upgrade, too, and is thought Apple would move to an 8MP rear-facing lens, with the possibility of 
even a 12MP camera being added.

Leaked images from Tactus additionally suggest the iPad 5 will be thinner than its predecessors.

Technology site Expert Reviews believes Apple will stick with its traditional pricing strategy for both models and charge the same price for its new products as it did for the outgoing models.

For example, the 16GB iPad 5 is expected to cost around £399, this raises to £479 for 32GB and £559 for 64GB.

If Apple additionally follows its 
iPad 4 launch and introduces a 128GB iPad 5 model, this should start at 
around £639 for 128GB, while 4G-ready models will cost more still.

Similarly, the iPad mini is expected 
to launch with at around £269 for 16GB and then in £80 increments for 
the 32BG and 64GB models. Models with 3G and 4G access will cost more.

Apple could also launch a new line of Mac computers including a Macbook Pro and Mac mini at the event.

Both are expected to be fitted with Intel’s Haswell processors that boost speeds and battery life.
