The tell-all autobiography of Little House On The Prairie author Laura Ingalls Wilder has emerged as a surprise publishing hit, with readers rushing to snap up the gritty account of pioneer life.

First published in November by the tiny South Dakota Historical Society Press, Pioneer Girl: The Annotated Autobiography, offers an unvarnished view of life in the Midwest in the 19th century, a marked departure from the bucolic imagery of the beloved Little House series.

The not-safe-for-children tales include stark scenes of domestic abuse, love triangles gone awry and a man who lit himself on fire while drunk off whiskey.

Runaway hit: Readers have been rushing to snap up copies of Laura Ingalls Wilder's no-holds-barred autobiography Pioneer Girl, which hit the shelves in November

Wilder and her daughter Rose Wilder 
Lane, herself a well-known author, tried and failed to get an edited 
version of the autobiography published throughout the early 1930s.

The
 original rough draft has been preserved at the Laura Ingalls Wilder 
Historic Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri, for decades but hadn't 
been published.

The children's series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 never presented an entirely romanticized version of life on the prairie - in Little House In The Big Woods, Laura and her sister Mary gleefully help dissect the family pig before bouncing its inflated bladder back and forth in the yard.

But the series also left out or fictionalized scenes that Wilder deemed unsuitable for kids, including much of the time the family spent in Burr Oak, Iowa, and Walnut Grove, Minnesota, according to Pamela Smith Hill, a Wilder biographer and the lead editor on the autobiography.

'So you can read Pioneer Girl as nonfiction rather than fiction and get a better feeling of how the historical Ingalls family really lived, what their relationships were and how they experienced the American West,' she said.

TV hit: Wilder's series of 11 novels published between 1932 and 1943 were adapted for TV in the 1970s. The show ran for nine seasons 

Wilder details a scene from her childhood in Burr Oak, in which a neighbor of the Ingalls' pours kerosene throughout his bedroom, sets it on fire and proceeds to drunkenly drag his wife around by her hair before Wilder's father - Pa in the children's books - intervenes.

Scenes like that make Wilder's memoir sound like it's filled with scandal and mature themes, 'which isn't exactly true either,' according to Amy Lauters, an associate professor of mass media at Minnesota State University-Mankato.

'It's just that that first version was blunt, it was honest. It was full of the everyday sorts of things that we don't care to think about when we think about history,' Lauters said last August.

'And it's certainly not the fantasized version we saw on Little House on the Prairie the television show.'

The autobiography preserves Wilder's original rough draft - misspellings, idiosyncrasies and all - but adds extensive annotations.

Little House lovers can learn about the three girls that Wilder combined to create the Nellie Olson character, or how extensive the damage was in Minnesota during the grasshopper plague of the 1870s, which forced Pa in On The Banks Of Plum Creek to set out in search of work.

'In some ways, I came to think of the annotations in Pioneer Girl as almost an encyclopedia about Laura Ingalls Wilder's life and work,' Hill said.

Hard knock life: Caroline and Charles Ingalls, known as Ma and Pa in the series, had financial problems and bounced from one apartment to the next 

Speaking to AFP this week, Nancy Tystad Koupal, the director of the publishing house, said they decided to release Wilder's first draft because it painted an honest picture of American pioneers' hardscrabble life, warts and all. 

In the TV show, the character of Laura Ingalls Wilder was played by Melissa Gilbert

'At the time, life was hard. Violence was typical. It was part of the pioneers' life,' Koupal said.

The author's large family struggled financially and could not afford to buy a house of their own, forcing them to bounce from one apartment to the next.

'They had to flee in the middle of the night to avoid paying rent,' Koupal said.  

In another episode from her adventures in the Midwest, Wilder tells about  a sick woman whose drunk husband tried to rape her. The author only escaped by fighting back.

Wilder's books were adapted for TV in 1974 by Michael Landon who also starred on the show. It ran for nine seasons, comprising more than 200 episodes.

The 'Little House' books and TV show were enjoyed by several generations of Americans readers and viewers, which could explain the unexpected success of the new memoir.   

With sales being bolstered by news stories and radio segments about the new book, it has climbed up the Amazon bestseller list, and even briefly overtook Chris Kyle's American Sniper for the top spot last week.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Wilder's memoir remained at the top of the US History books list and in fifth spot on the overall list of best sellers. 

Since its publication two months ago, orders for the autobiography have exploded.

Manuscript: The original manuscript of Pioneer Girl was written on tablet paper with lead pencil

An initial print-run of 15,000 was sold out within a few weeks. The historical society then placed orders for another 15,000 followed by another 45,000 books. 

The editor of the book, Pamela Smith Hill, took it upon herself research the events and dates mentioned in Wilder's original manuscript to make sure all of the information was accurate.

'We had to check if her memory was correct,' Koupal said.'It is her autobiography, but she wrote it when she was 60, and sometimes, memory fails.'
