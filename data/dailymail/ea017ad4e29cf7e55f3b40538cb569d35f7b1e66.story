As England take stock ahead of surely the defining match of this Six Nations against Ireland, my advice would be: ‘Don’t buy into the cliches. Don’t waste a second about what is meant to happen and how such a massive occasion is meant to play out. Just have the confidence to produce your A game, execute and win.’

Rugby is full of these cliches and they can get into your head. ‘You never know which French team are going to turn up’; ‘The Italian pack will always make life difficult’; ‘The South Africans will always out-muscle you up front’; ‘New Zealand run the ball from everywhere’; ‘The Australians can’t scrummage’; ‘Playing Ireland on a wet afternoon in Dublin is hell’; ‘You must silence the crowd in Cardiff’, etc.

These expressions are redundant. Before the Wales game I was amazed that so many pundits talked up Wales, at home, as strong favourites with their phalanx of great Lions from 2013. Absolutely meaningless.

I looked at the two teams and asked myself how many of the Wales players would make a Lions starting XV on current form and there weren’t many. From the off, I was convinced England, injuries or no injuries, would win.

Before the Italy game I got some stick and was accused of arrogance because I insisted that victory was a given and England should look to score 50 points against the Italians, a team I have a lot of time for and who have an important role to play in the Six Nations.

I just looked at the two line-ups on the day and assessed what should happen if England hit their straps. In the end England clocked up 47 after a patchy start and should probably have scored 25 more.

The next step for England — who are beginning to excite us with their development and ambition — is for them to have total confidence in their ability and ignore all these old stereotypes.

They are good enough now to shape the game themselves. Rugby at this level is about spending 85 per cent of your time on what you do — put the result in your own hands and let the opposition worry about how you are going to play.

More will be written and said in the next two weeks before the game in Dublin than for any rugby match in a long time. Outside the England bubble, rugby fans can lap it up. But inside the England camp, just keep it factual and focus on your game plan.

Ireland are a very good side with many world-class players — notably Jonny Sexton and Paul O’Connell — and an extremely astute coach in Joe Schmidt who is one of the very best and is loving this role.

Ireland are very fit — they demonstrated that with how they soaked up French pressure in the final quarter —they keep it simple and with Cian Healy returning and Sean O’Brien back in the groove they will be at full strength when England arrive. Why they are at full strength and England still have players missing has been well documented in these pages.

Ireland demand total respect but, on current form, more England players would get in the Ireland team than vice-versa. England have a better scrum and line-out and can win the battle at the breakdown. The England backs have been earning most of the plaudits but it’s time for the pack to take centre stage again.

England and Ireland are both on an upward curve and have real momentum. For England this match is exactly the kind of game they will have to negotiate if they are to reach the World Cup final. Any win in Cardiff or Dublin is a great victory but, if we are serious about becoming the best team in the world, they are results that England need to become comfortable with and expect of themselves.

They need to carry the mind-set: ‘We are England and we will win this game.’ This is not arrogance, this is the mind-set of champions. The Federers, Bolts, Redgraves, Adlingtons and Hoys of this world.

I would ease down on the training in the build-up, even though the temptation is to work the team hard. Less is sometimes more. I would have plenty of walk-throughs but the priority must be to keep everybody sharp mentally.

I wouldn’t be afraid to tweak a winning team. Again we wait on fitness reports on Courtney Lawes because he is always an England starter for me if fit but Stuart Lancaster must be reassured how well Dave Attwood and George Kruis have been doing, so it’s not an issue.

Ireland will use Sexton’s kicking game to attack England’s back three so England must address that in training and it will be complicated by whether Mike Brown passes his concussion protocols.

England will want their best footballing back three on the park and Brown, if fit, and Watson clearly start but there might be a debate around Jonny May, who is more of an out-and-out wing.

That debate is fair enough but against Ireland I would only consider bringing somebody in if they add something to the mix and have a superior defensive and kicking game to May — given how organised Ireland’s catch, kick and chase game is. I’m not sure there is anybody who fits that description.

Finally, are England becoming slow starters? It would be easy to get distracted and misinterpret this. They went 10-0 behind to Wales and conceded an early try against Italy but I’m not sure a slow start per se is the problem. Against Wales they took the Welsh apart at an early scrum but Toby Faletau miraculously rescued the situation to create Wales’ try.

Against Italy, England didn’t get it right from the kick-off, passing the ball across the line looking for something to happen. No problem running the ball from the first whistle if it is on but against Italy it was not on and they took some time to recover.

If in any doubt, play some phases and bang the ball straight back, put in an aggressive chase and start playing in the opposition half where you can start thinking about getting the scoreboard ticking, including drop goals very early.

England need to be very alert tactically in those opening exchanges against Ireland — at kick-offs and re-starts for example. Don’t kick the ball deep and give Sexton an easy kick, go for the short option and contest every scrap of possession from the off. Get that England pack into the game as soon as possible.

Above all, play in the present. Don’t give any thought to what has happened in the past and how Ireland matches with England are meant to unravel. Just play your game and the opposition. That is what champion teams do.
