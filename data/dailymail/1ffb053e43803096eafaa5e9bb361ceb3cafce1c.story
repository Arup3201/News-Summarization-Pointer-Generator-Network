As Dylan Hartley serves his latest ban for violent conduct, it will not have escaped the Northampton hooker’s notice that Tom Youngs is in the form of his life.

Fully fit following the shoulder surgery that caused him to miss the autumn internationals, Hartley’s nearest rival for the England No 2 shirt has been outstanding since returning for Leicester in late November.

Last Saturday Youngs produced a prodigious display as the Tigers gained revenge for their early- season mauling at the hands of Bath — the game in which he suffered a serious dislocation — and in doing so put another international rival, Rob Webber, firmly in the shade.

With little over four weeks until England start their RBS 6 Nations campaign against Wales in Cardiff, the hooker’s jersey worn 61 times by Hartley is fast becoming Youngs’ to lose.

‘If there is a better hooker in England after the weekend I don’t know who he is,’ said Leicester director of rugby and former England No 2 Richard Cockerill on Wednesday.

‘Tommy has been outstanding for us. His attitude is first rate, he doesn’t worry about anything, he gets stuck in. If Webber has any pretensions of playing at Test level in front of Tom Youngs, you saw at the weekend the difference: the ball-carrying, the mentality, the mauling.

‘Tom is in a different league from Hartley and from Webber.’

One would expect Cockerill to back his man, but on the evidence of the past six weeks it is hard to argue against him. Stuart Lancaster’s promise to ‘pick on form’ will be put to the test if Youngs can maintain his upward trajectory until the end of the month.

‘I’m just glad to be back playing again,’ said Youngs, who will be hoping to add to his 17 caps.

‘If other people are playing well then fair enough, but as long as you’re making the coach scratch his head that’s all you can do.’

The 26-year-old, who converted from centre to hooker only five years ago, has been criticised in the past for his wayward line-out throwing but insists he has ‘kicked on again’ in one facet of his art where Hartley retains an edge.

But in terms of carrying, breakdown work and link-play, Youngs is his equal, while a disciplinary record of just two yellow cards in the past two seasons gives him a colossal advantage over his combustible Northampton rival.

‘Hartley has more poor days at the office than Tom Youngs,’ added Cockerill. ‘Tom’s discipline and attitude to physicality is right on the line. It is not over the line, it is not under the line, it is right on it every time he plays. I don’t know what Tommy’s disciplinary record is but I think it is a lot better than the other bloke (Hartley). Even mine is better than that!’

The pair’s last encounter saw Hartley last only 16 minutes before receiving a straight red card for elbowing Matt Smith in a brutal East Midlands derby at Franklin’s Gardens shortly before Christmas.

It also landed him a three-week ban that has allowed his less experienced rival to steal a march ahead of next month’s Six Nations. In World Cup year, it could prove Hartley’s most costly indiscretion yet.

Youngs said: ‘I went through a stage of getting stroppy on the pitch when I was on loan at Nottingham but I realised I wasn’t really helping anyone out.

‘When I moved to hooker I had to earn the respect to play in the front row and felt that when someone punched me I had to punch them back. I was a centre moving to hooker and everyone wanted a bit of me. But I realised after a while I wasn’t doing myself or my team much good.’

It is a lesson Hartley still hasn’t absorbed, despite an ever- lengthening charge sheet, and Lancaster will have to consider if his most experienced forward is worth taking another chance on at the Millennium Stadium on February 6.

The England coach is unlikely to be able to select Youngs’s clubmates Dan Cole (foot) or Manu Tuilagi (groin) for the tournament opener against Wales after Cockerill revealed yesterday that neither player is likely to feature before the last weekend in January.

Meanwhile, Wasps yesterday confirmed former England wing Tom Varndell has signed for Championship side Bristol. Leinster fly-half Jimmy Gopperth will join Wasps next season, while stand-off Andy Goode has been offered a coaching role at the Ricoh Arena.

On a busy day of transfer activity, Northampton announced the signing of 22-year-old Munster fly-half JJ Hanrahan and Samoa flanker TJ Ioane has joined Sale.
