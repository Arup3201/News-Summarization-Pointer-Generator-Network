Its neat hedges and leafy streets convey an image of conservatism and Home Counties respectability.

But commuter-belt Surrey was revealed yesterday as the biggest readers of ‘mummy porn’ erotica Fifty Shades of Grey than anywhere else in the country.

Readers ‘just can’t get enough’ of the tales of bondage, according to senior council officials - who have branded their own county ‘Saucy Surrey’.

Picturesque: But behind the leafy highways and byways, Surrey is a hotbed of sizzling S&M sensuality. The county has been revealed as the biggest devourer of the erotic Fifty Shades books

Libraries are lending more copies of the racy book and its two sequels than in other parts of the country.

Borrowing in Surrey accounted for nearly 20 per cent of all UK loans of the three books last August.

And more recent figures show demand for the trilogy shows little sign of slowing down, with Surrey’s libraries making up almost 16 per cent of all recorded national lending in October.

Helyn Clack, Surrey County Council’s cabinet member for community services, said the libraries had stocked up on 200 copies of each of EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed as they rocketed up the bestseller list.

She said: ‘EL James’ books have really set the pulses racing in Surrey.

‘It seems our library-goers just can’t get enough of Christian Grey’s steamy antics.

‘While the trilogy of stories won’t suit every taste, we stock around 190,000 new books a year for people to choose from, including the latest from hugely popular authors like Ian Rankin and John Grisham.’

The three books – Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed – charts the complicated and racy relationship of young graduate Anastasia Steele and damaged business tycoon Christian Grey.

Fifty Shades of Grey became the bestselling book in Britain since records began in August last year, surpassing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows with sales of 5.3million copies.

The 5.3million figure comprised 3.8million paper books and 1.5million e-books.

The book has sold 65million copies worldwide.

Tandridge in Surrey was last year named the housewife capital of Britain.

The district has the highest number of housewives of anywhere in the country, a study found, making up 64 per cent of the district’s female population.

The top ten areas for the highest number of housewives included several other districts in the county.

Mrs James, 49, wrote for TV crime dramas Silent Witness and Wire In The Blood before she found fame with Fifty Shades of Grey.

The book is due to be turned into a Hollywood film, after the screen rights to the novel were acquired by Universal Pictures and Focus Features in March.
