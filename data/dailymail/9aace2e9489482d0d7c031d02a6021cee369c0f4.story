The Gandhi scion will be away for 'three or four weeks' on a 'finding-himself journey'

The day Parliament kicked off its Budget Session, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi surprised even his own party members by proceeding on a “leave of absence for a few weeks”. 

The development immediately spawned barbs from various quarters, including social media, and left the Congress battling extreme embarrassment. 

Seeking to clear the air in the aftermath of growing speculation about Rahul’s move, a senior Congress leader close to the Gandhi family told Mail Today that the heir will take over as the party president as early as in April or June. 

“Since he wants to reinvent the party, he will bring in his own team. Rahul wants to restructure the party and take it out of the clutches of the old guard. But the process isn’t easy since the old retainers are understandably unwilling to relinquish their control and power over the Congress,” the leader said on the condition of anonymity. 

He added: “Rahul wants the makeover exercise to be bloodless so that the new Congress feeds into the aspirations of the nation’s people.” 

Introspection 

The leader clarified that the Gandhi scion will be away for “three or four weeks” on a “finding- himself journey” while he contemplates taking charge of the Congress.

“The defeat in the 2014 general elections made him understand that India is changing rapidly. Rahul understands the aspirations and ambitions of the people and wants the party to be at the cutting edge of the nation’s new polity,” he added. 

But even some senior party men found the “introspection for the Congress’ course of action” reasoning hard to digest, especially since the crucial first week will see the tabling of the railway and general budgets. 

“It came as a surprise to me. I got the news from the official briefing. There must be some compelling reason for Rahul to take leave,” senior party leader Anil Shastri told Mail Today.

#WhereisRahul was trending on social networking sites, where a deluge of tweets made light of the presumed fourth-generation heir of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty’s absence from the House. 

“Whatever we wanted to say has been said. I am not going to add anything to this,” Congress chief Sonia Gandhi told newspersons, adding: “Give him a few weeks.” 

As Rahul’s leave and its timing stirred up a controversy, party insiders explained that he was on an “atm chintan” (self-introspection) mission to draw up a blueprint for bringing the Congress back on track after the recent humiliating election defeats. 

The surprise leave plan was announced despite the Congress having earlier decided to target the NDA government in a big way on the land ordinance issue. Rahul himself was scheduled to lead a party agitation at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday. 

The expectation of Rahul attending the Jantar Mantar protest, coming two days after Anna Hazare’s demonstration at the same venue, had been building up as he had walked the dusty lanes of villages Bhatta-Parsaul in western Uttar Pradesh in 2011 to protest against forcible land acquisition of farmers. 

The Congress immediately jumped in to control the damage. 

“You think he is a fool that he did not know the risk involved (in being absent during the Budget Session and the obvious criticism it would follow)?” a senior AICC functionary asked. 

AICC meet in mind 

“He (Rahul) believes that the AICC session (expected in the first week of April) is vital and he would like to give specific inputs on this. He wants to introspect about what happened with regard to the Congress in recent times and earlier,” party spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said. 

“It has nothing to do with his role in the party. He has gone to reflect on party affairs and not on his role,” he added. 

One of the reasons cited by party sources for his action was that Rahul was miffed over the resistance he has been facing to his reform plans from “entrenched elements” in the Congress. 

But Singhvi said all the ideas germinated and nurtured by Rahul were being implemented in the party. The Congress remained tight-lipped about his whereabouts. The political grapevine has it that he could be anywhere from Europe to South East Asia. 

“All speculative questions are denied,” Singhvi said.
