The average modern Briton earns almost £25,000, drives a Ford and lives in a detached house worth £279,000 a study revealed yesterday.

Research carried out among 2,000 adults also found that half believe they are ‘middle class’, while 48 per cent opted to declare themselves as ‘working class’.

And family background was named as the key factor in determining class, along with your job or career and the house you live in.

Nothing out of the ordinary: The average Briton lives in a detached house, earns nearly £25,000 and drives a Ford

But while almost two thirds of people think social class is still important in today’s society, just one in three have aspirations to climb the social ladder.

A spokesman for 4DVD, which commissioned the study to mark the release of comedy drama Shameless Series 9, said: 'Social class was once massively important in defining who you are, with people doing everything they could to climb up the ladder.

'While social class has less importance in today’s society, it seems that people still clearly define themselves as either working, middle or upper class.

'And it seems the middle-class is made up of Mr and Mrs Average with those who consider themselves to be in the social group earning an average wage, driving an average car and living in an average home.

'But while your family background seems to be the main factor in determining your social class, it seems more material things such as the house you live in or even the car you drive can also have an effect.

Lives in a detached home worth £278,714 with three bedrooms

'While Frank Gallagher has found himself a job, judging by these results, it looks like he still has a way to go before he can call himself middle class.'

The study also revealed that the average ‘middle class’ Briton holds down a full-time job earning a salary of £24,744.

And combined with their partner’s wages they have a household income of around £43,592.

‘Middle class’ Britons also live in a three-bedroom detached home worth an average of £278,714.

Researchers also found that those who consider themselves to be middle class own one car per household - most likely to be a Ford, Vauxhall or Toyota.

They also holiday in Europe on self-catering package holidays and have an average of £25,963 in savings or tied up in investments.

And in their spare time, the middle classes enjoy reading, going for walks in the countryside, shopping, keeping up-to-date with current affairs and going to the cinema.

The study also revealed that Britons think genetics and family background has the biggest effect on which class you are in, followed by your job or career.

Salary, the type of home you live in and the money or savings you have to your name complete the top five factors that define your class.

The car you drive, material possessions and even hobbies also help people also determine whether you are working, middle or upper class.

But while 64 per cent think social class is still important in today’s society, just one in twenty said it is important to them to fit into a certain group.

And just 35 per cent have an ambition to move up the social ladder, with getting a better paid job the plan for 59 per cent of those.

Other ways social climbers hope to move up were named as changing careers altogether, moving house and even marrying into a well-off or influential family.

Researchers also found that 90 per cent of people think there are certain stereotypes about the different social classes.

And 74 per cent of Brits think that certain aspects of your personality or life can mean you get grouped into a certain social class.
