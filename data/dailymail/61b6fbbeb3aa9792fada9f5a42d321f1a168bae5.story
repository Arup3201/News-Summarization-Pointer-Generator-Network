Apple may have smashed its own sales records in September by selling nine million handsets in just 
three days, but figures do not appear to have remained anywhere near that high since.

An inside source has told Chinese website C Technology sales of the cheaper iPhone 5C have been 'dismal' and Apple has halved production of the plastic model as a result.

The suppliers claim they have gone from making 300,000 handsets a day, on average, to just 150,000 and there are also reports prices are dropping across the region in a bid to attract buyers.

Although demand for the plastic iPhone in China is said to be 'soft', the colourful range is proving popular in the UK.

Reports from iPhoneStockChecker.co.uk, found that the pink 
model accounts for 46 per cent of sales - almost more than all the 
other colours combined.

The blue model is the second most-popular device, accounting for 32 per cent of 5C sales.

In
third place is green, at 12 per cent, followed by white at 9 per cent 
and yellow brings up the rear, accounting for just 1 per cent of sales.

The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the first time Apple had made the handsets available in China from launch.

Previously, Apple launched handsets in key regions including the UK and the U.S and would roll out the handsets to other areas, including China, in the following months.

C Technology claim that although the iPhone 5C was touted as a cheaper option, it costs a similar amount and has 'no particular highlights - making it unappealing to new buyers.

The site adds that although prices of the iPhone 5S have remained high, the cost of the iPhone 5C has also dipped in certain areas from 4,488 yuan (£459) to 3,500 yuan (£358).

In an investor note last week, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said: 'During our visit to Apple stores and resellers this week in China, we have found that there is healthy interest in the iPhone 5C.

'However, we believe this has not yet translated into exciting volume levels in China.'

He continued that Apple would need to reduce the price further to attract new buyers, claiming demand had been 'soft.'

When the company unveiled the iPhone 5S and 5C at the start of September, shares fell by around five per cent.

Following the launch a week later, shares rose more than 5 per cent to $493.47, and counteracted the initial losses.

Last
year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in
September 2012, yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this
year's two - and it wasn't sold in China from launch.

Apple was unavailable for comment.
