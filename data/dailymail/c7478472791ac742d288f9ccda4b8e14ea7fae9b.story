Darcy Smith, 41, is accused of having sex with the boy - a former student - when he was just 14 years old and living at their home in Washington state

Former students of a Seattle area teacher charged with rape showed up at a King County courtroom in Kent Thursday to offer their support as she entered a plea of not guilty to a charge of child rape.

Students, some alongside their parents, carried signs that said 'We stand by you' and said they don't believe the allegations against Darcy Smith as they packed a Kent, Washington courtroom Thursday.

The 41-year-old Renton woman is accused of having sex with a student she took into her home as a troubled 12-year-old.

He said they started having sex two years later, sometimes while Smith's husband and children were in the other room.

He reported the incidents last year and is now 19.

Many of the students on hand in court Thursday told KIRO that Darcy was like a mother to them.

And one mother who was there to support Smith--who was once named a regional teacher of the year--can see why.

Kim Vea had four children in Smith's classes. She said they even called her "auntie."

'She was the finest I've ever met and she shouldn't be in this situation and I know she's innocent,' Kim Vea, whose children call Smith 'Auntie,' told KIRO. 

Smith was put on leave in August when the district learned of the investigation.

The alleged victim first reported the allegations to the King County Sheriff’s Office last May.

Smith has been on administrative leave since August, when her employer, the Highline School District, was informed of the boy’s claims.

He told detectives that he and Smith started having sex when he was in the 8th grade and the relationship continued until he moved out of her home at 18. 

Showing support: Students and parents piled into a Washington courtroom Thursday to show support for Smith, who's charged with having sex with a 14-year-old boy

There were so many people showing support in the courtroom that some had to sit in an overflow area

The boy had moved in with Smith and her family when he was 12 years old and a pupil in her 6th grade class, reports Seattle PI.  

The unusual arrangement had the blessing of the boy’s mother who didn’t speak English and though Smith would be a good influence on her son whose brother was in a gang. 

The boy told detective that Smith first showered him with gifts and affection before agreeing to care for him full time, according to charging papers.

But the victim said things would change in the evenings when the kids and Smith's husband went to bed, and she drank wine.

According to the documents, the victim said Smith made him promise not to tell anyone or 'she would go to jail and be in big trouble if he told.' 

The McMicken Heights sixth-grade teacher is free without bail until her next court appearance March 12.

Smith pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a child rape charge stemming from incidents the victim claims spanned years
