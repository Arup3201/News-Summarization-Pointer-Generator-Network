John W Henry is fond of talking about The Liverpool Way. But in one respect, the owner is moving away from the club’s traditional blueprint for success this summer by buying players in bulk order.

When Liverpool dominated the football landscape, they used to tweak their squad with one or two quality acquisitions each summer.

Now, with Luis Suarez gone and Champions League due to return, manager Brendan Rodgers has been given the green light to go for quantity – understandable in one way, but risky in another.

No Liverpool fan needs reminding that the last time one of their managers went on a trolley-dash, Graeme Souness ended up getting the sack after bringing in the likes of Paul Stewart, Julian Dicks, Neil Ruddock, Stig-Inge Bjornebye, David James, Nigel Clough and Torben Piechnik.

Liverpool have already signed six new players this summer; Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren and Divock Origi (who is heading back out on loan) from Lille.

Manchester City made five purchases last summer to make the leap from second to first that Liverpool are trying to emulate, but only two of them became first-team regulars.

Tottenham were more radical and signed seven first XI players to replace Gareth Bale. It didn’t work.

Rodgers will argue a deeper squad is necessary with Liverpool back playing Champions League football for the first time since 2009. He has tried to minimise the risk of upheaval by ensuring some of his new players have Premier League experience.

Lallana, Lambert and Lovren helped Southampton finish in the top half last. Even so, nobody knows how Benfica’s Lazar Markovic and Emre Can of Bayer Leverkusen – both aged 20 – will fare in their first season in the Premier League.

Been there, done that: Dejan Lovren is one of only three new signings with Premier League experience

Gamble: Brendan Rodgers has opted to revamp his squad with a number of new additions this summer

RICKIE LAMBERT (£4million from Southampton)

Premier League experience: Two seasons with Southampton, scoring 28 goals. Had turned 30 by the time he reached the top flight.

ADAM LALLANA (£25miliion from Southampton)

Premier League experience: Two seasons with Southampton where he played well enough to get an England call up.

LAZAR MARKOVIC (£20million from Benfica)

Premier League experience: None.

EMRE CAN (£10million from Bayer Leverkusen)

Premier League experience: None.

DEJAN LOVREN (£20million from Southampton)

Premier League experience: One season in England but did well at Southampton to earn a World Cup place for Croatia.

DIVOCK ORIGI (£10million from Lille)

Premier League experience: None.

Last season, Liverpool’s thrilling form was based on an almost telepathic understanding between Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and Suarez.

How can Lallana, for example, be on the same attacking wavelength when he returns from an injury lay-off? At 32, can Lambert adapt to the expectation at Anfield having spent the majority of his career in the lower leagues.

In a sense, Rodgers has had no choice but to deal. Suarez wanted to go and Liverpool will have more games to play next season. But it would be foolish to say this isn’t a gamble.

Mark Hughes struggled at Manchester City and QPR when he was backed by a wealthy owner who wanted lots of new players.

Even when his successor at City, Roberto Mancini, bought in quality stars like Yaya Toure and David Silva in 2010 they didn’t challenge for the title, only hitting form at the end of the season to win the FA Cup.

Chelsea’s manager at the time Carlo Ancelotti noted at the start of that season that City ‘didn’t have a clear identity’ as they shuffled the new signings about.

City did add five new signings last summer and won the title; Fernandinho, Jesus Navas, Stevan Jovetic, Alvaro Negredo and Martin Demichelis. But only Fernandinho and Demichelis were regular players at the business end of the season.

Expectation: Some fans have questioned whether 32-year-old Rickie Lambert can step up in the absence of Suarez next season

Tough start: Adam Lallana will need to bounce back from a six-week injury lay-off after joining for £25million

Rodgers’ biggest task will be to make sure last season’s successful players Sturridge, Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, Jordan Henderson, Jon Flanagan, Martin Skrtel and others don’t lose their mojo and have their form disrupted by an army of new signings.

Last season’s biggest turnover happened at Sunderland. They signed 14 players and Paolo Di Canio got the sack after admitting: ‘There are many players and many different languages - it is difficult to speak to each other.’

Nobody is suggesting Rodgers will be as unprepared as the maverick Italian. But Liverpool fans who think more is naturally better may be in for a shock.
