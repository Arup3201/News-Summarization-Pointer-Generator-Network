Nicola Sturgeon today revealed how she dodges domestic chores at home while her husband stays up late cleaning. 

The Scottish First Minister invited the cameras into her spotless house near Glasgow, which interviewer Susanna Reid looked like a 'show home'.

Ms Sturgeon credited her husband Peter, the SNP's chief executive, with staying up late to clean the house and admitted to being so bad in the kitchen she is on first name terms with her takeaway delivery driver.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon revealed how she irons her husband's shirts as a way of getting out of doing any other household chores

The SNP leader is poised to hold the balance of power if, as the polls predict, she oversees the wipeout of Labour north of the border.

In a revealing personal interview, she discussed balancing family life with running Scotland, not having children and how she likes to unwind at weekends.

The 44-year-old, who replaced Alex Salmond last year, admitted to finding ways to avoid helping out around the house.

Despite her husband Peter Murrell running the SNP, she told ITV's Good Morning Britain that all she does is irons his shirts.

'I've developed this thing that if I iron Peter's shirts on a Sunday night then that kind of gets me off the hook of any other domestic tasks because in my head that's me I've pulled my weight in the house, of the domestic chores.'

The interview was carried out at the couple's home in Uddingston just outside Glasgow.

The cameras showed Ms Sturgeon opening the door to Reid, making coffee and sitting in a conservatory to answer questions. 

Reid told her: 'We are in your lovely home now. It's like a show home. It's immaculate.'

Ms Sturgeon replied: 'That's because I had my husband up most of last night cleaning it. It's not always this tidy.'

In one recent interview David Cameron was seen preparing dinner, but the best Ms Sturgeon could do was make a coffee. 'I've never been very good in the kitchen,' she admitted.

'I like Indian takeaway,' she said, before joking: 'The fact we are on first names terms with the person who delivers it on a Friday night shouldn't allow you to read anything into my lifestyle.'

Reid also asked her about whether she had made a decision not to have children.

Ms Sturgeon said: 'People have started asking me, 'was it a conscious decision?' It hasn't been, it's just you know life takes certain directions and it doesn't take other directions and that's about as complicated as it gets.'

The former solicitor married Mr Murrell in 2010. Together with Alex Salmond and spin doctor Kevin Pringle, they were the four party chieftains who guided the party from multiple election defeats to the brink of breaking up the United Kingdom.

Ms Sturgeon has been a member of the Scottish Parliament since 1999. She put her name forward to become SNP leader in 2004, but stood aside when Mr Salmond threw his hat into the ring. She stood as his running mate and became deputy leader for a decade until Mr Salmond quit in the wake of the No vote in September's independence referendum.

Ms Sturgeon admitted that during her time in politics she had gained a reputation for being 'scary' with a tough persona. 

She said: 'Politics is a very male dominated, male driven profession. I was, not just a woman, but a young woman and I suppose you end up trying to behave in a way that you think is expected of you.'

'I am quite driven, I know what I think and I know what I want to achieve but I also hope that people who are asked to describe me, would describe me as pretty down-to-earth, loyal, friendly. The more experience I have got in politics I think the more I have allowed me to shine through.'

She refused to speculate how many seats the SNP will win on May 7, but suggested her party would perform better in a coalition than the Lib Dems.

'I'm not going to put a number on it, opinion polls don't win elections, hard work, persuasion, having the best policies and the best ideas for the country wins elections, so we'll try and win as many votes as we can and hope that translates into as many seats as possible.

'The Liberals in my view have got themselves into the position they are in just now which is facing political annihilation in a few weeks time, not because they went into coalition but because they went into coalition and immediately abandoned all of their principals.'
