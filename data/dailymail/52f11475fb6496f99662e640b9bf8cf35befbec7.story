Cheryl Burnside, 30, posed as a stripogram to gain entry to a block of flats in Halifax, West Yorkshire, before forcing a 71-year-old man to hand over money

A con artist who tricked her way into a vulnerable pensioner's home by posing as a stripogram before forcing him to hand over cash after stripping down to her bra and knickers has been jailed.

Cheryl Burnside, 30, conned her way into a block of flats in Halifax, West Yorkshire, by claiming to be a stripogram for a 'Mr Johnson'.

However, when she gained entry to the complex she persuaded a 71-year-old man to let her into his home so she could use the toilet.

Burnside, who was addicted to drink and drugs for several years, took off her dress as she told her victim that she had been booked as a stripogram for £70.

Prosecutor John Topham told Bradford Crown Court on Thursday that she was wearing only a bra and a thong when the man offered to give her £20 just to leave.

However, Burnside said she wanted more money and then pretended to make a phone call to her boyfriend suggesting that he should come to the flat because the man was refusing to pay up.

Before leaving the flat she grabbed a pair of trousers which contained a few pounds and the man's keys, but she was later linked to the crime after leaving her fingerprints on a cigarette packet.

The court heard that she committed the offence just days after being given a community sentence for shoplifting.

Mr Topham told the court how four months earlier Burnside had targeted another pensioner, in his 80s, who had previously helped her out with money.

She turned up at his Halifax home just after midnight and when he refused to give her any money she took his wallet with £60 in it.

The court heard that Burnside denied being involved in that offence in February and was on bail when she stole the second man's property in June.

Bradford Crown Court heard how it was the second time Burnside had targeted a pensioner for cash and the judge jailed her for three years for the 'despicable' crimes after she pleaded guilty to two charges of theft

She was originally charged with two offences of burglary, but when her case was listed for trial last month she pleaded guilty to two charges of theft.

Her guilty pleas spared the two pensioners from having to give evidence in court.

Judge Jonathan Rose described the crimes as 'despicable' and said Burnside had targeted her victims because of their age.

He jailed her for three years and imposed an indefinite restraining order banning her from contacting her first victim.
