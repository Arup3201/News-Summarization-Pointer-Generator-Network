Sunderland manager Gus Poyet was delighted by the performance of new £2.5million signing Will Buckley against Manchester United on Sunday.

The Black Cats drew 1-1 with Louis van Gaal's side at the Stadium of Light and Poyet was full of praise for a player he previously coached at Brighton before bringing him to the North East during the summer.

Buckley was a target for Poyet as soon as he took over the helm at Sunderland - even though the Uruguayan was not convinced the winger would ever make it as a Premier League footballer when he coached him on the south coast. 

Praise: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was impressed with Will Buckley's (right) display against Man United

Impressed: Poyet thought Buckley showed his direct ability as a winger against United at the Stadium of Light

Poyet said: 'When I first saw him, no. But he was learning, listening.

'He is very quiet, shy, but with his feet when he is on the pitch and he's got the chance to attack you, he's a nightmare.

'He is confident with the position that we play him, he knows what we want from him. When it's clear, it's supposed to be easy.

'He doesn't need to make too many decisions, apart from doing what he does best and being in position.'

Unexpected: Poyet did not think that Buckley would make it as a Premier League player when at Brighton

Sunderland retain an interest in Liverpool forward Fabio Borini.

They hope to tie up another loan deal for the Italian, similar to the one they agreed last season, but are unlikely to buy him for £14million.

Lille's ex-Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou is also a target.

Return: Sunderland want to bring Italian forward Fabio Borini back to the club on loan from Liverpool

Interest: Sunderland are looking into the possibility of signing Lille's ex-Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou
