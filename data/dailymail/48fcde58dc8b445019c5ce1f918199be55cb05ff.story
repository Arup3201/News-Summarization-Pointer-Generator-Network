An 11-year-old Boy Scout with Down syndrome has drowned in a canal near his home after trying to save his beloved dog.

C.J. Udall was reporting missing from his home in Mesa, Arizona around 9.30am on Saturday after relatives heard their dog Sapphire barking and ran to see him clawing his way out of a canal.

After retrieving the dog, they realized that C.J. was nowhere to be seen and alerted authorities.

Mesa police and Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies initiated a search on the air and ground near to the property at Ray and Power roads before focusing the search on the canal.

Loss: C.J. Udall, 11, drowned in a canal near his home after trying to save his family's dog from the water

Scene: The family found their dog crawling from this canal and four hours later, CJ's body was found there

Rescue divers with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office located the boy's body about four hours later not far from the location his dog was rescued, according to Lt. Ed Wessing.

Wessing says it appears the boy followed the family dog from the property, which borders the canal, and likely fell in.

His family, who are Mormons, told KPHO that C.J. knew the dangers of the canal and so they believe the only explanation is that he was trying to retrieve the dog from the water.

'We loved him more than life itself,' 
his mother Jori said through tears at a press conference. 'He was our 
hero. He battled through challenges with dignity.'

C.J., who had just been awarded his first
 Scout merit badge the night before he died, was a student at Gateway 
Point Elementary School, 'where he was a rock star and a chick magnet,' 
his mother said.

She recounted the events of the day, saying C.J. and his dog 'ventured off and slipped through a fence unnoticed'.

They found the dog but no sign of the boy.

'We didn't stop looking but soon realized that C.J.'s loyalty to his dog led him to try to save her,' she said.

Family members said the visitation will be held on Friday evening and a memorial will be held on Saturday at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Gilbert.

The family added in a statement that they
 'are heartbroken by the loss of our most amazing and talented son CJ 
Udall. His life ended too abruptly but we know that he has returned to 
his Heavenly Father and is with his grandpa and namesake, Carvel 
Jackson.'
