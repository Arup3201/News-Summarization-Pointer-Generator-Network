The parents of a 22-year-old psychology graduate who was found murdered in Chile traveled to the city of Temuco this week to transport their daughter's body back to the United States.

Chris Hagan and his grief-stricken wife were photographed Wednesday in Chile on their way to make final arrangements for Erica Faith Hagan, according to Soy Chile.

The Kentucky woman was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco Saturday morning.

Parents' worst nightmare: Bambi and Chris Hagan are pictured in Chile, where they arrived this week to transport their daughter's body back to the US 

She was working as an English teacher at a secondary school in Temuco, located 450 miles south of the capital of Santiago.

On Tuesday, local authorities announced that they are investigating three potential suspects in connection to Hagan's slaying. They have not been named. 

Roberto Garrido, a spokesperson for the Public Ministry of Chile, told the press the investigation into the killing has revealed that Ms Hagan likely knew the killer or killers and opened the door for them because officers found no signs of forced entry in her apartment, reported Soy Chile.

Hagan's wounds were said to have been caused by a blunt object. AFP reported there were traces of a fire at the unit.

Two separate online fundraisers have been set up to help Erica's parents with her final expenses, including the cost of transporting her remains back to the US.

Well-educated: Hagan, 22, graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year

Bright future: Hagan obtained a degree in psychology with a minor in Spanish 

A friend of Erica Hagan’s has launched a GoFundMe account hoping to collect $100,000, which would go toward a memorial scholarship to 'help carry on her legacy.’

Erica's older sister, Kimberly, also set up a fundraiser Monday, which has since reached - and surpassed - its goal of collecting $5,000 towards the 22-year-old's funeral expenses.

‘Its [sic] very obvious she was loved by many, she will be greatly missed and never forgotten,’ the bereaved Ms Underhill wrote.

Kimberly Underhill also revealed that an FBI agent has been sent to Chile to help with the investigation into her sister’s murder. 

Miss Hagan graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year with a degree in psychology and a minor in Spanish.

In July, she traveled to Chile after accepting a six-month job as a teaching assistant in English.

She had visited Chile previously and was scheduled to return home in December.  

'This was a phenomenal, well-loved young lady that deserved better,' said Hagan's aunt, Charlene Martin.

Killed by friends? Officials in Chile revealed that Hagan likely knew her killers because her apartment showed no signs of a forced entry

Erica had been documenting her experiences of living and working abroad in her blog 'Donde en el Mundo?' (Where in the world?)

Her last entry went up September 5, just two days before her violent death. In her lengthy post, Hagan discussed some instances of culture shock she had experienced in her encounters with the locals. 

Along with anecdotes about cultural differences between Chileans and Americans, Hagan gushed about the friendliness of the local people.

'God has blessed me with many people that care how I spend my time and don't want me to be lonely while I'm here,' she wrote. 

'Everyday I meet more people that invite me to be social with them and I love it! The hardest part is for me to take them up on it by asking them to keep me company during my free time. 

'Ironic I know, but I still have that southern upbringing that taught me that it's rude to invite yourself to places. In due time I guess...'

Temuco is one of the country's largest cities and located near the southern boarder.

A memorial service will be held this week at Georgetown College.

Hagan was set to return home in December and continue her education by entering a graduate school
