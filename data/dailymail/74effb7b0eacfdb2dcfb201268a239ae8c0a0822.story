A jewellery company has used 3D printing to create personalised Pez dispensers - allowing owners to get sweets from inside their own head.

Popular in the U.S. but originally from Austria, Pez candy is well known for the mechanical dispensers it comes packaged in which are topped with the heads of pop culture icons.

Pulling back the head at the top of the packet dispenses a sweet, which appears to emerge from mouth or beneath the chin of the character featured.

Is there nothing you can't print? A Canadian firm has used theirs to create personalised Pez dispensers

The personalised Pez dispenser hack was the work of Canadian firm Hot Pop Factory, who had been asked to come up with a unique and innovative Christmas gift for one of their client's employees.

Specialists in 3D printing, Toronto-based Hot Pop Factory generally focus on designing low-cost jewellery with elaborate, geometric designs.

But the versatility of their equipment meant they were able to use it to remix the iconic Pez sweet dispensers with 3D scanned doubles of the workers' heads.

Cannibalised: Once the heads were 3D printed, the makers exchanged them with the heads on retail Pez packs

Using an Xbox Kinect controller, they took a 3D scan of each of the people they were making the products for, pretending to carry out a mysterious 'research' project so as not to give the game away.

They then used computer aided design software to clean up the scans and add the fitting for the Pez dispenser, before feeding the files to their Makerbot Replicator 3D printer.

Finally, they cannibalised a bunch of retail Pez packs, pulling off the Disney princess heads and replacing them with their unique, personalised ones.

They were a hit. 'We could not have imagined a better reaction! Big smiles and laughs all around,' said a post on the company blog.
