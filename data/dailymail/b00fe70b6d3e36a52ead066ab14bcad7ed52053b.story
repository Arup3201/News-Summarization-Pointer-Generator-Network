Manchester United playmaker Angel di Maria failed to live up to his £60million price-tag once again on Wednesday night with his main flaw surrounding his inability to pick out a red shirt.

Di Maria, who looked incredibly disappointed after being hauled off in the 59th minute, was Manchester United's worst passer with a passing accuracy percentage of 63.6 per cent.

Louis van Gaal's decision to replace the Premier League's record signing with Adnan Januzaj comes just days after Di Maria was hooked off at the interval against Sunderland following another below-par performance against Gus Poyet's side.

Marcos Rojo - 87.8 

Antonio Valencia - 96.9 

Jonny Evans - 88.9

Chris Smalling - 88.5

Angel di Maria - 63.6 

Daley Blind - 89.2 

Ander Herrera - 90.7 

Ashley Young - 79.3

Marouane Fellaini - 83.3

Wayne Rooney  - 90.3

Adnan Januzaj - 66.7 (came on in 59th minute)

Juan Mata - 100 (came on in 82nd minute)

Di Maria's passing accuracy in the opposing half was even worse with the Argentina international completing just 54.5 per cent of his passes.

Januzaj, who came off the substitutes' bench to replace Di Maria, also seemed to be on a different wavelength to his Manchester United team-mates as his passing accuracy percentage was just 66.7 during the 31 minutes he was on the field of play.

The likes of Ander Herrera (90.7 per cent), Wayne Rooney (90.3 per cent) and late substitute Juan Mata (100 per cent) all impressed on the ball during their side's slender 1-0 win over Newcastle.

Van Gaal, who said Di Maria needs a year to adapt to life in the Barclays Premier League, will be hoping his record summer signing can replicate the form he had shown in his last few months at Real Madrid.
