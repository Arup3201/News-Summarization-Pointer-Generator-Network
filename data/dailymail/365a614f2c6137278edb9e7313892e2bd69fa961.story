Two drug dealers were convicted of masterminding a £6million money laundering and drug ring after police found a number saved in their driver's phone for 'Mr Boss Man'.

Rodney Stacey, 37, and Patrick Goodman, 64, were said to be the brains behind an extensive trans-European drugs network smuggling cocaine and amphetamines into the UK from the continent.

Police were first alerted in February 2011 when a lorry entering the UK at the Port of Dover, Kent, was stopped and searched by UK Borders Agency officers.

Officers found a holdall with a GPS tracking device containing 16 kilos of cocaine concealed behind the cab of the vehicle - with an estimated street value of £2.3million.

The driver was then arrested and interviewed and denied all knowledge of the drugs.

But when police checked his mobile phone they discovered a number for 'Mr Boss Man' which led them straight to Stacey, from Folkestone, Kent.

A month later another drug-runner was stopped by French authorities attempting to smuggle around 80 kilos of amphetamine between France and Belgium.

A holdall stuffed with £1.5 million of cocaine was found in a BMW and the drug barons' schemes were discovered by police

This is the stash of money found on Stacey

Canterbury Crown Court heard on 
yesterday that Goodman, from Paddock Wood, Kent was also spotted over 
several months meeting Stacey when cash or drugs were exchanged.

On
 December 12 2011, one member of the group was arrested after officers 
found £152,000 worth of ecstasy tablets disguised as coffee in a van 
following a meeting with Goodman.

Stacey was arrested after trying to flee from cops but was arrested when drugs were found in his BMW.

A further stash was later found stored in a freezer at his home.

Goodman was arrested on July 24 at his home and later charged with offences of conspiracy to supply controlled drugs and money laundering.

Stacey was charged with conspiracy to supply controlled drugs and money laundering.

Speaking after Goodman and Stacey's conviction, DC David Friend from the Kent and Essex Serious Organised Crime Unit said: 'Stacey and Goodman were the masterminds behind this extensive drugs and money laundering operation.

'Both of them worked hard at organising how they would smuggle their drugs into the country and how they would be distributed across Kent.

'These convictions have put two major players in the illegal drugs industry out of the game and serve as a warning to others that crime does not pay.'

Both were found guilty at Canterbury Crown Court and will be sentenced later this week.
