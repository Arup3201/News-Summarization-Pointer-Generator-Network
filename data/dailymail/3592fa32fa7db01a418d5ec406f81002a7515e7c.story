A British woman is fighting to save a South American rainforest from an oil company after marrying the leader of the local tribe.

Mari Muench, a mother-of-one from south London, met Patricio Jipa, a Kichwa tribe shaman, during a trip to Ecuador in 2008 where he wooed her with a poisonous frog.

The couple immediately felt they were 'destined' to be together and settled down in his ancestral home where they now run an eco-tourism lodge.

But the rainforest is under threat from 
PetroAmazonas, Ecuador’s state-owned oil company, which recently offered
£400,000 for access to the 170 acres of land.

Ms Muench and her husband are two of 400 members of the Kichwa tribe living on the banks of Ecuador’s Napo River, where the 49-year-old and 
her husband married in 2010.

Ms Muench, who used to run a go-kart 
circuit in Greenwich, has 18-month-old daughter Samai by Patricio and 
wore a dress made out of tree bark for her wedding.

Despite their ecotourism project 
currently relying on Ms Muench's life-savings, the pair are heading a 
campaign to save Mr Jipa's ancestral territory, travelling by canoe from home to home to try and convince the members of their community to turn down the offer.

In exchange for access to the land, PetroAmazonas has 
promised the community a new school, grant funding 
for their children to go to university, healthcare, jobs and lump sums of cash, a lucrative deal for the struggling tribe.

Save the forest: The community runs an eco-tourism lodge in the rainforest, but as it currently fails to make a profit the tribe may not have a choice but to sell to the oil company

Trying to convince the community to turn away from these promises is no mean feat, Mr Jipa wrote in The Guardian last year, especially with the current financial state of the Sani Isla lodge, but the pair are determined to save the forest.

In a heart-wrenching first-person piece, Mr Jipa wrote: 'We have protected these lands with our hearts, soul and lives since before we can remember.

'The modern world is advancing faster 
than we as a people can cope with, but we know that education is key and
there is a need for money too. Life has changed. Even in the rainforest
we now need money for schooling and to sustain ourselves to start 
projects such as an organic fruit farm.

'The oil companies have made great 
in-roads this time, they have found our people at an all-time low 
emotionally and financially, and have seized their chance. How can we 
help the community give up such wonderful opportunities?'

But he goes on to say that he and his wife will continue to fight to save the community and encourage them to find other means of sustaining themselves.

‘By supporting themselves through ecotourism the Sani Isla Kichwa community have thus far been able to fight off the constant pressure from oil company representatives to give in to the financial temptation that comes with the billions of dollars’ worth of oil that their land contains,' Ms Muench wrote on the Sani Isla website.

‘The knock on effect of allowing the oil companies in would be catastrophic for both the people of Sani and the rest of the world, but they are running out of time and options.'

Times of change: The community by the Napo River has been struggling to survive in recent years after hundreds of years of being self-sustaining
