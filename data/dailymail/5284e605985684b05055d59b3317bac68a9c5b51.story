The stepfather of an Idonesian girl who worked herself to death has defended the advertising industry saying that 'long hours are expected.'

Zafrul Sjahrial, who has had a 35-year career in advertising, said that Pradnya Paramita was entering a 'high note' of her career adding that she knew what it took to succeed.

Paramita collapsed on Saturday while out with friends following the mammoth shift, slipped into a coma, and died on Sunday.

Zafrul Sjahrial, the stepfather of Pradnya Paramita who died after a 30 hour shift, has defended the advertising industry saying Paramita knew what it took to succeed

Speaking to the South China Morning Post following her funeral, Sjahrial said: 'Life
 in advertising is not like working in a bank or any other institution.

'The long hours are expected and already a prerequisite. I know how the industry works. Other industries are doing worse than this.'

He also dismissed the claims that she had worked 30 hours solid as 'overblown', adding: 'There must be lunch breaks and dinner breaks, there must have been walks around the office.

'For a young lady – for 30 hours – she wouldn’t want to stay in the same clothes the whole day.'

He also confirmed that the family would not be taking any action against her employer, Young & Rubicam, as they just wanted their daughter to rest in peace.

Y&R are an advertising firm with headquarters in New York, 6,500 employees across the world and clients including Dell, Colgate, Xerox and Citibank.

Paramita, who went under the name Mita Diran on Twitter, frequently posted about her long hours online and collapsed while having dinner with friends just hours after this message

Paramita worked for advertising agency Young & Rubicam whose clients include Dell and Xerox

The copy writer slipped into a coma late on Saturday night and was pronounced dead on Sunday

Sjahrial said her tweets showed she was passionate about her job and was 'a girl ready for the next step'

Paramita, who went under the name Mita Diran on Twitter, often messaged about her long hours, and at 7pm on Saturday, shortly before she collapsed, said: '30 hours of working and still going strooong.'

Speaking about the message Sjahrial said: 'She’s so enthusiastic and passionate. That tweet is by a girl ready for the next step.

'My daughter was strong. I know she knows what it takes to be in the advertising industry.'

He described the 27-year-old as passionate, a keen reader, and strong headed. Weeks before her death Paramita had earned awards for her work.

Sjahrial, an advertising creative director with 35 years' experience, said long hours were expected

The Thai version of Red Bull has been blamed for contributing to the death, and Sjahrial says Paramita had used it to stay awake since University, but stressed that the company had not asked her to drink it

Sjahrial confirmed that he would not be pressing charges against the company saying that if people wanted somebody to blame, they should blame the entire industry

Addressing claims that Thai Red Bull could have contributed to her death, he said she had used the drink to stay awake since going to University, and stressed that the company had not asked her to do so.

He added that people looking for somebody to blame should blame the entire industry, not just one company.

Y&R are investigating the death internally and closed their Jakarta office for the day on Monday as a mark of respect.

Stepfather also said reports of continuous 30-hour shift were 'overblown' saying there must have been breaks for food or opportunities to walk around the office

In a Facebook post about the death Y&R expressed sympathy with the family, before telling other employees: ‘Please people. Know your own body limitation, don’t push yourself too hard.’

Meanwhile a state lawmaker has called for an independent inquiry and said the company may be taken to court if it was proved Paramita worked excessive hours.

This case echoes that of German-born Merrill Lynch intern Moritz Erhardt, who was found dead in the shower of his London flat after a non-stop 72-hour shift

An inquest found he died of an epileptic seizure which could have been brought on by tiredness. Merrill Lynch was a one-time client of Y&R in the '80s.
