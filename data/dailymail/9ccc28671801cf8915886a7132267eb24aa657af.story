AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin has denied speculation he was texting or speeding while driving his girlfriend's SUV into four parked cars last night.

The Sydney Swans player told reporters at a press conference this morning the incident was just 'an accident' and he was grateful no one was hurt.

'I just didn't see the cars parked on the left,' he said. 'It was just an accident, accidents happen.'

Busted: Sydney Swans AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin was fined $405 after smashing into four parked cars last night

On Wednesday night, the Sydney Swans released a statement in relation to their $10 million star recruit's crash.

'Franklin was the only person involved in the accident. He was not carrying any passengers and there were no passengers in any of the other vehicles involved. No one was injured in the accident,' the statement read.

The 27-year-old said after training at the SCG this morning he was upset about the crash.

'I'm devastated but so thankful that no one else was in the car,' he said.

'I was in shock at first. Anyone in a car accident has that reaction, so yeah a bit shocked and a bit shaky too.

'Obviously I'm frustrated, at myself...I don't want to see myself in the spotlight, I just want to move forward as quickly as possible and focus on our game this weekend.'

He was also 'deeply sorry' about the inconvenience caused to the owners of the parked cars.

'I haven't had a chance to speak with them but...I am truly sorry,' he said.

Car crash: The AFL player was driving the Jeep SUV he shares with girlfriend Jesinta Campbell when he collided with four parked cars in Rose Bay, Sydney, on Wednesday night 

Serious damage: The impact of the crash caused airbags on the vehicle to deploy

The forward told Sunrise on Thursday morning he was 'a little bit upset' about what happened - but wasn't able to shed any light on why he collided with the parked vehicles.

'Obviously I'm a little bit upset about what happened last night...I'm just lucky no one was injured, and myself wasn't injured, so to come out of it unscathed, I'm happy with that,' he said.

The boyfriend of Jesinta Campbell was allegedly driving along New South Head Road in Rose Bay, Sydney, when the incident occurred around 7.30pm.

Franklin admitted that he was driving too close to the parked cars when the accident occurred.

'I got a little bit too close to the car parked in lane one and that was pretty much it,' he said.

'Then the airbags went off and that's all I can say about it.'

Police have confirmed the footballer has since been issued a $405 traffic infringement notice for negligent driving and docked three demerit points. He will not be charged over the matter.

The 27-year-old was driving a black Jeep SUV that belongs to his model and TV presenter partner, the same vehicle they were caught parking in a disabled spot in back in January.

A New South Wales police spokesman said that people were alerted to the incident after 'residents reported hearing a car crash'.

'Inquires are continuing after a car hit a number of parked vehicles in Rose Bay tonight,' he told AFL.com.au.

'A Jeep that was travelling west on New South Head road hit four parked vehicles, all four vehicles were damaged as a result of the crash.

'The driver of the Jeep was a 27-year-old Bondi man and he was not injured in the crash.

'He underwent a roadside breath test that was negative.

'After speaking with police at the scene the 27-year-old man left the area.'

Towed away: The car was unable to drive from the scene and Franklin gave a statement to police at the site

A male witness who first responded to the crash told MailOnline Franklin 'collected' four parked cars on New South Head road and 'totalled' the jeep he was driving in.

'It was half up on the gutter, half on the road and facing in toward the footpath,' he said.

'It's gone.'

The collision caused the airbags of the jeep Franklin was driving in to deploy. They said Franklin was traveling alone and did not appear intoxicated.

'He wasn't drunk or anything, he was fine. He was giving police a statement and then he left eastbound.'

'Just totalled': Rose Bay resident Craig McDonald was on the scene and saw the wreckage first hand

Rose Bay resident Craig McDonald was on the scene and tweeted photos of accident, including images of the damaged Jeep and other vehicles involved.

'Buddy Franklin has just totalled three cars on New South Head road outside my place,' he posted on the social media site.

Police attended the scene and were seen speaking to Franklin shortly before his vehicle was towed away.

Franklin was last seen leaving the crash site in a black Audi sedan with two females inside, and is expected at a team training session in the morning.

Karla Leach, director of corporate affairs for Fiat Chrysler Australia, told the MailOnline her company was in 'constant' discussions with Jesinta Campbell's management about arranging the TV star a new vehicle.

'At this stage we are obviously assessing the car and understanding the extent of the damage,' she said.

'We have been talking with Jesinta's management all day and a decision about a replacement vehicle will be made in the next week.'

She said the company needed to determine if the car was a write-off before Jesinta can be given a new Jeep.

'We're just relieved nobody was seriously injured,' she said.

'They don't need to be dealing with this and the damage control tomorrow.'
