Heirs to the literary rights of author Arthur Conan Doyle have filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to stop the publication of a book based on his two most famous creations: Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.

A book of stories based on the characters, by a group of contemporary writers, is due out later this year, but Doyle's estate is insisting that the book’s publisher must pay for a license to use the characters.

Doyle 
wrote four novels and 56 short stories about the London-based sleuth 
which were published in the U.S. between 1887 and 1927.

U.S.
 copyright protection for the novels and the first 46 stories has lapsed
 and they are now in the public domain, but the final ten stories remain
 under copyright.

The man behind the new book is Leslie Klinger. In 2011 he published a similar volume of re-imagined stories, A Study In Sherlock, and paid a $5,000 licensing fee even though he didn’t believe that he needed to.

For his latest volume, In The Company Of Sherlock Holmes, Klinger doesn’t believe he should pay and last month a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled in his favor, sparking the latest court action.

‘When a story falls into the public domain, story elements - including characters covered by the expired copyright - become fair game for follow-on authors,’ wrote Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

Klinger argues that the essential characteristics of Holmes and Watson were established in the works already in the public domain. Therefore, he says, he and his team are free to write new works based on them.

But Doyle's estate insists that the characters continued to develop throughout the course of all the Holmes works and are seeking further copyright protection, reports NBC News.

'Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson were not static but are dynamic literary characters who changed and developed throughout the Sherlock Holmes canon,' Doyle's heirs are arguing before the U.S. high court.

'Many aspects of these characters' natures are not revealed until the final 10 stories, which are still under copyright protection,' says the estate.

It has asked the high court to delay enforcement of the appeals court ruling, at least temporarily, until its legal team could prepare a more detailed petition for the Supreme Court to hear their case.

Klinger has dismissed the appeal to the Supreme Court.

'The 7th Circuit [federal appeals court] ruled on June 22 in our favor, finding that creators were free to use the characters of Holmes, Watson, etc., so long as the creators did not infringe on the "protected elements" in the remaining 10 copyrighted stories,' he wrote on his blog.

'Clearly, the characters' names and most of their characteristics are not such "protected elements." Thus, to put it very loosely, Sherlock Holmes is "free.'"

His book is scheduled to be published in November.
