A suicide bomber this morning rammed a small sedan into a mini-bus carrying foreign aviation workers to Kabul airport, killing 12 people.

The bomber has been named by Afghan insurgents as Fatima, 22, who was reportedly wearing a suicide vest and blew herself up on a large avenue northwest of the city centre near the airport.

Islamist group Hezb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the attack, with spokesman Haroon Zarghoon saying it was launched in retaliation for a film mocking the Prophet Mohammad.

Horrific sight: Bodies were seen lying by the mangled mini-van, which was thrown at least 50 metres

The criminal director for the Kabul 
police department, Mohammad Zahir, said eight South Africans believed to be foreign
aviation company workers died in the 
blast and ten Afghan bystanders were wounded.

The other person killed was believed to be Afghan - possibly a driver or translator for the group.

The explosion, which went off in front of a petrol station, was so powerful it hurled the mini-bus about 50 metres (46 yards).

Reports from the scene said at least six
 bodies lay next to the destroyed mini-van.

Eight Afghan workers were also said to have been injured in the blast.

Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi confirmed the death toll and said tests were being carried out to determine if the suicide bomber was a woman.

An eyewitness at the scene said he was waiting for a bus to go to work at 6.45am when he saw a small white sedan ram into the mini-bus.

'The explosion was so powerful and loud that I could not hear anything for ten minutes,' said Abdullah Shah, a teacher waiting at a bus stop. 'It was early and there wasn't much traffic.'

The bombing came a day after hundreds of Afghans burned cars and threw rocks at a U.S. military base in the capital in a demonstration against the anti-Islam film.

One police vehicle was burned by the mob before they finally dispersed around midday yesterday.

Hizb-i-Islami is led by former warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The group has recently sought to participate in a so-far fruitless peace and reconciliation effort led by President Hamid Karzai.

As part of the group's effort, it offered a peace plan that called for a broad-based government. Hizb-i-Islami is a radical Islamist militia that has thousands of fighters and followers across the north and east of Afghanistan.

Its 65-year-old leader is a former Afghan prime minister and one-time U.S. ally who is now listed as a terrorist by Washington.

Devastating: The incident was the first reported suicide car bombing ever to be carried out by a woman in Afghanistan

The Taliban have also threatened to increase their attacks against foreign targets to avenge the controversial film.

Taliban fighters last week attacked a large British base in southern Afghanistan, killed two U.S. Marines and destroyed six fighter jets. Nato forces killed 14 insurgents and captured another who participated in the attack.

In a torrent of violence blamed on the 
film last week, the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans 
were killed in an attack in Benghazi.

Shocking violence: The bomber was driving a Sedan and blew it up beside a minivan carrying foreigners on a major highway leading to Kabul's international airport

Widespread anger: Afghan police arrive at the scene of the attack, which was apparently launched in retaliation for a film mocking the Prophet Mohammad

U.S. and other foreign 
embassies were stormed in cities in Asia, Africa and the Middle East by 
furious Muslims. At least nine other people were killed.

The news will raise fears that anger 
over the film will feed into deteriorating security as the U.S. and other 
Western countries try to protect their forces from a rash of so-called 
insider attacks by Afghan colleagues.

The U.S. has sent ships, extra troops and special forces to protect U.S. interests and citizens in the Middle East, while a number of its embassies have evacuated staff and are on high alert for trouble.

Despite Obama's efforts early in his tenure to improve relations with the Arab and Muslim world, the violence adds to a host of problems including the continued US military involvement in Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the Syrian civil war and the fall-out from the Arab Spring revolts.
