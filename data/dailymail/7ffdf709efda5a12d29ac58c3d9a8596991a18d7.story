Think you're too busy to work out? Perhaps this video will change your mind, as two of the busiest and most important men in the world go for a jog round the White House.

A video has emerged of President Barack Obama and Joe Biden, his vice-president taking a quick run around the White House, in support of Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move' campaign designed to encourage people to get physically healthier and make changes in diet.

The fourth anniversary of the campaign kicked off on 'The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon', with Michelle dancing with giant anthropomorphic vegetables.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Time for a jog: Obama and Biden begin their run in the office, running down the long White House corridors

They pass their somewhat bemused White House staff and guards, gaining speed as they head round the corners

The first lady promised viewers of the show that if they Tweeted, Instagramed and facebooked the event enough, then the President and Vice President would 'show us how they move'.

True to her word, a video was posted on the Let's Move site today titled 'The moment you've been waiting for' featuring both the leaders taking some brief exercise.

The video begins with Joe Biden entering the Presidential office asking 'are you ready?'.

The pair pass the presidential pets, the Portuguese water dogs Bo and Sunny, who look on in amazement

Picking up speed: The duo head outside to start a real sprint, and the proper exercise begins

Follow the leader: Biden lags behind his Commander-in-Chief

The President replies 'Let's do this',
 and the two begin a run around the White House, followed by stretching 
and drinking a large glass of water each.

They then promise each other 'same time next week' before heading back to work.

As Biden catches up, the two begin a more leisurely pace, more jogging than running full clip

Warm down: The pair stretch, so that they can avoid cramps and muscle aches later in the day

You win: Biden concedes that Obama had him pegged during their mid afternoon run

Time to hydrate: The two stress the importance of refuelling after exercise with some conveniently placed presidential glasses

President Obama promises to tell the Vice President's wife that he drank all of the water, so he doesn't get in trouble

Back to work: President Obama, satisfied with his day's workout, heads back to important democratic business in his White House office

The
 Let's Move campaign was started in 2010 by First lady Michelle Obama, 
as a campaign to fight childhood and adult obesity, as well as improve 
the general health of the U.S. population.

The scheme focuses on plans of diet and exercise, promoting healthy eating and regular physical activity.

It
 also provides step-by-step plans for those aiming to join in with the 
campaign, and regularly enlists the help of celebrities.

The First lady's scheme has been running for four years, and celebrated it's fourth anniversary on a popular national talk show

Recently
 Michelle Obama joined up with actor and comedian Will Ferrel to get 
fans to learn the facts about obesity and how they can fight it.

The scheme is part of a White House initiative on fighting the condition, hoping to 'bring the U.S. to a much more healthier norm'.

The appearance of Mr Biden and Mr Obama in the video together is another suggestion that their relationship is back on track.

In a revealing interview with Politico, Mr Biden, 71, said his boss assigned him 'every s*** job in the world' and was effectively frozen out after announcing his approval of gay marriage before the President.

‘When the president asked me what portfolio did I want, I said, “Base it on what you want of me to help you govern…But I want to be the last guy in the room on every major decision… You’re president, I’m not, but if it’s my experience you’re lookin’ for, I want to be the last guy to make the case,”’ Biden said in a lengthy Politico profile.He went on to admit that Obama kept up his end of the bargain for the majority of their dealings, but the article reveals that there has been a definite frost between the two men that has only just begun to thaw now after the 2012 incident.
