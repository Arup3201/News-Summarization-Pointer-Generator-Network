As the sun begins to shine, thoughts turn to holidays, swimwear and bikini bodies and it seems that Ferne McCann is already one step ahead of the game.

The TOWIE star, 23, has been unveiled as the face - and incredibly toned body - of By Caprice's swimwear collection.

Ferne replaced best friend Lucy Mecklenburgh as the face of By Caprice's Valentine's lingerie range earlier this year and it seems that the CEO loved her so much, she's enlisted her again.

Ferne showcases the new range - which is awash with bright summery colours and classic tones - to perfection.

The range, which incorporates an array of bikinis, monokinis and swimsuits in nautical stripes and tropical prints, has been designed to flatter all figures.

Feeling good: TOWIE star Ferne says she feels 'sexy and feminine' in each and every one of the designs

CEO and designer Caprice said: 'Ferne has the ultimate bikini body and her natural beauty shines 
through the swimwear that will give every girl confidence.

'We are delighted to have Ferne as our brand ambassador for swimwear - sheâ€™s fun, young and stylish.'

Ferne added: 'I am thrilled and honoured Caprice chose me to 
represent her brand. It is beautifully designed and I felt 
feminine and sexy in every piece.

'This swimwear collection has something
 for everyone and not only gives you perfect shape the designs are so 
comfortable.' 

Svelte: Ferne replaces friend and former co-star Lucy Mecklenburgh as the face of the range and says she is often inspired by her fellow TOWIE star's exercise regimes

Ferne recently confessed in Closer 
magazine that she 'loves posing in underwear' and revealed she works 
hard for those curves - and is inspired by her TOWIE co-stars.

'It's
 hard not to get motivated when you look at Lucy Mecklenburgh's body, 
but I've had to put in more work than her,' she told the magazine.

'Lucy
 is naturally skinny - she had a head start. There's no doubt she's 
worked hard, but bigger girls have to work harder. I've got curves and a
 big bum - I'm completely different to Lucy.'

Ferne
 confessed too that she exercises five times a week - three times with a
 personal trainer, once with a friend and a running session with her 
mother.

As a result of the exercise and sensible eating, she says she 
now feels 'sexy' and judging by her new shoot, she's certainly keen to prove it.
