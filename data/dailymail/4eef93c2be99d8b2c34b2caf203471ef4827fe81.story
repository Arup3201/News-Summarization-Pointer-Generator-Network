A wealth of artwork, furnishings and jewelry owned by the late Listerine heiress Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon netted a total of $218.1 million following a five-day auction in New York this week.

All up there were 1,521 objects  owned by Mellon - who died in March at the age of 103 - and 98 percent of the lots sold after going under the hammer at Sotheby's.

Some 43 post-war and contemporary paintings by artists including Pablo Picasso, Georges Seurat and Edward Hopper were among the collection.

However the highlight was a pear-shaped blue diamond weighing 9.75 carats that sold for $32.6 million, an auction record for a blue diamond, according to Bloomberg.

The previous auction record was $24.3 million, set at Christie’s in in December 2008. 

The furnishings, including an 18th century porcelain dinner service that sold for $293,000, were from Mellon’s homes in the U.S., Europe and the Caribbean.

The star art items proved to be two paintings by American abstract impressionist Mark Rothko, which made a combined $76.4 million. 

Untitled (Yellow, Orange, Yellow, Light Orange), from 1955, sold for $36.5 million, just over its pre-sale estimate high of $30 million. 

Meanwhile, Untitled - a dark blue expanse created 15 years later - brought in just under $40 million, almost double its top pre-sale estimate.

At least two wall hangings brought in nearly quadruple their pre-auction estimates.

Bouquet de Fleurs by the French impressionist painter Eva Gonzalez sold for $1.56 million and Le Saladier by the Russian master Nicolas de Stael netted $2.04 million.

Classic: This piece by Camille Pissarro went for $2.461 million

Eight paintings by the late American painter Richard Diebenkorn sold for a combined $32.2 million at the November 10 auction. 

At the other end of the scale, one bidder picked up a 1901 beach scene by Pablo Picasso for $700,000 - roughly half its estimated value.

'The bidding was big, was broad, was frantic,' Sotheby's auctioneer Oliver Barker said shortly after  dropping the final hammer.

'We saw bidding from literally all over the world . . . We are absolutely delighted.'

It was anticipated that the slice of Mellon's artwork would bring in a high of $121 million but eager collectors pushed that figure through the roof.

Vast collection: Eight paintings by American painter Richard Diebenkorn - including this one - sold for a combined $32.2 million

Collectible: The piece from Edward Hopper sold for $1.08 million

Exceeding expectation: This oil on canvas titled Paysage Bord de Mere by Russian painter Nicolas de Staël smashed its pre-sale estimate of $100,000 to $150,000 with a final selling price of $425,000

Other items from the Mellon collection, including jewelry and furnishings, were offered in a series of sales from November 20 to 23.

Proceeds will benefit The Gerard B. Lambert Foundation, which supports The Oak Spring Garden Library in Upperville, Virginia. 

The library houses Mellon's collection of rare books, manuscripts and works of art related to landscape design, horticulture and natural history.

Mellon, a noted horticulturist and widow of philanthropist Paul Mellon, died in March at age 103 at her Virginia estate following a 15-year battle with stomach cancer.

Well-connected: Here Mellon is pictured with Jacqueline Kennedy in 1961. The two women became firm friends and Mellon, a self-taught horticulturist, designed the White House Rose Garden

Mellon's grandfather Jordan W. Lambert created Listerine, and her father, Gerald Lambert, built a company that made everything from Dentyne to Schick razors. 

Paul Mellon had his own fortune, inherited from his Pittsburgh industrialist father and built on holdings in banking, coal, railroads, steel and aluminum.

Bunny Mellon was a self-taught botanist and close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 

In 1961 she redesigned the White House Rose Garden, and later she created another White House garden that was named for Kennedy after her death.

The Mellons donated hundreds of important artworks to museums, including the National Gallery of Art, founded in 1937 by Paul Mellon's father, Andrew Mellon.
