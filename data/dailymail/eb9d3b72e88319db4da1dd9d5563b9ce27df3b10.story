A Colorado couple are being blamed for the death of their 2-year-old son, after the toddler died in a house fire.

During the course of their investigation, authorities discovered that 27-year-old Julia Welton and her husband Christopher Welton, 33, encouraged their son Levi to smoke.

The boy and his older brother Dean, 5, tested positive for THC two times before the house fire broke out at their home in Sterling in mid-January.

Arrested: Julia Welton, 27 (left), and Christopher Welton, 33 (right), were indicted Tuesday on child negligence charges

Mystery: It's uncertain what caused a fire to break out at the Welton's home in January, but a lighter was found in the room where Levi was left unattended

Firefighters found Levi unconscious in a closet of the bedroom where the fire broke out. The toddler was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Though the cause of the fire is still under investigation, authorities say they found a lighter in the room where Levi and his brother were left unattended.

A Colorado grand jury indicted the Weltons on charges of negligent child abuse resulting in death, negligent child abuse - no injury and three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a child.

The couple were arrested and booked at Logan County Jail where they are being held on $100,000 bail.

Local child services authorities had been investigating the couple, according to documents obtained by 7 News.

The Logan County Department of Human Services tested Levi and Dean for THC in November 2013 and both boys tested positive to the drug found in marijuana.

From there, the department filed a Dependency and Neglect Motion in court, which cited a lack of supervision, drug use and inappropriate people visiting the home.

And marijuana wasn't the only drug use going on in the home.

During one home visit, 'little white pills' were found on the floor and 'in Levi Welton's hand'.

Caseworkers deemed the home a fire hazard during the house visit as well, since Julia Welton was observed ashing her cigarette on the carpet - something she didn't realize she was doing until a caseworker pointed it out. A cigarette butt was also found on the floor.

Parents: The Weltons are also facing three counts of contributing tot he delinquency of a child

The children were temporarily taken out of the home, but eventually returned.

The second time they tested positive for THC was just hours before the fire broke out and Levi was killed.

According to authorities, the two boys had been left without parental supervision in one of the home's bedrooms while their parents smoked weed with friends in another room.

Though the cause of the fire is still unknown, it seemed to originate in a pile of clothing and blankets underneath the window where the boys were found.

Despite the report saying the Welton boys tested positive for THC, father Chris told Fox 31 he never let his kids smoke the drug.

Mother Julia reportedly holds a medical marijuana card for a painful condition, but her husband was also tested positive for THC.

He says he's now lost his job as a plumber due to the negative publicity.

Wife Julia says they've received death threats as well, which is causing a strain on their mourning.

'All of these rumors about us killing our son need to quit. And I'm tired of hearing them. I want to mourn about my son without all the rumors,' she told Fox 31.
