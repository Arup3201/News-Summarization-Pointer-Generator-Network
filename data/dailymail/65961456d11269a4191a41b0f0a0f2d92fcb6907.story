A pair of German DJs have had saline injected into their chests in a bid to discover what life as a woman is really like. 

John and Rasheed, who are famous in Germany for their strange stunts, had 700ml of saline injected into their chests to create breasts that would last 24 hours.

The pair, who work for Jam FM, visited surgeon Mark Wolter, in Germany, for the temporary boob job that took an hour to complete.

As he prepared for the procedure Rasheed said: 'Mum, I'm sorry', while John brought his wife with him for moral support and to supply him with bikinis.

Despite the dangers of bruising and inflammation the pair remained undeterred as both men opted for a C cup and even managed to joke around on the 'operating' table.

Although their fake bosoms initially felt hard and unnatural, within a few hours they were as soft as the real deal.

Embarking on an 'If I Were a Boy' Beyonce-style bucket list, the two men took to social media to share a few bra-clad selfies the before going bra shopping, hitting the gym and trialing their bouncy new body parts by using a skipping rope.

As they proudly showed off their new assets to the world, the men also found themselves the centre of attention - among other men.

By the end of the day, the men said they had a new understanding of how it feels to be a woman - even if not every part was good. 

John said having his chest stared at all the time made him feel small and the pair concluded: 'Bras are torture and every woman should get a medal for wearing this monster.'

The procedure the German DJs underwent to see what it's really like to be a girl is also available in the UK and is fast becoming a popular choice with the wealthy flat-chested. 

Dubbed 'vacation breasts' and 'party boobs', the beauty treatment that will only last long enough for a day at the beach or a night out.

Cosmetic specialist Dr Neetu Nirdosh, who is based in Harley Street, London, offers the 24 hour boob lift and she said it's been popular with her celebrity clients who want to have larger breasts for a red carpet event.

She told MailOnline how it works: 'Saline is injected into the breast tissue to give a very temporary breast enlargement. Within minutes a woman can go from a size A to C cup, but within hours the effect fades.

'The saline is essentially salty water so the body's metabolic system will get rid of it within 24 hours.

'It is not directly medically harmful, however you have to tread with caution with sodium based water as it may effect electrolyte balance in the body, so it is not wise to have several of these procedures close together. 

'Being water based, it spreads so it has a diffuse reaction of breast swelling.' 

She added: 'Women must understand that they are paying for a procedure that will flatten very rapidly. 

'It can be suitable pre-wedding, before parties, a day on the beach or red carpet events. As women are moving away from the idea of invasive breast augmentation due to recent scandal against PIP implants, and looking for non surgical alternatives, this can provide a realistic option to see what a surgical breast enhancement would look like.'

Dr Nirdosh warns though, if you are going to wake up next to a new boyfriend who is not familiar with your boob size, then they may be shocked that your breasts have shrunk in the morning.
