The Duke of Edinburgh was taken to hospital yesterday, but in typical style the Queen continued with her Diamond Jubilee celebrations alone.

Hours before the start of last night’s concert at Buckingham Palace, Prince Philip was taken by ambulance from Windsor Castle, where the royal couple had been resting following Sunday’s gruelling four-hour Thames pageant, after suffering abdominal pains.

The Duke, who will celebrate his 91st birthday on Sunday and underwent minor heart surgery at Christmas, is now at the King Edward VII Hospital in London where he has been diagnosed with a bladder infection.

Buckingham Palace said he would remain under the care of doctors for several days as a ‘precautionary’ measure.

‘He is, understandably, disappointed 
about missing this  evening’s Diamond Jubilee Concert and tomorrow’s 
engagements,’ a spokesman said.

The Queen, who was by her husband’s 
side when he left the castle, is being kept informed of his condition 
but has no plans to visit him in hospital.

And, with her husband’s blessing, she 
immediately reassured her  aides that the rest of the planned Jubilee 
events,  including today’s service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s 
Cathedral followed by a  carriage procession through London and a 
flypast over Buckingham Palace, would go ahead as planned.

Last night members of the Royal Family poignantly  left the Duke’s seat in the  Royal Box at Buckingham  Palace empty.

Treatment: The King Edward VII Hospital in London where the Prince is tonight receiving specialist care for a bladder infection. He was treated at the same hospital for a bladder infection in 2002

Bladder infections are much more common in women than men, but millions of men are afflicted each year.

They usually develop quickly and can be serious, even life-threatening, without prompt treatment.

The most common triggers include dehydration, poor immune system or an underlying medical problem such as enlarged prostate – which affects the vast majority of men in their 80s and older – bladder or kidney problems.

Symptoms include the frequent need to go to the lavatory, fever, and sometimes blood in the urine.

Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI) – the medical term – is normally confirmed by a simple urine test.

Antibiotics are the first line of treatment and usually work within five to seven days for younger patients.

However, if the infection is causing severe pain and the patient is elderly, hospital treatment may be prudent so that intravenous antibiotics can be administered.

Scans may be necessary and if the patient develops antibiotic resistance – an increasing issue in hospitals – the drugs can be changed to something more powerful.

UTIs may cause someone to feel unwell or create a sense of confusion and disorientation, which can be alarming when the sufferer is elderly.

This is usually resolved as the antibiotics start working, but every precaution will be taken when the patient is elderly.

The actual cause is bacteria within the patient’s body, which gets from its normal home in the bowel to the bladder which becomes infected.

The infection may stay in the bladder or, more seriously, travel back to the kidneys.

Dr Ian Banks, president of the Men’s Health Forum, said: ‘Prompt treatment should restore the Duke to health soon.’

The Queen was notably absent from the 
beginning of the concert, organised by Take That star Gary Barlow, but 
arrived half-way through, wearing a black cloak over a gold dress, in 
time for Madness to sing their hits Our House and It Must Be Love from 
the  palace roof.

While the Duke’s condition is not 
believed to be serious, doctors will not be taking any chances, given 
his advancing years, because bladder  infections in the elderly can  get
 worse very quickly if not treated promptly.

Questions are likely to be asked 
whether it was wise to allow the Duke, who had a stent inserted in his 
heart less than six months ago, to take part in Sunday’s Diamond Jubilee
 Pageant, standing in the rain for four hours.

It is understood that staff at 
ambulance control in Berkshire received a call from Windsor Castle 
shortly after 2pm reporting that Prince Philip was  feeling unwell.

The medical crew used a chair to help him into the ambulance.

Despite his advancing years the 
Queen’s husband has always enjoyed good health and most of his past 
ailments have been sports-related.

Before undergoing heart surgery at 
Christmas his most recent previous illness was a cold in October last 
year which forced him to pull out of an overnight stay in Italy.

One of his most serious bouts of ill 
health came in 2008 when he was admitted to hospital in London with a 
chronic chest infection.

The Duke’s absence from the rest of the Diamond Jubilee events will come as a terrible blow to his wife of 64 years.

Although she is, ostensibly, the ‘senior partner’ in their relationship, she relies on her husband ‘utterly’.

‘It may be a cliché but he truly is the power behind the throne,’ said a source.

Earlier this year the Duke, who is 
linked to more than 800 organisations, announced plans to scale back on 
all but his most important patronages, in the first nod he has  given to
 his age.

But he still carries out more than 350 engagements a year, making him one of the hardest-working members of the Royal Family.

In an interview to mark his 90th birthday with the BBC, the outspoken Duke admitted he was reducing his workload.

‘I reckon I’ve done my bit, I want to enjoy myself for a bit now,’ he said.

‘With less responsibility, less rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say.

‘On top of that your memory’s going, I can’t remember  names. Yes, I’m just sort of winding down.’

For the majority of his 90 years, Prince Philip has been notable for his robust constitution, and most of the ailments that have troubled him have been sports-related or accidental. 

In 1961, the Duke broke a bone in his left ankle in a collision on the polo field.

Three years later, he was X-rayed after pulling a ligament in his left shoulder in a fall from his polo pony. 

Polo also left him suffering from arthritis in his right wrist, a condition made worse by shaking many thousands of hands at official functions.

More recently, in 2004, he was seen with dark glasses and a badly bruised left eye after slipping in the bath and catching the side of his eye with his thumb.

In August 2008, Buckingham Palace 
took the unusual step of speaking out to deny a newspaper report that the Duke had
 been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

The newspaper involved later apologised, saying it accepted the story was untrue.

In January 2009, 87-year-old Philip 
missed a string of engagements with a bad back after pulling a muscle 
while carriage driving.

And in 2009 he was forced to cancel several engagements after suffering a strained back – while carriage-driving – which left him in ‘excruciating pain’.

Yet aides have admitted it is difficult to persuade Philip to slow down, with one saying: ‘No one would ever dare tell him to take it easy – you might as well take your life in your hands.’

In May 2006, the Duke pulled out of a royal engagement after suffering from a trapped nerve in his neck. After a weekend recovering, he attended the Chelsea Flower Show, appearing none the worse for wear.

In 2008, the Duke was admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital in London with a chronic chest infection. At the time, senior royal sources told the Mail they had quite a job persuading him to seek further treatment after failing to fight off a heavy cold.

The Duke vociferously protested that Dr John Cunningham, the Queen’s personal physician, was over-reacting. But after battling the infection for several days, he finally accepted the doctor’s advice.

‘Typically, the Duke grumbled and complained,’ said a source. ‘He did not want to go in. He really isn’t the best kind of patient.’

Not a single member of his family paid him a visit during his three-night stay, although aides said that it was just the way he liked it. ‘The Duke cannot bear anyone making a fuss. It would have been the last thing he wanted,’ said one.
