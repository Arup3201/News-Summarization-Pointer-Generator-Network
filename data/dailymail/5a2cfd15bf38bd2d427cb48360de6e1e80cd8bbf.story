He may be out of the Wimbledon championships – but the reasons for Andy Murray’ s four-letter outbursts during his humiliating defeat by Grigor Dimitrov were still being feverishly discussed on Thursday.Did a row with his girlfriend Kim Sears a few minutes before play prompt him to turn towards the players’ box and shout incredulously: ‘Five minutes before the f***ing match?’

Had there been a disagreement with his new coach Amelie Mauresmo? And who was the target of his ‘Shut the f*** up!’ attack, which he screamed in the direction of Miss Sears, Miss Mauresmo and his mother Judy Murray? 

Here – as Murray prepares to return to 
training in Miami – the Daily Mail examines speculation surrounding his 
flare-up and names the main suspects.

Anger: Andy Murray was out of sorts on Wednesday against Grigor Dimitrov, he was knocked out in straight sets

Saddening: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears watches on as the Bulgarian beats the Scot on Centre Court

KIM SEARS: The story of Murray’s defeat was chronicled blow by blow in the facial expressions of his loyal girlfriend Kim Sears.

Occasionally she appeared to offer advice beyond the standard ‘Come on Andy!’, preferred by much of the Centre Court crowd.

Fact: They didn’t leave together after the match – Andy jumped in an All England Club courtesy car immediately after his post-match press conference and had not changed out of his kit.

Their separate departures would not normally be cause for speculation but Miss Sears did accompany him after his 2012 defeat by Roger Federer – and on Wednesday was said to have been ‘looking upset’ when she left without him.

Wicked internet speculation that she had chosen five minutes before the big match to dump him/tell him she was pregnant/say she had always liked Roger cannot be substantiated. But the breaking news on Thursday night was that Miss Sears had accidentally let slip the ending of a box-set TV series they had been watching.

On Thursday his grandfather Roy Erskine, 82, said of the ‘five-minutes’ mystery: ‘Normally he’ll be alone in his dressing room so I have no idea what could possibly have gone wrong.’

Falling out? Rumours were spreading fast on social media after the defeat

AMELIE MAURESMO: The French former world number one started coaching Murray after he lost in the semi-finals of the French Open last month.Recently when asked about their professional partnership, she volunteered that things were getting ‘smoother and smoother’ perhaps implying there was a time when they were less so.

Fact: Miss Mauresmo was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors’ box just moments before Murray came on to court to face Dimitrov. Did she tell him to change his strategy? Might she have clashed with him over tactics? Was something she said playing on Murray’s brooding mind?

On Thursday a track-suited Murray arrived at her flat near the ground for a pre-arranged meeting. He was carrying what appeared to be a card in an envelope with a single name written on it. Cards declaring ‘Sorry I Told You to Shut The F*** Up’ are not widely available – but in any case, it is Amelie’s 35th birthday on Saturday.

The pair spent more than two hours inside before Andy left alone. But conspiracy theories which suggested coach and player were about to separate amid some unspecified acrimony fell flat when he failed to stomp out in a strop.

JUDY MURRAY: Andy’s mother and long-time former coach remains a constant presence. Except, that is, for some possibly critical minutes on Wednesday at the start of the match.

Fact: Mrs Murray was at court 18 to cheer her other son, Jamie, to victory in his mixed doubles opener with Australian Casey Dellacqua.  Little brother Andy had already lost the first set by the time she arrived.

Last week Andy joked he was ‘the number two son’, and that his family seemed to spend a great deal of time watching the number one.

Another theory: Was Mrs Murray shouting advice that contradicted Murray’s coach?  Perhaps. But even for a grumpy Scot in a foul mood, it is surely beyond the realms of possibility that he would tell his own mother to ‘shut the f*** up’. Afterwards she stressed she knew of nothing that might have upset him.

Difference of opinion: Was Judy Murray shouting advice that contradicted Mauresmo's?

MAGGIE MAY: The couple’s beloved border terrier, named after the Rod Stewart hit, has previously used Twitter throughout her master’s Wimbledon appearances. This year she has not tweeted even a bark. Has she been unwell?

Fact: Four years ago Mrs Murray revealed Andy was ‘worried sick’ throughout the tournament after Maggie fell ill.

THE BANANA: Murray has previously relied on bananas for their energy-giving qualities. Fact: On the advice of a nutritionist, he cut back on bananas last year – and won Wimbledon. This year he admitted he was back on them – and lost.FATE: Play began on Centre Court at noon rather than the usual time of 1pm. Murray’s early start led to suggestions afterwards that he he was not mentally prepared for his game.  Was he given only five minutes’ notice of the change? Murray dismissed the speculation in his BBC blog, declaring: ‘There was nothing different in the build-up, and no reason to expect that kind of performance.’   ANDY MURRAY: Perhaps the player himself is the only real suspect. Could it simply be that he lost? It is the only theory he publicly supports. ‘Yeah,’ said Murray. I certainly lost the match, yeah.’

Pushing himself? Or maybe, the disastrous performance was all down to Murray himself?
