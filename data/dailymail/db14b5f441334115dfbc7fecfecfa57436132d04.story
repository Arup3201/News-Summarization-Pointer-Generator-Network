Arsenal have certainly signed a talented defender with the
arrival of Southampton right-back Calum Chambers to the Emirates in a £12million
deal but are his singing skills up to scratch?

The highly-regarded defender faced his new team mates with a
rendition of the indie classic ‘Naïve’ from the Kooks which came out when
Chambers was just 11-years-old in 2006.

Chambers only made 23 first team appearances for Southampton
but Arsene Wenger has seen enough to recognise his potential.

Naive: Arsenal new boy Calum Chambers belted out the Kooks song 'Naive' as his initiation to the squad

The England U-19 international is a product of Southampton’s
highly successful academy and becomes the third player after Theo Walcott in
2006 and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in 2011 to swap the south coast for north
London.

Sportsmail understands that manager Arsene Wenger plans to
convert Chambers in to a centre back in the long term.

He has signed for an initial £12m - the same price Arsenal
paid for Oxlade-Chamberlain - but his fee could eventually rise to £16m in
add-ons.

Wenger is impressed with the defender's versatility and it
is hoped that in time he could become as influential as former captain Tony
Adams.

Chambers said: 'I am so happy to be signing for Arsenal.
They are a team I have much admired for their playing style, and a team who
have been one of the top sides in Europe for many years. I'm looking forward to
joining up with my new team-mates today and beginning preparation for the
season ahead.

'I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to
everyone at Southampton FC for everything they have done for me and for making
this move possible.'

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger added: 'We are very pleased
that Calum has agreed to join us. The way he adapted to the Premier League last
season with Southampton at a young age shows that he has tremendous quality.

'He
has a lot of the attributes that we look for in a young player and I am sure
that he will do well with us.'

Settling in: Chambers was welcomed to Arsenal by goal keeper Wojciech Szczesny on his Facebook page

The defender is with his new team-mates in Austria, with
keeper Wojciech Szczesny posting a welcome picture and message of himself,
Chambers and Oxlade-Chamberlain on the team bus.

Chambers will fight for a first-spot with Mathieu Debuchy,
who Arsenal signed from Newcastle for £10m after Bacary Sagna joined Manchester
City. His arrival means Carl Jenkinson may now leave the Emirates with Hull and
West Ham interested in him.
