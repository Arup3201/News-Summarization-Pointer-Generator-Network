England's Twitter account has come under criticism from supporters after promoting Ashley Cole as a candidate for England's Player of the Year, despite playing just one game.

The full-back started in a 1-0 friendly win against Denmark back in March at Wembley but retired from international duty after missing out on Roy Hodgson's squad to travel to Brazil for the World Cup.

However England's official Twitter account posted Cole as a potential candidate to pick up the gong, which is voted for by fans, based on picking up his 107th and final cap during 2014.

England's Twitter account has astonished its followers by promoting Cole as a Player of the Year candidate despite playing just one game in 2014 

Frank Lampard (2): 2004, 2005

Steven Gerrard (2): 2007, 2012

Wayne Rooney (2): 2008, 2009

David Beckham: 2003

Owen Hargreaves: 2006

Ashley Cole: 2010

Scott Parker: 2011

Reaction to the post ranged from sarcasm to astonishment as one user posted: 'To suggest he should win it is a slap in the face...how can you win POY when you play once!''

Despite ending the year with six straight wins, 2014 will go down as a dismal year for the Three Lions having crashed out of the World Cup in disastrous circumstances after finishing bottom of their group without a victory in Brazil.

Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart are among the front runners to win the senior award.

Cole's nomination comes following a dismal failure by England at the World Cup, with the current Roma star left behind for the trip to Brazil which prompted his international retirement

Barring 2013, the online poll has been running since 2003 and was first won by David Beckham.

Rooney is hoping to win the award for a record third time following success in 2008 and 2009.

The FA also have an additional two categories to vote in, with Jack Butland and Steph Houghton among the respective contenders for Under 21 Player of the Year and Women's Player of the Year.
