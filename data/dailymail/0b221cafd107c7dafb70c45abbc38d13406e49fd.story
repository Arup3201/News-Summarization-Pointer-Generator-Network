A very dedicated mother granted her daughter's wish for a 'birthday cake big enough to ride' by spending a week making her a life-size My Little Pony birthday cake - standing 4ft 3in tall.

Maria Young, 29, constructed the mammoth pink pony from 26kg of icing, 86 eggs and 32 boxes of Rice Krispies.

It was presented at daughter Emily's eighth birthday party - and ended up feeding 900 people after she took the leftovers to school.

Maria spent £160 on ingredients and the colossal cake contained 16 roasting tins of sponge and 250,000 calories.

The mother-of-three has only been baking for a year after her son Logan, nine, demanded a dinosaur cake for his birthday.

She said: 'I'm not a baker, I'm just a mad mother. Last year my son asked me to make a standing-up dinosaur cake and it ended up at 2ft 3in.

'I told Emily she could have one this year and she asked for a My Little Pony one and she said she wanted it as tall as her. It actually ended up taller.'

The cake is constructed around a wooden frame which was then packed with sticky Rice Krispies moulded to form the legs, neck and head.

Master chef: The huge cake, containing well in excess of a quarter of a million calories, was crafted from 26kg of icing, 86 eggs and 32 boxes of Rice Krispies, lovingly layered over a wooden sub-structure

Work in progress: The pony's body was created with several layers of sponge cake with blueberry flavoured cream filling

The body was then built up with several layers of sponge cake with blueberry flavoured cream filling and the whole model was then smothered in pink icing.

Delighted Emily nicknamed the cake 'Pinkie Pie' but the handful of friends at her birthday part barely made a dent in the sweet treat.

Work of art: Maria has no formal baking or sculpture training and instead uses techniques she's seen on television to craft her mammoth cakes

So she shared it with her neighbours and took the leftovers to school - and in total 900 people enjoyed a slice.

Delighted Emily, of Dorking, Surrey, said: 'I love it. It's even bigger than I imagined it would be.'

Maria lives with husband Wayne and their three children, Emily, Logan and three-year-old Brooke.

A piece of cake! Maria made so much cake that she shared in with her neighbours and took the leftovers to school - and in total 900 people enjoyed a slice

However, she has no plans to take on such a huge project again.

She said: 'I told her she could have whatever cake she wanted. Serves me right I suppose. She asked for a 'pony cake big enough for me to ride'.

'I saw all these American TV shows where people bake massive cakes and I just thought "it can't be that hard".

'I just make it up as I go along. But I'm pleased it's all over. Now I can get to sleep before midnight.'
