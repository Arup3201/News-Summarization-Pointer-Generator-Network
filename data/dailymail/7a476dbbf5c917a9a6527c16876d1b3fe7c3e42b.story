Moderate consumption of wine or spirits increases the risk of the heart condition atrial fibrillation

Drinking just one glass of wine a day could trigger a stroke, heart failure or dementia, researchers have warned.

Moderate consumption of wine or spirits - defined as between one and three drinks a day - increased the risk of an irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation (AF).

The condition is one of the most common heart rhythm problems and significantly raises the risk of stroke.

This is because when the upper chambers of the heart do not pump efficiently, as in atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of blood clots forming.

In extreme cases, AF can cause heart failure and has also been linked to Alzheimer's disease by reducing blood flow to the brain.

The researchers say that while many 
studies have shown that light to moderate drinking can reduce the risk 
of heart disease and stroke, it is important to balance these benefits 
against the potential risk of developing AF.

The study, of almost 80,000 people in Sweden,Â  found those who indulged in moderate consumption of wine and liquor, were more likely to develop the condition.

However the research, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, did not identify a similar association beer - even when people binged on it.

Researcher Professor Susanna Larsson, of the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, said: 'We have no explanation for the lack of association with beer consumption.

'It is likely beer is consumed more regularly during the week, whereas wine and liquor are more often consumed only at the weekend.'

She added it might be possible to reverse the damage by spreading out alcohol consumption over the week, rather than drinking a lot in one go.

The study, which tracked the food and alcohol consumption of middle-aged and elderly people over 12 years, found the more people drank on a single occasion, the higher the risk of AF.

Atrial fibrillation causes a fast and irregular heartbeat, usually over 100 beats a minute. Other symptoms include dizziness, breathlessness and tiredness

Previous research has also shown a link between heavy drinking and abnormal heart patterns.

An international study carried out over 12 years tested nearly 37,000 women and found that those who drank the equivalent of 14 alcoholic units a week - the maximum intake for women according to UK Government guidelines - were 60 per cent more likely to develop atrial fibrillation.

The most obvious symptom of atrial fibrillation is becoming aware of a fast and irregular heartbeat (palpitations), usually over 100 beats a minute. Other symptoms include dizziness, breathlessness, chest pain (angina) and tiredness.
