A goal to restore some Manchester United belief, a goal to stop Chelsea turning the Barclays Premier League into their own private show. They will be thankful for this much further afield than Old Trafford.

It was, it must be said, something of a throwback moment. Only seconds remaining and the ball hits the back of the net at the Stretford End so hard that it could have burst. In the car parks, those who had abandoned their seats — abandoned hope — minutes earlier must have felt the ground tremble a little beneath their feet.

This time, the cause was a little different of course. Over the years, United have scored late goals to win titles and cup ties. There was a period when it wasn’t a case of wondering whether United would equalise but whether they would go on and win, too.

Here, it wasn’t about that. Not this time. This was a goal — struck purely from the laces of Robin van Persie — that gave United a little of their self-respect back. The point it earned them probably won’t matter particularly at the end of the season but if it brings with it some momentum then it could prove priceless.

This was a fixture that United supporters had been eyeing with some trepidation for a while. The first ‘big’ game of the season. There was a question, nervously asked, that if Swansea, Leicester and MK Dons could beat Louis van Gaal’s team then just what could the leaders of the Premier League do here?

So, yes, this was not so much about the here and now but the future.

There may have been some fortune about the free-kick awarded to them when Branislav Ivanovic tangled with Angel di Maria down the left side, which resulted in a red card for a second booking. But the way Marouane Fellaini arrived to power a header towards goal said as much for his own restored confidence as it did United’s conviction that they could take something. Van Persie’s finish, meanwhile, was reminiscent of better days.

United’s centre forward had been poor prior to that moment, as he has been for much of the season.

Twice he had failed to beat Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in one-on-one situations while he had also been partly culpable when Didier Drogba headed Chelsea in to the lead early in the second half, drifting off the near post a fraction before the ball arrived.

Van Persie remains some way from his best. With Wayne Rooney back from suspension for next week’s Manchester derby and Radamel Falcao expected to be fit, he may not even start. His assessment of his team after the final whistle  was nevertheless interesting.

‘In my opinion we are better every day,’ he said. ‘In training and if you look at games you can see we are comfy on the ball and we are playing better.’

Had United been playing a full-strength Chelsea  they may have suffered. The league leaders missed injured striker Diego Costa desperately.

Drogba fought manfully at the point of Chelsea’s attack but the absence of Costa’s pace served to undo much of the terrific approach play of Eden Hazard and the Brazilian Oscar.

United were missing players too, though, and the way Van Gaal dragged improved performances from Fellaini and young Adnan Januzaj said something about him and indeed the way his team are finally beginning to understand the principles he likes to talk so much about. Fellaini was terrific on Sunday. He looked focused, athletic and energetic.

He used to be like that at Everton before he succumbed to the ‘big club syndrome’ that similarly afflicted his manager David Moyes last season.

Here he worked manfully to stifle Cesc Fabregas and it worked. Chelsea’s playmaker will rarely have a quieter game. The Belgian was similarly influential at the other end of the field, though, and may well have played his way in to next Sunday’s derby team.

Chelsea will have gone home disappointed. Denied victory by Frank Lampard’s late goal at City last month and by Van Persie’s strike here, Jose Mourinho knows that his team’s lead over the champions City could already be 11 points. As it is, it is a much more modest six.

Mourinho’s team have the look of the best in the country at the moment. There is an energy and dexterity about the Chelsea midfield that can appear irresistible at times.

On Sunday, though, they were matched — if not bettered — for long periods by United. For Van Gaal and his team, that represents progress.
