One of America’s most famous historical figures who wrote the Declaration of Independence might not have fathered his slave’s children after all.

It had been believed for more than a decade that former U.S. President Thomas Jefferson fathered his slave Sally Hemings’s youngest son, Eston.

But DNA evidence that showed a Jefferson male fathered the boy actually suggests Mr Jefferson’s brother Randolph was the dad, a new book says.

It’s an important debate because of America’s history of slavery and race - and Mr Jefferson’s controversial ownership of slaves.

The book's release comes as the Smithsonian's 
National Museum of African American History and Culture plans an exhibit
to explore Mr Jefferson's history with slavery.

Museum
officials say the exhibit, to be opened in January, will tackle the sensitive subject of slavery during 
the American Revolution.

Mr Jefferson called slavery an 'abominable crime' but was a lifelong slaveholder.

The scholars’ book also disputes beliefs that Ms Hemings's children received special treatment from the president, which suggested a special bond with the president.

‘It is true that Sally’s sons Madison and Eston were freed in Jefferson’s will,’ commission chairman Robert F. Turner told the Washington Times.

‘But so were all but two of the sons and grandsons of Sally’s mother Betty Hemings, who still belonged to Thomas Jefferson at the time of his death.

‘Sally’s sons received by far the least favourable treatment of those freed in Thomas Jefferson’s will,’ the former University of Virginia professor said.

The book, entitled ‘The Jefferson-Hemings Controversy: Report of the Scholars Commission’, will be released on Thursday.

The commission was formed by request of the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society - a group that tries to defend his image.

Richard Dixon, of the Jefferson Heritage Society, told the Washington Times the book is important as shows ‘the issue is not proven’.

‘It does address (these) reasons why Jefferson could have been the father in a detailed manner - and shows the fallacies in these reasons,’ he said.

The Thomas Jefferson Foundation in Virginia says the evidence they have seen suggests he was the father, but it cannot be proven either way.

'It does address (these) reasons why Jefferson could have been the father, in a detailed manner, and shows the fallacies in these reasons, and should bring the reader back to a point where the issue is not proven'

It all dates back to the early 1800s 
when a newspaper claimed Mr Jefferson had fathered ‘several children’ 
with a slave called Sally.

Evidence released almost 200 years later in 1998 showed a genetic link between family descendants of Mr Jefferson and Eston Hemings, reported the Washington Times.

It's also believed Mr Hemings’s family said his father was an ‘uncle’, which scholars say is referring to Mr Jefferson’s brother Randolph.

He would have been referred to as ‘uncle’ by Mr Jefferson’s daughters.
