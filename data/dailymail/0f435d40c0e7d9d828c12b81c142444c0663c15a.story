Tesco is planning to build thousands of homes on land previously earmarked for supermarkets.

The chain owns vast areas of undeveloped land across the UK and will now use it to build 4,000 properties.

The decision comes as Tesco shifts its focus from large out-of-town supermarkets to smaller convenience stores and online retail.

Tesco reportedly owns 310 out-of-town sites which it has not built on, making up a total area of 1,100 acres

Last month it was revealed that 
Britain’s biggest retailer was hoarding more than 1,000 acres of 
undeveloped land, after buying hundreds of out-of-town sites during the 
1990s and 2000s, most of which were earmarked for Tesco Extra 
hypermarkets.

But last year 
the company wrote down the value of its land by £800million after 
admitting that much of it would never be built on.

It is estimated that Tesco owns 310 undeveloped sites across Britain, which could be used to build 15,000 homes.

Now, the retailer has scheduled that 4,000 homes will be built on its land by 2017, according to Property Week magazine.

The extent of Tesco's combined undeveloped land is the equivalent of three Hyde Parks, pictured, and would be enough to build the entire expanse of the Government's planned new garden city at Ebbsfleet, Kent

Tesco,
 which has a £20billion property portfolio, has yet to decide whether to
 sell the land to developers or build the homes itself, using developer 
Spenhill, which it owns.

Philip Clarke, Tesco chief executive, says he is facing the worst trading environment in his 40-year history

A Tesco spokeman said: ‘We are currently 
working on plans for over 4,000 homes across the UK, either by building 
them ourselves or selling our sites to housing developers.

‘In
 places where we have already delivered housing schemes, for example in 
Faversham or Highams Park, the feedback from local communities and 
councils has been very positive. We are pleased to be bringing new 
investment to communities up and down the country and playing our part 
in meeting local housing needs over the coming years.’

Last month Tesco announced its worst results for 20 years, with sales falling by 3.8 per cent over the past three months.

Out-of-town
 supermarkets have seen sales decline as British shoppers give up their 
big weekly visits and turn to smaller convenience stores and online 
retailers.

German discounters Aldi and Lidl have also provided competition to the supermarkets.

As
 a result, Tesco is slowing down its stores opening programme and 
revamping its existing hypermarkets by installing restaurants, coffee 
shops and bakeries.

The company said: ‘As we have previously announced, 
in response to changing customer shopping habits we have decided to 
reduce the amount of new store space we build each year, building fewer 
large stores.

‘Where we no longer intend  to develop sites, we sell them,  lease them or develop them  for housing.’
