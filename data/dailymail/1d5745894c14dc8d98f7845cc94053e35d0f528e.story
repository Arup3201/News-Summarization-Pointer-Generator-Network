Stuart Broad admitted he had never seen anything like it as India collapsed to a sensational eight for four on the first morning of the fourth Investec Test in Manchester.

The Indians were eventually skittled for 152, with a Test-record six batsmen making ducks and Broad taking six for 25. England closed on 113 for three, having lost Gary Ballance in the final over of a pulsating day.

Broad, who confirmed he will have an operation on his right knee — either at the end of this series or the one-dayers which follow — said: ‘It felt like we could get a wicket any ball. To have them eight for four — I can’t remember when we’ve knocked over a top order like that.

‘We got lucky with the overheads in the morning, when it became quite cloudy and heavy. But we weren’t lucky when it came to the skills we produced. With the nicks carrying, it was a huge advantage for us.’

Broad and Jimmy Anderson — who finished with three for 46 and barely said a word all day after the sledging rumpus ahead of this game — struck twice each as India lost their first four wickets without adding a run in the space of 13 scarcely believable deliveries.

‘When it’s swinging like that, Jimmy’s got it on a string both ways. He bowled beautifully and looks in great rhythm. And lots of his runs came from nicks to third man.’

Broad has faced speculation all summer about the tendinitis of the patella he has been suffering, and a specialist will arrive from Sweden at the end of next week’s final Test at The Oval to determine the precise date of the operation. 

He may be out for anything up to three-and-a-half months, but insisted he would be fit for the World Cup early next year.

On Thursday, he bowled as if surgery was the last thing on his mind, and sang the praises of the Old Trafford pitch. ‘It was brilliant to challenge the batsmen on the front foot knowing the nicks would carry,’ he said.

‘The top order didn’t get time to settle, and the bouncer went through pretty well too. When we lost the toss, I was a bit disappointed, but it turned out to be a fantastic toss to lose.’

Ravichandran Ashwin, one of only three Indians to make double figures, said: ‘I’m pretty blank at this point in time. But if we get some helpful conditions tomorrow and a couple of early wickets, we’re right back in this game.’
