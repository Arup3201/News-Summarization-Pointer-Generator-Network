A Dallas nurse who recovered from Ebola has been reunited with her dog Bentley, who has spent 21 days in quarantine.

The King Charles Cavalier spaniel has undergone twice-daily check-ups by vets in hazmat suits at a secret naval base while his owner, Nina Pham, was treated for the deadly virus.

This morning, the pair were reunited privately on Saturday at the secret location near the Texan city where he had been isolated since she fell ill.

As Pham, 26, underwent blood transfusions and hospital transfers to tackle the deadly virus, Bentley underwent twice-daily check-ups by vets in hazmat suits at the decommissioned naval air base near Dallas. 

Tearful, Pham said at a news conference Saturday that she was thankful for the thoughts and prayers for 'me and Mr Bentley,' whom she called 'one of my best friends.'

Pham was diagnosed with Ebola last month. 

She contracted the virus while caring for the Liberian patient Thomas Eric Duncan, who died on October 8.

City spokeswoman Sana Syed said on Thursday that the dog has tested negative for Ebola and that his 21-day quarantine — the Ebola incubation period — ends Saturday. 

Pham recovered and was released October 24 from a Washington, D.C.-area hospital.

Under observation: Workers in hazmat suits removed Bentley from Pham's home, and took him to a special isolation room at a nearby naval base. He has been treated by veterinarians and other workers every day. On Thursday he tested negative for Ebola for a third time

Pham was one of two nurses to contract Ebola after treating Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.

Nurse Amber Vinson has also been cured of the deadly disease which has currently claimed nearly 5,000 lives, mainly in the West African nations of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

That leaves only one person currently being treated for Ebola in the U.S. Dr Craig Spencer of New York is currently being treated for the disease in an isolation wing at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital.

He came down the disease less than a week after returning from West Africa where he was performing aid work with Doctors Without Borders.

Ms Pham was the first Ebola patient in the U.S. to have been in contact with a pet as she came down with the virus.

While dogs are not known to be the virus' natural carriers, it's still unclear whether they indeed spread it to humans if they've come into contact with someone who is infected. 

In Spain, those questions caused officials to put down the dog of nurse there who became infected. 

Excalibur, who belonged to Spanish nurse and Ebola patient Teresa Romero, was destroyed days after Romero was diagnosed.

The move sparked widespread outrage and mass protests in the streets of Madrid - as Romero was later cleared of the virus.

Pham's family revealed they pleaded with the district judge to let Bentley survive.
