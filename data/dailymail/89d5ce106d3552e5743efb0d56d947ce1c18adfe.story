A top secret CIA base in Saudi Arabia where lethal drones strikes have been launched from has been exposed on internet search giant Bing, it was claimed today.

A blogger has spotted an unmarked facility that has runways, hangars and what appear to be living quarters and offices buried deep in the desert.

It follows claims by the New York Times that it had revealed the CIA uses a base in Saudi Arabia to target Al Qaeda operatives in neighbouring Yemen.

It was from this base that the American-born operative Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in 2011.

Noah Shachtman, who runs Wired's Danger Room blog, said: 'The base's hangars bear a remarkable resemblance to similar structures found on other American drone outposts.

'And its remote location — dozens of miles from the nearest highway, and farther still to the nearest town – suggests that this may be more than the average civilian airstrip.'

Shachtman also claimed on Wired he has earned tacit confirmation from two former American intelligence officers that the location is correct.

'I believe it's the facility that the U.S. uses to fly drones into Yemen,' one of them told Shachtman. 'It's out in eastern Saudi Arabia, near Yemen and where the bad guys are supposed to hang out.

'It has those clamshell hangars, which we've seen before associated with U.S. drones.'

It is located deep in the desert in Saudi Arabia near the border with Yemen, which has been the target of U.S. drone strikes

The other officer described the location as 'way, way out in the Rub al Khali, otherwise known as Hell'.

The facility's whereabouts had remained 
secret at the request of high-ranking officials, although it was known 
that one had been built.

Earlier this week a human rights organisation has claimed that up to 54 countries may have helped the CIA to hold terrorism suspects in secret prisons, or turn them over to foreign governments.

The revelation comes amid a growing outcry against the Obama administration's use of deadly drones and their use to watch American citizens. 

Congress is now trying to limit the power the U.S. has to kill suspected terrorists, including American citizens, with drones.

In response, the government defended its lethal drone programme by citing the laws that were introduced following the September 11 attacks.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons said in a recent: 'It has to be in the agenda of this Congress to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the United States around the world because the original authorisation of use of force, I think, is being strained to its limits,'

Congressman Steny Hoyer, the number two Democrat in the House of Representatives, said: 'It deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out, kill, eliminate, whatever word you want to use, not just American citizens but other citizens as well.'

Hoyer added: 'We ought to carefully review our policies as a country.'

Democratic Chairman Robert Menendez and
 the panel's top Republican, Senator Bob Corker, both have both quietly 
expressed concerns about the deadly operation and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is likely to hold hearings on US drone policy, an aide said on Tuesday.

One of the most successful drone 
strikes was the one in Yemen that killed three American citizens: Anwar 
al-Awlaki, his 16-year-old-son and Samir Khan.

Al-Awlaki
 was linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting 
US and Western interests, including the attempt to down a Detroit-bound 
airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010.

His son was killed in a separate strike on a suspected al-Qaida den. Khan was an al-Qaida propagandist.

White
 House spokesman Jay Carney called the strikes 'legal, ethical and wise'
 and said they are covered by a law that Congress approved allowing the 
use of military force against al-Qaida.

He added: 'It is a matter of fact 
that al-Qaida is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders, 
operational leaders of al-Qaida are continually plotting to attack the 
United States, plotting to kill American citizens as they did most 
horrifically on September 11th of 2001.'

The U.S. government can legally order the killing of American citizens if they have senior-level ties to al-Qaida

The use of drones has caused tensions in some countries where civilians have died

Three
 days after September 11, Congress approved a law authorising the 
military to use 'all necessary and appropriate force' against al-Qaida 
and other groups believed to be helping or harbouring the global terror 
network, including the use of drone strikes.

Because
 militants have since splintered into a number of affiliates and 
sympathisers the current laws could allow military force against 
thousands of people across the Middle East and North Africa who have 
limited or no ability to strike the US.

Both the CIA and the US military are authorised to remotely pilot unmanned, missile-carrying drones against terror suspects.

It's
 unknown exactly how many strikes have been carried out, but experts say
 that drone attacks in Pakistan are conducted by the CIA, while those in
 Yemen and Somalia, for example, are by military forces.

'The base's hangars bear a remarkable resemblance to similar structures found on other American drone outposts.'

The
 drones have strained diplomacy between the U.S. and the nations where 
the strikes are carried out, as civilians have been killed alongside the
 targeted terrorists, even though most nations have given Washington at 
least tacit agreement to carry out the attacks.

A Middle Eastern diplomat said that in Yemen, for example, an increase of U.S. drone strikes last month have killed dozens of people and upset the local public, leading some leaders in Sanaa to reconsider how often they should be used.

The Pentagon is also considering basing 
surveillance drones in Niger to monitor on burgeoning extremist violence
 in North Africa, but it's not clear if they will be armed, it has emerged.

The campaign against the use of drones to spy on U.S. citizens has also been growing in momentum.

Charlottesville, in 
Virginia, became the first city in the United States to pass a 
resolution against the use of drones for surveillance against American 
citizens.

It calls on Congress and the General 
Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia to bring in laws 'prohibiting 
information obtained from the domestic use of drones from being 
introduced into a Federal or State court.'

The resolution also 'pledges to abstain from similar uses with city-owned, leased or borrowed drones.'

Dede Smith, a council member who voted in favour of the bill, told US News that drones are 'pretty clearly a threat to our constitutional right to privacy.'

She added: 'If we don't get out ahead 
of it to establish some guidelines for how drones are used, they will be
 used in a very invasive way and we'll be left to try and pick up the 
pieces.'

The campaign has been helped by a 
Justice Department memo that has recently surfaced, which show drones 
can strike against a wider range of threats than previously believed.
