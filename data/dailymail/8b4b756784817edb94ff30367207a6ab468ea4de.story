An underage boy was 'groomed' by a man 26 years his senior after they met on gay hook-up app Grindr, a court has heard.

Gary Pearce messaged and swapped naked photographs with the 14-year-old on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex, it was said.

The boy had been 'curious' when he downloaded the app, which is for over-18s, and then lied about his age to sign up, it was said.

Pearce, 40, then drove in his silver sports car to meet the boy in the car park of Asda in Bexleyheath at the end of the summer holidays in 2012, Inner London Crown Court heard.

They then went back to Pearce's house in Sidcup, Kent, where they engaged in a sex act and showered before Pearce dropped him back at the car park.

However, the boy's mother discovered messages on her son's mobile phone and confronted him before calling the police.

When Pearce was arrested, detectives found four indecent images of children in the trash folder of his computer which had been downloaded sometime around 2009.

He admitted picking up the teenager and engaging in a sex act but maintains he thought he was over the age of 16 - the age of consent.

He denies sexual activity with a child, meeting with a child following sexual grooming and making by downloading indecent images of children.

The jury was played a video interview given by the boy wearing his school uniform in December 2012 during which he insisted he told Pearce his real age early on.

He told detectives 'I said how old I was, I said I was 14 or 15' before the messaging continued.

Describing how they eventually met, the boy added: 'He waved at me and I was nervous because obviously I had never done it before.

'I don't remember what we talked about but he put his hand on my leg. I didn't expect it so I jumped but not too much.'

They then went to the home and the boy said that he had been shown around the house adding: 'We stripped down and we were kissing.' 

Asked if he had wanted to engage in the sex act, the teenager said: 'I didn't know what I wanted because obviously I was trying it out.'

Asked how he felt about what had happened during the interview, weeks after meeting Pearce he said: 'Well I now have sort of a girlfriend.'

The trial continues.
