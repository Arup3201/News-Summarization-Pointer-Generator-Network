High demand: Planning Minister Nick Boles warned 100,000 new homes will be built to accommodate the expanding British population

Vast swathes of the countryside will have to be sacrificed to build new homes for immigrants, the Planning Minister warned last night.

Nick Boles said migrants accounted for almost half of the housing demand, and his figures suggest 100,000 new homes a year will be needed to accommodate them. The minister added: ‘We can’t go on like this.’

Earlier this week, Mr Boles alarmed conservationists by saying up to two million acres of green fields may have to be concreted over to deal with the housing shortage.

Now he has become the first government minister to draw a clear link between housing demand and the legacy of Labour’s open-door immigration policy.

Mr Boles said: ‘The fact is – and I am critical of the lastgovernment’s immigration policies – we allowed the population of this country to expand dramatically.

‘The population of England has gone up by two million in the last ten years. These people now live here, these people are now British and they need homes just like other British people.

‘The fact is, 43 per cent of the new households which want a home, is accounted for by immigration.

‘We can’t go on like this. We need to have less immigration and more house-building and we might then have a civilised country.’

Mr Boles warned the scale of demand meant large swathes of countryside would have to be sacrificed, because there were not enough empty homes or developed sites.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said last month that the number of households was forecast to expand at the rate of 230,000 a year. The figure supplied by Mr Boles suggests that immigration will account for almost 100,000 of the total.

Mr Clegg said total house building amounted to just 117,000 last year, adding: ‘There’s only one way out of this housing crisis: We have to build our way out.’

Sir Andrew Green, founder of the think-tank MigrationWatch, said the public would be shocked by the figures, which are significantly higher than the Government’s previous estimate on the issue, which suggested immigration accounted for 36 per cent of new households.

Sir Andrew said: ‘At last a housing minister has been absolutely clear about the link between housing demand and immigration. The best way to deal with the housing crisis is to reduce immigration.’

At risk: With a lack of both empty homes and developed sites where new homes could be built, Green Belt land may have to be sacrificed

Mr Boles angered conservationists by suggesting the total area of land under development should be increased by a third to ease the housing shortage.

He said ministers would protect the Green Belt, but warned that large areas of ‘open land’ may have to be given over for housing. And he hit out at developers for building ‘pig ugly’ housing estates that deter communities from accepting any new development.

‘We’re going to protect the Green Belt but if people want to have housing for their kids they have got to accept we need to build more on some open land,’ Mr Boles said.

‘In the UK and England at the moment we’ve got about 9 per cent of land developed. All we need to do is build on another 2 to 3 per cent of land and we’ll have solved a housing problem.’

The National Trust accused Mr Boles of making up figures ‘on the back of a fag packet’, while the Campaign to Protect Rural England said his proposals were a licence to developers to ‘let rip’.

The new row underlines the scale of the challenge posed to Britain’s creaking infrastructure by the mass immigration policy presided over by Labour.

Critics claim that schools, hospitals and the welfare system have also been placed under massive strain by the decision to lift restrictions on those coming to live and work in this country.

The new figures will also place fresh pressure on ministers to deliver on David Cameron’s pre-election pledge to slash net migration by more than half, to fewer than 100,000 a year.

Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered officials to examine whether restrictions could even be placed on those coming here from other parts of the European Union.

Figures out this week revealed that the Government’s immigration cap is having an effect, with officials recording the biggest fall in numbers for 20 years. The net migration figure – the number added to the population after both immigration and emigration have been counted – dropped by nearly 25 per cent from 242,000 to 183,000.
