Brazilian police are investigating whether a gunshot was fired near a hotel where the Honduran national team arrived to stay a few hours later.

A police officer in the town of Porto Feliz in Sao Paulo state said it was unclear if the sound heard in front of the hotel was an actual gunshot, fireworks or even a car backfiring.

He says no spent cartridge was found in the street and neither the Transamerica Hotel, nor nearby buildings, showed sign of being hit by a bullet.

The officer spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he wasn't authorised to talk with the press.

Honduras' training camp is located in Porto Feliz, about 75 miles north-west of metropolitan Sao Paulo.
