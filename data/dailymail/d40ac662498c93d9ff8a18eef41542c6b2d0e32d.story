This is the moment a flock of sheep invaded the iconic Louvre museum in a protest over European Union subsidies.

The animals stormed the Paris landmark yesterday as French farmers campaigned against reforms to the union's agricultural policy.

They could be seen gathering beneath its famous glass pyramid, before being herded down a flight of stairs and into the gallery itself.

Inside the gallery: Dozens of tourists stopped to take photos of the sheep, which are pictured inside the Louvre

Dozens of tourists stopped to take photos of the sheep, which were being herded by the farmers and one sheepdog.

The protestors, from the Peasants' Confederation, were carrying banners reading 'PAC'astrophe' in reference to the reforms of the agricultural policy.

They were protesting against proposed subsidy cuts, which they claim unfairly punish small farms and favour big agribusiness.

They were also objecting the effects of the industrialisation of agriculture, saying they feared for farmers' jobs.Â

One dairy farmer, Laurent Pinatel, said small farms deserve support because they are important to France's economy, identity and culinary reputation.

'What we can see today is a desire on the part of the agricultural ministry to impose a marginalising policy which will get rid of farmers,' a spokesman for the farmers told Reuters.

'So we came here to say we don't belong to a museum and that our place is in the countryside, where we can revitalize the countryside, create jobs and develop quality produce.
