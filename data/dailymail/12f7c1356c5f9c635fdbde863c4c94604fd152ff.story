Mystery has surrounded the death of Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into space

Yuri Gagarin made history in 1961 when, aged just 27, he became the first man to journey into space.

His single Earth orbit on April 12 lasted 108 minutes and was one of the Soviet Union's most enduring Cold War victories.

Seven years later, the Russian cosmonaut was killed in a crash during a training flight - an event that has been shrouded in mystery ever since.

Among the conspiracy theories were that he was murdered on the orders of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev for an unspecified offence or disloyalty to the party; Gagarin had committed suicide; or that the plane had actually hit a UFO.

Kremlin archives declassified in early 2011 concluded that his MiG jet had swerved to avoid a weather balloon, causing the plane to go into a tailspin and hit the ground, killing him instantly.

But after 40 years of secrecy,  the real cause of Gagarin's death can be revealed, courtesy of fellow cosmonaut Aleksey Leonov.

Leonov, who was the first man to make a spacewalk, in 1965, had been part of an official committee set up to investigate the accident.

More importantly, he had been there on that fateful day in March.

And now, following the release of a 
newly declassified report - which Leonov has been allowed to make public - 
the 79-year-old can finally reveal the actual chain of events; something
 he has wanted to do for 20 years.

Aleksey Leonov, who was the first man to make a 
spacewalk, in 1965 (pictured), had been part of an official committee set up to 
investigate the accident. More importantly, he had been there on that 
fateful day in March when Gagarin's MiG went into a tailspin after apparently hitting a weather balloon, and crashed to the ground

'That [original] conclusion is believable to a civilian, not to a professional - but in fact, everything went down differently,' Leonov told Russia Today.

He explained that an unauthorised SU-15 fighter jet was flying dangerously close to Gagarin’s aircraft. 

Leonov said: 'In this case, the pilot didn’t follow the book, descending to an altitude of 450 metres.

'I know this because I was there; I heard the sound and talked to witnesses.

'While afterburning, the aircraft reduced its echelon [plane formation] at a distance of 10-15 metres in the clouds, passing close to Gagarin, turning his plane and thus sending it into a tailspin – a deep spiral, to be precise – at a speed of 750 kilometres per hour,' he told the Russian website. 

Leonov was well-placed to give such testimony. He had overseen parachute jump training at Chkavlovsky airfield, northeast of Moscow - from where Gagarin had set out.

At this point in his career, Gagarin was Deputy Training Director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre and was starting out as a fighter pilot again (as he had been in 1960).

After being allowed to make public his remarks after a newly declassified report was released, Leonov revealed that an unauthorised SU-15 fighter jet (file picture, above) was flying dangerously close to Gagarin's aircraft. It was this that caused his plane to go into a spin and crash

Due to bad weather, Leonov had been awaiting official confirmation that exercises would be cancelled that day, March 27.

He then heard a supersonic sound followed by an explosion seconds later. Reports of the calamity, near the village of Novoselovo, soon filtered back to the base.

Leonov formed part of the State Commission investigating the accident - and after finally gaining access to it, he discovered a litany of distorted facts.

Even though his comments had his name attached, they had been written by someone else. 

'Marked here was a sonic spike, a blast, followed by one-and-a-half or two seconds of supersonic noise... So, when I looked at the copy, I suddenly noticed that it stated this noise interval to be 15 to 20 seconds long instead of the two seconds that I had reported.

'That suggested that the two jets must have been no less than 50km apart,' he told RT.

Leonov knew that Gagarin's jet had plunged for 55 seconds at a speed of 750km, and made his own calculations. 

'We used a computer to figure out a trajectory that would relate to this interval of 55 seconds. And it turned out to be a deep spiral. Now, a jet can sink into a deep spiral if a larger, heavier aircraft passes by too close and flips it over with its backwash.

'And that is exactly what happened to Gagarin. That trajectory was the only one that corresponded with all our input parameters.'

However, there remains one further question - who was the other pilot?

The man responsible for the death of Gagarin is still alive, aged 80, and in poor health.

But as part of the deal of him going public, Leonov has been sworn to secrecy, and has promised never to reveal his identity.

The 19 candidates selected for the Vostok-1 flight were all test pilots, unafraid of speed, and slight enough in build to fit into the tiny 2m-wide (6ft) capsule.

The Soviet-era charm of Gagarin's humble roots may have favored him over others, including his backup Gherman Titov.

Born in the village of Klushino, some 150km (95 miles) west of Moscow, Gagarin's father was a carpenter and his mother a milkmaid.

The family was forced to live in a tiny mud hut when the village was burned down during the German occupation in World War Two.

'Yura (Gagarin) was a very quick learner. He assimilated everything new. His mind was stellar,' veteran Soviet space journalist Vladimir Gubarev said.

Gagarin sung Soviet hymns during the last checks, strapped atop the 30m-high (98 ft) rocket that would blast him into space from the long-secret Baikonur cosmodrome on the Kazakh steppe.

'Poyekhali! (Let's go!),' he cried, in a phrase that has become synonymous with Gagarin in Russia.

'The most emotional moment was when we heard he was walking and waving; his arms and legs were whole.

'We understood in one sigh that our five to six years of hard work had paid off and we had achieved something huge,' veteran cosmonaut Georgy Grechko said.

The United States responded 10 months later, when John Glenn made the first U.S. orbital flight.
