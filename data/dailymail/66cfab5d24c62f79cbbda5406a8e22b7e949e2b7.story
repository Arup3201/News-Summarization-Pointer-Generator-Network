The evidence was there in front of me — stark, incontrovertible and shocking — but I still found it hard to take in.

There on my computer screen, a familiar face swam into view. It belonged to Sarah Leacy, the carer who looked after my 90-year-old mum; the person in whom I invested my absolute trust.

My mum is vulnerable: she has dementia. But she is sociable and loves companionship. In the background, against the babble of her TV, I heard her voice drift in from the sitting room, raised in friendly chat.

Then Sarah’s face filled the screen. I watched her potter around the kitchen, and winced at the haphazard way she made mum’s sandwich — daubing butter carelessly on the bread, then tearing a sheet of plastic wrap with her teeth, to cover it.

But what happened next was chilling, heart-stopping. Sarah continued to chat to mum but, as she did so, I watched as in one deft movement she took a cash box from a cupboard, unlocked it, snatched a £10 note from it and stuffed it into her bra.

I felt a giddy mix of nausea and relief. My mum’s carer was a thief. And now, after a year, we finally had the evidence, caught on film by a hidden camera I had installed in Mum’s kitchen, to convict her.

Our mum Monica had relinquished control of her finances to us, her four children, when she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s three years ago, after Dad died: she knew nothing about the cash box from which we took money to buy her groceries, and we’d given no one permission to help themselves from it.

Monica's carer, Sarah Leacy, 33 was caught on hidden camera stealing from the elderly woman but denied the charges in court even after the footage was shown

So when money began to go missing — £10 one week, £20 the next; about £300 in all was unaccounted for — I turned detective and installed the hidden camera in Mum’s kitchen.

Now here it was: evidence that the thief who had so grotesquely abused the trust of a defenceless elderly woman was her carer. We could finally go to the police.

Last week, at Wimbledon magistrates’ court, Leacy, 33, was sentenced to 80 hours’ unpaid community work and ordered to pay £700 costs after being found guilty on two counts of theft.

She had denied the charges; what struck me was the act she put on. She hobbled into the witness box — a stout and robust-looking young woman with her fair hair scraped into a ponytail, but holding her back as if it ached, and sighing heavily.

When arrested, she had the temerity to swear on her ‘nan and granddad’s ashes’ that she had not taken the money. The evidence from the hidden camera was, however, irrefutable.

When she was shown it by the police, Leacy had burst into tears. Even then, she did not admit the truth, claiming instead that she’d taken the cash to buy groceries for our mother in Sainsbury’s.

The police had continued to press her: would CCTV footage from the supermarket corroborate this? Leacy was cornered. All she could do was bluster about having been ‘confused’. Her brazenness was outrageous. I watched her in court with disbelief.

She did not react when she was convicted, but my relief was profound, and I still feel a burning anger that a woman so lacking in scruples could have so flagrantly exploited such a kind and defenceless elderly woman.

Leacy, 33, sentenced last week, at Wimbledon magistrates’ court, (pictured) she was sentenced to 80 hours unpaid community work and made to pay £700 costs after being found guilty on two counts of theft.

Leacy had been helping Mum, who lived in a flat in a sheltered housing complex in Putney, South-West London, since October 2013. We’d realised — me, my geophysicist brother Stephen, 56, my sisters Eileen, 61, a surveyor, and Patricia, 59, a headteacher — that Mum’s mental acuity had declined sharply.

The decline had happened since my dad, Tom, died in 2011 at 90. Mum was at a loss; he’d been her companion for more than 60 years. They met through their church social club after the war when Mum was a telephonist at Manchester Airport and he was an engineer.

When she was diagnosed in October 2011 with Alzheimer’s, it didn’t come as a surprise. Even so, we were reassured by her doctors that, as long as she had help, she would be fine to live on her own.

So we found a flat for her, near Eileen, Stephen and me, and one or other of us would call round most days in the week. But Mum, also needed a daily visit from a carer. And this was how Sarah Leacy insinuated herself into a position of trust.

She was employed by an agency, and although Mum remained in many ways independent, she relied on her carer to administer her medication, make her a meal and clean her flat. Whenever I encountered Sarah, she seemed nice enough, but would gripe about the agency, claiming ‘they expect too much’. Actually, I felt sorry for her and empathised about the stress of the job.

Because of Mum’s Alzheimer’s, power of attorney for both financial and welfare matters had been signed over to Stephen and Eileen. Apart from her purse, which contained a few coins, Mum had no dealings with money. Because of this, we kept small sums in the flat for anything we might need to buy for her.

And each time we visited her, my siblings and I would email each other with details about how she was doing and what we had bought. Occasionally, we would forget and sometimes there was confusion as to how much had been left.

We were not suspicious at first, but decided we needed something more secure, so replaced the envelope with a cash tin with a key that was kept on a different shelf in the cupboard. In the early part of this year, we started noticing the money wasn’t totally accounted for.

Sometimes it was as it should be, other days I would email my brother and sister and ask: ‘Did you say you left £50? There’s only £40 now.’

After a few such queries, the truth dawned: money was disappearing. Given that Mum wasn’t aware of the box, she wasn’t taking it.

The incidences were increasing. With no evidence, we knew the police wouldn’t be able to do anything. I decided to turn detective and install a hidden camera.

I came across details for The London Spy Shop, which sells such devices, so phoned them to ask advice. As I told a member of staff what was going on, I burst into tears. ‘Someone is stealing from my mum,’ I sobbed. ‘She’s 90 and has Alzheimer’s, I don’t know what to do.’

The voice at the other end was calm and reassuring. After discussing various options, we settled on a small camera. It was installed in Mum’s galley kitchen, where we kept the cash box.

As days then weeks went by, I became more and more frustrated — money was going missing, but the camera wasn’t recording it. Sometimes the device hadn’t worked, other days I had taken it home to recharge it.

By June this year, I was getting disheartened and the family discussed removing the cash tin. But that would have meant capitulation. We would never find out who the offender was.

Even when the evidence began building up, I failed to believe what was unfolding before my eyes. The first clear CCTV clip I saw revealed Leacy opening a cupboard door. I heard the cash tin rattle. But, perhaps, she was retrieving something for Mum?

Next, I moved the camera to the top of the fridge. Just a couple of days later came indisputable evidence on film.

Leacy openly stole cash from Monica, 90,

There was Sarah talking to my mum, getting her tea ready, and brazenly stealing from the cash box. Shoving £10 into her bra as she continued to chat amicably.

Though justice has now prevailed, I still feel deep anger and disquiet. How dare a woman, whose job it is to care, so flagrantly abuse her position of trust.

As for Mum, she is unaware of what has gone on and now has a lovely new carer — a lady in her 60s called Jan — who deserves the title.

And while I fervently hope nobody else is exploited so ruthlessly, my suspicion is that many vulnerable elderly are being fleeced as my Mum was.

So my message, I’m afraid, is a cynical one: do not be too trusting. Don’t assume all carers worthy of their job description.
