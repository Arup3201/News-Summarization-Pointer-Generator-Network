Two boxers stunned their girlfriends by getting down on one knee and proposing to both of them, moments after finishing a gruelling fight.

Adrian Firkins, 44, and Ricky Welsby, 24, may not see eye to eye in the ring but the pair made the perfect team when it came to proposing to their partners on Friday night.

The pair had exchanged blows for three rounds after going toe-to-toe in the semi-pro BBU welterweight fight at the Copthorne Hotel, Merry Hill, in the West Midlands.

Debbie Tyler, 41, and Nikki Vyse, 22, were called into the ring for what they believed to be post-match photos

After the contest, promoter Peter Jackson called Debbie Tyler, 41 (Adrian's girlfriend) and Nikki Vyse, 22 (Ricky's girlfriend) into the ring for what they believed to be post-match promotional photos with their partners.

But the bruised and battered pair then shocked their other halves by dropping to one knee - after managing to stay on their feet for the entire fight - in order to pop the question.

To their delight both the women said yes before they received a standing ovation from the hundreds of fans watching.

Both boxers joked it was lucky that they didn't knock each other out during the fight and agreed a draw was a fitting result before their big moment.

Father-of-two Adrian, from Halesowen, West Midlands, said: 'I'm glad I got through it and didn't get knocked out, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to propose to Debbie.'

It was upon hearing that his opponent, Ricky, was planning to propose to his girlfriend that Adrian decided it ought to be a joint effort.

'I was speaking to Pete Jackson and he told me that my opponent was thinking about proposing to his missus before the fight.

'I had been thinking about doing the same so I told him, he spoke to Ricky and we decided to do it together.'

He added that having his opponent there with him gave him the added confidence to get through with the public proposal.

'I think it took a bit of pressure off knowing someone else was next to me on one knee. I spoke to Ricky before the fight and we both agreed how we were going to do it.

'I think we were both more nervous about the proposal than the fight.

'Once the result was read out we got the girls in the ring, Pete gave us the engagement rings and we both got on one knee at the same time.'

Not only was the proposal a shock for Debbie but also for the bystanders of the match who had no idea that the proposal was going ahead.

'Debbie was so shocked, she really couldn't believe it, so were my family and friends in the crowd, I hadn't told any of them so it came completely out of the blue for them.

'I'm happy she said yes and a bit 
relieved, it would have been pretty embarrassing if I would have been 
rejected in the middle of the ring in front of everyone.'

Debbie, a housekeeper, who has been 
with Adrian for 16 years, added: 'I know it happened on Friday but I 
think I am still in shock. I just really didn't expect him to do something like that.

The girlfriends weren't the only ones in shock, no one in the crowd was aware of the planned proposal

'When he went down on one knee I still had no clue what he was doing and when I saw the ring I was gobsmacked.

'Me and Nikki thought we were just going to have a picture for the promotion so we both had no clue.

'I am over the moon with the proposal, I just can't believe he managed to keep it secret for so long.'

Ricky, a warehouse worker from Cradley Heath, West Midlands, added: 'Everything went perfectly, it really couldn't have gone any better, a draw was a fair result and both the girls said yes, it was just brilliant.

'Nikki was so shocked when she saw me
 on one knee with the ring, I had been planning it for months but she 
didn't have a clue, she was shaking and I was so happy she said yes.

'Everyone in my family and her family knew about it, I don't know how we managed to keep it from her but we did.

Ricky, who is used to public appearances in the ring, added that he had never been so nervous in his life.

'It is probably the most nerve-wracking thing I have had to do in my life, especially in front of that many people.'

Nikki, a full-time carer, said that she doesn't usually appreciate being put in the limelight but says she is very happy to be engaged.

'I don't usually like to be the centre of attention, I was so shocked and didn't know what he was doing on one knee. I can't believe they managed to keep it from me but it was great and I was so happy.

'We are just looking forward to the future now'

Promoter Pete Jackson, a former boxer of 15-years, said it is the first time in his career he had ever seen a proposal in the ring.

'I have been promoting fights for the past eight years and I currently manage 40 fighters, but I have never in my time seen anything like this.

'People were choked up in the crowd, it was a special moment and I don't expect to see something like that again.

'It was amazing, it really was and I am so proud to say I was a part of it.'
