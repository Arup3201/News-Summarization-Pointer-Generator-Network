The Duke and Duchess of Bedford have been accused of greed after entering tax avoidance schemes

An aristocrat Tory donor has been branded 'greedy' after investing in two tax avoidance schemes used by the wealthy to cut their bills.

The Duchess of Bedford, a director of Woburn Safari Park on the family’s country estate, is exploiting loopholes which allow people to write off 'losses' against tax, according to the Sunday Mirror.

Husband Andrew, the 15th Duke of Bedford, is reportedly worth £630million in art and property.

He and his wife have given £49,300 to the Conservatives and a company which lists the duke as a director has donated £69,500.

Documents reveal the duchess is a member of Cobalt Data Centre and Twofold First Services.

A financial expert said: 'It is interesting to see the Duchess on the list of members.

'You often associate them with the new money of footballers and celebrities rather than old aristocracy money.

'The Government has been critical of these schemes, yet the couple are Tory donors.'

High-profile figures including comic Jimmy Carr and footballer Wayne Rooney are also known to have joined such schemes.

The
duchess became a member of Twofold First Services on March 1, 2012. The
scheme takes advantage of farming tax reliefs and is run by a company 
based in the Cayman Islands. The Treasury branded it 'abusive' and 
'artificial'.

She joined 
Cobalt Data Centre 3 on April 3, 2011. It exploits enterprise zone perks
to give its 674 ­investors income tax relief at the top rate against 
the £264million cost of building a storage facility near Newcastle. 
Their £79million investment is topped up by a loan.

But members are entitled to tax relief on the full cost of the project'

Labour
MP and Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge said: 'It is
deeply depressing to find greedy individuals exploiting a perfectly 
proper Government objective to line their pockets.'

A
spokesman for the duchess said: 'Following professional advice, an 
investment was made in the two companies. In light of the concerns 
raised, these investments are being reviewed.'
