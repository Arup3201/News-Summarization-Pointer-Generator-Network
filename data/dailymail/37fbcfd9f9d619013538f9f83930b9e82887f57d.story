Sharing her experience: 52-year-old Robin Roberts' new memoir, about her battle with rare blood and bone marrow disease MDS, will hit shelves in April

Robin Roberts, 52, is penning a memoir about her recent battle with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which will be published in April 2014.

The Good Morning America co-host, who developed the rare blood and bone marrow disorder last year, underwent several sessions of chemotherapy and a marrow transplant from her sister Sally-Ann, before returning to the show in February.

'I am humbled that many have an interest, and draw strength from my ongoing journey,' said Ms Roberts in a statement.

'I'm grateful for the prayers and well wishes of so many people.'

The memoir, which will be sold in both print and audiobook forms, is as yet untitled.

It will chronicle Ms Roberts' battle with the disease, which forced her to take a five-month hiatus from the TV show.

Ms Roberts, who also fought and overcame breast cancer in 2007, has been vocal about her ordeal and recovery.

She hosted a series of reports on ABC News, entitled Robin's Journey, which chronicled her struggle with the disease and won a 2013 Peabody Award.

She is also credited with bringing myelodysplastic syndrome  into the public eye.

In
fact, on the day Ms Roberts announced her illness, Be the Match 
Registry, a nonprofit organization for bone marrow donations, reported a
1,800per cent spike in donors.

Ms Roberts, a Pass Christian, Mississippi native, began her career in television at ESPN Sportscenter, before joining ABC News in 1995, where she co-anchored Good Morning America for seven years.

This will be Ms Roberts' second book. Her 
first, From the Heart: Seven Rules to Live By, was published in 2007 and
was a New York Times bestseller.

Ms Roberts' memoir, which will be published by Hachette Book Group, will hit shelves in April 2014.
