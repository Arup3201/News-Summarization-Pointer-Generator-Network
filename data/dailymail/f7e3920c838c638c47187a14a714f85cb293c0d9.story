Katherine Jackson and her nephew TJ Jackson will move to share guardianship of Michael Jackson's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket, her lawyer said today.

The pair met last night in the company of lawyers to hash out an agreement over the care of the siblings, aged 10 to 15.

A judge granted Tito 
Jackson's son TJ temporary guardianship on Wednesday, citing 
concerns that Katherine was being prevented from fulfilling her role as guardian 'by a third party' following her days-long absence from the California home she shares with the children.

The 82-year-old had been at a Tucson, Arizona spa since 
July 15 with her daughter Rebbie and other relatives and had not spoken 
to her grandchildren during that time.

TJ Jackson and numerous others said that was unusual and when she did call, several days into her trip, she sounded 'strange.'

While appointing TJ temporary guardian of the children, Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said there were no indications 
Mrs Jackson had done anything wrong, and he would likely re-instate her 
as guardian upon her return.

However, Katherine's lawyer, Perry Sanders, released a statement today indicating TJ and Mrs Jackson had reached an agreement to share guardianship of the children that could be presented to a judge next week.

A statement from Mr Sanders reads: 'Later this morning, TJ Jackson's attorney, Charles Shultz, will be filing a petition for TJ to be appointed permanent guardian of Michael Jackson's three children.

'The court ordered that this petition be filed pursuant to the temporary guardianship he granted TJ on Wednesday of this week.

'However, after a very productive meeting yesterday, first between Mrs. Jackson and me, and then joined by Prince Jackson, TJ Jackson and Mr. Shultz, it was agreed by all that it is in the best interest of Mrs. Jackson and the children to file a modified joint pleading at the beginning of next week.'

Under the plan, responsibility for managing staff and 
security at the home would shift to TJ Jackson. Katherine Jackson would keep 
control of a family allowance worth tens of thousands of dollars a month, according to the lawyer.

Mr Sanders said Michael Jackson's eldest son has told attorneys he approves of the arrangement, which will relieve the matriarch of some of the day-to-day stresses of managing a famous family.

He continued: 'Mrs. Jackson is extremely pleased with the prospect of enjoying the pleasure of raising Michael's children without the day-to-day tedium of items such as managing the large staff that goes with such a high-profile family and focus her attention on being a grandmother and raising Michael's children," Sanders wrote in a statement.

'She
is eager to simply enjoy her great relationship with these children, 
while deeding over some of the stressors that go hand in hand with being
a guardian,' he wrote.

Court filings: A document shows TJ's appointment was approved by a judge on Wednesday

Katherine's
lawyer said last night that she is doing fine despite family squabbling
that forced a judge to temporarily suspend her guardianship.

Sanders Jr said: 'I am pleased to 
report that she is fine and she laughed at the widely publicised report 
that she had suffered a stroke.'Â 

The description of Jackson suffering a
stroke was included in a letter signed by five of her children calling 
on executors of Michael Jackson's estate to step down.

The letter was leaked last week and was an early sign of turmoil that was to come for the Jackson clan.

Since late Saturday when a relative reported Katherine Jackson missing, speculation has swirled about her whereabouts, her health and why she hadn't called her grandchildren for nearly 10 days.

Rival factions in the family released duelling statements on Twitter and family members tussled in the driveway of her home in an incident that remains under investigation.

The Jackson family turmoil rumbled 
yesterday, with Prince Jackson blasting family members for allegedly 
refusing him contact with his grandmother during her Arizona stay.

'Although I am happy my grandma was 
returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly
she was lied to,' Prince, 15, wrote in a posting on his Twitter 
account. 'I'm really angry and hurt.'

Hours later the post was deleted, but re-emerged by late afternoon, with the eldest son of Michael Jackson wondering if his account had been hacked.

The post was the first time Prince Jackson had publicly commented on his grandmother's absence.

The judge overseeing the guardianship of Prince, his sister Paris, 14, and brother blanket, ten, meanwhile said today he wants an independent investigation into their well-being.

Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff ordered an investigator to interview the three children independently and prepare a report that will be reviewed solely by him.

The order does not spell out a reason for the investigation, but it is likely intended to give the judge another perspective on how Jackson's children are coping after a week of family turmoil that has included the absence of their grandmother amid a feud over the estate of the pop superstar.

The court investigator was ordered to interview the children at school at a time to remain undisclosed.
