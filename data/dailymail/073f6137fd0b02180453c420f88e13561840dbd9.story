Hundreds of airline passengers have finally touched down in the U.S. after apparently being stuck on a tarmac in the Middle East for a staggering 12 hours without food or accurate information.

The fliers, who were heading to San Francisco International Airport, were left stranded onboard Etihad Airways Flight 183 after heavy fog delayed their takeoff at Abu Dhabi Airport on Saturday.

Every half an hour or so, they were reportedly assured the plane would shortly depart. However, 12 hours later, it remained on the tarmac, with passengers having been served no food.

During the wait, the fliers had also reportedly not received any accurate flight information, prompting a number of them to get into arguments with flight attendants, according to broadcaster KGO.

'They kept telling us that we were going to leave, you know 15 minutes from now, 20 minutes from now, 30 minutes for now, for 12 hours,' passenger Thomas Piani told ABC News.

Flier Venkatesh Pahwa added: 'Everybody was fighting with each other, and the flight attendants were fighting with us, and we were fighting with the flights attendants.'

With nothing else to do, many passengers took to social media to vent their frustration at the delay, complaining that they were hungry, sleep-deprived and never flying with Etihad again.

Ravali Reddy tweeted: 'Hey @EtihadAirways, I've been sitting on EY 183 in Abu Dhabi for 10 hours now. THIS IS NOT OK. There are kids and seniors on this flight.'

Frustrated: Ravali Reddy, who posted live updates of the enormous delay, tweeted: 'Every 30 min, we are told that we'll be departing in 45 min. This has happened for the PAST 10 HOURS. This is unacceptable'

Comparison: She later said she was not allowed to get off and compared the flight to an episode of Seinfeld

Another irritated customer: Mittal Parekh, also onboard Flight 183, added: 'Hey @EtihadAiraways Pl explain - why keep us all locked in ur World ranking tube for 12 hrs on tarmac just feets away from the terminal?'

She later compared the experience to an episode of Seinfeld, writing: 'Stuck in an @EtihadAirways flight on the ground for 10+ hours. And not allowed to get off. I feel like I'm in a Seinfeld episode.'

Meanwhile, nine hours through the reported 12-hour wait, a female passenger named Sujatha tweeted: 'EY183 on runway for 9 hours. Terrible service and crew won't serve food.'

Newlywed Navin Varma, who described the overall journey as the 'flight from hell', added: '12hrs of sitting on the tarmac as newlyweds bringing my wife on her first trip to the USA. Horrifying.'

After the plane finally took off, passengers - including dozens children and pensioners - were forced to make the 16-hour flight to their destination - meaning they spent a total of 28 hours on the plane.

They were met at San Francisco International Airport at 6.30pm on Saturday by their concerned relatives, some of whom were worried that something disastrous had happened to the flight.

Anita Nariani, who was waiting at the airport for her 77-year-old mother, Leela Nariani, said: 'To have them just waiting, especially if they are seniors traveling on it, they've gotta pull them.'

Other relatives added that they were unable to contact anyone at the airline to discuss the situation.

Passengers later told reporters that the flight crew had said they must remain on the plane at Abu Dhabi because the airport was too crowded with other stranded flights to allow them to get off to wait.

Etihad, a national airline of the United Arab Emirates, which includes Abu Dhabi, said in a statement on its website that fog had delayed flights and caused airport congestion.

The airline apologized for travelers' inconvenience but said the delays were beyond its control.

A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Etihad Airways has apologised to passengers  for the significant delay they experienced during the unprecedented fog disruption at Abu Dhabi Airport.

'During the time on the ground, awaiting permission to take-off, passengers were provided with refreshments and were updated about the reasons for the rolling delay caused by the extreme weather conditions.

Delay: Girl Lilikoi, who was on a different delayed flight, tweeted: 'It has been 6hrs and we are still stranded'

'Passengers remained on the aircraft as all efforts were being made to secure a new departure time. The delay was then compounded by the requirement to replace the aircraft’s ultra-long haul operating crew who had exceeded their flight time limitations.

'Etihad Airways always strives to deliver the highest standards of customer service and on this occasion our ability to do so was impacted by circumstances  largely beyond our control.' 

It is believed that 'normal change or cancellation fees' will be waived for affected passengers.
