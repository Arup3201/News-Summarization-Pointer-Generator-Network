Glenn Hoddle is set to be appointed to Queens Park Rangers’ backroom team as Harry Redknapp looks to implement a 3-5-2 formation.

The former England manager could make a dramatic return to football at Loftus Road this week after productive talks with Redknapp on Friday night.

Redknapp, who played a 4-4-2 system last season, wants to replicate Louis van Gaal’s 3-5-2 formation during the forthcoming campaign. And the QPR manager wants Hoddle, who is well versed at playing with three at the back, to play a lead role in the transition.

Hoddle used the formation during his managerial spells at Swindon and Chelsea, and also deployed the system intermittently during his time with England. The former Tottenham manager even played as a sweeper during the closing stages of his career.

The switch is expected to see Rio Ferdinand play as a sweeper with Steven Caulker and Clint Hill flanking the former England star.

Even though Hoddle hasn’t coached for eight years — since he left Wolves — the 56-year-old has made no secret of the fact that he wants to get back into football. He was linked with a return to White Hart Lane following Andre Villas-Boas’s sacking last season, but Daniel Levy handed the reins to Tim Sherwood. 

To keep his hand in, Hoddle has set up an academy to develop talented youngsters, as well as working as a television pundit for Sky Sports and ITV.

But he is poised to accept a role that will see him return to football on a day-to-day basis, working alongside Redknapp, Kevin Bond and Joe Jordan. Hoddle will be permitted to continue his punditry work as long as it does not conflict with club duties and he will be allowed to leave Loftus Road should a desired management role crop up.

Redknapp has been looking for a new coach since Steve McClaren’s departure for Derby midway through last season.

Ferdinand’s ability on the ball will be vital to QPR’s transition to a new formation. Hoddle worked with him during his time with England, giving the 35-year-old his full international debut in 1997.

The 3-5-2 formation is set to make a comeback with Glenn Hoddle at QPR to implement the system he helped popularise in the 1990s.

Hoddle used the formation for England’s 1998 World Cup campaign, having tested it out while manager of Chelsea.

At Loftus Road, Rio Ferdinand will play the sweeper role that Hoddle had in mind when signing Ruud Gullit at Stamford Bridge in 1995.

Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United revolution will also showcase the system, as he used it to guide Holland to third place at this summer’s World Cup finals in Brazil.

Top-level football is saturated with teams playing 4-2-3-1, so playing three at the back allows a side to outnumber the opposition forwards and go man-for-man in midfield while possessing the added attacking threat of two men up front.

Width is provided from two wing backs who must be able to contribute in both halves, with United’s signing of Luke Shaw seeing the teenager pencilled into the left-sided role at Old Trafford.

New signing Mauricio Isla, who has arrived on a season-long loan from Juventus, is expect to fill the right wing-back slot and former Arsenal defender Armand Traore is the leading contender to play left wing-back. 

Redknapp still hopes to strengthen his squad before next weekend’s opener against Hull. He wants a defensive midfielder and the club have explored a potential deal for West Ham’s Momo Diame. Redknapp is also interested in former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Lassana Diarra, who is currently at Lokomotiv Moscow.

Meanwhile, Redknapp is increasingly confident of keeping Loic Remy, who had looked certain to leave Loftus Road this summer after his impressive loan spell at Newcastle last season.

But the France striker has seen moves to Arsenal and Liverpool fall through, raising Redknapp’s hopes that Remy, who also interests Tottenham, can play a role for him next season.
