Each of the objects filling every spare bit of space in the room tells a story. They’re all snapshots in the long life of Tony Benn.

When Benn, 88, moved into sheltered accommodation from the house in Holland Park, London, where he had lived for decades, he was determined to take as many mementoes as possible to his new home.

He’s surrounded here by an amazingly eclectic selection — from busts of Marx and Lenin to pictures of his four children and his grandchildren, who no doubt supplied the helium Get Well Soon balloon on the bookshelf and the charming drawing on the table. Pictures and a bust of his beloved American-born late wife Caroline take pride of place.

Each of the objects filling every spare bit of space in the room tells a story. They're all snapshots in the long life of Tony Benn

From his 60 years on the political frontline are recollections of Benn’s time in Government, both as Postmaster General and Minister of Technology in the early days of Concorde and beginnings of North Sea Oil, and hilarious models of Labour leaders.

The bookshelves include the originals of his diaries. Benn has kept a daily diary since 1963, and as the final volume is published, he opened his home to the Mail . . .

Tony Benn plays Connect 4 occasionally with a friend, Kathleen, who helps him in his flat

Behind the chair on the grate is the children’s game, Connect 4, which Tony Benn plays occasionally with a friend, Kathleen, who helps him in his flat. The rules of the game say players have to get four counters in a row to win

This photograph is of Benn with his wife, Caroline, in December 1964, shortly after an election victory

This joyous photograph of the Benns was taken in December 1964, shortly after the Labour general election victory. The two cups next to the bust of Lenin are golfing trophies from 1929 and 1951, whose origin is lost in the mists of time. Tony Benn doesn’t  play golf — but he is  a student of the  Russian Revolution

Figures of Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown

They were Labour leaders, but you may struggle to identify them from these models bought at the House of Commons souvenir shop. Gordon Brown, right, is barely recognisable. The others, from left, are Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, and Tony Blair

Benn counts this Boris Yeltsin doll (left) and this 'clapperboard' made to celebrate a Benn documentary

Left, inside the Russian doll of Boris Yeltsin (President of Russia from 1991 to 1999) are a series of other Russian leaders dating right back to the last Tsar, Nicholas II, assassinated in 1918

This ‘clapperboard’ was on a cake made earlier this year to celebrate Will And Testament, a documentary about Benn that records the highlights of his extraordinary political life

On Benn's mantelpiece is this model Big Ben with a pipe incorporated

In 1992, Benn was awarded the Pipesmoker Of The Year trophy — aptly, a model of the tower of Big Ben which incorporated  a pipe

Benn met Mahatma Gandhi when he was six years old in 1931

The cardboard cut-out of Mahatma Gandhi recalls the day in 1931 a six-year-old Tony Benn met the Indian independence  leader when Gandhi was in London for political talks. Benn’s father, Viscount Stansgate, was Secretary of State for India from 1929 to 1931

Benn keeps this bust of his wife, Caroline, which was completed in 1999 - shortly before she died

The bust of Benn’s wife, Caroline, completed in 1999, a year before her death, is on a chair once owned by the first Labour leader, Keir Hardie, whose biography she wrote

Left is a picture of Benn with his daughter, Melissa, and granddaughter, Hannah

This memorial plate, given to Benn by the Kent Area National Union of Mineworkers, sits on his busy shelf

Tony Benn acquired this miners’ strike memorial plate when he visited the Kent Area National Union of Mineworkers during the 1984-1985 dispute. Benn supported the strike and controversial NUM leader, Arthur Scargill, in what would be one of  the defining industrial showdowns of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership

Benn started writing his diary, bound here, 50 years ago

These ring-binders, containing the original typed copies of his diaries, start in 1963, when Benn won his fight to disclaim his hereditary peerage. The extensive diaries have been published in nine volumes so far

And objects obscured in the main picture...

The former Minister of Technology was on the first British test flight of this Concorde in April 1969

The Concorde model recalls Tony Benn’s time as Minister of Technology. He was on the first British test flight of the plane on April 9, 1969, and said then: ‘I must say that when it took off the vibration made me feel I was being filleted, my skin falling off my skeleton!’ Behind the model is a bottle of North Sea oil, presented to him at the time before production started

This Karl Marx bust (right) is flanked by two miners lamps, while this postbox commemorates Benn's time as Postmaster-General in the 1960s

Left, this model postbox recognises Benn’s time as  Postmaster-General from 1964 to 1966

A bust of Karl Marx — surely one of the few occasions when the father of communisim shares a room with the likes of Tony Blair
