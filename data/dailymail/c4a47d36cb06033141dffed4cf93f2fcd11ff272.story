The shopkeeper who inspired Ronnie Barker’s Arkwright character in the sitcom Open All Hours has died, his daughter revealed today.

Dedicated Brian Meecham stocked everything from carbolic soap to homemade ice-cream.

He ran Meecham & Sons in Crewkerne, Somerset, from 1965 until his retirement in 1998, becoming renowned for the lengths he would go to for his loyal customers.

The community stalwart passed away last week at the age of 78 after suffering from heart and kidney problems.

But he has been immortalised by comedian Ronnie Barker who used Brian and his grocery store as an inspiration for the 1970s' sitcom Open All Hours.

Barker, who died in 2005, had a holiday home in nearby Beaminster and would often shop at Meecham and Son to buy Bull’s Sweets.

He was so impressed with the store’s 
layout that he replicated it for his shop in Open All Hours, which was 
based in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

The show became a nationwide hit and turned Mr Meecham into a local celebrity legend with residents nicknaming him Arkwright

The show, which co-starred David Jason, became a nationwide hit and turned Mr Meecham into a Crewkerne celebrity legend with locals nicknaming him Arkwright.

Mr Meecham and his wife Doreen, 76, would often perform improvised impressions of miserly Arkwright and his busty fiancee, nurse Gladys Emanuel, in front of amused customers.

He took over the store from his father George who had first opened the doors in 1928 - running it until his death in 1965 at the age of 90.

After retiring in 1998, great-grandfather Brian converted the shop into a sitting room, and lived out his years on the premises with Doreen.

His youngest daughter, Debra Spurway, 48, said: 'My father was born in the shop and it was always his plan to die there too.

'He would say "I came in to the world headfirst here so I want to go out feet first’.

'We were hoping to get him back from hospital so he could pass away at home but unfortunately he died a few hours before.

'He loved Ronnie Barker and was known to make people laugh, entertaining customers every day in his shop.

'There was nothing he couldn’t get for people in the days he ran the shop.

'He would go out in his van and deliver goods to people in other villages - everything from home-cooked ham to buckets.

'Since his death, we’ve been inundated with messages from people we didn’t know saying how much they will miss him.'

Mr Meecham will be returned to the store one more time on Thursday morning before he is transported to St Bartholomew Church in Crewkerne for the 11am service.
