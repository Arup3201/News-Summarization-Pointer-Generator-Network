A professional model gets paid £500 a shoot to appear on television screens, on billboards and in magazines every day - no, we're not talking about Cara Delevingne or Kate Moss. In fact, despite working for some of the biggest brands in the world, you’ve never even seen her face, until now.

Nicki Donohoe is a hand, foot and leg model and is in high demand from companies who want the perfect legs or elegant fingers to advertise their product.

Nicki from Sheffield, Yorks, appears on our screens everyday as the iconic legs running up the stairs in the Emmerdale credits, has ulcer-ridden toes in the intro to Embarrassing Bodies and it's her hands that squeeze the Febreeze bottle in national adverts.

Revealed: Nicki Donohoe is a hand, foot and leg model and works for some of the biggest brands in the UK - and now she's revealed her face

The 37-year-old has to go to extra lengths to protect her assets so wears gloves when she leaves the house and moisturises her hands and feet up to ten-times a day to keep her fingers and toes in tip-top condition.

Nicki, who is signed with Source Models, has been making her living from her limbs for five years after somebody suggested she went for a hand photo shoot.

Nicki said: 'I used to work as a make-up artist but people would always comment that I had pretty hands.

'Now I earn my wages from my body part modelling and its the hardest work of any job I’ve ever had.

'You have to contort your hands and feet into uncomfortable shapes to make them look beautiful and natural. Sometimes after a shoot I ache for days.'

Have you ever spotted her limbs? Nicki appears on our screens everyday as the iconic legs running up the stairs in the Emmerdale credits, has ulcer-ridden toes in the intro to Embarrassing Bodies and squeezes Febreeze in national adverts - and can earn £500 a shoot

Protecting her assets: The 37-year-old wears gloves when she leaves the house and moisturises her hands and feet up to ten-times a day to keep her fingers and toes in tip-top condition for her shoots

How she made it: Nicki has been making her living from her limbs for five years after somebody suggested she went for a hand photo shoot - she's never looked back

Nicki, who has done shoots for Aldi, Quorn and live shopping channels, has modelled products from tights to nail products and luxury jewellery.

Nicki said: 'I always have to look after my hands, even when I’m on holiday, I’ll be sunbathing on the beach with my little cotton gloves on.

'It looks ridiculous but if I got even one sun-spot it could affect my career, it’s like a workman looking after his tools. I have a special lotion of almond oil and salt I use to look after my skin - and I go to the gym to ensure my legs are always toned.

It's not all glamour! She says she often has to contort her hands and feet into uncomfortable shapes to make them look beautiful and natural and will often ache for days after a shoot

Healthy lifestyle: She doesn't smoke - essential for hand models and avoiding alcohol, caffeine and chocolate is important, she says

'If I cut my hand or chipped a nail it could cost me a job, I’ve always got to be careful.'

Nicki, who does around two body part modelling jobs a week, travels around the country to shoot locations and has even appeared on television around the world.

Nicki said: 'Luckily I was blessed with quite strong nails but I do think a good diet helps, although I’ve never eaten meat or fish, I do have a diet rich in nuts and salad.

'I don’t smoke - essential for hand models and avoiding alcohol, caffeine and chocolate is important as you need to keep your hands so still and for hours upon hours usually on set - no shaking, it’s a real skill.

'It’s a career that you have to take seriously, and be prepared to change little things that you do as it could affect your work.'
