Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has revealed Cristiano Ronaldo was left on the bench because he was too tired to start against Atletico Madrid.

Ronaldo had to wait until the 63rd minute to make an appearance, but his presence was not enough to stop Ancelotti’s side from crashing out of the cup.

Ancelotti admitted after the 2-0 defeat that the Portuguese maestro was slightly fatigued, which is why he was rested for the last-16 first-leg game.

"Cristiano was a little bit tired and he might have suffered during the match," said the Italian coach after Los Blancos suffered their third successive defeat.

The Spanish giants are without a win in 2015 following defeats to AC Milan, Valencia and Atletico Madrid and now face an uphill battle to qualify for the next round.

But Ancelotti was quick to refute the suggestion that his team was in crisis, he said: "I think to say crisis is a bit exaggerated, but we have not been happy with the last two matches. 

"We have to win again quickly. "There is still 90 minutes to play in the tie. We do not have much chance of progressing, but we will try with all our strength."
