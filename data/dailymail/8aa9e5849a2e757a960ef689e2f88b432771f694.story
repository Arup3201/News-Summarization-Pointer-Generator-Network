Textbooks are dying out in classrooms because teachers see them as 'regimented and old-fashioned', Elizabeth Truss said yesterday.

The Education Minister said rampant ideology in schools that teaching should be 'unstructured and free-flow' meant just one in ten ten-year-olds are issued with them now.

Among 14-year-olds studying science the figure falls to an astonishing eight per cent - one in 12.

Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said children's education is being harmed as teachers are making up their own materials instead of using textbooks

The 'anti-textbook orthodoxy' is damaging children's education as they are coming home with 'dog-eared worksheets' that give them no sense of the context of what they are learning.

Some teachers of 'essentially writing their own materials' by collecting vast amounts of 'different worksheets and bits and pieces of paper', she added.

Ms Truss was reacting to figures which showed the UK had the lowest use of textbooks out of 50 nations in a survey

Unions dismissed the claims yesterday, saying constant 'meddling' in education meant schools were reluctant to invest in books.

But education experts said the practice was driven by Left-wing ideology which allowed teachers to pursue their own agenda.

The data was buried in a report last year by the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement showed England has the lowest use of textbooks among the 50 nations that were surveyed.

They are used by 99 per cent of teachers in South Korea, 86 per cent in Germany and 78 per cent in Poland - all of which outperform England academically.

'This country has fallen out of love with the textbook. They are perhaps seen as regimented and old-fashioned,' she said in a speech to the British Educational Suppliers Association.

'I know many frustrated parents who have found bits of worksheets covered in orange juice at the bottom of their child's school bag.

'Why not have a good textbook that can help lead the parent and the child through the learning of the course?'

She added: 'I think it's partly down to issues of ideology and education philosophy... child-centred learning. The idea that there is not a best way to teach something, that actually it should be unstructured and free-flow.'

Official textbooks give pupils 'a sense of ownership over what they are studying' and allow them to 'catch up or read ahead or study core concepts on their own', she argued.

And the failure to provide children with a book that acts as a 'map or guide' is creating a 'free-for-all' that is handing an advantage to England's international rivals.

'High-performing countries are creating great textbooks and make sure children flourish only if they understand essential concepts and knowledge,' Miss Truss said.

'In Shanghai, textbooks are a given. In [South] Korea they've got a programme where they're introducing digital books.

South Korea, Poland and Germany all used more textbooks and rank above England academically

They use multimedia content, animations, virtual reality - all of which can be altered to fit each student's ability level. But the actual material is the same.

'The principle of a good textbook is as important as ever - a structured progression through essential knowledge.'

Chris Keates, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, claimed other countries benefited from 'stability' in their education systems.

'They can invest in textbooks and plan for the future with confidence. Schools in England suffer constant change, meddling and interference in the curriculum,' she said.

But Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said: 'Textbooks give structure to learning but if you have an alternative agenda they are not always the best vehicle for that.

'The decline in textbooks has been pretty disastrous. Children are suffering from death by a thousand worksheets.'
