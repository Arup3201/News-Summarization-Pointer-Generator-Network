Bureaucrats charged with bringing down obesity levels in America have cost taxpayers millions of dollars to upgrade their plane seats because they are too fat to fly in coach.

Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services took 7,000 first and business class flights between 2009 and 2013, figures from the General Services Administration reveal.

Almost three quarters of these premium tickets, which cost taxpayers a total of $31million, were justified as 'medical exemptions'.

This could mean the passenger was suffering from back pain, circulation issues, or was too fat to fit in coach seats, among other reasons.

Figures obtained by the Washington Examiner showed that for 253 of these trips a one-way ticket cost more than $15,000. 

The data also showed HHS bosses booked more premium tickets than any other federal agency.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention booked the second highest number of premium seats, though their total came to just 3,000, less than half the HSS total.

Other reasons given for the bookings were 'exceptional security circumstances,' no coach tickets being available, and that first or business class was 'required because of agency mission.'

Federal employees are allowed to fly business or first class if their flight is longer than 14 hours, but only 1,400 of the 7,000 HHS flights met that criteria.

The numbers will be particularly galling as the Department of Health and Human Services is charged with 'protecting the health of all Americans', including tackling obesity.

According to its own website, one of its keys goals is to 'help Americans achieve and maintain a healthy weight,' in part by promoting healthy choices in the workplace.

They aim to become 'a model healthy workplace', while also investing in grants that promote healthy living in other offices.

In September, the agency announced $212million in funding to battle diseases, including obesity.

A spokesman for HHS told the New York Post: 'If someone is obese and too large for a seat, the doctor can put in a request.

'It’s not a rubber stamp approval. It’s not as easy as, "My back hurts and I have a doctor’s note."'
