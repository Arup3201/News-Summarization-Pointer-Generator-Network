A father-of-six has come up with a novel way of raising spirits for mourners at his funeral - by buying himself a coffin built in the shape of a giant Jack Daniels bottle.

Former soldier Anto Wickham started planning his own funeral after seeing eight Army pals killed during the Iraq war.

The 48-year-old, from Belfast, paid a Nottingham-based firm £3,000 for the ten-foot high replica of a bottle of his favourite tipple.

Mr Wickham commissioned the bespoke coffin based on his favourite drink when he decided his funeral needed to be a celebration of his life

Mr Wickham, who spent 22 years with the Royal Irish Regiment, said: 'While working in Iraq after I had a very close call.

'Over a 28-day period in February 2007 I was attacked 74 times and there were some days we would get three or four hits in one day.

'I was attacked by heavy machine gun fire, IEDs and roadside bombs.

'I lost eight colleagues. At the time I thought I would have to plan my funeral because something could go wrong.

'I didn't want a normal funeral and it had to be a celebration of life because I have been to too many funerals of colleagues where they were very sad occasions.

'I wanted something completely different and I decided my favourite drink is Jack Daniels.

'It just happened when I was at home on leave I saw an Alan Titchmarsh programme and I found the company.

'I asked 
would it be possible to make it and the answer was yes. My friends see 
the funny side of it, but mum and my grandparents are not too 
impressed.'

Mr
 Wickham jetted over from Afghanistan, where he is working as a private 
security guard, this week to take a first glimpse at his novelty buy.

He said: 'It is absolutely fantastic. When I opened it I could not believe the detail and the artwork.

'They have done a fantastic job. It is just amazing. It was strange getting into it.

'My headstone is going to have a solar-panelled iPad. I plan to leave a video message with pictures of the coffin from start to finish.

'I am also going to approach Guinness to see if they will take me to the service in one of their delivery vans.

'I have even planned my music. I will be coming in to Sid Vicious from the Sex Pistols singing 'My Way' because I am doing everything my way and always have done.'

The team that built the coffin spent hours doing the signwriting and creating the right curves of the bottle

His unique coffin is not the only unusual trick Mr Wickham is planning for his funeral. He also plans to ask Guinness if it will take his body to the service in one of its delivery vans and he will play 'My Way' by Sid Vicious

John Gill helped set up Crazy Coffins ten years ago after a string of unusual requests from customers.

Mr Gill, a coffin maker of 25 years, said: 'It all started when someone knocked at the door asking for an aeroplane coffin.

'It never crossed our mind that coffin makers did this before that. We have done canal boats and mobile phones and each request seems more bizarre.

'This design was very complicated because there are so many curves in a Jack Daniels bottle and it is almost cut like a diamond.

'We have never had to do so much sign-writing before either. We built it bit by bit because the man was fighting fit and healthy so we knew there was no rush.'
