Nottingham has beaten off Manchester and Portsmouth to win the right to stage a £1.6million, two-year pilot project aimed at testing ways of getting more people playing football regularly.

The Football Association had £1.6m of public funding for the amateur game cut by Sport England in March after failing to reverse a decline in participation - last year there were 1.84 million people playing football regularly, a fall of 100,000 since April 2013.

And in a new funding initiative, Nottingham has been named as Sport England's City of Football, beating Manchester and Portsmouth.

Sport England's City of Football initiative is aimed at  getting more people playing football regularly

The City of Football project encourages the participation of young people at grassroots level 

Nottingham has two sides in the Football League, with Nottingham Forest currently top of the Chamionship

Notts County are the other Football League club in Nottingham, and they sit 14th in League One

The city has a rich football heritage, and Nottingham Forest won the European Cup in 1979 and 1980 under Brian Clough (pictured)

A statement from Sport England said Nottingham clinched their bid 'by mobilising an impressive group of private, public and voluntary sector partners from both inside and outside the traditional football family, to do whatever it takes to get more people - particularly those aged 14-25 years - playing all kinds of football regularly.'

One key element is a digital platform - 'Playbook' - which will help people planning football activities in Nottingham being able target a sector of the population with relevant offers.

Nigel Cooke, head of One Nottingham, said: 'Over the next two years, we will create new football partnerships; develop new technologies; encourage more people to play, especially 14 to 25 year olds, women and girls and people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds; and share our learning so that the rest of England can benefit from our insight.'
