Most homeowners hit by flooding are faced with just two options - clean up and hope it doesn't happen again, or move out.

But one determined couple whose island home was wrecked when the Thames burst its banks last year have come up with a new idea - shifting their five-bedroom house 5ft into the air.

Yaron Ivry and his wife Sigal have spent almost £80,000 jacking  their riverside property in Wraysbury, Berkshire, up onto stilts, and filling in the gap with breeze blocks.

Yaron Ivry and his wife Sigal (pictured together) spent almost £80,000 jacking their Thameside property in Wraysbury, Berkshire, up by five feet to prevent it from a repeat of last year's winter flooding. Here the house is seen in its finished state, having been put on stilts and the new basement underneath the property bricked up

Over the course of ten days, a team of engineers lifted the 80-ton building up into the air, using a steel cradle and 28 computerised jacks which pushed the house upwards at a rate of three inches an hour.

Now, a year after the house was devastated by floods last January, work is complete with the house protected from the waters of the Thames, and the Ivry family enjoying a new basement underneath their home, as well as a new kitchen, replacing the one which was left underwater when the river breached its banks.

'It's fantastic,' Mr Ivry, 59, told MailOnline. 'It's great. We are back in the house now and the work is almost all done.

'There is still some work inside but it's nearly there.

'We have created a new basement under the house in the space where the stilts are and that will be useful for storage and we have a new kitchen.

'It is better than we could have ever imagined, with under floor heating, and a better view out over the river.

Mr Ivry hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift. Holes were bored into the brick walls, shown here, so supportive beams could put up both inside and outside the building

28 super-strong jacks — each capable of supporting 50 tons — were placed underneath the steel cradle. A diamond-edged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors, severing the building from its foundations

'Every day I look out of the window and I smile and feel happy because I am safe.' 

Mr Ivry, a former engineer and owner of telecommunications business D-Mobile, his wife, 49, their 17-year-old daughter Ayala, and dog Prince live on an island between the River Thames and an artificial water channel, which left them vulnerable to flooding.

When water poured into their home last January it caused £125,000 in damage, with the house's hardwood floor, ground floor walls and electrics wrecked beyond repair.

As the rain poured down, Mr Ivry's garden was left underwater and even though he tried to set up barricades at his garage and front door, he was unable to stop the water gushing in, leaving the ground floor under nearly half a foot.

'We are sitting on an island, so when the water comes up it comes from all sides,' he said.

'When we were flooded we were an island surrounded 360 degrees by water.

'It was devastating.' 

The self-employed couple lost a year of business because they could no longer work from their home.

Mrs Ivry, who runs a jewellery distribution company, said: 'I was hoping right up until the last minute we would not have to move.

'We thought maybe we could stay and live upstairs, but after a day we realised it was not realistic, when the smell starts.

The windows and walls of the home were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains, and work began to lift the house slowly into the air - with the family's belongings still inside. Work to lift the house began after planning permission was granted last June

With the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the hydraulic jacks (pictured), no one part of the building was exposed to particular stress as it was lifted from the ground at a rate of three inches an hour

'The house became all humid and stinking - it was not healthy.' 

The value of the house - which had been worth £1 million - dropped to £750,000 as it could not be insured against future floods.

Now, after the £80,000 project the house is thought to be worth between £1.5 million and £2 million.

'My view was that if I did nothing it would end up costing me and I would lose a lot of value on the house because I could not insure it,' he said.

'But if I did something, if I put in £80,000 to save the house, I would definitely get it back if I did decide to sell it.

'Plus I could insure the house and I could live in it safely.'

Father-of-three Mr Ivry had considered sealing the house with a barrier, waterproof doors and pumps to get rid of any ground water or leakage, but worried that just one tiny crack would mean water pouring into his home again. 

'I could have spent £35,000 and I wouldn't know if it would even work,' he said.  

He also considered demolishing the house completely.

The value of the house - which had been worth £1 million - dropped to £750,000 as it could not be insured against future floods. Now, after the £80,000 project the house is thought to be worth between £1.5 million and £2 million. It took ten days to lift the house to its agreed height

'It would have cost me maybe £400,000 to rebuild it , and I would need to find somewhere else to live,' he said.

'So I took up the challenge of lifting it and researching on the internet I saw that it had been done with a concert hall in Shanghai.

'People were sceptical and wanted to see if it would work, but I knew that if it was done properly it then the risk would be almost nothing.' 

After getting permission from the local council, Mr Ivry hired specialist builders who created a network of steel beams under the house which would hold its weight as the property began to lift. 

Holes were bored into the brick walls and supportive beams put up both inside and outside the building.

Then, 28 super-strong jacks — each capable of supporting 50 tons — were placed underneath the steel cradle. A diamond-edged saw then sliced horizontally through all the brick walls below the level of the concrete floors, severing the building from its foundations.

With the perimeter ring of steel steadying the structure and pressure spread evenly over the jacks, no single part of the building was exposed to particular stress as it was raised.

Finally, all the windows and walls were braced with timber beams to help ease any internal strains, and work began to lift the house slowly into the air with the family's belongings still inside, although they moved out into a rented flat nearby.

The newly-formed gap at the bottom of the house was then filled with breeze blocks, and the steel cradle removed before the breeze block basement was concealed with reclaimed London yellow bricks, designed to match the rest of the house.

Mr Ivry's newly-raised front door now has a long staircase leading up to it, protecting the entrance to the house from any flood water

Around the back of the family's house, two former patio doors will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues. The family were able to move back into their home in October

The couple say the transformation is 'unbelievable', and their higher home means they enjoy a better view of the river

His front door now has a long staircase leading up to it and around the back of his house two former patio doors, which are now suspended from mid air, will soon become a raised decking area for barbecues. 

Work on the main structure was completed in August, and the family were able to move back in last October.  

Mr Ivry's home, which the family have lived in since 1998, is thought to be the first in Britain to have been lifted in this way, and he has been visited by officers from the Environment Agency eager to learn from his project.

His neighbours, many of whom were forced to leave their homes in last January's floods, have also turned to him for advice on how to protect their own homes from any future damage.  

'2014 was total chaos,' said Mr Ivry.

'I could not work, by wife could not work and we were out of our home. 

'Now 2014 is behind us and we are looking forward to the future. 

'We are so happy that we have done it and the house is unbelievable.'

As the rain poured down, Mr Ivry's garden was left underwater and even though he tried to set up barricades at his garage and front door, he was unable to stop it gushing in. The house was badly hit by last year's floods, with the hardwood floor, ground floor walls and electrics wrecked beyond repair
