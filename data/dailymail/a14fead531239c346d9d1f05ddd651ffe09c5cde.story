Killed: 8-month-old Angeles Paredes was tragically crushed by a lamppost in a freak accident Tuesday in West New York, New Jersey

Freak accident: While Angela's mother pushed her stroller down the street, a bus careened into a nearby lamppost which then fell on Angela, killing her

Lost: Angela's mother's screams were heard by residents as high as 21 stories above the scene of the accident in West New York, New Jersey

Juan Navarrrete said he heard the crash and the mother’s screams from his 21st floor apartment. As he rushed down to help, he watched as Officer Michael Stetson administered CPR on the bloodied infant.

‘That officer worked so hard,’ Navarrrete told the Jersey Journal. ‘He was trying to keep her alive.’Stetson said the baby had no pulse when he arrived and began the resuscitation efforts. And they very nearly worked.

‘After CPR, she was gasping every third breath,’ said Stetson, a father of three himself.As Naverrete watched the calamity unfold, he said he broke down.

Cause unknown: The cause of the accident is unknown and Angela was the only casualty. A witness said the bus dropped off passengers and then suddenly sped off before crashing into the light post and a nearby car

'He was trying to keep her alive': An officer on the scene administered CPR and had Angela breathing again, if only briefly. 'That officer worked so hard,' said witness Juan Navarrrete

'After CPR, she was gasping every third breath': The baby's mother, Maylin Hogo (pictured), screamed hysterically as Officer Michael Stetson arrived and tried desperately to save the bleeding child

‘You don't know the person, but that's a human being,’ he told Jersey Journal. ‘I really cried over there.’

Witness Jose Serra said he watched as the bus dropped off passengers and then seemed to suddenly speed out of control, hitting a parked car after crashing into the lamppost and creating a chain reaction.

Four people from one of the parked cars were taken away to be treated for minor injuries.The grieving mother and bus driver were both taken to Jersey City Medical Center in neck braces, along with the child.

Sad: The grieving mother, her baby, and the driver of the bus were taken to Jersey City Medical Center

'It's a human tragedy': West New York Mayor Felix Roque spoke to reporters on the scene 'It's sad.'

Speaking through hospital officials, Angela’s father Jairo Paredes and the rest of her family declined to speak to the press, reports the Jersey Journal.

The vehicle was operated by Sphinx Transportation, which provides shuttle service between New Jersey and New York City, just across the Hudson River from West New York.

A woman who answered the telephone at the Sphinx offices in Ridgefield told The Associated Press the company had no idea what caused the accident, and that the driver had been hospitalized. The woman declined to be identified.

Distraught: Angela's mother was unhurt, though she was taken from the scene in a neck brace. The family, including father Jairo Paredes (right) declined to speak to reporters Tuesday

No comment: The driver of the bus is now being questioned by authorities. An employee of the bus company--Sphinx, which runs between New York and New Jersey--declined to comment

Hudson County Sheriff Frank Schillari said driver distraction, along with speed, may have been factors in the crash.

Schillari said his office is working with the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office Homicide Unit to investigate the cause of the tragedy. The 48-year-old driver is in stable condition and is being questioned under guard.

West New York Mayor Felix Roque was on the scene and spoke to reporters.

‘It's a human tragedy to have this kind of event in West New York,’ he said. ‘It's sad.’
