It used to be a sign of a man behaving badly. But coming home with a broken nose after a big night out seems to be a rising risk among women as well.

A study of English hospitals found that the number of young women having their noses reset rose almost nine-fold in seven years.

The rise of ladette culture, in which young women think nothing of engaging in the heavy drinking sessions and bad behaviour once the preserve of males, could be partly to blame.

The researchers looked at nose operations carried out at hospitals in Bath, Luton and Stevenage over seven years and analysed them by age and gender.

Some 537 girls and women had their noses reset between 2002 and 2009 – meaning females accounted for about a quarter of such operations. The sharpest rise among all patient groups was in girls and women aged between 13 and 20.

In 2002, there were just four operations in that age group, but by 2009 the figure had shot up to 33.

As many people with broken noses do not have operations, the true number of breaks is likely to be even higher.

Case notes at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital showed that some of the fractures were caused by domestic violence, sports injuries and traffic accidents.

However, three-quarters were attributed to other types of accidents and non-domestic violence.

Researcher Aaron Trinidade said this could include alcohol-fuelled fights, brawls and falls, as well as women and girls drunkenly walking into lampposts and  other objects.

Writing in the Journal of Laryngology and Otology, he said: ‘The cause may be multi-factorial but could be partially attributed to a rise in ladette culture.’

Dr Trinidade, who carried out the analysis while working at the ear, nose and throat department of Luton and Dunstable Hospital, said the rise of broken noses in the 13 to 20 age group was ‘particularly interesting’.

‘Other research has shown that there has been a rise in the amount of young people in this age group seeking specialist help for substance abuse, including alcohol, many aged 12 or less,’ he said.

‘In addition, alcohol-related anti-social behaviour has also been shown to be rising.’

The charity Drinkaware warns that alcohol can trigger ‘booze-fuelled barneys’ by altering mood and lowering inhibitions.

Dr Trinidade, who now works at Ipswich Hospital, said that although he studied only three hospitals, it is likely the pattern is repeated around the country.

‘A broken nose is usually a relatively minor injury and is a relatively straightforward injury to manage,’ he said.

‘However, the question remains as to whether this trend belies a larger underlying problem – one of an increase in alcohol abuse and alcohol-induced violence, especially amongst young females.’
