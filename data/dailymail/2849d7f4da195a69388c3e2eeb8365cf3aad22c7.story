Dangerous man-eater on the loose in Downing Street! On closer inspection it turned out to be ITV presenter Susanna Reid interviewing (or rather devouring) the Prime Minister for breakfast.

Flap flap. The Reid eyelashes beat like the wings of a butterfly trapped at a window pane. She pouted until her lips must have ached worse than Louis Armstrong’s after a night on the toots. Then she bit her pen – grrrrr! Shades of Liz Hurley in one of her leotarded jungle-vamp roles.

My goodness political interviewing has come a distance since Sir Robin Day and his bowtie. Yesterday morning’s broadcast was, unintentionally, comedy of a high order. It confirms Miss Reid as heir to the late Kenny Everett.

Man about the house: Mr Cameron rustles up a quick lunch of sardines and mayonnaise on toast in the modern kitchen of his Downing Street flat. The American-style steel fridge is covered with family photos and magnetic letters while the shelves house a mug collection and gleaming saucepans

He had a character called Cupid Stunt, a glammed-up TV dolly who would lift her whole derriere off the chair when she crossed her thighs. 

Cupid used to scream that it was all being done ‘in the best PAHSSIBLE taste’. Oh, Susanna, we’ll make a Windmill girl out of you yet. 

In that Scarlett and Rhett publicity still of you and the PM, you owned him, baby. And later your puppy eyes would not have disgraced an Andrex advert.

Mr Cameron, we will deduce, is on a personal publicity push. So are the other party leaders. Only the quickest-fingered channel-surfers can these days avoid some fresh outrage against taste by senior politicians.

Tidying up: The PM at his fridge with some wine on show. There's another bottle on the bench. The larder stores olive oils, condiments and - surprisingly - what seems to be salad

A PM's work is never done: Tackling his paperwork among the children's toothbrushes, a tube of toothpaste and a packet of Weetabix

The Milibands, Mrs and clunky Mr, popped up on the BBC bulletins the other night with their kiddywinks in a saccharine parkland scene.

Nigel Farage was giving it full bluster on yesterday’s Daily Politics and had posed for another of his man-with-beer portraits in that pub-bore coat.

Scots Nationalist Nicola Sturgeon was on breakfast telly on Monday, giving the nation a fright with its Frosties.

Meanwhile, Cleggy and the castanet clacker (Senora Miriam) posed for cheesy shots at their spring conference the other day. Mr Cameron, in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry Susanna, yesterday had a soft double-page in London’s Evening Standard and an astonishing effort in The Sun.

He had given personal access to that red-top for an entire day, starting with Jamie Oliver-style footage of him in his kitchen at dawn. What is it with politicians and their kitchens at present?

Appearances: Mr Cameron, in addition to being grrrrrrilled by sultry Susanna Reid, yesterday had a soft double-page in London’s Evening Standard

Politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers

Mr Cameron’s in Downing Street, by the way, has a fridge as large as Imelda Marcos’s shoe closet. He also let The Sun attach a camera to his body so we could see what it looked like to walk into No 10 as PM.

For Heaven’s sake, you lot, you’re contesting a general election, not some Butlin’s Bognor Regis beauty pageant. 

Thanks to The Sun’s intimate web-video we saw a shirtsleeved Prime Minister licking his Hellman’s mayonnaise spoon and concocting a lunch of sardines on toast for the paper’s political editor, who, when asked, declined to say they were delicious.

When the Hellman’s went back in the enormous fridge we copped sight of a fair few bottles of vino. Hic!

We heard our head of government go through his diary to convey what terribly busy days he has (is this news?) And we saw him giving Michael Gove a telling-off for being late to a pre-Cabinet meeting.

One actually quite interesting disclosure was that the Prime Minister calls Cabinet to order by ting-a-linging a little bell, the sort of thing found on the reception desks of small seaside hotels.

Puppy eyes: A flirtatious Susanna Reid interviews David Cameron in Number 10 for Daybreak yesterday

Yes Prime Minister! Susanna pulls a mischievous smile (left) and chews her pen (right) during the interview

He yacked away happily with Miss Reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see Shaun the Sheep The Movie with his little daughter Florence

Endless, soft-focus shots caught the PM bidding hello to office underlings and doorkeepers, quite the breezy brigadier telling the little chaps what a splendid job they were doing.

The camera lingered lovingly on the Camerons’ cat and on photographs on the walls of No 10. This would have been for something like Through the Keyhole but it did not exactly elucidate the Conservative Party’s policies.

How does such a soft-soap sell connect with the blue-collar vote the Tories must retrieve if we are to be spared a Miliband-Sturgeon government?

The film ended with the PM retiring at bedtime. We did not – phew – see him leaping into his pyjamas. 

Boris Johnson will have to wait until 2016 for a Cabinet post if the Tories win the general election, David Cameron signalled yesterday.

The London mayor, who is the Prime Minister’s chief leadership rival, is bidding to return to the Commons and has been tipped for various posts, including party chairman or head of a new infrastructure department.

But Mr Cameron suggested that any appointment would have to wait until Mr Johnson steps down as mayor next year. ‘Boris can do anything, he defies all laws of political logic and gravity,’ he said. ‘But I think he needs to focus on being mayor, strongly. Being MP and the mayor is quite a lot.’

The PM also spoke of how he and George Osborne differed, describing himself as a more traditional Tory and the Chancellor as a ‘metropolitan, market Conservative’. He added: ‘We have both had our ups and downs. Whenever I am down he will offer the hand up and when he is down I will offer the hand.’

Asked who he would back to succeed him, Mr Cameron declined to name an individual – but identified five potential candidates: Mr Johnson and Mr Osborne as well as Theresa May, Michael Gove and Philip Hammond.

He stopped the camera at the door to his family quarters, saying it could go no further. But it may have been a damn close call.

Perhaps such things as economic-industrial strategies and education proposals and political philosophies are no longer considered important by the image-benders and political spin doctors. Perhaps this really is the way to win votes in 2015. But I have my doubts.

Politics has surely not been so serious for decades yet our party leaders are behaving like teenagers. 

The only one to have kept below the radar is the Greens’ woman, Aussie Natalie, but that is probably only because her nerve is shot after her recent mid-interview ‘dry’ on radio.

Back on ITV yesterday morning, Miss Reid was unstoppable. Shameless. Incorrigible! She kept touching her blushing cheeks, drew her mouth into sucky pools of winsome doubt, stroked one of her ears, tilted her black-maned head in a come-hither gesture.

Even the thickest Royal Navy flag office would have been able to translate those signals.

There were times, it must be admitted, when Mr Cameron gave her what we might call an old-fashioned glance, plainly wondering what on earth she had put in her tea. The thought ‘who IS this madwoman?’ flittered across his gaze.

But hey, there is a General Election in the offing. Prime Ministerial dignity was hauled overboard. Soon he was yacking away happily with Miss Reid about his childcare arrangements and how had just been to see Shaun the Sheep The Movie with his little daughter Florence.

‘We try to be a reasonable dad,’ he said. We? As in ‘we are a grandmother’ (copyright M. Thatcher 1989)?

Susanna cooed. Her laughter tinkled like the Trevi fountain. One of her eyeballs swelled. Samantha Cameron, sweetheart, LOOK OUT!
