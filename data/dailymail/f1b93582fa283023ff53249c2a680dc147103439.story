A newborn baby boy was found dead on a moving conveyor belt at a waste recycling plant after he was thrown out with the rubbish, an inquest heard today.

The body was discovered by a horrified worker operating a picking line at Associated Waste Management in Shipley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire.

At the time, the worker was separating mixed household and business waste including glass and paper.

The body was discovered by a horrified worker operating a picking line at Associated Waste Management (pictured), Shipley, near Bradford, West Yorkshire.

It is thought the baby was born four weeks premature and was alive when his mother gave birth - but he died shortly afterwards.

Doctors believe he had been dead for a few days before he was discovered.

Police who investigated the tragedy  sent leaflets to more than 35,000 local households that had rubbish collected that day in a bid to trace the mother.

They also liaised with hospitals and quizzed 15 women as potential suspects but all were found to have given birth to healthy babies or were never pregnant at all.

Inquiries revealed a second baby had been found at the same plant 18 months earlier. She was not identified and there was no DNA profile to match her and the boy.

Today the hearing was told officers were unable to identify the boy. His cause of death is also unknown as his body had suffered numerous fractures before being found.

The discovery was made at 10pm on September 18 last year as workers were dealing with collections from Bradford Council, Leeds Council and private refuse companies.

Gary Normington, a recycle plant worker described how he saw what he thought was a body.

He told the Bradford hearing: 'I took a second look and then saw what I thought was a head. I shouted to stop and a colleague pulled the cord to stop the conveyor belt. I said something like "It's a baby." I heard someone say "Is it". I then started to feel sick.

'I went to sit on the stair well. I then saw the site managers. I said "are you sure?" I said "yes." I knew it was obviously human when I saw its head and eyes.' 

He added: 'That image will stay with me for a long time.'

Richard Winterbottom, the site manager, told the inquest: 'We accept waste from 8am to 4pm, Monday to Friday. The rest of the time is spent processing the waste. We have 300 tonnes delivered each day by 50 wagons.'

Mr Winterbottom told the inquest that legally the site must process the waste within 24 hours of it being deposited by the wagons. 

The wagons deposit the waste at the site, at which point it is weighed and dropped in a processing area before going through numerous machines which siphon off larger objects.

He said: 'It goes in a large magnetic machine that lefts metal items and separates them. It goes through a large washing machine.'

The waste then passes through a machine called Trommel which separates the materials by size so that the larger objects can be sorted by hand on a conveyor belt. This is the start of the recycle process. If it is not suitable for the conveyor it goes to land fill.'

Det Supt Jim Harrison of West Yorkshire Police said officers made contact with the local health authorities in West Yorkshire which included Leeds, Wakefield, Bradford, Calderdale and Keighley. 

Various people came forward saying they had seen pregnant women on their street who they had not seen in recent months.

He added: 'As we suspected the child was prematurely born or close to full time, we deemed it was likely that we would potentially, from inquiries, be able to find females that the local authority had concern for or were in the midwifery department - females pregnant but disengaged or had given birth and had not further contact with.'

'Once we had established where all the refuse was collected, from analysts we were able to establish every single property that had rubbish collected that day. 

'Fifteen females come into the enquiry and we were able to eliminate every single one as having a non -pregnancy or having given birth to a healthy child.'

DS Harrison told the inquest that DNA tests were carried out to find links to the baby's parents - however only a partial profile was found. 

The DNA results were run through local West and North Yorkshire databases and the investigation will remain open in the hope that someone will come forward.

Coroner Oliver Longstaff recorded an open verdict saying: 'The basis of the evidence shows that the death appeared to have occurred at least a few days before the baby was found. Where the baby died we do not know. One of the things I have to determine if I can is whether the baby was a still birth or live.

'On the balance of probability it is my cautious view that it is slightly more likely that this baby was born alive than dead. 

'The cause of death remains undetermined because of the state the body was in when it was found.'
