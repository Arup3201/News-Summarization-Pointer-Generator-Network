It is a problem every smartphone and tablet owner has had - once the sun comes out, seeing your gadget's display becomes virtually impossible.

Now researchers may have an answer - in the shape of a tiny set of teeth.

The 'nanoteeth' etched into the glass are able to make it anti glare and anti reflective.

The new glass surface that reduces both glare and reflection, which continue to plague even the best mobile displays today.

On a very fine scale, they roughened a glass surface so it could scatter light and ward off glare but without hurting the glass’s transparency.

Then the researchers etched nano-size teeth into the surface to make it anti-reflective.

In addition to achieving both of these visual traits, the researchers showed the textured surface repelled water, mimicking a lotus leaf.

Spanish researchers at the The Institute of Photonic Sciences working with Prantik Mazumder’s team at Corning Incorporated set out to find a new method.

Users still typically have to buy a filter or film - some of questionable effectiveness - to lay on top of their glass screens so they can use the devices in bright light, or rely on a mono screen such as those in Amazon's Kindle.

The team said teeth were the key.

'Although the anti-glare roughening protects the nano-size glass teeth, further research is needed to ensure that the surface can withstand heavy touchscreen use', they say.

They add that the method is inexpensive and can easily be scaled up for industry use.
