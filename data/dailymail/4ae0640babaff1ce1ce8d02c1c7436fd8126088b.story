Everton boss Roberto Martinez is not looking to sign a replacement for Samuel Eto'o during the January transfer window.

The veteran striker's move to Sampdoria was confirmed on Tuesday and Martinez sees Arouna Kone, who is fit again after a long-term knee injury, as the player to step into the breach.

Everton are enduring a difficult season and have failed to win any of their last eight games, but Martinez is in no hurry to bring in reinforcements.

He told the club's official website: 'January is not the place to find solutions (in the transfer market). Our moment of form, we want to change, but the solutions are in the squad.

'With Arouna Kone being fully fit, I see him as a replacement for Samuel's position and it is more about trying to get the players back from injury.

'Steven Pienaar and Leon Osman have been two players missing throughout the season, which has been disappointing because they are important in the way we want to play.

'Leon played in every single game last season and we miss what he brings. So I am looking around that.

'We are always working and if we can do something to help the players we have got at the club then we will do something. But what's clear is that January is not very straightforward.

'You never get value for money, first and foremost, and you will not get players you have been following for a long time. And if you want to rely on January to find solutions for your season, then it is a big gamble.'
