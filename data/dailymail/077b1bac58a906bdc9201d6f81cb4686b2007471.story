Harsh: Food writer Jay Rayner has criticised farmers' markets

His acerbic put downs are usually restricted to hapless chefs and pretentious restaurants.

But food critic Jay Rayner has now served up a withering assessment of farmers’ markets – to the fury of those who run them.

The MasterChef star, who also works as a critic for BBC One programme The One Show, said that the overpriced fare sold at local markets is nothing more than a ‘status symbol’ for wealthy shoppers.

Instead, the 47-year-old has extolled the virtues of sprawling supermarket chains who offer cheap ingredients, while dismissing the idea of buying a £15 chicken as similar to splashing out on a Chanel handbag.

While Mr Rayner said that he enjoyed the experience of visiting local markets, the increasing difficulty in feeding a growing worldwide population meant that a minority of shoppers who insisted on buying expensive, locally-grown food resulted in ‘a veneer of self-righteousness’.

In an interview in the local Cotswold Life magazine, Rayner said: ‘As I say repeatedly, I like a good farmers’ market. But if you think they’re a genuine answer to food retail in the UK, you’re sadly mistaken.

‘Buying a £15 chicken is no more a challenge to the supermarkets than buying a Chanel handbag is a challenge to Primark. It’s a status symbol. It’s a nice one and one I’m able to enjoy; and one I suspect a lot of your readers in the Cotswolds are able to enjoy because they’ve got a penny or two.

‘I’m not a head-banging old Trot. There is nothing wrong with spending your expendable income in whatever way you wish. But what you mustn’t do is to allow there to be a veneer of self-righteousness across the top of it, which makes that indulgence of an aesthetic into some political statement. Because that it ain’t.’

It was last year that Mr Rayner released a book called A Greedy Man in a Hungry World, which championed supermarkets, super-dairies and industrialised production methods.

He argued that a growing global population, especially in China and Asia, are putting growing pressure of food resources around the world.

He warned in the interview with Cotswold Life that the increasing difficulties in feeding so many people will ‘make the sight of young chefs on telly talking about their passion for cooking and their commitment to local and seasonal ingredients sound like the screeching of fiddles while Rome burns.’

Not accessible: Mr Rayner said farmers' markets were the designer label of food shopping while supermarkets the high street chains

Talking about the benefits of foreign imports and giving the example of being able to buy cheap produce such as corn from the US, he added in the interview: ‘You don’t own a local mobile phone because they make them better and cheaper in China.’

However, Mr Rayner’s comments have angered the National Market Traders Association, who claim that traditional UK markets employ almost 100,000 people across the country.

Joe Harrison, CEO of the NMTA hit out at Mr Rayner, saying: ‘This kind of thing really gets my goat and I’d like to put Mr Rayner right.

‘He is clearly taking this to the extreme by criticising what he sees as “fashionable” farmers markets. There are 1,400 traditional markets operating across the UK, all of which could beat supermarkets hands down in terms quality of meat, fish and vegetables.

‘I can name markets which will offer 30 different types of potato, while most supermarkets will offer just three. Farmer’s markets have a huge appeal with the British public, and these traditional markets have seen a huge increase in popularity following the horsemeat scandal, because clearly people trust the produce.

‘Turnover from farmer’s markets in the UK reaches almost £4bn each year, and we can’t ignore that they are a major employers. There are almost 100,000 people working on markets across the UK. To suggest supermarkets are a better alternative to traditional farmer’s markets is wrong.’
