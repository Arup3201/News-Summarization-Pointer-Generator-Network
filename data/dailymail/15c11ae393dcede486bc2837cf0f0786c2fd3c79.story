Since 1784, the bells of St Mary’s in the sleepy village of Bramshott, Hampshire, have pealed out their mellifluous call to worship every Sunday.

But this morning the bells will be silent after bellringers decided to go on strike – because the vicar asked them to begin pealing too early in the morning.

Despite their enthusiasm for their art, they believe villagers do not want their Sunday morning lie-ins disturbed at the ungodly hour of 8.45am.

Silent protest: Bellringers, lead by captain Toby Arkless, have gone on strike because they believe villagers do not want their Sunday morning lie-ins disturbed at the ungodly hour of 8.45am

Bramshott vicar Valentine Inglis-Jones caused the stand-off when he decided to move his Sunday morning service from 11.15am to 9.15am in an attempt to tempt more people to attend church.

But the captain of the campanologists, Toby Arkless, said: ‘We don’t believe it is right to peal the bells before 9am as people have been working all week and like to enjoy a lie-in.

‘What is particularly galling is that the vicar made the decision without consulting the bellringers.

‘We have asked the vicar to move the service just 15 minutes later so we can do our ringing without waking everyone up at the crack of dawn, but he refuses to do so.’

A leaflet has been posted through villagers’ doors, telling them of the Sunday stand-off.

It says: ‘The bells of St Mary’s have been calling Christians to worship on Sundays since the 1700s.

‘Following decision by the vicar to change the times of the Sunday services, it now seems unlikely that the bells will be rung again on a Sunday morning. The responsibility for this action lies directly with the vicar. The question to be asked is .  .  . What would Jesus have done?’

Mr Inglis-Jones made the decision to 
move the times of the Sunday service with permission from the Parochial 
Church Council. They believe moving worship to an earlier time slot will
attract more parents with younger children to church as an earlier 
service interferes less with the day. It also allows the vicar to 
perform a second service in nearby Liphook.

The village’s online message board includes comments from residents unhappy at the decision.

Some
have complained that since Mr Inglis-Jones took up the post 18 months 
ago, he has isolated more traditional members of the congregation.

One wrote: ‘Is this how it should be for devoted Christians who have remained loyal to St Mary’s for 30 to 40 years .  .  . and indeed heavily contributed their time, efforts and finances?

‘Is this vicar being led by the voice of God or by the voice of his ego?’

Another wrote: ‘It seems to me the whole village is going to suffer the loss of the bells, and it is a shame that one man’s arrogance and stubbornness can bring this about.’

A third comments: ‘Very, very sad and 
quite shocked to learn the church bells of Bramshott will not ring on a 
Sunday morning. I hear it’s all to do with a more “convenient” time for 
the Sunday service. Seems to have been perfectly satisfactory until 
now.’

The bells have rung almost every Sunday since 1784 and were restored in 1989 with money from the late Frankenstein actor Boris Karloff, who used to enjoy listening to them from his nearby garden.

Mr Inglis-Jones said: ‘We didn’t quite know how a pre-9.15am ring would work but assumed it was manageable as long as the residents of Bramshott didn’t mind.

‘Apparently ringing after church just isn’t done – although we would love it – and unfortunately our bellringers don’t want to consider a pre-9am ring.

‘The bellringers have asked us to move our 9.15am service to 9.30. The problem is we can’t move it without seriously inconveniencing many of our families.’
