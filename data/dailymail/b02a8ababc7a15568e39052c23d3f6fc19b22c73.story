The magical process of a large and colourful butterfly emerging from its pupa has been captured by a Spanish photographer.

Artist Jimmy Hoffman, 52, who lives in Calonge in the north east corner of Spain, took a series of photographs of the step-by-step process at his home.

After waiting patiently for five hours, the photographer captured the moment the two-tailed pasha butterfly emerged from its cocoon - from when its wings could just be seen peeping out of the chrysalis to when it finally became visible in all its glory.

Spanish artist and photographer Jimmy Hoffman has captured the step-by-step process of a beautiful two-tailed pasha butterfly emerging from its pupa

The process of breaking free from its clear cocoon to spreading its wings for the first time, took the butterfly, which is commonly found in the Mediterranean, around 30 minutes.

Mr Hoffman said: ‘After around two weeks the pupa was getting a darker colour as the wings and body of the butterfly shone through the transparent pupa-skin.

‘I knew that it was almost time for the butterfly to emerge.

‘You never can predict exactly when the process of emerging will start, so I had to wait the whole morning before it happened.’

The photographer had his camera set up and on standby and waited five hours for the creature to begin to emerge.

Mr Hoffman waited five hours for the butterfly to emerge and first noticed its head and legs appearing, which were followed by its soft and shriveled wings before its body emerged. he said it did not look very beautiful at first

‘First the head and legs appeared and then the soft and still tiny wings and eventually the whole body emerged,’ he said.

‘In the beginning the butterfly wasn't looking very beautiful with his shrivelled wings.’

Mr Hoffman said that for the first 10 minutes the insect tried to look for a good place to hold on to and decided to hang below the empty pupa skin.

‘Then it started to pump blood into the wing veins. You can see the wings grow and grow bigger and the beautiful patterns become visible,’ he said.

‘The whole process took a few hours and after that the butterfly had to wait until the wings were completely dry before it could fly away."

Mr Hoffman said he first came across the 'insect' when it was a caterpillar egg on Arbutus unedo, which is commonly known as a strawberry tree because of its red edible fruits.

He spotted the tiny yellow-coloured eggs on the top side of the leaves on the evergreen shrub. The artist took the egg home and put it in a plastic container so he could track its transformation.

The photographer said he first came across the butterfly when it was a caterpillar egg on a strawberry tree and then looked after the egg and caterpillar so he could watch it emerge into the magnificent butterfly

‘This species of caterpillar only feeds from this food plant. I had to change the leaves every two days, because the caterpillars prefer fresh leaves’, he said.

After a few weeks and after four or five moults, the caterpillar was fully grown, Mr Hoffman said.

‘Approximately five centimetres long, it was ready to moult for the last time and change into a beautiful jade-green pupa.

’Of course after the photography session I set the butterfly free so it could look for a partner and take care of offspring,’ he said.

After breaking free, the insect spent around 10 minutes looking for a good place to hold on to and decided to hang below the empty pupa skin. It started to pump blood into its wing veins, which meant its wings grew in size and the patterns on them became visible. It took a few hours for the butterfly's new wings to completely dry so it could fly away
