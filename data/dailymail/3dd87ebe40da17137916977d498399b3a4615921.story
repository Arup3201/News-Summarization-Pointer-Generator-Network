Important discussions: Prime Minister David Cameron has recalled Parliament for today

David Cameron was forced to delay plans for immediate military strikes on Syria last night after being warned he faced losing a Commons vote.

The Prime Minister battled desperately to get a consensus for a missile attack, but was forced by Ed Miliband and Tory rebels to allow UN inspectors time to report on last week’s chemical weapons atrocity.

MPs will vote tonight on a hastily prepared motion which still supports the principle of military action.

However, it will not now be carried out until ‘every effort’ has been made to secure a UN agreement, and even then, direct British involvement would require a second Commons vote.

The decision to wait for a second vote is a humiliating setback for Mr Cameron who had privately promised Barack Obama that Britain would stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States.

British officials had to phone their counterparts in the US last night to explain that President Obama would have to go it alone or wait to see if Mr Cameron can persuade MPs to back him in the coming days. Mr Cameron had little choice, because losing a Commons vote could have triggered his own downfall.

On another day of dramatic developments:

Demonstration: Activists block Whitehall near the junction with Downing Street during an event organised by Stop the War Coalition to protest against potential UK involvement in the Syrian conflict

Listening: Protesters hear from Diane Abbot MP at a Stop the War Coalition demonstration at Downing Street

Downing Street reacted angrily to the dramatic U-turn by Mr Miliband, who had initially indicated support for intervention.

A
 senior source said: ‘Labour has been playing politics when they should 
have been thinking about the national interest.

'Their position has 
changed consistently over the last 24 hours, finally ending in demands 
they had not even hinted at before.’

 sources last night said Mr Cameron was still determined to get approval
 for a retaliatory strike on Syria within days.

A second Commons vote is likely to be held early next week, and could even come as soon as tomorrow or Saturday.

Mr
 Cameron will now rush out an Iraq-style intelligence dossier on Syria 
this morning in a desperate bid to persuade his own MPs – and Labour – 
that Assad’s use of chemical weapons must be met with a show of force 
from the West.

Last night it
 was unclear whether the United States will press ahead with plans for a
 missile bombardment this weekend – or pause its assault to see if Mr 
Cameron can deliver British support.

Mr
 Miliband’s decision to withdraw support for immediate attacks on Syria 
dealt a major blow to the Prime Minister as he prepared to deliver the 
speech of his life.

If MPs have the slightest suspicion that attacking Syria will cause more suffering than it can possibly prevent they have a fundamental moral duty to vote No. Read more

Just 
before 6pm the Labour leader, who has dithered for days over the issue, 
said he would order his divided party to vote against immediate action, 
to allow the United Nations more time to consider evidence about the 
atrocity.

Within an hour the
 Government had issued its own Parliamentary motion saying it would not 
act until the UN Security Council had had time to consider the report of
 the weapons inspectors.

A Government source said Mr Miliband had 
‘barely mentioned the UN’ when he held talks with Mr Cameron and Nick 
Clegg in Downing Street on Tuesday.

Would bombing Syria be lawful?

Britain and the US insist it would be, but the truth is far from clear. It’s hard to see how Syria’s reported chemical attacks against its own citizens present a direct threat to either country.

What specific laws or UN conventions might be used as justification?

The UN Charter allows for military action on only two grounds – in self-defence, or if action is approved by the UN Security Council. Neither applies here.

Russia has made clear its intention to veto any proposed Security Council resolution authorising action – as has China.

Can a military strike be legal without a UN resolution?

Unclear. In 1999, the Nato bombing campaign against Serbia was launched without one, with Tony Blair and President Clinton seeking to justify it on humanitarian grounds to protect Kosovan civilians.

The intervention was widely welcomed, but its legality was questionable. A similar humanitarian argument is being used to defend intervention in Syria.

If President Assad is proved to have launched poison gas attacks on his own people, he will be in breach of the Geneva Gas Protocol, an international agreement dating back to 1925 – to which Syria is a signatory – banning the use of chemical weapons.

But breaching the protocol doesn’t provide a clear justification for military action and it normally applies to international conflicts, rather than civil wars.

Does the UN have a ‘Responsibility to Protect’ the Syrians?

In 2005, following the hideous atrocities committed in Rwanda and Bosnia in the 1990s, the UN brought forward an initiative called the ‘Responsibility to Protect’.

It was designed to protect the innocent from genocide, war crimes and ethnic cleansing and places a duty on individual states to prevent such horrors within their borders, and an obligation to intervene if they see it elsewhere.

But former UN assistant Secretary-General, Francesc Vendrell, says the doctrine does not necessarily justify the use of force.

All diplomatic efforts must have been tried first, and even then military intervention requires the backing of the Security Council – taking David Cameron and President Obama back to square one.

Does the PM need Parliamentary backing for a bombing campaign?

Technically, no. He retains the power, under Royal Prerogative, to use military force without Parliamentary approval.

However, all recent major military interventions – including the wars in Iraq and Libya  – have been preceded by a Commons vote. The Government has made clear it will ‘respect the outcome’ of tonight’s.

He
 then phoned the Prime Minister on Tuesday night to say he needed a ‘UN 
moment’ before he could act – prompting Britain to table a UN Security 
Council resolution yesterday despite the certain knowledge it would be 
blocked by Russia.

He then 
visited Downing Street again yesterday to demand that the inspectors be 
allowed to report, even though they have not been asked to rule on 
whether Assad was responsible for last week’s atrocity.

With
 dozens of Tories also warning they were yet to be convinced by the case
 for an attack, Mr Cameron was facing the prospect of a potential 
Commons defeat and had no choice but to give way.

A
 Downing Street spokesman said the new Commons motion ‘reflects the 
Prime Minister’s respect for the UN process – something he made clear to
 President Obama several days ago’.

The 370-word motion agrees that military action may be necessary and would be legally sound. But it’s awash with conditions, caveats and turgid language.

IT SAYS:

‘This House:

'Deplores the use of chemical weapons in Syria on 21 August 2013 by the Assad regime, which caused hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries of Syrian civilians;

'Recalls the importance of upholding the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons under international law;

'Agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action that is legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria’s chemical weapons;

'Notes the failure of the United Nations Security Council over the last two years to take united action in response to the Syrian crisis;

'Notes that the use of chemical weapons is a war crime under customary law and a crime against humanity – and that the principle of humanitarian intervention provides a sound legal basis for taking action;

'Notes the wide international support for such a response, including the statement from the Arab League on 27 August which calls on the international community, represented in the United Nations Security Council, to "overcome internal disagreements and take action against those who committed this crime, for which the Syrian regime is responsible";

'Believes, in spite of the difficulties at the United Nations, that a United Nations process must be followed as far as possible to ensure the maximum legitimacy for any such action;

'Therefore welcomes the work of  the United Nations investigating  team currently in Damascus.

'Whilst noting that the team’s mandate is to confirm whether chemical  weapons were used and not to apportion blame, agrees that the  United Nations Secretary General  should ensure a briefing to the United Nations Security Council immediately upon the completion of the team’s initial mission;

'Believes that the United Nations Security Council must have the opportunity immediately to consider that briefing and that every effort should be made to secure a Security Council Resolution backing military action before any such action is taken. Before any direct British involvement in such action a further vote of the House of Commons will take place.

'Notes that this motion relates solely to efforts to alleviate humanitarian suffering by deterring use of chemical weapons and does not sanction any action in Syria with wider objectives.’
