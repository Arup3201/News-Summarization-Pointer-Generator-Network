Trudging through IKEA's vast showrooms looking for the right bunkbeds for the kids' bedroom can be a wearying chore.

So it can be a blessed relief to flop down on one of the beds or sofas on display for a few minutes rest - even if its not strictly 'try before you buy'.

But on the other side of the world from the flatpack firm's native Sweden, these Chinese customers really do seem to have shopped until they've dropped.

Blessed relief: A Chinese shopper sleeps on a bed in the showroom of the IKEA store on Beijing, China

Room for two: A woman curls up with her baby on a rather ruffled bed in the cool, air-conditioned IKEA store

No pictures! A woman hides her face with a fan after kicking off her shoes and putting her feet up on a sofa

Desperate for some rest: This shopper doesn't care that the bed he's sleeping on has not yet been made

Sweaty Betty: Even with air conditioning cooling the pace, sleeping on leather is risky

Run out of beds? A woman takes her nap on a high-backed swivel chair in one of the shop's mocked-up rooms

Tiring: Another pair of shattered shoppers flop over the flatpack furniture

Lounging: This corner sofa is so sumptuous and expansive that there's room for two total strangers to sleep

IKEA's massive Beijing store - one of the world's biggest - is a favourite siesta spot for stressed city slickers looking for a place to rest from the mid-summer heat.

Most don't want to buy anything, but have instead visited for the express purpose of taking a nap, catching up with friends, or just to bask in the cool air-conditioned climate.

Visiting IKEA without the need for a Billy bookcase or endless storage solutions, but simply to enjoy the comfort of a Lervik frame or the bounce of a Malm may seem ludicrous, but in China it's a growing trend.

Despite the country's burgeoning economic might, many Chinese still live in cramped conditions in old-fashioned homes, as a state-mandated building boom churns out millions of properties normal people can't afford.

IKEA hasn't taken any measures against people making themselves at home, because it sees it as a future investment.

Cool: Most of the visitors have come to take advantage of the shop's air conditioning - an expensive luxury

Accommodating: Staff don't try to remove them, their presence is seen as an investment in the brand's future

Cushion cuddlers: Many Chinese cannot yet afford the luxuries of IKEA furniture, but they hope to soon

Siesta sofa: There is plenty of room in the huge Beijing store - one of the world's largest - for all the sleepers

Stretching out: Many Chinese still live in cramped conditions in old-fashioned homes

Couch potatoes: IKEA is the world's largest furniture company, with profits last year of £2.7billion

Much of the increase in those profits has been driven by expansion into new markets like Russia and China

So even if these customers can't afford a Billy bookcase now, IKEA is betting they will be able to soon...

IKEA was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943. It is now the world’s largest furniture retailer, recording an annual net profit of £2.7billion in 2013, from sales of £22.1billion in 44 countries.

It opened up its first shop in China in 1999 and the country is now home to eight of the top-10 largest IKEAs in the world.

There are more IKEA catalogues than bibles printed each year, and it is said that one in ten Europeans is now conceived in an IKEA bed.
