The mother of a Blackpool teenager who died after falling into the sea, has paid a tribute to her 'perfect boy'.

David Sagar, 17, fell backwards from the sea wall into the water near Gynn Square, in the North Shore area of the resort, on Friday afternoon.

His friends alerted emergency services who launched two lifeboats and the teen was pulled out of the sea.

But despite frantic attempts to resuscitate him, David was pronounced dead on the shore.

Police said they were treating the death as a tragic accident.

But it is still unclear what led to David's death - he may have had difficulty keeping his head above water in the cold sea after the shock of falling, -or if he hit the wall as he fell, this may have impacted his ability to stay afloat.

Speaking from her home in Blackpool, David’s mother, Anne-Marie Sagar, 34, said her son was 'loved by everyone'.

She said: 'David was the sweetest boy and everybody only had the best things to say about him.

'He was with two close friends who he had known for a long time when it happened.

'I can’t believe I’m not going to see him again. I keep looking up the street thinking he is going to walk down it.

Police say they are treating David's death as a tragic accident

'I just want him back and I wish I could turn the clocks back and have him here.'

Flowers and messages have been laid at the spot where David died at 4.25pm on Friday.

His mother has written a touching 
tribute in chalk which reads: 'David, my perfect boy. I love you more 
than words can describe.'

Ms Sagar, a trainee teacher, added: 'David made everyone laugh and smile and he was sunshine to everybody.

'He was loved by everyone because he was funny, cool, sweet and never did anything bad.

'He was a handsome boy. He never smoked or drank alcohol and he only ever went out with his friends and played video games.

'He used to tell me he loved me all the time.'

David, who passed his GCSEs last 
summer, was looking for work before he started a college course in 
September.

It had been his dream to work with children.

His sister Alicia, 15, added: 'He was my idol and my best friend.'

David’s grandmother Christine Sagar, 
57, added: 'He was a wonderful lad and
it’s wrong he should be taken from us.

'There’s nothing bad anyone can say about him because he was awesome.'

Danger: The seas off Gynn Square are notorious and more than a dozen people have died there in the last 30 years

David’s best friend from school Joe 
Wrigler, 16, from Blackpool, said: 'He never did anything 
wrong - this is not fair.

'He always used to try and make something funny that wasn’t and make the best out of it.'

Police said they were treating David’s death as a tragic accident.

The seas off Gynn Square are notorious and more than a dozen people have died there in the last 30 years.

Two school friends from Blackpool died there in 2005 when they were swept to their deaths. 

And police officers Colin Morrison, 
Gordon Connolly and Angela Bradley died when they tried to save a 
holidaymaker in the sea in January 1983.
