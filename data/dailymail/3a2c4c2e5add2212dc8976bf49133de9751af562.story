Malcolm Butler is finally getting his hands on that Super Bowl MVP prize.

The New England Patriots cornerback, who just last May was an undrafted rookie, became a part of history on Sunday after he made one of the biggest plays in Bowl history, turning a possible Patriots loss into a definite Patriots victory when he intercepted Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson on the one-yard-line with just 20 seconds left in the game.

The play was so big in fact, and so crucial to the Patriots victory, that many felt Butler would be taking home MVP honors for the evening.

In the end tough, it went to the man who two interceptions that night, and two previous MVP trophies - Tom Brady.

And while Brady was sure to mention Butler and his game-changing play when accepting his award, he reportedly decided to make things a bit more official on Tuesday by  getting his off-season started with a pretty impressive and unconventional play of his own and handing off the truck that is awarded to the winner each year, in this case a nice new Chevrolet Colorado, which retails for about $20,000, to Butler.

The Detroit News reports Brady will keep the actual trophy.

And while many outside the organization are surprised by Butler's rise from virtually unknown to post-season legend, his teammates have been seeing this kind of work and smart play in practice all season.

'He’s been doing it to me in practice all season so it was nice to see him pick someone else off,' joked Brady.

This after Brady said as he received his MVP award; 'Malcolm made a huge play to save our season. It was the perfect play at the perfect time. None of us will ever forget that play.'

Vince Wilfork, the most respected member of the team's defense, echoed Brady's statement, saying; 'That is just one of those things that is so fitting for him just because of how he worked himself into playing time.' 

Butler's play was not just a win for the Patriots either, with his uplifting story and remarkable play providing the NFL with one of the few positive stories to come out of the league during this scandal-plagued season and ending things on a very high not.

Brady added a few more records to his legacy on Sunday well as he now has the most Super Bowl appearances (six), the most Super Bowl victories alongside Terry Bradshaw and Joe Montana (four), and the most MVP trophies, again shared with Montana (three).
