Roberto Martinez has gushed about his January signing Aaron Lennon after the winger scored the winning goal in Everton's crucial relegation clash with Queens Park Rangers.

The on-loan Tottenham star is quickly becoming a key player for the Toffees as they continue to fight for survival and has slotted in nicely on the right side of midfield.

Martinez is delighted with the impact Lennon has made especially against QPR.

'Since day one he has come in and showed an incredible appetite,' Martinez told talkSPORT.

'I thought against Newcastle he played very well and from that point I didn't want him to lose that feeling so I asked him to travel to Kiev. He couldn't play but he was around the group and I thought we benefited from that.

'He looked like a player that has been at Everton for years [against QPR]. He took responsibility, he knew he had fresh legs, and the way he performed was magnificent.

'It wasn't just what he did in front of goal, but the way he worked in defence was a real help. It was a really strong performance.' 

The winger was frozen out at White Hart Lane but seems to have had a new lease of life in Merseyside and with safety from relegation not quite secured, Martinez will be hoping Lennon can continue to play a vital role in prolonging their Premier League status.
