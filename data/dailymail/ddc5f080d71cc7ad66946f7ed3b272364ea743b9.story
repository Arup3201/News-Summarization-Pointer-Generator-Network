Theresa May yesterday vowed that hate preacher Abu Qatada will not be allowed back into Britain after he was cleared of terror offences in Jordan.

The Home Secretary insisted the UK will remain closed to the Al Qaeda-linked extremist, who was deported after a decade-long battle costing up to £1million.

Her pledge came minutes after judges in Jordan acquitted the cleric of involvement in plotting atrocities in his home country on the grounds of ‘insufficient evidence’.

A Jordan court has acquitted radical preacher Abu Qatada, seen here speaking to media after his release from prison, of plotting attacks on Americans and Israelis

Mrs May said: ‘The UK courts here were very clear that Abu Qatada poses a threat to our national security. That’s why we were pleased as a government to remove him from the UK.

‘He is subject to a deportation order, he is also subject to a UN travel ban. That means he will not be returning to the UK.’

However, Qatada is now likely to attract attention for his views on Islamic State, which he has condemned as ‘evil’. There is also speculation that he may join calls for the release of British hostage Alan Henning.

Counter-extremist think-tank the Quilliam Foundation said Qatada was ‘no friend’ of the Jordanian government but could now be used against Islamic State.

Writings have recently appeared online in the radical cleric’s name – apparently smuggled from his prison cell – which denounced the militants as ‘the dogs of hellfire’.

Earlier this month, he condemned the beheading of two US journalists by IS, saying it contradicted Islamic teachings.

Home Secretary Theresa May insisted there was no way for Abu Qatada to return to Britain because of the long battle she fought to have him removed. Mrs May attended a rally for Muslim women against ISIS in London.

The court ruled there was insufficient evidence against Abu Qatada and his defense lawyer, Husein Mubaidin, says he expects his client to be released within hours

Long stay: Abu Qatada and his family moved to Britain in 1993 and were granted asylum the following year. While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000

Nevertheless, Whitehall officials have warned that Qatada could still provide religious or spiritual justification for acts of terrorism.

Security officials will closely monitor any public pronouncements and will be anxious to see if Jordan imposes the sort of restraints he received in the UK, such as internet or mobile phone curbs.

Experts also predicted that now freed, the fanatic could attempt to radicalise British Muslims from overseas. The cleric’s family cheered as the verdict was delivered in Jordan’s capital Amman yesterday.

Dressed in brown overalls, Qatada kissed his lawyer through the bars of his caged dock and was later freed from custody and reunited with his wife and children, who left behind taxpayer-funded lives in Britain to join him last year.

At the trial, he was accused of providing spiritual support through his writings to men alleged to have planned atrocities aimed at Western and Israeli targets during Jordan’s Millennium Eve celebrations.

Prosecutors said books by the cleric were found in the raids and accused him of supplying funds to the plotters.

A court had previously found Qatada guilty of the terror offences in his absence. He was granted a retrial on the grounds that evidence obtained by torture would not be used.

The 53-year-old preacher was also acquitted in June in another case, a foiled 1998 plot to attack an American school in Amman.

Once linked to Osama Bin Laden, Qatada was first arrested in Britain in 2001 but lodged appeal after appeal against extradition while enjoying £450,000 in benefits.

He finally agreed to go voluntarily after Mrs May secured a string of promises from the Jordanian authorities that he would be fairly treated.

However, former Home Secretary David Blunkett said the length of time it took to deport him made it more difficult to secure a conviction.

He told the BBC: ‘Abu Qatada’s managed to do what he wanted to do, which was to prevaricate for ten years. However, it also proves that he was wrong, because the case he made against extradition was that he wouldn’t receive a fair trial in Jordan and he clearly has.’ 

Abu Qatada was born in the West Bank city of Bethlehem in 1960, which was under the control of Jordan at the time.

At the age of 29 he moved to Peshawar in Pakistan to teach about Sharia law, before moving to Kuwait.

In 1991 - after the Gulf War - he was kicked out the country along with other Palestinians and returned to Jordan. 

Two years later Qatada and his family applied for asylum in the UK, claiming he had been tortured in Jordan. This application was granted in June 1994.

In the late 1990s Qatada came to MI5's attention as his sermons became more extreme and his influence increased.

From his home in North London, he was later described as the 'in-house' adviser to radical groups around the world.

In 1999 and 2000 Qatada was convicted in his absence and given a life sentence in Jordan for the two alleged terror plots for which he has been standing trial.

Qatada was arrested in the UK for the first time following the September 11 attacks, but was not charged with any crime.

He was repeatedly linked with extremist groups over the subsequent decade.

Mr Justice Collins, then chairman of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said he was 'heavily involved, indeed was at the centre' of al-Qaeda's UK activities, calling him 'a truly dangerous individual.'

While living in Britain, Qatada lived on benefits totalling an estimated £500,000.

The campaign to extradite Qatada to face the terror conspiracy Jordan began in 2007, but was continually delayed by claims he would be tortured on his return.

After initially barring the UK deporting Qatada, the European Court of Human Rights finally denied him leave to appeal in 2012 after receiving assurances from Jordan that he would not be tortured.

Qatada finally left the UK to face trial the following July.
