She's mothered orphaned elephants, helped create Kenya's mighty Tsavo National Park and has spent years railing against poaching: Life, for Dame Daphne Sheldrick, has certainly been interesting.

Now the veteran conservationist, who turns 80 tomorrow, has opened up for the first time on the moments that have made her life among the elephants so magical, although not all concern pachyderms.

'A much treasured bond was 
with a Thompson gazelle who we named Geri,' reveals Dame Daphne, who still lives near the Kenyan capital Nairobi, in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'She was 
rescued from the 
Kitengela plains, just outside of Nairobi, when her mother was killed 
for bush meat.' Geri, who spent her early months being hand-raised in 
Daphne's daughter Angela's home, eventually became a loving pet.

But
 tragedy almost struck when the little gazelle was grabbed by a lioness 
while sitting on a daybed on Angela's veranda. 'Angela who immediately 
took off down the
 hill after the lioness, who had Geri in her mouth,' remembers Daphne.

'She was screaming like a banshee, which proved too much for the pride so they abandoned their 
kill but not before Geri was quite literally shredded.  

'It
 never occurred to me that Geri would 
ever be able to recover from this encounter but she was rushed to the 
vet and was stitched up, with my 15-year-old grandson Taru, the person 
she loved the most, with her.

'Over the following weeks and months though, with 
tender loving care from everyone, Geri came back to life, and eventually
 made a full recovery. It was her unwavering love and loyalty to the 
family that was so humbling.'

But
 little Geri isn't the only animal Daphne and Angela have taken into 
their homes and hearts over the years. From gazelles to elephants and 
even rhinos, all have been welcomed into Daphne's life, with many later 
finding permanent homes in the 9,000sqkm Tsavo National Park, which was 
founded in the 1960s with the help of Daphne and her husband David.

The existence of the park remains one of Daphne's proudest achievements. 'I had rewarding life with 
David, my late husband,' she remembers.

'Building Tsavo National Park together from 
virgin bush over so many years was extremely special.

'But seeing my children and grandchildren's love for the natural world and their commitment 
to the David Sheldrake Wildlife Trust and the work we do is the most rewarding - knowing that the 
legacy of all we have worked towards will continue long after I am gone.'

Sadly
 for Daphne and her family, their work is becoming more intense than 
ever before, largely as a result of increased poaching driven by the 
demand for rhino horn and ivory from China and the Far East.

'Bite
 your finger nails - it’s the same 
stuff,' fumes Daphne. 'The ridiculous hype around rhino horn is fuelled 
by false propaganda by those who want to make money from the sale of 
rhino horn, as well as false statements 
as to its healing powers or effects.'

Elephants too are dying, with six, including four calves, killed last month on Daphne's doorstep, in Tsavo East National Park.

The
 worsening situation has put the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust's orphan 
project under increasing strain, with even Daphne admitting to wondering
 where it will all end.

'If I could choose a species to raise, it probably wouldn't be elephants,' she confesses. 'Getting so 
attached to these extraordinary animals and then having to deal with all the 
trauma and heartbreak over the years has been very difficult to bear. 

'Seeing poaching in action, as we do, and seeing the suffering elephants experience is 
extremely painful.

'More often than not, you feel as if your best efforts just aren't enough. It's frankly illogical to me that we should choose to kill a 
species so intelligent and so beautiful just to create trinkets.'

But despite her heartbreak, Daphne says she couldn't imagine living any other way and adds that she hopes people will pull together to help defeat the poaching menace.

'I truly love all animals,' she adds. 'People often 
assume elephants are my favourite but there are lots other species that
 I adore. Apart from the big cats, I have raised just about every sort of animal imaginable over the years and every one has been remarkable.'

Not quite as remarkable, you might think, as Daphne herself.
