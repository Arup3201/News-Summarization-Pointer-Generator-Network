When James and Emily Bradshaw made a commitment last  January to buy only British products, they knew this Christmas was going to be a challenge.  Toys for their three-year-old son Lucan were likely to present a problem, as was finding non-Chinese tinsel.

Yet even they didn’t predict they’d have to forgo lighting the Christmas pudding this year. They couldn’t find any British matches.

‘It was a bit of a surprise,’ admits James, a former lawyer from Westerham in Kent. ‘The match industry in the UK is famous but now even the brand England’s Glory, which has the big Union Flag on the box, says England’s Glory Made In Sweden.’

British Christmas: The Bradshaw family have been buying UK productions for the duration of 2013 and were surprised to find that buying British has been cheaper than buying from abroad

The irony is not lost on the Bradshaws, the self-styled, ‘truly British family,’ who have spent the last 12 months buying only goods made in the UK and services supplied by British firms.

Everything from the clothes they wear to the wine they drink to the electricity that powers their two-bedroomed semi has been made or provided by a British company.

James, 35, and Emily, a 30-year-old teacher, decided to embark on the project after reading about how little tax multi-national companies such as Amazon pay while small UK firms continue to struggle.

And as they approach the end of the year, their venture, championed by The Mail on Sunday, has led to some unexpected discoveries, not least that buying British has been cheaper than buying from abroad.

James says: ‘We are consistently 
finding that British products are cheaper. That’s mainly because to buy 
British food means buying what is in season and, where possible, 
preserving them for eating at other times of year. 

‘Supermarkets aren’t a cheap option for buying food – though their marketing would suggest they are.’

The
Bradshaws expected to find clothing more difficult. While the British 
luxury goods sector is thriving, the high-street relies heavily on 
foreign imports. 

Emily 
says: ‘There’s a manufacturer who produces jeans in Wales, but they are 
perhaps not suitable to most frames, and they’re £350 a pair.

'But 
I got my dress from Closet Clothing in East London for £30.

'That is 
probably less than you would spend in Next or M&S. So options are 
limited, but when I found that company all of a sudden I could buy 
clothes.’

Challenging the 
preconception that it is difficult to buy British has been one of the 
most interesting parts of the experiment for James.

He says: ‘Our story 
is a positive one in that we can say that Britain is able to produce 
things that rival any importer.’

There is also an important economic argument. 

James explains: ‘An economist told us that if everybody in the UK spent an extra £11 a week on British-made goods, it would help reduce the trade deficit within 12 months.

‘That’s the power the consumer has on the economy.

'We’ve got to understand our place as consumers is very strong. But it is only strong if the stuff is there for us to choose.’

The latest challenge for the Bradshaw family has been to put together a family Christmas.

The decorations have been ordered from a handmade crafts website, folksy.com, and they also found tinsel in South Wales.

Meanwhile, a London business called The Christmas Forest sells British-grown trees.

The Bradshaws have praised John Lewis and Waitrose for their efforts to back UK-made goods, and they provided British paper chains. 

A spokesperson for John Lewis said: ‘Last year we increased the number of UK suppliers by 57 per cent and we have set ourselves the target of increasing sales of UK-made products by 15 per cent by the end of 2015.’

The biggest problem was finding anything suitable for Lucan’s stocking.

Emily says: ‘I wanted to buy Lucan some Stickle Bricks but you can’t get British ones any more.’

But at least one traditional Christmas present staple – the Airfix model –  is about to be made in Britain again after company owners Hornby reversed a decision made in the early 2000s to use factories in China.

The only rule the Bradshaws set themselves was to buy products from British firms manufacturing in Britain, although they quickly realised the system made this difficult to stick to.

James explains: ‘For every sector the term “manufacturing” means something different.

‘On a mug, for example, it may say “made in Britain” but it could have been made in China and then transfer printed in the UK.’

And in this global age they have had to make some compromises.

The couple have maintained their Twitter account despite the fact it is an American company – and that has sometimes been crucial.

Emily says: ‘There have been times where we have been looking for a British product and we’ve thought, “It doesn’t exist.”  Then you’ll get someone who tweets “Have you heard of…?” You click the link and there it is.’

James says it is up to retailers to take responsibility and back British manufacturers.

‘So far we have found that British-made stuff, like clothes, is good quality and can be produced at a price that can still make firms a profit.

‘The manufacturing is there and is growing. The responsibility rests with retailers to stock this stuff.’

So, as the experiment draws to a close, what will the Bradshaws do next?

James says: ‘We always said we could end it if we wanted to but actually it feels less like an end and more we’re just setting out on this adventure.

We will carry on – but probably won’t be quite so strict with ourselves – as we’ve found buying British works for us.

‘We are not out to tell others how to live, but we’d like to help others who want to Buy British too.’

Toilet paper: Waitrose own-brand toilet roll (and 90 per cent of Waitrose own-brand products) are made in Britain.

Tea: The Bradshaws found an English tea grower, Tregothnan, right, in Cornwall.

Tablet computer: The Zoostorm  tablet, some components made abroad,  but final manufacture takes place in Warrington, Cheshire.

Lava lamp: The Mathmos lava lamp has been made in Britain since 1963.

Digital music Player: The Media Box Touch MP3/4.  Made in Britain by MCH Media  of Hertfordshire, slogan: British Made Fun.

Matches: The famous brand England’s Glory, right, is made in Sweden.

Lightbulbs: None made in Britain. The family have survived on a handful of old bulbs. They will have to compromise in 2014.

Tinned tomatoes: Emily bought fresh tomatoes and dried them for use out of season.

Batteries: None are British made. Bradshaws have eked out supplies this year, but another compromise is looming.

Printer Ink: None made in Britain – so the Bradshaws gave up printing from the computer.

Rice: Obviously not grown in UK. A staple the family have gone without.

Rubber gloves – Rubber is not grown in UK. Products are typically manufactured close to growers.

Social media: Twitter, a thoroughly American company, has been essential to their campaign.

Transport: James has bought a British-made Triumph motorbike.  But Emily still drives their Spanish car, a SEAT. They are considering a mini next year but their preferred model, the Countryman, is made  in Austria.

Toys: Very hard to find British-made toys. Three-year-old Lucan’s favourite is a Thomas the Tank Engine – made in China.
