A designer renowned for his unapologetic and explosive remarks is now showing his more generous side.

Karl Lagefeld is offering up a once in a lifetime opportunity to intern at Chanel - and selling it to the highest bidder at a charity auction.

Rich parents of teen fashionistas will no doubt be laying down bids in the hope of winning the priceless opportunity to shadow one of the biggest fashion designers in the world when it takes place next month.

The Love Ball fundraiser, held to raise money for Natalia Vodianova’s children’s charity The Naked Heart Foundation, will sell off the internship as one of 12 unforgettable experiences.

Other prizes include watching an opera in a private royal box and playing tennis with a top-ranked professional.

Scheduled for 27 July in Monaco, it is being held with the patronage of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, and Charlene, Princess of Monaco.

'Every member of the family has been 
incredibly generous,' Vodianova told WWD. The model aims to raise five million euros, or £4.4 million 
at current exchange with the event.

The reining monarchs are providing the 
venue - the grand Opéra de Monte Carlo - along with several auction lots
and accommodation for guests and the production team.

Vodianova's gala dinner will be Seventies Riviera themed, and will feature classical music performances, including ones by elite Russian conductor Valery Gergiev who is to arrive directly from a premiere in Saint Petersburg.

Guests will head to a nearby casino for charity gambling following the auction.

'I find gambling can be so glamorous, and very Monte Carlo,' said Vodianova.

The three previous Love Balls have generated about 70 per cent of of the revenue for Naked Heart, which aids underprivileged and special-needs children in Russia. To date, it has funded 90 play parks in 68 Russian cities, along with various support programs.

Belle du Seigneur, the feature film in which Vodianova stars opposite Jonathan Rhys Meyers, is slated for a June 19 release in France.
