Labour's shadow education secretary has been accused of ‘denigrating’ Catholicism after he appeared to question whether nuns make good teachers.

Tristram Hunt was criticised for comments he made on the BBC’s Question Time that seemed to challenge the quality of teaching provided by nuns.

The remarks immediately sparked a furious reaction with the former TV historian condemned for being ‘rude’ and ‘arrogant’, but he has refused to apologise.

Tristram Hunt was criticised for comments he made on the BBC’s Question Time that seemed to challenge the quality of teaching provided by nuns

During a debate over Labour's policy of requiring all teachers to have official qualifications on Thursday night, Mr Hunt clashed with fellow panellist Cristina Odone, a former editor of the Catholic Herald.

The political commentator said some of her most inspiring teachers did not go to teacher training college and taught 'real values'.

But Mr Hunt interjected: 'These were nuns, these were all nuns, weren't they?'

He added: 'I know about your religious schooling and there is a difference between a State education system and having qualified teachers in the classroom.'

Mr Hunt, who has opposed the use of unqualified teachers in classrooms, said: ‘I know about your religious schooling and there's a difference, I think, between a state education system having qualified teachers in the classroom.’

Miss Odone said she had been to a Catholic school, a state school and a private school and ‘the best (teachers) did not come out of teacher training college’.

Following the exchanges on BBC's Question Time Miss Odone told her former publication: ‘Tristram Hunt's comments on nuns last night were arrogant and ignorant.

‘Why is it acceptable to denigrate anything Catholic but bleat tolerance about every other religion?

‘To know he and Labour stand a chance at the next election makes me fear for the 7,000 brilliant faith schools in this country.’

Mr Hunt's remarks also led to outrage on Twitter. Tory MP Conor Burns said: 'Absolutely shocking, sneering comments by Tristram Hunt about Catholic schools and nuns.

'I was educated by Brothers. Gave lives of service.' Former Labour Downing Street spin doctor Damian McBride said:

'My mum spent most of her career teaching in a convent school, working alongside nuns. They gave incredible educations.'

Fellow Tory Nadine Dorries said it was an ‘arrogant, sneering, intolerant remark’ and predicted it would damage Labour's electoral chances.

‘If Labour had any chance of holding onto its Catholic Glasgow seats, it lost it last night with Tristram Hunt's remarks,’ she said.

Mr Hunt today responded to the row, but did not say sorry. He posted on Twitter: ‘On BBC QT I was trying to make a generalised point about the use of unqualified teachers in schools. I obviously meant no offence to nuns.’

Asked whether David Cameron believed nuns could make good teachers, a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister thinks that there are a range of people who are well-qualified to be excellent teachers and it is obviously for headteachers to make those decisions on the ground.

‘What matters most is that children are getting the best quality education they can.’

Paul Barber, director of the Catholic Education Service, said: ‘Nuns and religious orders play a central role in the continuing success of Catholic education. Religious orders provided education in this country centuries before state funded education and they continue this work today.

‘They act as qualified teachers, school chaplains, governors and trustees. The vocational nature of religious life and their dedication to serving the poor and vulnerable has meant that hundreds of thousands of students have been given a first class education.’

Speaking after the programme, Miss Odone said  Mr Hunt's comments on nuns 'were arrogant and ignorant'

A total of 26 Labour MPs went to Catholic schools, including six members of the shadow cabinet and shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan. Mr Hunt went to the fee-paying University College School in north London.

The row comes days after Mr Hunt told a parent asking about Labour's plans for schools to 'stop moaning' and 'do some work'.

Thomas Mann asked on Twitter if Mr Hunt could point him towards his education policies ahead of the general election.

Mr Hunt replied with a link to Labour's website. But Mr Mann, from south London, responded that the site 'only contains soundbites' and asked for details covering 'the full complexity of education policy'.

Mr Hunt then told Mr Mann: 'Stop moaning. Read the speeches. Do some work.'

Mr Mann, a former Labour voter, tweeted back: 'Tell Ed you just lost a vote.'

He added that he thought Mr Hunt was 'rude' and 'unhelpful'.

'He didn't even feign interest. He just got cross that we were asking him to earn his keep,' he wrote.

'I want a party that listens between elections. Remember who employs you.'

Mr Mann said that education policy had become important to him after his child's school in Lewisham had become an academy.
