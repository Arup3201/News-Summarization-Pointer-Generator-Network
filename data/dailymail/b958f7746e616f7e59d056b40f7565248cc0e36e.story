The hunt for all those behind the Lockerbie bombing goes on and Scotland’s top law officer has visited Libya with the head of the FBI to discuss the manhunt.

Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland and Robert Mueller travelled to Tripoli last week to meet the Libyan prime minister.

They want to pave the way for investigators to visit the country to hunt for the others responsible for Britain’s worst mass murder.

Lockerbie: Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland has visited Libya with FBI director Robert Mueller to discuss the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing

The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (Copfs) said the meeting, which took place on Wednesday April 25, was not publicised at the time for security reasons.

A spokesman said: ‘The Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland QC, and Robert S Mueller, director of the FBI, met with the Libyan prime minister Abdurahim el-Keib to discuss the ongoing investigation into the Lockerbie bombing.

‘The Libyan authorities confirmed that they fully understood the importance of dealing with the tragic issues left behind by Colonel Gaddafi and his regime, both in Libya and overseas.

‘The Lord Advocate expressed his desire to the Libyan prime minister that there will be a positive response to his recent request for co-operation and the international letter of request (ILOR)’.

A total of 270 people were killed when Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Dumfries-shire four days before Christmas in 1988.

Moammar Gadhafi's daughter Aisha has renewed her calls for the United Nations Security Council to investigate her fathers death as a possible war crime, CNN reports.

Ms Gadhafi, a lawyer, first made the call last year and was told a strategy for any investigation would be outlined to the Security Council this month.

Ms Gadhafi's father ruled Libya for nearly 42 years, but was killed in October by Libyan opposition forces.

Gadhafi was initially captured alive and unharmed as troops overran his hometown of Sirte.

According to Mahmoud Jibril, then Libya's interim prime minister, a gunbattle broke out as Gadhafi was being loaded into a vehicle leaving him with a wound to his right arm.

More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was hit in the head, Jibril said, with the former leader dying moments later.

Grainy video broadcast around the world showed the bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi being hauled onto a truck.

Another video showed a dead Gadhafi with what appeared to be a head wound.

Libya's U.S. ambassador Ali Aujalito said the National Transitional Council and the Libyan people wanted Gadhafi to be taken alive to answer for his crimes.

Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi was the only man convicted of the atrocity but it is widely accepted that he did not act alone.

He was sentenced to life in prison in 2001, but was released on ‘compassionate’ grounds from Greenock jail in Renfrewshire in August 2009 after being diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer.

At the time, doctors estimated he had around three months to live but he is still alive.

The decision to free the bomber generated international outrage and has dogged the SNP administration ever since it was made.

Last month, it was reported that Megrahi had been rushed to hospital for an emergency blood transfusion after his health ‘deteriorated quickly’.

In February this year, the Crown Office said a formal request had been sent to the Libyan government requesting access to the country for police and prosecutors involved in the investigation.

The Libyan National Transitional Council has previously confirmed to the UK Government that it will assist the ongoing criminal investigation, and agreed to allow officers from Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary to travel to Libya.

In March Megrahi marked his 60th birthday, thanking God for the ‘miracle’ of his survival and believing he ‘has been given time to prove his innocence.’

Megrahi published his ‘death bed memoirs’ earlier this year in which he protested his innocence.

Much of the book was based on evidence that was never heard, which was intended for an appeal the bomber abandoned.

In the book, he claimed he was indirectly pressured by Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill to drop the appeal in exchange for repatriation to Libya.

The SNP dismissed the claim as ‘hearsay’ - but Megrahi’s family are said to be ready to launch a new appeal after his death.

Megrahi’s freedom was largely due to work carried out by the Gaddafi regime and the dictator’s son, Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, who is currently in custody in Libya.

A new cancer treatment developed in London, but not yet widely available in the UK, has prolonged the bomber’s life.

He has been taking Abiraterone, a £3,000-a-month hormone-based therapy drug discovered at the Institute of Cancer Research.
