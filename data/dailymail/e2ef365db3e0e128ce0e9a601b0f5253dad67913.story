While Curiosity begins to explore the Martian surface, the moon may soon be home to another rover - and this one plans to mine.

Astrobotic Technology today revealed Polaris, a rover it hopes to send to the moon on top of a SpaceX rocket in October 2015.

It will search for ice that could help future explorers set up a moon base - and is powered by solat panels that give it the appearance of having a mohawk.

The Polaris rover is 5 ½ feet tall, 7 feet wide and
almost 8 feet long.

It can move at about a foot a second on 
2-foot-diameter composite wheels.

Its suspension will enable the rover to rise up over rough 
terrain, but also lower itself to the ground to perform drilling.

The 
rover will weigh 150 kilograms, or about 330 pounds, and can accommodate
a drill and science payload of up to 70 kilograms.

Polaris is a first of its kind solar-powered robot that will search for potentially rich deposits of water ice on the moon.

Observations
by NASA and Indian spacecraft suggest that a substantial amount of 
water ice could exist at the lunar poles.

That ice could be a source of 
water, fuel and oxygen for future expeditions, researchers say.

Polaris
can bore one meter into the lunar surface and 
can operate in lunar regions characterized by dark, long shadows and a 
sun that hugs the horizon.

It has been developed for an expedition to 
the moon's northern pole that would launch from Cape Canaveral on top of a 
SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

Polaris
is a flight prototype but has the same configuration as the rover that 
will eventually land on the moon.

It includes a number of flight-worthy 
components, including wheels and chassis beams constructed of light, but
tough composite materials.

This
will enable Astrobotic team members to spend the coming months testing 
and improving the robot's computer vision, navigation and planning 
software, and software that can plot the rover's position on the moon 
within 10 feet.

Polaris will have a drill capable of getting a metre under the lunar surface to look for sign of ice

Astrobotic — led by CMU's William "Red" Whittaker — develops robotics technology for planetary missions.

'It is the
first rover developed specifically for drilling lunar ice' said 
Whittaker.

Other robots built by the Field Robotics Center have
developed technologies necessary for lunar drilling, but none of them 
were ever meant to leave Earth.

'What
Polaris does is bring those many ideas together into a rover 
configuration that is capable of going to the moon to find ice,' 
Whittaker added.

To find 
the ice, a rover must operate as close to the dark poles as possible, 
but not so far that it can't use solar arrays for power, Whittaker said.

Polaris has three large solar arrays, arranged vertically to capture 
light from low on the horizon.

The solar arrays will be capable of an average of 250 watts of electrical power.

Polaris
also makes use of software, pioneered in CMU's NASA-funded Hyperion 
robot, that keeps track of the rover's position relative to the sun's 
rays to maximize solar energy and husbands battery power for use in the 
long shadows and dark regions found at the poles.

Whittaker said the lunar day lasts about 14 Earth days, though only 
about 10 days are suitable for water prospecting at the poles.

The Astrobotic team expects Polaris 
could drill 10 to 100 holes during that time as it locates and 
characterizes water ice deposits.

Astrobotic, in partnership with CMU, is also vying for the Google Lunar X Prize of more than $20 million.

Polaris is one of two Moon rovers under development by Astrobotic in competition for the Google contest, which offers a total of $30m in awards to privately funded projects exploring the Moon.

First prize – $20m – will be awarded to the company that can 'safely land a robot on the surface of the Moon, have that robot travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send video, images and data back to the Earth.'

If Polaris successfully survives the long, frigid lunar nights, as anticipated, the prospecting mission could be extended indefinitely.

Astrobotic has won nine lunar contracts from NASA worth $3.6 million, including one to evaluate how Polaris can accommodate NASA's ice-prospecting instruments during a three-mile traverse near the moon's north pole.
