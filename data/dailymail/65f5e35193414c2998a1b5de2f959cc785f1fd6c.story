Julian Speroni was the hero for Crystal Palace, superbly saving an 84th minute penalty to secure a draw for his side.

The Argentine, who had been linked with a move away from Selhurst Park this summer, proved his worth to the Eagles again when he got a strong hand to Scott Arfield’s spot kick.

It was an excellent save celebrated raucously all round Selhurst Park but nobody was as relieved as Mile Jedinak.

Crystal Palace go close to beaking the deadlock against Burnley at Selhurst Park on Saturday

Crystal Palace (4-4-1-1): Speroni 7.5; Ward 6, Dann 5, Delaney 5, Mariappa 5.5; Puncheon 6.5, Jedinak (c) 5, McArthur 6, Campbell 5; Zaha 5.5; Gayle 6

Subs not used: Hennessey, Fryers, Kelly, Ledley, Williams, Ledley, Bolasie, Doyle.

Burnley (4-4-2): Heaton 5; Trippier 5, Duff 5.5, Shackell (c) 6, Mee 5; Arfield 4.5, Marney 5, Jones 5, Jutkiewicz 6; Boyd 5, Ings 4.5 (Sordell 42 5)

Subs not used: Gilks, Reid, Ward, Wallace, Sordell, Long, Barnes

Managers: Neil Warnock 5, Sean Dyche 6

Referee: Mike Dean 7

The Palace captain, so often the lynchpin in his side's midfield, had been below par all afternoon and his rugby tackle on Lukas Jutkiewicz in the box had referee Mike Dean rightly pointing to the spot.

Speroni had denied midfielder Arfield earlier in the game, making a fingertip save to keep out his powerful effort from 25 yards. 

The penalty was a more tame effort down the middle and at the right height for Speroni.

Burnley will be crestfallen having failed to take advantage of that gilt edged opportunity to secure a first victory since returning to the Premier League but a draw was probably a fair result. 

The real losers were the fans who were given false hope of an exciting contest after a pulsating opening ten minutes.

Neil Warnock has made a point of stating that he wanted the side that rocketed to 11th under Tony Pulis by being watertight in defence to evolve into a more attacking unit that would entertain.

It seemed they might live up to that billing initially. 

Wilfried Zaha, who was given a raucous reception when the stadium announcer read out his name, almost helped Palace to an early goal from Jason Puncheon’s short corner. He cut the ball back inside the box to find Damien Delaney in space but the defender blasted over. 

Zaha’s pace and dizzying step overs confounded the Burnley defence.

After Frazier Campbell doggedly won the ball in midfield he released Zaha to burst down the wing and into the box where his right footed strike was spilled by keeper Tom Heaton and required defender Jason Shakell to clear off the line.

Another chance went begging when Michael Duff’s botched header fell to Dwight Gayle, who had plenty of time to pick out his shot but he sent the ball soaring over the cross bar.

George Boyd made his debut for Burnley in place of the injured Matt Taylor. 

The boyhood Crystal Palace fan was subject to jeers from the stands, with fans recalling how he opted to join Nottingham Forest instead of Palace last year. He saw plenty of the ball and looked lively but was unable to capitalise on a few half chances. 

Palace had a flurry of chances at the start of the second half. 

First, Dwight Gayle was unable to connect with a Mile Jedinak header in the box. Then Damien Delaney headed into the side netting from a Jason Puncheon corner.

At the other end, Speroni was given his first proper test of the afternoon with an hour played, when forced into a fingertips save of Scott Arfield’s powerful shot from 25 yards out.

There was disappointment for former non-league man Danny Ings, who looked in agony as he pulled up with what looked like a torn hamstring.

The 22-year-old who played non-league after being released by Southampton has worked tirelessly to get into the Premier League with Burnley, was close to tears in the dugout.
