The California home where Steve Jobs made the first Apple computers in his garage has been designated a historic site.

The Los Altos ranch-style house where the tech legend first launched his hugely successful company has been named a 'historic resource' by the town's historical commission.

The vote was unanimous, and will preserve the home exactly as it stand, according to the San Jose Mercury News.

Unexpected landmark: The boyhood home where Steve Jobs grew up is up for historic status

Starting point: Jobs and Steve Wozniak (pictured here in 1976) built their first 50 computers in the garage

'The documentation looks very complete, better than some of the books as far as accuracy goes,' historical commission chair Frank Bishop told the paper.

The designation was made without current owner Patricia Jobs, the Apple founder's sister, permission, according to the Mercury News.

She did speak to the board and has not raised any objections, Mr Bishop noted.

Mr Jobs moved into the house with his family when he was in 7th grade, eventually building his first personal computers in the garage.

The humble beginnings of the massive technology company have played an important role in the mythology of Apple and Mr Jobs.

The garage was the spot where Jobs and his friends Steve Wozniak and Bill Fernandez worked on the first iteration of a computer. In the official biography of the Apple founder, Mr Jobs said that he and Wozniak built their first 50 computers in the garage.

A similar house was used in the filming of the latest film about Mr Jobs' life.

The actual three-bedroom home on Crist Drive is valued at $1.5million and is not for sale.

While
the push for the entrepreneur's boyhood home has been logged down by 
bureaucratic paperwork for the past two years, Mr Jobs left some of his own
historical mementos behind well before he died in 2011.

Just last week, a time capsule that he buried at a conference in Aspen, Colorado in 1983 was discovered and it contained the very first commercially-available computer mouse that his team had created.
