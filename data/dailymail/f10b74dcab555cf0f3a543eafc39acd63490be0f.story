Raymond Maxwell was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern affairs when al-Qaeda-linked militants stormed a US diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya and killed four Americans

U.S. State Department officials conspired to prevent an internal Accountability Review Board from seeing damning documents after the 2012 Benghazi terror attack which made then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton look bad, according to a former senior diplomat.

A picture has emerged of a weekend boiler-room operation in which employees were instructed to sift through boxes of documents and 'pull out' anything that might make Clinton or her close associates look bad in the wake of the terrorist murders of four Americans including the ambassador to Libya.

Raymond Maxwell, a former deputy assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, claims he was scapegoated after the raid by militants acting with Ansar al-Shariah, an Islamist terror faction linked with al-Qaeda.

He told The Daily Signal, a news outlet operated by the conservative Heritage Foundation, that a room in the basement of the State Department was converted to a makeshift document review center on a weekend, supervised by Clinton confidants.

'I was not invited to that after-hours endeavor, but I heard about it and decided to check it out on a Sunday afternoon,' Maxwell said. 

Inside, says Maxwell, employees – including one who reported to him – were busily covering up information that suggested higher-ups were responsible for the lax security at the U.S. diplomatic outpost in Benghazi Libya.

Maxwell claims State Department higher-ups close to then-Secretary Hillary Clinton worked over a weekend to scrub boxes of documents of anything that might make her look bad, before giving them to investigators

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, shown Sunday at a political event in Iowa, was officially cleared of wrongdoing by an internal review board, even though it never interviewed her

The September 11 attack two years ago followed a separate bombing of the facility's outer wall four months earlier that left a giant hole. Days later, Ansar al-Shariah held two days of open-air rallies and parades including 30 fighting battalions in the city's main square.

Speakers warned of 'assassinations' that would come. 

Clinton – the Democratic Party's front-runner in the 2016 presidential sweepstakes – and others at State have been criticized for denying repeated requests from Ambassador Chris Stevens for more security officers, including some that came after these events. .

Maxwell was one of four officials officially saddled with responsibility. He was later cleared of wrongdoing.  

He was, however, placed on indefinite leave, with pay, while the State Department investigated.

Struggling to clear his name, Maxwell met with an agency ombudsman who he says told him, 'You are taking this all too personally, Raymond. ... It’s not about you; it’s about Hillary and 2016.' 

Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, whose organization has dented the Obama administration's Benghazi armor with a series of Freedom Of Information Act lawsuits, told MailOnline that 'Maxwell’s disclosures are no surprise to those of us who know the Clintons' penchant for illicit secrecy.'

'The Benghazi cover-up was and is about protecting two presidential campaigns – Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and Hillary’s nascent 2016 campaign,' Fitton said.

'Our Ambassador and three other American personnel die in a terrorist attack and the number one concern at State is protecting Hillary Clinton! First we have the supposedly missing IRS emails and now we may have missing Benghazi documents?' 

In May 2013 The Daily Beast interviewed American Foreign Service Association president Susan Johnson, who said disciplinary action meted out to diplomats like Maxwell creates 'a feeling that foreign-service officers often end up as scapegoats when scandals rise to congressional or public attention.' 

Maxwell told The Daily Signal that the weekend cover-up was held in a basement room at State Department headquarters. He witnessed senior Clinton aides overseeing the process of employees poring over boxes and stacks of documents.

One of the worker-bees was an office director, his subordinate, who was recruited to help without his knowledge.

'She told me, "Ray, we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [Near Eastern Affairs] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light",' she allegedly told Maxwell.  

Ansar al-Shariah, the terrorist group that laid waste to the US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, held two days of threatening parades and rallies a few months earlier and called for 'assassinations' -- leading to questions about why security at the compound was lacking

'What difference, at this point, does it make?' Clinton famously snapped in a 2013 Senate hearing when confronted with the tall tale that an anti-Islam YouTube video, not a terror plot, sparked the death and destruction in Sept. 11, 2012

Maxwell said that when he asked her to explain herself, she responded that 'those are our orders.'

The seventh floor of the State Department is the showplace level that houses Clinton's office and those of her closest aides.

The agency's official Accountability Review Board tasked with investigating the Benghazi attack never interviewed Hillary Clinton. A month after the deadly military-style assault, the panel's leaders demanded to see documents that could help explain what happened.

Top leaders of the of the State Department’s Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs were instructed to gather anything and everything that could help.

Those documents, Maxwell told The Daily Signal, were boxed up and put in the basement room where Clinton insiders would later screen out the most damaging information before giving the ARB the rest.

He called the investigation 'at best a shoddily executed attempt at damage control, both in Foggy Bottom and on Capitol Hill.'

State Department spokesman Alec Gerlach calls Maxwell's accusations 'totally without merit.'

But Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who will serve on a special congressional committee empaneled to investigation the deadly Benghazi episode, told the news outlet that Maxwell's charges 'are as serious as it gets, and it’s something we have obviously followed up and pursued.'

'I'm 100 percent confident the Benghazi Select Committee is going to dive deep on that issue.'
