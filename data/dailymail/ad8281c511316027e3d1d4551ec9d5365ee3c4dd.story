Smiling for the camera, they look like typical newlyweds enjoying a boat trip during their honeymoon.

But within weeks Shasta Khan, 38, and her husband Mohammed, 33, ditched their westernised lifestyle and became terrorists intent on plotting to murder members of the Jewish community on British soil.

A court heard the couple planned to use chapati flour, bleach and Christmas tree lights to make a bomb and carried out reconnaissance for targets.

Couple:
 Mohammed and Shasta on their honeymoon in Turkey. A satnav from her 
Peugeout 305 showed the couple had been on multiple trips to Jewish 
populated areas around Manchester looking for targets to attack

Convicted: Shasta Khan, 38, left, and her husband, 
Mohammed Sajid Khan, 33, right, bought substances and equipment from 
supermarkets to assemble an improvised explosive device. Both will be sentenced tomorrow

Their activities were discovered only 
by chance when police were called to a domestic disturbance at their 
terraced home in Oldham.

Officers who searched the property 
discovered propaganda glorifying Osama Bin Laden, guides to bomb-making 
and a video from 2004 of British hostage Ken Bigley being beheaded in 
Iraq.

Yesterday British-born Mrs Khan, who 
has an 18-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, screamed and wept 
as she was convicted of engaging in preparation for terrorism and two 
counts of possessing information useful for terrorism.

Terrorism: Interior and exterior pictures of the couple's house in Oldham, Manchester. Prosecutors said behind their 'apparent normality of daily life' the couple planned to carry out 'jihad at home' after becoming radicalised

She was cleared of a third count of 
the latter charge. Her husband had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing 
to preparation for acts of terrorism. Both will be sentenced today.

Manchester Crown Court heard that Mrs 
Khan, who ran a hair salon, met her husband on the ‘Single Muslim’ 
dating site in July 2010 after turning to religion following the 
breakdown of her two previous marriages.

She agreed to marry him just three 
days after they met and they enjoyed a honeymoon in Turkey, but within 
weeks she got rid of her westernised clothes and stopped watching TV 
soaps, which he claimed were a ‘bad influence’. Instead, the couple 
tuned into Al Qaeda-inspired propaganda online.

Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, said 
behind their ‘apparent normality of daily life’, unemployed car valeter 
Khan and his wife were planning an attack, with the most likely target 
being an Orthodox Jewish area of Prestwich, North Manchester.

Chemicals used in Mrs Khan’s work, such 
as bleach, left, acetone and peroxide, were capable of being 
transformed into explosives. Right is a digital frequency radio used in reconnaissance missions

But their plans were foiled in July 
last year, when police were called to the couple’s home following a 
family row during which Khan attacked his father-in-law.

One of Mrs Khan’s brothers told 
officers: ‘We have something I think may be interesting to you. I think 
he’s a homegrown terrorist.’

Mrs Khan agreed to ‘spill the beans’ 
about her husband’s activities, but evidence later came to light which 
proved they were both in on the plans and she too was arrested and 
charged.

Among the items found by police was an
 article from an Al Qaeda magazine, entitled ‘Make a bomb in the kitchen
 of your Mom’, which also offered a step-by-step guide on how to create 
an explosive capable of killing ‘at least ten people’.

Mrs Khan told the jury her husband was a ‘racist’, who said she did not believe in Allah because she mixed with white people.

But the jury rejected Mrs Khan’s version of events and agreed with the prosecution case that the couple were acting together.

Found by police: Seemingly innocuous and innocent items like these Christmas tree lights, bulbs and a battery found at the address had a more sinister purpose the jury was told. This was one of the most significant finds

A close-up of the electrical items found in the Maplin bag. Ground-up fire lighters, safety goggles, a funnel, needles and syringes were also part of the paraphernalia found a the couple's address

This post it notes found at the house made references to a Tokarev gun and right, this metal pan was found in the rear garden. Shasta Khan told the jury she had no involvement in terrorism or her husband’s activities
