'Bully': John Yates has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years for the murder of his wife Barbara

A 'possessive and violent' bully who killed his estranged wife then drove her body in the boot of his car to a police station will serve at least 18 years in jail.

John Yates, 58, who had been found guilty of murder, was told by a judge at Caernarfon crown court in North Wales that he had done everything in his power to prevent his wife Barbara from leading her own life.

Following the murder somewhere in the Warrington area he drove her body in the boot of his Peugeot 306 estate to a police traffic base 45 miles away at St Asaph where he handed himself in.

Speaking outside court today, Barbara's older sister Angela Hyland, of Glossop, 
Derbyshire, said: 'I hope he dies in prison. He was very possessive, 
selfish, controlling and jealous.

'If he couldn’t have her he wouldn’t 
let anyone else have Barbara. She was living a life of fear.'

Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said Yates had subjected her to a 'brutal and sustained' attack last July.

A pathologist suggested there were numerous blows to the head with a weapon.

Mrs Yates, 49, a mother-of-two and his wife and partner for more than 30 years, was also strangled.

They met when she was 18 in a Manchester club. She was a taxi escort for disabled children.

But Yates had been violent and abusive towards her their entire relationship, the court heard yesterday.

Victim: Barbara Yates had been with John since the age of 18 after meeting him in a Manchester club

Brutal attack: A judge at Caernarfon Crown Court said John Yates had been 'possessive' and 'violent' towards his wife 'from the outset'

Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, said Mrs Yates had told her sister that her husband had once locked her in a cupboard. 

In 1987, she was admitted to hospital after he allegedly punched her repeatedly, tried to strangle her and banged her head on a car dashboard. 

But in 2009, Mrs Yates decided she couldn't take anymore and finally left her abusive husband.

But he was jealous of her new life.

In 2011 she was taken to hospital after a 'prolonged assault' by him. At one stage he allegedly got a hammer and hit her over the head. 

Guilty: The court heard how John Yates had behaved violenty towards his wife for 30 years

Mrs Yates, a taxi escort for disabled children, had also described how her husband went berserk after being refused sex.

But she withdrew a complaint against him. Seven months later, on July 18, she was killed.

Police still do not know exactly where the murder took place.

Judge Hughes told him : 'From the outset you behaved in a possessive and violent manner towards her.'

Eventually he hadn’t wanted to lose his home as a result of her seeking a divorce.

Judge Hughes told Yates : 'Your killing of her was premeditated and had been in your mind for some weeks prior to her death.'

Imposing a life sentence, the judge 
told Yates, of Derby Drive, Padgate, Warrington, who once worked for a 
skip hire firm, he would serve a minimum of 18 years behind bars less 
time remanded in custody.

Defence QC Stephen Riordan said Yates had been under stress for some time and suffered from depression.

North
 Wales Police welcomed the sentence. Acting Detective Chief Inspector 
Iestyn Davies said 'John Yates has been convicted of a sustained attack 
on his wife Barbara that has ultimately led to her death.

'Barbara Yates was subjected to domestic abuse at the hands of John Yates on many occasions and tragically found herself unable to break free from this abusive and violent relationship.'
