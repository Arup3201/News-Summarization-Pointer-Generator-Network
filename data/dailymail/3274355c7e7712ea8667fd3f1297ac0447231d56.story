Apple has already begun manufacturing the iPhone 5S, which will be revealed in April and go on sale in August, it was claimed today.

The new model is believed to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but include a faster processor and updated camera, according to online reports from website iMore.

It also claims that new iPad models are set to be announced in April, including a new version of the firm's hugely successful iPad Mini with an upgraded screen.

'iMore has learned that Apple is planning the release of the iPhone 5S for this summer, currently for August,' the site said.

'Next generation iPads, presumably the iPad 5 and potentially the iPad mini 2, may also debut as soon as this April,' it added.

'If these plans stick, we should be in for a fun spring and summer.'

It comes as Japanese Apple blog MacOtakara reported that Foxconn is starting to ramp up production of Apple's iPhone 5 successor, according to AppleInsider. 

It claims that because the design of the 'iPhone 5S' is substantially the same as the company's existing handset, little to no tooling is needed to manufacture the two models on the same production lines.

The claims echo those made by Peter Misek of investment bank Jeffries earlier this year, who said Apple will begin making a new iPhone model in March for an expected launch in June or July.

Mr Misek predicted that iPhone sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model, but he nonetheless said he expects around 44 million to ship in the quarter to March.

'As word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread, we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand CQ1 in anticipation of the new product launch and Apple will likely start curtailing channel inventory,' he was quoted as saying by StreetInsider.

'Therefore we tweak down our CQ1 iPhone shipment estimate from 48M to 44M, which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid-30Ms.'

The analyst's prediction of a summer launch date for the 5S is a reiteration of claims he made last month, when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life.

Apple will launch five new products in the next 12 months, including its highly anticipated TV set, two leading analysts claimed today.

Analysts Gene Munster and Douglas Clinton of Piper Jaffray say the firm will launch a plethora of new products in a bid to keep its position as the world's biggest company.

However, the analysts say the new gadgets could be just the beginning of a major change in Apple's products in 2014.

The pair told Fortune magazine 2013 'will set the stage for bigger changes in the product lineup in 2014 and beyond.'

Apple is believed to develop products several years in advance, with its design team, led by British-born Sir Jonathan Ive, producing hundreds of prototype products each year.

The speculation seemed to contradict comments made by Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, who recently told Chinese newspaper the Shanghai Evening News that 'despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this well never be the future of Apple's products.'

Mr Misek's predictions came as a string of analysts suggested that Apple's decision to slash orders for iPhone 5 components might not be a result of weak demand for the device.

Earlier this year, MailOnline Science reported how the iconic gadget company had told suppliers it only wanted half the number of screens it had originally asked for and reduced orders for other parts too.

Apple is said to have have told its suppliers about the change last month. It will apply to orders from now until the end of March and comes after Apple has come under intense pressure from Samsung and other phones which use Google’s Android operating system.

But Shaw Wu, an analyst with brokers Sterne Agee, was quoted by the Telegraph as telling investors that 'as far as we can tell, iPhone 5 demand remains robust.'

He added that the change in orders could be down to 'much improved yields meaning lower component builds and supplier shifts.'
