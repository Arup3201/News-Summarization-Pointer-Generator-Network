From bad fashion choices to an undying devotion to boy bands, writer Alison Perry, 35, took a trip down memory lane in a recent blog post as she remembered the highs and lows of being a teenager in the 90s.

The post had some members of the FEMAIL team crying with laughter, while the younger writers looked blank at the mentions of Live & Kicking or a trip to Blockbuster on a Saturday night.

Here we have reprinted 15 of our favourites, to read the full blog post and more from Alison visit her blog notanothermummyblog.com.

It was acceptable in the 90s: Alison Perry lists the things most 90s teenage girls will have experienced 

1. It wasn’t Saturday afternoon without a visit to The Body Shop to spend your pocket money on a kiwi lip balm. Or if you were splashing out, White Musk perfume.

2. You were addicted to playing Tetris on the GameBoy. And you may have owned a Tamagotchi.

3. You went to see Titanic at the cinema three times – and cried when Leo died, every time ('Jack! Come back!') 

4. You decided if you ever got a tattoo, it would be Mark Owen's dolphin or Mel C's celtic arm chain. Both totally amazing. 

Virtual friend: A Tamogotchi was a girls best friend as a 90s teen

Style icon: Tattoo inspiration would have come from none other than Mel C, whose chain arm band was the envy of many teenage girls 

5. School holidays were spent watching Saved By The Bell (you really wanted to be Kelly Kapowski), listening to Pulp, Blur and Oasis on your Walkman and avoiding any homework or revision.   

6. Thanks to Neighbours and Home & Away, you thought Australia was the best place ever, and you perfected your Aussie accent by saying phrases like 'Let's jump in the ute!', 'Have you fed the chooks?' and 'Strewth, mate!' 

7. You had to wait until 6pm to call your friends, to get the cheaper call rate. Then you'd spend at least an hour chatting to them, despite having seen them that day at school.  

8. You cried when Robbie left Take That. And actually considered calling the helpline set up for distraught fans.

Heart breaking: For many teenage girls, the crisis of their youth came when Robbie Williams left Take That

Cult classic: When it came to film choices, Clueless was always up there

9. Your hair didn't thank you for the perm. Or the Sun-In bleach you sprayed on it. The Wella Toners and Shaders were much kinder to it. But the bright blue hair mascara just looked ridiculous.

10. Going to the video shop on a Saturday night was the highlight of the week. You'd spend at least ten minutes deciding whether to rent Clueless, Wayne's World or Speed.  

11. Why would you use a normal hair bobble when you could use a scrunchie?

12. You knew all the words to Let's Get Ready To Rhumble by PJ & Duncan. And at least two verses of Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise. 

13. Friends was something that was only on TV once a week. And every episode you watched was brand new! Oh happy days.  

14. You pretended you were too old for it, but Saturday mornings were all about sitting in your PJs, watching Going Live or Live And Kicking. Trev and Simon swinging their pants, Gordon the Gopher, Edd the Duck, Andi Peters – all heroes.  

15. You saw Mel Blatt from All Saints perform onstage with her baby bump hanging out of her crop top and cargo pants, and thought it was a look you'd definitely copy when you were grown up and had babies  

Saturday mornings: As much as you didn't want to admit it, the start to your weekend always involved watching Live and Kicking 

No repeats: Friends was only on once a week, and every episode was brand new 

Top tunes: Knowing the words to PJ & Duncan's Let's Get Ready to Rhumble was crucial
