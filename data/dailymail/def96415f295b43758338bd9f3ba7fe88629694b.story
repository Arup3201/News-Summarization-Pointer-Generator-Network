New York Times media columnist David Carr was remembered for his candid words, journalistic talent and 'unique combination of Minnesota nice and New York attitude' at a funeral mass on Tuesday.

Hundreds of mourners, ranging from Carr's relatives and colleagues to celebrities, paid their respects to the 58-year-old writer at the service at Manhattan's Church of St. Ignatius Loyola.

In attendance were Girls actress Lena Dunham, comedians Stephen Colbert and Tom Arnold, writer Gay Talese and the Times's publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr and executive editor, Dean Baquet.

During the mass, Carr's daughters, Meagan, Erin and Maddie, joined by his widow, Jill Rooney Carr, paid tribute to their father, who died last Thursday after collapsing in the Times's newsroom.

Meagan said she did not expect to meet 'another person who touched as many people as my dad did', while Erin remembered her father as 'a curious sort who wanted to know about everything'.

Meanwhile, Carr’s older brother, John, said the columnist was a mixture of 'Minnesota nice and New York attitude', adding that it had 'never occurred to us that we would say goodbye in this church'.

He noted that former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis were among the famous names to have been posthumously honored at the Upper East Side venue.

Before the service got underway, mourners were handed a funeral program featuring a quote from Carr, who battled crack cocaine addiction and alcoholism before joining the Times in 2002.

'I’m ecstatic in my own dark, morbid way and subscribe to the theory of the past that allows the future to unfold: We all did the best we could,' the quote read, according to the New York Daily News.

Dressed in black, the attendees then took their seats and listened to a homily from Rev James Martin, who described Carr, from New Jersey, as 'a complicated man' who had faith as well as doubts.

According to the Times, he declared he did not want to 'claim him as a kind of prize for the church, or trumpet his faith, or even point to him as the model Catholic or the model Christian; he wasn’t.'

'But, then again, no one is,” Father Martin added. 'All of us are imperfect, flawed, even sinful.'

The funeral came a day after a wake was held for Carr at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, during which family, friends and other mourners cried and laughed as they remembered the columnist.

During the wake, also in the Upper East Side, Carr's daughter Eric told attendees: 'I loved my dad, I loved him so much. I am so sad that he’s not here. But, good lord, he would have loved this!'

Speaking with a smile, she added: 'My dad was a crazy one'.

Meanwhile, Dunham said  she had recently asked Carr about the future of the Times and he had said 'he’d stay with it until it ran straight to the ground', according to a tweet from writer Tad Friend.

Another media attendee: On Tuesday, CNN correspondent Brian Stelter, who attended the wake, tweeted: 'At the wake tonight, David's widow Jill handed out these: reporter's notebooks from his stash at home'

The 28-year-old actress later took to Twitter herself, writing: 'You would have loved your wake, David. You DID love your wake. Laughter, tears, your beautiful girl gang family in the front row.'

During the service, Carr’s wife, Jill, handed out the father-of-three's old yellow reporter’s notebooks to mourners, according to a tweet by CNN correspondent Brian Stelter, who was also in attendance.

She then joined the columnists' daughters at the front of the chapel, where a huge black-and-white head shot of Carr beaming was propped against vases filled with lilies, the Daily Beast reported.

Alongside, the photos were two of Carr's pocket-sized reporter's notebooks, as well as one of his beloved cans of Diet Coke which had replaced his addiction to the drug of the same name, it is said.

Mourners were informed of Carr's penchant for dancing. One man, who only identified himself as Michael, said he had become close to the writer after meeting him at an AA meeting.

'If you haven’t seen David dance, it’s amazing,' he l recounted. 'I can’t tell if he’s the worst dancer I’ve ever seen or the best dancer I’ve ever seen. But he’s the least insecure dancer I’ve ever seen.'

Last Saturday, an autopsy revealed that Carr, who lived with his event planner wife and youngest daughter Maddie in Montclair, New Jersey, died of complications from metastatic lung cancer.

Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office, said the autopsy also showed that heart disease had contributed to the acclaimed columnist's death.

Before joining the Times, Carr was a contributing writer for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. He also was a media writer for news website Inside.com.

Carr served as editor of the Washington City Paper, an alternative weekly in Washington, D.C. He also was editor of a Minneapolis-based alternative weekly called Twin Cities Reader. 

Throughout his career, he was well known for writing about his personal life. In 2008, he penned a memoir, The Night of the Gun, in which he detailed his struggles with cocaine addiction.

In the hours before his death, Carr had expertly moderated a discussion on 'Citizenfour', a film about Edward J. Snowden and his leaking of documents about government surveillance.
