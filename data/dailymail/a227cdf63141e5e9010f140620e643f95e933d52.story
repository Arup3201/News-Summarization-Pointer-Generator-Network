Laura Farrell, 41, (pictured) died in the car crash after Sherri Torkington ran a red light

A mother-of-four who killed a woman in a car crash while driving in a 'fast and furious' manner following a row with her boyfriend was jailed for six years today.

A witness said Sheri Torkington, 32, was driving 'as if on a suicide mission' before she jumped a red light and smashed into Laura Farrell's car in Bolton, Greater Manchester.Â 

Mrs Farrell, 41, who was driving her husband Norman to work at the time, died at the scene.

Her husband, 54, suffered a broken neck, nine broken ribs, a broken collar-bone, three fractures to his pelvis and a punctured lung.

Passing sentence at Bolton Crown Court today, Judge Timothy Stead said Torkington deliberately drove through the red light.

Before the crash at about 3.30am in June 2011, Torkington had a blazing row with Phillip Holt, who she has since married.

One witness said she was woken at 3am and heard the couple 'shouting, screaming and yelling' at each other in a row over her ex-lover.

She had denied causing death by dangerous driving but was convicted at earlier following only 30 minutes of deliberation by the jury.

Judge Stead, who also banned Torkington from driving for six years, told her: 'You were in a 
considerable temper and you were taking your temper out in the way you 
drove.

'One witness said it was almost like handbrake turns, involving 
screeching and revving. She was so concerned, she said to her husband, 
you were either drunk, drugged-up or on a suicide mission.

'I am sure that what you decided to do, in the temper that you were in, 
was to drive across that junction, through a red light deliberately 
knowing that the light was set against you.

'This was a grossly dangerous
thing to do.

Torkington, right, had denied jumping the red light but was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison. Laura Farrell's husband Norman, left, suffered a broken neck in the crash but said the pain of his injuries did not compare to the pain of losing his wife

'Mr Farrell said his own physical pain was nothing next to what he is 
feeling because of the loss of his wife. That is something that has to 
be borne as part of your responsibility.'

During the trial the court heard that
after the row Torkington jumped into her Ford Fiesta and was seen to 
angrily revv up her car engine before wheel spinning.

She careered through residential streets 
in Bolton before ploughing into Mrs Farrell's Ford 
Focus at up to 45mph as the victim's car was going through a green 
light.

A cyclist saw Mrs Farrell, a HSBC bank clerk, driving through the green light when Torkington's car sped through 
the red light in the middle lane.

Her car pushed Mrs Farrell's vehicle 
into the crash barrier and then spun into the middle of the dual 
carriage way.

Mr Farrell who had been in a relationship with Laura for 23 years, but 
were only married for seven added: 'Laura took the car out of gear, 
coasting up to the lights which were on red - we must have been 
travelling at 10mph.

Torkington drove like she was on a 'suicide mission' before ploughing into Mrs Farrell's car at Turton Street, Bolton (pictured)

'The lights started to change as we were about 10 to15 metres away from 
the lights. I looked to the right and by the time I looked left all I 
could see was grey and a crunching noise and that's all I remember.'

In a victim impact statement he said had 
trouble sleeping and was being fed through a tube and a syringe because 
of on-going problems with his stomach.

Torkington of Halliwell, Bolton, who only
started driving in September 2010, later denied being angry after her 
bust up with her partner and denied speeding through the red light 
saying it was on amber.

She said she had watched Mr Holt play
pool at a pub but after they returned home they had a 'minor 
disagreement' after which she drove him to his daughter's house - 
leaving her then 14-year-old son to look after her other children.

Torkington sobbed: 'I vaguely 
remember the disagreement being about my ex. To me an argument is 
screaming and shouting at each other.'

She added: 'I have a plate in my left
leg, plate in my left arm. I had three broken metatarsals, a torn 
spleen, a fractured pelvis. I was cut from front to back. I hit my head 
severely. I was in hospital for three weeks.'

Following her conviction, Chief 
Inspector Rachel Buckle of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This woman 
had her life tragically cut short because of the actions of Sheri 
Torkington.

'At no point did she admit her guilt and subjected the victim's family to a lengthy trial.

'Torkington disregarded the law and 
drove at speed through a red light. Even a split second of carelessness 
can have devastating consequences and Torkington has to live with what 
she has done for the rest of her life.'
