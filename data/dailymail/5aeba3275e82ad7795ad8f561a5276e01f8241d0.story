Arsenal have a long history of giving youth a chance under Arsene Wenger, and look ready to do so again after handing Chiori Johnson and Tyrell Robinson professional contracts.

The duo will be looking to follow in the footsteps of first-team stars such as Jack Wilshere and Wojciech Szczesny.

Both just 17 years old, Johnson is a highly-rated right-back while Robinson has impressed on the left wing in the youth ranks, as well as in defence.

Serge Gnabry, Gedion Zelalem, Chuba Akpom and most recently Ainsley Maitland-Niles have all had opportunities to impress with the senior squad after coming through the ranks.

And local lads Johnson and Robinson look to be on the same path as both have already featured in the Under 21 Premier League and the UEFA Youth League (U19), with the latter scoring against Galatasaray last month.

Robinson, born in Basildon, is regarded as a fine prospect for the future and is extremely quick and skilful with good ball control going forward.

Johnson has been competing with fellow youngster Tafari Moore in recent years but will hope to prosper just as Hector Bellerin has, with his bursting overlapping runs from the right.

'What a great feeling to have signed my first professional contract at Arsenal F.C! Thanks to all who supported me,' the youngster tweeted on Monday after signing his deal.
