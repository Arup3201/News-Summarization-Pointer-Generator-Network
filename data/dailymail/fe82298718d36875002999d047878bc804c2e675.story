Its tear-jerking advert, featuring a boy who can't wait to give his parents a Christmas present, struck a chord with the British public.

Now it appears to have struck gold for John Lewis after the department store today announced record-breaking sales for last week.

The retail giant reported takings of £123.5million, - the most it has ever taken in a single week. This represents a rise of 2 per cent on like-for-like sales from last year.

Is this little guy to thank? The department store's tear-jerking festive advert, starring Lewis McGowan, has no doubt gone some way to driving sales

Last week's figures were up 8.7 per cent on the previous week's, to buck a general downward 
trend elsewhere on the high street.

Overall UK retail sales figures for 
December are not published until January, but November's figures were 
1.6 per cent lower on a like-for-like basis from November 2010, 
according to the British Retail Consortium.

Speaking to the Telegraph about the 
rise, John Lewis MD, Andy Street, said: 'Who would have bet on that at 
the end of October, given all the doom and gloom?

'Last
year, we outperformed the market for the whole of 2010 by 10 per cent. We also
outperformed at Christmas 2009 so this looks like being the third 
Christmas in a row where we will outperform.'

The brand put the sharp rise down to the cold weather as coats and gloves were among the items to fly off the shelves.

The department store is seen as 
something of a retail bellwether for the high street. And this weekend 
millions braved the cold to splurge £2billion in Britain's beleaguered 
shops.

Out in force...finally: Shoppers took to London's Oxford Street this weekend to snap up Christmas goods at slashed prices

Nearly a third of people will ignore the economic turbulence and take on debt to finance their Christmas plans, a report warned today.

A survey by YouGov on behalf of banking platform Intelligent Environments said 31 per cent of Britons will get through the festive period by taking out loans or by borrowing money from friends and family.

Among that group of people, 58 per cent will spend more than average on their credit cards, 39 per cent will be overdrawn, 11 p er cent will borrow from friends and/or family and 6 per cent would borrow money via a personal loan, with some people doing more than one of the above.

The research found that one in 10 Britons will lose control of their Christmas spending, even as another recession looms.

Nearly half of the nation is in debt, with those aged between 25 to 34 struggling most with money.

Jerry Mulle, a director at Intelligent Environments, said: 'Christmas is typically a cash-strapped time of the year but as harsher economic conditions start to bite, the number of people falling into debt or behind on their payments looks set to rise.'

On Oxford Street and in 
London's West End 2.2million shoppers shrugged off their financial woes 
to spend £280million - £50million more than an average weekend.

Perhaps they were enticed by a high street awash with bargains as many big-name brands slashed their stock by up to 70 per cent.

'Christmas has gone off with a bang this weekend,' reported Richard Dickinson, of traders' group the New West End Company to The Sun.

It was the same picture of shopping 
frenzy further north as Capital Shopping Centres (CSC), which runs 14 
malls including Manchester's Trafford Centre, reported that trade had 
been brisk over the weekend.

CSC's Peter Beagley told The Sun it had been a similar story in Glasgow's Braehead Centre.

'An army of shoppers were on the march,' he said.

Back down south, more than 250,000 shoppers descended on the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, up 15 per cent on this time last year.

Meanwhile shoppers in London racked up an average £180 each on computer games, toys and gadgets.

However, at shopping emporium Selfridges, customers were snapping up iPads, Kindles and chocolates.

Store director Meave Wall told The Sun: 'Customers are on a mission to buy.'

However, a spokesman for the British Retail Consortium warned the weekend's surge may not have very much influence on yearly sales figures overall.

'Sales have been very slow for October and November,' the spokesman said.

'Potentially that means people were saving for December in those months but will tighten their belts again in January.'

Queen of Shops Mary Portas is set to delivery her report into saving Britain's high streets tomorrow.
