West Brom defender Craig Dawson is set to escape any action over an elbow on Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni.

Palace boss Neil Warnock called the incident an ‘assault’ but referee Mark Clattenburg is understood to have seen the challenge and allowed West Brom’s first goal — headed in by Victor Anichebe — to stand.

Speroni required lengthy treatment before being taken off by Warnock, who said he wanted to protect the keeper from suffering any potential damage.

Victor Anichebe headed home with 51 minutes on the clock at the Hawthorns after Craig Dawson's (25) elbow

Warnock said: ‘It’s just like an assault. How come one of the four officials doesn’t see that? Dawson goes for about five yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face.’

Palace have conceded a league-high nine goals from set-pieces this season. 

Saido Berahino, 21, took his Premier League tally to seven with an added-time penalty to rescue a point for West Brom and head coach Alan Irvine believes the striker can become a real star. 

‘Saido wants to know what Rooney was like at that age. He has got a real chance of being a top player. We just have to keep him heading in the right direction.’ 

Neil Warnock was angry with the decision not to award Crystal Palace a free-kick
