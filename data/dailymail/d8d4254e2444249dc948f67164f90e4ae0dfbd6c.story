Sir Bradley Wiggins was denied a golden return to track cycling as he and England's pursuit team were beaten by a rampant Australia in the Commonwealth Games.

Wiggins, 34, joined Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Andy Tennant in claiming silver in the 4,000m discipline at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, but there was never any chance of edging out an Australia quartet who built an immediate advantage and never looked like letting it go.

‘I’m disappointed we came second here but in hindsight we’ll look back and think this is a start point for us now,’ he said. ‘Rio is the goal and we’ve got to work back from that.’

The team's valiant efforts were watched by Sophie, Countess of Wessex and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. The Countess roared on the team and covered her face when they failed to overcome the might of the Australian men's team.

Wiggins, 34, had not taken part in any 
significant international track meeting since the Beijing Olympics in 
2008, when he won two golds in China.

With a 
disappointing year at Team Sky behind him, having been dumped from the 
Tour de France - which he won in  2012, the first Briton to do - line-up, he made a late decision to compete here.

Instead
 Jack Bobridge, Alex Edmondson, Glenn O'Shea and Luke Davison finished 
with their English team in their sights and a winning margin in excess 
of five seconds - a crushing victory.

For Wiggins it represents a fourth 
Commonwealth Games silver medal after a six-year hiatus from the track, 
though there were signs that there is plenty more to come from both him 
and his team-mates on the road to Rio 2016.

Australia
 had finished almost two seconds ahead of England in qualifying, though 
the latter assured themselves of at least second place by besting a 
talented New Zealand outfit, who cruised to bronze by chasing down 
Canada.

A packed Glasgow 
audience showed no nationalistic bias as they roared Wiggins, Clancy, 
Burke and Tennant on but it was to no avail.

They slipped a second behind almost immediately as Australia attacked hard in the first couple of laps and the advantage was touching two seconds at the 1,500m mark.

England sensed hope when Davison dropped out of the race soon after halfway, but instead Australia merely increased their stranglehold, adding to their lead at each split.

Clancy rode himself to a standstill before pulling up late on, leaving Wiggins, Burke and Tennant to complete what had become a surprisingly one-sided outing.
