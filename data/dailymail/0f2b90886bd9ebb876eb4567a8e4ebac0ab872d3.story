Per Mertesacker was irritated after the victory over Algeria. His post-match rant at a TV reporter has since gone viral. At one point, the Arsenal defender told his victim: 'I don’t know what you want from me'.

The comment summed up Germany’s World Cup. Before this tournament, all the talk was of results, and results alone. It was all very well playing lovely, revolutionary football, people said, but where were the trophies? Where was the German efficiency of yesteryear?

Now, Low’s team have rediscovered that efficiency, people are asking where the beautiful football has gone. No wonder Mertesacker was confused when he asked: 'would you rather we played nicely and got knocked out?'

Germany have certainly failed to make viewers gasp in Brazil as they did in South Africa. Gone are the breathtaking counter attacks and the endless goals; replaced by a more possession based game which Low has honed over the last few years.

With the exception of Portugal, Germany are no longer destroying teams like they did four years ago. Over the last few weeks, there has been many a wistful newspaper column, longing for the 'Hurrah football' of 2010.

Many blame Low’s tactics, saying he is too obsessed with innovation, too rigid in his quest for modern football. There are other reasons though. In 2010, teams still believed they could outplay Germany. They were punished for that belief. Now, opponents defend. Germany are forced to scrap, to be ruthless and efficient. Spain suffered the same issue in 2010, winning many games 1-0, but ultimately claiming the title.

Nonetheless, the trend is to blame Low. Most say he has no Plan B, while also complaining that he is constantly coming up with new ideas. Whether he plays Philipp Lahm at right back or in midfield, he is criticised for it. If his team plays nice football, people want efficiency. If they play efficiently, people want nice football. He is stuck.

But if he wins the World Cup, all will be forgiven.

The trophy itself is all that matters this summer. Wolfgang Niersbach, head of the German FA, told the Tagesspiegel on Tuesday that Germany’s place in the FIFA rankings was proof enough of their success in recent years. He is the only one who believes that now.

Low has now had three shots at winning a major tournament, all of them unsuccessful. This is probably his last chance. At every round of this tournament, fans and media alike have been speculating that he might leave - an inconvenience he always used to be spared.

The German FA may declare their full faith in Low, but if Germany do fail this time, having played as they have, it will be fatal for his reputation. This time, he will have failed to win, and failed to entertain.

As for the next hurdle on the way to glory, Germany know that Brazil is the biggest challenge yet. They are not letting Neymar’s injury allow them to be complacent.

'We know we will come up against a strong Brazilian team. They are hard, they play differently these days,' warned Bastian Schweinsteiger this week.

They also know that they have more quality than Brazil, but it is not the players Germany fears. It is the manager. Just as the country has no faith in their own coach, they are fearful of his Brazilian counterpart. In the only other World Cup game between these two countries, the final of 2002, it was Scolari who led the Brazilians to victory. Schweinsteiger described him as "our biggest opponent" before Tuesday’s game.

Back home, the game is approached with more caution than expectation. Since 2006, both the German team and the German fans have seen the World Cup as a party. They have relaxed, done their own thing, and enjoyed the show.

This year, the joy has been dampened slightly. Where before, Germany games were greeted with excitement and euphoria, now they are greeted tentatively. For both the fans and the team, the freedom and the excitement is gone. It has been replaced only by grim determination to finally win the World Cup again.
