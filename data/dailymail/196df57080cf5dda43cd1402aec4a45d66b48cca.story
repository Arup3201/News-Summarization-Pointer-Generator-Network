The Grinch appears to be alive and well in one Californian neighborhood.

Residents living in a neighborhood in Orange County are trying to fight off mean-spirited local officials who have demanded they remove their Christmas lights.

Trabuco Canyon glistens in the darkness as the street is bound together by a colorful display of interlocking display of Christmas lights that have been hung from house to house.

Spirit of Christmas: California residents in an Orange County neighborhood say they've been ordered by local officials to take down an interlocking display of Christmas lights that hang from house to house

Community spirit: Around 15-20 homeowners have been told to remove their lights by this Wednesday or face the consequences

Vague: County officials have not explained exactly what 'codes' are being violated and it appears the lights are going to stay put - for now

But Orange County officials have reportedly ordered homeowners in Trabuco Canyon to remove the elaborate display.

Some 15-20 homeowners have received a letters from informing the residents that the lights which are anchored on multiple houses and suspended overhead, are an obstruction and a violation of the county code.

Jean Pasco from Orange County council explained to MailOnline that the concern was with the lights that had been strung up over the streets and not the individual displays on people's houses.

'The light that hang over the strret could be a hazard. Residents know that they're not supposed to hang lights over a public road. At some point they are dangling dangerously low.'

Essentially, officials are worried that the lights are strung up in a flimsy manner and that a storm could potentially bring them down and electrocute someone.

The intricate display of lights has been a tradition in the neighborhood for at least five years, residents said.

'We’re in violation of a county ordinance that we’re not quite sure of,' said Brian Kopiec to KTLA, who lives in Wagon Wheel.

'When we bought the house, the people that sold it to us told us what a great neighborhood it was, and they actually warned us that this neighborhood goes great at Christmas,' he said.

Mr Kopiec says he is unsure if he will take the order to remove the lights seriously.

'I think it’s actually horrible, what they’re doing to us. All the poor kids — they love the lighting display, and it really brings the neighborhood together.'

The Christmas crackdown has some saying that Orange County is playing the Grinch to an ongoing ‘War on Christmas.’

Others say the neighbors went several light strings too far in decorating for the holidays.
