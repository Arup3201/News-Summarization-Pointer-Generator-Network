With gamers admitting they’d give up Christmas dinner to avoid having to stop playing, one store has invented an entire festive feast in a tin.

Dubbed 'Christmas Tinner', the nausea-inducing concoction comprises of nine layers of food - ranging from a starter to a pudding.

The top layer is made of scrambled egg and bacon and this sits above a layer of fruity mincemeat.

The middle layers combine turkey and potatoes, roast carrots and other trimmings before being finished off by a layer of Christmas pudding.

It has been created by retailer GAME, with designer Chris Godfrey and costs £1.99.

The launch comes after the gaming retailer found almost half (43 per cent) of gamers in the UK intend to spend the majority of the holidays on their consoles.

It also said the tin saves on the washing up and there is even a ‘Without Sprouts’ version that uses broccoli instead.

The full nine layers, from top to bottom, include scrambled egg and bacon, two mince pies, turkey and potatoes, gravy, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, Brussels sprouts with stuffing - or broccoli with stuffing - roast carrots and parsnips and Christmas pudding,

All the food is sealed in gelatine before being added to the tin one at a time.

The Christmas Tinner has been trialled in the Basingstoke store, and the firm said it plans to sell it in stores across the country if there is enough demand.

Research from Domino’s Pizza recently found that gamers will do anything in order to carrying on playing.

Almost half of male gamers admitted they have turned down sex to continue playing, while a fifth of female gamers said they’d missed weddings and hen dos.

As a hot alternative to the Christmas 
Tinner, Firebox is selling the Christmas Dinner HotCan that contains a 
turkey casserole with vegetables, chipolatas, stuffing balls and 
cranberry jelly.

Users simply pierce the can, which kickstarts an exothermic reaction to warm the meal to around 60 degrees celsius.

The 400g tin takes 12 minutes to cook.

More disgustingly, one in seven gamers confessed to relieving themselves in an empty drinks bottle to avoid having to leave the room - with gamers in Birmingham among the worst offenders.

As a hot alternative to the Christmas Tinner, Firebox is selling the Christmas Dinner HotCan that contains a turkey casserole with vegetables, chipolatas, stuffing balls and cranberry jelly.

HotCans consist of a can of food surrounded by an outer shell, with a water sachet and processed granular limestone in between.

Customers pierce the rim of the can and this sachet, which causes the water to flow into the limestone.

This triggers a natural heat-producing reaction which warms up the food to between 60 and 70 degrees celsius.

The 400g tin then takes 12 minutes to cook and the chemical reaction means user don't even need a cooker or microwave.
