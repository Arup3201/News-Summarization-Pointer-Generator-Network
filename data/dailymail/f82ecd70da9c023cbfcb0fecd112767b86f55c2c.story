They are the brands that Britain grew up with but 53 of the top 100 are losing sales – many despite slashing prices.

Famous names like Silver Spoon sugar, Cadbury, Whiskas, Heinz and Kingsmill are suffering sales falls of more than 10per cent as shoppers switch to budget chains.

The nation’s fastest growing stores, Aldi and Lidl, effectively ban many of the top brands from their shelves.

At the same time, the big four stores – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have cut the shelf space given to brands, while pushing their own label alternatives.

Changes in eating habits, concerns about sugar consumption and a decision to cut back on carbs, particularly bread are also playing a part.

The supermarkets have also been very clever at launching copycat products which ape the household names but have a lower price.

The figures were compiled by retail analysts Nielsen and The Grocer magazine which said the proportion of the 100 brands that are losing sales rose from 26 in 2013 to 34 in 2014 and it is now 53.

As a result, the total annual sales of the top 100 is down by some £146.4m to £20.5billion.

Silver Spoon, the British granulated sugar brand is by far the biggest casualty of the backlash against sugar and its links to obesity.

The Grocer said: ‘A year ago, it was Britain’s 68th biggest grocery brand, but it has fallen out of the rankings with a staggering loss of £62.6m in sales – 47.1per cent – thanks partly to the sugar debate.’

It added: ‘The opprobrium surrounding the sugar levels in many grocery products has hit some players hard.’

The Cadbury brand – apart from Dairy Milk – has also suffered with sales down by 15.2per cent - £34.8m – in a year.

The giant has come under fire since a take-over by American food giant Kraft with concerns the new owners have failed to honour its British heritage.

It reneged on a promise to keep open a British factory, while consumers have complained about products being shrunk or changes to the chocolate used in products, such as the coating to its famous crème egg.

In the same category, Mars is down by 10.5per cent, while Kitkat has fallen some 7.6per cent. Just last week, the Mail revealed how its Kitkat chunky is less chunky after being cut from 48g to 40g without a corresponding fall in the price.

The manufacturer, Nestle, claimed this was partly because of rising costs and partly because of a desire to help customers lose weight, which did not go down well.

Innocent smoothies have been caught up in the backlash against sugary drinks with sales down 10.8per cent in a year.

The Grocer said: ‘In the anti-sugar witch hunt Innocent is guilty as charged, say health lobbyists. And their increasingly alarmist proclamations have hit sales hard.’

Kingsmill has suffered badly from the nation’s efforts to cut back on carbs, particularly white sliced bread, with sales down by 11.6per cent.

The Grocer said: ‘Kingsmill has fallen victim to a double whammy of declining volume sales in the sliced bread market and a bread price war that has driven a 5.6per cent decline in the average price.’

Such is the decline that Tesco has decided to take the brand’s loaves off its shelves.

Other big bread brands have also in decline, including Warburtons, which is down 4.1per cent, and Hovis by 4.8per cent.

Heinz has been part of kitchen life for more than 100 years, however the study found both its soups and baked beans are less popular.

Sales of Heinz soups are down by 10.2per cent in a year, hit hard by the fact Britain enjoyed a relatively mild winter, while the number of cans of beans going through tills fell 3.5per cent.

There are suggestions that shoppers may be looking for something a bit more upmarket and exotic. As a result, Heinz has responded by launching Fajita pinto and Tuscan cannellini to its ‘Five Beanz’ range.

Other famous names to lose more than 10per cent in sales in just one year include WeightWatchers, which is down 21.6per cent, Tetley tea, Tate & Lyle, Flora, Whiskas cat food, Special K, Rowntrees, Princes and Activia.

The Grocer said: ‘Britain’s biggest grocery brands are playing a dangerous game. With the discounters advancing and prices being cut across the board, many are starting to look like pawns in the battle between grocery’s grandmasters.

‘Deflation reigns. The average price of 42 of the 100 biggest brands has fallen in the past year.’

Some brands, such as Coca-Cola, are trying to woo Aldi and Lidl in order to cash in on their growth. Others are targeting the pound stores by launching products that are shrunk or changed to meet the £1 price point.
