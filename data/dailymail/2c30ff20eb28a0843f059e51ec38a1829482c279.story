A price glitch in round-trip tickets between New York and
Israel sparked an online buying frenzy among Orthodox Jews on Monday who saw tickets ordinarily
priced around $1,600 slashed below $400.

At least 5,000 tickets were sold in just three hours by El Al Airlines after word of their dramatically reduced airfare spread through New York's traditionally large-family Orthodox Jewish communities.

'I booked me, my wife, her parents and her three brothers,'
Joey Mansour, 28, told the New York Post.

Error: A ticket glitch in EL-AL's airfare mistakenly dropped round-trip tickets to Israel from $1,600 to below $400 on Monday

Frenzy: Word of the dramatically low prices spread through New York's traditionally large-family Orthodox Jewish communities causing the frenzy

'Then I booked my in-laws again for March, my wife’s first
cousin who’s married with three children, his mother-in-law, my wife’s aunt,
her husband, and two kids.'

Pregnant women were reported to have bought seats for their
unborn children as well.

'The whole office went into chaos mode,' Lazar Cohen who
broadcast the fares to his co-workers told the Post.

'...five of the eight people in the office immediately
booked tickets for themselves and their families, without hesitation,' he said.

Sweep: Large Jewish families eagerly swept up the tickets to Tel Aviv on Monday with at least 5,000 tickets sold before the error was caught

After noticing the unusual spike in ticket sales, El Al caught the mistake.

The airline blames the glitch on a contractor responsible for
posting fares. After some review on Wednesday they announced that they will honour the price.

'An outside company posted incorrect fares on travel
websites, so all tickets sold will indeed be honored,' the airline stated.

An El Al special flight special on travel
between New York and Tel Aviv is today offered at $1,179.
