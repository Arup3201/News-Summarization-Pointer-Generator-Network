It's hard to imagine a young Roy Keane dancing to Culture Club but the former Manchester United captain reveals in his new book that Karma Chameleon was the first single he bought.

Keane, who outlined his disgust at Abba's Dancing Queen blaring out of the Sunderland dressing room during his time as manager, was quizzed by Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman about his tune of choice.

And at the Dublin press conference to officially launch the Irishman's updated autobiography, The Second Half, the exchange that followed was more Keane (red) gold (and green).

Keane was finally asked about the new bearded look he has cultivated this season and gave a disarming response.

‘I am just being a little bit lazy,’ he said. ‘But if you want me to get rid of it, I might.’

Ladyman: Your first single was Karma Chameleon?

Keane (pointing) : I was 12….

Ladyman: Yeh but still…

Keane: I was 12…..

Ladyman: I wouldn’t have admitted it…

Keane: Ok, what was yours?

Ladyman: It was an Abba record

Keane: Why doesn’t that surprise me? 

1980s pop group Culture Club would not have been everyone's guess as Keane's first single
