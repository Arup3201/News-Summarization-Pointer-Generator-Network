A reality TV show starring model Reeva Steenkamp will be aired today just two days after she was allegedly shot dead by her boyfriend, athletic superstar Oscar Pistorius.

The law graduate died in the early hours of Valentine's Day at the home of the double amputee, who has been charged with her murder.

South African Miss Steenkamp, 29, was shot four times in the head, waist, arm and hand by the 26-year-old, a court heard yesterday.

Her violent death has devastated her family and friends, and stunned the rest of the world.

But now a TV show that she made an appearance on has, after a 'struggle', decided to air the episode.

In The Tropika Island of Treasure, Ms Steenkamp competes alongside seven South African celebrities and seven other contestants to win a prize of one million rand prize (£72,500).

Today the SABC station showed footage of the model in which she says : 'Not just your journey in life but the way that you go out and make your exit is so important.

'You have either made an impact in a positive way or a negative way.'

The programme's website issued a message saying: 'We are deeply saddened and extend our condolences to Reeva's family and friends.'

Executive producer Samantha Moon told the BBC: 'As we grieve today with Reeva's family and friends and struggle to make sense of this shocking tragedy, it has taken much deliberation to come to the decision to continue screening Tropika Island of Treasure 5 as planned.'

The show, set in Jamaica, asks contestants to describe themselves in three words and Miss Steenkamp said: 'Brainy, blonde, bombshell'.

A tribute will be aired ahead of the reality show, on SABC1 at 6.30pm local time (16.30 GMT).

In the tribute, Miss Steenkamp says that she has 'fallen in love with Jamaica' and that there is 'one love, everywhere'.

She can be seen swimming with dolphins and says that she has 'amazing memories that I'll treasure forever' of her time on the show.

The model can be seen in an interview
to her fellow contestants that it's important to 'maintain dignity, 
maintain class and always be true to yourself.'

Miss
Steenkamp had taken to her Twitter account to excitedly write about her
part in the show, asking followers to help her decide what to wear for 
her publicity events.

On the
website, it describes how Reeva was born in Cape Town and moved to Port
Elizabeth as a child where she continued her studies after 
matriculating, eventually graduating with a degree in law.

It
says: 'She moved to Johannesburg 6 years ago after being scouted and 
named the first face of cosmetics giant Avon South Africa.

'Since then, Reeva has travelled between JHB and Cape Town to film and shoot some of SA’s leading campaigns and commercials.

'Toyota, FHM, Clover and Italian brand Zui are some of the more prestigious clients she has worked for.

In the show, Reeva said she had a passion for cooking and loves spending quality time with her friends and family

On the show which will be broadcast today, Reeva said she liked reading books on her days off

'With
a background in TV presenting, once the live roaming presenter for 
FashionTV in South Africa, Reeva is currently working on some major 
projects that include smaller TV roles as well as a lead in a new 
reality TV show.

'Reeva has a passion for cars and 
cooking and prefers to read a book on her off days and spend quality 
time with friends and family.'

The series of this show is based in Jamaica, and sees contestants battle with each other to stay on the island.

They have to complete a series of challenges, including  diving off 75-foot cliffs into the ocean, tug of wars, and races.

Miss Steenkamp had reportedly been hoping to branch out of modelling and begin starring in some television roles.

On
her Twitter biography, Miss Steenkamp described herself as a 'Model, 
Cover Girl, Tropika Island Of Treasure Celeb Contestant, Law Graduate, 
Child of God'.

Miss Steenkamp's publicist Sarit 
Tomlinson paid tribute to her, saying she was 'the sweetest human being 
and an absolute angel on earth'.

Miss Steenkamp had been due to deliver an inspirational speech about abusive relationships to schoolchildren

She added: 'She was the kindest, most unbelievable girl.'

The popular woman had planned to 
deliver an inspirational and touching speech to schoolchildren just 
hours after she was gunned down at the Paralympian's home.

She
was expected to tell pupils that she had previously been in an abusive 
relationship which had led to a 'loss of self worth', prompting her to 
move to Johannesburg to rebuild her life.

Miss Steenkamp was due to warn the secondary school pupils in Johannesburg: 'No matter how many people say that they "love" you, if you do not love your person then you will never step outside of the physical you.

'The physical you can only do so much if your mental you is lost inside of all the confusion.'

Her speech said that it 'took some serious soul searching to remind myself of my value in this world.'

Miss Steenkamp and Pistorius had only been going out since November.

She
tweeted the day before Valentine's Day: 'What do you have up your 
sleeve for your love tomorrow??? #getexcited #'ValentinesDay.'

Pistorius appeared to have serious concerns about his safety and was said to sleep with a revolver by his side.

It
was reported that she was hit by bullets fired through the door of a 
bathroom at the luxury complex on the outskirts of Pretoria where 
Pistorius, a keen marksman, kept a pistol and machine gun.

A 9mm pistol was recovered by police investigating the scene.

Police spokeswoman Lt Col Katlego Mogale said: 'Paramedics declared the woman dead on the scene and police proceeded with their investigation.

'The woman sustained wounds to her head and the upper body.'

Pistorius is being held at Brooklyn Police Station prison in Pretoria and strongly denies the charge.

Oscar Pistorius, who shot Reeva Steenkamp dead at his home in South Africa, had been dating since November

Prosecutors are expected to argue that the killing was pre-meditated murder, which carries a life sentence.

Lawyers for Pistorius are said to be preparing to argue the shooting was a tragic accident.

If found guilty of premeditated murder Pistorius would not be eligible to be considered for parole until he is aged 51.

Pistorius had been expected to apply for bail, but this has been postponed until Tuesday after the defence and prosecution agreed to allow more time for this to be heard. 

He will be held in custody at Brooklyn Prison in Pretoria, next door to the firearms registration centre, until then.

The athlete made history at the London 2012 Olympics becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete in the able-bodied Games, running in the 400m and 4x400m relay.

The star was born without fibulas and underwent below-the-knee amputations at just 11 months old.
