'Multi-organ failure': The condition of Ariel Sharon is deteriorating, doctors admit

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in a coma since a 2006 stroke, is clinging to life after his condition took a turn for the worse last week, the head of the hospital treating him said on Sunday.

Sharon was fighting like a 'true lion,' Zeev Rotstein told reporters.

But he added: 'Our general assessment is there is no way to overcome this crisis...I am perhaps more pessimistic than I was before.'

The 85-year-old’s condition sharply deteriorated last week, with doctors reporting a life-threatening collapse of vital organs.

Rotstein said Sharon’s two sons remained at his bedside in the Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv.

One of Israel’s most famous generals, Sharon left his mark on the region through military invasion, Jewish settlement building on captured land and a shock, unilateral decision to pull Israeli troops and settlers out of the Gaza Strip in 2005.

Sharon was one of Israel's most iconic and controversial figures and his career stretched across Israel's 65-year history.

Speaking to reporters yesterday at the hospital, Rotstein said Sharon's life remains in danger and that 'there is a slow and gradual deterioration' in his condition along with 'multi-organ failure'.

Test results show Sharon also has a blood infection, Rotstein said.

The director refused to provide a prognosis but when asked if Sharon will recover, 'looking at the trend of deterioration, it doesn't give us good signs for the future'.

Sharon's family was by his bedside, Rotstein said.

Referring to Sharon by his nickname 'Arik,' Rotstein said Sharon 'is fighting like a real fighter, as he did all his life.'

As one of Israel's most famous generals, Sharon was known for bold tactics and an occasional refusal to obey orders.

Sharon is credited with helping turn 
the tide of the 1973 Mideast war when Arab armies launched a surprise 
attack on Israel on the solemn fasting day of Yom Kippur, causing large 
Israeli casualties.

He led an Israeli force across the Suez Canal, trapping part of the Egyptian army and turning the war in Israel's favor.

As
 a politician, he became known as 'the bulldozer' - a man contemptuous 
of his critics while also capable of getting things done. He was elected
 prime minister in 2001.

In
 mid-2005, he directed a unilateral withdrawal of Israeli troops and 
settlers from the Gaza Strip, ending a 38-year military control of the 
territory.

It was a shocking turnaround for a man who had been a leading player in building Jewish settlements in captured territories.

He
 later bolted from his hard-line Likud Party and established the 
centrist Kadima Party.

It seemed he was on his way to an easy 
re-election when he suffered the stroke in January 2006.

After
 spending months in the Jerusalem hospital where he was initially 
treated, Sharon was transferred to the long-term care facility at Tel 
Hashomer hospital.

He was taken home briefly at one point but was returned several days later to the hospital, where he has been since.
