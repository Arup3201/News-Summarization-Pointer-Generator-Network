An 11-year-old girl from Arkansas gave her family the scare of their lives last week when she ran away from home after stealing $10,000 and jumped into a cab hoping to travel to Florida to meet a boy.

When Brent Waller discovered that his daughter Alexis was gone December 5, his first, terrifying thought was that she had been abducted.

But the father soon learned that the 11-year-old was not the victim of a kidnapping, but rather the culprit.

Runaway: Alexis Waller, 11, pictured left and right, gave her father the scare of his life December 5 when she ran away from their Bryant, Arkansas, home and headed to Florida alone to meet a boy 

Contrite: Sitting on the couch next to her dad, Brent Waller, a crestfallen Alexis said she was glad her parents tracked her down and brought her home  

On the move: Alexis started her journey in her hometown of Bryan, Arkansas, planning to travel more than 850-mile down to Jacksonville, Florida, but was detaind in Atlanta, Georiga, about 350 miles shy of her goal

The 11-year-old girl had swiped $10,000 in cash from her grandmother's sock drawer, crept out of the family’s Bryant, Arkansas, home in the middle of the night and hitched a ride with a stranger to a gas station in Little Rock.

Alexis then called a cab and asked the driver to drive her to Jacksonville, Florida, located about 830 miles away.

The girl said the taxi driver did not ask her any questions beyond her final destination and whether or not she had the $1,300 fare.

Alexis said she decided to make the long journey halfway across the country because she wanted to see a 16-year-old boy she had met on vacation two years prior and had been talking to ever since.

The Florida teen later said he knew nothing about Alexis’ escape plan.

When Alexis' parents discovered that she was gone and called police to report her missing, investigators jumped into action trying to find her.

Road trip: The pre-teen swiped $10,000 from her grandmother's sock drawer, hitchhiked to a gas station in Little Rock where she hailed a cab, paying the driver $1,300 to take her to faraway Jacksonville, Florida

Reunited: Police were able to track Alexis down to a suburb outside Atlanta, Georgia, where her father, Brent Waller (pictured), picked her up after driving for nine hours through the night

Police obtained phone records and were able to trace Alexis' call to the Little Rock cab company, where officials said the girl wore heavy makeup and appeared to be 17 or 18, according to Arkansas Democrat Gazette. 

Before long, they reached the taxi driver the girl had hired, who told them they were driving in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.

The 11-year-old's parents immediately hit the road, driving nine hours to pick her up.

In retrospect, Alexis Waller said she was glad her parents were able to track her down and bring her home safe.

‘I knew I made a mistake after a while and I didn't have a phone,’ Alexis told KARK-TV.

Brent Waller said when he reunited with his daughter in Georgia, he was furious at her but also relieved that she was unharmed.

Crime and punishment: Mr Waller took away Alexis' makeup after learning that the young girl used it on the night of her escape to make herself look older 

The taxi driver who agreed to take the pre-teen to Florida will not face any disciplinary actions, according to his employers.

The Waller family now plan to push for legislation that would require cabbies to ask their passengers, especially minors, for identification.

As for Alexis, Waller said he has confiscated her cell phone and makeup. Her grandmother isn't pressing charges over the stolen cash.
