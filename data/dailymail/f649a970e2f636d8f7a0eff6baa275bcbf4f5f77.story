A strain of bird flu which has killed 36 people in China can mutate to become resistant to antiviral drugs, say Chinese researchers.

Shanghai doctors treating 14 sufferers of the H7N9 virus found that it had become resistant to Tamiflu in three of the patients.

Researchers at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre said that while the drug reduced levels of the virus in 11 of the patients, genetic testing of bird flu in the three who did not respond to treatment showed it was able to effectively mutate to resist Tamiflu.

They even believe that resistance in at least one of the patients was a direct result of the presence of Tamiflu.

Such drugs, known as neuraminidase inhibitors, are the only known way to treat H7N9.

Scientists say that they are concerned by the results of their investigation even though flu viruses have been known to mutate.

The researchers said in The Lancet: 'The apparent ease with which antiviral resistance emerges in H7N9 viruses is concerning, it needs to be closely monitored and considered in future pandemic response plans.'

All 14 of the patients tested had pneumonia and were placed on ventilation to keep them from dying.

The team found traces of H7N9 in patients' urine, blood and stools indicating that the virus is not just spread through respiratory secretions as previously thought.

Drugs such as Tamiflu do not cure the virus but can make the illness less severe and make recovery quicker.

Overall, there have been 131 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since the first cases of the virus emerged earlier this year.

There have been no new cases of the infection since May 8.

United Nations experts claimed last week that the outbreak of the latest strain of bird flu has hit the Chinese economy to the tune of $6.5billion, according to NBCNews.com.

Pictures emerged earlier this month of chicken farmers resorting to killing off newborn chicks by plunging them in boiling water as they faced official demands to dispose of as many birds as possible.

The Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) had said it had no evidence that the new strain of bird flu, which was first detected in patients in China in March, is easily transmissible between humans.

Chinese scientists confirmed at the beginning of May that the H7N9 strain has been transmitted to humans from chickens.

But the WHO has said around 40 per cent of people infected with H7N9 appear to have had no contact with poultry.
