Ed Miliband was today accused of ‘total hypocrisy’ after running up a £135,000 bill for a taxpayer-funded chauffeur driven limo while sanctioning attacks on cars used by government ministers.

The Labour leader faced calls to use public transport or invest in a bicycle instead of being driven around London in car paid for by the state.

It comes after Labour blasted transport minister Simon Burns for being driven home instead of using the train, accusing him of being ‘out of touch’ and telling ministers to ‘get out of their limos’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has clocked up a £135,000 bill for his official car funded by the taxpayer, despite his party accusing ministers of being 'out of touch; for not using public transport

Tory MPs said Mr Miliband should practice what he preaches and stop being picked up from his 'multi-million pound house in Primrose Hill in a taxpayer-funded car'.

Instead he should buy a 'bicycle and a hat with a bobble on top' to get around town.

Official figures released in Parliament show Mr Miliband’s official car – provided to the Leader of the Opposition – has cost taxpayers £135,270.50 since the beginning of September 2010.

From September 2010 until March 31 2011, the vehicle cost the Cabinet Office £33,592.71. In the year from April 2011, the car cost £56,645.05 and from April 2012 until December 31 2012, the Cabinet Office spent £45,032.74.

The revelation is especially embarrassing for Mr Miliband after Labour attacked the government for its use of official cars.

It emerged that transport minister Mr Burns was using an £80,000-a-year pool car to be driven from his home in Chelmsford, where he is MP, to Westminster every day.

He claimed he was able to work in the car but after a furious public backlash in the week when rail fares rocketed, he decided to let the train take the strain.

He was pictured waiting on the platform for the 5.58am, and was forced to stand in the corridor for the 36 minute journey from Chelmsford to Liverpool Street, London.

But Maria Eagle, Labour’s shadow transport secretary, used Mr Burns's car travel to score political points.

‘No wonder ministers are so out of touch with the eye-watering cost of rail fares when they are spending tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money being driven around all day,’ she said.

‘They should get out of their limos and speak to those hard-pressed commuters who have this week seen the cost of their season ticket rocket by hundreds of pounds.’

Today Tory MPs seized on the remarks to say Mr Miliband should follow his frontbench colleague’s advice and ‘get out of his limo’ too.

Transport minister Simon Burns was criticised for being driven home to Chelmsford in a government car, so he let the train take the strain last week, and was pictured looking cold on the platform and then forced to stand

The figures for Mr Miliband’s car use were released in a parliamentary question tabled by Tory MP Chris Skidmore.

Mr Skidmore told MailOnline: Ed Miliband isn't even in government yet he is still using taxpayer's money to traipse across the country preaching the politics of One Nation, when it is hardly One Nation to be picked up from outside your multi-million pound house in Primrose Hill in a taxpayer-funded car.

'He needs to have a long hard look at himself. At a time when hardworking people are struggling to pay the costs of transport it is unacceptable for Ed Miliband to be not practicing what he preaches.

'I am sure Maria Eagle will want to be consistent in her approach and will be having a long, hard chat with her leader to ensure that there is no hypicrasy going on.'

Ian Liddell-Grainger said Mr Miliband should find alternative ways to get around to prove he is in touch with the public mood: ‘He would look fantastic in an anorak on the train. It would be the geek exactly where he should be.

‘He needs to cut his bill down, get a bicycle, an anorak and a hat with a bobble on the top.

‘There is complete hypocrisy here. It is just ridiculous. Every minister is trying to do what they can to go on public transport and reduce costs.

‘But where we have got a Labour frontbencher attacking a junior minister when her own leader is just flaunting it as well is just ridiculous. I think Maria Eagle should hang her head in shame.’

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'Everyone in power owes it to taxpayers to look for ways in which they themselves can save money.

'Any politician with access to a chauffeur-driven car must be looking to reduce the burden they are placing on the taxpayer for using that facility.'

Transport minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘The Government Car Service provides an allocated car for the Leader of the Official Opposition. This is consistent with the practice for the previous Leader of the Official Opposition.’

A Labour Party Spokesperson said: 'When the Conservative Party was in opposition David Cameron was allocated and regularly used a Government car. David Cameron’s own transport minister has admitted Ed Miliband’s use of a car is entirely consistent with that practice.

'Ed Miliband regularly uses public transport and attends many official functions and meetings in his role of the Leader of the Opposition.'
