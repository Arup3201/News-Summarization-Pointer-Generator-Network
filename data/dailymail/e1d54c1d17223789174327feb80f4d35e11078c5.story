David Cameron kicked off the Tory Election campaign yesterday with an intensely personal attack on Ed Miliband and his ‘hopeless, sneering socialists’.

The Prime Minister made a direct assault on the Labour leader’s background, calling it the ‘same old condescending, bossy, interfering, we-know-best attitude of the Hampstead socialist down the ages’.

Mr Cameron’s withering reference to the North London borough associated with ‘champagne socialists’ comes after Mr Miliband was ridiculed last year for claiming in his party conference speech to have met ordinary voters on Hampstead Heath, a short walk from his £2.6million home.

Attack: Mr Cameron said it was ‘same old condescending, bossy, interfering, we-know-best attitude of the Hampstead socialist down the ages’

With just 40 days until the tightest Election for a generation, Mr Cameron used his first address of the campaign to unveil the party’s slogan – ‘We are with you’. 

He told supporters at his party’s spring forum in Manchester that the Conservatives were ‘the real party of aspiration, of working people – the party that is with you, not against you is not that bunch of hypocritical, holier-than-thou, hopeless, sneering socialists’.

He defended his approach, declaring: ‘Some might say, “Don’t make this personal,” but when it comes to who’s Prime Minister, the personal is national.’ 

Withering: Prime Minister claimed 'I know what this role needs – and I don’t think Ed Miliband has it'

He added: ‘I know what this role needs – and frankly, I don’t think Ed Miliband has it’, warning voters Mr Miliband would ‘be the one taking the make-or-break calls in the middle of the night’.

Speaking at the ITV studios where Coronation Street was filmed, Mr Cameron also compared Mr Miliband unfavourably to his predecessors, saying Labour was ‘not the party of Clement Attlee, who built the NHS... not the party of Wilson and his ‘white heat of technology’... not even the party of John Smith, who believed so passionately in the dignity of work.’ 

Instead, he said, they ‘were the party whose new Jerusalem is a load of dead-end lives and poverty handed down through the generations’.

Chancellor George Osborne also mocked Mr Miliband, who, when asked last week by Jeremy Paxman whether he was tough enough to be PM, replied, ‘Hell, yes.’ 

Osborne painted a picture of life under a Labour Government, describing it as: ‘Hell – yes, indeed.’

Mr Cameron also used the speech to promise that a future Tory Government would turn the NHS into a true seven-day service, with more hospitals providing top-level treatment at the weekend.
