An Arkansas woman who was fed up with her husband's incessant snoring has been charged with attempted first degree murder after repeatedly stabbing him in his sleep with a butcher's knife.

Dawn Weiser, of Springdale, plead not guilty in court on Wednesday after leaving her husband with a punctured spleen, lacerated liver and three other stab wounds from the attack.Â 

The 44-year-old mother of two was sleeping in a spare room with her son after an argument earlier in the evening with her husband Doug about his snoring.

She is alleged to have crept back into the bedroom in the early hours of the morning and began stabbing her husband with a butcher's knife.

Her 43-year-old husband was able to wrestle the knife from her and call police, after being stabbed several times.

Mrs Weiser told police she awoke to a loud noise during the night and walked in to find her husband with stab wounds.

She went on to insist that an intruder was responsible for the stabbing, despite her husband saying she was responsible for his wounds.

Investigators say Dawn later confessed to stabbing her husband and hiding the knife and told police she couldn't stand being kept awake any longer.

Dawn was so angry at her husband's snoring that she had spoken about it on social media.

A week before the alleged attack she wrote on her Twitter account: 'A certain someone is about to have an appointment made to address SNORING. #notnamingnames.'

Details of the attack, which took place on August 29th, came out as Mrs Wesier made her first court appearance on Wednesday on an attempted first degree murder charge.

She pleaded not guilty and has been sent for trial in December.

The court was told her husband filed for divorce a week after the alleged attack.
