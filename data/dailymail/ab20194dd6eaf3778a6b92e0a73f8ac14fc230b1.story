A horse, a dog, a flock of seagulls and a box of eggs. Not the start of a bad joke, but some of the highlights – and surprises – of campaigning to maintain Scotland within the United Kingdom.

I always knew the independence referendum would be the most important event I would ever be involved in, the most important event for Scotland. Because of that I decided to campaign in a totally different way, going back to an old-fashioned politics predating social media and spin doctors. I embarked on a 100-stop tour of open-air meetings across my beautiful country.

It was just me, my microphone, my makeshift stage of two Irn-Bru crates and whoever turned up. Thousands of Scots came along and joined the great debate.

And I loved most of it. I visited places I’d never been to before and discovered that the best comedians aren’t only found at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Many were in the crowds with a wry comment or a well-timed put-down. I’m not sure I got the better of every exchange.

From Barra to Barrhead, it wasn’t just undecided voters that got involved. On the island of Islay I was heckled by a horse wearing a Yes Scotland blanket. In Ayr I was barked at by a dog with ‘Freedom’ scrawled across its back. His purple-bearded owner claimed to be called William Wallace, and spent most of the meeting trying to climb on my crates bellowing ‘Traitor!’ in my right ear.

One meeting in Oban harbour was disrupted by uninvited visitors. When I arrived the crowd had their hoods up. Surprisingly, some even had umbrellas above their heads on a lovely rain-free evening. A journalist had to explain that the Yes voter at the edge of the crowd was the ‘Oban Seagull Whisperer’, who had summoned dozens of gulls over us to disrupt our gathering with droppings, but we just kept going!

There was a lighthearted edge to many of the criticisms – hecklers helped make many of the meetings more authentic.

However sometimes it became far more sinister. There is a dark corner of Scotland where an intolerant Scottish nationalism lives. We all know that no political movement is without its idiots. But what went on at times in the referendum was of a different nature altogether – it wasn’t the occasional fool but an orchestrated campaign.

In places like Motherwell, Dundee and Kirkcaldy, Yes groups organised big crowds of their followers to drown out our events, preventing undecided voters from joining open-air democracy. In their dozens and sometimes in their hundreds they screamed ‘Traitor!’, ‘Scum!’, ‘Quisling!’ and even ‘Terrorist’.

And there was one more vile insult they hurled at me. In the midst of the campaign, new details appeared in the media about alleged 1970s child abuse in and around Westminster. To some of my opponents, it didn’t matter that I was in primary school when these terrible cases were alleged to have taken place. Instead it became a regular insult to scream ‘Paedophile!’ at me throughout my street meetings.

An anti-English group, Siol nan Gaidheal – or ‘Seed of the Gaels’ – boasted that they had been ‘following Murphy’ for ‘in-your-face confrontations’. And there was a lot of publicity for the least-skilled egg thrower – it took him four eggs before he hit me. But I couldn’t care less about an egg thrower, what was worrying was their determination to deny us space in Scotland’s streets.

And it wasn’t just me; Ed Miliband and others were also in their sights, and the BBC’s Glasgow HQ was targeted by Yes protesters because of unfounded allegations of anti-independence bias at the BBC.

I know the vast majority of Yes supporters would never dream of behaving like this. They decided to support the Yes campaign because they believed it was best for their family and our country. They are decent and honest people, many of whom are hurting this weekend.

But wherever we went there was often a noisy crowd that followed us. Rightly, nothing like this ever happened to Alex Salmond or the Yes campaign.

After a while my meetings became impossible places to guarantee public safety – I had to halt my tour and seek police advice. To this day, I still don’t know how high up in the Yes campaign these actions were sanctioned, but I do know how widespread they became.

I lost count of how many No voters told me they were too worried to wear a sticker or display a poster. The effect was that visually, the Yes campaign appeared to speak for the majority. If the vote was decided by which campaign had the most window posters, then Scotland would be independent.

Fortunately windows don’t vote. But this phenomenon of passionate political silence gave me confidence that there was an undeclared pride in many people at being both Scottish and British. And Alistair Darling among others continually emphasised that referendum day was the time for ‘the quiet patriotic majority to stand up and be counted’.

‘Better Together’ was our campaign motto. But it has to be more than just a slogan. It’s time to put the divisions of the campaign behind us and concentrate on what we have in common. In a dangerous and complicated world, the combined power, prosperity and influence of the four nations in our imperfect Union is something to be cherished.
