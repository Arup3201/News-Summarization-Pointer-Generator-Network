A British salesman is set to become one of the world's richest men after selling his contact lens business for £700 million.

Alan Wells set up an opticians in Twickenham, south west London, in 1985 when he noticed contact lenses becoming something of a trend.

Within 10 years, Sauflon Pharmaceuticals was thriving, with factories in London, Kent and Hungary.

Now, despite keeping a low profile for 29 years, Mr Wells has become an icon of British business, sealing a deal with U.S. firm Cooper Vision for $1.2 billion.

Thriving: Alan Wells set up an opticians in 
Twickenham, south west London, in 1985 when he noticed contact lenses 
becoming something of a trend and now his firm has become Sauflon Pharmaceuticals

Adding an estimated £280 million to his 
fortune, the father-of-three will now be one of the world's richest men -
 possibly ranking above the £210 million Beckham family in the Sunday 
Times Rich List.

Describing his ascent in 2010, he told Contact Lens Monthly: 'Throughout my career my motivation has been fear of failure.

'With our products we have the tiger by the tail. I honestly believe we have the best contact lens in the world.'

The firm was set up just 10 years after disposable lenses were invented by British optometrist Dr Rishi Agarwal.

Originally, Sauflon exclusively sold aftercare solution.

But
 in 1998, the industry had a breakthrough with the advent of the more 
comfortable silicone hydrogel lenses - and Mr Wells was keen to get 
involved.

Market leader: The firm, Sauflon, now has the widest product range in the industry, providing to eyecare practitioners such as Specsavers. Selling it, Mr Wells is set to take £280 million from his 40 per cent stake

It was a move that would see the pharmaceutical company dominate the industry, with the widest product range on the market.

And to his delight, Mr Wells's three sons - Gary, Bradley and David - have followed him into the business.

Success story: Alan Wells is now signing a £1.2 billion deal with a leading U.S. pharmaceutical company

One of just four companies in the world to manufacture both lenses and aftercare, Sauflon products are now sold in 50 countries around the world.

The
 group also has operations in Southampton, home to a research and 
development team and one of Sauflon's state-of-the-art contact lens 
production facilities which produces more than 100 million contact 
lenses each year.

Finally selling the firm, Mr Wells is slated to take £280 million from his 40 per cent shares, though it could be lower as the figure includes debts.

His sons are also set to benefit from the exchange.

Although the disposable contact lens 
market
 is a booming business in the UK and Europe, the industry has lagged in 
the United States - and this sale is hailed as key to its growth.

Robert
 S. Weiss, Cooper's president and chief executive officer, said, 'We are
 extremely pleased to announce this acquisition which gives CooperVision
 the world's most comprehensive portfolio of daily disposable lenses.

'CooperVision
 will now be able to offer a multi-tier daily strategy that includes a 
full suite of silicone hydrogel and hydrogel lenses, including options 
within all categories -- spheres, torics and multifocals.

'The
 daily segment is the fastest growing segment of the soft contact lens 
market and this transaction positions CooperVision as the premier 
company in this space.'

Funding the acquisition using 'off-shore' cash, the American company will avoid paying heavy taxes on the deal.
