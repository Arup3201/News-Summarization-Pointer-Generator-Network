Rescue: Eight-year-old Minnie disappeared while chasing rabbits

A Jack Russell has been reunited with its owners after it survived eight days trapped down a rabbit hole by drinking the moisture gathering on rocks.

Eight-year-old Minnie was on a woodland walk with her owners Simon and Leela Humphreys near St Cleer in Cornwall when she disappeared into the bushes chasing rabbits.

After an eight-day search proved fruitless, the couple received a phone call from a neighbour who said she could hear whimpering coming from beneath the ground in the area where Minnie vanished.

Mr and Mrs Humphreys raced to woodland with shovels and dug for over an hour before realising they would need to call in professional help as Minnie was trapped too far down for them to rescue on their own.

Thirteen firefighters subsequently attended the scene, taking over an hour to rescue Minnie from the narrow tunnel.

Mr Humphreys, a 56-year-old ecologist, said: ‘She will chase rabbits now and again but will come back after about 10 minutes later but she didn’t this time’.

He added: ‘Many of our friends and family joined in to try and look for her but we couldn’t find her anywhere… But then last Monday we got a call from our friend Fay who said she could hear whimpering’.

Alive: Other than appearing skinny, smelly and slightly panicked, Minnie escaped her ordeal unscathed

Mr Humphreys said Minnie appeared skinny, smelly and slightly panicked following her eight-day ordeal, but after a bath and some food she didn’t require any further medical attention.

Minnie is believed to have survived by drinking the water that gathered on the rocks around her.

Unseasonably mild weather and a lack of ground frost are thought to have aided her survival.

Speaking of his reunion with Minnie, 
Mr Humphreys said: ‘She was so excited when we managed to get at her, 
she was making quite a lot of noise which was pretty distressing for us 
and the firefighters.’

He added: ‘Her paws were a bit sore as she had obviously been trying to get out but she was absolutely fine.’

Mrs Humphreys, a 57-year-old GP added: ‘We are so pleased to have Minnie home and can’t thank the firefighters enough for their help. We will be making a donation to the firefighters’ charity to show our appreciation.'
