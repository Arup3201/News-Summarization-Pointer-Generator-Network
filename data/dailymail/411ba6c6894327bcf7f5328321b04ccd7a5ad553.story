'Detectives from the force’s public protection unit are working closely with the local authority as the investigation progresses and support is being offered to the boy’s family.'

Neighbour Sampson Assafuah, 41, said: 'My wife knew the woman quite well.

'We didn't know the father and they tended to keep themselves to themselves.

'They always seemed like nice enough people. We are very shocked at what has happened.

'The police have been outside the house for three days and we've only just found out why. It's a tragedy.'

Scene: Children's toys are scattered around the garden of the house. Neighbours said the boy's parents were believed to be Polish and had three children including a baby born late last year

Neighbours said the boy's parents were believed to be Polish and had three children including a baby born late last year.

Two of the children are believed to have attended the nearby Holbrooks Primary School, and were walked to school every day by their mother who a neighbour said was called 'Magda'.

The victim is likely to be named later after next of kin have been informed.

Detectives from the force's Public Protection Unit are working closely with the local authority as the investigation progresses and support is being offered to the boy's family.
