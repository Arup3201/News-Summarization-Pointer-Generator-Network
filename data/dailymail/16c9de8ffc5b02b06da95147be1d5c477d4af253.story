If ever anyone had a justified case for having road rage it has to be this truck driver in Victoria who avoided what could have been a fatal accident, not once, but twice, when a reckless driver careered into his path.  

As if to prove the theory that you can't make something idiot-proof, because someone will eventually come along and invent a new idiot, having escaped death once the dim-witted driver then speeds down the left-hand side of the truck and back into the way again.  

The truck driver was forced into taking evasive action for a second time seconds after avoiding the initial head on collision.

A black Mazda 3 hatchback smashes through a fence from out of nowhere and onto the highway

9News showed the shocking near miss where the black Mazda 3 hatchback drove through a fence from out of nowhere and onto the highway, forcing the truck driver out of his lane to avoid smashing into the other driver.

A man known only as Michael was behind the wheel of the tanker, which was doing 100km/h. He just about kept the tanker upright at first, swerving quickly to the right, across the opposite lane and onto the shoulder, before veering back to the left again. 

But just when Michael thinks the coast is clear, the Mazda cuts down past the left-hand side of the truck, apparently totally oblivious to the carnage he already almost caused.

The video was uploaded to Facebook group Dashcam Owners Australia. It was marked 2012, however the driver of the truck told the group that his date stamp was incorrect, and that it actually happened earlier this month.

The truck driver can only look on in horror as the car goes into the middle of the road 

It was taken about 30km out of Melbourne on the Western Highway, near Rockbank, on Thursday November 6, according to the group.

Police were not aware of the incident.

There's nothing for it but to take evasive action and swerve around the car to avoid a certain crash

To make matters worse, seconds later the Mazda cuts back down past the left-hand side of the truck
