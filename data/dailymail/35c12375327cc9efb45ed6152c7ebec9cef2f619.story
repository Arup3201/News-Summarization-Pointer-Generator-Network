Bolton at Home chief executive Jon Lord, pictured, defended the use of seasonal greeting cards to warn against reckless spending over Christmas

A housing association has been attacked as 'insensitive' after it sent Christmas cards to its tenants containing a notice about how far behind they are with their rent. 

Bolton at Home sent the cards which warned their tenants against over indulging over the Christmas period and ensure their rent is paid. 

The housing association apologised to any tenants who felt offended by the notices, but said they were just trying to ensure compliance with this 'gentle approach'. 

One outraged tenant told the Bolton News: 'When the card came through the door, I thought how nice it was for Bolton at Home to wish me seasons greetings.

'But when I opened it to see a reminder of my arrears and a warning about overspending at Christmas I was mortified and really angry. I found it extremely patronising.

'I felt pre-judged. I know what level of arrears I am in. It is under £150 and I am chipping away at it.

'There was just no need for this because they send us formal reminders every 12 weeks.

'It is not an easy time of year for a lot of people and I just think the way this was done could push people over the edge.'

Bolton at Home chief executive Jon Lord defended the use of seasonal cards to warn against spending recklessly over the festive period. 'We have sent these cards out for about four years and the comments we have had back suggested that people preferred this approach at this time of year compared to a heavy arrears letter.

'I fully accept that it could be taken both ways, but it is certainly not designed to offend anyone and if that has happened then I apologise.

'There is no easy way to do this but this is the first time we have had complaints about the Christmas cards and we will certainly take them on board.'

Mr Lord admitted that he has received a number of complaints that some of the cards had been sent out in unsealed envelopes. He added that it was not his intention to offend anyone during the holiday period. 

Conservative councillor Martin Cox supported the approach taken by Bolton at Home: 'Landlords will often come across as insensitive or patronising but it is a no-win situation. There is also never a good time to remind people about rent arrears.'

Bolton at Home is a registered charity which owns and manages more than 18,000 homes in the Bolton council area. 

Tenants of the Bolton at Home housing association who were in arrears received a special festive message...

...warning that they are already behind with their rent and not to overspend this Christmas

The independent Money Advice Service recommends that tenants should ensure their rent as well as other priority debts are paid because of the dire consequences associated with non-payment. 

MAS said priority debts are not necessarily the largest or the ones with the highest interest rates. 

The most important debts are mortgages, rent and any loans secured against their home. 

Failure to pay priority debts could see the householder evicted, have their gas or electricity service suspended or even jailed.

MAS recommends that once the priority debts are cleared, it is then important to target the bill with the highest interest rate and try and clear that as quickly as possible by over-paying the minimum amount. 

However, the householder should not neglect other debts, as this could lead to penalty or default charges.

According to the housing association's website, they charge a rent which is only 80 per cent of the property. 

Meanwhile, Luton Borough Council has warned its tenants not to allow their home to become someone else's Christmas present by failing to pay their rent or council tax. 

A statement released on the council's website said: 'It’s easy to spend too much money at Christmas, especially if you have children, and it may be tempting to put off paying your rent or council tax. 

'But it isn’t easy to catch up afterwards.We evicted 15 tenants for rent arrears last year and issued over 7,000 summonses to begin recovery action for council tax. 

'Up to this October, we have raised 4,372 summonses to begin recovery action; this process adds £120 to the debt already owed by each individual.'

Councillor Tom Shaw warned: 'Most people are feeling the economic squeeze at the moment, particularly with the Welfare Reform changes such as the bedroom tax kicking in. But please make paying your rent and council tax a priority over Christmas and New Year and don’t risk losing your home. 

'We want people to pay up or seek help immediately before allowing their debts to spiral out of control so we can cut the eviction rate, as well as our arrears bill.

'We work closely with the Citizens’ Advice Bureau, Luton Foodbank, local credit unions and a wide range of other organisations offering advice and support to anyone with financial problems. 

'But we will evict or take legal action when necessary against our debtors, particularly where someone won’t pay, rather than can’t pay.'
