Sonia met the Queen while out playing in Hamilton Gardens, behind the Yorks' London home aged four

One of the highlights of the Royal Childhood exhibition which opens at Buckingham Palace today is the Queen's unfinished novel, written when she was just eight.

As we revealed exclusively in Weekend last week, it was called The Happy Farm and dedicated 'To Sonia, My dear little friend and lover of horses.'

And now we can reveal who Sonia was - the girl who became 'my dear little friend' to the most famous woman in the world.

It all began in 1930 when, aged just four, Princess Elizabeth of York bumped into Sonia Graham-Hodgson while out playing in Hamilton Gardens, behind the Yorks' London home, 145 Piccadilly, a stone's throw from Hyde Park.

The meeting was significant because, as Elizabeth's governess Marion Crawford recorded, 'Sonia was the one friend whom the Queen chose for herself.'

The princess was the eldest child of George V's second son, Albert, Duke of York, and his wife the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.

Her existing circle of friends consisted of cousins - near and distant from both sides of the family - and the selected offspring of aristocrats and courtiers.

While Sonia wasn't from the highest echelons of society, she was certainly from a comfortable background. Not only was she a neighbour of the Yorks but her father, Dr Harold Graham-Hodgson, was also one of the country's leading authorities on the diagnostic use of X-rays.

In November 1928, King George V, Elizabeth's beloved 'Grandpapa England', fell dangerously ill with a streptococcal infection of the chest.

Graham-Hodgson was called in to corroborate the diagnosis. He brought his cumbersome equipment to Buckingham Palace on a lorry, fed the cables through a window and took his X-ray plates in as the king lay in bed.

It was the first time  X-rays had been taken of a patient outside a main hospital, and after his recovery the grateful monarch made the specialist a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, which was later upgraded to a knighthood by Elizabeth's father.

Two years later little Elizabeth asked the doctor's daughter, 'Will you come and play with me?' Speaking in her 80s, Sonia recalled, 'We played French cricket. She was wearing a pink and white check dress and I was wearing a blue coat,' although she conceded that seven decades later 'we always argue over what we were wearing'.

After playing for an hour in Hamilton Gardens, they left to have their tea and the princess said, 'Goodbye. See you tomorrow.'

They would go on to see each other nearly every day after that, apart from family holidays, until Elizabeth moved to Buckingham Palace seven years later.

Looking back, Sonia recalled the princess as 'a thoughtful and sensitive child, and naturally well-behaved. She never seemed aware of her position and paid no attention to the people who stood by the railings to watch her play.'

'The Duke of York relished a game of Sardines'

The girls were usually accompanied by their nannies, and occasionally left the seclusion of their private garden to play in the other London parks.

A charming press photo of the time shows the girls walking hand in hand through Hyde Park, with Sonia a good five or six inches taller than the princess despite being only eight months her senior.

The two learned to skip, played hopscotch, and took dancing lessons together. 'I suppose I was the bossy one,' Sonia admitted in 2006.

'I think it was usually me who decided what games we should play.' Sometimes Elizabeth's father joined in, particularly relishing the hide-and- seek game of Sardines. 'I remember my starchy nanny saying she found it very undignified having to hide in a bush with him.'

At first Sonia had no idea her friend was a princess, although it was soon made clear. 'I had to curtsey to the Duke and Duchess of York and to Queen Mary,' though she was allowed to call Elizabeth by her pet name of Lilibet.

The Queen's handwritten novel that she dedicated to Sonia

This changed in 1936 when, with the abdication of Edward VIII, Elizabeth's parents became king and queen and Sonia's ten-year-old friend became Heiress Presumptive.

'And so things became more formal,' Sonia remembered. 'We called her Princess and curtsied to her. She grew up a lot and became, well, more serious.'

The Royal Family moved out of their home at 145 Piccadilly and into first floor apartments at Buckingham Palace. Elizabeth's 30 toy horses went with her, apart from a favourite one called Ben, which she was concerned 'would not like being packed away in a removal van and put in storage. So she asked me to look after him,' recalled Sonia.

A couple of weeks later Elizabeth wrote and asked Sonia to come round to the palace and to bring Ben with her.

During the war Elizabeth was sent firstly to Balmoral and then to Windsor and the two girls didn't see each other for the duration.

In October 1940, at the height of the Blitz, 145 Piccadilly - which was unoccupied at the time - suffered a direct hit, destroying most of the house's back and interior. The elegant façade remained intact until the 1960s when it was pulled down to make way for a road-widening project around Hyde Park Corner and the construction of the Intercontinental Hotel between 1968 and 1975. 

Today the hotel's Wellington Lounge occupies the former site of No 145 and honours its former occupants by offering traditional afternoon teas 'for an experience fit for Royalty'.

The friends were reunited when Elizabeth took her fiancé, Lt Philip Mountbatten, with her to Sonia's 21st birthday.

'He was very good-looking and I could tell the Queen was very fond of him,' Sonia remembered. 'I was there at their wedding in Westminster Abbey and had a marvellous seat up near the front. It was all terribly impressive; and the Queen looked so happy.'

The two friends continued to meet from time to time at Sonia's house for tea or dinner parties even after Elizabeth became Queen in 1952.

'She used to say how nice it was to get out of Buckingham Palace,' and 'once she had arrived here, she was completely at ease.'

In October 1953 Sonia married Anthony Berry, who had proposed to her outside the palace on Coronation Day. With the newly crowned Elizabeth's permission, the ceremony took place at the Queen's Chapel, St James's Palace, and the Dean of Windsor officiated.

Berry was a director of the prestigious London wine firm, Berry Bros & Rudd, based at 3 St James's Street, which has supplied the British Royal Family since the reign of George III.

He and Sonia had two children, a daughter Victoria and a son Simon. The latter is now chairman of the family firm and in 2007, to the delight of his parents, became Clerk of the Royal Cellars, responsible for drawing up the royal wine list and selecting wines and spirits for the Queen's cellar at Buckingham Palace and other official residences.

The Berrys retired to a spacious apartment in a Georgian crescent in Bath, where signed photos of the young Elizabeth were a reminder of her special royal friendship.

'She used to say how nice it was to get out of Buckingham Palace, once she had arrived at my house, she was completely at ease'

Sonia was occasionally invited to royal parties and in March 2004 was at the Ritz Hotel when the Queen hosted a gathering for friends and family. The two also exchanged letters and cards and in 2006 Sonia sent the Queen an 80th birthday greeting and a silk scarf as a present.

In a rare public comment that year she paid tribute to her friend and monarch. 'She has taken the job tremendously seriously and made a great success of it. The Queen was determined that she would work hard; not just enjoy the privileges.

'She has wonderful dedication. She is absolutely steadfast and sets an example to other people. Perhaps at one point she was a little too remote - out of shyness - but that has changed too. I feel terribly privileged to have been her friend for so long. I am very lucky.'

Sonia Berry died peacefully at home on 16 March, 2012, at the age of 86, two years after the death of her husband.

They left their two children, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild. She also left many memories for the Queen of a special relationship that began on a summer's day over eight decades earlier when a four-year-old princess, isolated in that rarefied world of pre-war royalty, just needed someone to play with.

Royal Childhood is part of a visit to the Summer Opening of the State Rooms at Buckingham Palace, 26 July-28 September, 2014. www.royalcollection.org.uk. The accompanying book, Royal Childhood: A Souvenir Album, is published by the Royal Collection Trust, £9.95 (£12.95 in bookshops).
