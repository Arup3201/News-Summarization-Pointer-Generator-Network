More than four-fifths of people cannot identify an ash tree from its leaves and almost half cannot recognise an oak, a survey has revealed.

Members of the public are being encouraged to report signs of diseases which are threatening British trees, such as ash dieback, as part of efforts to tackle infection which could wipe out millions of trees across the countryside.

But many people cannot even identify some of the UK's most common trees that are at risk, a poll conducted for the Woodland Trust suggests.

Spot the difference: Four in five people could not identify an ash tree (left) by its leaves, while half did not recognise an oak tree (right), the survey by the Woodland Trust found

Only 17 per cent of those shown an ash leaf could say what tree it came from, despite the high profile of Chalara ash dieback, which experts have warned could have the same effect on ash trees as Dutch elm disease had on British elms.

And 57 per cent could identify an oak, one of the country's most common and recognisable trees.

Oaks are at risk from disease such as acute oak decline, which causes bleeding and lesions on stems and tree death.

One in 10 mis-identified an oak leaf as coming from a sycamore tree, the survey of 2,050 adults by YouGov revealed found.

The situation is most acute among young people who appear to be losing touch with nature, with less than two-fifths (39 per cent) able to identify an oak tree from its leaf and only one in 10 able to identify an ash leaf.

Older people were best able to recognise trees, with more than two-thirds (68 per cent) of over-55s identifying an oak and almost a quarter (23 per cent) able to correctly name an ash leaf.

The Trust said it needs people to report signs of disease, such as ash dieback (pictured)

Those in north-east England and Northern
Ireland struggled most to correctly identify oak leaves, with just 40 
per cent getting it right, while less than one in 10 (9 per cent) people
in the North East could name an ash leaf.

The Woodland Trust is warning that a lack of knowledge about trees among members of the public could hamper efforts to stop the increasing risk of pests and diseases which UK trees face.

Austin Brady, head of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said: 'We are relying on people to report the signs of disease and pests in their local woods, so if more people were able to identify common trees like ash and oak, it would make tracking the spread easier.

'We are calling for increased education on native trees and disease identification before it's too late.

'We need to learn about and love trees and woods or we risk losing them.'

He added that there was a clear trend from the findings that younger people were less engaged with nature.

There were currently 15 tree diseases listed by the Forestry Commission as being present in the country, with another five with the potential to arrive here, he said.

'It is of massive importance that we give everyone the skills to help tackle tree diseases, otherwise our native trees will be under threat.

'In order to tackle diseases and pests and protect our trees from future threats, it's imperative we increase the nation's understanding,' he said.
