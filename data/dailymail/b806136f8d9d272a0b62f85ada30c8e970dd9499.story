He has admittedly publicly that the White House underestimate the terror threat from ISIS. But Saturday Night Live took Obama's confession a step further - by having him admit that jihadists outperform the U.S. government on Twitter.

The comedy show had performer Jay Pharaoh play the President in a sketch going into detail on how jihadists fighting in Syria and Iraq have him on the ropes when it comes to hashtags, emojis - and even dating apps.

In his best Obama voice, Pharoah took part in a 60 Minutes-style interview which also made light of recent failures in the Secret Service - and the Ebola crisis.

'They can maximize faves': Jay Pharaoh played Obama - and admitted that ISIS had outfoxed the administration on social media

Mocked: 'Obama' confessed that terrorist Twitter accounts had baffled him - and lamented their skilled use of emojis

At the opening of the NBC show, Beck Bennett, posing as CBS host Steve Kroft, asked how the Obama administration had been outfoxed by ISIS.

In reply, the 'President' said: 'We underestimated how effective ISIS would be at social media - they really blew us out of the water.

'These terrorists have nothing to do - they can be tweeting all day. They can maximize faves as well as RTs.

'Why was the CIA on Tinder?' The sketch also coined the acronym D.T.J. - Down to Jihad

He then threw out some examples, exposing their 'tactics' of using emojis and trending hashtags to put across their messages by stealth.

He offered example tweets like: 'Hearing cool stuff about Sharia law. I'ma check it out. Then there's an emoji of a ghost with an eye patch.'

He also suggested: 'Loving this new show "Selfie" on ABC. P.S. can you believe Israel is still a state?' and 'We will destroy the infidels #thankyoujeter'

Scary: Saturday Night Live later moved on to parodying the Ebola crisis - with a mock-up movie trailer for a sequel to The Fault In Our Stars

Health scares: The fake trailer made light of the disease ravaging West Africa

The mock-Obama also made jokes about the CIA finding profiles on Tinder marked DTJ - Down to Jihad - a play on a popular dating acronym on the network.

When asked why the agents were on the app in the first place he simply said: 'That's not important'

The interview was cut short when a Secret Service agent blundered onstage telling Obama he had an urgent meeting with 'a man with a sharpened screwdriver'.

Saturday Night Live later moves on to a mock movie trailer - a sequel to The Fault in Our Stars in which the love interest, played by host Sarah Silverman - has the deadly virus.

She is shown falling for a leading man - who reciprocates but always stays at least 5ft away from her - or wears hazmat gear.

Her suggestion that they 'take a plane somewhere' is not rapturously received. 

'Maybe we should take a plane'? The trailer, starring host Sarah Silverman, deployed trademark risqué humor
