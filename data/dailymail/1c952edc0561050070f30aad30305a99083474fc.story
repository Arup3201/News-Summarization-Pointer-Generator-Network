Netflix has reached a deal with Comcast to ensure that its TV shows and movies are streamed smoothly to Comcast customers, the first deal the online video streaming service has reached with an internet service provider.

The two companies said in a joint statement today they're establishing a more direct connection to provide a better service to customers that will also allow for future growth in Netflix traffic. 

The companies claim Netflix will not receive preferential network treatment under the multi-year deal, however the terms of the deal have not been disclosed.

The Wall Street Journal reported the landmark agreement could set a precedent for Netflix's dealings with other broadband providers.

In exchange for payment, Netflix will get direct access to Comcast's broadband network.

The news comes after Comcast agreed to buy Time Warner Cable Inc. which, if approved by the regulator, would establish Comcast as by far the dominant provider of broadband in the U.S. serving 30 million households.

Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said he decided to strike the deal after Netflix streaming speeds for Comcast subscribers began deteriorating.

According to January data, the average speeds of Netflix's prime-time streams to Comcast subscribers had dropped 27 percent since October. 

Hastings and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts have reportedly met several times in recent months to discuss the deal.
