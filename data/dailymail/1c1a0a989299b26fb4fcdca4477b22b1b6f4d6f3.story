The 'father of supercross' Michael Goodwin has been denied a chance to appeal a double murder charge in the 1988 slayings of auto racing legend Mickey Thompson and his wife Trudy.

The 69-year-old is serving life in prison without parole for the mysterious killing of the couple, who were gunned down in the driveway of their suburban Los Angeles home.

Circumstantial evidence showed he hired two hit men to kill the couple to avenge a soured business deal before 'fleeing' overseas for more than a decade.

On Monday a three-judge panel at the Los Angeles Court of Appeals unanimously rejected Goodwin's numerous claims of prejudicial errors in his 2007 trial. 

'I hope Mick and Trudy are looking down,' said Collene Campbell, Thompson's sister. 

'When you spend half of your life trying to have somebody convicted of a killing you know that they did, it's a tough one to wait this long. ... If it was overturned, you'd go back to square one.'

Defense attorney Gail Harper called it the 'shakiest hitman case' she'd ever seen and argued there was insufficient evidence connecting Goodwin to the gunmen, who were never identified.

In her 500-page appeal, she argued there were numerous flaws - evidence improperly being introduced; errors in jury instructions; and prosecutorial misconduct, to name a few.

Harper told the court during arguments in October that her client was an angry jerk, but that was no crime.

In rejecting her claim that the prosecutor acted in bad faith by promising evidence in opening statements that he failed to produce at trial, the appellate court dismissed the 'defendant's often hyperbolic (and sometimes misleading) claims.'

Harper said she was disappointed and numb with the conclusion of the 164-page decision, but she hadn't read it yet. 

She had not shared the news with Goodwin.

Harper expected to file a petition for review with the California Supreme Court.

Thompson gained fame pursuing land-speed records on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, driving dragsters and funny cars, and popularizing off-road competitions.

Goodwin, the creator of the popular sport of Supercross, attempted to merge his highly successful business with Thompson's stadium off-road racing enterprise in 1985. But after only three months, the partnership failed.

The men battled in court for more than three years until a judge issued an order for Goodwin to pay Thompson more than $700,000.

Evidence showed that Goodwin told others he would see Thompson dead before he paid him a dime.

Harper argued that threats are not sufficient for conviction.

'You can threaten till you're blue in the face,' she said. 'But if there's no connection between him and the people who did the killing, it's fatal to the case.'

She argued that the killings occurred during a robbery.

But the evidence showed the killers left behind jewelry and cash.

Witnesses said they saw Goodwin casing the area with binoculars days before the killings. There also were reports during the trial that Goodwin had imported hit men from the Caribbean.

Prosecutors showed that Goodwin had liquidated his assets around the time of the killings, bought a $400,000 yacht and sailed off with his then-wife to spend years in the Caribbean and elsewhere. 

He was arrested in 2001 when he returned to the U.S.

The mystery might have died in a cold case file if not for Thompson's sister, Collene Campbell, who spent two decades pushing for Goodwin's arrest.
