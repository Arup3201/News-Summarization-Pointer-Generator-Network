Players can often be seen before a big game nowadays with earphones in as they try to drown out any distractions during their pre-match routine.

Sometimes though, it is better to soak it all in. 

At a packed-out Celtic Park heaving with 60,000 Scotland and England fans, Gary Neville implored midfielder Jack Wilshere to take out his earphones and enjoy the building atmosphere.

Neville was also trying to impart a message to the Arsenal star on a night when England faced the Scots north of the border for the first time in 15 years.

Wilshere's attention to detail was called into question by Wayne Rooney soon after kick-off when the England captain remonstrated with the Gunner over a careless pass in the early stages.

The midfielder recovered, however, and laid on a superb pass for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's opener. Incredibly, it was Wilshere's first assist in an England shirt.

He drove on his side from his less familiar deep-lying midfield position - a role which he is growing into for his country - as the visitors won 3-1.

After that display, maybe Wilshere should jettison the earphones for good.
