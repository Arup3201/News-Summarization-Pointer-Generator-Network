A southwest Missouri youth football coach accused of kidnapping and killing a 10-year-old girl is now also facing rape and sodomy charges.

Greene County prosecutors added the new charges against Craig Michael Wood, 46, of Springfield on Monday. Court documents indicate the additional charges in the February death of Hailey Owens stem from newly available autopsy results.

The fourth-grader was abducted while walking home from her best friend's house, just two blocks from her own home. Neighbors reported watching in horror and unsuccessfully giving chase as Hailey was pulled into a pickup truck that sped away. She was found dead hours later in the basement of Wood's home.

Wood is scheduled for a preliminary 
hearing Thursday, but public defender Patrick Berrigan said in a brief 
interview that he plans to ask for a delay because of the new charges.

'We'll file a request to strike, or to postpone the hearing,' he said Tuesday.

Wood
 was a 16-year football coach at a middle school in Springfield, about 
160 miles southeast of Kansas City. He also worked as a substitute 
teacher and teacher's aide overseeing suspensions.

A police search of his home found child pornography and more than a dozen guns, according to search warrants.

Prosecuting
 Attorney Dan Patterson has said Hailey was shot in the back of the head
 and had ligature marks on her wrists, suggesting she was tied up. The 
prosecutor, who has said he is considering whether to seek the death 
penalty, declined to further discuss the new charges.

Wood
 had little criminal history, according to online court records. He 
pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance in 1990 in Greene
 County and was fined $100.

Wood
 also was convicted in 2001 for illegal taking of wildlife, a 
misdemeanor. Friends said Wood is an amateur bluegrass musician and 
hunter who never married or had children and whose parents raised show 
horses.

Wood is already 
facing charges of murder, child kidnapping and armed criminal action. 
Hailey's biological parents filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Wood 
last month.

The 
heartbreaking revelation that the girl was also raped and sodomized 
comes a few weeks after her mother came face-to-face with the suspect 
for the first time.

Hailey Owens' body was found stuffed in trash bags in Wood's basement. On
 March 26, Wood appeared in court for a preliminary hearing.

Wood arrived in court clean-shaven and
 with short hair. He kept his eyes down throughout the short hearing on 
legal motions and never once looked over at where Hailey's family, 
including her mom Stacey Barfield, was sitting.

Earlier last month, thousands of people held a candlelight vigil and walked through Springfield in honor of Hailey.

As many as 10,000 people took place in the show of solidarity, officials told the News-Leader, and they remembered the young girl for how she lived - not how horribly she died.

'There
 are no words to describe our community's broken heart,' Mayor Pro Tem 
Jeff Seifried said, according to the paper. 'There are no words to 
describe our frustration. The unthinkable has happened in our 
community.'

Others chose to focus on the positive energy the fourth grade student infused everyone she came in touch with.

'Tonight is about Hailey, not the crime,' Angela Boeddeker told the paper. She brought yellow ribbons for people to wear.

'I just knew her as a friend,' fifth-grader Russell Wise recalled. 'A good nice friend.'

'She was a nice friend,' twin Kyle said. 'She was creative and fun to play with.'

Musician: Wood's band, Uncle Fudd, also released a statement following the killing, saying: 'Uncle Fudd would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Hailey Owens.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this devastating time'

'Many
 changed the words from 'This little light of mine' to 'this is Hailey’s
 light, I’m going to let it shine' while marching through the small 
city.

The slain girl's
family also cried while walking in the procession.

Jim and Genie Wood, the presumed killer's parents, said through a family 
spokesman that they 'join the rest of the community in praying as their 
hearts pour out to the Owens family.'

Wood
 was driving his parent's car when he allegedly abducted fourth grader 
Hailey Owens from a suburban street one February evening, throwing her into 
the vehicle 'like a rag doll' before speeding off.

Early the next morning, the little girl's body was found is trash bags in the basement of Wood's Springfield home.

'She's
 in heaven. With angel wings,' Hailey's devastated mother, Stacey 
Barfield, told KYTV as she visited a makeshift memorial where 
her daughter was abducted. 'At least she's not hurting.'

With Hailey's aunt Sara Wells and another relative, Barfield broke down sobbing as she knelt beside 
the memorial. They had gathered at the abduction site to 
retrieve some of the dozens of floral arrangements and stuffed animals 
left by well-wishers.

Wells called her niece a bubbly girl who loved to laugh, smile and dance. 'She was pure gold,' Wells said.

Meanwhile, Hailey's father, Markus Owens, told a local TV station, 'All I can say right now is I miss her and I love her.'

Hailey was remembered as a vivacious 
spirit - a trusting little girl whose cheery disposition only deepened 
the heartbreak the community is trying to make sense of.

'It
 has completely shocked this community,' Joe Bridges, a Springfield 
resident who has helped organize a weekend vigil in the little girl’s 
memory, told the Kansas City Star.

'People
 can't believe this would happen. It's just the fact that she wasn't far
 from her home, then instantly, poof, she's gone.'

Public anger was still palpable in the tight-knit community, as questions persist about the suspect's 
background and motive.

Wood, a 16-year football coach at a middle school
 who also worked as a substitute teacher and teacher's aide overseeing 
suspensions, was allegedly found by police holding duct tape as he left 
his father's pickup truck parked outside his home after the abduction.

Court
 records indicate the girl's body was found stuffed in two trash bags 
inside plastic storage containers in the basement of Wood's home, which 
was damp with bleach - presumably used to clean the crime scene.

Greene
 County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Patterson 
said Hailey was shot in the back of the head and had ligature marks on 
her wrists, suggesting she was tied up.

At least three people told police they saw Hailey as she was pulled inside a pickup truck that had driven back and forth several times down the street before the driver stopped to ask the girl for directions. One homeowner gave chase on foot, and another followed the fleeing truck in his own car.

Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams defended his officers' response time as well as efforts by the Missouri Highway Patrol, which didn't issue an Amber Alert until 103 minutes after the girl's kidnapping was first reported to 911.

'It's a time-consuming process,' he said.

Wells reiterated previous statements by 
officials that despite Wood's status as a school employee, he and Hailey
 apparently didn't know each other.

Hailey's home and Westport Elementary are on the city's west side; Wood worked at Pleasant View School, which is 12 miles away north of Springfield, and lived on the city's east  side.

Springfield School District officials have said their employment screening process found no warning signs when hiring Wood - first as a temporary employee in 1998 and then full time eight years later.

Wood's band, Uncle Fudd, also released a statement after the killing, according to KSPR, saying: 'Uncle Fudd would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Hailey Owens. Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this devastating time.'

Police spokeswoman Lisa Cox said there is no indication that Wood is a suspect in any other violent crime involving children.
