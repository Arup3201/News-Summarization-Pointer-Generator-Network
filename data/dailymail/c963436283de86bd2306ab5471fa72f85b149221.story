Bali Nine ringleader Andrew Chan has written a letter to his younger self, warning of the poor decisions that would lead him to end up in jail for drug smuggling and imploring Australian kids not to follow his mistakes.

The six-page letter was written by Chan, who is scheduled to be executed by firing squad this year, was penned from inside his Bali cell in Kerobokan Prison, where he has spent almost a decade dwelling on the actions that brought him there. 

In the letter, which features in the new documentary 'Dear Me: The Dangers of Drugs', Chan asks young Australians to question themselves before they make any potential life-altering decisions.

Bali Nine ringleader has penned a letter to his 15-year-old self to warn young Australians off drugs

'I don’t know what choices you guys are making, however, if anything, I would want you guys to remember is, ‘Is it worth it?’,' Chan says in the film.

'You are still young and you have some serious decisions to make in your life. What you choose today will make what you become tomorrow. If you want to be a thug and a big bad wolf, I’ll see you soon inside,' reported The Herald Sun.

Arrested at 21 for his role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling ring, Chan has had many years 'to look at himself and he is reformed,' said the documentary's maker, Malinda Rutter. 

Chan has reportedly turned his life around, becoming a leader at the prison and running bible studies and mentoring other prisoners.

'For those that want to do something in life, I’d like you guys to see how important it is to put your head down and study hard.'

In the documentary, Chan addresses his 15-year-old self in the hope that the young Australians the film is aimed at will see how stark his future may be. 

'Dear me, when you are older you will be in a Bali prison and you will be executed,' Chan says.

'This happened to you because you thought taking drugs was cool.'

Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006

In the film, Chan explains that he became involved with drugs at an early age, and by the time he was 15, was heavily using the substances that would eventually lead him to jail. 

'Your drug taking made you think it was ok to import drugs and make money from this. Your family and friends are heartbroken and your life will be ended by firing squad'.

'Really, underneath you are not a bad person, and drugs made you different,' Chan ends. 

He says in the film that he has made some bad decisions, and is not proud for many of his actions. 

Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006, and could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases.

The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite.  

Despite Indonesian President Joko Widodo vowing not to grant pardons for drug smugglers, the attorney-general's spokesman, Tony Spontana, said that there was a chance for the executions to be delayed.

'But with regards to death penalty, we have the mechanism to review the decision,' Mr Spontana said.

'Starting from the decision made by the District Court all the way to decision in Judicial Review, including the clemency decision,' reported The ABC.  

 Sukamaran has been in the same Bali jail as Chan for nearly a decade

Mr McMahon, their Australian lawyer, said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system

Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution

If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled.

The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest. 

Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th, while Chan's plea is yet to be finalised. 

Their fate rests heavily on Chan's clemency bid, as the pair have been informed that they will face execution together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia.

Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot.

'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said.

Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad.

Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.'

'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan.

Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them.

'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said.

News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf. 

Mr Abbott said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution, but admitted he would not risk jeopardising diplomatic relations.
