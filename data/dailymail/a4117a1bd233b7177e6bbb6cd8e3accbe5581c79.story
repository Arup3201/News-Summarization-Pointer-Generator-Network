An eight-month-old baby suffocated after she 'wriggled' down her parents' bed and became trapped between the mattress and the frame as her family held a party downstairs, an inquest heard.

Halima Saida Ali was found unconscious by her mother Shaheen at the foot of the bed at the family home in Derby on August 25 last year.

Although the little girl was taken to hospital and later transferred to a specialist unit, she died two weeks later at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.

Eight-month-old Halima Saida Ali suffocated after wriggling down her parents' bed and becoming trapped in the frame as her family held a party downstairs at their home in this street in Derby, an inquest heard

A coroner has ruled that the baby's death was accidental after hearing police could find no evidence of neglect. 

The inquest into Halima's death, at Derby Coroner's Court was told that there was a party taking place at the Ali family home on the night she was taken to hospital, and that the baby had only been left for a short amount of time.

Finding their baby, Mrs Ali and her husband Ashad, who works as an administrator, had called for an ambulance and, under the instructions of paramedics, the family had performed CPR on the child in an attempt to save her.  

When the ambulance arrived, Halima was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital, and was later  transferred to the intensive care ward at Queen's Medical Centre, where she died on September 7.

Detective Inspector Tony Brittan, who attended the family home on the day Halima was taken to hospital, told the hearing he was content that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.

He said the baby had appeared to have wriggled in her sleep before becoming stuck.

'Halima was found by her family with her head stuck under the footboard and her feet hanging down towards the floor,' the police officer said.

'There were no signs of trauma in the bedroom where she was found.

'The family had completed CPR on the directions of the ambulance service.

'There was no sign of any criminal negligence. It was a tragic accident.'

Louise Pinder, assistant coroner for Derby, asked if there had been any chance of survival for the baby, despite the best efforts of the family and hospital staff to keep her alive.

DI Brittan replied: 'There was a very weak pulse towards the end of her resuscitation.

'It was clear from the start she was not going to survive that particular incident.'

A post mortem examination showed Halima died of a positional asphyxiation - meaning she had suffocated due to the position she had wriggled into.

Miss Pinder said: 'Halima, a much loved and well cared-for eight-month-old baby girl, was found unresponsive, having only been left alone for a short period of time.

'It is likely she became trapped between the footboard and the mattress at the bottom of the bed.

'It was quickly established she had no chance of survival. She died on September 7 last year and she died as a result of accidental death.'
