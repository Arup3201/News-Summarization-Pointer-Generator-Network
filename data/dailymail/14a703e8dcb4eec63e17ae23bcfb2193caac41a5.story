Images of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley gyrating in her underwear were designed to improve sales of her lingerie range at Marks & Spencer.

However, the moving video posters left little to the imagination and drew complaints that they were overtly sexual, explicit and even degrading to women.

But the Advertising Standards Agency has today dismissed those complaints ruling that the advert was not too raunchy and designed to show the range off 'in the best possible light'.

'Not overtly sexy': The model was promoting the range that she designed for the high street giant

The 25-year-old British model and actress has been proven to have something of the Midas touch for brands she is associated with, including M&S and Burberry.

Certainly, her lingerie range has been one of the few success stories at M&S, which has gone through troubled times in recent months.

The first video poster showed her in a green bra and knickers, turning as if posing in front of a mirror, while the second involved similar poses in a purple bra and knickers.

The third, in which she wore a flowered pattern lingerie set, was the most risqué in that she was seen turning and showing her bare back and much of her bottom.

Some people who saw the advertisements felt they were overtly sexual and unsuitable to be seen by children, while a number complained that they reinforced sexual stereotypes of women.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has issued a ruling today rejecting a total of seven complaints and clearing the video posters to run again.

Sales boost: The high street giant said that the adverts were designed to be 'soft' and 'sophisticated'

The watchdog said it accepted that some people would find the nudity in the ads distasteful, however it said the images were not likely to cause serious or widespread offence.

In its defence, M&S said it had ensured the video posters were not displayed near schools, while the images were deliberately designed to be ‘filmic’, ‘sophisticated’ and ‘soft’.

The chain said the approach had been very successful, while the intention was to appeal to women ‘as opposed to being designed for the titillation of men’.

The ASA said: ‘Marks & Spencer said the purpose of the campaign was not to show Rosie as being overtly sexy but to show the product off in the best light.

‘M&S said additionally the brand values were that the range should stand for making women feel attractive and sensual from the confidence of wearing elegant and sophisticated lingerie.

‘They refuted any allegation that the range or supporting campaign was degrading to women or reinforced sexual stereotypes of women.’

The Advertising Standards Agency has banned an advert offering £2,000 loans in ten minutes at annual interest rates of more than 250 per cent because it is 'socially irresponsible'.

The advert for personal loan firm Pounds to Pocket drew three complaints after promising viewers

'No paperwork. No guarantor... No surprises or hidden fees, just fixed payments over 12 months.'

But one viewer said that the APR of 278 per cent was only shown in small print and not featured prominently enough.

Two more questioned claims by a customer in the advert that he had been turned down by mainstream banks and should have gone to Pounds to Pocket first.

'Socially irresponsible': An advert for Pounds to Pocket has been banned by the Advertising Standards Agency

They complained that it was socially irresponsible because it promotes the firm as a preferable option despite its considerably higher interest rates.

Pounds to Pocket said that the APR was prominently included in the legal text, where applicable, and was held on screen for longer than the minimum on-screen hold time required.

They said that the 'I wish I'd gone to Pounds to Pocket first' claim was an actual endorsement from a real customer.

But the ASA upheld both complaints and banned the ad.

A spokesman said that a 20 per cent discount on repayments offer had featured more prominently than the APR.

He said: "Because the RAPR (representative annual percentage rate) had not been given greater prominence than the incentive, we concluded that the ad breached the Code.

Upholding the second complaint he said: 'We considered the character's comment that "I was turned down by the mainstream lenders. I wish I'd gone to Pounds to Pocket first, as their application was fast and simple" implied that credit was available to persons who might otherwise consider their access to credit restricted.'
