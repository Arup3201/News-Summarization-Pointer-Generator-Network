Some drug dealers choose to disguise themselves with dark sunglasses, while others often go for a hoodie or balaclava to hide their faces.

But one cannabis seller was today unmasked as a university student, bizarrely hiding behind a cardboard cut-out Where’s Wally mask.

The University of Sheffield second-year student, known only as ‘Jim’, was caught out by a reporter after selling him £20 of the class B drug.

The Wally dealer, who was driving an old blue Ford Mondeo, sold the drug to the journalist before asking him if he wanted to try anything else.

He told the Daily Star Sunday: ‘I always wear this when it is people I don’t know. I have my regulars around the campus and can get you anything.’

Jim claimed that he had almost sold out of his drugs stash after bumper sales to rock music fans at the Leeds Festival last month.

He said he was also looking forward to shifting drugs to all the first-year students arriving in Sheffield for the new term later this month.

Jim was contacted by the Daily Star Sunday after a reporter saw his advert on a website used by dealers and users.

'Using the net to meet people is quick and easy, though you do have to take the odd precaution - hence the mask'

He said: ‘Using the net to meet people is quick and easy, though you do have to take the odd precaution - hence the mask.’

The reporter was said to have 'carefully disposed' of the drug after buying it from the dealer.

Where’s Wally is a classic series of children's picture books created by London-born illustrator Martin Handford, 55.

The books have sold more than 43million copies worldwide in 33 countries and 22 languages, and celebrate their 25th anniversary this year.
