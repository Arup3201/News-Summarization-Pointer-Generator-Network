It might have been a smart choice for an upmarket restaurant, but Lord Snowdon's tweed jacket was not enough to keep out the cold as he waited for a taxi after enjoying Sunday lunch.

The former royal photographer was caught out by the winter weather as he left La Famiglia, in Chelsea, where he dined with his former wife, Lucy, the Countess of Snowdon, last weekend.

It was so chilly that Ms Lindsay-Hogg, to whom Lord Snowdon was married for 22 years, had to give the frail 84-year-old her coat as they strolled through the London borough after the meal.

Distinguished: Lord Snowdon was married to Princess Margaret from 1960 to 1978. The couple are seen together at Buckingham Palace on their wedding day (left) and on a pontoon in the Bahamas in 1967 (right) 

The pair, who married months after Lord Snowdon's divorce to Princess Margaret in 1978, divorced in 2000 amid allegations of the photographer's extra-marital affairs. 

But they looked relaxed in each other's company as they made their way out of the restaurant on Sunday - with Lord Snowdon being wheeled out by the Maitre d' after the meal. 

Lord Snowdon, who became the royal photographer after his marriage to Princess Margaret, now dedicates much of his time to vaccinating children across the globe against polio.

He shared a joke with the Maitre d' on the pavement as Ms Lindsay-Hogg walked to the end of the road to hail a taxi.

When the black cab arrived, the driver stepped out and appeared to apologise for not being able to accommodate the wheelchair as his car was an older model. 

Before he and his former wife set off for a stroll, Ms Lindsay-Hogg kindly took off her black coat and draped it over Lord Snowdon - keeping him sheltered from the bitter wind.

After his divorce to Princess Margaret amid rumours of her extra-marital affair, Lord Snowdon married Ms Lindsay-Hogg, the former wife of film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg.

The marriage ended in divorce in 2000, this time facing allegations that Lord Snowdon was having an affair. There have been a number of similar claims made over the years.

Earlier this year, Lord Snowdon donated a series of his photographs, including ones of David Bowie, Dame Maggie Smith and Sir Laurence Olivier to the National Portrait Gallery.

The photographer turned his lens on the worlds of theatre, fashion and high society when he began his career in the 1950s. He later became the royal photographer after his marriage to Princess Margaret.

He is known for his six-decade association with Vogue and in the early 1960s worked with the Sunday Times Magazine on documentary subjects from mental health to loneliness.

The donation of 130 photographs from Lord Snowdon's archive is one of the largest gifts ever received by the gallery, and several of the portraits went on display for the first time this autumn. 

They are open to view in an exhibition, titled, Snowden: A Life in View, until June 2015.
