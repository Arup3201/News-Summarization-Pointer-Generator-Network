The explosive opinions and revelations contained in Roy Keane's new book have captured the headlines all week - yet a Tesco store in Ireland has still found a novel way to boost sales of the autobiography.

The franchise in Wilton, Cork, has taken the rather amusing way of publicising the sale of the book by offering a free prawn sandwich to any person who purchases The Second Half.

A sign, positioned next to the books in the store, reads: 'Free Prawn Sandwich with every copy of the Roy Keane Book, The Second Half. Just take your receipt to the deli counter for your free sandwich.'

This references the former Republic of Ireland midfielder's famous interview in November 2000 when he referred to Manchester United fans at Old Trafford as eating 'prawn sandwiches' and being unaware of the action on the pitch.

Keane's rant - directed at fans who voiced their disapproval during United's Champions League home match with Dynamo Kiev - infamously became linked with the term 'the prawn sandwich brigade'.

During the interview, Keane said: 'Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans.

The Champions League clash with Kiev was the match which prompted Keane's 'prawn sandwich' rant

Keane argued that United's fans were too busy eating prawn sandwiches than watching the football

'But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch.'

The ex-United, Nottingham Forest and Celtic midfielder's new book was launched during a press conference at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin on Thursday.

In The Second Half, among other revelations, the Aston Villa and Ireland assistant manager explains his disdain for Sir Alex Ferguson's criticism of former United players, he talks through the bitter row which led to his exit from Old Trafford, and how he does not regret his horror challenge on Alf-Inge Haaland.

He also says he knew Cristiano Ronaldo would be one of the world's best players when he left John O'Shea needing medical attention due to dizziness while playing for Sporting Lisbon in a friendly.
