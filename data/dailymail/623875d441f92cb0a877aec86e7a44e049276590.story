FAI chief executive John Delaney has been forced to apologise after being caught singing a pro-IRA song in a Dublin bar last week.

The video, during which the 47-year-old joined in with the song Joe McDonnell, was posted online after Ireland's win against Jurgen Klinsmann's USA.

Delaney was forced to defend his actions when talking to radio station 2FM on Tuesday morning, but did express disappointed that it had been shot in a 'sly way'.

The timing is embarrassing given that the Republic of Ireland are due to host England in March and Roy Hodgson having apologised last week for England fans singing 'No Surrender' during the match against Scotland and Celtic Park. 

The song was written to honour the memory of McDonnell, a member of the Provisional IRA to die on hunger striker in 1981.

'Joe McDonnell was a song that sang in my presence and I chipped in with on a number of occasions in the past,' Delaney, who was singing in the Bath pub near Ireland's Aviva Stadium, said.

'I'm not someone who supports violence at all. In fact over a large number of years I have been working closely with cross-border initiatives in football to break down barriers.

'I'm not a violent person. My grand-father fought in the Civil War and he also fought in the War of Independence. I have always said I have a nationalist background.

'When you sing a song like that you don't believe in every word that is in the song.

'I sing a large number of songs and it's normally done in a private way when there is a sing-song. It's a typically Irish thing we do, we sing songs amongst a group and you expect that to be kept within the group.

'Unfortunately on occasions people use camera phones in a sly way when they are not in your company and then they try to make something bigger out of it.

'If the song offends anyone of course I'm sorry, it's not in my nature to want to offend people.'

Delaney said that the Ireland team have often joined in singing of similar songs going back to Jack Charlton's time in charge, such as 'Sean South from Garryowen' which is about another IRA member.

He added: 'I'll give you an example. Sean South from Garryowen has been sung on the Irish team bus for years, from the Jack Charlton era, right up to the current era.

'If people want to tape these things in what I would call a sly way, and then try to make them public, it is wrong. But I do accept that if I have upset anybody here, I'm sorry.

'Many of us have a nationalist background but are non-violent and sing songs but don't believe in all of the lyrics.'
