This amazing series of pictures captures the famous Red Arrows display team while they fly above RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.

The selfie-style shots show the squadron forming up just feet from the wings of their fellow pilot as they practice their performance.

The pilotsâ€™ routines see them fly at speeds of up to 600 miles an hour, swooping as low as 100 feet and pulling up to 8Gs during the Vixen Break manoeuvre.

In 8G everything weighs 8 times more, and so it can be difficult for photographers to capture images as it is almost impossible to hold the camera up to eye level. The force will also drain blood away from the eyes and brain and into the legs, which can cause black out.

These pictures were captured by expert Katsuhiko Tokunaga who is one of just ten air-to-air photographers in the world, and who has worked with the Red Arrows on several occasions.

The 'selfie' style shots were captured from the cockpit of one of the Arrows as his co-pilots form up just feet from the tips of his wings

The Red Arrows began training in 1964 and had their first display season in 1965. The red in their name comes from the fact that RAF training aircraft of the day were red, and the arrow references another famous display team, the Black Arrows

Katsuhiko Tokunaga is just one of ten licensed air-to-air photographers in the world and has worked with the Red Arrows on several different occasions

As the team perform their aerial acrobatics they will fly as low as 100 feet, pull up to 8Gs of force and travel at up to 600 miles an hour, all while coming within feet of each other's aircraft

At 8G, everything weighs eight times as much, making photography very difficult as it is almost impossible to keep hold a camera level with your eye

The team's new tail design, to mark 50 year since it began flying, can be seen in the pictures. The Union Jack-style design is the most significant change to the livery of the aircraft in the group's history

The Red Arrows have always flown whichever aircraft is in service as the Royal Air Force's advanced fast jet trainer; currently the BAE SYSTEMS Hawk T1

Each of the nine Red Arrows display pilots is chosen by a selection board and flies with the team for a three-year tour of duty

The pilots wear special anti-G suits in order to keep blood evenly distributed around the body. Under that amount of pressure blood can drain away from a pilot's head and brain, causing loss of vision and blackouts

The vapour trails are created by pumping diesel fuel into the jet exhaust which heats to over 500 degrees Celsius. The diesel immediately vaporises creating a white cloud, with dye added to make it blue or red
