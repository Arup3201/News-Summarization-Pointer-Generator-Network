An ex-Manchester City defender on trial at Manchester United stole the show in a game between Louis van Gaal's fringe first-team players and the club's Under 21 side.

Sadik El Fitouri has been with Salford City since December and is understood to have been recommended to United by owners Paul Scholes and Phil Neville.

His only appearance so far for Salford, a 2-1 win over Kendal Town in the Evo Stick Northern Premier League on January 3, was enough to convince the former United pair that he was worthy of a trial.

El Fitouri was on Manchester City's books as a teenager and was  on professional terms until being released last year.

The 20-year-old right back impressed the coaching staff so much in a match that included the likes of Adnan Januzaj, Darren Fletcher and  Victor Valdes, they are looking to give him another run out soon to see how he fares.

Elsewhere, United striker Will Keane is joining Sheffield Wednesday on loan for the rest of the season while Sunderland were quickly rebuffed in an enquiry to take his team-mate James Wilson on loan last week. 

Gus Poyet was interested prior to getting the go-ahead on Jermain Defoe but Wilson is very much part of Van Gaal's plans.
