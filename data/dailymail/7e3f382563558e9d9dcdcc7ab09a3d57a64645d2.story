It is inevitable that myths will swirl around an event as monumental as the richest fight of all time.

One by one the more extravagant of those fantasies are being debunked.

No, not the enormity of the money.

This is a fortune which just keeps on growing and will carry on doing so all the way to the desert night of May 2 – and beyond as the pay-TV returns pour in.

This is the latest picture Floyd Mayweather posted on shots.com as he trains for the Manny Pacquiao fight

And Pacquiao has also updated his Instagram account with this picture from Monday

Las Vegas was the only realistic option for the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao mega-fight

The $300million fight will be held at the MGM Grand which has hosted Mayweather's last 10 bouts

The latest dose of reality comes from promoter Bob Arum as he explains why, despite all the speculation to the contrary, Floyd Mayweather Jnr vs Manny Pacquiao was never going anywhere except Las Vegas.

Not to New York, the preceding spiritual home of boxing.

Not to the Philippines, where the national adoration of Pacquiao could have generated a second Thrilla in Manilla to follow in the immortal footsteps of Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.

Not to the space odyssey of a stadium which is the new home of the Dallas Cowboys, even though it would have accommodated more than five times the number of spectators lucky and wealthy enough to acquire tickets at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Arum was glibly cited as the proponent of alternative venues.

Not least because he took his PacMan to the house which Cowboys owner Jerry Jones built in Dallas for two fights each of which pulled in 50,000 plus crowds

‘Not me,’ said Arum as soon as Mayweather put pen to contract and he no longer had to muzzle himself for fear of jeopardising what may well become The Half-Billion-Dollar boxing match. 

‘Don’t forget that I live here.

‘All the workers in the entertainment and gaming industries, every restaurant and bar owner and all their waiters, every hotel executive and their employees, all the cab drivers and every maintenance man... they’re all my neighbours.

‘Ask yourselves. Am I going to let them down? Am I going to disappoint or upset the folks next door?

‘That would have made life very difficult for me. But on top of that, this fight truly belongs in Las Vegas.’

That is not just sentiment. Arum is a man who deals in hard economic reality.

He sees the numbers outside the arena – where 16,000 seats priced from $1,500 to $7,500 will treble boxing’s gate record in Nevada to $60 million.

He see past the pay-per-view TV returns which alone could generate upwards of $400 million.

He sees this single event completing the recovery of the place where he lives from the economic recession which at one point threatened the future of the gaming as well as the boxing capital of the world.

Las Vegas has still not managed to attract a US major league sports franchise but Arum says: ‘This fight is three Super Bowls rolled in one.’

He knows it is not only jobs in the short term which the richest fight of all time can secure but the medium term future of the entire city.

Every big name in show business has played the Strip – from Frank Sinatra to Elton John, from Barbra Streisand to Celine Dion.

So too the great names in boxing – from Muhammad Ali to Mike Tyson, from Sugar Ray Robinson to Sugar Ray Leonard,

But Arum says: ‘What we have here now is the biggest event in the history of Las Vegas. There will be a hundred thousand or more visitors. Some with tickets for the fight. Another 30,000 watching on closed circuit screens. Others just for the experience and so they can say they were here that night.

‘Hotel rooms are a thousand bucks a night. With all the high rollers you are looking at a casino drop at the tables of hundreds and hundreds of millions.’

Arum has also scotched the rumour of a re-match clause being secretly inserted into the contract,.

But if Mayweather-Pacquaio lives up to all the hype, none of those high rollers from all over the world will bet against all concerned grasping the chance to make another half-a-billion.

And where might Mayweather-Pacquiao II take place?

What happens in Las Vegas, stays in Las Vegas.

Kell Brook, who thought he was going to die the night he was stabbed in Tenerife, makes what he knows to be nothing short of a miraculous ring comeback in Sheffield on Saturday night.

‘There was blood everywhere and my whole life passed before my eyes,’ he recalls.

These six months after having two muscles and several arteries and tendons severed by a machete, the 28-year-old Brook returns to defending not his very existence but his world welterweight championship.

Brook meets the challenge of Jo Jo Dan for the IBF title he wrested from Shawn Porter with an outstanding away victory on American soil.

This time he has home-town advantage at the Motorpoint Arena.

He should handle this opponent with relative comfort, on his way to a bigger test against either Brandon Rios or Mexican legend Juan Manuel Marquez, victory in which should set up the future pay-per-view Battle of Britain with Amir Khan for which he has been agitating.

Brook vs Dan will be live on Sky Sports 1 from 7.30 pm on Saturday night.
