A business owner begged for his life before he was shot dead in a botched robbery while out walking his dog, police say.

Two 15-year-old boys have been charged with the murder of James Stuhlman, who was killed in Overbrook, Philadelphia at around 8.30pm on March 12.

Police say the married father had pleaded for his life in vain, repeatedly saying the words 'please don't shoot me'. 

Brandon Smith and Tyfine Hamilton - who police say pulled the trigger - have been charged with his murder.

Smith was already in the custody of Philadelphia police, but Hamilton turned himself in early this morning.

A 14-year-old boy has also been arrested on lesser charges and is co-operating with detectives.

Police say the three boys were playing basketball when they decided to rob someone.  

The 51-year-old, the owner of suburban landscaping company, was targeted by the three boys during his nightly walk with his labradoodle named Molly.  

According to police, the trio had initially targeted a different, younger man walking his dog until they saw Mr Stuhlman, whose dog looked 'weak'. 

Homicide Captain James Clark said it appeared the shooting occurred on the 6400 block of Woodcrest Avenue after a brief struggle. 

He told reporters: 'At one point, he did plead for his life.

'He said, 'Please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me,' and they shot still shot him one more time.'

Police added Mr Stuhlman regularly walked his dog at night - and often accompanied by his 13-year-old daughter.

But on the night in question, he had told his daughter it was late and he would go alone. 

Officers found him unresponsive at the scene, with the dog's leash still in his hand, NBC Philadephia reported.

He was taken to Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 

Philadelphia Police Lt. John Walker said: 'The dog was lying next to him -- appeared to be scared and in shock.'
