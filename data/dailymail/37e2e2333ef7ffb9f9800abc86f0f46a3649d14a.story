There was a great deal of optimism when developers began construction on the Al-Waha Shopping Complex but now it lies abandoned and uncompleted, its fountain arid rather than spectacular, host not to shoppers buying the latest must-haves but to refugees from President Assad and the civil war in Syria.

The building lies outside Tripoli in northern Lebanon is now home to more than a thousand residents who pay rent to the building’s owners. They try to make it homely and have hooked up rusty satellite dishes to old television sets. There is a small local shop but not everyone has the money to spend in there.

Families of sometimes more than a dozen members bed down in what should have been an electronics shop or a fashion boutique and try their best to scrape a living to pay their rent.

Not long after the families began moving in, the owners arrived to demand money even there are no real facilities.

The rents are based on where in the shopping arcade the families live – those on the ground floor pay $100 a month while those on the more desirable higher storeys are charged up to $250, according to a video report in CNN.

One resident, Saleh Habib, lives with 12 of his relatives in a single room, sleeping on thin mattresses.

‘The worst part is the boredom,’ he told CNN anchor Hala Gorani. ‘We couldn’t find any place better. A real flat costs at least $500 a month.’

The shopping arcade boasts a rooftop restaurant – Cornelia’s – and a fully equipped gym but none of the residents use it as the owners have locked and bolted its doors.

Speaking later, CNN's Ms Gorani said: 'Refugees tell me that once they’d settled into the mall, stall owners came demanding rent.'

'Families of up to 15 people live together in what should have become clothing or electronics shops. It costs anywhere between $100 and $250 a month to live here. A fortune for many refugee families,' she added.

'Life here unfolds with predictable tedium. Women cook meals, wash laundry and prepare meals. Men try to find work outside the shopping complex, with little success,' Ms Gorani went on to say.

'There is never a moment of privacy or silence, the refugees here say. The circular mall structure acts like a tin drum. After only a few hours, the constant sounds of children playing and people talking become difficult to bear,' she said.

The residents of the Al-Waha arcade in Syria have little to occupy themselves each day. Some of the men leave to look for work while their wives look after the children

There is constant tension outside the arcade where the refugees are accepted and helped by some Lebanese but resented by others who say that their country cannot take what may amount to a million Syrians, nearly a quarter of Lebanon’s entire population.

Fernaz Khattab, 15, lives in the arcade with her mother Rabbab and goes to school in Tripoli. She said life in Al-Waha is ‘not beautiful’ adding, ‘Almost all the people round here hate Syrian people.’

According to locals, government forces launched a heavy air strike on the northern city of Aleppo, Syria, keeping up an aerial offensive that has killed some 2,000 people, including more than 500 children, since January, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
