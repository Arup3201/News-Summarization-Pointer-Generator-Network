Sat in an upholstered armchair, elbows resting upon a desk laden with charts, North Korea's Dear Leader channelled his best Bond villain pose as his military launched two ballistic missiles yesterday.

Flanked by his top officers, Kim Jong Un peered at maps and checked details before two Scud-type missiles were launched high into the sky above the secretive state.

The missiles were fired from the Hwanghae province, in the country's south-west, and flew across the country before landing in the ocean, said an official from the South Korean government, which monitored the launches.

Despite entering into talks to send athletes to compete in this year's Asian Games in South Korea, a move which is seen as a sign of attempted reconciliation, the North has recently test-fired an unusually large number of missiles, artillery and rockets.

South Korean officials have confirmed about 90 such firings by North Korea since February 21. Ten of those have been ballistic-missile launches, according to Seoul's Defence Ministry.

Pyongyang's state media said today that Kim had inspected tactical rocket firing drills, in a likely reference to yesterday's reported ballistic launches.

Kim was quoted as saying that North Korea should be prepared for 'both words and actions'.

Despite the bellicose rhetoric, outside analysts say the North wants to improve ties with South Korea and the U.S. to help lure foreign investment and aid to revive its stagnant economy.

It has asked that the South accept a set of proposals that it said would reduce bilateral tensions, including the cancellation of regular military drills between Seoul and Washington, which are seen as rehearsals for an invasion.

South Korea has rejected the North's proposals, saying it must first demonstrate that it is serious about nuclear disarmament if it truly wants peace.

But the offer to send athletes - and cheerleaders - to the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, in October has been seen as a sign of possible reconciliation.

North Korea boycotted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Summer Olympics, both in Seoul, but attended the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, the 2003 University Games in Daegu and the 2005 Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon.

In all three events, the North dispatched cheering squads, mostly comprising of young women - called an 'army of beauties' in South Korea - which often received more attention than the country's athletes.

The two Koreas remain divided along the world's most heavily fortified border and officially remain in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.
