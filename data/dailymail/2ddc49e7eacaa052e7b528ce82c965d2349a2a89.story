A former policeman who is accused of murdering his third wife has given an extraordinary interview from jail complaining he has been portrayed as 'sinister'.

Drew Peterson, 57, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the killing of Kathleen Savio.

He is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson.

Accused: Drew Peterson, 57, has been imprisoned for the past three years awaiting trial for the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio

The one-time policeman of the year, told a reporter at the Chicago Sun Times: 'I’m sick of being called sinister.'

Instead he insisted he was a romantic and his disastrous track record with women was not his fault - it was because he picked 'women who changed after getting married.'

The ex-cop was brought to national attention when his fourth wife Stacy Peterson disappeared in October 2007.

He was suspected of killing her and disposing of her body, which has never been found.

Authorities then reopened the 
investigation into the March 2004 death of his third wife Kathleen 
Savio, who was initially thought to have drowned accidentally in her 
bathtub.

But it was reclassified as a homicide after her body was exhumed and a medical examiner ruled she drowned following a struggle.

Peterson was arrested and charged with her death in May 2009 and is being held on $20million bail.

During the 30 minute interview in the jail's visitor centre, Peterson 
spoke about his children claiming to be a good father.

He said his sons with Kathleen Savio, Thomas and Kristopher, had never asked him if he had
killed their mother because they knew he had not.

He also said that he told his youngest children, Anthony and Lacy, that their mother Stacy was on vacation.

They are currently being looked after by one of his son's from his first marriage - Peterson has six children from three of his four marriages.

When asked if he missed Stacy he said
he did sometimes, but said if she did reappear the first thing he would
do is 'ask her to sign the divorce papers.'

He
said his last girlfriend Christina Raines has asked him to marry her 
three years ago, but he had not seen her since she had become 
intimidated by the press.

Last year it emerged that Peterson had written a dozen jail-house love letters from jail, repeatedly propositioning a woman he has known since she was 14.

Diana Grandel, now 40, said the former Illinois police sergeant has been plaguing her with bizarre and increasingly sexual requests, like asking for her measurements, photos of her in a bikini as well as describing what he wants to do to her in bed.

He also asked her if she had any sexually transmitted diseases.

In
letters, obtained by the National Enquirer, he wrote to her: 'I just 
think of your smile and holding you in the dark feeling your body 
against mine...I want to spend a lot of time with my lips on yours.

'I like sex with a lot of foreplay, I'm more into pleasing my partner than pleasing others.'

Peterson
spoke to Miss Grandel about the disappearance of his fourth wife, 
sticking to his story that she walked out on him, saying she could have 
all her clothes.

Family: During the interview Peterson claimed he was very close with his two children he had with his third wife, Savio: Thomas and Kristopher

He wrote: 'I have a closet full of new or like-new clothes that Stacy left behind when she abandoned us, everything from formal dresses to sweats to bikinis.

'If you want these things let me know, only you should know.'

Miss Grandel told the Enquirer that she now believes Peterson may be guilty of murdering his ex-wife.

She said: 'That's when I realised that Drew had probably killed Stacy. I kept thinking that Stacy would have taken her clothes if she had just run away.'

The 40-year-old met Peterson when she was 14 and he was a young policeman.

He rescued her and her family from an abusive father and she said she admired him for it.

She wrote to him in jail to show her support following his arrest but he quickly turned lecherous.

Miss Grandel said: 'I have a boyfriend and Peterson is coming on to me, while he's in jail! I think he's a creep now, and a murderer.'

Peterson has served the vast majority of his sentence in solitary confinement and his only human contact is with guards who bring him his meals.

Jury selection in his trial begins July 23.
