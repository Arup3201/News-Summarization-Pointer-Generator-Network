Essendon players face the prospect of suspensions after the AFL club lost its court battle with Australia's anti-doping authority over its supplements program.

Justice John Middleton took just 30 minutes to deliver the finding in the Federal Court on Friday.   

He ruled the  nature of the investigation by ASADA and the AFL was legal, meaning current and past players may now face suspensions as a result.

AFL Essendon coach James Hird and the Essendon Football Club has had its case against the ASADA anti-doping agency dismissed

The sidelined coach was present at Friday's ruling in the Federal Court handed down by  Justice John Middleton

Middleton found that ASADA's investigation into Essendon's 2012 supplement's program was legal

The club has until October 1 to appeal the findings and have been ordered to  pay ASADA's court costs. 

Justice Middleton said ASADA complied with the rule of law in establishing and conducting the investigation. 

'In my view, ASADA complied with the rule of law in establishing and conducting, in the manner and for the purposes it did, the investigation.  

Justice Middleton said coach James Hird and players would have been aware that the interviews they were giving would be used by ASADA.

'In addition, ASADA lawfully provided the Interim Report to the AFL, which has subsequently been acted upon by the AFL in bringing disciplinary charges against Essendon and Mr Hird.' 

Middleton dismissed Essendon and coach Hird's claim that the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority had conducted an illegal investigation into its 2012 supplements program.

He said, in his view, ASADA complied with the 'rule of law' in establishing and conducting its investigation.  

The ruling means the show cause notices issued to 34 past and present Essendon players alleging doping offences stand.

Justice Middleton argued the anti-doping agency's interim report against Hird and club officials was a fair report.

He said ASADA acted for a proper purpose in providing the report to the AFL in its bit to pursue disciplinary action against the club and its officials, including Hird.

'On the evidence before the court, the investigation disclosed a strong link between deficient governance and management practices at Essendon and the possibility of Essendon players being involved in anti-doping violations.'

'The poor governance and management practices at Essendon were related to possible anti- doping violations by Essendon players, to the extent that such violations may have been systematic, or may have occurred because proper governance and management practices were not in place.

'This seems to have been the very situation that existed at Essendon.' 

Justice Middleton referred to former ASADA CEO Aurora Andruska, who oversaw the supplements investigation, as a 'truthful witness' who 'provided convincing and credible explanations for the steps she or her investigators took.'

'There is no pleaded case alleged by either Essendon or Mr Hird that Ms Andruska as CEO improperly delegated any of her functions or powers, or in any other way abrogated her responsibilities,' he said.

He also did not accept evidence that James Hird was threatened and pressured into accepting responsibility for the AFL club's supplements program.

'The 34 Players and Mr Hird had agreed to subject themselves to compulsory interviews,' he said. 

Essendon and Hird have 21 days in which to lodge an appeal
