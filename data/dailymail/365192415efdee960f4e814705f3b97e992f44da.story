A high school wrestler who lost the state wrestling championship won over the crowd, when instead of getting upset he hugged his opponent's father, who has terminal cancer.

Blaine High School sophomore Malik Stewart from Minnesota lost the 120-pound title match in the Class 3A wrestling tournament to opponent Mitchell McKee, when McKee pinned him in the final face-off match that was seen on NorthMetroTV.

McKee said: 'It was a big match for him and to be able to hug my dad like that and 
not be mad and storm off like a lot of kids do. It was really 
respectful.'

McKee, a St. Michael Albertville High 
School sophomore said that he wanted to win the tournament for his 
father Steve, who is dying from cancer.

He said: 'I prayed 'God help me win this match' so I can go win a state title for my dad.'

Stewart, who lost his own father to a heart attack when he was 7, said he was 'just doing the right thing.'

'He was pretty proud, and his dad was pretty proud, so I went over there an I shook his hand.

'I embraced him a little bit, and told him to stay strong and that everybody loves him.

'I got a little teary because I lost the match, and I knew the hard times he was going through.'

After he McKee's father, the crowd at the Xcel Energy Centre in St Paul erupted, applauding and giving Stewart a standing ovation, with many tearing up at the scene.

When it was McKee's turn to hug his father, the reaction from the crowd was just as heartfelt.

Stewart said: 'The crowd went wild and I heard a couple people say after I did it - 
that was pretty classy - but I just did it straight from the heart.

Josh Prokosch, Blaine's head wrestling coach, said Stewart took it upon himself to congratulate McKee's dad.

Prokosch said: 'You see kids, they lose and throw their headgear, they sit and pout, first thoughts through his mind, are to congratulate Mitchell, congratulate the coach and shake the dad's hand so that was fantastic.

'For a sophomore in high school he can see a lot of the big picture which is pretty rare nowadays.

Stewart will eventually face McKee again, and said he is focused on his goal of winning two state titles.Â 

He said: 'When you go out there, you want to win, but if you don't win, you have got to be a good sport and you be polite.

'That's the biggest part.'

T.J. Anderson, Assistant Wrestling Coach for Dassel-Cokato Middle School, said in a letter to the Anoka Hennepin School District: 'The whole crowd gave a standing ovation, not just for the STMA wrestler 
and his father, but for Stewart, who understands what true sportsmanship
 is.

'Thank you for making your athletes into what they are today, Mr. 
Stewart is a model wrestler that we can all use in our examples of what a
 true athlete is.'
