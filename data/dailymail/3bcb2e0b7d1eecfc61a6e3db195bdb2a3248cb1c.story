The owners of two American Pit Bull Terriers that bit off a six-year-old girl's ear in a vicious attack were fined just £80 each.

Ellie May Hall was savaged by the dogs as she played on her scooter in her back garden - just yards from her home in Ashington, Northumberland.

One of the animals started biting her head and neck while the other sank its teeth into her torso and legs. The schoolgirl suffered multiple injuries and part of her ear was bitten off.

She was also left with a hole in her arm and bite marks to her thighs, and needed a two-and-a-half hour operation, skin grafts and 11 stitches in her head. 

Mother and daughter, Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and Stacey Mielnik, 20, admitted being the owners of dogs which caused injury while dangerously out of control in a public place. 

The women walked free from Newcastle Crown Court last week after a judge imposed three-month suspended prison sentences, and £80 fines. The dogs were destroyed after the attack.

Today Ellie's family have dismissed their punishment, describing the sentence as 'an absolute joke'.

Ellie, who turned seven in November, was playing in her back garden around 3pm on May 4, when the two American Pit Bulls approached her.

The girl believed the dogs were friendly when they came up to the garden and started sniffing, after smelling the scent of Ellie's dog. The pit bulls then suddenly began to savagely maul the child.

Elizabeth Mitchell, 43, and daughter Stacey Mielnik, 20, were given a suspended three month prison sentence at Newcastle Crown Court last week. Ellie's parents have today branded their sentences 'an absolute joke'

The attack was only brought to a halt when a neighbour chased away the dogs with a crowbar.

Ellie's parents have now spoken of their disgust, claiming the owners should have been banned from keeping dogs, ordered to do community service and to pay compensation. 

The Halls worry the court's failure to impose a ban could see another child injured.

Ellie's mother Tina, 31, who also has a 10-year-old daughter, Chloe, said: 'They should have been made to do community service at least.

'They could go out and buy a dog now. We have got no justice. I cannot understand why we went to crown court and for that.'

Her father Richie, a 33-year-old builder who was in court with his wife for the sentencing last month, added: 'Our biggest fear is it could happen again. It is a million to one chance; we were really unlucky.

'But it could happen again. That is on the judge's head, and the legal system. It is an absolute joke.

'They have had an £80 fine that everybody gets. They have walked away Scot free. The amount of sleepless nights we have had it is unreal. 

'It is not a sentence, it is a waste of time. It is a joke, we are gutted.'

Ellie, a pupil at Central Primary School, was playing with a friend at around 3pm on May 4 when the dogs attacked.

Jason Charlton, who was working with a crowbar nearby, and two others saved Ellie when they fought off the dogs. 

The American Pit Bull Terrier is banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 which prohibits the ownership of animals bred for their fighting abilities.

Last month, the court heard that Mr Charlton heard a child's screams. 'He thought it was a dog fight then he heard a child screaming and crying,' said Prosecutor Emma Dowling.

'He opened his back gate and could see a small child on her knees facing into the rear gate. 

'She had her hands on her head to protect herself and both dogs were attacking her, one towards the neck and head and the other on her torso.

'He had a crowbar in his hand and chased the dogs away but he said the dogs returned.'

Mr Charlton said he was worried for his own safety because both dogs appeared extremely vicious.

In a statement to the court, he said: 'It was a horrific and terrifying incident. I'm positive if I did not come out when I did the dogs would have continued to attack Ellie.

'It was clear she had sustained substantial injuries.'

The court heard both dogs were at the home of Mitchell when Mielnik arrived at the house, coming in through the back gate.

Miss Dowling said: 'That gate does have bolts but they are not used by the family routinely.

'On this day they must have been left closed but not bolted or not closed properly because both dogs escaped from the rear yard into the rear lane.'

The attack continues to cause Ellie and her parents ongoing problems physically and mentally.

Miss Dowling said: 'She has suffered significant psychological effects and struggles to sleep.

'She is now extremely frightened of dogs and her family have had to get rid of their own dog because Ellie was petrified at what might happen.

Recorder Anton Lodge QC said he hoped the community would not continue to 'behave unpleasantly' towards the mother and daughter when he sentenced them at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) last week

'She struggles to visit her grandparents because they have neighbours with dogs either side so phone calls have to be made before they visit to make sure the dogs are in the house.

'Her parents have also been affected significantly and are worried about the effect this has had on Ellie. This has had a lasting effect on the family as a whole.' 

Mitchell, 43, and Mielnik, 20, consented to the dogs being destroyed after the attack.

The Dangerous Dogs Act was introduced in 1991 as a means of keeping vulnerable people and children safe from animals. 

Prohibited breeds are so because they have been bred for their abilities to fight. 

Among them  is the pit bull terrier, the Japanese tosa, and any other considered by the Secretary of State to have been bred for fighting.

Banned breeds cannot be kept, bred, sold or exchanged under the law.  Anyone who owns a banned breed cannot take it out in public without a muzzle. 

If a person commits an Dangerous Dogs related offence, they can be disqualified for dog ownership and be ordered to have the animal put down.  

The court heard the pair have suffered threats in their local community and have had their windows smashed and been forced to move as a result of the incident.

Mark Styles, for Mitchell, said: 'She has been a dog owner for 30 years and is devastated and truly horrified at what happened to Ellie, it has turned her life upside down.

'She is a new mother and has been subjected to harassment in the local area and has been forced to move home twice and her windows have been put out.'

Richard Bloomfield, for Mielnik, said: 'The dogs had given no prior indication of behaving in this way, it was an attack out of the blue.

'What she did wrong is to fail to take proper precautions to make sure the gate was secure, not realising the gravity of the consequences that afternoon when they got loose.

'She is distraught and deeply remorseful. She lives alone with her daughter and has suffered abuse from the local community.'

Recorder Anton Lodge QC sentenced both Mitchell and Mielnik to three month suspended prison sentence.

'The community should realise the punishment for what you have done is reserved to the courts, which are publicly seen and overlooked,' said the recorder.

'I hope the community will not continue to behave in an unpleasant way towards either of you.'
