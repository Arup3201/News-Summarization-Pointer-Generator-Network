The Gredos mountains situated between the Avila, Caceres and Salamanca provinces in Castille, central Spain, are something of a secret. Certainly none of my friends have heard of this lovely spot, crossed by the Duero and Tajo rivers, and only two hours west of Madrid.

‘What people do not realise about Gredos,’ says Maria Elena Dendaluce, who runs her own horse riding company here, with sparky energy, ‘is that this is not typical Castille — not flatlands.’

It is a place with open landscape, snow-capped mountains and a special quality to the light.

Pastoral perfection: The Sierra de Gredos is one of Spain's less known, and yet most beautiful, areas

I’m staying in Spain’s first Parador, as a base for a three-day riding trip and general explore. It is a  comfortable hunting lodge, built in 1928, in Castilian granite, by King Alfonso XIII.

It still attracts well-heeled Spanish hunters who are allowed to shoot Ibex in the mountains. And it was in this hotel that the post-Franco government drew up the Spanish constitution.

What overwhelms me about Gredos is the peace. I once read an article claiming yellow helps lift depression. If that’s true, then Gredos must trump Prozac. Yellow broom gilds the mountains (there are 12 different varieties). And, at Easter, villagers even decorate their houses with the stuff.

In the saddle: The rivers and bridges of the Sierra de Gredos make the perfect setting for equine adventure

Gredos is a
 destination for road cyclists, mountaineers, para gliders, 
bird-watchers and astronomers (it has recently secured ‘dark sky’ status
 for its unpolluted atmosphere). It is also ideal for active families as
 well as those who like to do nada.

And, it is perfection for horse riders.

Before saddling up, I walk beside the Tormes river. There were glaciers here 12,000 years ago, and today, wild flowers abound: asphodel, white heather and crimson orchids.

I’m with Juan Francisco Redondo Sanchez, a botanist who knows his mushrooms - of which Gredos boasts 350 varieties. In autumn, you can pick them by the kilo.

The sun shines on Equiberia’s stables and its well-schooled horses (Andalucians, Arabs, crosses).

The rides are for ‘experienced but not necessarily expert’ riders, and I’m delighted with Arturo, my Andalucian bay -  the equivalent of a handsome bachelor who dines out often.

Tucking in: Even the horses join in with the holiday spirit

Most rides last a week and go through pine forests, cross the Tormes and stop at Barbellido gorge with its 14th-century bridge (some of us brave a swim).

When the horses push through the broom, the sweet scent of vanilla is released. Nothing is more calming than listening as we ride: cow-bells, the size of small saucepans, sound like someone doing gentle washing up, leather saddles creak and the ‘ssshh’ of flowing water is soporific.

You ride for five hours a day with aperitif stops. A table with a white cloth is laid with almonds, cherries, cured hams and local wine - all this before an excellent lunch.

On the last day, an exhilarating gallop ends beside Laguna Canada del Gallo, surrounded by snow-capped mountains. We feel we have dismounted in paradise and the sublime picnic that materialises out of Roberto Garcia’s black van proves it.
