A reality program detailing the hijinks of the Busbice brothers - who run a hunting supply company in Louisiana and have ties to the Robertsons from A & E's hit series 'Duck Dynasty' - will air  on the same network.

Brothers Matt and Ryan Busbice work at Wildgame Innovations together and will appear on the new show 'Country Buck$.'

Their father Bill Busbice, mother Beth Busbice, uncle Hard Luck, as well as ranch manager T-Carr will also be included as show cast members, according to the network's website.

Both Ryan Busbice and his younger brother Matt revealed how both Wildlife Innovations and their new reality show came about in a Tuesday appearance on 'Fox and Friends.'

Matt Busbice said on the program that his older brother 'took something out the oven, looked like a Rice Krispie treat, but it was a protein deer feed block and that's how we got started making hunting products. And now we pretty much make everything for hunting and fishing.'

Speaking about the reality show, Ryan Bustice said 'They came, they heard about how we test our products and all our R and D, and they were fascinated with that. And we thought it would be a great way to promote our brands and show everybody how we do this.'

Matt Busbice also addressed his family's friendship and supposed rivalry with the Robertson clan of 'Duck Dynasty' fame in an interview with Fox411.

'We feel like it's not us verse them,' he told the news outlet. 'WE feel like we're a companionship. Willie loves to give me advice. We have spent so much time over the few years now that he sees his little stepbrother about to come out with a show he has just prepared me with some of the best advice.

'The Robertson family has been a blessing to be a part of our lives. Willie has really become a great friend of ours and a hairy stepbrother.'

Busbice also revealed to the news outlet what he sees as the difference between the two reality shows, saying 'We know everybody's going to say, "Oh, they're just like Duck Dynasty.'" The main difference is that we really are a completely different business. We sell everything for hunting. Our show is more focused on showing what we make.

He continued '[We do have] a crazy uncle [like Uncle Si]. He's the living breathing Uncle Eddie from 'Christmas Vacation.' [Also,] I think that faith is important to us as but I don't know if you'll see it as much in the show as they portray [on 'Duck Dynasty'].' 

Regarding Wildlife Innovations products, Busbice told Fox 411 'We make everything now from archery weapons to range finders to metal detectors to deer feed to deer calls and duck calls. It's funny, our crossbow is on the poster of the new "Hunger Games" movie. That's what handsome [Liam] Hemsworth is holding.' 

According to A & E's website, Matt Busbice handles Wildlife Innovations' marketing and television advertising, while Ryan Busbice serves as General Manager.

Wildlife Innovations goods go through testing on 55,000 acres belonging to their timber company-running father Bill Busbice in Louisiana, the website says.

Bill Bustice and his two sons previously appeared in a reality show program on the Outdoor Channel, called 'Wildgame Nation.'

The series premiere for 'Country Buck$' will air Wednesday at 10pm.
