Dangerous drugs circulating in the Essex area are said to be connected to the death of a 19-year-old man.

The 19-year-old died at a flat in 
Witham, Essex after taking some of the 'crudely-produced' drugs from the
LSD family, known as 2CE.

Two other men thought to have taken the drug became ill during the incident but recovered after hospital treatment.

Detectives today warned there may be dangerous drugs in circulation after the death of a man who apparently took some.

The 19-year-old man, from the Braintree area, was found to have died at the scene by the ambulance service.

Another man, 18, from Braintree and a man, 21, from Witham were taken by ambulance to Broomfield Hospital, Chelmsford.

A police spokesman said: 'Detectives suspect the drugs are from a crudely-produced batch which has proved to be fatal.

'A forensic post-mortem examination will be held later today and toxicology tests will be carried out to establish how the teenager died.'

Detective Chief Inspector Anne Cameron said: 'We believe that one person has died and two others were taken ill because they have taken a drug that was poorly-produced by criminals who have no regard for the lives of their customers.

'Anyone with information about these drugs or anyone with any information about the death should contact us urgently.'

The spokesman added: 'Detectives would like to make the public aware of the danger that there may be other similar drugs in circulation.

'The drug has the physical appearance of a white crystal powder (similar to sugar) and has a hallucinogenic type of effect.

'The drug can be taken orally or ingested nasally. Anyone who may be in possession of this type of drug should stop using it with immediate effect.'

Two 19-year-old men from Braintree and a 21-year-old man from Witham have been arrested in connection with the investigation.
