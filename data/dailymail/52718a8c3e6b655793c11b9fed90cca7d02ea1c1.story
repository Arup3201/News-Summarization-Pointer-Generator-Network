Arsenal have thrown their support behind Save the Children's Christmas Jumper Day, with several of their star players posing in festive knitwear.

Players including Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla, Laurent Koscielny and Kieran Gibbs donned Arsenal's snowman-themed jumper.

Arsenal Ladies players including Kelly Smith, Rachel Yankey and Danielle Carter were also involved.

Save the Children's Christmas Jumper Day takes place this Friday, December 12, encouraging people to wear Christmas jumpers and donate £2 to the charity.

Sanchez also posed in an oversized Christmas pudding design in the club's home colours and the players juggled a woollen football, while Cazorla struggled to get to grips with a giant pair of knitting needles. 

The rest of Arsenal's first team squad have travelled to Turkey where they will face Galatsaray in their final Champions League group match.

For Arsene Wenger's side to finish top of their group they must beat the Istanbul-based giants and hope Jurgen Klopp's Dortmund lose against Anderlecht in Germany.

The entire Arsenal Ladies squad gather while sporting an array of festive accessories
