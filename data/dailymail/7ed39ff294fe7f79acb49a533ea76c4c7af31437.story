Four years ago, when the British Olympic medallists flew back from China, they went business class.

Gymnast Beth Tweddle was in economy after missing bronze by a whisker and the memory spurred her on to success yesterday.

The popular 27-year-old won bronze after a breathtaking routine on the uneven bars, marred only by a stumble on her dismount.

But in her last Olympics, Tweddle was delighted to make the podium – 20 years after her first gym class in Crewe.

Tweddle, who is old in a sport packed
with teenagers, has endured no fewer than ten operations as years of 
competing punished her body to its breaking point. She has had three 
operations on her shoulders and seven on her feet, while her left ankle 
is held together with a mass of surgical pins.

Five months ago, further disaster 
struck – a knee injury requiring keyhole surgery which nearly put paid 
to her dream of competing at London 2012.

But in a testament to her remarkable 
character, Tweddle refused to give up. She hobbled out of the procedure 
on a Friday and was back in rehab on Monday.

Agony: The stumble that cost Beth Tweddle the gold medal

The medal comes despite having knee surgery just 12 weeks ago

Tweddle Cheshire, has been an ambassador for the sport in Britain for many years, having won more titles and medals than any other British gymnast

The London 2012 Games are the last ones that Tweddle will compete in

Every day, she worked from 9am to 6pm
to strengthen her joint, while at night she slept with a £3,500 ice 
machine strapped to her left knee to stop the swelling.

‘If you ask Beth to describe herself 
in one word, that word would be stubborn,’ said her father, Jerry, who 
runs a successful plastics company. ‘She doesn’t do giving up.’

Her mother Ann, who works on a 
literacy programme, added: ‘When she got that injury, I thought that was
it. I was worried about it, but Beth just carried on. I’ll never know 
how she slept with that ice around her leg – she said she just got used 
to it.’

Within weeks of her surgery, she was declared fit to compete.

‘This is the best feeling in the 
world,’ Tweddle, from Liverpool, said yesterday. ‘All I wanted was to 
finish my career with an Olympic medal in my pocket – it didn’t matter 
what colour.’

Tweddle came just 0.025 points from a medal at the Beijing Games and thought about retiring from the sport then

The cheer from the crowd at the O2 arena for Tweddle was no different to that of many Team GB gold medal winners

The delighted gymnast wiped away 
tears of joy after seeing her score. She had dazzled the judges with a 
complex and high-risk routine that drew gasps from the audience. There 
were roars from the crowd as she finished the performance, which 
included the special hand-crossing move which she invented and which has
officially been named ‘the Tweddle’ by the International Gymnastics 
Federation.

‘There was one moment today where I 
thought it was going to be exactly like Beijing,’ she admitted. ‘But 
luckily this time I had done enough.’

And as she stood on the podium, she 
beamed at her proud father as he recorded on video the medal moment the 
family had waited two decades to see.

Tweddle, who grew up in Bunbury, 
Cheshire, discovered her love of gymnastics when she was seven. After 
doing her A-levels at the £3,500-a-term Queen’s School in Cheshire, she 
threw herself fully into her training.

She met coach Amanda Reddin when she was 12, and has stayed with her.

Now, as Britain’s most decorated gymnast, she holds three world, six European and seven British titles, and is an MBE.

She has deferred a physiotherapy 
degree until next year so she can spend some time with family and 
friends, not least boyfriend Steve Cryer, 30.

When asked about the future, Tweddle 
said: ‘I definitely won’t be back for Rio. My body can’t take it and I 
don’t think my coach can either.’
