It was the launchpad for the Beatles' unprecedented musical career, demolished in 1973 only to spring up again next door as a working venue once more.

But now the Cavern Club in Liverpool, a famous haunt where the Fab Four played nearly 300 times, is up for sale.

The club forms part of the Cavern Walks Shopping Centre in the centre of the city, which has been put on the market with a guide price of £1million for the whole centre.

History: The Cavern was the club where the Beatles made their name - here (from left to right) George Harrison, Paul McCartney and John Lennon can be seen playing their final gig at the venue

Leathers: The club also played host to the band's earlier look, featuring leather jackets. In those days the band had yet to recruit Ringo Starr, and had Pete Best on drums instead

Trendy: The Cavern, as pictured here before demolition, was a central part of the Liverpool music scene

Although the business which runs the venue will not be affected, as its lease extends to 2028, the owners of the property will change with the sale.

It has been offered by owners Warner Estate, who filed for administration in August, The Times reported.

The club was frequented by the Fab Four in the early 1960s, before they shot to international fame.

In the beginning the venue would pay them just £3, 15 shillings per gig. They played there mainly with drummer Pete best, as Ringo Starr had yet to join the band.

It was not a licensed venue, so sold soft drinks and food while acts were playing, and was popular with teenagers.

The early gigs also played host to a very different band than the one which would come to dominate pop music.

Continuation: The club is still a thriving venue

Legacy: A famous feature of the cavern is a wall with names of all the bands who played there written on it. Sir Paul McCartney is pictured here in front of in in 1999

In those days the boys wore leather jackets and blue jeans - which almost got George Harrison kicked out of the club for breaching the dress code.

The would also swear, smoke and eat on stage, and sometimes stop mid-song - in stark contrast to the slick and clean image that later propelled them to stardom.

John Lennon later said of the years playing the club: 'In those old Cavern days, half the 
thing was just ad lib, what you’d call comedy. We just used to mess 
about, jump into the audience, do anything.'

Trendy: The club was a mainstay of the Liverpool social circuit in the '60s

Dancing: The underground club was often full of revellers listening to the latest hits

As well as being an early stomping ground where the band would hone their performance, the club was also where the band were discovered by manager Brian Epstein, who managed their ascent and helped develop their signature style.

The club as it stood in the 60s was eventually demolished in 1973 to make way for a railway development, but was re-founded in the 1980s on almost the exact same site with many of the original bricks.

The club which helped foster The Beatles' career also played host to other classic acts in the 1960s and 1970s, including the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, The Kinks and The Who.

But the underground club was forced to close in 1973 to make way for a rail development.

The site was left dormant until it was bought in the early 1980s for redevelopment.

Liverpool football player Tommy Smith, along a business partner, signed the new lease on the club and opened in in April 1984 - the same time the Cavern Walks shopping centre opened.

The new club, built deeper underground than the original, occupies 75 per cent of the original site, and was rebuilt using 15,000 bricks saved from the demolition.

The club closed due to financial pressures in 1989, but was reopened in 1991 by Dave Jones and Bill Heckle, who have run the club for the past 22 years and ensured live music plays most nights.

Today's pop royalty have picked up the baton of performing there - acts including Adele, Jessie J and The Wanted have played there in recent years.
