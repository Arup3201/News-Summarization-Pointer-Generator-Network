An eccentric aristocrat eco-activist has broken into a GM research institute in a bid to destroy controversial field trials on genetically modified wheat.

Hector Christie, 50, son of the founder of the Glyndebourne opera, is said to have caused ‘significant damage’ during the raid in the early hours of Sunday.

The Old Etonian inherited the 6,000-acre Tapeley Park estate in Devon and featured in the Channel 4 series Country House Rescue last year.

He has a long history of protest and was once arrested in Germany dressed as a potato.

The target of Sunday’s break-in was the controversial GM wheat trial at the  Rothamsted Research centre in Harpenden, Hertfordshire.

The wheat has been modified to emit chemical signals to drive away aphids, which the institute claims will allow farmers to use fewer chemical pesticides.

However, consumers are sceptical of the benefits of such crops and as a result there is no demand for GM wheat in Britain.

Protest group Take The Flour Back has been set up to challenge the trial.

They are concerned that pollen from the GM wheat will spread to contaminate grasslands in the area.

However, it appears that Christie mounted his own protest by breaking into the laboratories.

In a statement Rothamsted said the protester caused ‘significant, random property damage but failed in his attempt to disrupt the experiment’.

Director Maurice Moloney described the break-in as an ‘act of vandalism’ and said the ‘illegal activity’ had taken place despite efforts to hold talks with protesters in the hope of allowing the trials to run their course.

Eleanor Baylis, a Take The Flour Back spokesman, said they ‘had no information’ about the break-in but said the group was ‘relieved if the quantity of GM pollen released from the trial has been reduced’. 

Christie is due to appear in court on July 13.
