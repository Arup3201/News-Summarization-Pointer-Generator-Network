An auction house has provoked fury in the Jewish community after it sold Nazi memorabilia on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.

J.P. Humbert Auctioneers sold flags emblazoned with swastikas and Hitler Youth armbands on September 25, as Jews observed Yom Kippur.

The Northamptonshire auction house has since admitted the timing of the sale was 'unfortunate' and tried to donate an undisclosed amount to a Holocaust charity, which refused the offer.

Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert (seen right), admitted the timing of the sale had been 'unfortunate'

The Holocaust Educational Trust refused the donation on the grounds they don’t take money from the sale of items associated with the Nazi regime.

A spokesperson for the charity said: 'The Holocaust Educational Trust will not accept any donations from organisations which profit from the sale of items associated with the Nazi regime.

'It is our view that these items are best placed in archives, museums or in an educational context.'

Mr Humbert defended the auction house, based in Towcester, Northants, and said yesterday: 'Not being Jewish, how am I expected to know the dates of Jewish festivals?

'The sum we offered was not the proceeds of any specific sale, it would have been a bona fide ex-gratia donation.

'They refused it because it was against their policy.'

'It's not my place to make moral judgements': Items going under the hammer included Hitler Youth armbands and an SS bayonet

The sale included a wide range of 
Nazi memorabilia, including an SS bayonet, Hitler Youth armbands, a 
range of swastika flags and SS crockery.

Recent
 collections of Nazi photos, cutlery from the Buchenwald concentration 
camp and cuffs belonging to the Totenkopf, an SS division originally 
formed from concentration camp guards, were also included in the sale.

Although
 against the law in some European countries, including France and 
Germany, the sale of Nazi memorabilia is legal in the UK.

Mr
 Humbert added: 'If the law changes we will abide by it to the letter. 
But we do not actively court Nazi items and it is not for me to make a 
moral judgement.

Jonathan Humbert defended the auction house in Towcester, Northamptonshire, which he said handles items 'sensitively and sensibly'

'We’ve
 sold a sofa and other things associated with Winston Churchill and he 
ordered the bombing of Dresden where tens of thousands of people died, 
yet we didn’t have people saying those sales were disgusting.

'We do handle items sensitively and sensibly, and in no way do we wish to glorify the Nazi regime.

'This
 time, I have turned away items that I do not wish to be associated 
with: namely a cosh used at Bergen Belsen and a book entitled ‘Covenant 
with Death’ with horrific photos.

'As
 an auctioneer, it is not my place to make moral judgements, but part of
 what we do is to keep alive the worst element in human nature.

'If you keep these things alive in people’s consciousness - and don’t bury them - we can hope the terrible things will never happen again. 'No one is glorifying the SS or the Holocaust - far from it.'

Yom Kippur, also known as the Day of Atonement, is the holiest day of the year for Jewish people, and is traditionally marked with fasting and prayer.
