A 14-year-old girl and her new stepfather have been found safe four days after she ran away and he chased after her - but never returned.

Authorities are now trying to determine what happened when Evelyn Carrillo vanished from her Willis, Texas home on Sunday, closely followed by her 40-year-old stepfather, Edgar Soto, and where they have been since.

A spokesperson for the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office told MailOnline on Thursday afternoon that the pair had been found safe in the local area after following up on tips.

Found: Evelyn Carrillo, 14, and her 40-year-old stepfather Edgar Soto (both pictured) went missing on Sunday. They were both found on Thursday and authorities are working to find out what happened

Soto was 
located first and then Evelyn was found in a different location later on
 Thursday - 'but that's not to say they weren't together before', Lieutenant Brady Fitzgerald said.

Both
 Evelyn and her stepfather are speaking with authorities to determine 
what happened after they vanished on Sunday.

Speaking to KHOU11
 before they were found, Evelyn's mother, Mary Hernandez Soto, had pleaded for help finding her
 daughter. She said Evelyn had run 
away after become distressed when Soto was leaving for work as a truck 
driver.

'"Daddy
 don't go, don't go, you don't 
spend time with us, you're always working",' her mother recalled the 
girl saying. '"He's going to leave, I already know he's going
 to leave, I'll just leave". So she stormed off, ran off.'

Safe: Evelyn reportedly ran away because she was upset that her stepfather was about to leave for work

After the teenager fled, both of her parents took chase - first on foot and then in a car - before deciding to split up to look for the girl, her mother said.

Hernandez Soto searched for hours but came up with nothing - and soon her husband was missing too.

'I'm texting and calling, no answer, and I'm like where is he at? Now I'm looking for her, looking for the truck,' she told KHOU. 'I have a feeling he has her. I have a feeling that he probably found her on Sunday.'

When 
friends took missing persons posters to a nearby McDonald's, an employee
 said she thought she saw the girl with a man - but a manager said they 
had not found the pair on security footage.

Search: Authorities in Montgomery County, Texas launched a search for the pair, who have now been found

Before the pair were found, Lt. Fitzgerald said the mother had reported her daughter missing on Sunday, and that investigators were following up on tips as to her whereabouts.

But he said authorities did not believe she was in danger.

Hernandez Soto said she refused to leave the house in case her daughter returned

'I don't think he would ever hurt her,' she said. 'But I don't know what's going on... I need Evelyn home. That's my child. I don't function well without Evelyn.'

There is no word on whether the mother has been reunited with her mother yet.
