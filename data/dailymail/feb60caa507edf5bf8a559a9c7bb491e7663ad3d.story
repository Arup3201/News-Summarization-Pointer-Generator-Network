This was a walkover, a day Reading undermined the race for Premier League promotion in a bid to reach Wembley.

Steve Clarke's decision to make nine changes is surely down to the ridiculous scheduling of Monday’s FA Cup quarter-final replay against Bradford, but some of his Championship counterparts might not be impressed.

Young Reading were picked off by Watford. That’s not the fault of Clarke, the blame lying squarely with wretched broadcasting rules which deem domestic cup games cannot be played on the same night as Champions League fixtures.

But other managers, particularly Mark Warburton and Steve McClaren - whose sides both dropped points - may talk of a duty of care to the league, even if Reading can do nothing but finish mid-table themselves. The average squad number of the visitors here was 26, a statistic to tell all.

Clarke is set to name a completely fresh XI tomorrow night and was understandably prickly when asked about the changes.

‘What ramifications? I can’t think for the life of me why there would be any ramifications - I’m not concerned whatsoever,’ he said. I’m allowed to pick from my squad, so I’ll pick from my squad. I don’t understand.’

Fifty-two seconds is all it took the hosts, Troy Deeney popping a neat ball into Almen Abdi, who stroked beyond Mikkel Anderson with the outside of his boot. Marco Motta’s stunning 30-yard half-volley cannoned off the bar six minutes later.

Anderson then made an acrobatic save from early substitute Fernando Forestieri’s overhead kick, and this was put beyond doubt when Matej Vydra slipped his man and lifted into the net with ease before half-time.

Just after the break Forestieri darted round his man at the byline, allowing Deeney to get in on the act, tapping home from inside the six-yard box.

‘I’ve got to be happy today,’ Hornets boss Slavisa Jokanovic said. ‘Reading have an important game in front of them - I expected changes.’

To their credit, Clarke’s side improved and he will leave Vicarage Road with some sense of satisfaction after Jem Karacan - making just his second appearance since September 2013 because of persistent knee problems - bent a classy consolation on his comeback.

But Forestieri was to slam in a fourth late on, banging the club mascot’s drum in celebration. Back in the top two, more and more are banging the Premier League drum around these parts.
