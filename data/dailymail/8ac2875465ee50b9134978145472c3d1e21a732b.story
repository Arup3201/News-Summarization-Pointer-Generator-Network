This is the moment the president and COO of discount chain Family Dollar is fired during an episode of television show ‘Undercover Boss.’

Michael Bloom was fired by a warehouse supervisor because he was unable to safely operate a forklift.

Rosali, a supervisor and forklift operator in a Virginia warehouse, fired a man he thought was named Mark.

'Mark,' as Mr Bloom was called, told Family Dollar employees he was on a reality show competing for his own business.

Forklift operator was one of a handful of jobs ‘Mark’ undertook within the company while on the CBS show.

He made multiple mistakes with the forklift that put multiple people in danger.

From blowing through stop signals to ignoring other safeguards, ‘Mark’ was a terrible forklift operator.

‘Mark, I gotta tell you this,’ Rosali said to the covert COO. ‘I wouldn’t be comfortable leaving you alone doing this.’

‘I will have to, you know, let you go,’ he continued.

Woah, easy!: 'Mark' clumsily operates the forklift, causing Rosali to tell him to be more gentle

Stop signs are not suggestive: 'Mark' also blew through a stop sign - a big no no

The astonished exec was almost speechless being fired for a low-level position from the company he runs on national television.

‘Just for that… I get fired for one little mistake,’ said ‘Mark.’

‘Yeah,’ Rosali confirmed.

Rosali further defended his decision in a follow up interview added to the broadcast.

‘I have to fire Mark for safety reasons,’ he said. ‘I don’t want him to have an accident or hurt anybody else.’

A stern warning: 'Mark' was only at the controls a few minutes before receiving his first warning

If only he knew: Rosali did not know 'Mark' was actually Mr Bloom as he fired him in this scene

Wait, what?: Rosali fired 'Mark' for incompetence before even finishing his first day

Water under the bridge: Mr Bloom offered to pay off $12,000 in debt and gave Rosali a promotion with a 40 per cent raise

The banished boss was surprisingly upbeat about being booted from the warehouse.

‘It’s a little embarrassing, but I’m glad to see that he takes safety so seriously,’ he said during his walk of shame.

Mr Bloom revealed himself to Rosali later in the episode.

He showed no ill will towards the man for firing him.

The bigwig offered to pay off two-thirds of Rosali’s $18,000 credit card debt and promoted him to a salaried managerial position with a 40 per cent pay raise.

‘Thank you, I’ll do my best, I can do it,’ Rosali said.

‘I know you can,’ Mr Bloom replied.

Mr Bloom has been the president and COO of Family Dollar since 2011. His total compensation last year came out to just over $3.5million, according to Bloomberg.
