The ultimate playboy mansion is to be built in Miami, boasting 60 floors of luxury flats and special car elevators which will bring multi-millionaires and their vehicles straight to the door of their apartment.

The cost of the Porsche Design Tower flats range from $4million for the more modest 3-bedroom option, to $32.5milion for the 16,915sq.ft 4-level penthouse.

Porsche Designs broke ground in April 2013 and is slated for occupancy in 2016 when the rich and beautiful can move in.

The three one-of-a-kind lifts of the Miami beachfront tower, will allow the tenants to park their cars in individual sky-garages connected to each unit.

The Porsche Design Tower also includes a cinema, a full spa, maid’s rooms in all the flats as well as plunge pools on almost every balcony.

The tower will rise 650 ft on the shorefront of Sunny Isles Beach, Miami, and 22 millionaires have already put down deposits for flats, Porsche Design said.

The 132-unit tower has secured over $600 million in sales, with 80 per cent of the building already sold off.

The building is a collaboration between South Florida-based Dezer Development and Germany's Porsche Design Group.

True luxury: Prices for apartments in the tower range from $4million  for the 'modest' three-bedrooms. to $32.5milion for the 16,915sq.ft. penthouse

Juergen Gessler, CEO Porsche Design, said: ‘The opportunity to be part of Porsche Design's first-of-its-kind real estate venture has been paramount to our sales success.

‘Featuring the level of superlative quality and groundbreaking ingenuity synonymous with Porsche Design's Iconic Style, buyers understand the unprecedented value of these properties.

‘The tower is reflecting the Porsche Design luxury brand's hallmarks of technical innovation, forward-thinking and its timeless Iconic Style.

‘The Porsche Design Tower Miami features a one-of-a-kind automobile lift system which will allow owners to park their vehicles in “sky garages” directly next to their units.

‘While typically a luxury reserved for the most elite of penthouses, the building features plunge pools and outdoor summer kitchens on the balconies in almost every unit which completes the feel of the sky residence.’
