Michael Souter, pictured, has been charged with 16 sex offences against male children and 2 offences against adults

A former BBC employee has been charged with sexual offences against children.

Michael Souter, from Loddon, Norfolk, has been charged with 18 offences relating to young boys, plus an offence against a man and one against a woman.

Mr Souter is accused of 10 indecent assaults on a boy under the age of 16 and six sex offences with a boy under 16.

Norfolk Police said the offences date back to between 1979 and 1999 and happened in Norfolk.

Mr Souter, 59, who formerly worked as a presenter for BBC Radio Norfolk, is due before Norwich Magistrates' Court on November 30.

Souter issued a statement which read: 'This is the third time that Norfolk Police have investigated these alleged offences, which I strenuously deny and will vigorously defend.

'On both previous occasions, the Crown Prosecution Service advised against making charges. It has taken Norfolk police nearly 20 years and two years in the current investigation to get to this stage using methods that are now subject to a judicial review in the High Court.

'For that reason, plus the fact I have now been charged, you will understand that I cannot go into detail.

'My close friends have been a tower of strength during what has been an extremely difficult period and I cannot thank them enough for their support.

'I would just ask that nobody jumps to any conclusions and I look forward to being able to prove my innocence and get on with my life.'

Mr Souter formerly worked as a presenter for BBC Radio Norfolk. He is due to appear in court on November 30

Souter now runs a media consultancy.

He was born and brought up in Scotland and attended the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth as a scholarship entrant in 1970.

He began his media career at Radio Clyde as a reporter before moving to the BBC, where he spent nine years producing and presenting programmes for radio and television.

He also has a home in Spain.
