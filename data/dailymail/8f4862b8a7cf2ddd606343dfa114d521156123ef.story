A self-confessed sprout lover  forked out £19.99 for the privilege of chowing down a serving of Brussels sprouts measuring more than 10 inches tall and weighing a whopping 11lb.

Lauren Jackson attempted to polish the plate of greens at Smokeys restaurant in Walsall, West Midlands,

But Ms Jackson fell foul of the festive food challenge.

Diner Lauren Jackson digs in to the giant serving of Brussels Sprouts at Smokeys in Walsall, West Midlands

Brussels sprouts contain the compound sulforaphane, a product of the glucosinolates.

While research is ongoing, studies suggest that sulforaphanes may protect against degenerative brain diseases and even cancer.

This compound is also responsible for the bitterness of overcooked vegetables and is being investigated for antioxidant properties.

Lauren's attempt at eating the sprout mountain was captured on film. 

She started off the challenge on fine form, but it is soon evident in the video that she struggled to cope with the tower of vegetables.

In the end the Brussels beat her and despite generously dousing them in gravy, she was unable to finish her meal.

'I give up, the sprouts have defeated me,' she said as she chucked the leftover vegetables in the bin.

Dean Key, who runs Smokeys with his brother, Dale, believes this is a unique food challenge. 

He said: 'We don't normally do something like this but we wanted to get into the festive spirit.

'I don't mind the odd sprout with my Christmas dinner but I certainly won't be trying this challenge.'

The restaurant - which recently celebrated its second anniversary - also has a mad dog burrito and spicy chilli challenges.

They also previously ran a monster burger challenge where diners were expected to consume three pounds of minced beef, 12 rashers of bacon, a dozen slices of cheese and 12 onion rings in an hour.

All their usual food challenges are £29.95, unless they are completed within the one-hour time limit, and then they are free.

Smokeys launched the challenges after enjoying the hit American show Man vs Food, where presenter Adam Richman travelled the US seeking out the biggest food challenges. 

Winners  earn a spot on the website's Hall of Fame. Customers defeated by their eating task, however, are added to the restaurant's Hall Of Shame.
