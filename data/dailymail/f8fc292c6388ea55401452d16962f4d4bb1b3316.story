Police in Georgia have arrested an 18-year-old man who they say spent about $25,000 that a bank accidentally deposited into his account.

Steven Fields, of Hull, turned himself in Friday. He faces a charge of theft by taking.

The Madison County Sheriff's Department says a teller at a bank in Hull mistakenly deposited a check for approximately $31,000 into the wrong account.

Big spender: Police say Mr Fields went on a wild shopping spree, making purchases at a car dealership and various stores

According to investigators, Mr Fields wasted no time going on a massive shopping spree, with stops at a car dealership, a variety of stores and a fast-food restaurant.

Authorities say there was an effort to come to an agreement between Fields and the bank, and that Fields eventually said he couldn't repay the money.

The 18-year-old, who graduated from high school last year, has an account with the Athens branch of First Citizens Bank.

On March 7, he received an unexpected windfall totaling $31,000 after a bank employee unwittingly processed the deposit into the wrong account, police told the Athens Banner-Herald, because multiple customers have the same name.

Bank employees discovered the error March 17 and immediately found the missing money’s destination. By that time, about $25,000 of the deposit was already gone, police said.

Fields, from nearby Hull, had withdrawn $20,000 in cash and made $5,000 in purchases with his debit card, authorities said.

He was confronted by bank employees about the missing money when he arrived at the bank the following bank and attempted to withdraw more cash.

Fields was asked to return the missing funds but refused, claiming that it was an inheritance from his grandmother's estate.

The teenager eventually agreed to come to an agreement with the bank, which gave him a deadline of March 19 to return the missing $25,000, but Fields was unable to come up with the funds in time.

Nearly four years ago, then 14-year-old Fields wrote prophetically on his Facebook page: 'Life is like a coin. you can spend it in any way you wish, but you only spend it once.'
