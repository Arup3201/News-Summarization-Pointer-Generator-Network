Photos of the noose Pfc. Bradley Manning made from a knotted bedsheet have been released just as the accused conspirator finished day two of the trial that will determine whether or not he willingly helped America’s enemies by engineering the biggest leak of classified material in U.S. history.

The noose, which Manning admitted he made as he contemplated suicide shortly after his 2010 arrest, was used to support the military's argument that it was trying to protect the former Army intelligence officer by keeping him in strict isolation and without clothes at Quantico, Virginia's Marine Corps base.

Manning said November 29 during a pre-trial hearing that he’d fashioned the noose while being held in Kuwait soon after he was accused in May 2010 of leaking reams of military and diplomatic documents to the website WikiLeaks. He said his time in Kuwait was the lowest he felt during his entire confinement.

Exhibit A: Manning contemplated killing himself with this peach-colored noose just after his 2010 arrest. Hacker Adrian Lamo testified Tuesday the soldier was suicidal even before over 'American atrocities in Iraq'

Now, a convicted hacker who took the 
stand June 4 as part of Manning's court martial appears to back up the 
military's assertion the soldier is emotionally unhealthy.

According to the LA Times, Lamo 
testified that Manning called himself 'morally and emotionally troubled' 
and felt like a 'broken soul' who was so troubled by what he described 
as America's atrocities in Iraq that he'd considered suicide.

Lamo also revealed during testimony 
that Manning never said he wanted to aid America’s enemies over the few 
days the two conversed via instance messages in 2010.

Ironically, the hacker—a man named 
Adrian Lamo—was the very same who alerted federal authorities the day 
after Manning told him that he had large amounts of sensitive military 
information at his disposal that he'd been leaking for months.

When
Manning’s defense attorney David Coombs asked Lamo on the stand Tuesday
if the Private First Class had ever said he wanted to help America’s 
enemies, Lamo answered ‘Not in those words, no.’

Manning is on trial for giving hundreds of thousands of documents to the secret-spilling website WikiLeaks. He pleaded guilty to charges that could bring 20 years behind bars, but the military has pressed ahead with a court-martial on more serious charges, including aiding the enemy. That charge carries a potential life sentence.

Suicidal? Manning admitted he considered suicide after his 2010 arrest, and Tuesday, Lamo revealed Manning told him he considered suicide before, due to 'America's atrocities in Iraq'

Lamo started chatting online with Manning on May 20, 2010, and alerted law enforcement the next day about the contents of the soldier's messages, including his mention of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. He said he continued chatting with Manning on and off for six more days.

On cross-examination, Lamo said Manning never told him he wanted to help the enemy and did not express disloyalty to America.

Prosecutors have said they will show the
25-year-old Army intelligence analyst effectively put U.S. military 
secrets into the hands of the enemy, including Osama bin Laden. They 
said they will present evidence that bin Laden requested and obtained 
from another al-Qaida member the Afghanistan battlefield reports and 
State Department cables published by WikiLeaks.

Paying his debt? Lamo was convicted in 2004 of hacking the computer networks of the New York Times and Microsoft and served 6 months house arrest and 2 months probation

Leaked: Lamo, left, testified that Manning, right, seemed emotionally unsound when the two chatted online. Lamo alerted authorities after Manning told him he'd been leaking government documents for months

Suicidal: Manning remained unmoved during Lamo's testimony, in which the convicted hacker revealed the soldier to be emotionally troubled and suicidal

The soldier from Crescent, Okla., has said he did not believe the information would harm the U.S. and he released the information to enlighten the public about the bitter reality of America's wars.

The case is the most high-profile prosecution for the Obama administration, which has been criticized for its crackdown on those who leak information. It's also by far the most voluminous release of classified material in U.S. history, and certainly the most sensational since the 1971 publication of the Pentagon Papers, a secret Defense Department history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.

The 7,000 pages of the Pentagon Papers showed that the U.S. government repeatedly misled the public about the Vietnam War. Their leak to The New York Times set off an epic clash between the Nixon administration and the press and led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling on the First Amendment.

The material WikiLeaks began publishing in 2010 documented complaints of abuses against Iraqi detainees, a U.S. tally of civilian deaths in Iraq, and America's weak support for the government of Tunisia - a disclosure that Manning supporters said helped trigger the Middle Eastern pro-democracy uprisings known as the Arab Spring.

Saintly? Meanwhile, Manning's defense described him as an idealistic and naïve young soldier who wanted to change the world for good

The Obama administration has said the release of the material threatened to expose valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments.

Lamo testified Manning had contacted him because of his notoriety in the hacking community and because of his open support and leadership in the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

Lamo pleaded guilty in 2004 of computer fraud after he was arrested for hacking the computer networks of the New York Times and Microsoft. He was sentenced to six months house arrest and two years probation.

Fame monger? Lamo's testimony came on day two of Manning's trial. On day one of the proceedings, the prosecution painted Manning as a man out for notoriety

Manning chose to have his court-martial heard by a judge instead of a jury. It is expected to run all summer. Much of the evidence is classified, which means large portions of the trial are likely to be closed to reporters and the public.

Federal authorities are looking into whether Assange can also be prosecuted. He has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex-crimes allegations.

'This is not justice; never could this be justice,' Assange said in a statement Monday. 'The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity.'

Serious: The 25-year-old faces 21 charges for leaking sensitive military documents and could face life in jail
