A 23-year-old Norwegian man of Somali origin is being investigated over the bloody attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre last month.

Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, 23, is believed to be one of four men pictured in CCTV footage from the mall which has been released by Kenyan authorities.

Dhuhulow is believed to have links to Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima, who is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group.

He is believed to have left his home in Larvik, 75 miles south of Oslo, for Somalia in 2009 and taken part in the attack by the militant group, al-Shabab.

Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a 23-year-old Norwegian man of Somali origin is being investigated over the attack on Kenya's Westgate shopping centre last month - a relative said he could be the one dressed in a black shirt or jacket

Brainwashed: According to one of his relatives who watched CCTV footage of shooting he may 'have been brainwashed'

Former neighbour Morten Henriksen told BBC's Newsnight that one of the attackers on the video clip, in a black shirt or jacket, 
could be Dhuhulow, whom he described to the programme as 'pretty 
extreme'.

A relative, who spoke anonymously to 
the programme, said Dhuhulow had made a phone call in the summer saying he was in trouble and wanted to come 
home. 

In total at least 67 people died in the September siege and it remains unclear how many militants were involved.

Today it was revealed that two charred bodies pulled from the building in Nairobi 'highly likely' to be attackers, a Kenyan MP told the BBC.

Ndung'u Gethenji, chairman of the parliamentary committee investigating the attack, also said the body of a Kenyan soldier had been recovered.

Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight an estimated  20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up as fighters for the Islamist militant group al-Shabab.

'The biggest problem is the so-called 'Generation 1.5', those who weren't born in Norway, but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures,' he said.

In Norway there are now more than 100,000 Somali immigrants.

Amnesty International award winner Amal Aden (pictured above) has criticised the Somali community in Oslo for being unwilling to integrate into the Norwegian society. 

She says she has not 'fit in' with Somalis there, including the relatives who brought her to the country when she 13.

She claims that Somalis in Norway are often outcast as 'betrayers' if they try to connect with ethnic Norwegians, although she says some Somalis like herself are defiant and want to integrate into their new home.

But many Somalis feel particularly vulnerable as they are not as well established as other Muslim communities such as the Pakistanis who have been there for decades.

Somalia is struggling to rebuild after decades of conflict and a U.N.-backed African Union peacekeeping force is trying to drive out al Qaeda-linked Islamist rebel group al Shabaab.

Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed, known as Ikrima in Kenya, is regarded as one of the most dangerous commanders in the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab and is believed to have spent some time in Norway.

He is thought to have been a target of a SEAL raid earlier this month, although he managed to escape.

Last
 week, Norway's intelligence agency, the PST, said it had sent officers 
to Kenya to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen was involved in the 
attack on the Nairobi mall.

Yesterday chilling footage emerged of the moment a terrorist mercilessly gunned down a shopper during the attack.

Surveillance video from
 a supermarket in the shopping centre shows the moment 
terrified men, women and children ran for their lives from the 
attackers.

One man cowers 
in front of a cashier desk, but he is immediately spotted by one of the 
terrorists who shoots him at close-range and walks away.

Sprawled out in a pool of blood on the shop floor, the man desperately tries to gather the strength to crawl away to safety.

He drags himself up to a sitting position, but falls back on to the tiled flooring.

The gunman soon returns and shows the terrified man no mercy, shooting him again.

The chilling video clips obtained by the news outlet show just the first day of the bloody massacre.

In another surveillance video the British four-year-old who famously told one of the terrorists that he was a 'very bad man' can be seen with his mother and six-year-old sister.

His mother, a film producer, had been queuing to buy milk when the militants struck.

Amazing courage: The boy with his sister,  stands holding a Mars bar given to him by a terrorist outside the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi after being released

Hostile: A terrified teenage girl walks through the supermarket with her hands in the air. She is wearing a white top stained with blood and is being tailed by the gunman

She hid under a cold meat counter in the
 Nakumatt supermarket for an hour-and-a-half with her children beneath 
her before terrorists finally found them and shot her in the thigh.

The trio are shown walking through through the supermarket - the mother is pushing an injured child in a trolley.

They
 are followed by a terrified teenage girl wearing a white top stained 
with blood who is walking along with her hands up in the air.

Behind them a gunman, brandishing an assault rifle, gestures the way.

Bizarrely,
 the terrorists handed the children Mars bars before they fled.

The 
woman, the children and girl were all eventually released.

Another clip shows the terrorists scouting out a supermarket while chatting on their mobile phones.

Al-Shabaab said it remained in contact with the attackers as they battled Kenyan forces during the hostage crisis.

At one point it looks as though one of the terrorists is looking for surveillance cameras.

CNN
 reports that the attackers appear relaxed in several clips - in one 
quiet period they are even seen taking turns for prayer time.

War against terror: The brazen attack by Islamic militants has underscored Kenya's value to the West in the war against terror

Hunt: Two attackers move their way through the mall car park

Horror: Terrified shoppers run in terror as the attackers stalk them through the mall

The brazen attack by Islamic militants has underscored Kenya's value to the West in the war against terror.

The Somali Islamic group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault and said it was in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into neighboring Somalia.

The killers, who were dressed in Western clothes, ordered all Muslims to leave, before carrying out rudimentary tests to see if hostages could recite the Koran and name the mother of the Prophet Mohammed.

Witnesses told how terrorists with faces hidden by Islamic scarves stormed the building, tossing grenades and spraying shoppers with AK-47s.

At one point Kenyan authorities said a woman might have been involved in the attack, prompting speculation that British terrorist suspect Samantha Lewthwaite - who was married to July 7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay - might have had some connection with the attack.

Dubbed the 'White Widow', Lewthwaite is known to be in East Africa and is wanted over alleged links to a terrorist cell that planned to bomb the country's coastal resorts. Interpol issued a notice asking for help in capturing the 29-year-old fugitive over the 2011 plot.
