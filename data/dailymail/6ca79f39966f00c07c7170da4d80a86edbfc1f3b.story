A horrifying 911 tape of a teenage boy calmly confessing to beating his father to death with a cane and burying his body in the back yard was released on Tuesday.

Rylan Salzman, a 16-year-old from Tacoma, Washington, allegedly killed his father on June 6 but waited until the following Tuesday to call police so that he could spend a few last days with his mom and sister.

The seven-minute call, published on KIRO-TV, begins with the teenager telling the 911 dispatcher: 'I'm calling to confess to a killing.'

He goes on to say that he killed his father, Richard Salzman, adding: 'He's outside in a container of sorts.'

Salzman later said that he had put his father's body in a wooden box.

Richard Salzman's body was found buried under a pile of garbage in a container on a compost heap. He was so severely beaten he could only be identified by dental records

The teenager told police that he killed his father at 9pm on Friday after the two of them had been drinking and got into an altercation while he had a cane in his hand.

He told the police dispatcher: 'We'd both been 
drinking some and there was a confrontation.

'I said something to him and
 told him to stop, he shoved me and I had a cane in my hand at the time.

'It wasn't premeditated or anything but I just started swinging. We had a
 conflicted childhood, past. It was sort of a tipping point.'

The 16-year-old pleaded not guilty to one count of second-degree murder after being charged as an adult last Friday.

Richard Salzman, 49, was reported missing on June 5 by his wife Louise Salzman after he disappeared the previous day.

'This is a strange case of patricide,' prosecutor Mark Lindquist told KOMO News last week. 'The motives are still being investigated.'

Before
 admitting on the 911 call that he had killed his father, the 16-year-old told his 
mother that his father had gone on a bike ride that evening, and had 
not returned.

Louise
 Salzman, who had been staying at a family member's home on the night of the murder, filed a 
missing person's report the next day.

Rylan's sister was home at the time of the killing but he told the police dispatcher that 'she was in her room quite a way away and unaware of what was going on'.

Salzman, 16, appears in court last week. He has been charged with his father's murder after he allegedly beat him to death with a cane at home while they had both been drinking

911 dispatcher: '911 what are you reporting?'

Rylan Salzman: 'I'm calling to confess to a killing'

911: 'When and where did this happen?'

Salzman: 'It was last Friday...uh around 9pm at my home.'

911: 'Is that where you are now?'

RS: 'I am there now.'

911: 'Who did you kill?'

RS: 'My father.'

911: 'Is he still there?'

RS: 'Yes.'

911: 'Where in the house is he?'

RS: 'He's outside in a container of sorts.'

Rylan Salzman then provides his name and telephone number to the police officer.

911: 'Is anyone else there with you?'

RS: 'Not
 at the moment. My mother and sister have left for the neighbors for 
the time being. I told them what happened so they left until the police
 took care of things.'

911: 'How did you kill him?'

RS: 'We'd
 both been 
drinking some and there was a confrontation. I said something to him and
 told him to stop, he shoved me and I had a cane in my hand at the time.
 It wasn't premeditated or anything but I had been drinking an I just 
started swinging. We had a
 conflicted childhood... past. It was sort of a tipping point.'

911: 'What sort of container is he in?'

RS: 'A wooden box. It's quite a large piece of land, a large space.'

911: 'Has anyone else seen the body?'

RS: 'No'

The dispatcher then asks for Salzman's middle name and his date of birth.

911: 'You mother and sister aware but they've gone to another address?'

RS: 'I
 told them half an hour ago, that I was calling in, that it would be 
better if they were out of the way when they come and take care of 
things.'

911: 'They live there with you?'

RS: 'They do.'

911: 'Do you know the address where they are?'

RS: 'It's right next door.'

911: 'You're not armed?'

RS: 'I'm not armed, I'm not going to resist arrest, I'm here waiting.'

911: 'Stay on the line with me please, don't hang up.'

911: 'Have you been drinking taking any drugs today?'

RS: 'No.'

911: 'Was anyone else there with you when this happened?'

RS: 'My sister was at home at the time, she was in her room quite a way away and unaware of what was going on.'

911: 'Did your mom or sister wonder about your father's absence before today?'

RS:
 'Oh
 yes... truth is, I had every intention of confessing sooner or later 
but I wanted a few 
more days with them before that happened... but in the meantime, they 
had been looking 
around and had arrived at a point where they were going hire search and 
rescue operator... At that point, well it would be quite pricey so that 
would be the time... She did file a missing persons report.'

911: 'Just stay on the line, we'll have someone with you as soon as possible.'

RS: 'Ok, thank you.'

After filing a missing person's report on her husband with police, Mrs Salzman had decided to gather a 
search party, which according to her son 'would be quite pricey' so he decided to confess.

The 
teenager told his mother that they could find the body at the family's 
home although he did not say where.

A team later searched the area, 
finding Richard Salzman in a wooden box which contained a compost heap.

The body was partially covered with dirt, cat litter, a cut-up bicycle, and motor oil.

The Pierce County Medical Examinerâ€™s office said last week that Richard 
Salzman died of blunt force injuries to the head.

His death was ruled a 
homicide.

Police at the Salzman home looking at the wooden compost bin where Richard Salzman's body was found. According to the medical examiner's report, Salzman was so badly beaten that he could only be identified by dental records

According to the Medical Examiner, he had been beaten so severely that he could only be identified through dental records.

'It's deeply disturbing, obviously,' Teresa Salzman, Richard Salzman's niece, told KIRO7.

'It's just something, I guess, you could never forsee happening.'

According to Teresa Salzman, Richard was a loving, caring man.

'He was essentially a father to me' said Teresa, 'and he loved his family and his children dearly.'

Following Rylan's arraignment, his bail was set at $1 million. His next court appearance is scheduled for July 16.
