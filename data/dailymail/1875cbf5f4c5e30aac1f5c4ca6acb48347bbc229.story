A lack of space in aircraft carry-on bags is a huge gripe for travellers.

And for tourists who like to buy souvenirs and holiday bargains, it can mean buying a second suitcase to return home with.

However, a new design is promising to be the world’s most revolutionary luggage for shopaholics – by inflating from a carry-on size to the maximum check-in baggage size at the push of a button.

The bag expands by inflating the side walls with air pressure through a built-in electric pump

Additional benefits include removable storage shelves and a portable table top feature

Called Fugu, and currently crowdsourcing for funds on Kickstarter, the case has been measured to comply with airline size limitations.

Its name is inspired by the Fugu fish, which is the Japanese word for pufferfish, and expands by inflating the side walls with air pressure through a built-in electric pump.

It inflates from the maximum carry-on size to the maximum check-in size that passengers are allowed on board a plane.

Described as the 'Mary Poppins bag of suitcases,' the luggage features removable shelves, which enable the suitcase to double as a storage unit, can be used as a portable table, a makeshift laptop stand or make-up dresser.

The light-weight suitcase is also extremely durable and has shock-absorbing walls to protect your belongings

Two for the price of one! It's easily-collapsible design also allows for easier storage at home

Made from the same material used to make surfboards, the bag also has shock-absorbing walls to protect its cargo.

Isaac Atlas, Inventor, Founder and Industrial Designer, said: 'When we started working with the lab one of our main challenges was making it both strong and low-weight.

‘As you can see… it’s pretty strong.’

Isaac says he got the idea for Fugu in early 2013 after arguing with his wife over what size luggage he should take on a trip.

‘The idea for FUGU came from my wife,' he explains in the video. 

A fully-functioning prototype of the 'Mary Poppins bag of suitcases' now exists but the company has only reached about 50% of their donation goals on Kickstarter

The bag is also completely waterproof and has tyres that move 360 degrees in all directions 

The answer to the suitcase dilemma has arrived! With FUGU LUGGAGE, you no longer need to choose

'She kept telling me that I needed a larger suitcase for my travels and I kept stubbornly saying, "Carry on is enough".

'Obviously she was right, but instead of admitting that to her, I invented Fugu luggage.’

With just 18 days to go, the company has already received $214,475 (£137,000) in pledges – beyond its $50,000 goal.

If all goes according to plan, development for Fugu, which is in the prototype stage, should be completed and mass produced by early next year.

The Israel-based company hopes to sell the all-in-one bag for $300 (or approximately £191) and it will be available in a range of colours.
