The host of a right wing radio show with a dislike for
Hillary Clinton wants to take out his grudge by shooting her in the vagina.

Pete Santilli isn’t extremely well known, nor are his ideas
mainstream, but he’s managed to get some rather big names on his radio show of
late. Recent guests on the internet-based show including NRA board member Ted
Nugent and Gun Owners of America director Larry Pratt and have lent some
heightened visibility to Santilli’s homespun show.

Now the conspiracy theorist has really doubled down on increasing his name recognition, though it may not be in the wisest way.

Low blow: Conspiracy theorist and host of a right wing internet broadcast Pete Santilli said last week he wants to 'shoot Hillary Clinton in the vagina.'

While discussing the Benghazi scandal, an enraged Santilli said
he wanted former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to pay for ‘all the
Americans [she’s] killed.’

‘I want to shoot her right in the vagina,’ Santilli said
last week. ‘On behalf of all of those people, I’m supporting our troops by
saying we need to try, convict, and shoot Hillary Clinton in the vagina.’

The shocking comment apparently stems from the host’s belief
that the Obama administration faked the Osama bin Laden capture.

‘On behalf of all Americans that you’ve killed,’ he said, ‘on
behalf of the Navy SEALS, the families of Navy SEAL Team Six who were involved
in the fake hunt down of this Obama, Obama bin Laden thing, that whole fake
scenario, because these Navy SEALS know the truth, they killed them all.’

Shock jock: Santilli believes Clinton, along with Obama, allowed Americans to die and deserve to be shot for treason--in the genitals in Clinton's case

But Santilli didn’t reserve his wraith for Clinton. He also
had words for the president himself and warned listeners that those who
disagreed shall be deemed un-American.

‘Barack Obama needs to be tried, convicted, and shot for
crimes against the United States of America,’ he said. ‘And if anybody has a
problem with that, then you are an enemy of our state.’

The host’s rants aren’t reserved for Democrats, though. On
the same show, he called for the Bush family to be shot for treason.

Though his recent words are decidedly uncouth, they are a
far cry from the most unbelievable comments he’s made.

Bold: Santilli's show is available only online, but he says he is willing to go national if the FCC 'can handle my truth & honesty'

Santilli posted an article on his website in December that
mapped out his belief the Sandy Hook massacre was a Satanic human sacrifice
that was based on rituals seen in the most recent Batman film and further
proven by the elementary school’s central location between Stonehenge and the
Aztec Pyramid of the Sun.

Santilli also espouses beliefs that high tech energy beams
are what took down the Twin Towers on 9/11 and that George H.W. Bush and ‘his
cronies’ orchestrated the JFK assassination, among other theories.

On his site, Santilli says he's prepared to take his truther message and unusual ideas to a national audience, if the audience is ready for him.

'I am a radio talkshow host ready to take my show to national syndication,' he writes. 'That is, of course, if the FCC regulated AM/FM radio stations can handle my truth & honesty.'
