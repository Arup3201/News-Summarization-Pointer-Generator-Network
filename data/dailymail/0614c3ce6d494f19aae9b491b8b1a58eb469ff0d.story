Warning: Mark Carney told the Treasury Select Committee a 'Yes' vote could have a major impact on RBS

Royal Bank of Scotland could be forced to move to England if voters north of the border back independence, Mark Carney said yesterday.

The Bank of England Governor told MPs there is a ‘distinct possibility’ that RBS would have to leave an independent Scotland.

He also said taxpayers in the rest of the UK would be forced to bail out Scotland in the event of crisis if it was allowed to keep the pound.

The comments were a further setback for Alex Salmond and the ‘Yes’ campaign ahead of the referendum in September.

Mr Salmond, First Minister of the Scottish Government and leader of the Scottish National Party, wants to create a ‘sterling zone’ with the rest of the UK if the country goes it alone.

But Chancellor George Osborne has already ruled out a currency union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK in a move backed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats.

And firms including Standard Life and Alliance Trust have warned that they may move south of the border if Scotland votes to go it alone.

Giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee yesterday, Mr Carney raised the prospect of Scotland’s biggest bank deserting the country after independence.

Asked if RBS would have to move, the central bank chief said: ‘It is a distinct possibility.’

European law dictates that banks have their headquarters in states where they do most of their business and have the most customers.

But both RBS and Lloyds do more business in England than in Scotland - raising the prospect that they will have to move if Scotland declares independence.

Mr Carney also told MPs that any ‘informal adoption of sterling’ by an independent Scotland without an agreed currency union would mean the Bank of England could no longer stand behind its banks.

And he suggested the rest of the UK could end up bailing out Scotland if it was hit by a financial crisis.

He said ‘when push came to shove’ stricken countries in the eurozone had to be rescued despite a ‘no-bailout clause’.

The Canadian said: ‘Would it be credible to stand by if an independent Scotland were to be in fiscal difficulties?’

But Mr Carney dismissed claims that he thought a currency union was a bad idea for the UK.

‘I have been absolutely clear and I will continue to be clear that what I have tried to do, what the Bank has tried to do, and what we will continue to do is to draw attention to economic issues which the interested parties can address and then others can make the judgments,’ he told MPs.

‘At no time have I said, or will I say, that I do not support or that I advocate a currency union, either side of the debate.’

The move would be a blow for Alex Salmond who wants to create a 'sterling zone'

A spokesman for the pro-union Better Together campaign said: ‘This is an important contribution from the Bank of England Governor.

'What people in Scotland need is clarity from Alex Salmond about his Plan B for what would replace the pound. Would we have to sign up to the euro, as Mark Carney said, or would we set up an unproven separate currency?

‘No doubt Alex Salmond’s response will be the same as every other time an expert has questioned his plans - Mark Carney is wrong and only the First Minister is right. It simply isn’t credible.’

SNP MP Stewart Hosie, the party’s Treasury spokesman and a member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘I am pleased that the Governor took this opportunity to confirm the Bank of England’s neutrality on the issue of Scottish independence.’
