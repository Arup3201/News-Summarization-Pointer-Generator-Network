'All of my family has believed - my aunt Eunice, my father Senator Robert Kennedy, my uncle Senator Ted Kennedy and my uncle President John F. Kennedy - that in the small diverse acts that people commit each day, that we can create awareness and change,' he said.

'And so today I'm nominating my entire family to dump buckets of ice over their heads for ALS!'

The challenge is part of a social media campaign on behalf of ALS (amytrophic lateral sclerosis) patient Pete Frates, The Boston Globe reported.

The paper explained that a nominee is taped speaking about the campaign, completing the challenge and nominating someone else to do the same in a 24-hour period - and must make an ALS donation if the challenge is not completed.Â 

A Facebook page in support of Frates, called Team Frate Train, praised the Kennedys' icy endeavor.

'Thank you Kennedy family - we are grateful!' it said.
