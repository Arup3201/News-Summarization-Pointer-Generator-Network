But as for the UK's David Cameron, he has remained uncommitted about whether he will make it to Brazil to support his side.

He did however, record a good luck message for the England team ahead of their first match in the World Cup in Brazil against Italy.

An English flag has also been raised above Downing Street, the home of the British Prime Minister, in anticipation of the upcoming matches.

The Dutch King Willem-Alexander and his wife Maxima were in Brazil for today's
 match between the Netherlands and Australia in the southern city of Porto Alegre.
