An Australian man who ditched his day job and used his expertise as a patent lawyer to create the 'world's smallest washing machine' - won't be returning to work any time soon.

Fed-up with having to pack large suitcases full of clothes when he travelled - Ashley Newland came up with an idea, over a few beers in an Adelaide pub, to invent a durable and lightweight washing machine that travellers the world over could use.

It was a few weeks prior to his trip to Tanzania, back in 2012, that Mr Newland spawned the idea of the Scrubba - and now the product has gone global. 'I'm selling tens of thousands of units,' Mr Newland said.

The Scrubba can be used in almost any location and is the perfect travel companion for travellers packing light

The scrubba has an internal washboard built in and can hold up to 30 litres of water

The Scrubba, he says, is so unique there is 'no equivalent anywhere like it' - and he would know.

Employed as a patent lawyer, Mr Newland was working for clients who had big ideas and decided he wanted to create his own. He originally had plans to sell his idea to big manufacturers, but when noone picked it up because they thought it was too ridiculous, he went it alone.

He created a three-month crowd funding page to prove The Scrubba could hold its own, and netted a whopping $25000.

Mr Newland was convinced that his life as a lawyer was over and followed his entrepreneurial pursuits, so he went ahead with creating the 145-gram product which folds down in to roughly the size of a can of coke, without his partner.

He said his friend pulled the pin when The Scrubba, which is just 52 centimetres but remarkably can hold up to 13 litres of water, got serious because he 'wasn't prepared to quit his job.'

That man is now kicking himself.

Mr Newland has sold the product, which sells for $64.95, to distributors and individuals in more than 50 countries

The invention, which Forbes magazine listed as one of its '10 greatest travel products' in 2012, has travelled with Mr Newland across three continents and has sold to distributors and individuals across 50 countries.

He is confident the product, which sells for $64,95, is on the verge of being picked up by a major US camping retailer.

Mr Newland said at the outset he wasn't looking for fame or fortune, he just happened to find a hole in the market and came up with the invention that he would use every time he went travelling.

'I was about to climb Mt Kilimanjaro and didn't want to pack all these bulky items,' he said.

'I knew I'd be washing almost every day, and in Africa there are no wash facilities, not even a sink.'

He said he: 'wanted to create something that was as gentle on clothes as hand washing' so came up with an idea of an incredibly flexible thin washboard, welded inside a bag.

Mr Newland has used his expertise in patent law to secure patents in Australia and New Zealand, and patents pending in another 52 countries.

Brad Slater, general manager of Dometic, an international supplier of goods to the recreational vehicle and marine industries, says new innovations such as the Scrubba have dramatically changed the camping industry and will continue to do so.

'Portable showers, washing machines and refrigerators have all been game-changers,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald.
