Dean McDermott packed his bags and headed for Canada again, leaving his troubled wife alone on Mother’s Day!

Dean returned to Toronto Saturday afternoon to film his number one Canadian show, Chopped Canada, after it was picked up for another season.

But sources say, no one works on Sunday and McDermott certainly could have spent at least part of the holiday with the mother of his four children.

‘Tori and Dean’s relationship has been so bad, that you would think he would have done his best to spend at least part of the day with Tori,’ says a source. ‘But for some reason he felt he had to fly into the Canada on Saturday, leaving Tori on her own for Mother’s Day.’

Don't leave us: Dean lleft Tori and their four kids behind and flew off to Toronto on May 9. Toronto was the city where he cheated on his sad wife

To add salt to the wound, Tori’s mom Candy Spelling was also out of town promoting her new book, Candy at Last, so the 40 year old actress couldn’t even share a Mother’s Day meal with her mom.

‘At a time when Tori should have been surrounded by people who love her, she was alone with the kids, waiting on them and seeing to their every need,’ says the source. ‘My heart goes out to her.’

The source confides that the last thing Tori and Dean need right now is for him to leave town. And to make matters worse… the job is going to require him to be away for six to eight weeks!

In the episode of True Tori that aired last night, the couple hotly debated his return to Canada to film the show's second season. But MailOnline learned exclusively that his leaving was a fait accomplis.

McDermott 47, hosts the show, Chopped Canada, which is the Canadian version of Food Network’s US Chopped  series, and the network is thrilled with the ratings. But the timing is terrible for him to return to work, right in the middle of he and Tori trying to put the pieces of their marriage back together. 

Working girl: Tori has a lot on her mind as she makes her way to the studio today. She can't join Dean in Toronto because the two older kids are in school and she's working on her new TV series

‘Tori and Dean have been pulling out all the stops in an effort to save their marriage,’ says the source. ‘They desperately want to stay together for the sake of their four children, Liam, 7, Stella who turns 6 in June, Haddie, 2 ½ and 1 ½ year old Finn.

Tori wants nothing more than for things to go back to the way they were before Dean cheated last December, but no matter how much counseling they go through – as seen on their reality show True Tori – things don’t seem to be getting better.

‘Dean is adamant about the fact he strayed because he wasn’t getting enough attention at home, but Tori calls that ‘unfair,’ saying that for half their marriage she was pregnant, carrying his kids!

‘Tori and Dean just celebrated their 8th anniversary,’ says a source. ‘And she has been pregnant for four out of eight of those years. So to criticize her for not being into sex enough for his tastes is just plain cruel.

Not only was she pregnant all that time, she’s been taking care of back to back babies practically since the day they walked down the aisle. And she suffers excruciating pain due to recently diagnosed spinal disc problems.

‘And caring for her family is not her only job,’ adds the source. ‘She’s also busy pitching ideas for projects, filming her shows, and taking care of responsibilities like doctor and dentist appointments for the children.’

The source says what makes Dean’s departure even worse is he’s returning to Toronto – the scene of his cheating! And Tori can’t join him because the two older kids are in school and she’s working on her new series with Jennie Garth.

‘It was when Dean was in Toronto the last time that he met another woman and ended up cheating on Tori,’ says the source. ‘And of course she’s worried that once he’s away again, the same thing could happen. Especially since things are a lot worse now than they ever were before he cheated.

On her own: Tori  is left holding the fort with her kids in LA. She may be  alone when daughter Stella has to have her tonsils out in the next couple weeks

‘Tori always says she didn’t understand his decision to cheat because the weekend before he betrayed her, they’d spent most of the weekend having great sex. So you can’t blame her for being worried.

‘This also means Tori might be in LA alone when their daughter Stella has to have her tonsils out in the next couple weeks. Unless Dean can convince the show’s producers to let him have a couple days off to go home and be there for his little girl.’

‘Dean is also concerned that by leaving, it’s going to delay them finding a way to work through things,’ says the source. ‘He even thought about backing out of his commitments all together. But he is under contract and the show’s popularity has boosted his popularity too, not to mention the fact he took a pay hike this new season, and he and Tori are trying desperately to straighten out their finances.’
