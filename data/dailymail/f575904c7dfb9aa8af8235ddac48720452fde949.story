Senior Tories must publish details of their ‘secret trysts’ with foreign billionaires and party donors, the former head of Britain’s sleaze watchdog warned last night.

Sir Alistair Graham said revelations about senior ministers mingling with Russian oligarchs, hedge fund billionaires and lobbyists at private Tory fundraising dinners were having a ‘corrosive effect’ on public trust.

Sir Alistair, former chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the issue was a problem for all three parties. The Prime Minister was under fire yesterday after the guest list for a £12,000-a-table Tory party was leaked to the media.

It revealed that Mr Cameron, his wife Samantha, and a string of other senior Tories, including Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, entertained an exotic array of foreign plutocrats, hedge fund managers and lobbyists in return for cash.

And last night it emerged that Ed Miliband is to host his own Labour fundraising gala, where ‘premium’ tables will cost £15,000 each.

The Prime Minister yesterday dismissed critics of the party’s reliance on wealthy donors, saying it was better than Labour’s reliance on the unions.

Last night Mr Cameron hosted another lavish summer party for wealthy supporters at London’s exclusive Hurlingham Club. The Conservative Party refused to publish the guest list.

Sir Alistair urged Mr Cameron and other party leaders to come clean.

‘These events have a corrosive effect on public trust because there is no transparency,’ he said. ‘We have no idea who is lobbying who or what is being discussed – the public is completely cut out.

‘If ministers held meetings with these people in their offices, they would have to publish the details. But we know nothing about these secret trysts unless there is some kind of leak. It is unacceptable.

‘It is perfectly legitimate for parties to seek donations, but it must be transparent – not done on the back of giving access to cabinet ministers.

‘In my experience people don’t pay substantial amounts of money unless they have got an agenda of some sort. It’s a problem for all the main parties.’

The new revelations cast fresh light on the way the Conservatives are generating a huge war chest to fight the next election. Fundraisers have been ordered to raise a staggering £100,000 a day to build an election machine to crush Mr Miliband. Sources say this inevitably means asking wealthy individuals to reach for their chequebooks.

The Daily Mail revealed this year that the Conservatives rely heavily on a group of about 70 major donors who pay a minimum of £50,000 a year each to be members of Mr Cameron’s elite ‘Leader’s Group’. In return, they are invited to regular dinners, lunches and cocktail parties with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers. Members of the group have given a staggering £43million to the party since records began in 2001.

But the Tories also host numerous other fundraising dinners.

The leaked dinner plan contains details of an event held last summer in the City. Guests included six billionaires and 15 others with fortunes worth more than £100million. There were 73 financiers, 47 retail and property tycoons, ten people in oil, gas and mining and 19 working in lobbying and PR.

In an extraordinary move, some guests were placed on tables with senior ministers responsible for their area of commercial activity.

Criticism: Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the 'trysts' were having a 'corrosive effect' on public life

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing – and no evidence that any guests or ministers discussed areas of mutual interest.

But the mere fact that ministers and wealthy businessmen are able to hold private talks away from the public gaze concerns some campaigners.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, for example, was seated with Greek shipping magnate Constantine Logothetis. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who has responsibility for planning, was seated with controversial Russian-born businessman Alexander Temerko, whose firm builds off-shore windfarms.

Labour said many of the foreign guests appeared to own mansions in the UK and were likely to be hit by Labour and Lib Dem plans for a mansion tax.

A Tory spokesman last night said  all donations were in accordance with the law.

But campaigners say a wide-ranging clean-up of party funding is needed.

Alexandra Runswick, of Unlock Democracy, said: ‘Whether it is party donors given seats in the House of Lords or people buying dinner with David Cameron, the public feels our politics are for sale – that politicians listen to donors and lobbyists but not voters.’

Ed Miliband has claimed to be reducing his party's financial reliance on the unions

Labour faces its own questions over its financial dependence  on the unions and claims that  they have been allowed to dictate party policy.

Funding from the union paymasters accounts for three-quarters of large donations raised by the party.

Leader Ed Miliband has claimed to be reducing his party’s financial reliance on unions, but critics have accused him of increasingly writing party policy from union demands.

In May, Unite made its biggest donation since Mr Miliband became leader (£1.8million) just days after Labour unveiled plans to cap private rents – a policy long demanded by the union.

And only this week, Unite announced it would bankroll its election campaign – with Unite boss ‘Red Len’ McCluskey telling Mr Miliband to ‘bring home the bacon’ for his members as he pledged £12million at a speech to members in Liverpool on Monday.

At the same time, Unite members began to vote for a ‘wish list’ of policies – including higher taxes, more public spending, and the repeal of all trade union laws passed in the past three decades. Unite have already donated more than £12million to Labour since Mr Miliband beat his brother, David, to become leader with its support.

Mr McCluskey said: ‘Unite stands fully behind Labour and Ed Miliband in the increasingly radical agenda he has outlined. Have conviction, Ed. Ignore the personal stuff, it is trivial nonsense.’

Mr McCluskey, whose union became embroiled in the Falkirk vote rigging scandal, also boasted of its influence in selecting Labour candidates to stand as MPs, saying there were ‘more union-backed candidates than for a generation’.

Figures from the Electoral Commission show that 75 per cent of donations to Labour in the first quarter of this year came from unions.

The Lib Dems, meanwhile, are facing a possible police probe into ‘cash-for-honours’ allegations.

Last month it emerged that the party’s three biggest donors – who have provided two-fifths of the party’s donations – were given peerages by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

The three Lords – Ministry of Sound magnate James Palumbo, Domino’s Pizza founder Rumi Verjee and clothes tycoon Raj Loomba – donated about £600,000 between them.

Police are reviewing the evidence before deciding whether to mount an investigation.

The Lib Dems want public funding for political parties to end the need to raise cash. Labour is sympathetic to the idea, but it has been rejected by the Conservatives, who say voters would not accept paying for political parties through their taxes.
