With his long floppy ears and apparently docile demeanour, Toby the rabbit is hardly as threatening as a guard dog.

But for one family, he has certainly proved just as effective.

Kimberley May told yesterday how her huge pet rabbit scared off a burglar – by thumping his massive feet on the floor.

Protector: Kimberley May and her three-year-old daughter Olivia with giant bunny Toby after he scared off a burglar by thumping loudly

She and her fiance Martin had only had
 two-year-old Toby for a couple of weeks when an intruder broke into 
their home in Plymouth.

But his owners believe the raider was scared off thanks to the British Giant rabbit stomping his feet in his cage.

Miss May, a hospital staff nurse, said
 she was half woken in the early hours by Toby making ‘five loud thumps’
 but she went back to sleep.

In the morning, Martin went downstairs
 and found a First World War medal, a  laptop and iPad were missing – 
but a  lot of other valuables had been left behind. Miss May said: ‘We 
went to bed on Wednesday at about 10pm. In the early hours of the 
morning Toby our rabbit did five loud thumps. I sort of half woke up 
then realised he’d stopped and went back to sleep.

‘When I went downstairs, every single 
cupboard and drawer was open, there were bits out everywhere. Then we 
started noticing that things were missing and we phoned the police.

‘They managed to take a laptop, an 
iPad and my handbag with my purse and everything in, but the worst thing
 was my great-granddad’s medal.’

Intruder: The thief broke into the family home in Plymouth without realising it was under the protection of a monster bunny

Raising the alarm: The 4.5kg, 2ft-long pet began stomping so loudly on the floor that the intruder fled

The medal was a King’s Liverpool 
Regiment medal belonging to Henry Godwin Porter. It is silver and 
inscribed with his name and regiment. Miss May added: ‘My gran died in 
2007, she lived in a council house all her life and hardly had any 
possessions. That was the one important thing she had.’

Miss May said she found a hoard of 
items left piled up on the sofa which she thinks the burglar was 
preparing to take but left behind.

‘We think that when the rabbit thumped
 it scared off the burglars and they left all the stuff they were going 
to take,’ she added.

The couple, who have a three-year-old 
daughter, Olivia, are due to get married in nearby Plympton on August 
30. Miss May said: ‘They also took a box which had all our wedding 
invitations and favours in it as well as paperwork which I was due to 
give to the church and reception venue.

Reward: Toby's delighted owner has bought him a new tunnel to play with as a thank you present

Hero: When Miss May came downstairs she found a hoard of items left piled up on the sofa which she thinks the burglar was preparing to take but left behind

‘I’ve had to go to the library to get proof that I used to live in Plympton so I can get married at the church – they just don’t think about the impact it has to take things like that.’

After the break-in, Toby was left ‘traumatised’ and even tried to attack the policeman who came  to investigate.

The 4.5kg rabbit is nearly 2ft long and 10in tall, and he could yet grow more – British Giant rabbits can reach up to 5.9kg.

Toby is so big he lives in a cage built for a labrador.

The family got their prized pet from an animal adoption centre which had taken him in.

Miss May said: ‘He’s playful, really friendly, and he doesn’t mind my three-year-old crawling all over him. He’s like a small dog really.

‘When he thumps on the floor it’s incredibly loud – you can hear it echoing around the house.’

Police are appealing for information about the break-in, which happened a week ago.

PC David Walters said: ‘They had the rabbit in the kitchen and mentioned that he was making a noise in the night. But there was nothing to say the burglar was definitely scared off.’
