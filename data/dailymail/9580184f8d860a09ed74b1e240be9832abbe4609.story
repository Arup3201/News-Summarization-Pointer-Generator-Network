An American college student who went missing while studying abroad in Rome was killed by a train.

Bates College junior John Durkin, 21, was last seen by friends at about 2.30am on Thursday, at a bar called Sloppy Sam’s.

Family members had flown from Rye, in New Hampshire, to Italy to help with the search, but his body was spotted in a tunnel by a passenger on a train on Thursday.

Durkin's body was removed from the tunnel, which runs under a large park between the Vatican and  Trastevere neighborhood in Rome, by Italian authorities, CBS News reported.

Italian railway authorities confirmed on Saturday that he had been been killed by a train.

A statement from his university president, Clayton Spencer, said: 'This is a time of deep sadness for our community and for so many people who knew and loved John.

'We are profoundly sad and share the tremendous grief of his family.'

Bates head football coach Mark Harriman added:'John’s commitment to excellence in all phases of his life was inspirational to the other members of the squad and a major factor in the team’s success over the past three years.

'We will remember the fortitude and character that John displayed on a daily basis and attempt to emulate those standards.'

Durkin had been in Rome for just over a month while studying abroad for the spring semester, and was last seen with friends at the bar in Rome's Camp de Fiore neighborhood.

He had stayed behind after they went home, according to WBZ. Witnesses said the college football player left not long after, but he never made it back to his dorm room, according to a family friend who spoke to the station.

‘They were out at a bar called Sloppy Sam’s which is in sort of a collegiate area,’ Spence Lockhart said. ‘He stayed on a little bit later. They had gone back to their dormitories and he stayed on and that’s the last time they saw him.’

He had since virtually disappeared off the grid, and now his family knows why.

‘There’s no cell phone. There’s no activity. There’s no activity on his credit cards, nothing that would indicate he’s traveling outside the area,’ Lockhart added. ’That’s why we’re so concerned.’

Joining Lockhart and the Durkin family in that concern were Italian authorities, the US Embassy in Rome and even the FBI, all of whom were working together to find the missing economics major.

Lockhart shared his optimism Durkin would be found alive less than 24 hours before authorities made the sobering find.

'I can't think of a nicer young man, Lockhart told WTMW. 'This is something that is very scary, but we certainly feel like we are going to bring him home safe.'

Officials still have yet to flesh out the exact details surrounding Durkin’s disappearance.

The study abroad program was administered through Trinity College, in Hartford, Connecticut.

A Bates statement said the two schools are working with both Italian and American officials.

‘This situation is deeply distressing for John’s family, his fellow students and the entire Bates community,’ the college said. ‘We are working actively with Trinity College to monitor events as they evolve, and we will share information as it becomes available.’

The family had set up a Twitter account to help in the search, it already has nearly 1,100 followers.

A MailOnline request left with family for further comment has not yet been returned.
