A Swedish artist has won the bid to create the three memorials for the victims of the 2011 Utøya tragedy in Norway.

The July 22 terror attacks killed eight in a bombing at the government headquarters in Oslo and 69 people, mostly teenagers, were murdered by Anders Breivik in a shooting spree at a youth camp organised by Norway’s social-democratic Arbeiderpartiet.

Artist Jonas Dahlberg's Memory Wound will be a 3.5metre (11ft 6in) channel cut in the mainland facing Utøya, creating a 'physical wound' in the landscape.

In memoriam: Swedish artist Jonas Dahlberg's winning bid for the memorials honouring the victims of the July 22 attacks include a 11ft6in cut in the mainland facing Utøya, a 'physical wound' in the landscape

The excavation will represent the physical experience of something being taken and 'reflect the abrupt and permanent loss of those who died on Utøya'.

The 3.5metre wide gap will have the names of all 77 victims, both Oslo and Utøya, engraved on its sides.

The material cut from the site at Sørbråten opposite Utøya island will be transported to Oslo to be used to build a memorial at the site of the bombings.

It will also be used to create a temporary memorial pathway in Oslo’s government quarter to connect the two memorial sites.

All three memorials will cost the Norwegian government £27million NOK, approximately £2.7m.

Never forget: The memorial on Sørbråten peninsula opposite the island will have the names of all 77 victims, both Oslo and Utøya, engraved on its sides

Honour: Visitors will not be able to touch the names engraved on the opposite wall of Memory Wound

The memorials will remember the victims of the July 22 terror attacks which saw eight die in a bombing at the government headquarters in Oslo and 69 people, mostly teenagers, were murdered by Anders Breivik at a political youth camp on Utøya island

A permanent memorial in Oslo will 
feature an amphitheater using trees taken from Sørbråten to maintain the
 relationship between the memorials on both sites, and the connection 
between the victims.

Murderer: Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people on July 22, 2011

The 
jury, comprising representatives from victim support groups, the 
government and AUF - the Norwegian Labour Party Youth League made an 
unanimous decision.

‘Jonas Dahlberg’s proposal takes the emptiness and traces of the tragic events of 22 July as its starting point,’ the jury said in a statement.

‘It is capable of conveying and confronting the trauma and loss that the 22 July events resulted in in a daring way.

‘The proposal is radical and brave, and evokes the tragic events in a physical and direct manner.’

White supremacist Anders Behring Breivik is serving a 21-year prison sentence for the terrorist attacks on Utøya  and in Oslo .

His sentence can be extended for as long as he's considered dangerous.

Just last month, Norwegian police rejected a complaint by Breivik that the he is being held under illegal conditions, which saw him threaten to go on hungerstrike unless he got a better Playstation and a larger gym.

He also complained about being kept in isolation and demanded access to better video games and a sofa.
