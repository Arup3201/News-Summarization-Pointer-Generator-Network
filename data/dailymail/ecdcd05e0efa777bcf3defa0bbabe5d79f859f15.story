Rampant corruption in China’s ruling Communist Party could topple the regime, the country’s outgoing president Hu Jintao warned yesterday.

And in chilling words that will rattle its anxious neighbours, Mr Hu said China must be prepared to strengthen its military.

During his opening speech to the 18th party congress, Mr Hu said of corruption: ‘If we fail to handle this issue well, it could prove fatal to the party, and even cause the collapse of the party and the fall of the state.’

Mr Hu added senior officials should 
strengthen ‘supervision over their families and their staff, and they 
should never seek any privilege’.

His warning comes after revelations 
that the close family of outgoing premier Wen Jiabao was exposed as 
having amassed around £2billion in ‘hidden riches’.

And on the eve of the congress, 
high-ranking politician Bo Xilai was formally expelled from the party, 
following the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood by Bo’s wife Gu
Kailai last November.

The Bo scandal has overshadowed the handover of power and exposed infighting and horse trading among hard-liners and reformers.

At the congress, Mr Hu promised political reform – but he ruled out copying Western-style democracy.

He also said army generals must 
transform ‘China into a maritime power’ to ensure it could ‘win a local 
war in the information age’ to defend its territorial claims in the 
resource-rich seas off its coast.

Mr Hu’s successor Xi Jinping will be unveiled next week and will officially take over in March.

The all-male Standing Committee, 
consisting of seven to nine politicians, will also be revealed. Chosen 
behind closed doors, the committee is the apex of power in the country.

Heavy security has surrounded the party congress which is in effect a rubber-stamp process and a show of unity and power

Scores of dissidents have been hauled away by security agents or placed under house arrest.

Delegates filed into Beijing's Great 
Hall of the People, bedecked with red banners, and the congress was 
declared open after the national anthem played.

The 2,268 delegates are drawn from 
the 82million-member party where the real deal-making is done by a few 
dozen power-brokers behind the scenes, even as China is ever more 
connected to the world through trade and the Internet.

In a speech aimed at outlining the successes of the past five years and challenges for the future, Mr
Hu said: 'We are faced with unprecedented opportunities for 
developments as well as risks. The party must keep in mind the trust of 
the people.

'The fight against corruption remains a serious challenge for us.'

Coming so soon after President Barack 
Obama's re-election in the U.S., the congress has drawn unfavourable 
comparisons from politically minded Chinese who have bemoaned how little
direct influence they have in choosing their leaders.

'I am doing nothing but staring at 
the television before Obama gets re-elected. As for China's party 
congress, there is no need for me to worry. On the contrary, it would be
a waste of my time,' Xu Xiaoping, a celebrity entrepreneur who 
co-founded a successful chain of English language cram schools, said on a
Chinese version of Twitter where he has six million followers.

To
many Chinese, China is at an inflection point. Its old model of heavily
state-directed growth that lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty 
and made China an economic powerhouse is sputtering in the face of 
rising domestic debt and a weak global economy.

Meanwhile, the government has to contend with the public's continued expectations of higher living standards and for less corruption and greater accountability, if not outright democracy.

In Tiananmen Square, adjacent to the congress venue, a woman in her 30s threw pieces of torn paper into the air and shouted 'bandits and robbers!' in the early morning before she was taken away by security forces.

On the eve of the congress, four ethnic Tibetans in Sichuan province set themselves on fire in protests against Chinese rule of Tibetan areas, London-based rights group Free Tibet said, adding that the timing of the protests appeared aimed at sending a signal to the Chinese leadership.
