The locks are being removed from thousands of supermarket trolleys in a move designed to take the fuss out of shopping.

The security devices became part of the everyday experience of supermarket shopping more than 20 years ago, amid a rise in thefts because of their scrap value.

However, Morrisons believes that the introduction of sophisticated CCTV systems, coupled with barriers and bollards designed to stop them being taken off site can provide sufficient protection.

Soon to be a thing of the past: Morrisons are removing the locks from 150,000 of their trolleys to make shopping easier and quicker for their customers

Currently, customers need a £1 coin or token to operate the locks, before wrestling the trolley free and then do a tour of the store.

However, company bosses say that people find them difficult and inconvenient to use, while many do not have the right change, which is enormously frustrating.

The locks will come off 150,000 trolleys at some 279 mainstream outlets, however they will remain at some 228 sites - either in city centre sites which are a particular crime risk or sites in hilly locations where there is a danger they will roll away.

The supermarket’s research found that 43per cent of customers find trolley locks inconvenient, while more than one in four – 27per cent - do not always have the right change.

Dalton Philips, the Chief executive, said: ‘Our nation is getting busier. We have less free time than previous generations and customers have told us that they want a quicker shop.

‘The removal of trolley locks is just one of the many improvements we are making to our store – to make for a faster and easier shopping trip.’

A spokesman added: ‘We are putting our trust in the public and hoping people will not take them. Where trolleys are abandoned, we are asking customers to let us know so that we can collect them.’ 

Shoppers have been turning away from the big box outlets of all the major supermarkets because the idea of spending precious hours at the weekend touring the soul-less aisles has become too much of a chore.

The move by Morrisons is part of a scheme to make it a more pleasant experience, which also includes extending opening hours, redesigning 277 outlets, refurbishing store cafés, lavatories and baby changing areas, and building new petrol stations.

Other stores are making the own efforts to improve the appeal of the bigger superstores. Tesco, for example, has introduced outlets of the family restaurant chain Giraffe and the Harris + Hoole coffee shops.

The trolleys are expensive to buy because they contain aluminium, which means they also have a good scrap value for thieves. 

Twenty years ago, around 100,000 trolleys were stolen from supermarkets across the UK every year, however the figure has fallen sharply following the introduction of locks and other security measures.

Apart from the cost and inconvenience of constantly needing to replace the trolleys, which can cost more than £80 each, stores can also be prosecuted for allowing them to be abandoned.

A few years ago, Tesco ran a trial which involved placing a spy chip in the trolleys which meant that if a customer tried to take them off site, the rear wheels would be triggered to automatically lock.
