A gang of robbers stole £1million of jewellery then set a trail of small fires and strung wire ropes along their escape route to distract police.

The raiders plundered Leslie Davis in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, at 3am before laying a path of destruction to evade arrest.

Thames Valley Police were alerted to the scene by burglar alarms but arrived to find the gates of the  shopping centre padlocked shut.

A gang of thieves raided Leslie Davis in Milton Keynes at 3am this morning before setting a trail of small fires in litter bins to distract police while they escaped 

Their pursuit was also hindered by thick, wire ropes strung across roads and small fires set in bins on approach to the shop.

The thieves, who stole £1million worth of gold, silver and diamonds, escaped and have not yet been found.  

'This burglary was carried out by offenders who used planned distraction and deterring tactics to delay officers attending the scene,'  a Thames Valley Police spokesman said. 

'These included setting small fires nearby as well as using metal ropes to prevent vehicular access and padlocking entry gates. 

Forensics experts were scouring the store in Milton Keynes this morning for traces of the raiders 

Smashes glass is scattered across the floor at the store. An estimated £1million of gold, silver and diamonds was stolen in the raid 

'We are currently undertaking extensive forensic work in and around the location of the burglary, meaning that disruption to traffic, particularly access across the over-bridge to the centre of Milton Keynes, is unavoidable.

'I would ask the public for their patience while we carry out this necessary part of our investigation.' 

It is not known how many people were involved in the raid or whether a vehicle was used in their escape.
