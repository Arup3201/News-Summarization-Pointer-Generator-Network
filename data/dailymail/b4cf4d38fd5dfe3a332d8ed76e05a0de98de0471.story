As far as hat-tricks go, they don't get much better than this.

Teenager Kevin Libertowski nets a basketball in his back garden in Cleveland, Ohio no less than three times by performing a back-flip in a variety of positions.

First up, a pal throws the basketball at the 17-year-old's feet and he times it just right to back-flip, kick the ball, then score.

Next, the teen bounces on a trampoline with the ball between his feet before flipping over and hurling it straight into the net.

And last up, Kevin takes a run at the net, back-flips with the ball in his hand, shoots, then scores.

The trampoline trick shot went viral last year and has attracted more than 200,000 hits along with 7,000 subscribers who tune into KDP Productions to see his skilful shots.

High school student Kevin said: 'I started developing my acrobatic skills by teaching myself a variety of flips and moves on the trampoline.

'Then once I had mastered that trick, I'd do them on the ground.

'After doing thousands of flips, it was quite easy to start incorporating basketball shots into them.

Kevin Libertowski, 17, from Ohio, shows of his skills as he nets this ball while doing a back-flip

'My first video got hundreds of thousands of views, so I decided to make more videos of other shots just like it.' 

Kevin says it takes two days to create each video and get the shot right exactly right.

He said: 'First I have to come up with the idea, then make sure it is actually possible to do.

'Then I have to practice the flip enough so that I actually feel comfortable doing it with a ball in my hands or feet and feel confident enough to make the shot.

'Then we have to film it which can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how the shot goes. On average around an hour in a half to make the trickiest shots.'
