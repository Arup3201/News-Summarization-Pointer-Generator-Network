Samuel Eto'o is out of Cameroon's second Group A match against Croatia on Wednesday night after the striker confirmed his knee injury will keep him sidelined.

The Chelsea striker took to Twitter to tell of the news, and it means Cameroon's all-time top goalscorer will not be able to help them bounce back from their 1-0 loss to Mexico in their World Cup opener.

Eto'o wrote: 'The doctors confirm! I would probably not be able to play the match vs Croatia on Wed June 18th due to an injury on my knee causing me pain.'

Confirmed: Eto'o took to Twitter to tell of the news that he will not play in Cameroon's second Group A game

Cameroon coach Volker Finke admitted Eto'o missed two days of training due to an injury, and it seems the ex-Barcelona forward will not be able to recover in time.

Finke said: 'He has a problem with the right knee that he already had at the end of the season with his club Chelsea.

'He did not train yesterday nor today.'

Eto'o may be out of the game in Manaus but there remains hope he will return for their final group game against host nation, Brazil.

The 33-year-old is sure to be missed, given the pivotal he has played in the Cameroon team over the past decade.
