She has already told a court how Chris Huhne forced her to have an abortion for the sake of his career.

But yesterday Vicky Pryce revealed to a trial that the disgraced former Lib Dem MP tried to make her terminate another pregnancy two years later.

Mrs Pryce, 60, said she was booked in to have an abortion but now had the strength to resist her husband and refused to go at the very last moment.

Loving mother: Vicky Pryce revealed that Chris Huhen tried tried to make her terminate a second pregnancy in 1992. She went on to tell Southwark Crown Court that she later gave birth to 'wonderful' son, Peter (pictured together)

Giving
evidence at her trial for perverting the course of justice, she told 
Southwark Crown Court that she later gave birth to a ‘wonderful’ son, 
Peter.

Former top Government economic adviser Pryce already had four other children, two with Huhne and two from her first marriage.

Earlier in the week, she said Huhne told her to end a pregnancy in 1990 because it was ‘bad timing’ for his professional future.

Yesterday,
Pryce said Huhne demanded she have another abortion in 1992, but she 
said she abandoned the plan at the ‘very last minute’.

She
said: ‘The same argument ensued, it was all booked and I was meant to 
go that morning. I woke up and knew how I had felt about the previous 
one and knew I couldn’t do it.

‘It was the experience of the previous one that actually allowed me to do that but it was only on the day itself.’

Bad timing: Mrs Pryce earlier told the court that Huhne told her to end a pregnancy in 1990 because it was ¿bad timing¿ for his professional future

She
added: ‘I just could not bring myself to it and I knew from the 
previous one how unhappy I would be. I was nonetheless pushed to the 
brink.’ Pryce took the stand for a second day in her trial for taking 
speeding points on behalf of her ex-husband in 2003.

Huhne faces prison and his political career is over after he pleaded guilty on Monday.

The story of the speeding points emerged in the Press after Huhne left Pryce for his aide and lover Carina Trimingham in 2010.

Earlier
this week it emerged that son Peter, who was born in 1992, was involved
in an angry exchange of text messages with his father after the 
break-up. In the emails shown to the court, Peter describes his father 
as a ‘fat piece of ****’ and tells him: ‘I hate you, so **** off’.

In cross-examination on the abandoned abortion, prosecutor Andrew Edis asked: ‘However, he [Huhne] loved that child didn’t he?’

Referring to Peter, Pryce replied: ‘Of course. He’s wonderful. It is difficult not to.’

Mr Edis said: ‘You got your way.’

Pryce
replied: ‘Got your way is going too far. I managed to resist it because
I would not get into a car and be taken to a place and get it done.’

Pryce
admits her involvement in taking speeding points but claims she is not 
guilty under the defence of marital coercion, meaning Huhne forced her 
to act.

Mr Edis questioned whether she was really coerced by her husband, saying ‘very clever people sometimes do silly things’.

He accused Pryce of lying over her dealings with the Press as she tried to make the story of his deception public.

In
an often testy exchange, he said that far from putting her ‘family 
first’, the whole ‘catastrophe’ they faced was due to her actions.

Mr Edis highlighted how helping Huhne keep his licence in 2003 actually benefited them both.

It
meant Huhne was more likely to win a seat as an MP and return to 
Britain from his job as an MEP, which she opposed from the start. It 
also meant she did not have to spend six months driving him around 
during his inevitable ban.

Mr
Edis said: ‘The reality is Mrs Pryce, of all the women who are 
pressured by their husband you were in the best possible position to 
resist and do the right thing.’

Pryce replied that it was ‘terrible times’ and she had to ‘keep the show on the road’ with a husband ‘who was never there’.

Pryce admitted briefing a journalist about two damaging stories after her husband left her in 2010 for Miss Trimingham.

One was about how Huhne introduced Miss Trimingham to the Queen. The second involved her throwing his clothes from the house.

Pryce
insisted she did not realise the speeding points story would ‘bring 
down’ her husband and said she thought he would tough it out.

Asked
if she wanted to ruin him, she said she could have done it ‘quite 
easily’ and it is possible she said ‘worse things’ about him.

She said: ‘If I really wanted to inflict fatal damage on him I could have done something very, very different.’

Pryce added: ‘You know what goes on in politics, integrity was not necessarily a very valued quality.’

The
jury was told Pryce has been given references by former head of MI6 Sir
John Scarlett and former senior civil servant Sir John Gieve.

A
colleague from Good Corporation, the company Pryce set up to encourage 
ethical behaviour in industry, said he had ‘no reservations’ about her 
integrity.

When told she 
earned £110,000 while working for the Department for Trade and Industry,
Pryce replied: ‘I was actually earning a bit more than that.’

She
said a newspaper interview quoting her as wanting to be Chancellor of 
the Exchequer was a joke. The case continues on Monday.
