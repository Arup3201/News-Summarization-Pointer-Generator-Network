Thousands of NHS patients are being forced to wait weeks for vital cancer tests – potentially putting their lives at risk.

The NHS recommends that no one should wait longer than six weeks after being referred by their GP for a diagnostic test.

But the latest official figures show that in April, almost 17,000 patients waited longer than the limit – more than double the total in the same month last year and almost five times the figure at the time of the last election in 2010.

The number is also the highest for six years, suggesting that progress made in recent years to tackle the problem has stalled.

It comes just two weeks after official figures revealed that the target of 85 per cent of cancer patients starting treatment within two months of a GP referral has not been met for the first time since 2009.

The latest total of 16,981 patients includes 3,427 waiting more than six weeks for endoscopy tests that detect bowel and stomach cancers – up from 2,037 last April, and 976 in 2010.

There were 6,117 patients waiting for ultrasound tests, up from 1,326 last year, and 291 at the election.

Some 2,439 waited too long for MRI scans, compared with 374 at the election, and 859 were kept waiting for CT scans, compared with 215 in 2010.

Charities blamed short staffing and a lack of MRI and CT machines for the problems. Sara Osborne, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘These latest figures are extremely worrying and urgent action must be taken to make sure patients don’t have to wait too long to get their cancer diagnosed.

‘The six-week waiting time target is in place as we know a quick diagnosis of cancer and access to treatment is vital to improving survival from the disease.

'Patients need assurance that suspected cancer is taken seriously and prioritised by the NHS.’

Ciaran Devane, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Only two weeks ago we heard that more people are waiting longer to start treatment and now more people are waiting longer just to get diagnosed.

'Once again we see that cancer care in this country isn’t fixed. The NHS is under strain and cancer risks being overlooked and not given the focus it needs.’

Last night the Department of Health announced that an extra £250million was being given to hospitals and GP-led organisations to keep waiting times down.

It follows figures showing that an extra 250,000 patients are waiting for planned surgery or treatment compared to this time last year.

The department said the increase was partly due to the ageing population, which means more patients are being referred by GPs.
