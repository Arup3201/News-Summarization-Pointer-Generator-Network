A charity fundraiser has been charged with pocketing more than £560,000 meant for the Help for Heroes charity.

Christopher Copeland, 51, will appear in court next month accused of 15 counts of fraud by false representation and one offence under the Proceeds of Crime Act in connection with the armed forces charity.

Copeland, from Copplestone, Devon, is alleged to have employed teams of collectors at supermarkets and in town centres across the country.

It is alleged that between April 2009 and September 2011 he 'concealed criminal property, namely £518,397 in cash' by depositing the cash into his business accounts.

He is also accused of keeping £42,711 donated by the public in supermarkets and high street collections, The Sun has reported.

Bryn and Emma Parry, co-founders of Help For Heroes, said: 'Help For Heroes is aware of the offences alleged to have been committed by Mr Copeland.

'We have been working closely with the police and we take a firm stance whenever it appears that funds may have been diverted dishonestly from the men and women whose lives we are helping to rebuild.

'We take action to recover any misappropriated funds and to ensure that those accused of dishonesty are held to account.

'The Great British public have shown amazing support since Help for Heroes was set up in 2007.'

Garage owner Copeland was charged by Devon and Cornwall Police and will appear before Exeter Magistrates Court on May 8.

The 16 charges, alleged to have been committed between September 2009 and July 2011, follow an 18 month long police inquiry.
