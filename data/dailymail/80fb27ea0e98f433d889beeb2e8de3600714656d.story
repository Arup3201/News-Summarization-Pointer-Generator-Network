Now home to shrimps, tropical fish and the odd baracuda, a World War Two warplane lies covered in algae, resting on the sea bed.The Douglas Dakota DC-3, which was used as a transporter by a Turkish paratroop regiment in World War Two, today sits at the bottom of the Mediterranean - its twin propeller engines now rusted and covered in coral.The plane, which is 21 metres beneath the surface, was deliberately sunk in waters of Cas, Turkey, in July 2009 to create an underwater playground for divers.

Ghost of the deep: A free-diver swims next to a sunken WWII DC-3 aircraft off the coast of Turkey

Attraction: The historic aircraft was deliberately sunk in waters off Cas, in Turkey, to create an underground playground for divers

A piece of history: A free-diver grabs hold of one of the propellers of the sunken DC-3 aircraft 21 metres under water

The submerged aircraft is now home to schools of tropical fish. Shrimp gobies live in the cool sand in the shadow of the plane and barracudas drift past the wings in search of food.

Underwater photographer Andrey Nekrasov, 42, dived the wreck. He entered the sunken aircraft through the large door in the main hull, which was once used as the main exit for jumping paratroopers. He said: 'We went on a diving boat to a small island. Directly below us lay the plane - its blurred outlines were visible on the surface of the water.'The plane was so well preserved, it looked as it were resting on an airfield runway. It looked unusual and beautiful.'

Group shot: The freedivers pose for a picture above the sunken  WWII aircraft. It took some of them several attempts until they could hold their breath for long enough to reach the site

In touch with the past: A freediver touches the roof of the DC3's cockpit. It was one of the most successful airplane models of its time and around 13,000 DC-3s were built before production ended in 1945

Underwater photographer Andrey Nekrasov, said: 'The plane was so well preserved, it looked as it were resting on an airfield runway. It looked unusual and beautiful'

Mr Nekrasov, from Odessa in Ukraine, and a group of divers from Russia explored the almost perfectly preserved wreckage using no breathing apparatus.Divers wore full face masks and wetsuits, resurfacing every two minutes to breathe. Mr Neskarov said: 'Not all free divers were able to reach the plane on their first try.'But once everyone in the group had managed to reach the plane we decided to take a group picture. Towards the end of the dive I was able to hold my breath long enough to look inside the cabin.'

War horse: The Douglas Dakota DC-3 which was used as a transporter by a Turkish paratroop regiment in World War II

The last DC-3 was built in 1945. Some models are still flying as cargo aircraft in developing countries such as Bolivia and Tonga

The very first Douglas DC-3 took off in 
1935. It was one of the most successful airplane models of its time and 
around 13,000 DC-3s were built.

The military variant used by Allied forces was designated the C-47 Skytrain, of which more than 10,000 were produced.
