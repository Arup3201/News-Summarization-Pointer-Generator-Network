Danny Ings has flown to Spain to hold talks with David Moyes ahead of a possible move to Real Sociedad this summer.

The Burnley striker, who has also been strongly linked to Liverpool, is weighing up the pros and cons of a switch to La Liga.

Moyes, the former Everton and Manchester United manager, is an admirer of Ings, 22, who has nine goals this season for the Clarets.

The England under 21 international was excellent on Wednesday night in Burnley's 3-1 defeat to United at Old Trafford, getting on the scoresheet in the 12th minute.

Moyes was appointed Sociedad manager in November last year and with them currently 11th in the table is starting to think about additions to his squad.

The Scot would be wise to tie down a deal as soon as possible with Ings' stock set to rise even further with a likely call-up to the England senior squad in the coming months.
