Battered, covered in rust and long overdue a service, this Mini might not look like much - but it could soon fetch £10,000 at auction.

The old banger, which has spent the past 40 years rusting away in a barn, is a 1959 Morris Mini Minor Saloon - the 15th oldest-surviving Mini in the world.

It was purchased by its owner 54 years ago but he locked it away a few years later following a crash which badly damaged the front of the vehicle.

This knackered car, which has spent the past 40 years rusting away in a barn, is a 1959 Morris Mini Minor Saloon - the 15th oldest-surviving Mini in the world

It was purchased by its unidentified owner 54 years ago but he locked it away a few years later following a crash which badly damaged the front of the vehicle

The car, which was the 529th of its type ever built, has just under 47,000 miles on the clock

Although he had every intention of repairing the vehicle, which was originally cherry red but was painted blue, it has remained in his barn ever since.

It only came to light last month when his family decided to do a clear-out following the death of the unidentified owner who was from Bicester in Oxfordshire.

The car, which was the 529th of its type ever built, comes with its original engine and has just under 47,000 miles on the clock.

British Motor Corporation (BMC) marketed the car as the 'Austin Se7en' and 'Morris Mini Minor' before 'Mini' became a marque name in its own right in 1969.

Found during a clear-out in Bicester, Oxfordshire, the vehicle also comes with its original engine

This car will be sold by Bonhams next month and experts believe it will be an extremely popular item with Mini enthusiasts looking for a restoration project

Two years ago, the eighth oldest-surviving Mini was sold for £40,000 at auction.

This car will be sold by Bonhams next month and experts believe it will be an extremely popular item with Mini enthusiasts looking for a restoration project.

The car will appeal to somebody who fancies a bit of a challenge

Rob Hubbard, senior specialist at the Bonhams motor car department, said: 'It is one of the oldest surviving Mini cars and that in itself makes this one special.

'It was put into the barn after a minor prang and has been there ever since.

'The owner's children finally got round to sorting out the old barn and found this.

'It is a nice, original example, with a proper engine.

'The car will appeal to somebody who fancies a bit of a challenge and who is looking for a good restoration project to get involved with.

'It represents a wonderful opportunity to acquire an example of one of the 20th century's greatest cars in its earliest and and purest form.

'In its day, the Mini was a trendsetter and it revolutionised the motoring industry in Great Britain in the 1960s.

'Even today, over 50 years later, people are still obsessed by the cars.'

The 1959 Morris Mini will be auctioned by Bonhams at Oxford on March 2.

Sir Alec Issigonis was superb at repackaging ideas, making cars smaller and more efficient, and that fed into his greatest triumph, the most iconic British car ever - the Mini

The son of an Anglophile 
Greek, Sir Alec Issigonis came out of that post-World War II generation that 
believed they could make anything.

He pioneered independent suspension, 
moved the engine and gearbox together and was instrumental in making 
front-wheel drive the industry standard.

His first major project was the
Morris Minor, which demonstrated his ability to create cars with mass 
appeal  -  the Minor lasted for 20 years.

He was superb at repackaging 
ideas, making cars smaller and more efficient, and that fed into his 
greatest triumph, the most iconic British car ever  -  the Mini.

This 
led to a whole range of cars, including the Morris 1100 and 1800  -  an 
innovation in itself at the time.      

In the mid-1960s, more than 5,000 Minis were being built every week.             Dale Harrow
