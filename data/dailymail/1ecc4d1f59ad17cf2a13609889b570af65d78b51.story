The billionaire father of Linda Evangelista's baby wanted her to abort their son, her lawyer has claimed as the supermodel meets her former boyfriend in court over childcare support.

And taking the stand, François-Henri Pinault admitted he had broken up with the supermodel after discovering she was pregnant four months into their relationship. 'I didn't even know 
her,' he said.

The bitter trial, which kicked off on Thursday and is expected to last four days, is set to spell out the childcare obligations of Pinault, who is now married to Hollywood actress Salma Hayek.

Evangelista gave birth to their son Augie, now five, after her short relationship with Pinault, and has claimed in the run-up to the trial that she wants a staggering $46,000 a month for his care.

Battle: Evangelista has previously said she wants $46,000 a month in child support for the five-year-old

She claimed the vast sum is to cover the youngster's around-the-clock nanny, at a cost of $7,000 a month, and armed drivers, costing as much as $16,000 a month, the New York Post reported.

Pinault had criticised Evangelista for her outlandish demands, suggesting the money was in fact for 'mom support'; she maintained she was modelling or working on her image at all hours of the day.

In a move that shows they are readying for a bitter feud, Evangelista's lawyer William Beslow recounted a conversation the former couple shared in January 2006.

'After some initial happiness, he told her he wished she would terminate the pregnancy,' Beslow told a support magistrate.

Evangelista, who was then in her early 40s, told Pinault she would keep the baby, the Post reported.

'She would support the child herself, since he had made it perfectly clear to her that he had no interest in doing so. And she did.'

Arriving at court, Evangelista, 46, looked ready for business, dressed in a smart floral-print shirt, knee-length black skirt and sunglasses, with her hair cut into a sleek bob.

Pinault, who began dating Hayak while Evangelista was pregnant, watched his former girlfriend with a bemused smile, the Post reported.

As he took the witness stand, Pinault said he found out she was pregnant in early 2006 and admitted he broke up with her on hearing the news.

'She was so happy to be pregnant,' he said. 'But it was not planned. I decided to stop the relationship at that point.'

He added: 'We were dating four months and I didn't even know her very much.'

He went on to say he believed she had intentionally become pregnant and that he had no part in deciding whether she should keep the baby or not.

He added: 'I told her I would recognize the baby, which I did. I would take my responsibility and I did.'

Asked why he didn’t pay Evangelista anything in child support for the first years of Augie's life, Pinault answered: 'She didn’t ask and I didn’t offer.'

The 49-year-old is chief executive of PPR, 
the conglomerate that owns Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Bottega Veneta. He has an annual income is heir to an $11.5 billion family estate.

In opening statements on 
Thursday, Beslow insisted Evangelista is not hoping to improve her 
station in life but that she has paid all of his expenses without a 
single cent from Pinault.

'Ms.
Evangelista is not looking to piggyback on the lifestyle of Mr. 
Pinault,' Beslow added. 'She is looking for a continuation of the 
reasonable lifestyle of Augie.'

Happier times: Evangelista dated French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault for four months at the end of 2005

Unhappy ending: Evangelista was excited about her pregnancy, while Pinault was not, he said in court

Pinault's
lawyer, David Aronson, argued that his client had repeatedly reach out 
to Evangelista's prior lawyers about child support payments, only to be 
met with silence.

He added: 'Most of the expenses do not relate to Augie but they relate to Ms. Evangelista.'

He
continued: 'These people have more money than a lot of people. But our 
position is that what we understand is being asked for is just 
ridiculous.'

Evangelista is
due to testify in the trial tomorrow. If she is granted the $46,000 of 
her demands, it will shatter records for childcare payouts.

'I need to protect him,' Evangelista told Love magazine in February.

Last year a judge questioned the model's need for full-time nannies, asking how often she worked.

'When I work, it can be a 16-hour 
day,' she said. 'On days when I do not work, I am 
working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I
have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an 
athlete.'

Moving on: Pinault began dating Salma Hayek, left, when Evangelista was pregnant. Evangelista says her son should get the same trust fund as Hayek and Pinault's daughter Valentina, right

Evangelista, herself worth $8 million, is also demanding Pinault give her
son a home similar to the $13 million California mansion he put in a 
trust for his and Hayek's four-year-old daughter, Valentina.

His family estate includes the 
Christie’s auction house, the Château-Latour vineyard in Bordeaux and 
the French premiere league football team Stade Rennais, the Daily News 
reported.

Earlier this week, Manhattan divorce lawyer Raoul Felder
said the eye-watering payout - which comes to $1,500 a day - was unlikely.

He pointed out that judges 
consider how much it costs to care for a child, rather than the wealth 
of the parents.

'She’s in for a big surprise. I wouldn’t be counting the money yet,' he told the New York Daily News.

She is worth $8 million and owns a 
penthouse in the desirable Chelsea, New York and an apartment near her 
son’s school on the upper East Side.

Demands: Evangelista is not so hard up herself, earning millions from high-profile modelling campaigns, cosmetic contracts and cover shoots

She
broke up with billionaire and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton 
last year and filed her case against Pinault shortly after the break up.

Since, Pinault has been paying child support - although the amount has not been disclosed.

The couple dated from 
September 2005 until January 2006, and she was pregnant with Augie when 
Pinault began dating Hayek in April 2006. He and Hayek married in 2009.

Evangelista had kept the name of Augie's father secret until it was written in court papers filed in August.
