The writer of the Inspector Morse detective novels admired actor John Thaw's performance as the curmudgeonly detective so much he has written a clause into his will banning other actors from playing the part after he dies.

Colin Dexter, 83, created the popular character in 1975 and the novels were adapted into TV series Inspector Morse that ran from 1987 to 2000 with Thaw, who died in 2002, in the lead role.

Mr Dexter said: 'We never want to repeat what John has done.'

'A lot of people connected with Morse didn't want anyone coming along to say we will try and outdo dear old John.

'I said I'm not ever going to allow that, full stop,' he told The Independent.

The clause was revealed in a Radio Times interview with actor Shaun Evans.

Evans, 34, plays the younger version of the character in Endeavour, a prequel that gets its title from the detective's unusual first name.

The ITV drama, penned as a prequel to the
 long-running TV series, made its debut with a 
feature-length special in 2012 and has spawned two series.

The series was only made possible thanks to the determination of the executive producer, who took four years to convince Mr Dexter to allow it.

Mr Evans said: 'I know that the creator, Colin Dexter, has it in his will that no one else can play the part, which is as it should be.

'It's not something that can go on and on. I really don't think it will.'

Mr Evans has told how he looked to 
comedian Michael Palin for inspiration when it came to playing the young
 Morse - and also suggested that he could call time on the famous 
character.

Asked whether viewers can expect to see the drama move into the 1970s, Evans replied: 'Listen, never say never. It would be a great life for me, I suppose. But is it something you'd want, creatively?

'I'm not so sure.'

He said that instead of turning to recordings of Thaw and attempting to impersonate the popular actor, he looked for inspiration elsewhere.

'I listened a lot to Michael Palin, who was from the north, went to Oxford and who was alive at that time. That's how I imagine Morse's voice to be,' he said.

Lewis is a spin-off from Inspector Morse. Like that series, it was set primarily in Oxford, Oxfordshire.

Kevin Whately reprised his character Robert 'Robbie' Lewis, who had been Morse's sergeant and loyal friend in the original series.

Lewis had now been promoted to detective inspector and is assisted by DS James Hathaway, portrayed by Laurence Fox.

He also read Dexter's novels, where the character is more lecherous than he was in Inspector Morse.

'The more we can introduce of that, the better,' he told the magazine.

'I'm always fighting to make that a reality, without him becoming this full-on seedy, depraved character, of course.

'What you don't want is for it to be sanitised and pasteurised, which a lot of stuff is nowadays.'

Evans said that Scandinavian crime dramas such as The Killing and The Bridge had also left their mark on Endeavour.

'Audiences want a certain darkness now and you have to pay attention to that. There's no denying that this character is a bit of a loner and slightly out of joint with his time and place.

'That's what I find endearing about him. And perhaps the audience does, too,' he said.

Evans added: 'The world doesn't need another detective series, so we have to do something different with it.

'If you're going to do a show that has already had a long life, you have to grab it and do something new. So that's what we attempted and I feel we've largely succeeded.'

Inspector Morse also inspired the spin-off ITV detective series Lewis, starring Kevin Whately, who played Chief Inspector Morse's sidekick in the original sleuth drama.

Morse is as a senior CID officer with 
the Thames Valley Police force in Oxford. He famously drives a 
Jaguar, likes real ale and enjoys opera, poetry and art.

He
 first appeared in the 1975 book Last Bus To Woodstock and made his TV 
debut in Inspector Morse, portrayed by John Thaw, in 1987.

There are 13 books in total, and author Colin Dexter has also written short stories about the gruff-yet-likeable police officer.

Actor John
 Thaw played the part until 2000. At its peak, the the series attracted 
more than 18 million viewers in the UK, and the show was sold to some 200 countries.

The
 character died from a heart attack in, The 
Remorseful Day, published in 1999. He died on-screen in 2000. Thaw died 
two years later.

The 
character was resurrected in 2012 by actor Shaun Evans, who plays Morse 
at the beginning of his police career in prequel 
Endeavour, set in the 1960s.
