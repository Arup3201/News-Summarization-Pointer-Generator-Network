Police have discovered a mother and son who were found dead with gunshot wounds.

The devoted mother, named locally as Maureen Tyler, has been described today by neighbours as 'extremely  loving and very kind.'

Mrs Tyler's son, also named locally as Mark, was also found dead at the property on a private lane less than a mile from the infamous Dale Farm travellers' site.

Officers were called after the pair - found in a house in Pitsea View Road, Crays Hill, Essex, last night - had not been seen for several days.

Double murder: Police arrive at the scene where the grisly discovery was made

Forensic officers arrive on the scene to inspect the home where the mother and son had lain undiscovered for days

At around 8pm last night detectives 
confirmed they had found the bodies of a man in his thirties and a woman
in her late seventies, who had lain there for days.

Mrs Tyler's small pink bungalow called 'Maybe' is now surrounded by police tape and a cordon has been placed at the end of the private road.

It emerged today that Mrs Tyler had been caring for her cancer-stricken husband before his death earlier this year.

One neighbour of the family said that Mark had been a heroin addict and others described him as a 'fitness fanatic' who would keep them awake into the small hours as he lifted heavy weights.

One said: 'He was totally obsessed with fitness and we could hear him lifting weights in the middle of the night. 

'But you would never see him in the day though.'

Police forensic officers in white suits have been going in and out of the home all morning.

Neighbours have today spoken of their fears that something terrible would befall Mrs Tyler who police have said was in her 70s.

Scene of the deaths: The bodies were found at a home in Pitsea View Road

Linda Starling, whose property backs onto the murder home, described the pensioner as 'a loving mother who was very, very kind.'

An Essex Police spokesman said the deaths were being treated as suspicious.

He added: 'At this time, police are 
not seeking anyone else in connection with this incident, however a 
detailed forensic examination will be taking place to establish the 
exact circumstances of both deaths.'

Both had died from gun shot wounds at the home which is less than a mile away from the Dale Farm travellers' site.

Senior
investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Mark Hall said: 'We are
investigating the circumstances leading up to the deaths of these two 
people, who have not been formally identified, but we believe them to be
mother and son.

'We believe that they may have been dead for some days and need to speak to anyone who has been in the area of Pitsea View Road recently and has any information that can help us with our inquiries.'

Essex Police said detectives were not looking for anybody else in connection with the incident.

A detailed forensic examination is being carried out to establish the circumstances of both deaths.
