A 17-year-old Maryland honors student destined for Harvard University was shot to death in her own bed after a home invasion.

Stanley's 37-year-old sister and her small daughter, as well as a 17-year-old foster sister, were at home when the shooting happened but were not harmed during the attack and now police are canvasing the area for leads in their search for the shooter.

Amber Stanley was shot multiple times while she in her bed after a male suspect kicked down the door to her Kettering, Maryland home

An honours student at Charles H. Flowers High School, who dreamed of being a doctor, Stanley's death came as a shock to her fellow students and teachers.

'She was without question the child who was going to lead us successfully into the 21st century,' said school principal Gorman Brown.

'She had the grades, SAT scores and the attitude to attend any college in this country and succeed.

'She was a very affable young lady

'Students loved her; teachers loved her. She was very active in our school community.

The popular teenager was studying to attend Harvard University where she hoped to enroll in medicine

Amber Stanley was at home in her bedroom in Kettering, Maryland when a man burst into her home and shot her multiple times

'Students came up and told stories of Amber and how she was an affable 
child with an infectious smile. And she will be missed by all a great 
deal.'

Police said a man entered the home, shot Stanley in her bedroom, and then left the house without injuring anyone else.

'The investigation is ongoing,' said Cpl. Larry Johnson with the Prince 
George's County Police Department. 

'Still looking for a suspect, still 
looking for a motive.  If anyone has information, seen anything 
suspicious in the neighborhood, please provide that information to the 
police department.'

The young lady's body was removed from her home at around 6 a.m. on Thursday just as her visibly distraught mother arrived back home to see her daughter being loaded into the back of an ambulance.

Police spokesman Cpl. Larry Johnson said to the Washington Times that officers went to Amber’s home on August 17th to investigate a report of an assault.

No arrests were made in that case, and no further details about the incident were immediately available.

Neighbours spoke of their shock at the murder of the quiet and popular Stanley

Police have said that they are not in a position to say whether the reported assault and the death of Stanley are connected.

Neighbors reported to MyFox in Washington D.C. that there had been increased traffic on Chartsey Street lately where Stanley lived with her mother, sister and a foster child.

'Lots of young people, sitting in cars,' said neighbor Tyrone Patterson. 

Charles H. Flowers High School principal Gorman Brown said that the entire community was devastated by Stanley's death

'That's unusual for this neighborhood. It's always been quiet. We need to be vigilant to make sure everyone is safe.'

Police detectives are offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of any suspects of the high achieving student.

'I've been here 32 years. I raised two kids here. It's devastating to have something like this happen on your street,' said Patterson.

Her school issued a statement today to express their sorrow at the death of the teenager.

'The Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS) community is tremendously saddened by the death of Charles Herbert Flowers High School honors student Amber Stanley,' said the statement,

'This young girl had a bright future ahead of her with dreams to pursue and goals to reach.

'We condemn the senseless act of violence that took her life and hope that law enforcement officials will quickly bring those responsible to justice.

'On behalf of our school system family, we extend our deepest sympathies to all who loved Amber and pray that your memories bring you comfort in this time of grief.'
