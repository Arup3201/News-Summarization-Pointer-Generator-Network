SADDLE up, marine!

Because this is looking like the game fans of the films have been waiting for – a true sequel to James Cameron's 1986 masterpiece, Aliens.

Knock, knock: An alien lurks behind an unsuspecting, and soon to be dead, grunt

Aliens: Colonial Marines is told through the eyes of Corporal Christopher Winter. A group of grunts are sent to investigate the USS Sulaco in search of Ellen Ripley, Corporal Dwayne Hicks and the rest of the missing soldiers who were dispatched to LV-426.

Using authentic environments inspired by the films, including Hadley’s Hope itself, the game promises to immerse you in the eerie, claustrophobic world that made the film series such a blockbuster success.

First off, it’s clear the game is in safe hands as Gearbox, the team behind the critically acclaimed Borderlands and Brothers in Arms games, are behind the wheel.

Having seen the game in action, it looks superb – leaps and bounds above the average-at-best first-person blooper shooter, Aliens Vs Predator.

Lighting, as predicted, is the star of the show – creating the oppressive, nerve-shredding atmosphere Aliens fans have long waited for.

Erm, I've found something! You'll fight some old foes

We watched as the marines did a ‘sweep’ of Hadley’s Hope - the frayed wires and twisted metal are all that remains of what was once a place where families lived.

Stagnant water dripped from exposed pipes as the soldiers meandered their way through the dark, bitterly cold metal maze.

It was only a matter of time before their motion trackers registered movement - the haunting 'beep' stopping the patrol in their tracks.

And then they came - dragging one grunt face-first through a vent - his blood-curdling echo cut ruthlessly short with an almighty thud.

Aliens burst from every crack and cranny - their terrifying 'hisses' drowning out the high-pitched blasts from the solders' pulse rifles.

The aliens’ animations are superb. They crawl and scamper over walls and ceilings before diving at you ferociously.

There was even a brief introduction to a new breed of alien – a huge beast that chases after you – leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.

Thankfully, you’ll be armed to the teeth, tooled up with all the classic marine weapons.

And when things get too hectic, you can call in your friends. The whole campaign can be played with a squad of up to four players, dropping in and out as necessary through self-contained missions within an over-arching narrative.

There’s also an extensive upgrade system that allows players to customise their characters to play the way they want.

You can earn experience to get perks, new weapons and new looks for your squad.

However, the bad news is that it’s just been delayed…again. So, don’t expect to get your hands on a copy until February next year.

They're coming out the walls! If things get tough, call in your friends at any time

Also, for current gen owners, there are hints that the next gen Wii U version will look the best, begging the question: is this the beginning of the end for current gen?

If it is, then what better game to send them off.
