X Factor finalist Rylan Clark has spoken out about his mother’s 30-year battle with crippling Crohn’s disease.

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the Celebrity Big Brother 2013 winner said that his mother’s illness had not only affected her but himself too, admitting that it impacted on his childhood and that he continues to worry about the state of her health today.

Rylan said that unlike other mothers, Linda Clark, 60, was unable to go on school trips with him. He added that she was sometimes so embarrassed about the symptoms of her disease that he was not allowed to invite friends to stay at his home for sleepovers.

Rylan's mother, Linda Clark, 60 (left), was diagnosed with severe Crohn's disease when she was in her 30s

He said: ‘My mum lost her job because of the disease – it totally dictates her life.

‘When she was diagnosed it really hit her hard because it wasn’t picked up early enough. The earlier you pick it up the easier it is to control.

‘I grew up with the disease as well because she was ill – it is life-threatening. It’s scary.’

'It could be difficult when I was young because sometimes she couldn’t come on school trips and other times she was so embarrassed about her symptoms that I couldn't have my mates to stay over.

The single mother, from Essex, was diagnosed with severe Crohn’s Disease when she was in her early thirties.

She has had to undergo multiple operations to remove damaged parts of her bowel and she takes numerous medicines every day.

Rylan, 24, said: ‘She tries to keep on top of it and to follow a strict diet but it is always hard to know what foods will cause a flare up.’

Rylan, who won Celebrity Big Brother 2013, says that when he was a child his mother was not able to go on school trips with him

He added: ‘I have always been aware of my mum’s illness but it was when I came into my teens that I realised how serious it was.’

Crohn’s disease is a chronic condition, which affects about one in 1,200 people in the UK, causing inflammation of the lining of the digestive system, although it is most commons in the intestines

It causes symptoms including diarrhoea, intense abdominal pain, weight loss and fatigue.

The X Factor finalist says that his mother's life is dictated by the disease and that she has had to undergo multiple bowel operations to relieve the symptoms

The exact cause is not known but it is thought to be genetic and connected to the immune system. It is also known to be exacerbated by smoking.

There is currently no cure so medications have to be taken to reduce the symptoms and up to 70 per cent of patients require surgery to repair damaged parts of their digestive system.

Some even have to move onto a liquid-only diet if their symptoms are particularly severe.

Complications, such as a life-threatening bowel obstruction, can occur.

He is helping Crohn's and Colitis UK to raise awareness of the chronic condition - their campaign aims to educate every child and teacher in UK schools about the disease in an attempt to prevent embarrassment

Rylan is aware of the genetic element to Crohn’s disease.

He said: ‘I have been tested for it and it is a slight worry but it is my mum that I worry about.

‘I hope that if I get it I will be able to manage it well. I know a lot about it but for now I am happy and healthy.’

Crohn's affects one in every 1,200 people in the UK

The former model is now taking part in an awareness campaign organised by the charity Crohn’s and Colitis UK.

He said: ‘When I was growing up I thought my mum was the only person with Crohn’s.

‘This campaign is about raising awareness and we are trying to encourage every school in the country to educate the children and teachers about it – children with the condition shouldn’t have to be embarrassed and they shouldn’t have to explain in front of their class why they have to go to the toilet.’

He added: ‘I will do anything I can to help raise awareness. In the public eye it is not a glamorous disease but we want as many people as possible to know about it.

‘We want people not to be embarrassed, it is not a death sentence and it can be managed.’
