She sobbed her way through all 11 weeks of The Great British Bake off, only to fall at the final hurdle.

So when Ruby Tandoh’s ordeal was over at last, she certainly had plenty of sorrows to drown.

The disappointed contestant headed straight to her local pub to get ‘absolutely trolleyed’ – and kept her Twitter followers updated every step of the way.

Miss Tandoh made the final three of the BBC2 competition, but was eliminated when her ‘showstopper’ wedding cake failed to impress judges Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry.

Updates: The Bake Off star used Twitter to keep her fans in the loop as she drowned her sorrows

As soon as the final episode was aired, the 21-year-old former model hit the tiles with a female friend.

She was soon spotted the bar of at 
her local pub in Southend, Essex, where she had what she described as 
‘the most desperately needed/deserved/overdue pint of my life.’

Several hours later, the philosophy 
student had switched drinks. Tweeting a drunken message to Bake Off’s 
eventual winner Frances Quinn, she said: ‘I LOVE YOU! I’m sitting 
sobbing with pride and relief into my red wine. A friend for life :) 
xxx’

It seems Miss Tandoh may have been helped along the way by last year’s finalist James Morton.

He shared his version of the Bake Off ‘drinking game’ online, which requires viewers to down a shot of alcohol every time a contestant or judge uses one of the show’s well known innuendos such as ‘soggy bottom’ and ‘good bake’.

But Mr Morton updated the game – which became a hit with students last year – by insisting players finish all the alcohol in front of them when a contestant cries on air.

Given Miss Tandoh spectacularly failed to keep the floodgates closed when she lost Tuesday night’s final, watching herself back on TV may have led her to consume more than was wise.

She wrote: ‘Nothing like a drinking game to legitimise my getting absolutely trolleyed tonight. WOOHOO.’

The following morning – while a triumphant Miss Quinn was doing the rounds of breakfast TV studios – Miss Tandoh freely admitted she was nursing a sore head.

Asked how her hangover was, she wrote: ‘Feeling a more than a little queasy...’

Miss Tandoh has made no secret of the fact she found her progress through the different stages of Bake Off more difficult than most. 

Joy... and more usually pain: Ruby holds one of her delicious creations, and the tears flow after criticism from the judges in the final

Not such a showstopper: Ruby deliberately avoided decorative baking in case she was dismissed as 'silly', as evidenced by her lacklustre wedding cake

Writing an article for The Guardian yesterday, she complained at the ‘nastiness’ of some fans.

Viewers had persistently complained her self-effacing manner was false modesty, and accused her of flirting with Mr Hollywood to stay in the show.

She said: ‘I’d rather eat my own foot than attempt to seduce my way to victory, and even if I had any intention of playing that card, it’s insulting to both the judges to suggest that they’d ever let their professional integrity be undermined in that way.’
