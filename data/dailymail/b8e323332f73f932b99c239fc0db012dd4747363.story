Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson may have been showing symptoms of the deadly virus as early as last Friday - before she flew to Ohio for the weekend and then back to Texas. 

The CDC made the shocking announcement on Thursday, after Miss Vinson was revealed as the second medical worker in Dallas to contract Ebola from the U.S.'s 'patient zero' Thomas Duncan. 

On October 10, Miss Vinson, 29, may have had Ebola symptoms when she flew out of Dallas-Fort Worth Airport on Frontier Airlines Flight 1142 to Cleveland to plan her upcoming wedding, a health official said today.

CDC Dr Chris Braden said during a press briefing on Thursday: 'We had started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday.

'This has to do with the bridal shop. Some more information that has come through recently says we can't rule out that she might have had the start of her symptoms on Friday.' 

Seven people in Cleveland and Akron have put themselves in voluntary quarantine after coming into contact with Miss Vinson, including five friends whom she shopped with for bridesmaid dresses at bridal store, Coming Attractions, in Cleveland.

The news has prompted high schools and medical centers in Ohio to send home staff and students amid fears that they could have come into contact with the nurse.

Miss Vinson remained in her home for the three days she was in Cleveland, except for one trip to a bridal store with  friends - but authorities are pressing her further on her movements. 

The store's owners have voluntarily closed while CDC officials investigate the level of risk.

The owner of the store told Newsnet5 that Miss Vinson didn't seem sick  when she visited to pick out dresses. 

The 29-year-old is now being treated at Emory in Atlanta, Georgia where she was described as being in a stable condition.

A timeline of Ebola patient's Thomas Duncan and the two nurses, Nina Pham and Amber Vinson who contracted the virus while caring for him 

Miss Vinson was taken by chartered plane from Dallas to Atlanta Wednesday night, where she is currently being treated at Emory University Hospital

She was airlifted from Dallas, Texas on Wednesday evening on a specialized plane with quarantine unit, along with medical staff in hazmat suits.  

Miss Vinson was one of the nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital to treat Duncan when he was admitted a second time on September 28, in the first 'high-risk' days when there is a high volume of bodily fluids from projectile vomiting, bleeding and explosive diarrhea.   

According to CDC guidelines, the nurse should have limited her movements. 

It is not clear if Miss Vinson called the CDC before boarding her flight from Dallas to Cleveland.

The first nurse diagnosed was 26-year-old Nina Pham (right) who was in 'good condition' at Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Thursday

Damage control: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital is currently monitoring more than 75 health care workers who came into contact with Duncan during his stay. On Wednesday, the hospital announced it would be offering free rooms to these staff members, who may not want to risk infecting their family members

Before her return flight on Monday, the nurse noticed a spike in her temperature and called the CDC several times to see if she should get on the plane.

When she finally got through to a CDC representative, she was cleared since her 99.5F fever was beneath the 100.4 threshold.

CDC Director Dr Thomas Frieden admits that was the wrong call.

Dr Frieden also noted that Miss Vinson had flown to Ohio before the first nurse with Ebola, 26-year-old Nina Pham from Fort Worth, was diagnosed with the virus.

Miss Pham was described as being in a 'good condition' today.

She is being transferred to a special isolation ward at the National Institutes of Health Hospital in Maryland.

The Frontier Airlines plane that Amber Vinson flew from Cleveland to Dallas on Monday, flies out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on Wednesday. It emerged today that Miss Vinson may have been showing symptoms on her inbound flight to Cleveland
