An air traffic controller who allegedly joked to a pilot that he couldn't land is being investigated after the plane was forced to circle a busy airport for an hour and a half.

As Delta Flight 360 came in to land at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the controller reportedly joked that the plane couldn't land.

Moments later he said: 'I'm kidding, Delta 360. After you land I’ve got no one behind you. Expect to exit right. Delta 630 you’re clear to land on (runway) 27-Left.'

Joke gone wrong: The Delta plane was forced to ascend back to 40,000ft following the alleged joke from an air traffic controller (file picture)

However, according to local news organisation 11Alive Atlanta, the pilot had already changed course, ascending back to 40,000ft after aborting the landing.

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, which is investigating the incident, the plane had reached as low as 1,000ft before ascending back to 40,000ft.

The plane was then forced to circle the airport for an hour and a half while the situation on the ground was clarified and the plane could land safely.

After the air traffic controller told the pilot that he had been kidding, the captain responded: 'You sent us around. Delta 360 is on the go.'

An FAA spokesperson told 11Alive that there was never any danger for the pilot and passengers.

A spokesperson said: 'The FAA is investigating air traffic communications with Delta 630, a Boeing 777 aircraft on approach to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.'
