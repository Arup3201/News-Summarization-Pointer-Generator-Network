From matching tattoos of the Eiffel Tower and the Empire State Building to bizarre banana body art, couples are taking their love to new heights by getting matching etchings.

But as an entertaining post on American website Happyplace.com revealed, tattoos-for-two don't always go to plan.

Among the etchings that have caused regret since being added in the throes of early love or lust are green and red light sabres, a married pair with the words 'I do' and 'Ditto' inked onto their fingers and another couple who thought nothing said love quite like a pair of avocados sketched on their arms.

Locked up: She's got the key to his heart according to this unsightly pair of matching tattoos

Equally regrettable are the couple who got interlocked hearts etched onto their bodies. Apart, the inkings look like abstract lines, with the full glory of the tattoos only becoming apparent when their arms are locked together.

Other bizarre tattoos include the pair for whom death by alcohol equals romance. Their matching tattoos show a skull and crossbones, with the bones exchanged for gin bottles.

Although the tattooed twosomes boast some particularly awful examples, they're by no means alone in their mutual passion for ink.

Britney Spears and her former husband Kevin Federline got matching blue and pink dice tattoos, but both had them lasered off following their divorce.

Fellow Hollywood enfant terrible, Lindsey Lohan, also got a tattoo to celebrate her love for DJ Sam Ronson - who returned the favour - but once again, the laser was required after the pair broke up.

Even Rihanna has been caught out by the tattoo trend. Former love Chris Brown inked a portrait of her face on his neck, although may have to cover it up as the couple have now split.

One couple who haven't had to call in the laser specialists are happily married showbiz couple, Jay-Z and Beyonce, who showed their love by getting 'IV' inked onto their index fingers.
