The ranger who plunged more than 3,000 feet to his death yesterday while helping rescue four injured climbers down a crevasse has been pictured.

Mount Rainier ranger Nick Hall was helping to prepare the climbers to be taken off the 14,411-foot Cascade Range peak when he fell before shortly before 5pm, said Mount Rainier National Park spokesman Kevin Bacher.

Mr Bacher said Mr Hall, 34, didn't respond to attempts to contact him and was not moving, and he was dead when other rangers reached him at the 10,000-foot level several hours later.

Tragedy: Ranger Nick Hall, 34, was helping prepare the climbers to be taken from the 14,411-ft Washington state peak when he fell

Life: Mr Hall worked as an avalanche forecaster, ski patroller, climbing ranger and in the U.S. Marines Corps according to his Facebook page

Park officials notified relatives and other rangers before announcing Mr Hall's death late Thursday.

A
Chinook helicopter from Joint Base Lewis-McChord plucked three of the 
injured climbers off the mountain Thursday night while one member of the
party from Waco, Texas, remained overnight, waiting out a worsening 
storm in the company of park rangers.

Bacher
says all four had injuries that were not life-threatening. The two 
rescued from the mountain were taken to a hospital. None was immediately
identified.

Worsening visibility and 40 mph winds kept rescuers from removing the other two climbers late Thursday.

Storms on Mount Rainier are notoriously fierce and obstinate with severe winter-like storms said to not be uncommon during the summer months, according to the National Park Service.

'We were lucky to get two off the mountain' the spokesman said.

About
10,000 people attempt to summit the massive volcano each year, with 
most doing so in the summer. Only a few hundred climb the iconic 
mountain in the winter.

The Texas climbers were roped together when they fell on Emmons Glacier. The two women at the end of the rope ended up in a crevasse. Rangers who responded to a cell phone call helped them out of the crevasse.

Mr Hall, who was unmarried and without children, is originally from Patten, Maine, the park spokesman said.

He attended Western State College of 
Colorado and worked as a ski patroller at Stevens Pass, an avalanche 
forecaster at Yellowstone National Park and also served in the U.S. 
Marines Corps according to his Facebook page.

Tragic year: Mr Hall is the second ranger to die on the job this year at the park, with the first killed on New Year's Day after shot by a guest

The Seattle Times reports Hall had been with Mount Rainier National Park's climbing program for four years.

His death comes during what has already proven a difficult year for park staff. On New Year's Day, Mount Rainier Ranger Margaret Anderson was fatally shot as she tried to stop a man who drove through a tire chain checkpoint near Longmire

The 24-year-old man, Benjamin Colton Barnes, was suspected in a shooting early New Year's Day in Seattle, and his body was found the next day about a mile away in the snow.

Mr Hill is the third climbing ranger to die during service at the park and the seventh person this year,Â The Olympian reports.
