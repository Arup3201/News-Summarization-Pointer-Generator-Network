Floyd Mayweather might insist his skills haven't diminished with age but at 38, the world's best boxer does need a little help to keep niggling injuries at bay.

With his $300million mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao less than two weeks away, Mayweather is using a cryotherapy bath after training.

The bath is cooled to -175F (-115C) using liquid nitrogen and Mayweather spends up to three minutes in the chamber.

The boxer was the first person to use the bath in SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas.

'It tricks your body into thinking you're going into hypothermia,' owner David Levi told Sports Illustrated. 'So it sends blood from your arms and legs into your core. That blood picks up enzymes and oxygen and nutrients, and as you jump out, it circulates back through your body.'

Levi, who is also one of Mayweather's assistants, also revealed to TMZ that his boss calls him at three or four in the morning to use the machine, called a Cryosauna, which cost him $60,000 (£40,000).

Cryotherapy is a growing trend in sports with the Wales rugby team travelling to Poland for sessions in 2012 before building their own chamber in Cardiff.
