An extraordinary array of Hollywood props went on display today - including Marty McFly's hoverboard and Niki Lauda's Ferrari Formula 1 car from hit film Rush.

They form part of a staggering £1 million worth of memorabilia which will go under the hammer in the Vue Entertainment and Prop Store auction in London.

Also among the 300 items are a flame thrower used by Sigourney Weaver's character Ripley in 1979's Alien, which is likely to fetch £30,000.

Bidders will have to splash out up to £15,000 for Marty McFly's hoverboard from Back To The Future: Part II

Auction expects to reel-in between £3,500 to £4,500 for this Gremlin puppet when bids open on October 16

William Shatner's Captain James T Kirk costume from Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is expected to sell for £12,000.

And anyone wanting to pretend they're James Bond could splash out £10,000 on the full-size Q-Boat from 1999's The World is Not Enough.

Those wanting to get their hands on Marty McFly's hoverboard, which featured in 1989's Back to the Future: Part II, will have to splash out around £15,000.

Other props include a £10,000 Biker Scout helmet from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and a Gremlins puppet from Gremlins 2 - The New Batch.

The most valuable item being auctioned is an aluminium chair, designed as a concept for Dune, created by the late H.R Giger and expected to fetch up to £80,000.

Fans will be able to view 200 of the most valuable and iconic pieces during a free two-week exhibition starting today, before the auction at Vue Westfield, London.

Tim Richards, CEO of Vue Entertainment International said: 'We're delighted to be hosting this amazing collection of film memorabilia - one of the biggest of its kind - at Vue Westfield.

'From serious collectors and keen investors to film fanatics and movie buffs, we are expecting a high level of interest from people eager to grab a slice of film history.

'It's the first time an auction on this scale has been held in a cinema, so it should make for an entertaining evening.

'The exhibition will ensure everyone who wants to get an intimate look at some of these amazing and iconic props can do so absolutely free.'

Also among the items are a Batmobile model used in Batman Forever, which is expected to fetch £25,000.

Captain Nemo's 25ft-long Nautilus Car from the 2003 blockbuster The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is likely to sell for £60,000.

One of the least expensive items up for grabs is a film crew jacket from the set of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, likely to go for a more affordable £80.

Stephen Lane, Prop Store Founder, said: 'After 16 years selling movie props and costumes to collectors around the world, we're incredibly proud to announce our first ever live auction.
