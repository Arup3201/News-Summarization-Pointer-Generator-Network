As Arsenal consider splashing out £20million on Sami Khedira, Lukas Podolski certainly seems keen on his Germany team-mate joining him in the Premier League.

Podolski has enjoyed the limelight after his nation won the World Cup on Sunday night, posting several pictures on social media, despite not featuring at all in the later rounds.

And on this occasion - during a Khedira interview back in buoyant Berlin - the Gunners forward screamed: 'Arsenal!' Perhaps suggesting a move is close.

Mesut Ozil, one of Khedira's closest friends, is believed to have already spoken to the 27-year-old about the London life.

Arsenal have already signed Alexis Sanchez for £30m, while an £11m deal fo Mathieu Debuchy should be completed this week.

One sticking point for Real Madrid's Khedira is his £150,000-a-week wage demands. Sportsmail understands some members of the Arsenal hierarchy are concerned about the potential cost of the deal.

As Per Mertesacker, Ozil and Podolski enjoy the week of their life, their club side have been working hard on strengthening the squad for a title tilt.

And it's obvious who the latter wants them to sign...
