These creepy crawlers are anything but scary... in fact, in this video, they're downright mesmerising.

The large insects were recorded by YouTube user Rokky20 as they performed what looks like a choreographed dance across his backyard wall.

'They look very cute,' he wrote under the video. 'Aren't they?' 

In a new video from YouTube user Rokky 20, bark lice prove themselves as much more than creepy crawlers

The YouTuber filmed the lice performing what looks like choreographed movement on his backyard wall

What makes this video particularly unique is the sheer size of the insect - they rarely exceed six millimetres.

The flightless, wingless species, known as psocoptera, are most commonly found in old books or wastepaper.

Though native to Madeira and the Canary Islands, as of 2007, the species had colonised to the mild Cornish coast. 

What makes this synchronised movement particular unique is the sheer size of these insects

Not so sure about that! 'They look very cute,' Rokky20 wrote in the video caption. 'Aren't they?'
