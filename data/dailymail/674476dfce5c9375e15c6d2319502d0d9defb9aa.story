Like most men who have turned 40 – and many who are much younger – I endlessly and pointlessly worry about my health. A hangover can easily become terminal hepatitis C after a few misguided clicks on Net Doctor.

Recently my partner Diana – fed up with my constant worrying –  told me she was getting one of those all-singing, all-dancing private health MOTs via her work’s healthcare plan, and ordered me to do the same.

I was intrigued, as any middle-aged hypochondriac would be. Had my misspent youth left irreparable damage?

But with no health insurance of my own, the day of tests would cost me a hefty £650. Surely, there are other options?

After
a little research I discovered I could get almost everything offered by
the private MOT companies for free or next to nothing with an NHS 
Health Check at the GP and a fitness test at my gym.

Dr Jonty Heaversedge, a GP in South London, says: ‘We offer a series of basic tests to assess the risks of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and kidney disease.’

The service, he explains, is available to adults aged between 40 and 74. There are not as many tests as in the more complex private screening; an ECG for example.

Dr Heaversedge adds: ‘The NHS  is more discerning. If there is a need for further testing – whether through family history or lifestyle – then it can be done.’

And so I submitted myself. The good news: I’d save a lot of money. The bad news: I might find out I’m really dying.

CHOLESTEROL TEST

I have a pin-prick blood test where a tiny sample taken from a finger is put on a cartridge, then inserted  into a machine. In a few seconds a number pops up on the digital display. ‘High cholesterol can contribute to blocked arteries,’ says Dr Heaversedge. These are associated with heart attack and stroke. The NHS recommends total cholesterol should be scored lower than five.

Result: Action required

My cholesterol test gives me a slightly raised level of 5.53. I’m confused as Diana is vegetarian and  I’m hardly overweight at 6ft 3in with a size 34 waist. But we eat far too much cheese and lashings of butter. It’s no disaster – I’ve no family history of heart problems. I’m advised to cut down on dairy and sugar and come back in a month.

KIDNEY HEALTH

Next, a urine test: I’m given a little screw-top jar, pop to the loo, return, and the nurse dips in a stick which changes colour as the chemicals react with protein in the sample. ‘High protein in the urine can be associated with kidney disease,’ says Dr Heaversedge. This problem is increasingly prevalent, due to high blood sugar and blood pressure. Early treatment is essential.

Result: No action required

I hand over a sample which looks suspiciously cloudy – only to find the testing strip turns yellow, I’m ‘completely normal’. Blue would have been bad news.

BLOOD PRESSURE

The test for blood pressure is familiar – an inflatable cuff is strapped round my upper arm and inflated until it’s tight, then air is slowly let out. High blood pressure increases the risk of serious vascular health problems such as heart attack, stroke and kidney disease. It often has no symptoms.

Result: No action required

There are two numbers: systolic, the highest level your blood pressure reaches when your heart beats; and diastolic, the lowest level your blood pressure reaches as your heart relaxes between beats. It should be between 90/60 and 140/90 and at 107/60, I am ‘excellent’. This feels like a walk in the park.

Result: Martin's GP check-up came back mostly positive, putting an end to months of concern about his health

BODY MASS INDEX (BMI)

Your BMI is an indicator of how healthy your weight is. A higher reading will indicate obesity, which raises risks of everything from diabetes to cancers. It is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared.

Result: Action may be required

At 91kg and with a BMI of 25.2, I’m just overweight. This comes as a shock as I rarely eat breakfast, busily attending to the needs of my three-year-old, Sonny. ‘Breakfast is one of the most important meals  of the day,’ says my GP. ‘Without it, your body goes into lockdown and actually stores energy as fat.’

WAIST MEASUREMENT

‘This indicates diabetes risk more than BMI alone,’ says Dr Heaversedge. ‘Measure around your belly button, not where your trousers  sit, and don’t suck in.’ Men should measure less than 37in and women 31.5in.

Result: No action required

At 34in, I’m bang in the middle of the safe area. Since the test, I’ve lost 2kg, putting my BMI back in the healthy bracket, through cutting down on dairy products, eating breakfast, light cycling, gym trips and generally thinking about what I eat.

Overall improvement: Martin urges other men over 40 to get a health MOT from their doctor, insisting it has improved his sex life and made him happier

OVERALL CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK SCORE

‘We don’t take just one risk factor for cardiovascular disease,’ says Dr Heaversedge. ‘We combine different elements, such as age, sex, blood pressure, smoking and cholesterol.

Result: Good – but action required

I have less than a ten per cent chance of developing heart disease over the next ten years. But I smoke – a couple a day. ‘Your result is good but would be even better if you gave up smoking,’ says Dr Heaversedge.

CONCLUSION

Like many men, I’ve been sitting around worrying about my health but not doing anything about it for too long.

I’m sleeping better, feel happier and my sex life has improved. There are other things I could have had, such as diabetes screening and a liver function test, but I am assured that due to my history and lack of health problems, it was unnecessary.

Older men can have prostate cancer screening, and after 60 we all get a bowel cancer screening test. For free! And we all love a bargain, so why not do it?

‘For the most part our bodies are incredibly resilient,’ says Dr Heaversedge. ‘By checking our health, we generally don’t discover we’re going to die imminently, but we can make changes for the better to improve our health and the chance of living a better life for longer.’

For my part, I would urge other men to get checked out. If I can do it, anybody can.
