After thousands poured on to Britain's beaches last week to take advantage of the warm weather, today suncream and bikinis were replaced by scarves and gloves as temperatures plummeted across the country.

As many might have predicted the arrival of the weekend triggered a dramatic change in the weather with snow even being seen in the Shetland Isles in the early part of the day.

It was also a very different picture in the small Scottish village of Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire which recorded the highest March temperature ever in Scotland on Wednesday when it peaked at 22.9C.

Today the mercury had fallen to a much chillier 8C in Aboyne and it is a similar story across the rest of the country today with daytime temperatures in most places of between 8C and 10C.

Wintry scene: The Shetland Isles today experienced sleet in scenes reminiscent of this one when snow carpeted the islands in 2010.

Remember this? Snow may return to some areas next week, bringing back memories of February, when snow fell across the country, including in St James's Park in London (pictured)

More than 100 tons of tomatoes are being picked a month early this weekend - due to the recent spell of unusually warm weather.

The unexpected crop will be supplied to supermarkets including Marks & Spencer, Sainsbury's and Waitrose from Britain's biggest grower, based on the Isle of Wight.

Brian Moralee, growing manager of Wight Salads Group, said: 'We were thrilled with this early bust of warm, sunny weather.

'Here on the island we feel good weather more, which brings out the best in our tomatoes' taste and quality.'

The Isle of Wight was first used for tomato production by the Romans because of its favourable climate.

But the fruit is not usually picked until the end of April.

Nowhere got close to the extraordinarily sunny heights of the previous five days with Pembrey Sands in Swansea recording the highest UK temperature of 13.3C.

The coldest place in the UK was the top of the 1,245m Cairngorm mountain in Scotland where it was a chilly -7C.

Lake Vyrnwy recorded the coldest temperature in Wales at 7.5C and the mittens and bobble hats were definitely out in Kirkwall in Scotland's Orkney Islands where it was a shivery 5.6C.

People were also wrapping up warm in Loftus in Yorkshire where blustery 15 knot breezes gave a windchill temperature of 6.2C - the lowest recorded temperature in England today.

At the other end of the scale in 
England the warmest place today was Solent at 13.1C while Glasgow 
recorded the hottest weather in Scotland at 12.5C - Murlough was the 
mildest spot in Northern Ireland with a high of 12.4C.

MET
office spokesman Helen Waite said the conditions were a stark contrast 
to the clear skies and sunshine of the previous few days and she 
forecast the weather to continue deteriorating through the next week 
with snowfalls likely by Wednesday, when temperatures are anticipated to
fall further.

She 
said: 'Looking ahead we are expecting it to get colder still on Monday. 
Across the country there is a weather system coming down from the north 
and it will be rainy on Monday night. With cold weather coming in there 
is a risk of snow on Tuesday or Wednesday.'

While some rain is predicted over the
course of the next week, forecasters say they do not anticipate seeing 
the double the average rainfall required to end the current drought.

What a difference a day makes: Students Louise Green, Hannah Green, Anna
Roberts and Chloe Jennings enjoyed taking a break from studying to 
enjoy the unusually hot weather last week, but today it was a case of wrapping up warm

Forecasters Netweather suggest that temperatures in the Scottish Highlands will dip to as low as -11C by Wednesday with widespread freezing temperatures across much of the UK

The
18 month dry spell has been declared the worst since 1921 and forced 
water companies to bring in a hosepipe ban across the South and East of 
England next week.

Yet days before the ban comes into effect millions of householders have been 
left confused about which rules apply following a series of U-turns 
from companies about exemptions for pensioners, businesses and 
gardeners.

The ban on 
hosepipes and sprinklers will be the 
most widespread since 2005.

Easy pickings: A lack of rain and the recent mild conditions has meant 100 tonnes of tomatoes on the Isle of Wight have ripened a month early

A large area of Yorkshire is now also in a state of drought with groundwater 
levels across England and Wales have dropped to the lowest level on the 
Government's scale.

It was 1921 when the UK last went through a drought as bad as the current crisis.

Recent
warm weather has caused tomatoes at a farm on the Isle of Wight to 
ripen a month early with pickers harvesting the first crop of British 
tomatoes today.

The unseasonably hot spell has ripened 100 tonnes of tomatoes which are not ordinarily picked until the end of April.

Thousands of the tomatoes, which include the piccolo from the Wight Salads farm in the Arreton Valley, the UK's biggest tomato grower are now ready to be eaten.
