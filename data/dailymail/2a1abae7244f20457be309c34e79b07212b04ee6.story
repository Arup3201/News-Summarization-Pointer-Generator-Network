Amazon is refreshing its line-up of tablet computers with two new devices, both called Kindle Fire HDX while taking a serious swipe at its competitors who continue to dominate the market.

One of its new tablets has a 7-inch screen, while the other is 8.9-inch version and both are said to be three times faster than the previous generation, as well as lighter and thinner.

Both also have have sharper, more colourful displays that feature more pixels per inch than the latest iPad, or Google's new Nexus 7.

Amazon's 7-inch and a 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HDX tablets, pictured right to left, are three times faster than older models. They have higher pixel-per-inch displays than Apple's current iPad - making text or images sharper. New features include a Mayday tool that lets first-time tablet owners get customer service support

To access the new Mayday feature, users can press the Help button from the Kindle Fire HDX's homescreen. It will then call a live free technical support team member to help with operational questions or access to books, movies, songs or other media

The 7-inch model has a screen resolution of 1980 x 1200, giving a PPI of 330, while the 8.9-inch, 2560 x 1600 display has a 339 PPI.

By comparison, the current iPad with Retina Display runs PPI of 264, while the new Google Nexus 7, quoted as having the best tablet screen on the market, has 323 PPI. 

The 7-inch model is now 8mm thick and weighs 303g - down 
from 10mm and 394g. Whereas the 8.9-inch model is 8mm thick, down from 9mm, and weighs 374g.

Both Kindle HDX models also come with 
Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, which is top of the line 
for tablets, and can handle graphics four times 
faster than before.

In the U.S, the 7-inch Kindle Fire HDX starts at $229 with 8GB memory, while the 8.9inch costs $379 also for 8GB.

Additionally, to help people who have not owned tablets before the new Kindles come with a feature called 'Mayday', which lets users speak to a live customer service representative in a video window when downloading apps or using certain features.

The helpers can explain new features or troubleshoot problems while guiding users with on-screen hand scribbles. They can even take control of the device remotely.

CEO Jeff Bezos introduced the feature, saying it is 'completely unique' and takes advantage of Amazon's massive cloud computing and customer service infrastructure. It also builds on Amazon's reputation for excellent customer service.

This image shows the new 8.9-inch Amazon Kindle HDX tablet, centre, the 7-inch Kindle HDX, left, and an updated Kindle HD, right. The HDX models are four times faster at handling graphics. The new Kindle HD has a magnesium alloy case but has the same processor as older Kindle Fire models

'You shouldn't have to be afraid of your device,' Bezos said.

In a demo, Bezos asked an on-screen customer service representative to recommend an app. The rep suggested Angry Birds: Star Wars II, while also giving instructions on how to set time limits on various activities for children.

While the new Kindles are upgraded in several ways, Amazon also cut the price on what will be its entry-level, updated 7-inch tablet, the Kindle Fire HD with 8GB of memory now costing $139 in the U.S.

The new Kindle Fire HD has a magnesium alloy body, like the HDX models, but has the same screen resolution and processing power of the older models.

Stephen Baker, a consumer technology analyst with research firm NPD Group, said the price cut to the Kindle Fire HD will do more to help Amazon compete in the tablet market than the added features on the newer models.

In the U.S, the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HDX, pictured, starts at $379 for 8GB memory. The 7-inch model starts at $229, also for 8GB. Prices and release dates for the UK have not yet been announced

'That's where that model needs to be priced,' Baker said, explaining that there are numerous manufacturers with tablets with screens that measure seven inches diagonally, all priced around the same mark.

'A big focus in that 7-inch category is just price.'

Between May and July, Kindles accounted for 17 per cent of all tablets sold in the U.S. compared to 48 per cent for Apple's iPad and 8 per cent for Samsung's Galaxy line, according to NPD.

Globally, Amazon's shipments between April and June were down 59 per cent from a year earlier, at 470,000.

This is compared to 14.6 million for Apple's iPad, down 17 percent from a year ago, and 10.8 million for Samsung's Galaxy line, up 539 per cent. Amazon sells most of its Kindles around the Christmas holidays, Baker said.

Beyond the improved specifications, Amazon also unveiled more features that incorporate data from its IMDb movie database partner.

With the newer tablets, users who turn on the 'X-ray' feature can see a small window that lists the name of a song that is playing in some TV shows and movies.

One tap brings up the option to buy the song. Users can also look for all music in a show and zip to the exact spot where a particular song is playing.

People who have set up Amazon's video player as an app on their TVs or through game consoles can also follow along in real-time on their tablets, getting information on actors and trivia related to the shows on their larger screen.

Music lovers can see song lyrics when they play songs bought from Amazon, lyrics are highlighted as they are sung and tapping on the lyrics will zip to the appropriate point in the song.

Bezos said these services are only possible because Amazon provides the hardware, operating system, applications, cloud infrastructure and services for the devices.

The 'hardest and coolest' services such as its Mayday service lie at the intersection of 'customer delight' and 'deep integration through the entire stack,' he added.

Amazon also unveiled new 'origami covers' that lie flat when closed over the screen but can be folded and snapped into place as a stand that works both in horizontal and vertical position. They'll come in seven different colours in the U.S for between $45 and $70.
