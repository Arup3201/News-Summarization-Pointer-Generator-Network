Liverpool are exploring the possibility of sending Suso to Sevilla as part of a £16million deal to sign exciting left back Alberto Moreno.

Moreno is training with Spain in Madrid, having just arrived home from Sevilla’s post-season tour of Indonesia and could play in his country's friendly against Bolivia.

The 21-year-old has been closely watched by Manchester United, Chelsea and Manchester City this season but after a bright start had some indifferent performances in the second half of the season. Nevertheless, there is no doubting his ability and his age allows room for improvement.

On loan: Suso spent last season at Almeria

Liverpool have taken the initiative with an opening offer and are willing to use 20-year-old unsettled midfielder Suso as a sweetener.

The Spain U21 star had a successful loan spell at Almeria last season and Sevilla are keen to help him put his career back on track.

Liverpool continue to negotiate with Bayer Leverkusen over midfielder Emre Can although his wage demands have taken them by surprise. Leverkusen are one of the few clubs in the Bundesliga that compete with Premier League wages.

Rodgers has been looking at signing a top class left back for more than 12 months and tried to bring Guilherme Siquiera to Anfield last August before he eventually brought Aly Cissokho in on a season long-loan.

Academy graduate Jon Flanagan ended up filling the role with distinction but he is naturally right-footed and will be moved across in time. Liverpool have also been considering Chelsea's Ryan Bertrand as an option.

Manager Brendan Rodgers is also ready to signal a move for Swansea's Michel Vorm now that Lukasz Fabianski has joined Swansea from Arsenal.

Xherdan Shaqiri remains an option should Liverpool fail to sign Adam Lallana. The 22-year-old Swiss international indicated he was ready to leave Bayern telling 20 Minuten: 'It's clear that I cannot continue like this. If nothing changes, I will have to make some changes myself. I want to play in the important games as well and not just in the Bundesliga. I don't want to go through another year like this.

'I only want to play for a major club. The Champions League is important to me. We will see what happens. England would be an option. If I were to leave Bayern, it will be for a foreign club. But it will have to be a club challenging for the title.'

Liverpool have made a fresh enquiry about free agent Seydou Keita, 34, but he is also considering a new offer from Valencia. Liverpool spoke to Keita in January but he was apparently upset when it became clear they wanted him as a squad player.
