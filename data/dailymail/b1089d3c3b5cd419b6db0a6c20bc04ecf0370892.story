The wife of imprisoned Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein is to plead guilty to conspiring to hide more than $1 
million in jewelry from federal authorities.

Kim Rothstein, 38, along with her attorney Scott Saidel and friend Stacie Weisman, are all facing money laundering charges for attempting to conceal the jewels and plotting to sell them on.

Her husband Scott Rothstein, once a high-flying attorney in Fort Lauderdale, is serving a 50-year prison sentence for fraud for his role in a $1.4billion Ponzi scheme.

The largest investment fraud in South Florida history involved investments in fake legal settlements where the returns came from the money that had been put in rather than from profit made from the scheme.

Rothstein, wearing a striped, collared 
blouse, spoke only once during Wednesday's court proceedings, 
acknowledging that she was understood the change of plea hearing, reported the Sun Sentinel.

Kim Rothstein's attorney acknowledged after the hearing that she will plead guilty on February 1 to the lone charge she faces which is a count of criminal conspiracy - the charge can carry a punishment of up to five years in prison.

'She has accepted responsibility for what she has done and is looking forward to moving on with her life and putting this insanity behind her," said David Tucker.

Federal authorities seized the couple's palatial homes, fleet of luxury cars, cash, jewellery and watches in November 2009.

Two years later the Rothsteins had to
give up much of what was left of the couple's belongings to bankruptcy 
lawyers attempting to recoup money for her husband's victims.

Prosecutors
claim Kim Rothstein assured them they had everything but in fact she 
and Saidel, 45, and Weisman, 49, 'knowingly took action to conceal 
certain items of jewellery' and then attempted to sell a portion of 
them.

They are accused 
of planning to sell the 12-carat diamond ring to Daoud and have Marin 
sell off other pieces, according to prosecutors.

Later, prosecutors said, Kim Rothstein 
and her co-conspirators took steps to persuade Scott Rothstein to testify
falsely about the jewellery's whereabouts.

One key piece was a 12-carat diamond ring that had become central to bankruptcy proceedings in the collapse of the Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler law firm.

A local jewellery store that had sold the ring to Scott Rothstein was trying to find it, leading to a web of lies and deception that even included a false claim that the ring had been sold to a dead man, prosecutors said.

The other pieces include five rings, including the 12-carat ring, an engagement ring and a wedding band containing 18 emerald cut diamonds.

There are also 10 watches, among them a Rolex Daytona Cosmograph with leopard print design, a women's gold and diamond Piaget and a platinum and diamond Pierre Kunz. 

For sale: A frank Muller white gold, diamond and rainbow coloured Roman numeral marker wtach was part of the collection of jewellery sold off that belonged to Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein

Quite a collection: A Zenith yellow gold watch and a Audemars Piquet titanium watch engraved 'Especially made for Arnold Schwarzenegger'

Historical: Scott Rothstein owned cuff links that once belonged to the 37th U.S. president Richard Nixon

The list also include five sets of earrings, four necklaces, two bracelets and a variety of gold coins, including 26 South African Krugerrands.

Finally, there were a pair of pearl, diamond and sapphire cufflinks, more than $33,000 in cash, several silver pens and 50 1-ounce gold bars.

Miami U.S. Attorney Wifredo Ferrer said: 'When a witness lies under oath or conspires to obstruct justice, the integrity of our system of justice is undermined.'

Lawyers for Kim Rothstein said in a statement she takes 'full responsibility' for her actions but insisted she did not know about her husband's $1.2 billion scam.

The statement continued: 'Kim welcomes the opportunity to put a very challenging time in her life behind her.

'Kim is a vibrant, diverse and deeply caring person who looks forward to being a productive citizen in the years to come.'

She faces up to five years in federal prison for charges of money laundering, obstruction of justice and witness tampering conspiracy.

Lavish: A cushioned mixed cut 6.75 natural ruby ring owned by the Rothsteins was also sold off

Complicated: A white gold Pierre Kunz watch with round black, 3 sub-dials, and moon phase function

Bling: A yellow gold DeBeers pendent set with diamonds and gems

Driving in the fast lane: A 2009 Mercedes-Benz SL 550 Roadster with just 4,834 miles on the clock
