After an Austrian drag queen won the Eurovision song contest, Russia has demanded a ‘straight’ version of the annual competition, which it has denounced as ‘endless madness’.

Popularly known as 'the bearded lady', Conchita won the Eurovision Song Contest on Saturday night in Copenhagen with the James Bond-like theme Rise Like A Phoenix, before a global TV audience estimated to be around 180million people in 45 countries.

But some watching in Russia bristled at the sight of Conchita, the alter ego of 25-year-old Thomas Neuwirth.

Outspoken: Communist Party deputy Valery Rashkin has called for Russia to leave the Eurovision Song Contest

‘The last Eurovision contest's results exhausted our patience,’ Communist Party deputy Valery Rashkin told the Interfax news agency, according to The Local.

‘We must leave this competition. We cannot tolerate this endless madness.’

Mr Rashkin proposed that Russia breaks away from Eurovision and helps create a Voice Of Eurasia contest, with nations from the former Soviet Union.

Russia has an intolerant stance on homosexuality. It does not recognise gay marriages or civil unions, and openly gay and lesbian Russians say they've been targeted by vigilantes, even more so since President Vladimir Putin approved a law last year banning what it calls gay 'propaganda' from reaching minors.

Mr Rashkin's Eurovision proposal was met with a chorus of approval by advisers to reactionary Belarus President Aleksander Lukashenko.

‘Conchita Wurst's Eurovision victory symbolizes the complete collapse of the European Union's moral values,’ the country's advisory Slavic Committee said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Conchita Wurst has had a sausage named in her honour, created by the butcher near her family home in Bad Mitterndorf in Styria in southern Austria.

Joe Aichinger, 38, created the Conchita Wurst - Wurst means sausage in German - as a tribute to the village's most famous inhabitant and was delighted when she made a surprise visit to the shop and even helped him sell them after a visit to see her parents, who run a nearby guesthouse.

He said that the sausage creation was selling well and added: ‘It's extra spicy, just like she is.’

And he was delighted when Conchita turned up and donned a white coat to help him sell the sausage to locals.

Asked what she thought about the creation she said: ‘It looks good, but I never imagined it would be so big.’

She said: ‘Wurst is, after all, my name, it's from the German expression. It's all sausage, which means I don't care. It's all sausage after all if I am man, or a woman.’

Village priest Michael Unger was an unexpected fan. He said: ‘I am proud that she stands to what she is.’

He even gave her a pack of sausages to take with her. And the first person that was given a sample was the Danish ambassador to Austria, Liselotte Plesner, who had given her tips on the language before her trip to Copenhagen.
