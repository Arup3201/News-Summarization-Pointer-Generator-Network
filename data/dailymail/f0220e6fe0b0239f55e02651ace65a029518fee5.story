Rickie Lambert deserves to keep his place for Liverpool's crunch Premier League clash against Stoke City on Saturday, according to Gary Neville.

The former Southampton frontman has scored two goals in as many starts for the Reds and broke his champions League duck in Wednesday night's 2-2 draw against Ludogorets.

Mario Balotelli has failed to find the net in the league since his switch to Anfield and missed the stalemate in Sofia due to a groin strain.

However,  Neville believes the Italian should be playing second fiddle to Lambert.

'He should be playing 100 per cent ahead of Balotelli,' he told Sky Sports.

'The Liverpool players will want Rickie Lambert. He's someone to play off and make movements. He deserves to keep his place. He brought people into play and showed a good touch.'

Reds hero Jamie Carragher reckons the 32-year-old should have had more opportunities after being restricted to just two Premier League starts since his summer switch to Merseyside. 

'He needs to be playing regularly,' said Carragher. 'Maybe not against the elite, but in your run-of-the-mill games he should have had more opportunities. He's a goalscorer and can hold the ball up.'

Liverpool legend Graeme Souness echoed the thoughts of his fellow pundits and says Lambert could provide the answer to their goalscoring problems.

'He's a clever player and knows the position inside out,' said Souness. 'He's a throwback if you like, a traditional centre forward. He will take the centre half on and has an eye for goal.'
