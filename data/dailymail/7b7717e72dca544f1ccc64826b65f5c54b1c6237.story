Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey has made another political gaffe, claiming a child born today is going to live to 150 to justify his cuts to Medicare.

Mr Hockey was speaking on Fairfax Radio on Monday morning and was trying to convince Australians that they should pay for their health care.

'It's kind of remarkable that somewhere in the world today, it's highly probable that a child is being born that is going to live to 150,' Mr Hockey was reported as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald.

The treasurer also refused to address reports he and Prime Minister Tony Abbott argued over a scuttled $20 Medicare rebate cut, labelling the rumours as 'gossip'

He continued: 'How do we ensure that we have good quality of life the whole way through? This is the conversation we are going to be having with the Australian people over the next few months.'

The treasurer also refused to address reports he and Prime Minister Tony Abbott argued over a scuttled $20 Medicare rebate cut, labelling the rumours as 'gossip'.

This comes after it was reported by News Corp Mr Abbott pushed on with the $20 cut despite heated opposition from Mr Hockey, and former health minister Peter Dutton, before it was ultimately scrapped amid a public and doctor backlash.

When asked if the report was wrong, Mr Hockey refused to comment.

'I'm not going to engage in discussion on gossip,' Mr Hockey said.

'Sometimes it's better to reverse a position than continue with a decision that's going to have bad ramifications.'

Mr Hockey said 2015 would be about 'jobs and families', and said lower petrol prices had put money back in family pockets.

He also said changes to the GST were unlikely without agreement from Labor and state governments.

'In relation to the GST it is our very strong view you've got to have unanimous agreement,' Mr Hockey said. 

Before this gaffe, Mr Hockey also caused embarrassment to the Prime Minister after declaring Mr Abbott had sought advice from News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch on paid parental leave before consulting his colleagues

This latest incident comes after the treasurer said poor people did not drive cars.

He made the comments while the government was looking to reintroduce twice-yearly indexation of the fuel excise, a budget measure opposed by both Labor and the Greens who said it would hit low-income families the hardest.

'The poorest people either don't have cars or actually don't drive very far in many cases,' he told ABC Radio.

Before this gaffe, Mr Hockey also caused embarrassment to the Prime Minister after declaring Mr Abbott had sought advice from News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch on paid parental leave before consulting his colleagues.

The treasurer revealed details of the private meeting in his book, Hockey: Not Your Average Joe.

It is claimed by Mr Hockey that Mr Abbott only mentioned the paid parental scheme to him as 'a brief add-on in a telephone conversation, with no specific date or details attached', before it was announced.

'They were encouraged to support it [Murdoch's editors], notwithstanding that it represented a tax impost and was skewed to be of most benefit to parents outside their middle-Australian readership,' Mr Hockey said in the book.
