Unable to travel: Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings broke his leg in a Utah ski accident in December rendering him unable to attend this year's CES Las Vegas global technology event

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was in a ski accident over the holidays that was bad enough to put the newly minted billionaire in the hospital and prevent him from traveling.

Hastings, who co-founded the streaming entertainment leader in 1997, was vacationing in Utah last month when the accident occurred.

The broken leg the executive suffered prevented him from attending 2015's CES Las Vegas global technology event. He prominently represented the company at the previous year's event.

At the 2014 CES, Hastings helped support the launch of an LG smart TV.

On January 5, Netflix Chief Streaming and Partnerships Officer Greg Peters appeared on stage to tout the company where schedules had previously indicated Hastings would be.

Early this month, Netflix spokesperson Marlee Moseley told Svenska Dagbladet: 'He is doing well and is recovering nicely, but he can not travel at the moment.'

Reached for comment by the Daily Mail on Monday, Moseley revealed Hastings had broken his leg. 

Moseley said Hastings planned to do the company's earnings call via video on Tuesday.

Now 54, the Massachusetts native earned a bachelors degree from Bowdoin College in 1983 followed by an MSCS in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University in 1988, according to his corporate bio page.

Between his degrees, Hastings served in Swaziland with the Peace Corps.

He founded Pure Software in 1991. After that successful venture was acquired by Rational Software in 1997, Hastings would go on to co-found Netflix.

Despite some leadership stumbles--most notably when the company made the leap to become predominantly a streaming service in 2011--Hastings has helped lead his company to the head of digital streaming pack.

Hastings became a billionaire in 2014.
