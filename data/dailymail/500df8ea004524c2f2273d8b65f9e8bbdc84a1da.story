They are exclusive areas where the average house will cost you more than £1million.

But this year the Golden Postcode Club has expanded with four extra districts added to its select list.

East Sheen in south-west London and Chiswick in west London both managed to nudge their way in with hundreds of properties breaking the £1million barrier.

Four extra districts have been added to the Golden Postcode Club this year. One of them is Cobham, in Surrey, where Hatchford Hall (above) is

They join Guildford and Cobham, in Surrey, which were both added to the select band for the first time this year.

The club makes up just 0.8 per cent of the UK's 2,760 postcodes. 

The highest average house price was in W8 in Kensington, London, where buyers were set back around £2.65m, The Sunday Times reported.  

The data was collected by property website Zoopla, which compared average house prices in districts across the UK.

Nearly all of the postcodes are in London. Kensington Palace Gardens (above) has typically been the most expensive street in Britain with an average house price of £36million in 2013

It also showed that the number of areas where houses were worth more than £500,000 increased by nearly 25 per cent.

While most of the postcodes were in or near London some - including Solihull in Birmingham, Bryher in the Isles of Scilly and Watlington in Oxfordshire - were hundreds of miles away.

Twelve extra postcodes were also added to the list where the houses cost more than £750,000 on average.

UK house prices rose by an average of £16,000 - or 8.5 per cent - in 2014, according to Halifax.

Chiswick in west London is also one of the newcomers to the club. It is where the Thames Zachary House (above) went on sale for just over £6.25million in 2012 

Most of the golden postcodes include houses that have vast extra rooms, including this conservatory at the Thames Zachary House

A total of 18,000 properties in Britain changed hands for more than £1m last year.

Edinburgh was the only region in Scotland where any properties above that threshold were sold.

Prices in some areas of London surged by almost 25 per cent, Halifax suggested.

Hampstead (pictured), along with Highgate, is the top traditional comfort zone in London - with an average price of £1.04m

The news comes as the Government admitted Britons have been ‘frozen out of the housing market’.

In a statement to parliament Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, said too many people had been unable to get on the housing ladder.

He said: 'Too many have found themselves frozen out of the housing market and denied the opportunities their parents had to get started in their own homes.'
