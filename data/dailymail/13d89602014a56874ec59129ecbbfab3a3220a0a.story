This villager is just in time for Halloween with these astonishing crafts of a plant from the pumpkin family, but modelling one on a swan isn't exactly the most obvious way to scare the neighbours.

A proud Liu Xianzhen was pictured yesterday by photographer Zhu Xudong showing off these amazing gourds that he grew in the Jiujianfang village of Langfang in Hebei province, China.

The village, which is located to the 
south of Beijing, has been growing and making the crafted gourd 
products, attracting collectors from the nearby capital and other big 
cities in recent years.

Gourds
and pumpkins are from the Cucurbita family, which also includes squash.
Gourds, which have hard skins, are mostly only grown as a decorative 
crop by gardeners in Britain.
