New doubts arose over the handling of the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the US after his family claims the hospital that cared for him has withheld records of experimental drug testing for weeks.

Thomas Eric Duncan's sister Mai Wureh has claimed that out of thousands of pages of medical files released by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, information about the drug brincidofovir were not given.

Wureh, herself a registered nurse, had been concerned about Duncan receiving the drug since he was first administered a dose.

She says she attempted to phone the medical records division repeatedly after his death in order to obtain more information about its effects and the treatment regimen.

In the collection of records, which totals 1,450 pages, was a code supposed to allow access to electronic records for the family, but Wureh alleges it does not work.

'I called for a new code and was told that they could no longer release information to me,' she said, saying a liaison said the hospital could only release information to Duncan's son Karsiah, 19.

Among 1,450 pages of records, Wureh was listed as the 'primary decision maker' because Duncan was incapable of making decisions for clinical care.

She and her son Josephus Weeks were also listed as hospital contacts and 'consents relatives' by Dr Gary Weinstein, the chief of pulmonology and critical care, two days before Duncan's death.

The first page of the collection of records is addressed to Wureh and states 'additional information may be added to the record.'

After being contacted by the Associated Press Tuesday night, spokesperson Wendell Watson said the hospital 'will be reaching out and providing the requested information.'

Houston attorney Joseph Larsen, who has worked with medical records in past cases, says it's not within the power of the hospital to change who can request and receive records.

'That's absolutely not within the power of the hospital to change that,' he says.

Weeks says Wureh made requests including for records of lab work while visiting Duncan shortly before his death that have gone unfulfilled, along with requests for information on his cremation.

Karsiah Duncan signed documents related to his father's cremation, says George Mason, the pastor of Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancee. The remains are not yet with Duncan.
