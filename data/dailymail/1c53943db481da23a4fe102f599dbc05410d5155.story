Super midwife Kathleen McSherry has retired after delivering a record 7,000 babies.

Colleagues believe Kathleen, 66, from Faifley, West Dunbartonshire, has notched up more births than any other British midwife in a career spanning six decades.

She said: 'It's been a labour of love. Every delivery has been a very special moment for me. Bringing a new life into the world is the best job in the world.'

She continued: 'The sheer joy of being at a family's happiest moment is truly wonderful. I'll miss it so much.'

Kathleen, who is a fan of the hit TV show Call the Midwife, has spent her career in the bustling maternity wards of three busy Glasgow hospitals - Stobhill, The Queen Mother's and the Southern General.

The father of a child she delivered worked out she must have delivered more than 7,000 babies - based on the fact she's delivered three babies per shift on average.

Fellow midwives agree they are unaware of anyone who has helped deliver so many babies.

Kathleen's daughter Ashley, who set up a Facebook page in her honour, said: 'She has enjoyed every one of her days working to deliver babies and we are all very proud of her service to the NHS. I think she will miss it so much now she's retired.'

The mother-of-four and grandmother-of-five has enjoyed a career which mirrors her favourite TV programme, Call The Midwife.

She began her training in 1966 aged just 17, after working as a sales assistant in the former Glen's department store in Glasgow.

During her career there has never been a dull moment.

She has assisted at the births of two babies born in hospital car parks and has even had two children named after her.

'It's a lovely compliment and one that midwives love,' Kathleen said.

She's delivered too many twins to mention and has also delivered countless children and grandchildren of the children she's brought into the world.

'You can plan to have your baby in hospital but they often have minds of their own and arrive at the least expected time,' she said.

'They set the agenda and there is little you can do when a determined baby decides it's time to be born.'

The most magical moment in Kathleen's career was being at the birth of two of her grandchildren

She also had a surprise delivery of her own when she was forced to advise husband Jim, 67, a retired firefighter, what to do when she went into labour with their fourth child Katey.

'It was five in the morning when I woke up in labour and Jim ushered our older kids, Pauline, then nine, Paul, seven, and Ashley two, into the kitchen with breakfast cereal and told them to stay there,' she remembers.

'I knew this baby wasn't waiting, so we called an ambulance hoping I would make it to the Queen Mother's Hospital about four miles away.

'It was a blizzard outside and I hoped it would arrive in time.

'The midwife flying squad was also called - but our wee girl arrived before they got here - and Jim had to do the honours.

'I was at one end issuing instructions to Jim, hoping all was going well down at his end.

'Being a midwife helped, as did having three babies previously!'

The most magical moment of her career was being at the delivery of two grandchildren.

Her daughters Pauline, now 44, and Ashley, 35, wanted their mum by their sides as they gave birth.

'Pauline had a wee boy, Dale, in 1994, and it was magic supporting her throughout the labour,' Kathleen remembers.

'I was thrilled being allowed to assist my second daughter, Ashley's wee boy, Matthew, into the world in 2009.

The saddest moments in Kathleen's career has been when couples have lost babies after years of trying

'I put my hands on her baby when he came out and broke the news to my daughters both times that they'd had boys.

'You worry so much more when your daughter is pregnant and in labour. That's mainly because you know what mums have to endure.

'People say it's just childbirth but they don't call it labour for nothing.. It's exhausting and takes women to the limit of endurance.'

But being a midwife has brought heartache too.

'The saddest have been couples who lost babies after years of trying,' she adds.

'Your heart goes out to them. It is the hardest challenge for any midwife.'

It's been a family career for Kathleen as her mum, Mary, was a nurse during the Second World War and her sister Moira, 68, took the same path.

'I grew up with mum being a nurse and she worked through some really hard times during the War.

'She never complained once about the long hours on old Nightingale wards.

'In fact, she was a great role model for us.'

None of Kathleen's children have followed her into midwifery, though.

'There are so many other career options open to women,' she says.

Daughter Katey, 33, an ASDA section leader, said: 'It's very impressive how long she's been a midwife.

'She is one of the longest serving in Scotland.'

Kathleen's bosses, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are sad to see her leave.

Evelyn Frame, Head of Midwifery at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: 'Kathleen has dedicated her life to delivering babies and supporting new mums and we wish her all the very best on her retirement.'
