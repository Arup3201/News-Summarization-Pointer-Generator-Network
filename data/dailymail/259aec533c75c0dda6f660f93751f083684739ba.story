For people who need a caffeinated kick in the morning or crave a cup of strong coffee when they are far from a kitchen or coffee shop, there is now a unique handheld espresso machine.

Unlike other portable coffee systems, the Minipresso doesn’t use batteries or a plug and instead relies on users pumping the device to brew the coffee to their liking.

It uses coffee grounds or capsules along with precisely 2.4 ounces (68ml) of hot water, which is poured into its main chamber.

The Hong Kong-based company behind the design – which also includes a cup – says: ‘you won’t find better gear to travel light and enjoy a quality espresso away from home.’

The Minispresso machine creates coffee at 116 psi, which is the same pressure produced by traditional espresso machines.

It doesn’t use compressed air or coffee cartridges because experts say they blow cold air into hot water. 

The machine is just under 10 inches tall and includes a built-in cup (pictured left). It  uses normal coffee grounds or capsules along with precisely 2.4 ounces (68g) of hot water, which is poured into its main chamber (pictured right) so people can make coffee on the go

Ingredients needed: 0.25oz (7g) of coffee plus 2.4ounces (68mls) of hot water.

Pump: A pop-out a semi-automatic piston injects small quantities of water into the coffee adapter. Users pump the machine 13 times for weak coffee, 18 times for espresso and 28 times for a double espresso.

Size: 9.7 inches (25cm) tall

Weight: 0.8lbs (363g)

Cost: $39 (£24) plus shipping and taxes

Instead, the device uses a semi-automatic piston to inject small quantities of water into the coffee adapter.

After a few pushes, the optimal pressure for extracting the coffee is achieved and ‘a rich and bold espresso is extracted,’ the company says.

Users can pump the machine 13 times for a tiny shot of coffee, 18 times for espresso and earn a double espresso by pushing the pump 28 times.

There is minimal distance between the water tank and coffee chamber, to avoid losing hear during water displacement.

‘As a result of our cares to build the perfect device, Minipresso produces at ambient condition 24°C (75°F), an espresso at perfect temperature 67°C (152°F in cup) with a nice compact and persistent crema on top,’ the company says.

The pump can be easily locked in place and pushed to release and the whole device has been designed to be as compact as possible, measuring 9.7 inches (25cm) tall and weighing 0.8lbs (363g).

‘Minipresso has been designed to be the smallest, lightest and most versatile handheld espresso machine. It's also the first of its kind to integrate an espresso cup,’ the company says.

The makers of the machine recommend that users clean the cup and coffee adapter after each use, but stressed that the device will not be dishwasher proof.

The device is available to pre-order for $39 (£24) plus shipping and taxes, as it will be sent from Hong Kong in early 2015.
