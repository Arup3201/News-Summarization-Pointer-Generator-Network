Ronny Deila insists he wants the future of Kris Commons fixed before the January transfer window.

Last season’s Scottish player of the year is now in the final year of his contract and can speak with other clubs in the new year.

Bolton Wanderers, now managed by Neil Lennon, are keen to secure Commons on a pre-contract agreement.

Despite racking up four straight wins in the playmaker’s absence through injury, Deila says Commons still has a role to play in the club’s future and wants things settled sooner rather than later.

‘Of course we want it sorted,’ said the Norwegian. ‘Everyone wants that.

‘It’s up to the club and Kris to get an agreement.’

Asked if fixing something before January was his wish, Deila added: ‘Of course that’s the case. There’s nothing new there. The only new thing is his injury.

‘Again we need to assess all the time what is going on. Older players are easier to deal with than 19-year-old players.

‘We have more control over the situation when players are older and also you assess more things as they get older.

‘Kris is important in the group and in the team.’

Ruled out with an awkward injury from recent games, Deila is hopeful Commons is on the mend.

‘We won’t take any chances and there has been improvement so hopefully he will be in the team quickly.’

Injury-plagued Dutch winger Derk Boerrigter shows no sign of returning to first-team action before 2015 after undergoing surgery on a knee injury.

‘He has jumper’s knee and has had this for a while. He’s had an operation in Sweden and will be out for two months. We won’t see him before January.’

Scotland forward Commons has scored lots of important goals for Celtic over the last few seasons

Celtic’s home clash with Partick Thistle has been rescheduled for Wednesday, December 3. The fixture was originally due to take place on August 9.
