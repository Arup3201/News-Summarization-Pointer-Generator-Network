It is 4am, the old centre back has not slept a wink. His mind is racing; training drills, team selection, travel plans.

It is now 6am, still without any sleep but energised and excited, the young coach is up and ready for the day ahead, his first as a football manager.

Sam Collins – the Hartlepool United defender, reserve-team coach and caretaker boss - is 37 years old.

Sam Collins is in temporary charge at Hartlepool following the departure of Colin Cooper earlier this month

The club's form has picked up since Collins took control, and last week they beat Exeter City 2-1 away

Collins currently fulfills the roles of defender, reserve-team coach and caretaker manager at Hartlepool

He is both a veteran – 593 professional appearances – and a rookie, now 12 days and two games in to his temporary tenure.

He is also one of just eight Englishmen under 40 currently taking charge of a League club.

None of those won an international cap. Only two of them – Garry Monk and Shaun Derry – played in the Premier League, albeit a handful of times.

So where are those trophy-laden England stars? Why aren’t they taking on the challenge at Victoria Park?

Answer: they don’t need it. David Beckham, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Jamie Carragher – they don’t need Southend away on a wet Tuesday night, they don’t even need Southampton away on a sunny Saturday afternoon.

Swansea boss Garry Monk is currently the youngest manager in the Premier League and will turn 36 in March

Notts County boss Shaun Derry is one of eight Englishmen under the age of 40 taking charge of a League club

The likes of David Beckham and Gary Neville don't need to travel to Southend on a cold and wet Tuesday night

Rather, the next generation of English coaches – an endangered species according to FA Commission reports – are guys like Collins. A father of four, he needs it. More importantly, he wants it.

‘If I’m asked to do this job, then I would love to,’ says the man who has scribbled a dossier on training sessions and tactics garnered from a 20-year playing career and geared towards this day.

‘I’ve always wanted to be a coach and a manager. I’ve said it since I was in my 20s. People used to think I was daft. But this is what I’ve always wanted to do. Yeah, my phone hasn’t stopped and I’ve hardly slept, but I’m loving every minute.’

Collins – who will complete his UEFA Pro Licence next summer - adds: ‘I think it is players like myself who are the English coaches of the future.

‘Look at Eddie Howe at Bournemouth, he’s the perfect example - players from the lower leagues with a lot of experience. So there is a place there for young coaches but you need that chance because I still think there are too many foreign managers and players in English football.’

QPR boss Harry Redknapp agrees that managers that work their way up are the future of British coaching

In his latest book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, Redknapp says Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal could not have matched Steve Bruce's achievements at Hull in recent seasons

Harry Redknapp agrees with Collins.

In his new book, A Man Walks On To a Pitch, he writes: ‘Louis van Gaal couldn’t have done a better job with Hull City than Steve Bruce did last year. Yet did his heroics in the League and FA Cup create even a ripple at Old Trafford?

‘OK, a few times in his career it hasn’t worked out but that would be true of Van Gaal, too, if he had spent his managerial life at clubs like Sheffield United, Huddersfield Town or Hull. I don’t understand why owners suddenly lost faith in British managers.

‘And where’s the next generation of English managers coming from? Will the current top tier of English players go through the leagues to prove themselves, as Bruce has done? Lads who have had 10 seasons at Chelsea in the Abramovich years won’t get out of bed for what the manager of Exeter City gets paid.’

Or, indeed, for what the manager of Hartlepool gets paid. They are now searching for their fifth boss in three years. Among the applications there will be those from abroad and former Hearts chief Csaba Laszlo is one of the frontrunners. Even Sven-Goran Eriksson expressed an interest two years ago.

But perhaps their best bet already resides within the Vic.

Former defender Colin Cooper quit Hartlepool following a 3-0 home defeat to Carlisle United in October

Hartlepool were without a win in five and bottom of the Football League when Colin Cooper quit earlier this month. There is dissatisfaction among fans. They have threatened to boycott the next home game in protest against Norwegian owners Increased Oil Recovery and a perceived lack of investment in the playing squad.

None of that, however, will deter Collins – and many others – from putting forward their case to be installed on a permanent basis.

The caretaker’s accent is on youth, evidenced by an XI which included five players 21 or under during Saturday’s 2-1 victory at Exeter City, a result which lifted the gloom and elevated their league standing by three places.

They entertain Luton this weekend, but not before Collins took the reserves to Doncaster on Wednesday afternoon. He is already immersed in the role.

‘I love this club. I’ve been here a long time and I know how the fans think,’ says the Pontefract-born defender who signed from Hull in 2008.

Collins congratulates Jonathan Franks after Hartlepool's victory away to Exeter City on October 11

‘Hartlepool is the same as where I’m from – working-class people who want their team to have effort, energy and determination. I’m from that background and I understand it.

‘The young lads here are honest, hard-working and desperate to do well. I’m not afraid to play them one little bit. I know what they’re capable of.

‘As soon as I was asked by the chairman to take care of things then I knew within 10 minutes who I wanted to play.

‘One lad, Kieran Green, came up to me and gave me a hug when I told him he was going to make his debut and he did the same after the game. He’s infectious and desperate to be a footballer. I love that.’

Collins, too, shares the hunger of his young player. For while he may not be sleeping, it hasn’t stopped him dreaming of becoming the club’s manager.
