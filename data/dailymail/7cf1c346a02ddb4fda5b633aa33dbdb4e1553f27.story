Three grey men in grey T-shirts delivered a grey document on Thursday aimed at redefining the England football team as something a little less bulldog and a little more greyhound.

Billed as 'England DNA: Evolving. Developing. Winning', it is the product of 12 months of hiring and firing and restructuring behind the scenes by Dan Ashworth, the FA's director of elite development and will involve giving the players memory-chip wristbands which they can access back at their clubs so they can remember the work they have done with their country.

Ashworth has kept his profile low since replacing Sir Trevor Brooking in this role, busily putting things in place and this was his coming out party, formalising the power-shift behind the scenes.

He presented the document with U21 manager Gareth Southgate and head of player and coach development Matt Crocker, recruited from Southampton, where the prolific Academy is under the authority of Les Reed, former technical director of the FA, who once worked with Howard Wilkinson to produce a document very like this one.

The irony must have been lost somewhere between Wembley and St George's Park, where Ashworth will extend his DNA vision to 1,500 coaches from the FA's Licensed Coaches' Club who will gather, over the weekend.

It is simply a collection of commonsense ideas committed to print after thorough research, including studies into how other nations do things - six in Europe and three in South America.

It may help coaches at all levels to have a point of reference about what the international teams are striving for, and it may help players of different ages to have a memory stick on a wristband which reminds them of what playing for England is about, should they chose to plug it into their laptop or tablet.

But, in truth, this is another largely underwhelming document trying to be all things to as many people as possible, without causing offence.

Ashworth's team want England want to break from the traditional blood and sweat, but not forget about it. They want to work with the clubs, but want more players to be released by clubs to boost experience on an international stage.

If they want the 'golden thread' to run through the youth ranks to the senior team, the release of players by the clubs is the key. We will see how Southgate gets on when he selects a squad for the U21 Euros next year.

It is hoped the ideas may help coaches at all levels have a point of reference about what the international team is striving for

To increase the number of times a player samples international football, Ashworth has introduced U15, U18 and U20 age groups. At some expense, the U20s have a full programme of fixtures, but will not play a competitively until 2017 at the earliest, since they have not qualified for next year's World Cup in New Zealand.

They want players to be comfortable with the ball - and without it. They want them to be tactically aware and flexible and technically adept. They want them to 'intelligently dominate possession'. They want pride and passion and they want high standards of behaviour. Who doesn't?

The FA will provide a clear coaching plan – focusing on eight positions on the field and phases of play - and the best care and support. They took a teacher with the squad to the U17 Euros in Malta, this year to help four players taking GCSEs. Chelsea's Dominic Solanke even stayed in Malta to sit an exam on the day his team-mates travelled home.

The principles are admirable. Most of it has been heard before in different guises. England boasted they were the best prepared team at the World Cup in Brazil. They were also among the first to leave for home.

Ultimately, what England need to win a World Cup is more and better players. Ashworth admits 90 per cent of player development in England is done by the clubs, which leaves him addressing the final 10 per cent, which adapts them for international football.

The Premier League is two years into their Elite Player Performance Plan, their own pathway to more and better home-grown footballers. They all claim to consult closely, but do they, really?

Clouding the issue further is the commission launched by FA chairman Greg Dyke with a view to creating an England team capable of winning the World Cup in 2022, by recommending feeder clubs.

And a Code of Conduct, introduced by Dyke's predecessor David Bernstein, to improve behaviour.

Blueprints we have aplenty. And now we have another. Or is it grey?
