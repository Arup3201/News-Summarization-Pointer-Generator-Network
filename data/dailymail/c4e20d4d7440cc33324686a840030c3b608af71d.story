Juan Mata says it will be impossible not to cast his mind back to the last World Cup final when Spain face Holland on Friday but he also warns that the holders have not just come to Brazil to hand over their crown.

'Right now I’m not thinking about the last final but when I’m there out on the pitch and I have them in front of me, I’m sure the memories will all come flooding back,' he says.

Mata was on the bench as Andres Iniesta scored the most famous goal in Spain’s history against the Dutch in Johannesburg four years ago.

He remembers: 'When he scored, the first thing I did was look across to the linesman to see if he had lifted his flag, to make sure there was no offside. Then I looked up at the scoreboard and saw ‘115m, 1-0.’

'The time spent waiting for the final whistle seemed so long. We were trying to pressure the fourth official to make sure that he didn’t add on too much time. Those final five minutes were torture.'

Holland can take a revenge of sorts tomorrow in Salvador but Mata warns that despite winning the last three major tournaments Spain have not lost their hunger and that even their older players are ready to give everything again, one more time.

He says: 'When you look at the ages of some of the key players, this is probably the last World Cup for them. But they will want to play at this tournament, even if it is their last, and I am sure they will want to say to the world: ‘we’re still here’.

'And then the young players coming up behind them have a brilliant future. They more or less play the same style of football and they can give the national team continuity.'

One of those young players will be Mata who says: 'People ask has the motivation gone with so many tournaments won but I’m only 26. It doesn’t take any motivation away from me. It makes me want to live it all again.'

Mata’s World Cup chances were almost ruined by falling out of favour at Chelsea. He found a new home at Manchester United but joined the club at a difficult moment and could easily have missed the final cut.'

'Sometimes [when playing for Manchester United] I thought ‘I have to prove a point to the national team here’ but it’s much better to go out onto the pitch and play as you always do for your club and let things happen naturally. It’s no good thinking: "I’ve got to play well to go to the World Cup".'

There was silence from Del Bosque in those difficult months. It’s not the Spain coach’s style to be in contact with the country’s foreign legion but when it came to picking his 23 he had no doubts about including the United midfielder just as he had done in the Confederations Cup final one year ago when Mata started the final against Brazil.

Can Spain put right what went wrong last time in the Maracanà?

'Lots of things went against us that day,' he says. 'The physical difference between the two sides and the atmosphere both worked for Brazil and we had that bit of bad luck when David Luiz cleared one off the line from Pedro.

'I think if we had scored then, it would have taken the edge off of the atmosphere and the game. The stadium was incredible, and there was so much noise.

'Then they scored two goals while we missed out on that Pedro chance, and that’s where the game got away from us. They will be among the favourites again but so will we.'

Mata dismisses the idea that the Confederations Cup defeat showed that Spain had been ‘found out’ as a team with only one way of playing.

'I think we do have variation within our game. We have players who can open up the pitch when the game is tight. We have strikers who are physically strong and we have full-backs who can overlap.

'I think the coach has a very clear footballing identity, a way of playing that we all believe in, but I also think that we have other options. Looking back on the Brazil game, for example, they were better than us. It wasn’t a lack of variety or an inability to play another way.'

This time Spain have a ‘Brazilian’ of their own with Diego Costa offering something different in attack.

'In principle, he’s different,' says Mata. 'If you ask the strikers who have played for Spain over the last few years they will tell you that it’s a very hard job. The way that Spain plays makes it difficult for them.

That is why Cesc [Fabregas] or [David] Silva have played in attack and it’s been a good solution. But I think Costa can bring what he has brought to Atlético. Goals. That’s the fundamental thing: goals, goals, goals.

'He can battle with the central defenders. He can receive the ball with his back to goal and bring others in. He can get behind defences although that is harder when you play for Spain because teams sit so deep.

'But he played fantastically this season. His team has played incredibly well and he was often their most important player. He’s done enough to be called up, that’s for sure.'

Back in Spain expectations will also be high and only heightened by the memories a game against the Dutch will bring to the surface. 'People get used to winning; it becomes all or nothing,' says Mata of the increased demands back home.

Could that same expectation count even more against Brazil than it will against Spain?

'I spoke to Oscar about this some months ago and he said: ‘Everyone is expecting us to win’. I think that’s a double-edge sword. It can really carry you through out on the pitch and give you incredible energy but it things don’t go well then it’s an extra pressure.”

Favourites: Spain are likely to have to face their Confederations Cup conquerors Brazil if they are to defend their crown

Mata says recreation will again be important as Spain try to distance themselves from the pressure.

'We had a games room four years ago with cards, pool, table tennis and it helped get us through. I would play table-tennis with Sergi Busquets and Gerard Piqué who’s very good. Sergio Ramos played. It was very competitive.'

Games time will once again help players switch off from the demands of being the team everyone wants to beat. No country has ever won four straight tournaments.

Atmosphere: Mata believes keeping up team spirit will be key to dealing with World Cup pressure

To do it, and do it in style would probably not only mean Spain kept their ‘world’s greatest’ crown but also inherited the 1970 Brazil team’s ‘all-time greatest’ title.

'In 2012 we realised that it was not enough to win or play well. We had to win and play well. That’s great because it shows that people have high expectations of us and that comes from what we have achieved before.

'But it also means that people sometimes forget that winning is not so easy. The demands are huge and what we want to achieve is huge too.'
