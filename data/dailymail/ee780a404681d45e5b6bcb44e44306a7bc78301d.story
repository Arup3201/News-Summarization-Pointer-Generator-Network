Anderson Cooper was living it up on Wednesday night at the raucous opening of his boyfriend's hip new gay bar.

The CNN anchor was pictured grinning from ear-to-ear and wearing his favorite New Orleans PD T-shirt alongside fellow TV host Andy Cohen at Atlas Social Club in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan.

The private party at the bar, described by the owners as a 'cross between a gay speakeasy and a vintage gym', was packed with celebrity 'friends and family' including Whoopi Goldberg, Alan Cumming, Kelly Ripa, Ellen Barkin and singer Eve.

Atlas Social Club on Ninth Avenue, between 50th and 51st Streets, opens to the public on September 20 but a glimpse inside during the Fashion Week soirée revealed dimly lit lounges, plush sofas and wallpaper made from vintage fitness magazines.

Andy Cohen posted the pic of himself with Cooper on his Instagram with the message: 'Lots of fun last night at #AtlasSocialClub opening with @AndersonCooper - it's a fun new bar on 9th Avenue!'

The snap of the gray-haired stars, who showed off their gym-honed physiques in tight T-shirts,  immediately got a ream of responses from adoring fans.
