A teenage boy has admitted religiously harassing a McDonald's worker - by persistently mocking her because she is a Pagan.

The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, visited the fast food restaurant frequently over a period of more than six weeks to taunt the woman over her beliefs.

The case is understood to be the first in the UK to involve a case of religious harassment against a Pagan.

The boy, who lives in Lawford, Essex, pleaded guilty to religiously aggravated harassment at Colchester youth court on Wednesday.

Religion: A 16-year-old boy has admitted religiously harassing a Pagan in Essex. Pagans, such as these at Stonehenge, worship a variety of deities

Magistrates banned him from contacting the woman and gave him a three month referral order, which means he must report to a panel of youth workers and may be forced to do unpaid work.

The court heard how the boy  repeatedly went to the McDonald's restaurant in Colchester, Essex, between December 24, 2001 and February 18 and harassed the female employee because she was a Pagan.

Paganism, the followers of which include druids, shamans and heathens, is recognised as a religion under UK law.

Prosecutor Simon Newell said: 'Religiously aggravated harassment is an unusual offence - the first I have dealt with, especially one where perhaps not everyone would consider it a religion, but it is deemed to be so.

'The defendant has found out others have called her a Pagan and he has jumped on the bandwagon.Â 

Diverse: The Pagan community features a range of people, including druids, shamans and heathens. Paganism is classed as a religion

Banned: The boy, 16, has been banned from eating in the McDonald's in Colchester, Essex

'He was soon made aware of the effect it was having by the victim and senior staff.

'He knew this was unacceptable and then continued.

'He accepted in interview he did it to annoy her.'

However, Mr Newell added: 'He did not know it constituted religious aggravation and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.'

Paganism describes a group of contemporary religions based on a reverence for nature.

It encompasses a diverse community, including Wiccans, druids, shamans, sacred ecologists and heathens.

The majority of Pagans share an ecological vision that comes from the belief in the spirituality of the natural world.

Pagans do not worship the devil or practice 'black magic' and their practices do not involve 
harming people or animals.

The number of Pagans in Great Britain is estimated at between 50,000 and 200,000.

The Prison Service recognised Paganism as a religion in 2000.

Laura Austin, mitigating, said: 'He is apologetic and did not realise Paganism was a recognised religion.

'The teasing was going to a level where the victim got very upset about it.

'His parents are not happy with him and have imposed their own curfew.

'You do wonder if the employers could or should have done more to prevent the behaviour.'

The court was told the teenager had been banned from eating in the restaurant and was only allowed to order food to takeaway.

The boy had an existing referral order, which magistrates extended by three months.

He was also given a restraining order, banning contact between the teenager and his victim until November.

After he was sentenced, the boy offered to write a letter of apology to his victim.

No order was made for costs or compensation.

Cas Morehan, the franchise holder of the McDonald's store, said: 'Unfortunately there are instances where staff are subjected to harassment and abuse by customers.'
