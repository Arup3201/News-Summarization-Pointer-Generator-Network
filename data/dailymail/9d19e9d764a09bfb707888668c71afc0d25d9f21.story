India have been tucking into England's bowling all the way through this one-day international series and they were pictured gorging on fast food during practice.

Virat Kohli and his team-mates seemed confident enough ahead of the final ODI to fill their faces with McDonald's and Nando's on the Headingley outfield.

The pictures seems like a throwback to the days before dieticians and nutritionists were commonplace in top-class sport and it is rare to see elite stars shovelling down burgers and fries.

However, India's ability to score quick runs on this tour has earned them the right to eat a bit of fast food before a dead rubber.

Their nutritional habits seem a long way from England's approach ahead of the Ashes Down Under, when they were ridiculed for their 82-page menu, including such delicacies as quinoa.

England have barely given the tourists any food for thought in the previous three matches and were hammered at Edgbaston on Tuesday, losing by nine wickets with 19-and-a-half overs to go. 

Moeen Ali thinks the hosts can learn a lot from India - but he did not mean in their refuelling habits.

He said: 'Me sitting on the sidelines for the first two games, watching the way Indians bat, you can learn a lot from the way they approach it, with no fear and just back themselves.

'If there is a risk, they just take it. Sometimes it doesn't come off but as a team if we can all do that and execute the plan like I say then we will be fine.'

In the seconds: Kohli gestures to the dressing room while patting his stomach - perhaps he was asking for more?
