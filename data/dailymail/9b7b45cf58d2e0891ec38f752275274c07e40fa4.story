Luka Modric has signed a new deal at Real Madrid to keep him at the Santiago Bernabeu for the next four years.

The Croatian midfielder joined Real Madrid from Tottenham in 2012 and signed a five-year contract.

However, the 28-year-old has agreed better terms and an extra year on his deal with the Champions League winners.

Modric has become a regular in Carlo Ancelotti's side in the Spanish capital.

Staying put: Luka Modric has agreed a new contract with European champions Real Madrid

He started in the first leg of Real's Spanish Super Cup tie against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday, which ended 1-1, and helped his team to Champions League and Copa del Rey glory last season.

'Real Madrid CF announces the extension of Luka Modric's contract, linking him to the club for the next four seasons,' a short statement from the club read. 

In his 106 matches for Real Madrid, Modric has also won the European Super Cup and a Spanish Super Cup.

All six goals the Croatian midfielder has scored for Real Madrid have come from outside the penalty area.
