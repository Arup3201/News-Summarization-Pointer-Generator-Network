Luke Walker is accompanied by his supporters as he leaves Heraklion Mixed Criminal Court in Crete today where he is on trial for murder

There were dramatic scenes in a 
courtroom in Crete today as the trial of a British man accused of 
murdering his girlfriend on the island was told of allegations he had beaten her twice 
before.

Luke Walker is alleged by Greek 
prosecutors to have beaten 20-year-old Chelsea Hyndman, leaving her with
injuries which are said to have led to her death three years ago.

Miss Hyndman was admitted to hospital 
in Heraklion, Crete, with abdominal pains on May 16, 2010, and died the 
following day.

Heraklion Mixed Criminal Court heard she died as a result
of acute peritonitis.

Walker - an electrician who was living
in the resort town of Malia where he and Chelsea worked in bars - 
claims she fell during a night out.

He denies one count of murder, and had
wiped tears from his eyes as a close friend told his trial today of the
plans the couple had for their future together before Miss Hyndman's 
death.

But separate evidence in the form of 
written statements read to the court purportedly from one woman who 
signed her name only as 'Jessie' and another from a man named as 'Peter 
Rogers' alleged there had previously been violence in their 
relationship.

The typed letter from Jessie, dated 
June 14 2010, said she knew the couple and that when Walker was sober he
was okay, but when they went out drinking he was jealous of other men 
talking to Miss Hyndman.

It claimed to know of two other times when Walker beat Miss Hyndman and kicked her in the stomach.

The letter added: 'All do not know what goes on behind closed doors and they are too scared to come out to tell you.'

Walker's friends and family shouted out in court as it was read and asked: 'Jessie? Who's Jessie?'

Another document submitted to the 
court that was sent to Greek Police from Peter Rogers said he had 
overheard a conversation between Walker's father Patrick and a friend at
an event in the West Midlands in which he is claimed to have said that 
Walker admitted to him he had hit Miss Hyndman when he was drunk.

George Pyromallis, Walker's defence 
barrister, submitted to the court that the documents could easily be 
false and he was uneasy about them being allowed in evidence.

'It is troubling how this paper can appear in the case file and it could easily be forged,' he said.

The court was also read a statement 
from Eda Quirici, a neighbour of Walker and Miss Hyndman, who said she 
often heard 'intense arguments' between the pair.

She lived in the apartment below 
them, and said: 'These arguments were so intense, so fierce, that I 
could not sleep for the noise.'

In her statement she said that though
she was not absolutely certain of the date, she remembers hearing an 
argument in the apartment at around 4am on May 12 when she returned home
from her bar job.

'I heard the girl screaming like someone does like when someone is being chased or being beaten.

'I heard furniture being dragged about like when someone is trying to chase a person.'

Earlier Walker had broken down in 
tears as he listened to a friend of Miss Hyndman tell the court how the 
suspect had wanted to marry and have children with the girlfriend he is 
accused of murdering.

Lyndsay Williamson, who had been 
friends with Miss Hyndman since 2007, said the couple had fallen in love
quickly and their two-year relationship was strong.

Fighting back tears she told the court: 'He loved her 100 per cent.

'My impression of Luke was the same as
Chelsea's impression of Luke - they wanted to be together, they wanted a
future together, they wanted to get married, they wanted to have 
children.'

Walker, 25, of Brierley Hill near 
Dudley, West Midlands, who sat behind Miss Williamson in court, put his 
hands to his eyes and quietly cried as he listened to her evidence.

The court heard that he and Miss 
Hyndman, of Castleford, West Yorkshire, were 'very much in love' and 
'felt invincible'.

Walker maintains his innocence -
claiming Miss Hyndman sustained her injuries after falling over on a
night out

Miss Williamson said that in 2009 the 
couple left Malia and returned to England to find work and also to work 
on their relationship because they had been having some difficulties.

She said they decided to go home for some space and because they wanted to make things work.

She added: 'They were a little bit jealous of each other's past relationships with other people but not with any malice.

'I can't explain it any more than that they were a very young couple.'

Walker and Miss Hyndman returned to 
Malia together in 2010 because they felt they had worked through their 
issues, they missed their friends, and were happier abroad.

Miss Williamson said Miss Hyndman had 
been like her 'little sister' and she would have known if anything bad 
had happened to her or if anyone had hurt her.

The court heard evidence yesterday from Louise Purdy, who had been on a night out with Miss Hyndman on May 6.

During the night Miss Hyndman had 
fallen over on a cobbled street, landing with her left hand under her 
body near her stomach area, Miss Purdy told the court.

The court heard that as the night wore on she told friends she was okay but had hurt her stomach a little.

Delayed: Walker's trial started Crete yesterday - three years after his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman died

Miss Williamson said that by May 11 she noticed a difference in Miss Hyndman.

They had both spent time at the beach 
and had got badly burned by the sun and later that day, when the pair 
met up to go for a few drinks, Miss Hyndman 'seemed so out of it and 
disorientated'.

Miss Williamson saw her again on May 
12 and said Miss Hyndman was being sick and had stomach cramps and 
thought she had sunstroke.

She briefly saw her again as she was 
going into hospital and asked if she wanted her to go too. Miss Hyndman 
replied: 'I just want to be with Luke', the court heard.

James Sharp, Miss Williamson's partner, said Walker and Miss Hyndman's relationship was strong.
'It was a good relationship,' he told the court.

'We did a lot of things together as partners, me and my partner and Luke and Chelsea together.
'Going round for barbecues...it was a good relationship.'

Case: Prosecutors claim Walker punched or kicked Miss Hyndman in her stomach causing her fatal injuries

Mr Sharp and Miss Williamson lived in an apartment opposite the couple and he told the court he would have been in a position to hear if they had an argument at home.

He said he was in bed at home on the night that it is alleged there was a row between the pair.

He was asked if it was possible if there had been a 'huge argument or a tremendous noise' that he would have been woken up, and he answered 'possibly'.

A letter was also read to the court that Miss Hyndman's mother Heather, who was in court, wrote to Walker when he was in prison. He has since been granted bail by the court.

In it she wrote: 'Luke, I know you and Chelsea love each other dearly.'I can't believe it's ended like this.

'I'm sorry I haven't come to see you, I hope you can understand why. There's so many things going through my mind.'

She said: 'Chelsea's coming home with me tomorrow' and said she would take care of her.

She told Walker: 'I hope things work out for you' and added: 'I hope things will end soon so my baby can rest in peace.'

The trial continues.
