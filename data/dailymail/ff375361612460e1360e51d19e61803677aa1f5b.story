A marathon runner wearing an animal costume is not an unfamiliar sight but Paul Goldstein's tiger suit has not only run nine marathons - it has travelled around the globe.

Mr Goldstein, 52, from Wimbledon has already climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, visited the Taj Mahal, sprinted over snow and raced through nine marathons - all dressed in the outfit - which is 9ft high.

Over the past week, Mr Goldstein has been training near the Taj Mahal preparing himself for a week-long charity challenge in April.

Mr Goldstein has spent the past week training near the Taj Mahal preparing himself for a week-long charity challenge. The challenge will involve running the Brighton Marathon, walking to London and then running the London Marathon in the space of one week

In between the two marathons, Mr Goldstein who is a safari guide for travel company Exodus, will be presenting a lecture at London's Royal Institution on on the endangered animals. He is fighting for more action to be taken to stop the poaching of the wild animals

Over the last four years, he has raised over £100,000 for his beloved tiger charity Worth More Alive which is located in Bandhavgarh, northern India. The money he has raised has been used for schools, digging boreholes and clinics

Mr Goldstein has spent the last four years in the suit to promote a cause close to his heart - the plight of tigers.

Next month he will embark on a seven day mission which will involve running the Brighton marathon, then making his way to London on foot before running the London marathon on April 13 - all within the space of a week.

Mr Goldstein is fighting for more action to be taken to stop the poaching of the wild animals. Over the last four years, he has raised over £100,000 for his beloved tiger charity Worth More Alive which is located in Bandhavgarh, northern India.

The money he has raised has been used for schools, digging boreholes and clinics.

Mr Goldstein said: 'I have two wonderful young sons.

'I would like them to see a tiger in the wild when they are a little older. Currently I am not that hopeful thanks to the ravages of traditional Chinese medicine and rampant poaching.

Come rain or shine: Mr Goldstein is no fairweather runner, the tiger suit has been dragged through all conditions, from blistering heat to freezing temperatures

The tiger suit has climbed dizzying heights. Pictured here are Mr Goldstein and his suit at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. The Tanazanian mountain is more than 19,000ft high. Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa

The safari guide is outspoken on the topic of poaching. He said: 'It is all very well the Royals getting awfully cross about the illegal trade in animal parts but we have to do more than anger and celebrity crocodile tears. It is about shaming the perpetrators of this despicable trade and then going after the poachers.'

Mr Goldstein wants to make locals aware that although short-term profit can be gained from poaching the animals, the long-term economic benefits to the community could be far greater if they protect the species. People from across the world travel to Asia to see the endangered big cats - without them, the tourism industry could suffer

He is currently in Bandhavgarth with a touring party and the suit has come with him, of course.

During the course of the trip he will play a charity cricket game to raise money for Worth More Alive as well as visiting the 278 sq miles Bandhavgarth National Park.

It is regarded as one of the best national parks in India to spot Asian tigers.

Mr Goldstein, who has been meeting many of the locals during his trip, said: 'People in the small village of Tala adjoining the park realise how important their striped neighbours are and how much they need to be looked after. The tigers are their own meal ticket.'

Worth More Alive: Mr Goldstein's charity aims to prevent the poaching of tigers and inform others about the big cats

People from across the world travel to Asia to see the endangered big cats - without them, the tourism industry could suffer.

'One tiger on the slab ready for the illegal market is worth about $30,000 (£17,939). One intact living a proper innings is probably worth at least a hundred times that amount, which is why they are Worth More Alive.'
