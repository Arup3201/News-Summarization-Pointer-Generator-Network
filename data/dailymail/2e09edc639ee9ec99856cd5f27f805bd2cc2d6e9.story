The National Rifle Association has launched an iPhone app that lets users fire 'true to life firearms'.

The powerful gun lobby's app, NRA: Practice Range, includes a shooting range feature and can be used by children.

The timing of the release is controversial in light of the ongoing debate in America about gun control following the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut.

In the wake of the incident, the NRA linked the shootings to violent video games, leading some to label their new venture as hypocritical.

Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, pointed to 'vicious, violent video games' in remarks last month.

The powerful gun lobby's new app, rated 4+, has been described as the group's 'new mobile nerve centre'.

The app's description says it 'offers a 3D 
shooting game that instills safe and responsible ownership through fun 
challenges and realistic simulations'.

It also states: 'It strikes the right balance of gaming and safety 
education, allowing you to enjoy the most authentic experience 
possible.'

The app is free to download from Apple's ios store, but users can pay a $0.99 fee once downloaded to access more advanced weapons.

In the game users are provided with three levels in which to shoot: an indoor range, an outdoor range and a skeet shoot.

The app also features gun safety tips and information about firearms laws. Throughout the game various tips flash upon the screen, including the advice 'Use only the correct ammunition for your gun' and 'always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction'.

NRA officials travelled to the White House only days ago to discuss gun control.

Vice President Joe Biden is currently heading up a taskforce looking at gun control in America, while the New York senate today passed a gun control bill.

After the Washington meeting, the NRA's Wayne LaPierre said: 'We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.'

'While claiming that no policy proposals would be 'prejudged,' this Task Force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners — honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans.

'It is unfortunate that this Administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems. We will not allow law-abiding gun owners to be blamed for the acts of criminals and madmen.'
