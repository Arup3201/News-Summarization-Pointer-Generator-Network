An award-winning author has criticised a top hotel after it used images of scantily-clad female construction workers for a new advert.

Jeanette Winterson, 55, author of Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, hit out at Malmaison on Piccadilly in Manchester for its advertising hoarding.

The large board, which also features beefy male models, is covering up construction currently taking place at the hotel.

Winterson claims that the billboards, which also feature beefy male models, contribute to the issue of women being bombarded with negative and conflicting messages about sexuality

The author, who regularly stays at the hotel, claims that the photographs contribute to the issue of women being bombarded with negative and conflicting messages about sexuality and gender roles.  

Winterson, who teaches new writing at the University of Manchester, said the city has 25 Nobel prize winners and is the cornerstone of the Industrial Revolution so should be the place to encourage women into traditionally male-dominated professions.

She said: 'Plenty of women on business stay at the Mal.

'To get to their hotel room at the end of a long day they must take in, or blank out, the message that women at work are really soft-porn babes.

'Suppose you are a girl who wants to go into the manual trades? Does the image of a skinny model in a strapless frock, pouting with a spanner, do anything for your self-confidence and ambition?

'The hard-hat babes send out a message that aligns with male fantasy not female reality.'

Winterson says that such photographs promote the idea that 'women at work are really soft-porn babes'

'This message,' the author says, 'aligns with male fantasy, not female reality'

She also claims that the adverts contribute to the debate on equal pay, rape and domestic violence, anorexia and self-harm, and prostitution.

'The joke is that as Britain falls down the equality ladder behind Rwanda and Nicaragua, and Victoria Beckham is named entrepreneur of the year for dressing us all in size zero - the nearest most women will get to being on the board is a strapless dress and a hard hat outside Malmaison,' she added

Kate Loyd, from the Construction Industry Training Board, also slammed the image: 'The picture on the hoarding of Manchester's Malmaison hotel was shocking, depressing and highly insulting to women working in construction.' 

MailOnline Travel has contacted Malmaison for comment.
