Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler tonight issued a writ against Closer magazine for picturing her in a bikini on a luxury beach holiday.

It is just under a month since the glossy revealed that Ms Trierweiler’s ex-boyfriend, President Francois Hollande, was cheating on her with the actress Julie Gayet.

Photographs published in Closer showed the portly Socialist visiting a Paris love nest on a moped and wearing a crash helmet as a disguise.

Ms Trierweiler was so shocked by the images that she checked into a public hospital for eight days complaining of stress, before Mr Hollande separated from her - effectively ‘firing’ her as first lady.

Now Ms Trierweiler, who turns 49 this month, is on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, lapping up the sun with two girlfriends.

She is pictured in the latest edition of closer in a two-piece bikini, swimming and walking around the sunbeds of her hotel, where presidential villas cost more than £1,500 pounds per night.

Her fellow holidaymakers are Valerie de Senneville, the wife of French labour minister Michel Sapin, and Saida Jawad, girlfriend of the actor Gerard Jugnot.

All of them spent New Year together at la Lanterne, the hugely luxurious presidential home in Versailles, west of Paris, where Ms Trierweiler also went to recuperate following her time in hospital.

Ms Trierweiler confirmed tonight that her lawyers back in France had now issued a writ for an ‘attack on private life’.

This is despite the fact that she is on the staff of Paris Match magazine, which is notorious for running photos of the rich and famous while off duty.

Match is full of pictures of public figures on the beach every week, but in 2012 Ms Trierweiler successfully sued other magazines for picturing both her and Mr Hollande in their beach wear.

Paris Match also ran the pictures, but Ms Trierweiler did not take action agains them, arguing that they did not use them on their cover.

At the time many believed that Mr Hollande had staged the ‘shorts and bikini’ photo-shoot to prove that was still ‘very much in love’ with his controversial girlfriend.

The couple had been trying to play down speculation that Mr Hollande had threatened to dump his live-in lover.

Ms Trierweiler has now been kicked out of the Elysee Palace and is now living in a flat in Paris’s 15th arrondissement.

She is said to be planning a book about her 19 months as first lady - something which Mr Hollande is said to be extremely worried about.
