So this week's big thing is to add up how much Brendan Rodgers has spent at Liverpool and conclude that he's useless.

I'm all for scrutinising players, managers and others in the game – that's what I do.

But it's always good to retain a bit of perspective when throwing that spotlight on some of the people involved at the sharp end.

I'm amazed how quickly some people have forgotten how brilliantly Rodgers did with Liverpool last season.

They were a joy to watch, in fact his Liverpool team last season were the pioneers of the new attacking style adopted by the Premier League.

Of course Luis Suarez was a huge part of that – but the way Rodgers oversaw the development of Jordan Henderson, Jon Flanagan and Raheem Sterling cannot be ignored. All three played a massive part in that fantastic football we all enjoyed last season.

Rodgers also did something that no other manager had done before – he trusted Daniel Sturridge. The striker repaid that faith, and both Liverpool and England benefited.

There were so many examples of good management from Rodgers last season, and they shouldn't be so easily forgotten.

To take a team from seventh position to second is some achievement. The fact that a slip at the end cost Liverpool the title had the effect of making too many people judge the season as a failure.

Far from it. Rodgers' management was magnificent last season and this campaign is proving trickier.

Four defeats in 10 Premier League games and a stuttering Champions League effort isn't good, and I'll be massively impressed if Rodgers can get a consistent run of performances from Mario Balotelli.

And it would be no surprise if Liverpool are well beaten by Real Madrid on Tuesday night.

For the side that finished seventh in the Premier League two years ago to even be on the same pitch as the European champions is some achievement, and the Liverpool manager deserves huge credit.

He's got enough in the bank to be above the kind of scrutiny he's being subjected to right now.

The start of the season hasn't been what Liverpool expected and wanted – you don't need to have played the game to work that one out.

But after what he did last season - and just 10 games into this - I think we should still be focusing more on Rodgers' achievements, rather than what has gone wrong this season.
