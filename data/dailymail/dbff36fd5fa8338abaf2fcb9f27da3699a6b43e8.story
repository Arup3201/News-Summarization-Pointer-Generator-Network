Jailed: Adrian James used a digger to bury the shipping container in his back garden where he grew cannabis

A secret tunnel from a man's cellar led to a shipping container buried underground containing a cannabis factory. 

Adrian James, 43, used a mechanical digger to bury the container in the back garden of his home in St Ann's, Nottingham.

The father-of-two then dug a tunnel from his cellar which led to the huge metal shipping trailer and hid the secret entrance with a board covered in tools.

The tunnel was 16ft long and covered by 3ft of soil.

His drug-cultivating operation included automatic watering systems so he could grow the haul with little effort.

James was arrested in October 2011 after police raided his home looking for drugs following a tip-off.

At first they only found cannabis plants in one room.

But once they uncovered the secret tunnel, they soon discovered the huge container where the cannabis plants were growing. A standard shipping container measures 20ft by 8ft.

Inside were hydroponics equipment with timer switches and an automatic watering system for the plantation.

In total £86,000-worth of cannabis was seized from the house and container.

Appearing at Nottingham Crown Court last Tuesday, James pleaded guilty to production of cannabis at a commercial level and was sentenced to three years in prison.

PC Steve Fenyn, who led the investigation, said: 'When we arrived at the house it was quite a surprise to discover this sophisticated set-up, with a concealed tunnel dug through from his house into the metal shipping container in the garden.

'It would have taken significant time and efforts to dig up the garden, put the freight container in and cover it up, then dig a tunnel into the house.

'The automatic set-up inside the container also required very little maintenance from James. 

'There is no doubt cannabis production would have continued here, had it not been discovered.'

A spokeswoman for Nottinghamshire Police confirmed a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act is going through the courts to seize money and assets that James is likely to have acquired through the criminal activity.
