Using a first-class stamp to send a letter is a waste of time most of the time, a postal economist has warned.

They are extremely useful for last-minute birthday cards, but most people should not ‘bother’ using them with other mail because so few letters are time sensitive nowadays.

Ian Senior, an independent expert, also said Royal Mail’s crucial ‘universal service obligation’ will not survive for another five years.

At present, the postal giant must deliver letters to Britain’s 29 million addresses six days a week for the same price whether it is going to the Scottish highlands or the Cornish coast.

A first class stamp, which costs 62p, means it must be delivered on the next working day. A second class stamp, which costs 53p, must arrive within three working days.

Royal Mail is legally obliged to achieve this target for first class post 93 per cent of the time, although this rule is scrapped at Christmas time every year due to the huge increase in post.

Mr Senior added: For your birthday cards, that [a first class stamp] is fine. But, for everything else, don’t bother.

‘Anybody who buys a first-class stamp in a book of stamps is doing it for birthday cards they have to send and for no other reason.’

When Royal Mail boss Moya Greene was asked recently about the last letter she had posted, she said it was a 17th birthday card to her niece who lives in Canada.

There is very little mail left that is so time sensitive that it must arrive overnight because email and other forms of electronic communication have usurped the need for speed, he said.

Mr Senior said: ‘Who cares if your letters comes one day later or two days later?

‘It really does not matter in virtually every case.’

He said the claim of ‘the cheque is in the post’ is ‘long out of the window’, with most people simply transferring money online, rather than posting a cheque.

Many businesses do not bother with overnight postal deliveries either. The banking giant Lloyds, for example, uses a service which takes between three and five working days.

Asked yesterday on Radio 4’s Today programme if the universal service is on its way out, he said: ‘Most certainly’.

Mr Senior said the idea of delivering letters to every single address in the country six times a week ‘within five years’ will be seen as absurd, although the universal service is heavily protected by law.

He added: ‘The big revolution is that letters as we know them are falling through the floor.’

In 2006, Royal Mail was handling around 80million letters and parcels every day, compared to just 58million a day today.

At Royal Mail’s first annual general meeting yesterday [thurs] since its privatisation last October, one shareholder asked why it bothers with two different classes of stamps.

Donald Brydon, the chairman, said: ‘It gives our customers choice and I believe putting our customers first is the best way to run a business.’

A Royal Mail spokesman added: ‘Ofcom’s most recent review of postal users’ needs identified that one of the core user requirements is a range of services that enables customers to choose the most appropriate product or service for their needs.

‘Customers have the right to choice, and the evidence shows they welcome this aspect of the universal service provided by Royal Mail.’

Shareholders were also concerned the pay gap between postmen and directors, a continued pledge not to make political donations and wanted reassurance about its commitment to stamp collectors.

Of the army of around 500,000 shareholders in Royal Mail, the company said 156 attended yesterday’s AGM held at the vast NEC in Birmingham.

Last night, Royal Mail’s shares, which were priced at £3.30 each when the company floated on the stock market, closed at £4.47.
