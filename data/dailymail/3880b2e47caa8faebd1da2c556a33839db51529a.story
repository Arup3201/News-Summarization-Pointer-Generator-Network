A 9-month-old baby boy seemingly strangled himself on unbuckled car seat straps while his mother was taking a nap, authorities in central California say.

A 33-year-old mother put her son in the car seat in her room inside a Fresno apartment on Monday.

Police tell The Fresno Bee that she put the straps over his shoulders - though she failed to buckle them in.

Scene: The boy apparently strangled himself in a Fresno apartment while his mother was taking a nap 

Lt. Joe Gomez told KFSN 'The baby was in a car seat. The top part was strapped, but there's a bottom part that goes between the child's legs, that was not strapped.

'So while the mother was sleeping, the baby inched its way down trying to get out, and it looks like the baby strangled itself by doing that.'

Later, the mother's boyfriend came home to find the boy blue and not breathing, The Fresno Bee reported.

The baby was pronounced dead at Community Regional Medical Center, according to the newspaper. 

Police are continuing to investigate the incident.

Neither the mother nor her boyfriend has been arrested, police say.
