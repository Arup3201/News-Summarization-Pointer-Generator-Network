A long-lost cat that disappeared more than a decade ago surprised its owner when it turned up sitting outside her house last week.

Molly vanished from her remote home in Gulberwick in the Shetland isles, which has a population of around 800, in 2003.

Despite it being 11 years since she went missing - owner Lynne Peart, 39, instantly recognised the 16-year-old cat because of her distinctive markings.

Mrs Peart said that wherever Molly has been she has certainly been alright for food

Molly's owner has no idea where she has spent the last 11 years but are glad to have her back

She said: 'I thought I was going mad. But I was so sure it was Molly.

'I called out her name and she turned around immediately, and then she started yowling.

Mrs
 Peart and 41-year-old husband John both thought they had seen Molly a 
couple of weeks before she came home, but had convinced themselves it 
wasn’t.

'We thought there was no way it could be Molly. But how wrong we were. 'I still can't quite believe it.'

But
 the mother of two, who works in social care, said the cat’s distinct 
markings leave the couple in no doubt about its identity.

She
 said: 'It's definitely our Molly. There's absolutely no doubt it's her.
 I really couldn't begin to tell you where she's been all these years.

Mrs Peart got Molly when she was a tiny kitten back in 1998

Lynne Peart said she couldn't believe the cat came back after more than a decade

'I think she's been living feral as her fur was very thick and matted when she came back. But she's fat enough. She's looked after herself in her years away. The vet actually said she looks younger than her 16 years.'

Mrs Peart, who first got Molly in 1998 when she was just a kitten, said: 'We got her as a baby with her brother Oscar. She was always the more feral cat.

'She would go out and stay away for a few days, but then come back. So when she went missing at first we thought she would just come back when she was ready.

Molly is back living in Gulberwick, a remote village with a population of around 800

'But eventually we thought she must have died or be living wild and we just put her out of our minds.

'Oscar was missing her so we got another kitten, and we've had several different cats over the years.'

Molly is now settled in with the family and is learning to get on with fellow cat Sally - but Mrs Peart said she can't be sure how long the wandering cat will stay.

A vet said the wandering cat looked younger than her 16 years

She said: 'I like to think that she's come back to spend her twilight years with us. But she's very independent and everything's on her terms.

'I sometimes look at her and think I just can't believe she's actually home. I don't think we'll ever fully know what she's been up to the past ten years or so.

'But she's still very much our Molly and we hope she'll stay around for a while at least.'
