For those of us who are tired, stressed or even downright exhausted, they offer a much-needed pick-me-up in an increasingly fast-paced world.

But it turns out that just one cup of coffee picked up from a high street chain could contain ten times as much caffeine as a can of Coca-Cola.

A snapshot survey of some of the most popular coffee shops and sandwich chains revealed that a large americano from Costa Coffee contains 370mg of caffeine.

Choosing to add an extra shot of espresso would take the figure to above 400mg in a single cup.

This is compared with the 32mg in a can of Coke, a drink already perceived as being high in caffeine.

It is almost twice the daily caffeine limit recommended for pregnant women in the UK – and close to some countries’ threshold for healthy adults.

Other coffees with high levels of caffeine include a large americano from Starbucks, which contains 300mg of the stimulant and a medium americano from Costa Coffee, which contains 277mg.

But the survey found that choosing the cheaper option and enjoying a hot drink at home could also help people cut down their caffeine intake.

A mug of instant coffee made at home contained an estimated 100mg of caffeine, while a cup of tea only had around 75mg.

Health authorities in the UK have not issued official guidelines on how much caffeine an adult should consume in a day.

However they have released advice about how much caffeine a pregnant women should expose their baby to.

Thanks to fears about birth defects, miscarriages and premature deliveries, they advise women to take in no more than 200mg a day during pregnancy.

And in Canada, officials have suggested that adults should normally limit themselves to 400mg – meaning that just one cup of coffee from a high street chain could contain an adult’s total recommended daily allowance.

Dr Alan Crozier, from Glasgow University, said: ‘This is clearly a problem. People at risk could unwittingly ingest far more caffeine than they would dream of.’

A spokesman for Costa Coffee said: ‘Customers are able to request a reduction in their coffee strength or order any of our drinks as a decaf option.’
