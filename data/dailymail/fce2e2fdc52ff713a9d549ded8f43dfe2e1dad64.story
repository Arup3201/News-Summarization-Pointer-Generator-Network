Those hoping that the Scottish Premiership might masquerade as something other than a one-horse race well into the New Year seem set to be disappointed.

This victory for the champions, while by no means perfunctory, was the kind you normally associate with sides that are well in the groove. Few would anticipate the wheels coming off the bogie any time soon.

Not for the first time this season, Ronny Deila’s side made rather a meal of getting the job done but win they did. Again.

Virgil van Dijk’s messy goal on the hour mark was enough to take the points although Celtic were again thankful for the diligence of Craig Gordon in denying Thistle sub Kris Doolan’s spectacular late effort.

Since losing to Hamilton on home soil in early October, Deila’s men have now racked up eight straight domestic victories to keep themselves alive on every front. If they are able to extend that happy sequence over the Festive period, the countdown to the clinching of a fourth successive title will begin.

Van Dijk’s third goal in two games may have been the defining moment but the contribution of Aleksander Tonev was equally as eye-catching.

Later today, the Bulgarian’s appeal over a seven-game ban for using racist language against Aberdeen defender Shay Logan will be heard at Hampden and frankly, up until this point, you had to wonder how much Celtic would miss him if that failed.

This was different, though. Energised, direct and focused, the on-loan Aston Villa player looked anything other than a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders. One who looks capable of belatedly doing something at Celtic – if he’s given the opportunity.

It was the home side who got down to the business of working a goalkeeper first with Paul Gallacher denying John Guidetti a 12th goal in as many starts with a finger-tip save after the Swede had risen to head Stefan Johansen’s cross goalward.

Hopeful that an early goal might see Thistle collapse like a pack of cards, van Dijk fizzed a 25-yarder on target but Gallacher proved up to the challenge.

Fresh from a convincing Scottish Cup win over Hamilton, the Maryhill men were not without their moments and Stephen O’Donnell will doubtless feel he should have done better with a shot from inside the box.

As the clock registered 30 minutes, Thistle found the width of the crossbar separating them from a slender lead. Stuart Bannigan’s in-swinging free-kick was claimed by the formidable figure of Abdul Osman and Gordon looked mighty relieved as the Englishman’s header clipped the woodwork on its way over.

Chances for Celtic remained plentiful. Johansen forced Gallacher into another smart block after latching onto Van Dijk’s superb ball over the top, before the Dutchman fired into the ground and over from Tonev’s centre.

Adam Matthews lashed a meaty volley two yards wide but if there was forgiveness for the Welshman from the home support on that occasion, Anthony Stokes felt their wrath with two poor misses in the closing moments of the first half.

The first one was glaring. Guidetti was beaten to a loose ball by the advanced Gallacher only for Scott Brown to pick up the scraps and recycle the ball to Stokes. Even though two Partick players had regrouped on the line, the Irishman’s inability to hit the target from 15 yards was unforgiveable.

Before the groans had subsided, Stokes played a perfect one-two with Tonev yet, having done the hard part, then overran the ball.

But just when Celtic - by this time with Nir Bitton on for the stricken Charlie Mulgrew – were beginning to test the patience of their fans, they struck.

Brown won a foul on the right which the dependable Johansen dropped in between the Thistle central defenders.

The unfortunate Aaron Muirhead, the deepest of the visitors, was unable to adjust his footing and the ball squirmed to Van Dijk who dispatched it high beyond Gallacher.

Doolan was immediately sprung from the Thistle bench and worried Gordon with a cute angled header that went narrowly wide.

Kris Commons and Stefan Scepovic joined the fray and both missed early opportunities to put the game to bed.

Picked out by Stokes’ cut-back, Commons became the latest man to find Gallacher in fine form. Scepovic didn’t work the Thistle man but ought to have when pouncing on a loose ball eight yards from goal.

As news of Rangers’ remarkable collapse at Alloa reverberated around the stadium, Celtic momentarily lost their way.

Doolan’s remarkable scissor-kick forced Gordon into the save of the match and with it the points remained in the East End.
