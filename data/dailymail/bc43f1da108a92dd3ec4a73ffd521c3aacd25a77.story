Two bad decisions and with them Arsenal lost the Emirates Cup. For one, they could whinge at Martin Atkinson, the referee who in an apparent moment of pre-season complacency denied them a clear penalty. 

For the other, they can only look at themselves for reasons why a £53million striker was left unmarked at a set-piece.

Radamel Falcao rarely needs help in front of goal, but considering his first-half header was his first goal since his knee injury in January the Monaco striker probably won’t mind.

Goal: Falcao 

The goal gave Valencia the branded trinket, their 3-1 win over Benfica earlier in the day making the difference, along with Atkinson’s highly questionable call in the second half of Arsenal’s match.

Chuba Akpom had raced clear with 10 minutes still to play when Monaco keeper Danijel Subasic raced off his line and clattered him. Akpom was possibly offside when he made his run, but was certainly inside the area when the foul occurred. Atkinson gave a yellow card and a free-kick after advice from his assistant; strange calls even for summer football.

Not that it matters, especially. This, like all pre-season matches, was about learning. In that context, Arsene Wenger offered what looked like a significant clue concerning the line-up of his side for the Community Shield against Manchester City, with left back Kieran Gibbs perhaps the only player to come in.

Arsenal handed a start to £10m signing Mathieu Debuchy at right back, indicating again that Calum Chambers is being groomed for a role at centre-half. The pair of them, £22m worth of recruitments, were solid, particularly the latter.

That's your lot: Sanchez went off in the second half

Chambers impressed with his tackling and positioning, even if he did balloon one of Arsenal’s best early chances over the bar from a Santi Cazorla corner. He certainly has the composure to play in the middle. Debuchy, meanwhile, has evidently developed an understanding with Alexis Sanchez, getting forward often to support and feed the attacker in whom so much is expected.

If there is a flaw in Debuchy’s make-up then perhaps it comes in his willingness to run back after those excursions into the opposition half. Wenger likes his full-backs to advance, but what goes up must come down. 

Debuchy’s failure to follow such orders led directly to Lucas Ocampos being free to shoot after 25 minutes.

For Sanchez, there were no such concerns, the Chilean a ball of energy and movement. His passing is occasionally fantastic; his work rate frantic. 

At various stages he rotated through Arsenal’s attacking positions and was probably their most dangerous player in each, certainly in the middle. After 10 minutes, his 40-yard cross-field pass was half a yard away from putting Olivier Giroud clean through.

That chance was cut out by a lunge from Andrea Raggi, the captain of a side that probably deserved to lead at half-time.

The manner in which Monaco went ahead was a little strange to those who might a £53m talent to be marked at a set-piece. Alas, Falcao was left unattended when Joao Moutinho swung over a free-kick – conceded a little needlessly by Jack Wilshere - and the striker headed past Wojciech Szczesny.

Arsenal nearly levelled after the restart when Cazorla’s little flick put Wilshere through, but Subasic pulled off an excellent reflex save. And Sanchez fired just wide shortly after the hour.

Akpom then had his shout ignored for a penalty and Monaco gave Valencia the cup.
