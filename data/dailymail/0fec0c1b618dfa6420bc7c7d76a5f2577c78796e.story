Blistering heat continues to scorch the Northeast with temperatures soaring high into the 90s as forecasters warn the inferno will continue into the weekend, only to be replaced by a lashing from damaging summer storms.

Top temperatures will also be paired with intense humidity, pushing heat indices past 100 degrees, the National Weather Service said.

And as residents across the East face sauna-like conditions, more Northerly states from the Dakotas into northerly New England will see fierce thunderstorms Wednesday.

All this while wildfires in California and the Southwest and Colorado face disastrous flood potential into Wednesday.

Officials said the 54-inch water main

to replace it, promising a sweltering few days for residents.

'Residents
who live in the affected area are being encouraged to stock up on water
in preparation for loss of service during repair of the pipe,' 
officials said in a news release. 'Mandatory water conservation for 
people in the affected areas will likely be imposed tomorrow afternoon.'

But
it's not only the East that is sweltering in the heat as Medford, 
Oregon endured temperatures of 99 on Monday and residents of Boise, 
Idaho suffered through 101 degrees.

These temperatures are as much as 10 degrees above the average for this time of year.

The
fire is on Forest Service Land and, though it is starting to be 
contained, weather conditions don't suggest rain in the rugged, arid 
area and the flames remain on a course approaching more densely 
populated Palm Springs, California.

Further east in Colorado and New Mexico, residents are bracing for the opposite problem.

The Four Corners region is expecting massive downpours thanks to an influx of moist air from the Gulf.

Brutal winds and flooding could accompany these storms, which are expected to last through Thursday.

Flooding is expected to be particularly bad in areas already damaged by wildfires as burn scars leave rain water with nowhere to go.

To the north in the northern Midwest and east in to northern New England, fierce storms are predicted as well.

On Wednesday, according to Accuweather.com, the region should expect localized damaging winds and dangerous lightning strikes.

Forecasters predict that Providence, New York City, 
Philadelphia and Washington will see temperatures averaging in the 
mid-90s and could see the heat index values in the low 100s.

The
searing heat will be accompanied by largely stagnant, windless 
conditions, leaving Northeasterners without so much as an occasional 
cool breeze to take their minds off the heat.

For New York City and southern 
New England, this qualifies as a heat wave, which is three
or more days with highs in the 90s. The heatwave is expected to stretch into seven days.

According to CBS News, a
heat advisory is announced when the heat and humidity combine to make 
it feel like at least 95 degrees out for two days on end or, 
alternatively, if the heat index reaches 100 to 104. Be advised, this weekâ€™s heat wave will offer both.

'It's
going to be very hot and humid this week,' said New York Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg.

'The weather can be dangerous, especially for those without 
air conditioning, the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. 
There are about 425 cooling centers that we have open around the city 
for those needing relief from the heat.'

This overwhelming heat wave is expected to last until Sunday, when temperatures will drop to an average of the mid-80s.

Residents can't expect a complete reprieve, however.

With the incoming cooler temperatures will come the potential for extreme storms and accompanying damage in the East.

On Friday and Saturday, the Northeast is predicted to bear the brunt of some serious thunderstorms, bringing with them high, gusting winds and the potential for flash flooding.

Already stricken from a serious heat wave, the Northeast corridor is expected to finally see the weather calm down and cool off by Sunday.

Heat wave: Temperatures across the Eastern Corridor are set to stay in the 90s until Sunday, allowing no let up from the weekend's heat. Pictured, children play in Battery Park, New York this weekend

In the mean time, people
living in the heat wave areas should be careful to drink enough water 
and should avoid strenuous activity in the middle of the day. They 
should also wear hats and sunscreen.

But
it won't be just be the Northeast sweating through the week as parts of
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley - including Chicago, Detroit and 
Cincinnati - are seeing temperatures in the low 90s.

Temperatures this month in the Northeast are several degrees above average due to a hot start to the month.

In southern New England, the average 
temperature so far this month is five to six degrees above average in 
Boston, Hartford and Providence, the Weather Channel reported.
