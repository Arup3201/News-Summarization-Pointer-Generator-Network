Theresa May has been accused by a senior official of delaying reports into immigration that are critical of the Government

Theresa May has been accused by a senior official of delaying reports into immigration that are critical of the Government.

The head of Britain’s immigration watchdog, John Vine, accused the Home Secretary of failing to publish his inspections for up to five months after completion.

In a letter to a committee of MPs, Mr Vine, the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, said Mrs May’s decision to control the timing meant ‘the independence of my role is compromised’.

Mr Vine, who is standing down early from his role next month, wrote to the Commons Public Accounts Committee that he had worked with home secretaries since 2009 and had published dozens of reports independently of government.

He said Mrs May wrote to him in December 2013 saying he would subsequently have to publish his reports through her department because of a legal requirement.

Mr Vine said he took advice from Treasury lawyers, who questioned the Home Office’s interpretation of the law.

‘I feared at the time that a consequence of her decision might be that reports would not be published promptly, reducing the impact of their findings. My concerns have proven correct’, he wrote, in a letter seen by The Guardian.

‘The majority of my reports since January 2014 have been subject to significant delays between submission to the Home Secretary and being laid in Parliament.’

He said delaying the reports ‘risks reducing the effectiveness of independent inspection’ and told MPs ‘it is contributing to a sense that the independence of my role is being compromised’.

Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, described the delays as unacceptable.

One of Mr Vine’s reports not yet released involves Operation Nexus, a plan to deport more than 100 foreign offenders each week, which was submitted in June.

A Home Office spokesman denied reports were sat on. He said: ‘Reports are laid as soon as they are ready for publication. However, some reports require significant consideration and this can cause delays.’
