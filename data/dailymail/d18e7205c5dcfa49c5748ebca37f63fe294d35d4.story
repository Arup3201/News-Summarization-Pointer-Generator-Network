The rocketing rise of budget German supermarket Lidl continues, with price-busting groceries the least of it.

Not content with luring bargain- conscious middle-class shoppers away from the bigger supermarkets with cut-price lobster, champagne and posh deli hams, they’ve also entered the worlds of fashion and beauty.

Three years ago, their £4 perfume Suddenly Madame Glamour outshone Chanel’s £61 Coco Mademoiselle in a trial. Then last year, beauty experts raved over the brand’s £1.99 BB cream.

Until now the supermarket has limited itself to basic underwear and vests. But today the brand’s Esmara range — boasting jeans, shirts, knitwear and a stand-out ‘leather’ jacket for £15 — arrives in all 600 stores nationwide.

Described as ‘more current and on-trend, as much about quality as affordability,’ Lidl say it is ‘a natural progression for us’.

Natural for Lidl, maybe, but for its shoppers? As a 50-year-old woman keen on a bargain, I decided to find out . . .

GREAT SKIRT, SHAME ABOUT THE JUMPER 

Denim skirt £5.99, sweater £5.99

In general, Lidl’s tops are better than anything the chain has come up with for the bottom half.

But this jumper is not so much roomy as shapeless, exacerbated by the unflattering slash neckline. While there is nothing wrong with clothing that IS cheap, it mustn’t LOOK cheap.

However, the denim skirt is pleasingly faded. The fit is good, and while too short for me to wear bare-legged, I’d happily team it with a polo neck, tights and boots for autumn/winter.

SOPHISTICATED CHIFFON FOR ONLY £5.99

Skirt £5.99, chiffon blouse £5.99

At first glance, this outfit looks promising: the £5.99 skirt has a trendy abstract print and the silky shirt looks like it costs far more than £5.99.

When on, it’s a different story. The skirt looks as if it would lose all shape in the seat with just a few wears.

But the shirt has possibilities. Lidl describes it as chiffon, but it’s very definitely synthetic, not silk. Yet it hangs well and feels quite pleasant. The tiny buttons are fiddly, but at this incredible price, how picky can you be?

HATE THE JEANS, LOVE THE SHIRT 

Maroon jeans £6.99, denim shirt £5.99

These jeans are available in grey, blue wash, navy or maroon and presumably are all as horrid as each other. The shape could not flatter anyone, and they quickly become slack in all the wrong places. Not a patch on Primark’s excellent range of jeans.

But the soft denim shirt is a real find. I expected the fabric to gather in bulging folds, and I was wrong. Once on, it becomes apparent how well-tailored the fitted shape is, with no unsightly gaping at the cleavage.

BRILLIANT £14.99 BIKER 

Jacket £14.99, jeans £6.99, blouse £5.99

Without any doubt, the absolute star of Lidl’s range is this biker-style jacket that costs an astonishing £14.99.

No, you would never mistake it for leather, but not many will spot that it is 100 per cent viscose. Yes, I’ll be running out to buy it today. But the jeans? The £6.99 price tag doesn’t look such a bargain once they’re on. They achieve the trick previously unique to Ann Widdecombe’s clothes — both too big and too small at the same time.

THE VERDICT 

Try to pair almost any piece from the range with another and you run into a problem — head-to-toe Lidl is not a great look. But we have long learned to mix and match budget fashion gems such as the biker jacket. And the white chiffon blouse, denim skirt and denim shirt are all useful staples at an extraordinary price.
