A businessman underwent a five-hour operation to rebuild his skull after he was glassed by a thug at a pub.

Simon Morris, 31, suffered such appalling injuries that surgeons had to peel back part of his face to insert four titanium plates.

Mr Morris, from Hagley, Worcestershire, had to have more than 60 stapes to his face and is now permanently scarred following the vicious attack in a pub in Birmingham.

Separate micro-stitches had to be used on his shattered eye socket.

Police are hunting the thug who threw the glass in The Victoria pub on John Bright
Street, Birmingham, at 11.30pm on August 3 and have released CCTV footage.

The advertising and marketing firm boss said: 'I just went out for a drink - and have been through all of this.

'The physical injuries have been bad enough, but there’s also been the psychological damage and pressure that it has put on relationships.

'I have found it very difficult to accept the changes to my face.'

Mr Morris was drinking with work colleagues at The Victoria when he was hit by the glass, which had been thrown across the room.

The married businessman, who runs Bareface Media in the Custard Factory, initially thought he had been punched.

He had, in fact, been hit with a full pint glass, thrown by a drinker who was fighting with others in a row over two women.

Mr Morris was in the pub with workmates and foreigners on work experience placements.

He said: 'We offer placements for young people and had some over from Germany. We wanted to show them what Birmingham was like - unfortunately they did not leave with the best impression.

'In fact, I was talking to another guy from Manchester. I was telling him how good Birmingham was when it felt like I had been punched on the side of my face.

'I was caught completely unaware. I didn’t know what had happened.

'I fell to the floor and the people involved in the scuffle nearby all ran off. I was told later that the glass was thrown by a guy who had been arguing in the two groups about two women.

'I think it was aimed at somebody else, but it obviously missed.'

Mr Morris was rushed to A&E at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and an X-ray later revealed the full extent of his horror injuries.

As well as the four fractures, he had suffered damage to his sinuses, which had filled with blood, and his eye socket.

He was also suffering excruciating pain from a collapsed nerve that was also affecting his teeth.

'The surgeons told me that the glass must have been full,' Simon recalled. 'They said a punch, or an empty glass would not have caused the same level of damage.

'I was on morphine to combat the pain and was hallucinating about seeing white elephants in the room with me.

'After going through the trauma of the operation and all the pain, I was told that I could lose the sight in my eye because of internal bleeding. It was like being hit for a second time.

'Just a few days after this happened my wife’s grandad died yet I was unable to support her, which was upsetting and frustrating. She has really been put through the mill.

'It was also my birthday a couple of days later and the surprise party that had been arranged obviously had to be cancelled.'

He has made a remarkable recovery, but is now only able to work in short bursts.

He struggles with headaches and finds it difficult to concentrate in sunlight or under bright lights.

The businessman also suffers from double vision and numbness in the face, which he has been warned could be permanent. He also finds crowded places difficult to deal with.

'It’s frustrating and it has been a real rollercoaster, but I am trying to get back to reality,' he said.

'My family, friends, the police and the hospital staff have all been brilliant and it has been reassuring that there are some nice people out there.

'It is a bit strange when you turn up for a business meeting and you are wearing a cap to cover the huge scars, but you have to get on with things.'

And Simon added about the man responsible: 'What I would say to the person who did this, or the people who know him, is to take a look inside yourself and think about what you have done.

'People like this make a split second decision to do something like this, but do not have to live with the ramifications.

'People should not be allowed to carry on behaving in this way.'

Detective Constable Andy Atkinson, from West Midlands Police, said: 'This was a completely innocent bystander who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It could have happened to anyone.

'He was simply drinking and chatting with friends, when a glass was thrown into the crowd.

'He’s had to go through a terrible ordeal and the person responsible needs to be aware of the damage they’ve done and be held accountable for their actions.'
