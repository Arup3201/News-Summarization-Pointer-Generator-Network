The art of high-low dressing — mixing cheap High Street basics with pricey designer togs — is an ongoing obsession in fashion, especially with the Duchess of Cambridge’s penchant for combining cheap with chic. But how low can you actually go?

Can a 99p dress really look classy when it’s teamed with designer accessories? And won’t a pair of £5 shoes always ruin the impact of an expensive frock? To find out we’ve hidden one bargain-basement item in each of these glamorous ensembles.

So, by looking at the pictures, can you tell the steal from the splurge?

A classic way to look like you’re dressed up to the 
nines is to pick just one colour from a pattern and lightly coordinate, 
rather than going for one shade top to toe, which can seem a little too 
obvious to be truly chic.

In this case, a very classy LK Bennett dress 
in an exploded multicoloured tweed print — looking every penny of its 
£295 — has eight hues from which to choose, and pulling out the red with
 a stylish thin Reiss belt (£55) and a pair of ankle-strap suede heels, 
together with a gold bracelet (£65) to tie in with the belt buckle, 
looks together but relaxed. Oh, and those heels? They’re a fiver.

If you’re choosing where to economise, it makes sense 
to go for the pieces that require less intricate tailoring — which makes
 this stretch dress from Boohoo.com, at just £8, the perfect choice to 
wear under a beautifully constructed £405 jacket from Paule Ka, a 
Parisian designer favoured by the Duchess of Cambridge.

The modern 
blessing of Lycra means there will be no problem with fit, and the midi 
length, high neck and subtle, warm colour save it from looking tacky. A 
pair of good, grown-up Lucy Choi stilettos — an investment at £195 — in 
the same shade, imply that this is an important enough dress to warrant 
serious accessories.

Could this be the cheapest dress in Britain? A simple
 black cotton-jersey maxi is the right choice to enhance that 
astonishing £245 emerald-and-diamond-look statement necklace, because 
frankly no one is going to care about the rest of your outfit when 
you’re working that amount of bling.

And while this 99p (yes, 99p) 
number appears low-key, the ruched bodice and the gathering just beneath
 the bust are surprisingly flattering. As the dress is so simple, the 
£185 gold shoes and £95 clutch are more exposed, however, so the extra 
cost pays off — especially as they, too, distract the eye from too-close
 scrutiny of this bargain-basement frock.

There’s casual and there’s casual: it’s hard to make even 
the most expensive jersey-cotton T-shirt look smart, but buy it in a 
crisp woven cotton and team it with these flattering £175 designer jeans
 and an investment bag — this £250 tote from Reiss could easily pass for
 a piece with an extra zero on the end — and suddenly you have a daytime
 look that radiates chic.

It pays to choose your colours carefully, too —
 this £8 George top from Asda is in a nice, classic navy with a 
pared-back floral pattern which tones nicely with the rest of the look, 
and the addition of a pair of nude-coloured high-heeled sandals shows 
you’re putting in the effort.Floral top, £8, Asda.com/George; Bodycon jeans, £175, Mih-jeans.com; Sandals, £39.99, Zara.com, Bag, £250, Reiss.com

It’s often said that an expensive bag is the best way 
to elevate an outfit, but in this case the cheap clutch is lifted by the
 rest of the look.

As far as the onlooker is concerned, there’s no way 
you would contaminate this divinely pretty £89 top and £130 skirt, from 
Alice Temperley’s Somerset line — cinched in with a good belt and worn 
with smart Russel & Bromley heels (£165) — with a £7.50 bag.

In 
fact, though, clutches are the best bags to economise on: they don’t 
need to be as hardwearing as a handbag, cheaper fabrics look just as 
good as leather, and at such a small size it is much harder to 
distinguish a BHS from a Bottega Veneta.

A navy blazer is a great fashion leveller, 
instantly lending a grown-up, classic edge to anything from jeans to a 
high-octane pencil skirt.

When that skirt costs £10 from Primark, the 
blazer’s cachet certainly helps. Here, with its sexy curves neutralised 
by the straight cut of the £80 jacket and the high-necked top from Reiss
 — at £95 it’s the most expensive piece here — it looks perfectly 
appropriate and, with its scalloped hem, is surprisingly well-finished 
for the price.

Part of the trick in pulling off an up-market look is 
getting the balance of fabrics right — here the lace in the skirt mixes 
beautifully with the heavier blazer and the super-luxe satin 
turtle-neck.

Is it realistic to try to mix and match designer and High Street fashion?
