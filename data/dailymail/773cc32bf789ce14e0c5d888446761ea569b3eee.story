A married physical education teacher from Tennessee has been arrested and charged with repeatedly having sex with a 14-year-old student.

Shelley Lott Brown, 32, from Mt Juliet, turned herself in to police Tuesday on two counts of statutory rape by an authority figure.

Brown worked as a gym teacher at Goodlettsville Middle School for grades five through eight.

According to a criminal complaint, Mrs Brown had sex with the teenage boy at least on two occasions during the summer of 2014, reported The Tennessean. 

Brown, a mother of two, was taken into custody after an anonymous caller tipped off the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services in October about her alleged tryst with the student.

The PE teacher allegedly met the victim through her class and their relationship turned physical in the summer between the boy’s middle school and high school years.

A five-month investigation into the allegations against Brown culminated with her surrender Tuesday.

According to a cached bio on Goodlettsville Middle School's website, Brown, a graduate of Davidson Academy, has been at the school for more than eight years.

The entry states that in her free time, Brown 'enjoys going to church, hanging out with friends, watching silly reality shows, and spending time' with her husband, two children and three poodles.

Mrs Brown was placed on administrative leave and suspended without pay in December.

She is being held in jail on $75,000 bond.
