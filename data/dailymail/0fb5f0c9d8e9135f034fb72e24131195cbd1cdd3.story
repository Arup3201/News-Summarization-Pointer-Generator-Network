Meet one of the youngest drivers in the world in her truly scrumptious car.

Indiya Tasker, three, drives round her grandparent's garden in a mini-replica of the enchanted Chitty Chitty Bang Bang vehicle which can reach speeds of ten miles per hour.

It was built by her grandfather Nick Pointing who built a similar one for his wife, Carolyn, based on the famous vehicle driven by Dick Van Dyke in the 1968 film.

He spent hundreds of hours creating the vehicle which is complete with fold-out wings.

She said: 'It's phantasmagorical. I think the film is great and I’ve seen it loads of times. I love driving this car.'

'Indiya loves the film and thinks we have the real movie car in our garage!' said Nick, 48, who has also a built a full-size replica.

'So I decided the best birthday present we could give her would be a scaled-down version, that she could safely drive herself. Originally I thought of a simple pedal car, but as you can see, I got more ambitious.'

The mini-Chitty took two years to build, at the Pointings' home on the Isle of Wight.

Nick 
concentrated on the engineering while Carolyn, 48, made the red leather 
chesterfield seats and varnished the wooden boat tail.

The car from the 1968 film which starred Dick Van Dyke, Sally Ann Howes and the children Adrian Hall and Heather Ripley

'The car 
is 11 feet long and built on a ride-on lawnmower chassis, with wings 
fitted where the cutting blades used to be,' said Nick.

'The boat-shaped rear is made from hardwood boat-building timber, with the bonnet cut from sheet aluminium,' he said.

The gleaming, vintage brass front headlamps cost just £20 at a local auto jumble. Other parts were adapted from anything the couple could find.

'The front and rear fenders are built from a lounge bench seat, with the rear lights made from the inner workings of old Land Rover brakes,' said Nick.

'Brass and red leather came from an 
auto jumble and other parts were adapted from anything I could find as 
in the spirit of the film,' he said.

'The
front and rear fenders are from an old lounge bench seat, the rear 
lights from brakes off an old Land Rover and the bonnet belt is from a 
local supermarket.'

'Chitty is powered by a ten horse-power engine, comfortable cruising at about 10 miles per hour.'Carolyn, a police officer, said Indiya is carefully supervised when she gets behind the wheel.

'She rode on Nick’s lap for the first few drives around our garden.

'But she’s now quite happy to let the handbrake off and drive around on her own, although we’re always very close by!' she said.

To complete the authentic look of the vehicle, the horn is made from a brass speedometer cable topped with an intricate snake’s head, which Nick, a manager at Marks & Spencer, carved from ash wood, adding two teddy bear eyes.

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was written by James Bond author Ian Fleming and published in 1964. The film was released four years later and was an immediate hit.

The story revolves around eccentric inventor Caractacus Potts, played by Dick Van Dyke, who builds the amazing car.

Sally
Ann Howes played Truly Scrumptious, who befriends Caractacus as they 
fly, in Chitty,  to rescue trapped children in the land of Vulgaria.

OK, let's go: 'The film is great,' says Indiya. 'I love driving this car'
