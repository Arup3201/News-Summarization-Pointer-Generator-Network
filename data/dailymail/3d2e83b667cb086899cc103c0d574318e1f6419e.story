His 1983 election manifesto was described as the ‘longest suicide note in history’.

And behind the scenes, civil servants were worried that Labour leader Michael Foot’s nuclear disarmament policy could also be fatal for Britain’s relationship with the US if he came to power.

Files reveal that Foot’s plan to fight the 1983 general election on an anti-nuclear platform would have caused problems with Britain’s allies, according to the National Archives files.

Worried about the outcome of the election, Cabinet Secretary Sir Robert Armstrong drew up a list of issues that would have to be tackled by an incoming Labour prime minister.

He said: ‘The most pressing are in the nuclear field where manifesto commitments to halt cruise missile deployment, cancel the Trident programme and include the British Polaris force in the current nuclear disarmament negotiations impinge directly on the interests of the United States and of Britain’s other Nato allies.

‘You will wish to look for early advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Defence Secretary on how best to handle these issues so as to avoid or minimise damage to the cohesion of Nato.’

In the end, Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives won the 1983 general election by a landslide

The Ministry of Defence also felt compelled to give advice on the proposal that Labour would order US military forces out of Britain.

One official wrote: ‘The jettisoning of an alliance commitment by a major European ally could give added impetus to the isolationist movement in the US and begin a process of decoupling US forces from the defence of Europe,’ one official wrote.

In the event, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives won the election by a landslide.
