Miss Thomas had died after 'serious failings' by paramedics, and heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections

Two paramedics have been struck off after they told a dying woman to stay at home because she only had a ‘tummy bug’.

Hours later Sarah Thomas, 30, was dead because her symptoms were not taken seriously by the pair of ‘incompetent’ ambulance workers who refused to take her to hospital.

Paramedic David Glover told her she just had stomach bug even though she was barely conscious and struggling to breathe.

Miss Thomas would have survived if she was taken to hospital and given a simple injection, an inquest has already been told.

Now a disciplinary hearing has heard that Glover and his colleague Michael Davies then tried to cover up their mistake by fabricating her clinical record.

The pair were banned from working as paramedics by a disciplinary panel of the Health and Care Professions Council.

Panel chair Ian Crookall said: ‘The public would be appalled at the lack of competence.

‘The facts of the case would undermine public confidence in the profession in the eyes of any member of the public who was aware of the circumstances.’

He went on: ‘When there is a case of proven dishonesty it is necessary to uphold regulatory standards by demonstrating that such behaviour is not acceptable.’

Miss Thomas was visited at her home in Port Talbot, South Wales, by the two paramedics following a 999 call.

But a Health and Care Professions Council hearing was told how Glover failed check her vital signs including pulse, breathing and blood oxygenation.

The dental nurse had diabetes and her pituitary gland had been removed after surgery for a brain tumour.

An inquest earlier this year found that Miss Thomas had died after ‘serious failings’ by paramedics, and heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections.

But the hearing in Cardiff was told that Glover failed to ask suitable questions about her medical history before her death in May 2007.

He told her: ‘You just have a stomach bug. You are better off here Sarah, this is the best place for you.’ But the patient died just six hours later of adrenal insufficiency - when her body stopped producing the necessary steroid hormones.

Glover and Davies, who were working for the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, then ‘colluded to fabricate a patient record’ the hearing was told.

The pair added information they got later from another paramedic in an attempt to cover up their failures.

Mr Crookall added: ‘The panel was of the view that the established failure to conduct a proper assessment.

‘The subsequent dishonest fabrication and collusion are very serious, representing a disregard for fundamental and core duties.

‘It had the potential of causing very significant degree of harm - including death.’ The inquest in February this year heard Miss Thomas was battling the after-effects of a brain tumour when an ambulance was called.

Coroner Philip Rogers said then: ‘There were serious failings in the way in which the crew went about their assessment and recording her condition that night.’ He added: ‘If Sarah had been taken to hospital it was likely she would have received intravenous hydrocortisone injections and fluids, and her death would not have occurred.

‘But given the crew’s lack of knowledge and the rarity of Sarah’s condition, this cannot be labelled as gross failings.’
