When pulled over by police on Sunday, a 21-year-old Western Australian driver admitted to drinking 'non-stop' on a road trip from Perth to Albany.

Officers pulled over the Mitsubishi four-wheel-drive after a motorist reported seeing it swerving across the Albany Highway.

Josh Court's explanation to police for blowing more than three-times the legal limit was that he and two friends were seeing how much alcohol they were able to consume during the almost five-hour drive.

'It's a young, stupid mentality': Josh Thomas, 21, was pulled over by police on Sunday and admitted to drinking 'non-stop' during a road trip from Perth to Albany, on Australia's west coast

Police claim Mr Court, originally from Dunsborough in Western Australia's Margaret River, was visibly intoxicated and beer could be smelt in the car.

He allegedly told police he consumed seven beers during the drive - about one every 30 minutes.

Sergeant Al Keogh, of the Mt Barker district police, expressed his dismay with the three men in the car, for displaying such reckless abandon during a state-wide long weekend - when thousands of extra cars were using Albany Highway.

'It's a young, stupid mentality. All three of them in the car were tanked,' Sgt Keogh told The West Australian newspaper.

'His explanation was he and his two friends in the car were going to see how much they could drink in the time it took to drive from Perth to Albany, with little or no regard to other motorists or members of the public.'

Roughly one beer every half hour: Mr Court blew more than three times over the legal limit during what should have been about a 4.5-hour drive

'It's absolutely pathetic,' Sgt Keogh noted.

'You have a long weekend where there are thousands of extra cars on the road and you have this bunch of idiots thinking they'll get pissed as they drive at 110km/h.'

Sgt Keogh was pleased the car was stopped before somebody was potentially killed.

'We do not tolerate this behaviour,' he added.

Police served Mr Court with an immediate two-month driving ban and charged him with a drink driving-related offence.

Concerned motorist alerted police: Officers were able to pull Mr Court's Mitsubishi four-wheel-drive over on the Albany Highway, as he was about to enter Mt Barker - a bit over half an hour away from their final destination

One of Mr Court's friends offered to drive the remaining 50km from Mt Barker to Albany, but was also too far over the legal limit to drive.

Police remained at the scene to ensure none of the drunk young men got behind the wheel.

'People who drink at this level of intoxication need to experience the full weight of the law and these people have no right on our roads until they can show some responsibility,' Road Safety Council chairman Murray Lampard said.

If convicted of driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.15 or more, Mr Court potentially faces a 10-month driving ban and a $2,500 fine, if this is his first offense.

Mr Court is due to front Albany Magistrate's Court on June 26.
