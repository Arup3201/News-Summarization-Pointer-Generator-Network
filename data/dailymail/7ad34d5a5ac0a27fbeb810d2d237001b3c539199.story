According to Chile boss Jorge Sampaoli, if Chile’s match against Brazil had been on Friday there was no chance Gary Medel would have played.

'If the game were today he would not play. It is a real concern,' said Sampaoli on Friday.

'Because of his character there is always hope, as he usually recovers quicker than other players. He suffered a muscle strain yesterday and we will see how it evolves.'

No holding back: Medel is consoled after they lose the match

The midfielder-turned-defender somehow recovered to start against the hosts on Saturday and run 10km during 109 minutes at Estadio Mineirao.

With heavy strapping on his left leg, Medel – playing out of position against one of the best attackers in the world – ran himself into the ground, throwing himself at shot after shot and putting in tackle after tackle on the likes of Neymar, Oscar and Hulk.

At the end of 90 minutes he collapsed on to his back inside the centre circle.

While Sampaoli encouraged the rest of the team, Medel was receiving treatment on his left leg in order for him to carry on into extra-time.

Only when 
he could no longer walk in the 109th did Medel accept that his part in 
the game was up. He left the field on a stretcher, biting back tears.

When 
Gonzalo Jara fired Chile’s fifth spot-kick against the post, Medel was 
inconsolable. Again he sunk to the turf in Estadio Mineirao.

This time he could not fight back the tears.

He was 
consoled by Chile’s substitute goalkeeper Johnny Herrera, before a group
 of his team-mates surrounded him and helped him up in order to applaud 
their travelling fans.
