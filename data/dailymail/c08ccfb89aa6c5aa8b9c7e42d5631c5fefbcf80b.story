High street chain Argos has been accused of racism after selling black and Asian dolls for £10 less than the white version of the children's toy.

The store has been branded 'unacceptable' for pricing a white doll, called 'Maria', at £34.99 - £10 more than black doll 'Naima' and Asian doll 'Yang'.

Mother-of-three Lisa O'Reilly, from South Killingholme, Lincolnshire, complained to the retailer after noticing the pricing difference while shopping for her two-year-old daughter Darcy.

The 12-inch dolls, designed for children aged 18 months and above, are made my French firm Corolle Calin.

They are described on the maker's site as having 'cuddly soft beanbag bodies, sleeping eyes and supple vinyl skin that is delicately scented with vanilla'.

Mrs O'Reilly, 32, condemned the pricing difference by Argos and said there's 'enough prejudice in the world already without battling against racist toys'.

She told The Sun's Emer Martin, Rob Pattinson and Sam Christie: 'It's unacceptable for children to think white is better or more desirable.

'It's wrong for our youngsters to grow up thinking non-white skin colours are worth less.'

According to the newspaper, Argos has since sent an apology email to Ms O'Reilly which said: 'I am sorry to read that you are offended by the price difference between the Maria, Yang and Naima Corolle Calin Dolls and I can assure you that Argos would never intentionally upset or offend our customers in any way.'

A spokesman for the store told MailOnline today that the mix-up was a 'genuine online pricing error'.

In a statement, he said: 'As a responsible retailer, Argos strongly refutes any suggestion of discrimination with the pricing of the Corolle Calin dolls.

'A genuine online pricing error led to one of the dolls being advertised at an incorrect price. 

'This error is being amended today and all three dolls are now priced at £24.99. 

'We apologise for any confusion caused.'

However, as of 9am today the prices still varied on the retailer's website.

The Corolle Calin dolls could be found at varying prices on Argos' website, prompting an official complaint

It is not the first time children's toys have been at the centre of a racism row.

In 2013, Lego was accused of racism by the Turkish community over a Star Wars toy allegedly depicting a mosque.

The critics claimed that the Jabba's Palace model, part of Lego's Star Wars range, was offensive to Muslims because it resembled the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul - one of the world's most renowned mosques.

Members of the Turkish Cultural Community of Austria group also accused the toy manufacturer of depicting Asians as having 'deceitful and criminal personalities'.

At the time, outraged Muslims criticised the toy producer, accusing it of deliberately placing contextual errors in the toy.

Lego responded by confirming that the Lego set was based on the home of Jabba the Hutt, a central character in the Star Wars series, who lives in a domed palace, with a separated watchtower.

It was said that the Jabba's Palace model, part of Lego's Star Wars range, was offensivebecause it resembled the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul (pictured) - which is one of the world's most renowned mosques

At the time, a spokesman said: ‘The Lego Star Wars product Jabba´s Palace does not reflect any actually existing buildings, people, or the mentioned mosque.

'The Lego mini-figures are all modelled on characters from the movie.

'We regret that the product has caused the members of the Turkish cultural community to come to a wrong interpretation, but point out that when designing the product only the fictional content of the Star Wars saga were referred to.'

And in 2010, The Early Learning Centre ditched the pig from its HappyLand Goosefeather Farm toy set after it upset some customers. 

At the time, the store said the farm animal was removed from the set following ‘customer feedback’ and ‘religious reasons’. In some religions, pigs are seen as unclean.

In 2010, The Early Learning Centre removed the pig from its HappyLand Goosefeather Farm toy set over fears it would upset customers because of 'religious reasons'. It later did a U-turn and put the farm animal back in

However, just days later, the retailer did a U-turn and agreed to bring back the pigs after disappointed families complained.

Writing on an online fourm, one mother said: ‘I’m a Muslim and it doesn’t bother me. It is just another animal. What is the store going to do next? Ban the Peppa Pig cartoon? Ban books with pigs in?’

The Early Learning Centre later released a statement which said: ‘We have taken the decision to reinstate the pigs and will no longer sell the set in international markets where it might be an issue.’
