A crippling condition means Lauren Harry dislocates her shoulders every time she sneezes.A cough, or the slightest jolt - even driving over a speed bump - can knock them out of their sockets.

Lauren, 20, says her shoulders can dislocate ten times a day. She's been to A&E four times in the last week alone.

Doctors believe she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a genetic condition which means her collagen is too weak to hold her limbs in place.

Lauren, from Wrexham, north Wales, first experienced pains in her legs at the age of 11, but was told it was due to growing pains.

But at the age of 15 she fell off her crutches while attending the Eisteddfod in Conwy, injuring her shoulder in the process.

Since then her shoulders and other joints, including her knees and fingers, have regularly dislocated.

Lauren, who moved to Brymbo from Connah's Quay last year, was unable to complete her AS levels because of her condition.

She has been given stabilising surgery on her shoulders on five separate occasions at Wrightington Hospital, Lancashire, but the problems persist.

The slightest jolt can knock Lauren's joints out of their sockets, as seen in this shoulder X-ray

Lauren, who works at a McDonald's drive thru in Chester, said: 'My shoulders dislocate around 10 times a day on each shoulder even if I cough, sneeze or go over a speed bump.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that affect the connective tissues.

Most types of the genetic condition affect the production of collagen, which gives tissue strength and allows it to stretch.

Collagen is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels, the gut andÂ the spine.

It means joints are loose and unstable and prone to dislocating. Swelling, sprains and hyperextension are also common.

Skin is soft and fragile and bruises easily. This leads to slow and poor wound healing.

There is no known cure for EDS. Treatment may help to manage symptoms, such as surgery to repair muscle damage and medication for pain.

Sufferers can wear joint braces, do physical therapy to strengthen joints, avoid very physical activities and wear sunscreen to reduce the risk of harm.

'The other day in work I opened the fire door and dislocated all of my fingers and I've dislocated them pushing myself up off the sofa before.

'I can't even play fight with my little sister without something dislocating.

'Because I work in Chester I'm back and to from A&E at Wrexham Maelor Hospital and the Countess of Chester all the time,' she said.

'I went into A&E last week and they relocated my shoulder but dislocated my elbow and that's never happened before. It's so easily done.

'I've had a few operations which have fixed it for a while, but not for longer than nine months with no dislocation.'

Lauren has yet to be tested for 
Ehlers-Danlos, but is currently seeking funding for specialist treatment
at The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in Stanmore.

She said: 'The more times I go to the doctors they all say it sounds like Ehlers-Danlos.

'Usually you have to stay on a waiting list for a year for blood tests, but if I go to Stanmore I can get tested straight away.

'I know they teach you coping 
techniques to relocate your joints more effectively and also try and 
help with the psychological side.'

Despite her condition Lauren says she tries to make sure it doesn't prevent her from leading a normal life.

She said: 'In work I always go in regardless of how much pain I'm in.

'People can't get a day off work because of me. They just say 'well look what Lauren has to go through'.

'They're really good with me in McDonald's, they'll get me a chair if I need to sit down.

'I can only really work on the 'drive thru' taking orders and payments because I'm anaphylactic and allergic to nuts and sesame seeds.'

Lauren is supported by her mum Kath Sneade, 41, who she lives with along with her step-dad, Colin, 56, two younger sisters Jessica, 18 and Rhiannon, nine, and brother Joshua, eight.

Mrs Sneade said: 'Lauren tries to live as independently as she can, but she does get really down sometimes.

'She can't go anywhere or do anything unless someone goes with her.'
