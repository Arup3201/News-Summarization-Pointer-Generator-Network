Derek Warwick, the British steward who cleared Nico Rosberg of cheating at the Monaco Grand Prix, has urged Lewis Hamilton to ‘man up’ over the decision and move on.

Hamilton was angry that Rosberg slithered off the track at the Mirabeau corner in the dying minutes of qualifying. It caused yellow flags to be waved, preventing Hamilton from finishing his final lap and leaving Rosberg in pole position.

Rosberg went on to win the race, with Hamilton insinuating afterwards that data he saw showed his Mercedes team-mate had acted deliberately.

But Warwick, who is president of the British Racing Drivers’ Club, Silverstone’s owners, and a veteran of 146 Formula One races, said: ‘I understand that Lewis was upset. Possibly he would have gone faster than Nico on that lap. Arguably the incident cost him the Grand Prix.

‘I don’t want to give him advice really — he has won umpteen races and a world championship — but if I were to say anything it would be to man up and concentrate on the next race in Canada.’

Speaking about the stewards’ decision for the first time, Warwick told Sportsmail: ‘You could argue that as president of the BRDC I would have a reason to come to a decision that would have favoured the British driver, but obviously that is not how I would approach it. I am there to be independent.

‘It is a big decision to make when you are deciding to move a driver to the back of the grid. It was doubly important to get it right because it could affect many things — probably the outcome of the race and possibly of the world championship.

‘We had all Mercedes’s data, including Lewis’s data to overlay on Nico’s. We had the FIA data. We had onboard shots, overhead shots, circuit shots. We had throttle traces, braking traces, everything we needed to make, hopefully, the right decision.

‘It was not black and white. It took a long time. We wanted to be sure and thorough.

‘The driver is a massive component in what we end up deciding. So Nico was in the stewards’ room for a long time with the team manager (Ron Meadows). I wouldn’t say I interrogated him; I interviewed him. I made sure I asked him all the right questions.

‘I have been around a long time and seen people try to pull the wool over my eyes. Did I I have doubts in my mind, of course I did. But he gave me the answers I needed.

‘I know there are conspiracy  theories but you will not find a more honest driver in grand prix racing than Nico. He said himself that he made a mistake, came in too fast, braked too late and locked up his rear tyres.’

The FIA brought in former drivers as stewards — of whom Warwick is one of the most respected for his sense of fairness — to help the panel make informed decisions.

There was unanimity among the four stewards in this case.
