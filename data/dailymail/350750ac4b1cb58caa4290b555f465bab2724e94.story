A message in a bottle has been pulled from the sea by fishermen a record-breaking 101 years after it was sent.

A German called Richard Platz scribbled his note to the world on May 17, 1913 – one year before the First World War, in which he died.

It was a postcard from Denmark with two German stamps on it and a message asking the finder ‘to post it on to my address in Berlin’.

More than a century on, it was found by a crew from the north German port of Heikendorf, near Kiel. ‘When I saw the date I got really excited,’ said skipper Konrad Fischer.

The oldest message in a bottle listed by Guinness World Records was found in 2012 – 97 years after it was sent.

Unusual haul: The bottle has become the longest so far to stay adrift before being picked up

Find: The old beer bottle contained a postcard dated 17 May 1913. Mr Fischer the fisherman was amazed
