Arsenal secured three crucial points in the Barclays Premier League with a 1-0 win over West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.

Arsene Wenger will be glad to relieve the pressure mounting on him with the win, courtesy of a Santi Cazorla inch-perfect cross and a thumping header by Danny Welbeck.

Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill rates each player after the first Premier League match of the day. 

WEST BROM

Ben Foster - 5.5

Saw the good and bad of Foster. Did fantastic to deny Welbeck in the first half, but wasn't convincing at times. Had a scare while needlessly trying to skin Giroud. Got away with a couple of mistakes.

Andre Wisdom - 5

Tangle with Welbeck in the box saw Arsenal  appeal for a penalty. Did well at times in sticky situations, but Wisdom lost Cazorla during his decisive game-winning run.

Joleon Lescott - 6

Coped well when asked to at the back and was solid. Arsenal pressure eventually paid off. Lescott occasionally tried to help with set pieces up front, too.

The good and bad of Ben Foster came out on Saturday as the West Brom goalkeeper had his ups and downs

Craig Dawson - 6

Tasked with marking Giroud for the majority and did okay at the back with Lescott as his partner. Put a shift in. Largely helped West Brom remain in the tie until Welbeck's goal on the hour.

Sebastien Pocognoli - 6

Tried to help in attack down the left and work rate was impressive. Well and truly beaten in the air by Welbeck for his goal, though.

Craig Gardner - 5

A few misplaced passes here and there. Arsenal kept possession well in the middle. Had the one and only shot on target for Albion - and his tame effort drew ironic cheers from the home crowd.

Youssuf Mulumbu - 4.5

Needless dangerous play on the edge of his box while surrounded by Arsenal players, which almost led to the opening goal. Could have given away a penalty against Sanchez, too.  

Chris Brunt - 5

Regularly found space down the left side but could not do a whole lot with it. Passing in opposition half left a lot to be desired. Gunners dominated the midfield.

Graham Dorrans - 5

An average performance from Dorrans. Saw a lot of the ball but needs to show more strength to cope in midfield.

Stephane Sessegnon - 6.5

Looked a menace at times while in a rare attack for West Brom, but to little avail. End product missing. Unlucky to be substituted with Albion chasing the equaliser - crowd boos  justified.

Saido Berahino - 7

Kept quiet to begin with. Desperately unlucky to be flagged offside for a one-on-one chance, when he was in fact on. His powerful header that struck the crossbar almost brought about the equaliser. 

West Brom's Saido Berahino provided Albion's main goal threat against Arsenal at the Hawthorns

SUBSTITUTES

Victor Anichebe (on for Mulumbu 65') - 5

Strong and powerful as Albion searched for a late goal. Couldn't find a shot.

Cristian Gamboa (on for Pocognoli 75') - 5.5 

Georgios Samaras (on for Sessegnon 76') - 5 

ARSENAL 

Damian Martinez - 6

Untested throughout the entire first half. Made one save in his first Premier League start for Arsenal. Clean sheet but helped by the crossbar. Simple enough.

Calum Chambers - 6.5

Saw plenty of the ball and held the fort well in defence. Made more clearances than the rest of Arsenal's back four combined. Got himself forward, too.

Per Mertesacker - 7

Rock at the back. Won almost every header in his vicinity. Had a chance to score in the second half after a fumble by Foster but dragged his shot wide with plenty of bodies in the way.

Per Mertesacker was a rock at the back for Arsenal as they kept a clean sheet against West Brom

Laurent Koscielny - 7

Greatly missed. Excellent in defence on his return and made a big difference for Wenger. He and Mertesacker looked an ideal partnership.

Nacho Monreal - 4

Injured while trying to beat a man in defence for no apparent reason. Unwise decision. Substituted after 23 minutes as a result. 

Mathieu Flamini - 6.5

A workhorse as per and well disciplined. Not the biggest impact but his passing was flawless.

Laurent Koscielny has been greatly missed by Arsenal and looked excellent at the back for the Gunners

Aaron Ramsey - 5.5

Got himself about well with a nifty trick here and there. Still looks a shadow of himself from last season, though. Four shots off target and selfish at times.

Danny Welbeck - 8

Started on the right but moved central. Could have given Arsenal the lead in the first half with a brilliantly-timed run. Did not fluff his lines with his thumping header in the second half.

Alexis Sanchez - 6

Fair few chances in the first half, though the majority were tame. Forever busy closing down the Albion defence. Managed just one shot on target however.

Santi Cazorla - 9

Made the goal that won Arsenal the match with a superb run down the left and inch-perfect cross. Had his fair share of chances from distance in the first half, but blocks and Foster denied him. 

Olivier Giroud - 6.5

Decent enough first start. Stuck to his role well, allowing those around to play off him in the centre. Worked hard and unlucky to miss target from a tight angle after dispossessing  goalkeeper Foster.

Santi Cazorla (left) proved the main man for Arsenal on Saturday and was instrumental in the victory

SUBSTITUTES

Kieran Gibbs (on for Monreal 23') - 6.5

Wasn't expecting to be asked to contribute so early but joined the game well and tracked Pocognoli and Brunt on the left. Pace to burn.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (on for Giroud '78) - 6
