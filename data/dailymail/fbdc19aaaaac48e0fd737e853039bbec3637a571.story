Enough is enough. The suffering has to stop. Sam Warburton and his Wales team-mates will square up to their southern tormentors this month hell-bent on improving the record that haunts them.

For all the achievements during Warren Gatland's tenure – two Grand Slams, a third championship title last year and coming so close to a place in the last World Cup Final – the roll-call of failure against the leading nations from the far side of the equator has become a cause for grave concern. 

Year after year after frustrating year, the SANZAR nations come to Cardiff, storm the barricades and make off with the silver.

The results column is brutal. In these blue riband matches, under the current regime, Wales have played 25, won one, lost 24. 

That sole victory, against Australia in 2008, has been followed by nine consecutive defeats – eight of which have come by a single-figure margin. It has been a sporting death by a thousand tiny cuts.

No wonder Warburton, as captain, is weary of the annual routine; the agony of optimism being expressed and then swiftly crushed. 

As he prepares to lead his country into their latest tussle with the Wallaby escape-artists, the Cardiff Blues flanker urgently craves an end to the waiting for a watershed win. 'I'm tired of talking about it,' he said. 'It's the same every year; the same questions and we always say, 'This is our year, this is our year'.

'People are always asking, 'What do you have to do differently to get the results?'. If I knew that, we would have done it four years ago. 

As long as we keep believing in ourselves and training hard, it definitely will happen one day. I'm very confident that we can get at least one win in those matches against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.'

Unusually for a Welshman, Warburton admits to taking a certain amount of inspiration from the superior November exploits of the bitter rivals from across the Severn Bridge. 

Warburton is relishing the opportunity for Wales to put the record straight in the autumn Test Series

He added: 'You've got to respect England because, every year, they turn someone over in their autumn series and they deserve a lot of credit for that. All the Wales players are aware of how long it has gone on for and it would be a career highlight if we could beat a southern-hemisphere team.

'It would be a massive occasion for every Welsh player and there would be a massive celebration after it, because it's been such a big hurdle for so long. It builds more and more every year, the longer and longer it goes on.'

When attempting to understand the reasons for the Welsh drought against the southern elite, Warburton identifies factors involving the mind and the lungs. In his view, the physical aspect is that the SANZAR teams operate better under extreme fatigue because they are more used to it due to the high-speed intensity of their rugby week after week.

The mental aspect comes down to the simple issue of positive precedent creating belief. That's what England have in their favour. 'England have done it in the past,' said the 26-year-old.

Warburton says England's World Cup success in 2003 was crucial for their long-term future

'That 2003 side gave England a massive boost for probably a decade after, because you know that players who are in that changing-room have gone out for those games and come back in with a win. It has happened.

'That's why it's so important to get over that first hurdle and when you've done it once, it's so much easier psychologically to do it again. It's like a high jumper who has jumped 2.30m before – they are much more likely to approach it differently the next time.

'I think that's the same for England; they play against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and they can refer back to five years ago, six years ago, eight years ago, when they won. Psychologically that does have a massively positive effect on you.'

Setting his stall out for the autumn series at the Millennium Stadium, Warburton naturally insists that the initial objective is to win all four games. 

When he considers the backdrop of persistent Welsh defeat at this time of year, he concedes that a solitary big scalp would suffice to prove that Gatland's team are on an upward curve, but only if it is the start of a trend, not a glorious blip.

'When it does happen for us, I really do think it will start snowballing,' he said. 'But if it does happen for us, we can't get carried away. We can't think, 'Right, we've beaten Australia, we're a top-three side in the world'. Australia have beaten us nine times in a row so if we beat them once, we have to do it again and again and again.

'It's all very well us doing it once, but we have to keep backing it up. No disrespect, but if Dagenham & Redbridge beat Man United tomorrow, it doesn't mean they're good enough to play in the Premier League, they have to do it again and again. That has to be the long-term target for Wales.'

The football references don't end there. Warburton is a keen follower of the game and he takes inspiration from two recent England players when it comes to putting loyalty at the heart of his career plan. 

Warburton says Wales need to beat teams like Australia on a regular basis at the highest level to be labelled a top side in the future

He decided to stay at Cardiff Blues, on a dual contract with the WRU, despite interest from France and he said: 'For me, there would be nothing more satisfying than staying at Cardiff and achieving success with the team I grew up watching.

'I have a lot of respect for someone like Steven Gerrard because he's been a one-club man. I would like to finish my career as a one-club man.

'I just quite like that idea. My football hero is Ledley King – everyone knows I'm a Tottenham fan – and he stayed at Spurs for his whole career. Those sort of guys are role models to me. That's why I have so much admiration for Brian O' Driscoll, because he stayed at Leinster and believed in them.'

So far, the Blues revival has yet to ignite but for now, Warburton's focus has shifted to Test business, starting with the Wallabies on Saturday. 

He recognises that there would be a 'massive psychological boost' to be gained from beating opponents who will join the same onerous, three-way fight for qualification from World Cup, Pool A next year.

Warburton hopes to end his career as a one-club man with Cardiff Blues - just like Steven Gerrard at Liverpool 

There will be a major round-robin casualty. 'The fact is that a big side with the potential to reach a semi-final will go out at the pool stage,' said Warburton.

'It's exciting for the neutrals but from a Welsh, English and Australian perspective, it's a nightmare! The only advantage is that if you can get through that group, you will be battle-hardened going into the quarter-finals.'

Before that time comes, Wales need to add their own extra layer of armour, in the form of at least one significant victory against the southern raiders. This will be a momentous month. Warburton is sick of talking about ending the drought – it's time for results, not rhetoric.
