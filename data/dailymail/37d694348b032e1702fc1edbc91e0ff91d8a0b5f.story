'Sapper' Clive Smith, who lost his legs in an explosion in Afghanistan, has become the face of The Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal

Sprawled on the dusty Afghan battlefield, he was minutes from bleeding to death after he was blown up by an IED.

Hero soldier Clive Smith had suffered the appalling injuries while undertaking one of the most dangerous tasks in the Army - searching for buried bombs at the front of a patrol.

But he missed one planted device which was cunningly made with a low metal content to reduce the chance of detection - costing him both legs.

His life was saved only by the quick action of his comrades who helped stem the catastrophic blood loss before evacuating him from the battlefield.

Now Sapper Smith, 27, is facing two huge challenges: learning to walk again and helping raise millions of pounds for the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal.

Two years after he was nearly killed, Sapper Smith, who served with 33 Engineer Regiment, is the face of the charity's £42million fundraising drive for 2012.

He hopes his story will inspire members of the public to dig deep and beat the record £40million the RBL raised last year.

Sapper Smith, of Cannock, Staffordshire, was fulfilling his dream when he joined the Army shortly after leaving school.

Part of the Counter-IED Task Force, he was the lead man of a search patrol looking for IEDs designed to murder and maim troops and civilians.

Operating in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand, he walked in front of the patrol, sweeping the ground with his Vallon detecting machine in a bid to locate roadside bombs.

It is such a treacherous role because if a lead man misses a device, he is likely to be the one to trigger it. On October 13, 2010, during his second tour of duty, the unthinkable happened.

Using a soldier's notoriously black humour, Sapper Smith said: 'I found one using an unconventional method - I stood on it.

'After the initial contact I was thrown through the air and there was a lot of dust and noise, and it took a while to settle.

'After about 30 seconds I was shouting to the rest of the lads, "Who's hurt?" and they turned round and said, "You are". I didn't realise straight away.'

Remembrance: He is currently using shorter prosthetic legs to train for a full-sized pair woth £30,000

Sapper Smith had lost both legs above the knee. Disregarding their own safety, his colleagues dashed to give him medical treatment - applying tourniquets to his damaged legs to stop the bleeding.

'They saved my life,' he said. 'If they hadn't done what they did, I wouldn't be here.'

The soldier was evacuated from the battlefield, treated at the state-of-the-art British field hospital at Camp Bastion, and flown back to the military wing of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.

Five weeks later, Sapper Smith was beginning the gruelling recovery process that will see him walk again.

He has spent the last two years in and out of Headley Court, the rehabilitation centre in Surrey, where he is treated by leading prosthetic experts and physios to make sure he regains the strength to walk unaided.

Currently, he is using 'stubbies' - short prosthetic limbs that teach soldiers to walk on false legs.

But he is progressing on to his £30,000 C-legs, which are made by the German company Ottobock for above-the-knee amputees. 'It's all about strength and fitness,' he said. 'The stronger you are, the fitter you are.'

Before the explosion: Sapper Smith was on his second tour of duty when he was horrifically injured in the blast

Sapper Smith became involved with the Royal British Legion after attending its £30million Battle Back Centre, which provides sports and adventure activities to help wounded and sick service personnel recover.

Based at Lilleshall in Staffordshire, it offers injured troops a range of activities including rock-climbing, swimming, kayak canoeing and wheelchair basketball to boost their confidence and fitness.

'It was daunting at first,' said Sapper Smith, 'but people in the military love a challenge and to be pushed out of their comfort zone and that's exactly what it did.

'It shows you that just because you're injured, there are still things you can go and do which is a massive bonus. It has given me a positive outlook which has really helped in all parts of my life.'

The soldier said it was a 'great honour' to front the Poppy Appeal campaign. 'If it wasn't for the British public being so generous and funding places like the Battle Back Centre, injured soldiers and their families would find it more difficult to get their lives back on track.'

Forward: The Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal hopes to beat the £40million it raised last year

The Legion has secured the support of pop stars Alesha Dixon and Pixie Lott to launch the 92nd Poppy Appeal.

They will unveil a major campaign for the Armed Forces, their families and veterans: 'Standing shoulder to shoulder with Armed Forces families.'

The Legion offers flexible and wide-ranging support to all generations of the Armed Forces and their families, including emergency grants, debt advice, employment and training support, assistance through tribunals and inquests, as well as care homes and family breaks.
