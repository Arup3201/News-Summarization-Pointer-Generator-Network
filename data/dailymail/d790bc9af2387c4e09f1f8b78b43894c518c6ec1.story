Andrew Ferguson has admitted using threatening and abusive behaviour after posting a series of tweets about his school earlier this summer

A teenager threatened to massacre pupils at his high school in a series of sickening online messages, a court has heard.

Andrew Ferguson took to Twitter threatening to take a blade into St Mungo's High School in Falkirk, Stirlingshire earlier this summer.

He also tweeted that he hoped that the family of the school's deputy headmaster, James Murphy, 'would die in a massacre' and posted derogatory racial remarks about the pastoral head of the school, Ann-Marie Jess, adding that he wanted to assault her.

The town's sheriff court was told that the 17-year-old, who has since left the Roman Catholic school, tweeted the alarming comments on June 5 this year.

Ferguson, of Falkirk, who appeared in court in a grey suit, white shirt and black tie, pleaded guilty to using threatening and abusive behaviour.

He had been due to face trial today. The court heard he had no previous convictions.

Solicitor-advocate Martin Morrow, defending, told the court that his client had now left the 1,350-pupil school.

Sheriff William Gallacher deferred sentence for a social worker's report until October, when the court will also hear the full details of the case.

The sheriff continued Ferguson's bail on condition that he does not enter the school 'unless invited' and makes no attempt to contact Mr Murphy or Ms Jess.

The sheriff said the case caused him 'some concern'.

He said: 'I haven't heard any background yet, but it is obviously a very unpleasant and very serious matter.

'I want to know how someone with no past convictions could behave in this way.'

St Mungo's High School, the only Roman Catholic high school in the Falkirk Council area, moved to a new building on the site of the old school's sports fields five years ago.
