Drunks, customers refusing to pay and offensive language have forced a pizza shop to ban an entire street in northern Queensland from receiving home deliveries.

The decision was made by a Pizza Power outlet in the town of Andergove after residents from Sunita Drive had been consistently abusive towards the young delivery staff.

Once the black ban was put in place, shop manager Lillian Riley said she was verbally abused and hit by an angry customer from the street demanding to know why he had been refused delivery service over the phone.

That case went before Mackay Magistrates Court and the offender was fined.

Pizza Power takeaway shop has refused delivering pizza to residents who live on Sunita drive in Andergove in northern Queensland

Ms Riley, whose son owns the store, told the Daily Mercury that the man, who was ‘yelling and screaming’, pushed the heavy shop counter and attempted to punch her in the head but struck her arm instead.

However, Sunita Drive was not the first street to be struck off the home delivery list with others in the area also banned due to the danger staff had been subjected to in the past.

Staff also dealt with aggressive customers inside the store dubbing Tuesday evenings as ‘fight night’.

Ms Riley’s son was subjected to a particularly vicious attack where two women verbally abused and attacked him for not taking a pizza to them outside.

One woman got him down on the ground then kicked him in the groin more than once and also stomped on him, according to his mother.

‘We have to stand our ground,’ Ms Riley said. ‘We only ask for people to be polite but there are many loyal customers who are terrific, who make it worthwhile.’

She said business had dropped off at the shop because customers were intimidated by the anti -social behaviour of youths wandering around at night.
