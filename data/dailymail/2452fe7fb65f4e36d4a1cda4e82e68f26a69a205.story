The latest triumph for British engineering – Mercedes’ clinching of the Formula One world constructors’ championship – will earn each of the team’s 700 staff a bonus of at least £10,000 each.

Everyone from the cleaners up to the superstar drivers, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, will be rewarded after Mercedes’ blitz to glory at last Sunday’s Russian Grand Prix.

It is the first time Mercedes have won the constructors’ title, and they did it in great style with nine one-two finishes and victories in 13 of the 16 grands prix, just shy of McLaren’s 1988 record.

All of Mercedes' staff will receive a bonus fee believed to be in the region of £10,000

Hamilton is currently top of the drivers' world championship standings ahead of his Mercedes team-mate

1. Mercedes - 565

2. Red Bull - 342

3. Williams - 216

4. Ferrari - 188

5. McLaren - 143

6. Force India - 123

7. Toro Rosso - 29

8. Lotus - 8

9. Marussia - 2

10. Sauber - 0

11. Caterham - 0

Their nearest challengers Red Bull, who also paid their staff £10,000 when they won the championship, are out of contention with three races remaining.

Although the base rate for the Mercedes staff is £10,000, it is understood that figure could be even greater for some of the workforce. Exactly how much more they pocket will be determined at an annual review in the new year. The total prize fund for winning the title is a massive £40million.

Much of the total amount will be ploughed into the budget for future years.

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda addressed the team's employees at their Brackley headquarters on Monday with Hamilton and Rosberg, who are in direct competition for the drivers' prize, expected to visit the factory on Tuesday for a breakfast of champions - a bacon sandwich.

Mercedes’ win is another example of Britain’s engineering hegemony in Formula One. Most of the teams are based in the ‘motorsport valley’ in the Midlands. So the Mercedes bonuses represent a near annual boom time for the area's bathroom, kitchen and carpet fitters.

As well as the design of the winning car being carried out at Brackley, their supreme engine is manufactured at Brixworth under the direction of Englishman Andy Cowell.

The team was put together by Ross Brawn before he left as part of an ugly coup d’etat at the end of last season. The debt they owe Brawn is considerable.

No wonder Wolff paid a fulsome tribute to him. ‘I have to pinch myself sometimes that we are part of the Mercedes history. We won the first constructors' title for Mercedes-Benz, ever,' he said.

‘I feel proud and honoured to be part of the team. The foundations of the team were built by Ross, he played such an important role in the team.

'The steps that were done in 2012, the people that joined in 2012, we're important, and since then we were on an upward slope.’

However, Wolff’s words could be thought slightly hollow. It was he who controversially forced Brawn out, having bought his way into the team. Technical chief Paddy Lowe was also drafted in behind Brawn's back. 

Brawn left Mercedes at the end of the 2013 Formula One season but his influence is still evident

Brawn, who turns 60 next month, is lost to Formula One, and indulging his love of fishing, though he has been invited to the team's Christmas party.

The focus in the final rounds in America, Brazil and Abu Dhabi is now on a straight fight between Hamilton and Rosberg. Just 17 points separate the pair – next to nothing with the points at the last race on November 23 counting double.

Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo, who was seventh in Russia, is 92 points behind Hamilton. So big a gulf is that that his boss Christian Horner has conceded his chances are close to zero. 'Daniel would have to win all three remaining grands prix and the Mercedes drivers not finish,’ said Horner. ‘It is just between Lewis and Nico now.’
