Police have been taught to speak Roma in a bid to control tensions in a community flooded by thousands of Eastern European migrants.

Page Hall in Sheffield has been the scene of violent clashes between rival groups of immigrants and locals for months.

Last month, former Home Secretary David Blunkett called for urgent and tough police action in the borough - part of his constituency - to avoid riots.

Integration: A team of nine police officers in Page Hall, Sheffield, have been deployed to help handle tensions between Roma and Slovak migrants. They are patrolling streets and learning to speak Roma

Now, a nine-strong team of officers has been enrolled in Roma lessons in the first of many integration measures.

In a bespoke five-week language learning camp, the team went through basic phrases, verb conjugations, and key vocabulary.

They also covered cultural references to help them connect with the district's newer residents.

Operating from a new permanent base in the community, they will also be patrolling the streets seven days a week in a bid to engage with the community.

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police
 said: 'The community in Page Hall is made up of diverse residents, some
 of which do not speak English.

'A
 key part of a police team's job is to engage and work with the 
community it serves to discuss any concerns they have and to work with 
them to tackle any issues that arise. 

Page Hall started to see an influx of Roma migrants when Slovakia joined the EU in 2004.

Last year, the council estimated 1,500 eastern European Roma residents live in Sheffield

Around 500-900 live in the small Page Hall area.

That figure has been revised up by hundreds since the Government relaxed immigration rules in January, joining the EU's move to allow all European citizens free movement.

'In order to do this, we must be able to speak to local residents - which can be a challenge when a person cannot speak English.

'To help stregthen our relationship with the Roma community in Page Hall, the dedicated police team there have learned the basics of their language so that issues can be dealt with more quickly and to allow our officers to better engage with residents. 

'The impact this has had has been overwhelming. Simply being able to speak directly with people in a language they understand has allowed us to build trust and relationships between police and those who live and work in in the area.'

Tensions in the district came to a head last month when more than 25 Roma and Slovak residents got into a street fight.

A 17-year-old boy broke his arm in the brawl, watched by dozens of residents lining the streets.

Mr
 Blunkett said at the time: 'We were all very apprehensive about the 
emergence of the long warmer nights, and recognise this was going to be a
 moment of pressure.

'The
 police have devoted sufficient manpower and expertise, but what is 
required is a clear, visible presence in the evening, so there’s no 
doubt in anyone’s mind about the determination to clamp down on any kind
 of unacceptable behaviour. 

Outbursts: Police were called to a street fight in Page Hall involving at least 25 people last month

'It’s
 fine having the numbers but they have to be there at the right time. 
Those who perpetrate unacceptable behaviour need to understand the 
police mean business.

'The cause of the problem is believing they can behave in this fashion.'

Since, Eric 
Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, haspledged to support the community and work with the local police in integration measures.

Residents welcomed the government support.

Gail Sharrod, 45, who has lived in 
Page Hall for six years, said: 'The area has changed over recent years 
and we now have people hanging around on the streets.

'But I think it is turning a corner with the police here all the time now.

Action: David Blunkett (left), MP for Sheffield, said urgent and tough police action is needed to avoid riots in the district, which Eric Pickles (right), Local Communities Secretary, has now pledged to deliver

'There used to be big groups hanging around, and young kids on the streets at all times of the day and night, but it’s not as bad these days. I hope that continues.'

Inspector Chris Lewis, who runs the new policing team, said: 'The police are working in partnership in Page Hall to address underlying issues, deemed necessary to alleviate any problems or difficulties.

'Very few of the issues are police related - crime is actually very low - but everyone working here appreciates we need a joined-up approach to get to the root cause of issues if we are to address and resolve them.

'Everything is about raising standards - improving housing, cleaning up the streets, creating more open space, providing more recreational opportunities - helping people to take pride in the area.'
