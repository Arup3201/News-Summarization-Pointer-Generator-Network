A nursery nurse has been spared jail after watering a 'professional' cannabis farm uncovered at her rural home when her ex reported a burglary.

Josephine Merrick, 59, was arrested at the £420,000 Herefordshire home she shared with Malcolm White in October 2011.

White, 63, dialed 999 to report a robbery but when officers arrived at their isolated home in Whitbourne, they discovered the cannabis factory in the couple's garage.

Police officers were called to the home Josephine Merrick shared with Malcolm White after Mr White dialed 999 to report a burglary at the property. Officers found a 'professional' cannabis factory in the couple's garage

Officers seized around 60 plants, believed to be worth up to £18,000 and capable of producing £60,000-worth of cannabis a year.

Merrick pleaded guilty to producing a controlled substance but said her involvement in cultivating the Class B drug was limited.

Hereford Crown Court heard the nursery nurse only 'watered the plants when asked and trimmed the buds but had nothing to do with their growth.'

On Tuesday the mother-of-three was spared prison after Judge Robert Juckes QC said a custodial sentence would be a 'wholly inappropriate' punishment.

Instead she was ordered to carry out just 15 hours of unpaid work.

Merrick was also sentenced to a 12-month supervision order after she entered a guilty plea at an earlier hearing.

Prosecutor Simon Phillips told the court police discovered the cannabis farm after White called 999 to report a break-in.

Two Birmingham men, Robert Richards, 30, and Darren Randall, 26, were arrested in nearby Leigh Sinton in Herefordshire, hours later.

The pair were jailed in February this year after they were convicted of aggravated burglary.

Nicholas Roberts, defending, said Merrick’s arrest and the ordeal of giving evidence during the burglars’ trial had been a ‘sentence in itself’ for her.

He said: 'She is only here today because she was honest.

'She
was initially treated as being a witness in the burglary case but she 
told police that she did know about the cannabis and was arrested.

'She
gave a frank interview and helped all she could and gave evidence in 
the trial of Randall and Richards. Her life has been on hold.

'Police
installed alarms in her home and told her she wouldn’t even be safe to 
walk to her local Tesco. She has moved addresses.'

Merrick, who shared the £420,000 rural home, pictured, with White admitted producing a controlled substance but said her involvement in cultivating the Class B drug was 'limited'

Speaking at the time, Mr Froggatt said: 'The news of her arrest was a complete shock to the system.

'She has very little do with us now but we never thought she would get into something like this.

'I find it hard to believe. Josie has always been very anti-drugs.'

White, who also admitted growing cannabis at an earlier hearing, is accused of shooting Richards, who had his leg amputated following the botched raid.

He denies wounding with intent and will face trial next month at Worcester Crown Court.

Richards was jailed for 10 and a half years while Randall was sentenced to 13 years and four months earlier this year after the pair were found guilty of aggravated burglar last November.
