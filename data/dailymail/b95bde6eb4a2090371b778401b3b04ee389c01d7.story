British people with homes in France were today warned that the property market is in 'free fall'.

A combination of factors including the election of a tax-and-spend Socialist government means that prices are tumbling.

It means an end to the boom years, when thousands of Britons poured money into rental or retirement investments across the Channel.

Some 200,000 of them currently own houses and flats in France, but Le Parisien newspaper today warns that 'transactions are collapsing' because owners have become too ambitious.

Frederic Monssu, CEO of the Guy Hoquet agency, said: 'Convinced that their housing is the most beautiful and because a neighbour has sold theirs for a good price, the sellers will not lower theirs. The result is that the transaction does not happen.'

Patrick Jolly, of Particulier a Particulier (Owner to Owner), said prices 'have reached such a level that buyers simply can’t keep up'.

And Sebastien de Lafond, of MeilleursAgents (Best Agents) said tighter credit controls combined with higher taxes on capital gains had also having a devastating effect.

France’s highest constitutional authority has just given the green light to a highly contentious tax hike affecting foreign owners of second homes.

The Constitutional Council approved the new measure on August 9, despite claims that it was against European Union law.

The election of French President Francois Hollande and his tax-and-spend government is one of the factors that have contributed to the fall in property prices

The law imposes an extra 'social charge' of 15.5 per cent on the existing capital gains tax related to the sale of second homes, meaning the original levy will rise from 19  to 34.5 per cent.

The same 15.5 per cent 'social charge' will be added to the tax of rental income, raising the rate owners have to pay from 20 to 35.5 per cent.

All of the property professionals predict declining prices which, says Le Parisien, will see the market 'go into free fall'.

Reductions of up to seven per cent have already been reported in the southern Bouches-du-Rhone around Marseilles, with three per cent cuts around Nice.

'Leading indicators suggest there is a 
fair chance that the eurozone economy might contract further in the 
third quarter and hence enter a technical recession.'

Laurent Vimont, of the Century 21 agency said there was unlikely to be a complete 'collapse in prices' but decreases could be as high as 10 per cent in coming months.

It comes as figures revealed today that the embattled eurozone is on the brink of a double-dip recession.

A report showed that the 17-nation economy shrank by 0.2 per cent between April and June.

The UK’s biggest trading partner suffered the decline in output as the debt crisis sweeping the continent escalated, with borrowing costs in struggling countries such as Spain and Italy remaining high.

But the eurozone performance still puts the UK in the shade after figures last month revealed that Britain’s economy shrank by 0.7 per cent in the same period.

This compares poorly with the likes of Germany and France, which saw better-than-expected gross domestic product growth of 0.3 per cent and zero respectively.

ING Bank analyst Martin van Vliet said: 'Leading indicators suggest there is a fair chance that the eurozone economy might contract further in the third quarter and hence enter a technical recession.'

With France's economy was stagnant in the second quarter, worries that Europe's second biggest economy is hovering on the edge of a new recession remain.

The preliminary estimates released today by the state statistics agency Insee mark the third straight quarter without growth.

The figures were in line with Insee's earlier forecast for no growth in domestic product for the quarter.

But they were better than estimates by France's central bank, which had forecast a 0.1 per cent contraction in the second quarter and a continued drop in the third quarter.

Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici expressed hope for growth in the second half of the year despite the lackluster first half.

Speaking on Europe-1 radio, he acknowledged that the economy is 'too weak' but stressed that France is staying stable even as 'most of its partners' are in recession, including Spain, Italy and Britain.

The number of jobs in France and consumer spending both shrank in the second quarter, Insee said. Imports grew more than exports, exacerbating concerns about France's growing trade deficit.

While the lack of economic contraction is a relief for France's government, the lack of growth is a challenge for French President Francois Hollande, marking his first 100 days in office.

The Socialist government is focusing on raising taxes on the rich and big business to try to cut the deficit, but some economists and business owners warn this will stifle growth when the country needs it badly.
