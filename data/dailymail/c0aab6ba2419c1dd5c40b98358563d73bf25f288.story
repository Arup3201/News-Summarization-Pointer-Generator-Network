Former Open champion Ernie Els feared he had seriously injured a spectator with his wayward tee shot on the first hole at Hoylake.

The drive that missed the narrow fairway hit the man, believed to be in his sixties, smack on the jaw and he was taken to hospital on Thursday.

And South African Els, 44, known as the Big Easy, was so affected by the incident that he three-putted from a foot to record a triple-bogey seven on the first, followed by a bogey five at the second and an opening round of 79, seven over par.

Els pushed his one-footer about 18 inches past the hole (pictures 1 and 2, above), but rather than re-address the ball, he leaned over to his left and hooked it back instantly with the ‘wrong’ side of the putter (3). It missed the hole again, obliging him to tap in for a seven (4).

Els said afterwards: ‘It looked pretty bad, with blood everywhere, I hope the gentleman’s better. It was like a bullet coming at him. I talked to him, but he was in a daze. We’ve all hit spectators before at some time, but nothing quite as bad as that. It was difficult to concentrate on the golf after what happened.’

Bubba Watson, Els’ playing partner, said: ‘You could tell Ernie was shaken up by it. I’m pretty sure that was why he struggled.’

The R & A said the spectator, whom they didn’t name, had suffered a minor injury and was expected to be released from hospital after a short time.
