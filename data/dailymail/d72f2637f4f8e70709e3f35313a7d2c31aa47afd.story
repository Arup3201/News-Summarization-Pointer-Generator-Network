It could soon be illegal to ask a woman to stop breastfeeding in public places after mothers have campaigned to make it a civil right.

A group in Seattle has been pushing lawmakers to make it a crime to ask women feeding their babies to cover up or leave the premises.

Breastfeeding in public is already legal in the city - but council member Bruce Harrell said enshrining breastfeeding as a civil right would have a multitude of health benefits for the mother and child along with lowering infant mortality rates.

Mr Harrell said the law would encourage mothers from ethnic minorities  - who have lower rates of breastfeeding their children.

One new mother Leticia Brooks told the council: 'Who wants to feed their baby in a bathroom stall? Would you bring your lunch to a bathroom stall?'

Another mother Melissa Miller told SeattlePI.com how she
was once asked by a shop assistant to feed her baby in a changing room at the store to prevent other customers from being offended. 

Following the council meeting, around a dozen mothers gathered for a 'feed in' at council buildings.

However not all Seattle residents were on board with the idea.

Kate Calhoun told Msnbc: 'I can see where a lot of people would be really uncomfortable in certain situations.'

Laws on breastfeeding varied from state to state. According to Mothering.com last year, in the state of Tennessee, for example, the law protected breastfeeding in public but only of a one-year-old or younger.

In Ohio, however, it had been ruled that breastfeeding discrimination is sexual discrimination.

By comparison, Virginia law states a right to breastfeed on state-owned property only.

Seattle council is expected to come to a decision this Monday, April 9.
