A Texas mother is calling on the hit-and-run driver who fatally mowed down her six-year-old son this week after running a red light to 'grow a conscience and turn himself in for doing this to a little boy.'

Lauren Raidy reportedly watched helplessly Thursday evening as a car sped through the red light and struck and killed her son, John Paul Raidy, before callously honking at her - and then zooming away.

The Grand Prairie mother had reportedly been walking home with her son - and his little sister - after buying candy at a local candy store, when the horrific accident occurred around 7:30pm.

A life cut short: Six-year-old John Paul Raidy was crossing the street Thursday evening when he was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver who had sped through a red light

A mother's horror: Lauren Raidy looked on as driver of the hit-and-run vehicle actually honked following the impact with her son, before speeding away

A mother's sorrow: Lauren Raidy said that even on her worst day, her son, John, could look at her and smile and say ¿I love you,¿ and make everything better

A call for justice: Lauren Raidy has earnestly called upon the vehicle's driver to 'grow a conscience and turn himself in for doing this to a little boy'

Tragic scene: Six-year-old John Paul Raidy was crossing the intersection at North Carrier Parkway and Holiday Hills Drive in Grand Prairie when a car struck him

Innocence interrupted: Lauren Raidy was heading home from buying candy with her son, John, and his baby sister, when the accident occurred

'He kept going, and I saw him fly up 
in the air,' Lauren Reidy told CBSDFW.com of her son. 'And then the car 
stops, then he just took off.'

On the worst day you were having, he 
could look at you and smile and he would look at you and say ‘I love 
you,’ and it would make everything better,' the heartbroken mother added
to the station.

Police are searching for a late-model 
four-door hatchback or a small SUV with wraparound taillights and a rear
axle near the back of the vehicle.

Investigators say the car most likely has some minor front-end damage from the collision.

'This is one of the most horrific 
scenes I have ever seen, as far the dynamics of the crash and the 
circumstances surrounding it,' Grand Prairie police Sgt. Eric Hansen 
told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth.

Violent Collision: The hit-and-run driver hit John Paul Raidy with such force that the little boy's body was carried on the hood of the vehicle for between 100 and 300 yards before hitting the pavement

First aid: The boy was rushed to Arlington Memorial Hospital, where he died from his injuries after being hit with such force that he had landed on the hood of the car

The children's step-grandmother told 
Fox 4 that John was slightly ahead of the rest of the family as the 
three of them crossed the intersection at North Carrier Parkway and 
Holiday Hills Drive near Crosswinds High School.

At that moment, police say a dark 
four-door sedan blew past a red light and slammed into the six-year-old 
in the middle of the crosswalk.

The vehicle briefly came to a stop, but then continued south on Carrier Parkway.

'He honked at us to tell us to get out
of the way. He ran a red light. We were in the crosswalk, we weren’t 
crossing illegally, we had the right of way, and he hit my son,' Lauren 
Raidy reportedly said.

The crash was said to be so powerful 
the slender first-grader landed on the hood of the car and was carried 
between 100 and 300 yards before hitting the pavement.

'He's just gone. I'll never be able to
hold my son again, I'll never be able to tell him that I love him,' 
Lauren Raidy reportedly said.
