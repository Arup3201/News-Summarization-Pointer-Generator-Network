A New Mexico judge rejected pleas for leniency Wednesday and handed down the maximum sentence for a then-12-year-old boy who opened fire in a Roswell middle school gym earlier this year, injuring two students.

State District Judge Freddie Romero ordered the boy, now 13, held in state custody until he is 21.

His decision followed a daylong hearing in which the shooter apologized, the defense argued he was the victim of chronic bullying, and the two students wounded in the shooting detailed their permanent injuries.

In custody: Campbell is will be held in state custody until he is 21 in eight years time

For the most part, 
Nathaniel's family has shied away from talking to the media but his 
uncle Anthony Miranda gave an interview to KRQE, saying his nephew was improving at the hospital.

'It's a miracle that I'm alive right 
now,' said 12-year-old Nathaniel Tavarez, who was shot in the face 
January 14 at Berrendo Middle School. 'My vision is still seriously 
impaired, but there is hope. I have conquered many things the doctors 
said I never would.'

Special
 prosecutor Matt Chandler read a statement from the other victim, 
13-year-old Kendal Sanders, as she stood at the podium with Tavarez.

Sanders
 wrote that she has more than 150 lead pellets in her body and might 
never be able to have children. The pellets cause lead poisoning and 
make her ill and tired.

'I 
have to see those scars every single day for the rest of my life,' she 
wrote. '(He) will be able to live the rest of his life the way he wants,
 even have a family.'

In 
May, the boy pleaded no contest to three counts of aggravated battery 
with a deadly weapon and one count of carrying a firearm on school 
premises.

His lawyers 
had asked that he be placed in treatment for two years and then be 
released if doctors determined he was no longer a danger.

A defense memo said the boy was chronically bullied, is socially and emotionally immature, and regrets what he did.

'I'm very, very sorry,' the boy said to Tavarez and Sanders.

The boy's mother urged the judge to consider what her son had gone through.

'This
 is a child who was tortured and bulled on a daily basis. ... I want you
 to realize that he is a child,' she said. 'I also want you to realize 
he has not stopped praying for Nathaniel and Kendal and (security guard 
Kevin) Hayes.' Hayes received minor injuries.

But
 the teacher who helped Tavarez after he was shot called the incident a 
'very deliberate act of violence' and urged the judge to impose the 
maximum sentence.

Chandler, after the hearing, said neither of the victims were bullies.

'These
 are some sweet, caring, softhearted individuals that were in the wrong 
place at the wrong time, and for an individual, whether they're 12 years
 old or an adult, to take out their frustrations on innocent bystanders 
is wrong any way you look at it,' the special prosecutor said.

Chandler
 noted Nathaniel and Kendal are suffering the consequences of something 
that happened to the boy 'perhaps weeks before this, months before this,
 but they are not the reason for the bullying.'

'It's something that needs to be addressed but certainly by no means by acts of violence,' he said.

Chandler said the families of both victims were pleased with the verdict.

Sanders said she accepted the boy's apology.

'He's a really good kid that made a bad decision,' she said after the sentencing.

Tavarez, however, said he is not ready to forgive 'until God tells me to.'
