A mother was left terrified after she walked into her living room and spotted this monster 'Jurassic' sized dragonfly.

Rowena Wilkinson, 53, dashed indoors when she heard piercing screams coming from her daughter and her friend.

She found an enormous dark green dragonfly - measuring around 8inches long - flying around the room like a 'mini-helicopter'.

Rowena Wilkinson, 53, from Buckinghamshire, was left terrified when she walked into her living room to see this enormous dragonfly

Mrs Wilkinson, from Weston Turville, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said: 'I heard them scream and when I ran in this dragonfly was spiralling round very quickly.

'It sounded like a mini helicopter it was that noisy, it was like a Jurassic monster.

'I didn’t know whether to take a photograph or run but I managed to get close enough to take a few pictures.

'We waited for it to stop a bit and then I had to put my arm through the venetian blinds to open the window so it could get out. '

Mrs Wilkinson’s daughter Molly and her friend Ellie Shelby, both 24, were terrified by the creature last Friday.

The mother-of-three saw the enormous beast flying around the room like a 'mini-helicopter'

But Miss Shelby’s daughter Isla Parkin, three, was fascinated by the dragonfly.

Mother-of-three Mrs Wilkinson, a foley artist for the film industry, added: 'Because Isla is so little she wasn't frightened at all and was going up to the dragonfly, it was quite funny as my daughter and her friend were terrified.

'The whole thing was mental.'

Mrs Wilkinson shut the living room door and waited and the black-grey beast flew off. It has not been seen again since.

Dragonflies, which have existed on Earth for 325million years, have been threatened by widespread insecticide use, water pollution and the draining of wetlands for housing.

But in recent years experts say they are enjoying a resurgence thanks to conservation work and warmer weather. 

Britain's longest dragonfly is the female of the golden-ringed species which reaches around 8inches.

In Great Britain and Ireland there are about 30 species that may be encountered and one that has become extinct.

Fifty years ago there were twice as many ponds in Britain as there are today. The draining of agricultural land, filling in and pollution have all contributed to the disappearance of most countryside ponds. Canals have also suffered from pollution, especially by chemicals used on farmland draining into water.

The loss of suitable fresh water habitats has affected dragonflies enormously and they are becoming increasingly rare. The Norfolk aeshna, Aeshna isosceles, which can be found living only in the Norfolk Broads, is on the list of Britain's endangered species of insects.

However, they have enjoyed a resurgence in numbers in recent years thanks to conservation efforts.

No less than seven species have appeared in Britain and five species in Ireland for the first time since 1990, including the Willow Emerald Damselfly.

In the UK dragonflies reach a length of about 85 mm and a wingspan of about 120 mm. This is the size for the larger 'Hawker' dragonflies such as the Emperor and Brown Hawker. Damselflies, which are the much smaller and weaker flying relatives of dragonflies, are much smaller.

The largest in the UK are the Demoiselles. These have a body length of about 50 mm and a wingspan of about 60mm.

The species in the UK fall under these categories:Calopterygidae - DemoisellesCoenagrionidae - Red and Blue/black damselfliesLestidae - Emerald damselfliesPlatycnemididae - White-legged damselfliesAeshnidae - Hawker DragonfliesCordulegastridae - Golden-ringed DragonfliesCorduliidae - Emerald DragonfliesGomphidae - Club-tailed DragonfliesLibellulidae - Chasers, Skimmers and DartersSources: British Dragonfly Society, Young People's Trust For The Environment
