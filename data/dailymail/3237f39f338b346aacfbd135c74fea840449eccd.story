Arsene Wenger wants a midfielder in the mould of Tiote, but insists he will only go for a top talent in his search of a holding midfielder. 

Tiote, who would cost in the region of £12million, is open to leaving St James' Park in search of a new challenge.

But it is now likely that he will have to wait until the summer.

Manchester United are growing increasingly confident they will land Nathaniel Clyne from Southampton - but not until the end of the season.

Clyne has established a reputation as one of Europe's best emerging right-backs at St Mary's and Louis van Gaal wants to add the England international to his ranks.

A deal is highly unlikely to happen this month, with Ronald Koeman unwilling to sell him at the moment.
