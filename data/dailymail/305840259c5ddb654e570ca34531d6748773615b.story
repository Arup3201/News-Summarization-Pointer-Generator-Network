Rip-off train companies are being ‘totally dishonest’ with passengers on punctuality and must start telling them ‘within just a minute’ when their trains are on time, says Transport Minister Norman Baker.

In a damning broadside against major train operators he said passengers – and taxpayers- have a right to consider trains to be late if they fail to meet a much stricter 60 second deadline.

Set against that tougher ‘just a minute’ punctuality measure up to a third of trains currently deemed ‘on time’ would be late. Watchdogs said passengers felt ‘ripped off.’

The Transport Minister wants trains to be judged late if one minute has passed since it was due, not 10 minutes as it currently is

Mr Baker wants train companies to tighten up their time-keeping. He is demanding an end to the farce which now allows rail companies up to ten minutes leeway on lateness and still have their trains considered officially punctual.

Currently train companies can massage their figures by being allowed to claim officially that their  trains are ‘on time’ if they arrive within five minutes for short-distance and within 10 minutes for long-distance services. This is called the ‘Public Performance measure’ or ‘PPM.’

Allowing just a minute’s leeway is called 'right-time performance.’

But too many train companies are ‘dragging their heels’ in being open with passengers who buy their tickets and taxpayers who subsidise the railways, he said.

The broadside and warning of an impending crackdown was launched by Mr Baker after he addressed a ‘Rail Transparency Conference’ organised by the watchdog Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) on Monday.

If the new scheme was put in place, up to a third of trains currently deemed 'on time' would be late

Mr Baker, who is fed up with the train companies’ sleight of hand told the Daily Mail afterwards: ‘It is totally dishonest to say trains are punctual when for short distance and journeys they can arrive within 4 minutes and 59 seconds and for long-distance they can be within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still count as being officially on time. Taxpayers and passengers deserve better than this.

‘That is why we are putting pressure on the rail industry to publish proper real-time performance  figures.'

Taking his cue from two popular BBC Radio4  comedy series, Mr Baker said: ‘Punctuality should be measured by ‘Just a Minute’, not ‘I’m sorry I haven’t a Clue.’

Latest figures show that under the current system around 9 out of 10 (89.3 per cent) of trains are now officially on time.

But under the stricter ‘right time’ counting, this plummets to around 6 out 10 (62 per cent) – a fall of around a third.

Under the current system for long-distance operators who have ten minutes’ leeway, Virgin West Coast currently measures just over three-quarters (77.5 per cent ) on time, First Great Western (88.2 per cent), and East Coast (87.4 per cent).

But under the stricter measure of trains being late if they are just a minute overdue, the punctuality rate for long-distance trains plummets to just half  (50 per cent) on time. 

Similarly, punctuality performance for London and regional services is artificially enhanced by the current measure – with Chiltern (93 per cent), c2cRail (97.8per cent), First Capital Connect (87.2 per cent),  First ScotRail (88.7 per cent), Greater Anglia (89.3 per cent), Northern Rail (88 per cent),  South West trains (91.8 per cent), Southeastern (88 per cent), Southern (81.1per cent), and Arriva Trains Wales (93 per cent).

But measured under the ‘just a minute’ leeway rules, punctuality for regional services in London and the South East plummets to just 62.7 per cent, and in the rest of the UK (including ScotRail) to 63.4 per cent on time. Currently only broad regional ‘real time’ breakdowns are published.

But next week Network Rail will go 
further and publish ‘real time’ punctuality figures by individual train 
company. These will show wide variation in performance – with some 
companies currently considered to be officially ‘punctual’ ending up 
‘late’ when given only 59 seconds leeway.

The Transport Minister called train companies 'totally dishonest' when they say a train is within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still counts as being officially on time

And early next year Mr Baker says he intends to publish real time figures for individual train service routes, so rail traveller can see how the train they catch performs in ‘real time.’ He said: ‘People want to know punctual the train they use is. Taxpayers also have a tight to know.

‘It is much better if train companies are as open as possible rather than forcing people to make Freedom of Information requests. The irony is that train punctuality is pretty good  and much better than it has been.’

ORR chairman Anna Walker told the Rail Transparency Conference: ‘We believe that greater transparency in the rail industry can deliver great benefits for passengers, taxpayers, business, and the rail industry itself. 

‘Lack of trust breeds suspicion that passengers are being ‘ripped off’ and taxpayers are not getting value from the railways. Customers expect to see more and better information on mobile devices.’

But a spokesman for the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) said: ‘Rail passengers already know far more about how the services they use perform compared to other forms of transport such as road or air travel.

‘We have responded to the government’s wish for further information on performance, despite repeatedly making it clear that the data is not yet reliable.’
