Chelsea are set to be given a major boost heading into their Premier League clash with QPR on Saturday, with Diego Costa and Ramires due to return from injury. 

Costa has been suffering with hamstring problems that have ruled him out of the Blues' last four games but will return for the  west London derby along with midfielder Ramires.

Chelsea have remained unbeaten this season but the news will come as a blessing for Jose Mourinho, with the Blues boss confirming the Spain international's comeback following a Capital One Cup win at Shrewsbury.

Mourinho said: 'Without any further complications, Diego Costa and Ramires will be fit to face QPR at the weekend.' 

Costa has proven one of the signings of the season so far, having scored nine goals in his first nine games for the Stamford Bridge based club.

But Costa wasn't needed at the Greenhous Meadow, where the Premier League leaders survived a late scare before seeing off their League Two opponents 2-1.

Didier Drogba scored his third goal in as many games to give Chelsea a second half lead, with Jermaine Grandison's own goal handing the visitors the winner in the fourth round just moments after Andy Mangan had equalised for Shrewsbury.
