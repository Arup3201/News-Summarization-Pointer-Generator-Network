The ticket wartime Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain used on his historic trip to broker a peace deal with Adolf Hitler has sold for almost £17,000.

Chamberlain waved the ticket as he boarded the British Airways flight from Heston Aerodrome in London to Munich on September 29, 1938.

The aim of the trip was to hold crisis talks following Germany’s invasion of Czechoslovakia and fearing
 war, Chamberlain agreed to allow Hitler’s occupation of part of the 
country in return for the assurance that peace and stability in Europe 
would continue.

It sold to a private collector at London auction house Spink and Son on Friday and is only the second time the ticket has been offered at auction.

'Peace in our time': The ticket Neville Chamberlain used to board a plane to Munich for a meeting with Hitler in 1938 is expected to fetch £15,000 at an auction later this month

Symbolic: The wartime leader waved the Anglo-German declaration on his return from the crisis talks. But just a year later he was forced to announce that Britain was at war following Germany's invasion of Poland

Neill Granger, a specialist at Spink, said: 'This plane ticket is quite exceptional.

'Neville Chamberlain’s visit to Munich in 1938 was an iconic moment in history. He thought he had solved the problem of Hitler and returned triumphant.

'But famously things didn’t turn out the way Chamberlain expected and a year later we were at war with Germany.

'What Chamberlain had intended to be a landmark moment ended up being one of the nails in his political coffin.'

Mr Granger added: 'The flight ticket was issued on September 28, 1938, the day before the flight.

'It was found among the personal possessions of George Denny, one of the founders of British Airways.

'Normally these tickets were thrown away but he obviously decided this one was one to keep.'

Historic: Chamberlain, pictured boarding the plane on September 29 1938,  met with the Fuhrer alongside Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier in a bid to secure peace in Europe

Support: A crowd of supporters and reporters gathered at the Heston Aerodrome to see the Prime Minister off 

Farewell: Chamberlain embarks on the crucial journey to Germany 

Along with Italian fascist leader Benito 
Mussolini and French Prime Minister Edouard Daladier, Chamberlain and 
Hitler signed a pact that became known as the Munich Agreement.

On
 his return to Britain the following day, Chamberlain triumphantly 
declared that war had been averted and he had secured 'peace for our 
time'.

As
 he waved the Anglo-German declaration above his head, he told reporters
 waiting on the runway that the pact was 'symbolic of the desire of our 
two peoples never to go to war with one another again.'

But
 just a year later he was forced to make the embarrassing announcement 
that Britain was at war with Germany following Hitler’s continued 
invasion of Poland.

The
 reaction set the grounds for Chamberlain’s political demise and by May 
1940 he had been replaced by Winston Churchill as Prime Minister.

The paper ticket carried the number BA/WS 18249 and under 'passenger name' is written 'The Rt Hon Neville Chamberlain'.

It notes that he left from Heston Aerodrome  and in the box marked 'Fare' it is written 'Special Flight'.

After the flight it was saved by British Airways founder George Denny and was found among his possessions following his death.

It is believed he kept the ticket as a souvenir as he would have appreciated the historic importance of the flight.

The ticket was tipped to fetch £15,000 but the private collector bid further on the ticket and it fetched £16,800 at Friday's auction.

In the spring of 1938, Hitler began openly to support the demands of German-speakers living in the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia for closer ties with Germany.

British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was intent on avoiding a war, despite the Czechoslovak government's hopes Britain and France would step in in the event of German invasion.

Chamberlain flew to Germany twice in September 1938 to offer Hitler favourable agreements, but the Fuhrer kept upping his demands.

On September 22, Hitler demanded the immediate cession of the Sudetenland to Germany and the evacuation of the Czechoslovak population by the end of the month.

It seemed that war was imminent and Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, unprepared for the outbreak of hostilities, traveled to Munich, where they gave in to Hitler's demands on September 30.

The prime minister signed a single page document with Hitler that he believed secured peace between Britain and Germany.

Later that day, Chamberlain flew home to Britain, where he addressed a jubilant crowd in London and praised the Munich Pact for bringing 'peace in our time'.

But the next day, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, and by March 1939, Hitler annexed the rest of Czechoslovakia, and the country ceased to exist.

And despite Chamberlain's elation, a year later Britain declared war on Germany and the Second World War began on September 3, 1939.
