Shocking: AEK Athens midfielder Giorgos Katidis raises his hand in a Nazi-style salute yesterday

This is the shocking moment when a footballer appeared to make a Nazi salute on the pitch.

AEK Athens midfielder Giorgos Katidis raised his right arm after scoring the winning goal in his side's 2-1 Super League win over Veria in Greece yesterday.

He was banned from all Greek national teams for life by the Hellenic Football Federation for the action, which said the action was ‘a profound insult to all victims of Nazi atrocities’ and condemned it ‘unequivocally and categorically’.

The Federation said in a statement: ‘The player's action to salute to spectators in a Nazi manner is a severe provocation, insults all the victims of Nazi bestiality and injures the deeply pacifist and human character of the game.’

Katidis was heavily criticised on social media for the celebration, although he later insisted he did not know the meaning of the gesture.

He was said to have claimed that he was pointing to team-mate Michalis Pavlis, who is recovering from injury, in the crowd.

Katidis said on Twitter: ‘I am not racist in any way. I abhor fascism. I would not have done it if I knew that it meant something. I know the consequences and would not do it ever.’

The Federation said the ban was a unanimous decision from its executive committee who met after the incident at the Athens Olympic Stadium.

AEK have demanded an apology from the player and said the board would meet to decide his future. But the club’s German coach Ewald Lienen backed Katidis.

‘He is a young kid who does not have any political ideas. He most likely saw such a salute on the internet or somewhere else and did it without knowing what it means,’ he said.

AEK are in 10th place in the table with 29 points from 26 games. Veria are fourth from bottom. Katidis has played for Greece's Under-17, U19 and U21 teams, but has not been capped at senior level.

He was captain for the U19 side and 
joined the club from Aris Salonika last year after impressing in 
Greece's run to the final of the European Under-19 Championship where 
they lost to Spain.

Today marks the 70th anniversary of Greek Jew deportations in Nazi concentration camps in the Second World War.

Jewish residents of Thessaloniki yesterday went to the city’s Freedom Square to mark the day.

David Saltiel, leader of the city's Jewish community, said: ‘The commemoration is an honor for the city of Thessaloniki. But some people look upon this era nostalgically and are bringing back the old Nazi symbols.’

He was referring to the emergence of the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn, a party with neo-Nazi roots that swept into Parliament for the first time in June on an anti-immigrant platform amid the country’s financial crisis.
