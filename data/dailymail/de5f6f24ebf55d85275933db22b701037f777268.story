A Taliban detainee released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has been put under 'intensified' surveillance in Qatar after he allegedly made contact with members of the al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network and tried to join their ranks.

The White House would not say today if the individual in question had actually contacted members of the Taliban as has been reported by news outlets and claimed by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. It simply said that monitoring measures on that former detainee had been 'updated to reflect those concerns.'

Only after a reporter pressed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue's spokesman Josh Earnest to confirm that monitoring had been 'intensified' did he admit that was the case.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not confirm today that a Taliban detainee released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl made contact with members of al Qaeda and tried to join the group's ranks. He did say one of the former prisoners has been put under 'intensified' surveillance in Qatar amid 'concerns'

Suspicious: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham claimed this week that the five former Gitmo detainees in Qatar have 'had some Haqqani people come to meet with them.' Graham suggested 'they're reaching out' to the terrorist group in hopes of rejoining the fight against the U.S.

Earlier this week, Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who recently visited Qatar, asserted that all five former Taliban fighters in Qatar's custody may be looking to return to the battlefield.

'They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan,' he told the Associated Press.

Under an agreement negotiated with the Taliban to free Bergdahl in May of 2014, the men must stay in Qatar for a year under surveillance. After that time, they may go wherever they please. 

Pointing out that 'it's just a year deal,' Graham told AP, 'Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.'

The South Carolina Republican, who is 'testing the waters' for a presidential run, said he was concerned one of the detainees had left Qatar, but was assured during his visit that all five senior Taliban officials remain in the tiny nation on the Arabian Peninsula. 

'I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,' he said. 

The White House said Friday that it is certain that all five prisoners are still under lock and key, and Earned gave reporters a full-throated assurances that monitoring measures 'mitigate' the threat posed by the former detainees.

'None of these individuals has returned to the battlefield, none of them is allowed to travel outside of Qatar, and none has engaged in physical violence,' he said. 'In fact, each of them, at this moment, is still in Qatar, and each of them is subject to monitoring and other mitigation efforts that limit their activity.'

Earnest said the U.S. is regularly' in touch with Qatar about the former prisoners and the fact that the monitoring was updated amid concerns shows that there is 'good cooperation' from Qatar and 'good coordination' between the two countries that 'is protecting American security.'

The top State Department spokeswoman made a similar observation during her Friday briefing.

'The fact that our mitigation measures helped alert us to potential concerns about one of these individuals means that our mitigation measures are working and have allowed us to make appropriate adjustments in a timely manner to properly mitigate any potential threats,' she said, according to CNN.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in May 2014 in exchange for the release of the five Taliban detainees from Guantanamo. Qatar now monitors the detainees and will continue to do so until the end of May

When previously contacted for comment by CNN, the White House had referred questions to the Pentagon which, in turn, declined to say which of the five men was allegedly in touch with the Taliban.

However, U.S. intelligence set up to intercept all five men's communications in Qatar has revealed that one of them 'reached out' in recent months to try to encourage militant activity, according to CNN.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees. 

'However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,' the statement said. 

'The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.'

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban, yet operates with some degree of autonomy. 

Even with knowledge that one of the prisoners included in the swap may be preparing to rejoin the fight against the U.S., the White House said today that it does not regret making the deal that allowed Sgt. Bergdahl to return home. 

Earnest said Obama was abiding by a 'principle, that has a lot of precedent, that this president is firmly committed to.' 

'As the Commander in Chief, it's his responsibility that no man or woman who wears the uniform of the United States military is left behind,' he said. 'That ultimately is where this debate stops for him.'

The president also stands by his commitment to shutdown the Guantanamo Bay prison for foreign fighters, his spokesman said, and 'only serves as a recruitment tool for terrorists' and damages America's standing with countries it needs as allies in the war on terror.

The U.S. has recently quickened the pace of the release of Guantanamo detainees as the Obama administration hopes to shut down the facility for good. The White House said Friday that allegations that one of the freed detainees was trying to rejoin the fight against the U.S. had not changed its calculus

Worth it? The White House says so.  It said today that it doesn't regret swapping the men for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, oictured here in this undated photo
