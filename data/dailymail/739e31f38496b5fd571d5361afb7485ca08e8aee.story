Legendary actor Robert Mitchum was known as a tough guy, but even he might not have had the stomach for U.S. politics, as son Chris Mitchum is now learning. 

The younger Mitchum has accused his opponent in a Southern California congressional race of running 'deceptive' campaign ads that twist his words.

Mitchum is squaring off against longtime Democrat incumbent Rep. Lois Capps.

Congressional candidate Chris Mitchum has accused his opponent in a Southern California congressional race of running 'deceptive' campaign ads that twist his words

He previously ran for office as a Republican in 2012 but did not get beyond the primary voters. 

Fox News says Capps' campaign pulled the ad after a call from Mitchum's lawyers.

The ad shows Mitchum apparently telling an interviewer that he doesn't 'intend to got to Washington to represent the 24th District.'

The video then cuts to Capps approving the message. 

Capps' camp maintains the clip is a fair representation of Mitchum's philosophy. which doesn't make the district's residents top priority

However Mitchum's appearance is part of a longer clip where he says he doesn't want to go to Washington 'to bring back baseball fields. That's not why I'm going.'

Tab Berg, a representative from Mitchum's campaign, calls it 'deceptive' editing.

'The Capps campaign pulled the ad quietly, and tried to tell reporters that it had nothing to do with getting caught,' he said. 'Capps neglected to respond to the media about the issue, and in fact has been a no-show at five debates planned by community groups.'

Mitchum has also countered the ad with a 'Truth' online fundraising effort centered on the clip.

Mitchum laughs as he says: 'When it comes to Lois Capps' campaign, you can't believe anything they say.'

However Capps' camp maintains the clip is a fair representation of Mitchum's philosophy. which doesn't make the district's residents top priority.

'My boss, on the other hand, has consistently advocated for the central coast,' spokesman Chris Meagher said of Capps.

Mitchum has a narrow 41.5-40.8 lead over Capps in the polls.
