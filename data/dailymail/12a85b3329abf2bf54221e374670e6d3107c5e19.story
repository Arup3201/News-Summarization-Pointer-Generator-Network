It may sound potty, but whistling to your baby could have him toilet-trained before he can walk.

A study of Vietnamese families credited whistling with getting babies out of nappies by just nine months. By the age of two, when many British toddlers are yet to start potty training, the Vietnamese children were managing the entire process by themselves.

Swedish researchers said potty training started almost from birth, with mothers making a whistling sound when their child gave a sign that they needed to go.

The children associated the whistling with urinating, and by the age of nine months, they were able to keep dry – as long as they were regularly reminded to sit on their potty, the Journal of Pediatric Urology reports.

The researchers said that while Western babies are potty trained later now than in the past, early toilet training has traditionally been regarded as a badge of pride in Vietnam.

They added that as well as saving on the cost of nappies and the time spent changing them, learning to control the bladder very early in life may be better for urinary health.

In the past, potty training often started before the age of one. But today’s mothers are advised to wait until their child is 18 months to two years old - and many begin even later.
