Former Lions and Wales forward Andy Powell once was once dubbed a 'scrumbag' after his wife accused him of cheating, gambling and lying, but the Newport Gwent Dragons No 8 has spoken of his joy as the reunited couple showed off their newborn son.

Powell's wife Natasha tweeted  his sexually explicit text messages, torched his clothes and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes following the couple's split last year.

But she later took back the Welsh forward after he promised to change his ways.

Andy Powell has spoken of his joy as he and his wife Natasha showed off their son, Henry

Powell (right) represented Wales on 23 occasions and was part of the 2011 Rugby World Cup squad 

Powell's career highlight was making Ian McGeechan's squad for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour 

The couple were all smiles this week as they posed for pictures with their son Henry Harman Gascoine-Powell, who was born two weeks early on New Year's Day. 

Powell, 33, said: 'I'm a real hands-on dad. I don't mind changing Henry's nappies and doing late night feeds.

'It's a mad feeling, absolutely crazy but completely enjoyable.

'I've got a few days off now to spend time with Tash and Henry and then I'll be back training. The boys have been great and sent us a top with Powell on the back for little Henry.'

The couple looked to be heading towards divorce after Natasha accused Powell of cheating on her 

On the day Henry was born, Powell called his team mates at the Newport Gwent Dragons to say he wouldn't make their afternoon match against Cardiff Blues. 

But Natasha's labour - which lasted just an hour and a half - was so quick he managed to get there in time to see his side lose 11-9 at Rodney Parade. 

Prolific tweeter Powell has also been sharing pictures on social media of his new experiences as a dad.

The latest photos show the incredible turnaround for the couple, who looked to be heading for a divorce last year.

The couple reunited when Natasha announced she was pregnant after a public falling out where she posted explicit pictures Powell sent to her (right) and sprayed 'cheat' over his house and pink Mercedes

Natasha Powell had sold her husband's belongings on eBay following suspicions that he had been cheating on her. 

She also claimed he paid for the wedding with gambling gains and got drunk before their big day and was nearly arrested.

She auctioned his wedding suit, rugby memorabilia and even romantic letters and cards she had received from him.

At the time she said: 'I've been pushed to the absolute limit. It's extreme to sell Andy's things on ebay but I can't get him to take me seriously. Everything about him I don't recognise anymore - he isn't the man I married.'

Powell's wife  even sold the suit her husband wore on their wedding day during their initial break-up

Powell has played for the Lions and Wales and fans were able to buy his boots for less than £20 online 

But the pair then reunited in May when Natasha discovered she was pregnant and friends have said they are now very happy.

Office worker Natasha, who had previously suffered two miscarriages, decided to give Andy one last chance for them to be a family.

She has said: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time.

'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track.

'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.'
