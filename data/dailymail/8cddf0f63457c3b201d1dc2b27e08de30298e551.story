For years Steve Wozniak dismissed claims that technology, and particularly artificial intelligence, could threaten humans.

But in a recent interview, the 64-year-old admitted he can now see some of the predictions coming true and that human-like computers could be a dangerous reality.

He even quipped: 'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on? I don't know.'

Steve Wozniak (pictured) admitted he had previously dismissed claims technology will threaten humans in the next 30 years but now realises the predictions are coming true. He even quipped 'Will we be the gods? Will we be the family pets? Or will we be ants that get stepped on? I don't know'

The Apple co-founder made the comments during an interview with Paul Smith at Australian Financial Review. 

He said: 'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question. If we build these devices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster than us and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently.

He directly referenced warnings issued by both Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking about the threat AI has on humanity. 

The pair is part of a group of experts, known collectively as the Future of Life Institute, who recently drafted an open letter saying scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind.

The authors said there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. 

But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak.

For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work.

Mr Wozniak directly referenced warnings issued by both Elon Musk (pictured) and Stephen Hawking about the threat AI has on humanity. For example, Tesla boss Mr Musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will, instead, be controlled by robots

Earlier this month Tesla boss Mr Musk said he believes humans could be banned from driving in years to come and all cars will, instead, be controlled by robots.

The entrepreneur claimed that computers will one day do a much better job of driving and that humans are simply ‘too dangerous’ behind the wheel. 

In a paper called Robots are Us: Some Economics of Human Replacement, lead researcher Seth Benzell  said: 'Whether it's bombing our enemies, steering our planes, fielding our calls, rubbing our backs, vacuuming our floors, driving our taxis, or beating us at Jeopardy, it's hard to think of hitherto human tasks that smart machines can't do or won't soon do.'

The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but packs enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair (pictured) or a floor-level bed to a bath, for example

A recent report by management consulting firm Boston Consulting Group predicted by 2025 the number of 'automatable' tasks will rise to 25 per cent.

This will lead to robots replacing many human jobs - and is a trend that has already begun in Japan. 

Earlier this week Riken-SRK Collaboration Centre for Human-Interactive Robot Research in Nagoya, Japan unveiled its latest Robear. 

The 'Robear' has a cub-like face but has enough strength to transfer patients from a wheelchair or a floor-level bed to a bath. 

It weighs 309lb (140kg) with extending legs that stop the 'bear' from falling over and it moves slowly and smoothly thanks to advance actuators in its mechanical arms.

And at the start of the month, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it will begin employing a humanoid called Nao in its branches from April, on a trial basis. 

And if the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. 

Elsewhere, in China there is a hotel manned entirely by robots. 

From reception desk staff to security doormen and waiters, the Pengheng Space Capsules Hotel in Shenzhen, China, has built, rather than hired, new employees.

Start-up costs and robot maintenance aside, staff bills are minimal and the hotel can pass these savings back to the customer as a night's stay costs just £6.80 per night. 

With this in mind, Mr Benzell and his colleagues at the National Bureau of Economic Research asked whether 'human replacement' - the act of building better versions of ourselves - will deliver an economic utopia or leave us earning too little to buy the goods the robots are making? 

Using a simulated economy, they found that the value of coders and developers will increase as the demand for smart machines rise.

As processes improve and technology advances, the price to produce these machines will decline, which will deliver a 'tech boom'. This in turn will raise the demand for new code. 

But over time, the stock of so-called 'legacy code' will grow because so many people are working on the projects, causing an abundance. 

Plus this code will ultimately cause machines to become smarter and learn how to use the legacy code themselves. 

Using a simulated economy, a recent paper found the value of coders will increase as demand for machines rise. As tech advances, costs will decline to deliver a 'tech boom'. But over time, the stock of so-called 'legacy code' will grow causing demand for new code and high-tech workers to drop and see them replaced by robots

The eventual decline in jobs will limit what young people can save and invest. This means less capital will be available for the future generations and means production could actually fall over time, despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently.

This will cause demand for new code and, thus for high-tech workers, to drop and see such workers replaced by robot employees. 

'The resulting tech bust reflects past humans obsolescing current humans. These robots contain the stuff of humans - accumulated brain and saving power,' said the paper.

'In fact, high-tech workers can start out earning far more than low-tech workers, but end up earning far less.' 

Artificial intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'.

Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity.

The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. 

Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence

The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind.

The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society.

It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research.

'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write.

But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak.

For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work.

In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming.

The paper uses the example of Junior, the reigning World Computer Chess Champion. Junior can beat every current and, possibly, every future human on the planet.

Consequently, his old code has largely put new chess programmers out of business. 

The eventual decline in high-tech and, potentially, low-tech workers income will limit what young people can save and invest, continued the paper.

This means less capital will be available for the future generations and production could actually fall over time, despite the fact machines are capable of producing goods more efficiently.

An alternative outcome of this is that high-skilled workers will move into low-skilled, lower paid positions, which will force these low-skilled workers into unemployment. And once people are out of work, welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy. The authors suggest people start saving for this eventuality

An alternative outcome of this is that high-skilled workers will move into low-skilled, lower paid positions, which will force these low-skilled workers into unemployment.  

And once people are out of work, welfare costs will rise putting a greater strain on the economy. The authors even suggest people start saving for this eventuality.

'The long run in such cases is no techno-utopia. Yes, code is abundant. But capital is dear. And yes, everyone is fully employed. But no one is earning very much,' said Mr Bezell. 

'In short, when smart machines replace people, they eventually bite the hands of those that finance them.'
