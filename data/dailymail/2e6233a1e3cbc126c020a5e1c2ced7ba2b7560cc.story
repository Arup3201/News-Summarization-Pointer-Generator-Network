Arrest: Dioscoro Flores, 39, allegedly sexually abused a paralyzed patient in his care

A registered male nurse has been arrested for allegedly fondling a paralyzed Afghanistan war veteran who is unable to speak.

The 24-year-old paraplegic told his father about the alleged abuse at the hands of 39-year-old Dioscoro Flores by using eye movements and a board to spell out words, a police report said.

Flores has been charged with sexual abuse for two attacks that allegedly took place in the soldier's room at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago between July 4 and August 6.

The unidentified soldier, who was paralyzed after an incident in May, told his father about the abuse a day after the second alleged incident, the Chicago Tribune reported.

The man used his eyes and a 'spell board' to form words. He looks up to indicate 'yes' and down to indicate 'no'. Through this method, he told his father about the alleged abuse.

'It was shock at first and then anger 
afterward,' the father told the Tribune. 'You know ... just kind of knowing that 
something like that could have happened.'

After being certain of what his son was saying, he went to staff who then carried out an internal investigation.

He spoke again to his son, who said he 
wanted to file charges, so he also contacted police who he believes have
carried out a thorough investigation.

'I'm proud of him for saying something,' he said of his son.

The man was a sharpshooter and served in Afghanistan between June 2011 and August 2012. He suffered an injury in May that left him paralized but his father did not provide any further details.

His father said that his son still has all of his cognitive abilities and hopes that he will be able to speak again one day.

'It's life,' he said. 'You learn to adapt and move on. You never know one day to the next what's going on... With our family, we've learned to adapt. We're working on getting him back home.'

Flores was arrested this week and has been ordered held on $50,000 bail.
