The victim of a brutal castration and his lover who allegedly murdered him were openly affectionate and in love, a close friend told the court today.

Portuguese underwear model Renato Seabra, 21, is accused of murdering fashion journalist Carlos Castro, 65, while they were on vacation at the InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan last year.

Wanda Pires, a close friend of Castro, said her friend described the relationship as 'the best thing that ever happened in his life'.

Ms Pires said Mr Castro had given the aspiring model free rein with his credit card and had planned trips to shopping malls, casinos and basketball games during their vacation, according to the New York Post.

The ambitious younger man was also hoping to find modelling work through a Manhattan agency.

Ms Pires added that the couple, who had been together since October 2010, were so in love they would even feed each other over meals.

She added: 'Every time they went to eat they were sharing food with each other… very friendly, very happy.'

However according to Pires' testimony, Seabra taunted Castro by trying to get the phone numbers of young women on the day before the murder. 

The relationship between the two soured when Castro later caught Seabra going out with a group of young women.

On January 7, 2011, tensions came to a head when Seabra and Castro got into a 
fight over the older man's plans to send his lover home, thus signalling
the end of their whirlwind romance.

Ms Pires told jurors that she spoke to Castro on the morning he died and he said the couple had fought all night and Seabra had declared he was no longer gay.

Aspiring model: The defense claims that Seabra, 21, had a psychotic break when he murdered his older lover while on vacation in New York

Murder trial: Defense lawyers for Seabra have claimed that he suffered a psychotic break whereas the prosecution said that he strangled and mutilated Castro out of rage

The prosecution hope to debunk the defense's claim that Seabra fell into an hour-long psychotic
fit when he bludgeoned Castro with a TV, strangled him and then cut off
his testicles with a corkscrew while he was still alive.

District Attorney Maxine Rosenthal earlier 
described Seabra as a hot-headed, gold-digger who realized that his free
ride was over and killed Castro out of anger, not insanity.

Defense attorney Rubin Sinins told jurors last week during opening testimony that Seabra had a psychotic fit when he cut off his lover's testicles and slit his own wrists.

'He put one [testicle] on each wrist,' 
Sinins told the court. 'He did this for his protection. He could also 
harness the power.

'He wandered the streets of Manhattan, touching 
people, because he had the power to cure people from AIDS, because he 
had the power to cure them.'

Luxury: Castro and Seabra had a huge fight while staying at the high-end InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan which ended in Castro's brutal death

The lawyer went on, telling the jury 
that Seabra explained to police the day after the murder that ‘he 
believed Mr. Castro's testicles were demons, and that by pulling them 
out everything would be right with the world'.

The lawyer asked the jury to acquit 
Seabra by reason of insanity, with the possibility of being committed to
a psychiatric facility.

‘He was in another world,’ Sinins told
jurors. ‘He was deluded into thinking that he was a special messenger 
from God, on a mission to make the world a better place.’

However,
the prosecution implored the panel not to believe the psychotic episode
story, insisting that there was nothing in the 21-year-old’ medical 
history to suggest even mild mental illness.

Court papers presented by prosecutors
described a statement police said Seabra gave after the January 7 death
of Mr Castro while the two were on holiday in Manhattan.

The account depicted an argument in a 
hotel room that turned vicious and escalated into a prolonged hour-long 
frenzy, with Seabra first choking his companion, then stabbing him with a
corkscrew in his face and groin.

Seabra
also admitted to hitting Mr Castro on the head with a monitor 
and stamping on his face while wearing shoes, the papers said.

After the attack Seabra told police, he showered, put on a suit and left.

The 21-year-old, Seabra, was a 
contestant in 2010 on a Portuguese television show called A Procura Do 
Sonho, or 'Pursuit Of A Dream', which hunts for modelling talent.

Although
he did not win the show, he gained a modelling contract with an agency 
founded by designer Fatima Lopes, who developed the show and was a 
judge.

Ms Pires' testimony continues this afternoon.
