Ray Parlour believes Arsenal will be better equipped to mount a Premier League title challenge next season if they finish this campaign by winning the FA Cup.

The former England midfielder insists the players will benefit psychologically from ending the club’s nine-year wait for a trophy. Nobody in the squad has lifted silverware in England before.

Parlour won three League titles, four FA Cups, and one League Cup during his 12-year career at Arsenal and knows how success breeds success.

Long time coming: Arsenal have not won silverware since lifting the 2005 FA Cup in Cardiff

In eight years under Arsene Wenger he won six trophies and is unwavering in his support for the Frenchman, who last guided Arsenal to silverware in 2005.

Parlour, who left the summer before that FA Cup triumph, also played for Hull City and says a win for Steve Bruce’s team would make history – but it would affect the future for Arsenal.

‘They will be under a lot of pressure having not won anything for so long,’ says Parlour. ‘It would be really bad if that continued. I’m not sure what effect that might have.

‘But on the other side, winning the FA Cup would give players that confidence and belief. A lot of them haven’t won anything before and that can be a mental hurdle to overcome.

‘I know, having experienced it, that lifting trophies in whatever competition makes your stronger, you’re then a winner. I would expect victory to boost the team for a title challenge in the Premier League next season.’

Parlour believes more money will be spent in the transfer window, with the £42.5million capture of Mesut Ozil last summer a marker that years of saving are over. He predicts Wenger could be handed as much as £100million to splash on reinforcements.

We all know what Arsene Wenger has been working with at the club, the new stadium meant he had to balance the books and couldn’t compete with the elite clubs in Europe on fees and wages.

‘But signing Ozil showed that has changed. They need a top quality centre-forward and probably a holding midfielder. I think Ozil will improve next year after adjusting to England – it is hard to go without a winter break when you’ve had one your entire career – and more quality signings will come.’
