A group of daredevil climbers have shown just how fearless they are after camping out on the side of a frozen cliff face in frigid Kyrgyzstan.

These jaw-dropping photos show climbers Thomas Senf, Ines Papert and Wolfgang Rusegger taking a break while scaling Mount Kyzyl Asker in Central Asia.

The adrenaline junkies were tackling the 19,000ft mountain when a storm forced them to stop in their tracks just 985ft from the summit.

Thomas Senf, Ines Papert and Wolfgang Rusegger camped out on the side of Mount Kyzyl Asker in Kyrgyzstan when bad weather struck

The adrenaline junkies were tackling the 19,000ft mountain when a storm forced them to stop in their tracks just 985ft from the summit

 Unfortunately for the climbers they were forced to abandon their icy climb due to the storm, which brought heavy snow and avalanches

With the deteriorating conditions posing a significant threat to their safety they quickly jumped into their sleeping bags and braced themselves for the storm, which brought heavy snow and triggered avalanches.

Thomas’ photographs have only recently been revealed to the public after the 2010 expedition.

The 33-year-old said: ‘It was a kind of “1,000-star hotel” experience, a very unique experience.

‘Especially at a place like this where you can see for a hundred kilometres without any lights from a house.’

Thomas shared the photos after he witnessed shots of climbers Kevin Jorgenson and Tommy Caldwell, who recently scaled - and camped - their way up El Capitan.

Thomas Senf's photographs have only recently been revealed to the public after the group attempted to scale the mountain in 2010

Thomas Senf, from Bernese Oberland, Switzerland, said the group was bombarded with snow and avalanches when the storm hit

But unfortunately for Thomas' group, the weather meant they never completed the icy climb.

Thomas, from Bernese Oberland, Switzerland, added: ‘That night we were hit by avalanches the whole night and a snowstorm that didn't stop.

‘It became clear there was nobody except ourselves who could help. At least the temperature helped to cool down the nerves.’
