With the Miss USA crown comes great responsibility - and a stalker too apparently.

Newly crowned Miss USA Erin Brady is experiencing some of the downsides of being a famous pagaent winner. A man maned 'Larry' has been lingering around her apartment building and pagaent headquarters in New York City. 

The stalker was quickly arrested Thursday after the New York Post published an article about him. Lanre Orimabogunje, 28, was tracked down to a Brooklyn homeless shelter after writing his name in a book near the pageant winner's building. He had a picture of Miss Brady in his pocket and made incriminating statements to the police.

Law enforcement officials said that the stalker mumbled nonsense about Miss Brady's crown and attempted to touch her head. The man told Miss Brady's doorman that he had been 'tracking her since she was born.'

Brady's grandmother Theresa Brady said he even went so far as to go upstairs to the pageant winner's floor in her building.

'She didn't say a word - she locked the door, then called downstairs to the desk,' Theresa Brady told the Post.

Miss Brady was crowned Miss USA this past June and was the first winner from Connecticut. She will compete in the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, Russia on November 9 - the day she originally planned to get married to fiance Tony Capasso. Now they have to wait for her year as Miss USA to be up to get married, per competition rules.

The news of Miss Brady's stalking comes just days after Miss Teen USA admitted to being stalked herself.

Cassidy Wolf, the 19-year-old winner from Temecula, California says she was cyber-stalked for months by a stranger who hacked her computer to take pictures of her using her webcam and used the photos as extortion.

After she was 
named Miss Teen California, Miss Wolf traveled to schools near her home to talk with students about how to protect themselves from 
cyber-crimes.

During her one-year reign, she hopes to spread her story as a warning to others.

'This next year I’m just so excited to be able to share my story 
and raise awareness in young teens about what can happen,' she said.

Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety

She said that people can
protect themselves by changing their passwords frequently and deleting 
browsing history regularly. She also suggested putting a sticker over 
the webcam when it's not being used.
