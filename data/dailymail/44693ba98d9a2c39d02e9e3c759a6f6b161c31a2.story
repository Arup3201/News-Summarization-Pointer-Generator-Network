Martin Howe, who is spearheading the group's claim, says he and 18 other Irish travellers suffered 'race discrimination' when a they were turned away from a Wetherspoon pub

A group of Irish gipsies are suing pub chain J D Wetherspoon for up to £100,000 over 'race discrimination' allegations after they were turned away from a pub.

A top lawyer, a Catholic priest and a retired police inspector are among a 19-strong group of travellers who claim they were told they could not enter The Coronet, in Islington, North London, because they are gipsies.

The group visited the pub after a meeting of the Irish Traveller Movement in Britain (ITMB) charity at their headquarters next door to the pub.

The gipsies told Central London County Court that 'the doormen told them that they were not allowing travellers or people from the traveller conference to enter'.

The case against JD Wetherspoon Plc is being spearheaded by Martin Howe, a partner in a leading law firm, Father Joseph Browne, a Catholic priest, and Mark Watson, a recently retired police inspector who served 30 years with the Cheshire force. 

They are seeking a declaration that they were the victims of racism, up to £100,000 in damages and a public apology.  

Wetherspoon vehemently denies discrimination and says the pub's entrance policy in force on the day had 'nothing to do with race.'

Marc Willers QC, representing the travellers, told Central London County Court: 'The claimants seek a declaration and damages from J D Wetherspoon Plc in relation to the direct race discrimination which they allegedly suffered on November 17 2011. 

'Put shortly, they contend that their treatment by J D Wetherspoon employees or agents constituted direct discrimination.

'They treated them less favourably than others because the claimants were Irish travellers, or associated with Irish travellers.

'The remedies sought by the claimants are a declaration and damages, including damages for injury to feelings and aggravated damages.'

Setting the scene, the barrister said: 'Father Joseph Browne is the ITMB's chair. At the end of the conference, at about 4.30 pm, he invited the delegates to join him for a drink at The Coronet public house which was situated next door.

'When the first group of delegates arrived at 4.45pm ... the doormen told them they were not allowing travellers or people from the traveller conference to enter The Coronet.'

The group claim they were not allowed into The Coronet in Islington, north London, by bouncers who were told not to allow Irish travellers in

Mr Willers said that Mr Watson, who was then a serving police officer but has since retired, produced his warrant card and asked if the manager would explain what was going on.

At this point, the group claim that a third doorman appeared and explained that entry was barred because of problems after the same conference last year. 

The group were eventually allowed into the pub - on condition that Mr Watson 'vouch for' and 'keep an eye' on them - but later walked out and joined others waiting outside. 

Irish traveller Pauline Anderson, a trustee of the charity who works in primary education for Sheffield City Council, told Judge John Hand QC that being turned away 'upset' her.

'I was told that nobody from the conference could be allowed into the pub. The doormen were not allowing entrance to anyone who had been at our conference,' she said. 

'They explained that they had their instructions from the management of the pub. I was not told that large groups would not be allowed in. 

'I had a conversation immediately afterwards about how upset I was and still am.' 

Thomas Kibling, for Wetherspoon’s, pointed out that the group was allowed to enter after Mr Watson agreed to 'take responsibility' for them. 

Judge Hand has now reserved his decision on the case until a later date, following a 13-day hearing.
