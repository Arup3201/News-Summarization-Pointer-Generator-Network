A council worker claimed £9,128 in compensation for tripping over a mop

A council worker who tripped over a mop has been awarded thousands of pounds in damages.

The 61-year-old cleaner, employed by Rotherham Council, South Yorkshire, was paid £9,128 after stumbling over a mop handle, falling and pulling a groin muscle.

Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed that since 2007 the same council has paid out a whopping £1million in compensation to other workers for minor slips, trips and falls.

A teacher, carer, administrative assistant and a weed sprayer received £26,867 between them after falling off chairs.

A 53-year-old town hall admin assistant tripped over a 'protruding' dining table leg in 2010 and was handed £14,452.

The same year, a labourer was given £10,450 after he was working in the garden of a council house and fell into a hidden pond.

A 38-year-old woman housing assistant sued the council and won £16,500 in 2008 after falling because of a pothole in the work car park.

A watersports instructor, 25, was given £14,000 compensation after he slipped in a gap in a jetty walkway at a country park.

Claims by council employees have cost ratepayers in the town an average of £193,558 a year over the last five years.

Robert Oxley of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘Rotherham Council must cut down on the number and cost of avoidable accidents.

‘The bill to taxpayers for compensation is unacceptably high . While some staff might have legitimate claims because of negligence, there is a worrying rise in compensation culture across local government offices.

‘Taxpayers should not be footing the bill for cases where a bit of common sense would have avoided an accident.'

In other claims two home carers, aged 
35 and 65, claimed £9,800 between them after being injured while moving a
patient in bed in October 2008.

Four
months later the council had to pay a further £33,740 to another home 
carer, aged 44, who developed a back problem from lifting clients.

A dozen road workers successfully claimed £184,183 between them for health problems from using vibrating machinery.

Claims for hearing problems from working in noisy situations averaged one claim a year totalling £25,155.

Deputy leader of the council Jahangir 
Akhtar said: ‘From time to time things do go wrong and our staff may 
incur a financial loss or suffer a personal injury. Each case is taken 
on merit and, in being fair to our employees, we will always accept 
responsibility and compensate people in situations where it is proven we
are legally liable to do so.

‘The
council prides itself on its risk assessment and health and safety 
policies and continues to invest in this area to maintain our good 
record and ensure the welfare and safety or our employees.

Rotherham Council has paid out £1million in compensation since 2007

‘Examples of work being done include robust training processes for staff and raising awareness of the potential risks in the workplace.

‘Our efforts have resulted in year on year decreases in the number of individually reported incidents in the four years between 2007 and 2010, which has also ensured that the annual sums paid out have decreased significantly.’

The largest single payment was £212,211 to the family of road worker Gordon Duffield, 51, who was crushed to death by a tipper wagon in May 2007.

Rotherham Council are not the only ones to use taxpayers' money to pay out large amounts of compensation, however.

In April this year, a failed asylum seeker was awarded £750million after he lodged a claim that said his human rights had been abused after he was not allowed to have sex with his girlfriend. It was then revealed that a mistake had been made and a judge struck out his claim.

Last year, £18,750 compensation was paid out by Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex, to a person hit by a bed pushed by a porter.

Salford Royal NHS Trust handed £10,860 to a worker injured by slipping over in the shower.

And, Rotherham NHS Trust gave £43,500 to a cleaner who suffered breathing problems from toilet cleaner.

In 2010, eighteen violent criminals held in solitary confinement raked in £40,000 compensation by claiming it breached their human rights. One man won £2,100 for being held in isolation at HMP Kilmarnock before claiming that the payout was not high enough.

In 2009, figures revealed that classroom
staff and other school workers had won almost £1.5million in 
compensation over a five year period. The figures also showed that students and their families grabbed over £600,000 to cover loss or damage to their mobile phones.
