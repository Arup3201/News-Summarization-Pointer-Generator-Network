Tony Pulis will only accept the vacant manager’s position at West Bromwich Albion if he is given sole charge of first-team affairs at the club.

An agent and a lawyer representing the former Stoke and Crystal Palace boss have been in talks with the West Brom hierarchy after the dismissal on Monday night of first team coach Alan Irvine.

But Sportsmail understands Pulis sent in his representatives with strict instructions not to agree to a position that fits into the current management structure of the struggling Premier League club.

At nearly 57 Pulis has no interest in allowing a technical director to recruit his players when he prefers to trust his own judgement. It was over recruitment that he parted company with Palace in the summer and it is an area in which he will not compromise.

Indeed Sportsmail understands Pulis has already rejected the advances of Newcastle, who are also understood to have approached him through intermediaries but stated immediately that he would have to fit into their own management structure with owner Mike Ashley and head scout Graham Carr.

It means West Brom owner and chairman Jeremy Peace would have to rethink the structure of a club that currently has Terry Burton as technical director – and head of recruitment – and Richard Garlick as sporting director.

But the fact Peace has contacted Pulis through intermediaries would suggest he might be ready to accept the terms of a more traditional manager given the difficulties West Brom have endured since losing Roy Hodgson and Dan Ashworth to the FA.

If that is the case, Pulis will then agree to meeting Peace to discuss the finer details of becoming the next manager of West Brom.

The club have also made contact with former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood, who came close to landing the job last summer before talks broke down over wages and his desire to bring in assistants Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey.

Sherwood has been out of work for nearly eight months since leaving Spurs.
