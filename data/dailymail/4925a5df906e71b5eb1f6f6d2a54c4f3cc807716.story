Darren Bent joined Championship side Brighton on loan from Aston Villa because he was at 'boiling point' after his frustrating spell at Villa Park. 

The former England international, signed for Villa from Sunderland for £18million in 2011, but made little impact under Paul Lambert, with Seagulls boss Sami Hyypia swooping for the ex-Tottenham man.

Bent, who has represent England on 13 occasions, spent last season on loan at Fulham.

'I just want to play and I'd reached my boiling point,' Bent told BBC Sussex.

'It was hard not playing in Paul's first season, but this was worse. The team was struggling, not scoring goals and you still don't get a chance. There are only so many slaps in the face you can take.' 

Bent is looking forward to getting some more first-team football under his belt at Brighton. 

The 30-year-old forward joined the Midlands club for £18m but struggled to get into the team

Hyypia's side currently occupy 20th place in the Championship table and Bent is eager to help his new side rise up the table in the coming months. 

'Anyone who knows me knows I just want to work hard all week and play on Saturday,' added Bent.

'I want to slot in at Brighton and do everything I can to help them improve. I'm just desperate to play football because it's been far too long.'
