The sixth victim, a 20-year-old male who was driving the 2004 Chevrolet Impala at the time of the crash, has not been identified.

Police say the driver lost control after the back passenger-side tire of the car hit a curb. The vehicle slid across three lanes before hitting a tree in the median. 

Four of the passengers were pronounced dead on the scene, while the other two died later in the hospital. 

The three teens who lost their lives all played football at Kimball High School in Oak Park, Texas. Woodberry and Haskin were freshmen, and Johnson a sophomore.

Rhonda Woodberry, Trey's mother, described her son as 'friendly' and 'outgoing,' and said the 15-year-old had been nervous about meeting new friends at his high school.

She added that while she knew Haskin and Johnson, she did not know the other three passengers in the car, or where they were going at the time of the crash.

On Monday night, several hundred people gathered together for a candlelight vigil on Bonnie View Road, where the accident occurred.

'They were good kids and seemed like they were going to be really good leaders,' Kimball football coach Carlton Nelson said of the three.

He also spoke of how popular Johnson was with fellow players, always making people laugh and pulling pranks. 

'We called him our little Warren Sapp,' said Nelson, referring to the football star and Hall of Famer who was also known as a jokester.

'He [Johnson] kept the other kids laughing and playing.'

A spokesperson for the school district, André Riley, said in a statement,  'Dallas ISD is deeply saddened to learn that three students at Justin F. Kimball High School have died as the result of a traffic accident on Aug. 30 in Oak Cliff.' 

'Grief counselors will be at Kimball and both T.W. Browne Middle School and Daniel Webster Elementary School, where siblings of the victims are enrolled, to help those school communities address this loss.'

Police say that while speed was a major factor in the accident, they do not believe alcohol was involved.
