The United Kingdom is a nation divided by wealth, health and patriotism, a new study revealed today.

From fertility and baby names to life expectancy and immigration, there are stark differences between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

The new Compendium of UK Statistics draws together data from across the four nations of the UK, and reveals how life varies dramatically depending on where you live.

The Office for National Statistics insisted the report is more than an interesting account of life in the UK.

The Office for National Statistics released the Compendium of UK Statistics to reveal how life varies between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland 

‘It has been produced to facilitate comparisons and is intended to help support key decisions such as the forthcoming Scottish referendum on independence which is due to take place on 18 September 2014, the ONS said.

It shows that while people in England generate the most wealth and have highest disposable income, they receive the least in spending on public services.

England is also the most crowded nation, home to people with the highest life expectancy, highest fertility and the biggest appetite for drinking alcohol.

By contrast Scotland has the highest employment rate and lowest household wealth and fertility least fertile.

Scots are also the most patriotic and catch almost two thirds of the UK’s fish.

Wales is home to more people born in the rest of the UK, has the highest rate of recycling, has the cheapest mortgages but the least disposable income.

In Northern Ireland meanwhile, unemployment is highest and life expectancy lowest, but it received more in public money per head and has the cheapest houses.

Here we take a look at the treasure trove of information and what it tells us about the state of the nation.  

The vast bulk of people in the UK live in England. Of the 63.7million people in the four nations in 2012, 84 per cent were in England, 8.3 per cent in Scotland, 4.8 per cent in Wales and just 2.9 per cent in Northern Ireland.

Little wonder, then, that England is much more crowded than the rest of the country.

There are 411 people per sq km in England, compared to just 146 in Wales, 134 in Northern Ireland and 68 in Scotland.

A more detailed breakdown shows the difference between our cities and the countryside is even more stark.

The most crowded area is Islington, north London where 14,206 people are squeezed into each sq km.

The highest population density outside London is in Portsmouth, where each sq km has 5,118 jostling for space.

Life could get lonely in the least populated areas, with just 26 people per sq km in Powys in Wales and 36 per sq km in Moyle in Northern Ireland.

In the Scottish area of Highland and Eileen Siar there are just 9 people in each sq km, the lowest anywhere in the UK.

Things could be about to get more crowded, at least in some areas.

By 2037 the UK population is projected to rise by 15 per cent to 73.3million.

While England expects population growth of around 0.6 per cent per year, Northern Ireland will grow by 0.4 per cent and Scotland and Wales just 0.3 per cent.

In every part of the country the population is getting older. From 2012 to 2037 the number of pensioners will rise by 31 per cent, with the steepest annual rise expected in Northern Ireland 1.4 per cent.

Wales is home to more people born in the rest of the UK – 21.8 per cent are from England, Scotland or Northern Ireland.

While 84 per cent of the population lives in England, 87 per cent of immigrants live there, Just two per cent of the 498,000 immigrants in the UK live in Northern Ireland. 

Northern Ireland is the most fertile, with a fertility rate of 2.03 compared to 1.67 in Scotland.

The names of the babies born in the different countries also vary. In 2012 the most popular names for boys and girls in England were Harry and Amelia, while in Wales they were Jack and Amelia.

In both Scotland and Northern Ireland most boys were called Jack and most girls, Sophie.

Ahead of the independence referendum, patriotism appears to be highest in Scotland.

Some 83 per cent of people living there felt they had some Scottish national identity, compared to 70 per cent of people in England who has some English national identity and 66 per cent of the Welsh in Wales.

England is the economic powerhouse of the UK, generating the most wealth per person.

Yet it receives much less in spending on public services.

Economic activity per head, known as Gross Value Added, is estimated at £21,295 across the UK.

In England the figure is almost £700 higher, at £21,937, suggesting the economic output outstrips the rest of the country.

In Scotland GVA is £20,013, Northern Ireland £16,217 and Wales just £15,401.

Prodictivty is also highest in England, 1.5 per cent above the UK average, with Scotland 2.6 per cent below, Wales 14.8 per cent and Northern Ireland 17.2 per cent blow.

However, public spending per person is almost in reverse to the wealth generated.

In 2012-13, Northern Ireland had the highest state spending per head - £10,876, followed by Scotland £10,152 and Wales £9,709.

Only England had a public spending per head (£8,529) which was lower than the UK average of £8,788.

Scotland paid the most tax per person at £7,056 per household, Northern Ireland £5,647 and Wales £5,564. Figures were not available for England.

In the first three months of 2014 employment was highest in Scotland at 73.5 per cent and lowest in Northern Ireland at 67.8 per cent.

Levels of public sector employment also varies widely, with 27.9 per cent in state-funded jobs in Northern Ireland compared to just 17.4 per cent in England.

Weekly earnings were highest in England at £520.50, followed by Scotland (£508.30), Wales (£472.30) and Northern Ireland which had the lowest earnings (£460.00).

The new data reveals how the small things which mark big differences in the way we live our lives

The English drink more, the Welsh recycle more and Scots are better qualified.

In 2012, 12 per cent of over-16s in England had drunk alcohol on five or more days in the last week, compared with 8 per cent in Wales and 9 per cent in Scotland.

In 2010-12, England also had the highest male and female life expectancy at birth at 79.0 years for boys and 82.8 years for girls.

Wales had the second highest life expectancy for males at 78.1 years, while life expectancy for females was 82.1 years.

In Northern Ireland life expectancy at birth for females was also 82.1 years, while for males it was 77.7 years. Scotland had the lowest life expectancy at birth at 76.5 years for males and 80.7 years for females.

On education, 17.2 per cent of people in Northern Ireland have no qualifications at all while in Scotland 29.4 have an NVQ level 4 or above.

People in Wales seem to be the most environmentally friendly. The household recycling rate was 49 per cent in Wales (49 per cent), followed by England (43 per cent) Northern Ireland (40 per cent). Separate figures for Scotland show a rate of 40-41 per cent.

Scotland is responsible for landing 60 per cent of all of the UK’s fish supplies, worth £457million.

Average house prices are highest in England, worth £261,000 and lowest in Northern Ireland, £136,000.

Rents are lowest in Northern Ireland, at £41 per week, but mortgage bills are lowest in Wales, at £101 per week.

Families in England spend £491-a-week, more than £80 more than the £411.30 in Wales.

Some 23 per cent of children live in low income households in Northern Ireland, compared to only 17 per cent in Scotland.

England is home to 84 per cent of the UK’s cars and makes 91 per cent of the UK’s rail journeys.
