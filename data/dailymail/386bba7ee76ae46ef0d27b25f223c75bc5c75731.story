A legal firm has taken £2.5 million in taxpayers money from a public inquiry into the deaths of Iraqi men - even though the investigation's key claim has now been abandoned due to a lack of evidence.

Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers represented the relatives of more than 20 Iraqis who claimed the men were taken prisoner by British soldiers, and later mistreated and murdered.

Despite the relatives withdrawing their claims last week, the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry confirmed that it has spent more than £22million of public money on the investigation - including handing £2.5million over to Public Interest Lawyers run by the 'committed socialist' solicitor Phil Shiner.

A spokesperson for the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry told MailOnline: 'The 
£2.5 million has all gone to PIL [Public Interest Lawyers] but that’s 
not just legal costs. It’s also the cost for witnesses: expenses for 
witnesses to come over from Iraq and to hear some of them via video link
 from overseas.'

It is understood that the money received by Public Interest Lawyers included covering the cost of flying and accommodating 15 key witnesses in Britain, as the Al-Sweady Inquiry's chairman Sir Thayne Forbes wanted to see them face-to-face.

It also included the building of - and transport to and from - a 'small studio' close to Iraq from which an additional 40 family members of the deceased gave evidence.

As Public Interest Lawyers were the only 
legal firm working with the Al-Sweady Inquiry, all the expenses of 
gathering evidence from witnesses went through them the spokesperson said.

Public Interest Lawyers is currently acting for more than 100 clients who claim their relatives were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq.

It has secured more than £3million in payouts, most notably, representing the family of Baha Mousa - the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in custody in Iraq. The subsequent inquiry cost £13million.

Responding to claims that Public Interest Lawyers earned, as opposed to received £2.5million from the inquiry, Phil Shiner said: 'The amount of costs PIL has received from the MoD [not Legal Aid!] for that issue is less than £70,000.'

The Al-Sweady Inquiry was announced in 2009 after a long legal battle between Iraqi families and the Ministry of Defence.

It examined allegations that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others after a battle at the Danny Boy base near Basra in May 2004.

The inquiry was named after Hameed Al Sweady, 19 - one of the men that died.

Witnesses and family members of the dead Iraqis had alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge at a camp and detention facility for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year earlier.

The claims were strenuously denied by the Ministry of Defence, which insisted the Iraqis were insurgents killed in battle.

Enemy dead would normally be left on the battlefield but the soldiers were apparently given an order to identify them in order to find the ringleader in the six Red Caps murder.

Last week the inquiry's key claim was abandoned when relatives of the dead Iraqis admitted there was no evidence the men had been killed unlawfully and withdrew their claims.

The Ministry of Defence later said it was pleased the claims had been withdrawn.

Last week the primary strand of the Al-Sweady Inquiry 
effectively fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard 
evidence to suggest the insurgents were unlawfully killed in UK custody.

In
 a statement released as evidence drew to a close, Public Interest 
Lawyers accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight, 
dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, near Basra in 2004.

They admitted no evidence had been produced to suggest the men had been murdered unlawfully.

The
 extraordinary concession provoked outrage that British troops accused 
of the most serious crime have had their names 'dragged through the mud'
 by publicly-funded lawyers.

At
 the time, Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded UK forces in Afghanistan,
 said: ‘Many in Iraq and Afghanistan have sought to discredit British 
soldiers for political purposes or have made claims for personal 
financial gain.

‘In some 
cases, these people have been wittingly or unwittingly looking to turn a
 quick buck at the expense of our fighting troops.

‘It
 is tough for the MoD, who are under great pressure to answer these 
cases, but to avoid wasting public funds we must be ready to make 
stronger rebuttal.’

Phil 
Shiner, the boss of Public Interest Lawyers, describes himself as a 
'committed socialist' on his company's website and has insisted the 
business is 'not motivated by financial gain'.

Following the developments last week, the Mail 
revealed that to investigate Mr Shiner’s clients’ claims, a team of 12 
former Scotland Yard murder squad officers, commanded by a retired chief
 superintendent was recruited by the Al-Sweady Inquiry.

Their role was research and evidence gathering, including taking statements from Iraqi witnesses and British soldiers.

The
 senior policeman is understood to have been paid more than £1,000 a day
 plus expenses. Junior investigators on the inquiry team were paid £400 a
 day.

Along with three lawyers from Public Interest Lawyers, the investigators made four visits to Beirut to interview witnesses.

Each
 trip lasted two to three weeks, officials said. They flew business 
class and the group stayed at the five-star Gefinor Rotana Hotel, which 
is described on its website as being of ‘spellbinding luxury’.

Suites
 were hired to interview Iraqi witnesses, who stayed at a more modest 
hotel in the city but were permitted to dine at the Gefinor Rotana.

They
 were also given a 'generous' daily living allowance.

The
 inquiry team later made three business class trips to Istanbul, where 
they stayed in the five-star Grand Hyatt Hotel, as they interviewed 
Iraqi witnesses.

The Iraqis 
again stayed in a less expensive hotel but were allowed to dine in the 
inquiry team’s hotel and enjoy a daily living allowance.

Investigative and ‘other expert 
services’ accounted for £7million. Running costs including IT and 
accommodation cost £5.9million, counsel and legal services a further 
£4.9million, core participant and witness costs £2.5million and general 
staffing £1.8million.

This led to the total bill for the inquiry topping £22million at the end of February.

But
 sources have told the Mail last week that the actual total is closer to 
£27million – six times the bill of the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen 
Lawrence’s murder.

Speaking to MailOnline this morning, the Al-Sweady Inquiry spokesperson said: 'Over 
four years, [the £2.5 million] has gone on getting statements from 91 
Iraqi witnesses. We’ve tested the evidence of 55 of them. So the money 
has gone on that and all the related legal costs in the hearing and 
taking evidence from all those witnesses.'

'The most
 important witnesses – that is to say the nine who were detained by 
British forces and who make the allegations, and another six who were 
key to the central allegations – the chairman wanted to see them in 
person, in the hearing room, and to be able to see them face to face,' 
they added.

'So we made 
arrangements for them to fly from Iraq too here. The other 40 – who were
 family members of the deceased – we set up a purpose built, very small 
studio overseas in a secure location closer to Iraq so we could they 
evidence via video link because it’s considerably less hassle and less 
expensive than getting them over here,' the spokesperson went on.

In a statement to MailOnline, Public Interest Lawyers said: 'PIL has received approximately just under £1.83m from the Al-Sweady Inquiry. Of that figure £670,990.64 is attributable to PIL’s costs and of that sum less than 10 per cent is attributable to work in relation to the issue that was conceded last Friday.'

'As you can see this is approximately 36.68 per cent of the total received. The balance of the monies (£1,045,095.66 - 63.32 per cent) is attributable to disbursements, including leading counsel and junior counsel’s fees.'

An earlier version of this story stated that the Al-Sweady Inquiry had collapsed. In fact, while the primary strand of the inquiry is no longer proceeding, other parts of the inquiry are proceeding as planned. We are happy to clarify this.
