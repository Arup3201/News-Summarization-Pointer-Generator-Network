Louis van Gaal has touched down in Manchester ahead of familiarising himself with his new surroundings.

The Manchester United manager touched down on a private jet in the city at 8.40 on Wednesday morning and was then whisked off to Carrington in a black Chevrolet from a private hangar.

He will be greeted by senior figures at the club's training base and given a tour of the complex ahead of getting to know his new squad.

Meeting his team: Van Gaal will be introduced to his squad at Carrington before taking training

There will be a chance to begin building relationships over lunch after he takes care of training for the very first time.

United are likely to officially unveil their boss at a press conference on Thursday.

That would represent a quick but necessary turnaround as the 62-year-old is to jet off again on Friday, this time with the rest of the first team as they play four fixtures over in America.

The former
 Bayern Munich manager believes that 'holidays are for wimps' and had no 
intention of taking time off before getting stuck into the task at hand.

Nevertheless, this will be a whirlwind couple of weeks for him after a World Cup adventure that ended in Holland finishing third. He has clocked up the miles - almost reaching 50,000km over the last five weeks - and that continues in earnest.

La Galaxy, Roma, Real Madrid and Inter Milan are the opponents across the pond, giving the Dutchman time to assess his squad ahead of what is to be a critical Premier League season after the unmitigated disaster of David Moyes' reign last year.

Van Gaal is expected to make swift decisions on individual players in order to arrest the alarming slide and welcomes Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw to his midst. 

Chris Smalling, Tom Cleverley, Javier Hernandez, Shinji Kagawa, Darren Fletcher, and Ashley Young are all waiting to see whether they will remain at Old Trafford. Robin van Persie has been given three weeks off in order to recuperate and manage niggling yet persistent knocks.
