Holidaymakers will spend nearly £1,220 on their main break next year and are planning to throw in an additional trip away from home, new research has revealed.

With the average Briton planning three trips instead of two in 2015, travellers are expected to spend nine per cent more on their main holiday compared to 2014, according to the study.

And it should come as no surprise that a typical British holiday next year will be a ten-day trip to a Spanish beach resort.

A typical British overseas holiday in 2015 will be a ten-day trip to a Spanish beach resort, a study says

The study by Travel Supermarket found that the average overseas break will involve a couple flying to Spain in June and spending a total of £1,218.52.

That includes £707.24 from their savings account to pay for flights, transport and accommodation, leaving them with £511.28 spending money.

But staycations will be most common with 32 per cent of respondents saying their main holiday will be in the UK.

For those who are heading abroad, Spain remains the most popular spot outside the UK - with 12 per cent of adults saying they plan to go there next year, down from 13 per cent in 2014.

Beach breaks remain the top holiday choice for 2015 (29 per cent), but more tourists (12 per cent) will be embarking on cultural city breaks than in recent years.

Adventure, luxury and city breaks as well as all-inclusive trips are also becoming more popular.

A third more holidaymakers (16 per cent) are looking for adventure trips compared to last year, a 12 per cent increase, with only 10 per cent planning to pay for a cottage or villa rental.

In search of comfort, 15 per cent of Brits will be treating themselves to a luxury trip (a 36 per cent increase on last year), while 17 per cent will opt for all-inclusive breaks - up 31 per cent on last year.

Holiday destinations have remained largely unchanged for the past four years with Turkey and Portugal still making the top ten despite decreasing in popularity by one per cent.

The Caribbean is the only new location to enter Travel Supermarket's list of the top destinations for 2015

The US (eight per cent), France (five per cent) and Italy (three per cent) are also on travellers' check lists as places to visit next year.

The Caribbean is the only new location to enter the top ten destinations for 2015 with two per cent planning to spend their main holiday there.

One in ten (nine per cent) are planning to holiday alone and nine per cent of adults have said they will be holidaying with parents.

Travel Supermarket's annual Travel Trends Tracker found consumer confidence is rising, with those looking to go away having three breaks instead of two - the average number of holidays since the tracker started four years ago.

More tourists (12 per cent) will be embarking on cultural city breaks than in recent years, says the study

Bob Atkinson, travel expert from Travel Supermarket, said: ‘Holiday habits are often a reflection of consumer confidence and the results of our Travel Trends Tracker indicate that the mood of the nation is becoming more positive.

‘We're seeing people starting to spend more on their main break, go away more often on holidays and even book more luxurious and costly trips.

‘While Spain continues to be a firm favourite, holidaymakers are now seeking more than just a “fly and flop” in a sunny clime, whether it's trekking in the Himalayas, bungee jumping in New Zealand, or soaking up the culture in a city like Berlin.

‘As the festive period comes to an end, now is the time for Brits to get in early to get the best deals for their 2015 holidays.

‘Looking around both on and offline and comparing your options will help you get the best value for money on a huge variety of trips, whether it's a short city break, your annual family break or something more luxurious or unusual as a treat.’
