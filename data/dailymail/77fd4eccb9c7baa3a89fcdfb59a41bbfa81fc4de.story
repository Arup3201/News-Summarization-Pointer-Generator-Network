When it comes to calling the police, most children could tell you that all it takes is to pick up the phone and dial.

But it seems the system confused one caller to West Midlands Police, who phoned the 999 emergency number to ask how to call the non-emergency 101 line.

In a recording of the call, the man can be heard asking if he needs to put the Birmingham area code 0121 before the number, or press the hash key afterwards.

West Midlands Police have released a recording of a man phoning 999 to ask how to dial 101. In the clip, he can be heard asking whether he needs to put the Birmingham area code in front of the number

On Tuesday evening the force tweeted from its @WMPolice account: 'UNBELIEVABLE - This sound clip is taken from an actual 999 call.

'In it, the man who dialed 999 asks how to call 101. Note to caller in clip... to dial our non-emergency 101 number you pick up the phone and press 1 then 0 then 1.

'Please remember that 999 should be used for genuine emergencies ONLY. For non-emegency calls and enquiries, please dial 101. Thank you.'

Yesterday Chief Superintendent Jim Andronov, head of the force’s Contact Centre, warned time-wasters that their calls could cost lives.

He added: 'Typically West Midlands Police receive over 1500 calls a day to the 999 number and our operatives have to deal with each one accordingly.

'Of these, some 10 to 20 per cent are not police matters and around 50 per cent are non-emergency calls where contact is appropriate via the 101 number.

The force released the clip yesterday  in order to shame the time-waster, saying hoax calls put lives at risk

'As well as the bizarre calls police also receive deliberate hoax calls which take up vital time. It’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth.

'Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but, if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, then a minute is a very long time to wait.

'I cannot stress enough that the 999 number is for emergencies only, for guidance this is defined as: a crime is in progress, someone suspected of a crime is nearby, when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened.

'We do not want to discourage people from contacting the police so for any other reason call 101.'

It was the latest in a string of bizarre to the 999 services across the West Midlands Police force region in recent months.

Earlier this month the force had a call from a homeowner who wanted to report a rat in her kitchen.

And last year police released a recording of a man who dialled police to complain about a prostitute's looks after meeting her outside a hotel.

The caller dialled 999 and told operators he 'wished to report her for breaching the Sale of Goods Act'.

Almost half of the 700,000 telephone calls received by the force’s emergency number were inappropriate.
