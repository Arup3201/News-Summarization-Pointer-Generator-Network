Defending champion Novak Djokovic completed the line-up for the men's quarter-finals at the BNP Paribas Open by beating John Isner in a twilight encounter.

The Serbian world number one booked a last-eight showdown with Bernard Tomic as he subdued big-serving American Isner to prevail 6-4 7-6 (7/5).

Tomic endured a harder road to the next round in Indian Wells courtesy of 18-year-old Thanasi Kokkinakis.

The Australian teenager, who had previously eliminated Juan Monaco and Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, forced a deciding set but Tomic raised his game to complete a 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 victory.

Also into the quarter-finals is experienced Czech Tomas Berdych, who came through a three-set battle against compatriot Lukas Rosol 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, and Milos Raonic, who beat Spain's Tommy Robredo 6-3, 6-2.

Awaiting the Canadian is third seed Rafael Nadal after the world No 3 eased past Gilles Simon with a 6-2, 6-4 victory.

Second seed Roger Federer - last year's beaten finalist - made it safely through to the last eight and a meeting with Berdych after dispatching American Jack Sock 6-3, 6-2 - it was the Swiss great's 50th match win at this tournament.

Andy Murray equalled Tim Henman's British career-wins record of 496 after he beat France's Adrian Mannarino in straight sets.

Murray was made to work hard for his victory against the world No 38 but came through 6-3, 6-3 in California.

The world No 4 is into the last eight for the fifth time and will now face Spain's Feliciano Lopez, who pulled off a shock 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) win against Japan's Kei Nishikori.

Simona Halep became the first player to reach the semi-finals of the women's competition as she beat Carla Suarez Navarro over three sets.

British No 1 Andy Murray also made it through into the last eight, defeating Adrian Mannarino

Serena Williams is also through, following a hard-fought victory over Timea Bacsinszky 

The Romanian lost the opening four games, rallied to level the set, but Suarez Navarro eventually clinched it with a huge forehand winner.

Third seed Halep needed only 63 more minutes to take her revenge, though, powering to a 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 triumph after finishing off with an unstoppable ace.

Serena Williams lies in wait following her hard-fought victory over the in-form Timea Bacsinszky.

The world No 1 may have needed only an hour and 25 minutes to defeat the Swiss 7-5, 6-3 but she was certainly given the runaround by a player who had previously won 15 matches in a row, claiming the Monterrey Open title in the process.
