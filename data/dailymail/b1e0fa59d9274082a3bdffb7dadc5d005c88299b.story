Waite, pictured outside Carlisle Crown Court, told police after the alleged attack that she thought she was seeing a zombie

A woman drunkenly punched her aunt in the face at a family barbecue because she thought she was a zombie, a court has heard.

Joanne Waite, of Workington, Cumbria, allegedly launched the attack on Eleanor Huddart, 69, after she 'mistook her for the living dead'.

Mrs Huddart, who was also allegedly attacked by her husband on the same evening, was left with a fractured eye socket and severe bruising after the eventful barbecue.

Waite, 44, told Carlisle Crown Court 
that she was acting in self defence when she hit her aunt across the 
face after drinking - because she didn't think she was a real person.

The
 court heard that in a statement to police following the incident, Waite
 said: 'It was walking slowly. It looked like a 1970s zombie type of 
thing.

'Is this real? Is this real? Am I really seeing someone with blood all over her face? It was walking towards me.'

She
 also allegedly claimed she 'didn't know it was a person', before adding
 that she remembered punching Huddart 'to get her off us'.

Tim
 Evans, prosecuting, told the court Waite phoned her mother during the 
bizarre incident and said: 'Ring the police mam, it's like a zombie 
mam.'

He told the jury: 'You know when you watch a horror film that Shaun of the Dead is not a fly-on-the-wall documentary.

'Did
 she get onto the police immediately? Did she wait there to await the 
arrival of the police to see what horror show was going on inside?

'Did she call Ghostbusters if it was a horrific apparition she was dealing with? No, she went home.'

Joanne Waite, 44, of Workington, Cumbria, told police she thought her aunt was a 'zombie' after allegedly launching the attack on the 69-year-old following a family barbecue in July last year

The court heard how Waite had been drinking at the family barbecue, which was held at Mrs Huddart's home in July last year, and how at the end of night the only people left were Waite and the Huddarts.

Mr Evans told the jury there was an argument at the end of the night between Mr and Mrs Huddart, which allegedly resulted in him attacking his wife.

He said the next thing Mrs Huddart could recall was waking up the next day 'black and blue' and with a fractured eye socket.

Waite was interviewed by police and Mr
 Evans said she 'concealed the fact she had struck her elderly aunt in 
the face three times'.

Waite, from Workington, Cumbria, told Carlisle Crown Court that she was acting in self defence when she allegedly hit her aunt across the face after drinking - because she 'didn't think she was a real person'

Mrs Huddart spoke to police at a later date and said things had come back to her 'in flashbacks', saying Waite had attacked her as well.

It prompted police to interview Waite again.

Mr Evans said: 'She knew that when she was punching, the person she was punching was not some zombie, it was her auntie.'

The trial continues.
