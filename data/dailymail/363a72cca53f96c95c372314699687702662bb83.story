Sir Cyril Smith has been accused of sexually abusing a 17-year-old in Parliament

Child abuser Cyril Smith groomed and abused a young activist inside the Houses of Parliament, it has been claimed.

The late Liberal MP for Rochdale has been accused of assaulting a 17-year-old-alleged victim in an office while other politicians passed by.

The victim said the assaults worsened over time and that he was groomed over a period of 18 months by Smith who died two years ago.

He claimed that the incident in Westminster was the culmination of the abuse.

He told the Telegraph: ‘There we were in Parliament 
and he was manhandling me. I was and still am deeply ashamed about what
I let him do to me.’

The accusation comes days after it was revealed that the 29-stone MP sexually abused boys at a children’s home as late as 1980.

Prosecutors missed three chances to convict Smith for indecent assault, despite the fact detectives 40 years ago were convinced he was guilty.

Simon Danczuk, the current MP for Rochdale, who spoke out about Smith two weeks ago, said the latest case indicated the MP had been abusing victims over three decades.

He said: ‘I am confident in saying, having met a number of the victims, that he went on to abuse into the 70s, 80s and even into the 90s, so he was empowered by the fact that he hadn’t been prosecuted.’

The Telegraph reported that the alleged victim, now a businessman and a father of four, was a Liberal activist and said the abuse in Westminster came after 18 months of assaults.

He met Smith aged 19 when he was in a vulnerable state having fallen out with his adoptive parents. He told Smith about it.

Missed opportunities: Both Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said if Smith, right, had been accused today he would be charged and prosecuted

He said: ‘He offered to pick me up in 
his car and took me to the moors. While he was driving and as we spoke 
to each other, his left hand moved up my leg into my groin.’

On
some days, he said Smith grabbed and assaulted him but on others 
nothing would happen when they were alone. He has reported the matter to
police.

The assault in Parliament happened after Smith invited the alleged victim down for a day.

Police have admitted that Cyril Smith should have been prosecuted

After 40 years, officers and lawyers have now agreed that Sir Cyril Smith attacked teenage boys and should have been prosecuted.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: 'The Force is now publicly acknowledging 
that young boys were victims of physical and sexual abuse committed by 
Smith.

'Three separate 
files regarding Sir Cyril Smith's actions were passed to first the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and the Crown Prosecution Service 
although on each occasion no prosecution was pursued.'

Nazir
Afzal, Chief Crown Prosecutor confirmed that a file was handed to Sir 
Norman in 1970, which contained allegations made by eight men that they 
had been subjected to indecent assaults by Smith as teenagers.

But the then Director of Public 
Prosecutions wrote back to the Lancashire Constabulary, who had passed 
on the file, advising against a prosecution.

The politician inflicted humiliating punishments on teenage boys at a 
hostel in the 1960s. 

His victims detailed how he would spank their naked bottoms and order them to strip for ‘degrading’ and unnecessary medicals.

The claims were later investigated by
police and files passed to lawyers but no case was brought against the 
former MP, who died two years ago aged 82.
