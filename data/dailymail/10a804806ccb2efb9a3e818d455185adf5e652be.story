A mother of three who was attacked by a flesh-eating bacteria that has killed others and forced them to have limbs amputated has survived the terrifying ordeal.

Debbie Woolhead, from Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, fell over on the gravel path leading to her house but thought nothing of the tiny cut, which did not even rip her jeans.

The following day, Ms Woolhead found that the cut had dramatically increased in size and was persuaded to go to hospital by her worried family.

Nightmare scenario: Debbie Woolhead thought nothing of the tiny cut she suffered after falling on her driveway - but the injury quickly developed into a huge wound

Lucky: Ms Woolhead, her daughter Amie Carver and the rest of the family are delighted she has beaten the killer disease

Doctors diagnosed a flesh-eating disease and broke the news to her family that she was unlikely to survive.

The disease, known as Necrotizing Fasciitis, has sparked panic in Georgia, where four victims have contracted it.

Aimee Copeland, 24, woke from a coma last week after a quadruple amputation while grandfather Paul Bales lost his leg after cutting it in water.

Lana Kuykendall, 36, was infected after she gave birth to twins at an Atlanta hospital and Bobby Vaughn, 32, was told doctors would need to rebuild his groin after his infection swelled to the size of a grapefruit.

Bacteria in the bug releases toxins into the skin and muscle, forcing it to waste away.

Toxic virus: Ms Woolhead spent four weeks in hospital after surgeons cut out the killer infection

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons. 

The bug may have been laying dormant in Ms Woolhead, but a scrape to her knee gave the virus a chance to spread.

Ms Woolhead, 43, said: 'I was terrified.
I had never heard of this disease and couldn't believe a tiny little 
cut nearly killed me.

'The 
attack meant my organs were affected and my lungs started failing. My 
family were called in to say goodbye because nobody thought I'd pull 
through, and I was told I could lose my leg.'

She was rushed in to surgery and despite their fears, doctors were able to save her leg and her life.

But
she was left with a shocking scar on her left leg, from her thigh to 
her knee, where surgeons had cut out the killer infection.

When she came round, her family were gathered at her bedside, including her distraught daughter Amie Carver, 21.

Ms Woolhead said: 'The first thing my daughter asked me was if I still had my leg -
I had to reach under the covers to feel if it was still there.

'It looked like a piece of meat, I was so shocked to think the small cut I'd had before could have turned into that.'

Fortunately Ms Woolhead's leg had not been amputated, but half of the skin on her leg had gone.

She would not have been so lucky if her brother-in-law, Russell Thilerow, had not insisted she seek medical attention.

Mr Thilerow, 48, visited Ms Woolhead the day after her fall last November, and saw that the wound was weeping and she was complaining her leg was throbbing.

He called an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital with a very low blood pressure and high temperature.

As soon as doctors had examined Ms Woolhead and received blood test results, she was told they were taking her to theatre and she had to give consent for her leg to be amputated if required.

Ms Woolhead spent four weeks in hospital, with vaccum pump treatment to remove fluid from her wound, and was given strong antibiotics to stop any further infection.

She has since had a number of skin grafts done on the area, and is waiting for further surgery to reduce the scar.

She said: 'I get aches from the skin grafts, and the scarred skin is very purple.

'It upsets me that I can't wear the clothes I want to, but then I realise how lucky I am to actually be alive.' 

Ms Woolhead is now able to walk, but faces several more rounds of surgery to help heal the skin on her leg

Doctors have told Ms Woolhead she was right to get to hospital as early as she did, or she might not be alive today.

Her case was the first her surgeon had seen in 20 years, and her GP had never come across the illness.

Because of the flu-like symptoms that come from having a flesh-eating disease, most people do not get help in time and it becomes too late to save their limbs, and sometimes their lives.

Ms Woolhead added: 'It's scary to think that while it was just a virus I had, it can get in so easily through a tiny open wound and be so lethal.'
