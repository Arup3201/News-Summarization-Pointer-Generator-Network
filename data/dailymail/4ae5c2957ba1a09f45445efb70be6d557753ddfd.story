From blond cornrows to a slick side parting, David Beckham has long been a source of hair inspiration for British men.

But now Beckham, and the rest of the footballing world, have stiff competition in the shape of YouTube vloggers whose hair tutorials are now being watched - and emulated - by millions.

Top of the vlogging - and hair - pops is Robin James, who boasts 37,000 followers and a quirky approach to styling.

Men are now more likely to turn to YouTube stars such as Robin James for style inspiration than footballers

David Beckham, seen here with son Romeo, was once the inspiration for most men but no longer

While his signature look, the supersized quiff he calls 'the Elephant Trunk', might look outlandish, it and others have proved a hit with men.

As a result, a new survey has revealed that one in 10 men over 25 say vloggers are their main source of style inspiration, while among teens and twenty-somethings, the numbers are even higher.

Almost one in three under-25's are avid viewers of YouTube vlogs and tune in at least twice a week, with half saying they watch the videos of their favourite stars up to 10 times a week.

While James is the most eye-catching of the new breed of hair vloggers, he is by no means the only one.

So popular are James' styles, he has amassed an impressive 37,000 regular viewers 

Andy Samuels, a friend of One Direction's Liam Payne, has also proved a source of inspiration

Samuels specialises in easy, step by step tutorials that explain how to get his signature quiff 

But as Samuels' intense concentration reveals, getting the supersized quiff right isn't always easy 

Jim Chapman is another YouTube star and is seen here explaining how to get Harry Styles' preppy look 

Chapman is one of Youtube's most groomed vloggers and includes spray tans in his repertoire 

Andy Samuels is another star who has turned his YouTube account (and close friendship with One Direction's Liam Payne) into a business.

Like James, Samuels is a fan of the oversized quiff and, along with amassing almost one million followers on Twitter, has seen his YouTube tutorial on achieving the look go viral with 10,000 views to date.

Another popular YouTuber is Jim Chapman, who along with over two million YouTube subscribers, is the boyfriend of fellow social media star Tanya Burr.

He specialises in quirky videos focused on lifestyle trends but also keeps his followers abreast of essential style tips such as how to dress like One Direction star Harry Styles.

Unlike James, Chapman doesn't confine himself to hair and indulges in everything from spray tans to armpit waxing and even the odd bit of make-up.

But Chapman has competition in the shape of 20-year-old Alfie Deyes, aka Zoella's preppily-dressed other half, who has spawned a generation of copycats. 

Deyes is the wholesome (and rather well groomed) face behind the PointlessBlog, a Youtube vlog that documents his daily doings.

This vlog about Chapman getting his armpits waxed was especially popular and got more than a million views

Alfie Deyes' preppy look and carefully spiked hair has spawned a legion of imitators

Deyes is one of the most popular of all the vloggers and boasts an incredible three million subscribers 

The PointlessBlog celebrated its fifth anniversary in July 2014 and #5YearsOfPointlessBlog trended worldwide number #1 for 9.5 hours.

As a result, Deyes' casual preppy look and carefully spiked hair has spawned a legion of imitators and is now the dominant look among teens.

Although he doesn't give style advice, his army of female fans have proved quite the inspiration for teens in search of a girlfriend.

And Deyes seems to enjoy all the attention he gets too. 'I love it,' he says of being mobbed on the street by lustful ladies. 'I just double the amount of time I would previously have allowed for the trip.'

So successful is Deyes, he has been able to persuade stars such Ariana Grande to appear in his videos
