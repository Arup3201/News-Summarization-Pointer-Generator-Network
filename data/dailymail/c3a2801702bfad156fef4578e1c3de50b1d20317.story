O.J. Simpson managed a smile and a 
waist-high wave with his shackled hand as he entered a Las Vegas courtroom Tuesday and 
found friends and family members in the audience.

Among them was Tom 
Scotto, whose wedding was the reason for Simpson's ill-fated trip to 
Las Vegas in 2007, which landed him in prison with a nine-to-33-year sentence for robbery and kidnapping.

'He looks 
like a beaten man,' Scotto said outside court after seeing his old 
friend clad in a dingy blue prison uniform and orange prison issue 
slippers, chains clanking around his feet and waist.

Argument: Simpson's lawyers are claiming that his trial lawyer for the robbery case, Yale Galanter, gave such bad trial advice and had such conflicted interests that Simpson deserves a new trial

The
65-year-old Simpson is in prison for leading 
five men in the armed robbery-kidnapping of the two sports memorabilia 
dealers.

Since Scotto's 
wedding, his marriage has collapsed and he underwent three 
emergency surgeries for life-threatening intestinal ailments.

'You don't think about it, but this has taken a toll on a lot of people,' Scotto said.

Simpson's lawyers are claiming that 
his trial lawyer for the robbery case, Yale Galanter, gave such bad trial advice and had such
conflicted interests that Simpson deserves a new trial. Simpson
claims that Galanter told him he didn't need to testify 
because prosecutors failed to prove their case, and that he didn't tell 
him about a plea offer by prosecutors that would have gotten him a 
minimum of two years in prison.

His co-counsel said Tuesday that Simpson became so dependent on Galantar during the armed robbery trial that the former football star would have done anything his lawyer advised - including passing up the chance to testify.

Defense: Simpson confers with defense team member Dustin Marcello. He is currently serving a nine-to-33-year sentence in state prison as a result of his October 2008 conviction for armed robbery and kidnapping charges

'I could advise O.J. all day long, and he was very respectful of me,' Gabriel Grasso told the court. 'But if I advised him of something different from what Yale said, he would do what Yale said.'

It was Galanter's decision not to have Simpson testify in the trial, Grasso said. The 65-year-old Simpson was later convicted and sentenced to 33 years in prison for the crime.Â

Under questioning from prosecutor H. Leon Simon, Grasso acknowledged the trial judge, Jackie Glass, specifically asked Simpson if he wanted to testify.

'O.J. did say he did not want to testify,' said Simon, Clark County's chief deputy district attorney.

'Mr. Galanter told him, `This is the way it's going to be,'' Grasso said.

He said Simpson's confidence in Galanter was born of his successful representation of the former Hall of Fame football player in a road rage case after Simpson moved to Florida following his 1995 acquittal on murder charges in the deaths of his ex-wife and her friend.

Simpson was acquitted of all the road rage charges.

Galanter, the Florida lawyer who is the 
focus of Simpson's motion claiming ineffective assistance of counsel has
declined to comment until he takes the stand Friday.

Grasso, a prominent Las Vegas criminal lawyer who signed on to help his old friend, Galanter, with Simpson's defense on robbery and kidnap charges, ended two days on the witness stand by softening his assessment of Galanter's skills.

'I feel he's a capable attorney,' he said. 'Now that I know how things turned out, this wasn't his best case.'

'Was Mr. Galanter trying to sell O.J. down the river,' asked Simon?

'No,' said Grasso.

He pointed to Galanter's cross-examination of a key witness as 'sterling' and 'awesome.'

Remember when? Simpson reacts as he is found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman in 1995

Acquit: Simpson was famously found not guilty of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend in 1995, and a pivotal point in the trial came when he put on a pair of bloody gloves that did not fit him

Galanter, who came under searing attack for his tactics during Grasso's testimony Monday, also was criticized by the lawyer who represented Simpson in a Santa Monica, Calif., case that resulted in the celebrity defendant getting back the personal items he had set out to retrieve from two collectibles dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room when he was arrested in 2007.

Attorney Ronald P. Slates testified by telephone from Los Angeles about his victory in gaining custody of Simpson's neckties and footballs.

'Did you know Yale Galanter?' asked Simpson attorney Patricia Palm.

'Yes,' he said. 'He would show up in court to take credit for what he didn't do.'

Simpson, who will be 70 before he is eligible for parole, has filed a writ of habeas corpus, his last chance under state law to prove that he was wrongly convicted and win a new trial.

After his acquittal on the murder charges, Simpson was found liable for damages in a civil wrongful death lawsuit and ordered to pay $33.5 million to the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.

Palm suggested in questioning Grasso that Glass erred at trial when she allowed prosecutors to mention Goldman in court several times even after she ruled that there would be no mention of the Los Angeles case, which was deemed irrelevant.

Nineteen separate reasons for reversal are being considered in the weeklong hearing.

Got off: The innocent verdict in his 1995 murder case came as a shock to many of the 100 million people who stopped to watch the verdict live

June 12, 1994: Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman were killed at Brown's apartment. OJ Simpson was charged with both of their murders.

June 17, 1994: Police allowed Simpson the chance to turn himself in at 11am, but he did not end up in custody until after 8pm following a multi-hour chase in a White Ford Bronco.

January 24, 1995: Opening statements for the murder trial begin, and the trial becomes a media spectacle, dubbed the 'trial of the century'.

October 3, 1995: Simpson was found not guilty on all of the counts against him. An estimated 100 million people tuned in to hear the verdict being read, and the case had such a following that then-President Bill Clinton had to be briefed on possible rioting that may break out following the verdict.

February 5, 1997: Simpson was found guilty of the wrongful death of his ex-wife and her friend in civil court, and ordered to pay $33.5million in damages.

September 1, 1999: The state of California files a tax lien against him for $1.44million due in back taxes.

February 2001: Simpson is arrested for simple battery and burglary, but acquitted on the charges in October.

December 2001: The FBI searched his residence for ecstasy and evidence of money laundering. No charges were filed.

July 4, 2002: Simpson was arrested for speeding while driving a boat in an area that was deemed a manatee protection zone. His lawyer got it talked down to a misdemeanor boating charge that resulted in a fine.

September 2007: Simpson and a group of men- two of whom had guns on them- went into a Las Vegas hotel room to confront men who were reportedly selling stolen sports memorabilia from Simpson's NFL heyday.

November 29, 2007: Though at least three of the other men present at the altercation were able to make plea bargains, that was not the case for Simpson who entered a not guilty plea.

October 3, 2008: Simpson was found guilty and sentenced to spend 33 years behind bars with the possibility of an early release after nine years.
