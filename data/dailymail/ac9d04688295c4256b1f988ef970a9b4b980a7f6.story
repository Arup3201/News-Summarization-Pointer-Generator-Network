Indian police filed the death of a five-year-old girl as a dog attack, until further investigations found she was viciously raped and murdered.

The five-year-old victim, Radhika Devi, was found with multiple injuries on July 8, near a highway in Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh, northern India.

But a postmortem examination report – demanded my family members – concluded she was viciously raped and stabbed before she died of shock and blood loss.

Justice: Rape and murder of a five-year-old girl in Lucknow, northern India is latest to expose police negligence when investigating such cases. Indian protesters came out in force in New Delhi on December 30, 2012, pictured, following the cremation of a horrific gang rape victim that shocked the world

Further protests led by poet Sankha Ghosh hit the streets of Kolkata in June to campaign against the gang-rape and murder of a college student in Kamduni village

Senior superintendent of Lucknow Police, Ravinder Goud, said: ‘We have suspended two officers for negligence and formed a special team to investigate the rape and murder of the girl.

'We are yet to find the murderers but we're working on some leads and expect a breakthrough soon.’

The little girl was from a nomadic community. She lived with her mother, Geeta Devi, 34, and two siblings after her father died three years ago. Her mother works selling grinding stones on the highway.

Geeta had reported her daughter missing to Gomtinagar Police Station when she couldn’t find her anywhere near her home on the night of July 8.

Four hours later passers-by found the little girl's dead body 500 meters away from her slum home with a pack of stray dogs nearby.

Local police concluded the girl had come out of her home to go to the toilet and was subsequently attacked by dogs and dragged 500 meters away, towards the highway.

But the family was not satisfied and was determined for the girl’s death to be investigated thoroughly.

The family claimed the police officers tried to dissuade them from ordering a post-mortem examination, which later confirmed she was brutally raped and murdered.

The report found she had 80 stab wounds, 72 of those near her genitals and eight deep wounds on her upper body.

Ashamed: An anti-rape protest in Gauhati, India, last December. The attack of the five-year-old is the latest of a string of shocking rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent months, raised serious questions across the international community over the treatment of women in the country

on fire in Etawah, the hometown of UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav

The report concluded the cause of the death was shock and excessive blood loss. They found no dog bite injuries.

Following the medical report and protests by family members and angry locals, the two senior officers were suspended for neglect of duty by local authorities.

The case is further controversy to the fear in India that local police do not take rape cases seriously.

Since a 23-year-old student was gang raped and killed on a bus in New Delhi, in December last year, people are reporting rape cases more than ever in India.

Mothers and daughters are no longer hiding away in shame, they are demanding action by their police force.

In the capital Delhi it emerged last 
week that there have been 806 cases of rape reported in just the first 
six months of this year, equalling more than four a day, compared to 706
cases recorded in all of 2012.

This latest report is one of a number of appalling rape cases that have sent shockwaves through India in recent months, raised questions across the international community over the treatment of women in the country and led to a swift overhaul of sexual assault laws.

Yesterday, a nationwide manhunt was been launched in India after four young girls were abducted from a care home in Lawada village in Pakur district and gang raped by up to 20 men.

The girls, aged between 12 and 14, were being treated in a nearby hospital after detectives said a group of armed kidnappers raided the hostel and snatched them.

Just days earlier, a 20-year-old college student was gang-raped and set on fire in Etawah, in Uttar Pradesh, the hometown of the region's Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.

In that case, shockingly, the police not only initially refused to register a case but also appeared to have abdicated their responsibility to maintain law and order.

Meanwhile, an Indian juvenile court will hand down a verdict later this month in the now infamous gang rape of a young woman on a New Delhi bus who was dumped and left to die by the side of the road last December.

The defendant was one of six people accused of tricking a young woman and her male companion into boarding an off-duty bus December 16.

Police say the men then raped and brutalized the woman and savagely beat the man before dumping them on the roadside. The woman died from her injuries two weeks later in a Singapore hospital.

Four of the defendants are being tried in a special fast-track court in New Delhi and face the death penalty. The fifth accused was found dead in his jail cell in March and the sixth, who was 17 at the time of the attack, faces a maximum sentence of three years at a reform centre. He will learn his fate on July 25.
