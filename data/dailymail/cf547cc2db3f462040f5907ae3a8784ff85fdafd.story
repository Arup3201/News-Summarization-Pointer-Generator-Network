McLaren racing director Eric Boullier is hoping the team's 'extreme' new car can rack up the miles over the remaining two tests if they are to head into the new Formula One season on a competitive footing.

Over the four days of the initial pre-season test in Jerez last week drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button completed a total of just 79 laps.

With new power-unit partner Honda on board McLaren were anticipating teething problems, and so it proved as there were numerous issues to contend with.

But there was no doom and gloom amongst the McLaren hierarchy, nor with their illustrious driver pairing, but instead positivity they are progressing in the right direction.

Boullier appreciates for the remaining two tests at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona from February 19-22 and February 26-March 1, McLaren now have to build to ensure they do not languish too far behind their rivals come the opening race in Australia on March 15.

'With a new concept and engine partner, obviously the less we run the more difficult it's going to be to catch up, or let's say, the later we will be ready to compete,' said Boullier.

'Every time we can't achieve all our targets in terms of mileage or development we push back the date where we are able to exploit 100 per cent of our car and our power unit to fight for the win.'

McLaren have pushed that development to the maximum with a tightly-packaged, streamlined rear that so far has ticked all the right boxes.

'You can see yourself the back end of the car is quite amazing,' added Boullier

'The car is very small, something we embarked on with our partner to try for such a challenge.

'We have also pushed the limit of the cooling, which means we can run hotter engines with smaller radiators and cooling system.

'All this has resulted in a tinier car, one that is very extreme in terms of how small it is.

'That is why it was a relief last week to see the car running with no cooling issues which is a concern when you go radical or extreme.'

Both Alonso and Button have already expressed confidence with the car, notably its stability under braking on entry into the corners, crucial for driver control.

The only area of concern for Boullier was seeing reigning champions Mercedes put on a virtual demonstration in Jerez as Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg completed a record 450 laps for a first test.

'What was frightening was the fact they did pit-stop training on the first day!' reflected Boullier.

'Their confidence level is very high. They had such an advantage in 2014, I don't see them failing in 2015.

'The only thing you can expect, or hope, is that everybody closes the gap.'
