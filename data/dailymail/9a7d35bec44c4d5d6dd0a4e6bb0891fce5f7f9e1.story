Giant cruise ships are set to return to Venice’s historic waterways, just months after they were banned.

A government decree that took effect in January had banned the eyesore of the behemoths passing through the canals because of the risk of damage to the ancient channels.

But the administrative court of Venice accepted an appeal by lobbyists, including the city's port, and suspended the ban because of ‘the absence of any practical alternative navigation routes’.

More than 600 cruise ships bearing 1.7million passengers passed in front of St Mark’s Church in 2012, a figure which grew seven per cent last year. Most were day trippers who barely contributed to the local economy.

The judges ruled that there was ‘not sufficient preliminary research identifying risks connected to transits of ships over 40,000 tonnes in the canals in question'.

The lifting of the ban immediately provoked outcry.

Green Party spokesman Luana Zanella said the decision 'allows the transit of real and actual floating skyscrapers exposing a city unique to the world to extremely high risk'.

She added: ‘We demand the intermediate intervention of the government with a law to limit the access of cruise ships into the lagoon. To save Venice is to save the heritage of all Italians.'

Environment minister Gian Luca Galletti said that he believed it was ‘still possible to find a solution as soon as possible to avoid the continual presence of big ships in the ancient canals of Venice.’

Venice’s proud residents have long been up in arms about the presence of large cruise ships passing through the canals

The huge ships, sometimes ten storeys high, erode the waterways and the city’s fragile foundations, contribute to the worsening flooding that occurs every winter and damage the delicate eco-systems of the lagoon.

The cruise companies pay huge port fees for the privilege, but their passengers frequently eat and sleep on board and contribute little direct revenue to restaurants and hotels.

Venice’s mayor Giorgio Orsoni wants to see cruise tourists dock at Porto Marghera, a town in the province of Venice long blighted by industrial pollution. Other suggestions have included a floating off-shore port.

Alternative solutions would see the number of cruise ships allowed to enter the lagoon severely limited, or the dredging of a new approach to the same cruise passenger terminals but avoiding the narrow canals around St Marks Square.

Tensions were raised last summer after the Carnival Sunshine, which is owned by the same parent company as the notorious Costa Concordia, allegedly passed within yards of the city’s bank while performing ‘a sail by salute’ to a major company shareholder.

Film footage appeared to show the 110,000-ton liner squeezing a vaporetto water taxi and other boats between the ship and the bank. Carnival denied any wrongdoing.

The ban on large cruise liners was accompanied by a crackdown on water traffic, after the death of a German tourist last year.

Joachim Vogel, 50, a professor of criminal law, was crushed against a dock by a reversing vaporetto water bus, as he took a tour with his family by gondola near the Rialto Bridge.

The tragic accident prompted authorities to bring in a series of new safety regulations including breathalyser tests for gondoliers and ‘a floating congestion zone’ on the Grand Canal to ease the chaotic rush hour traffic.
