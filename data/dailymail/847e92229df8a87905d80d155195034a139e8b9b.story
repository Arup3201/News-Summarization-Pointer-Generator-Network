'Catastophic' collapse: Sam Harper Brighouse, 23, who died after collapsing during the Brighton Marathon

A fit and healthy young man died following a 'catastrophic and unsurvivable' collapse as he ran a marathon, an inquest has heard.

Sam Harper Brighouse, 23, from south-east London died, fell ill around 16 miles into the race as he competed in the Brighton Marathon in East Sussex on April 14 this year.

The biology graduate had embarked on the 26-mile running challenge to raise money for the Arms Around The Child charity which supports Aids orphans.

Although he had asthma, he was 
considered fit and his respiratory problems had not contributed to his 
sudden collapse, an inquest at Brighton County Court heard.

Instead,
Mr Harper Brighouse, of Forrest Hill, died after suffering from 
ischemic bowel disease, which can cause up to 75 per cent of blood flow 
to be removed from the bowel.

Dr
Mark Taylor, consultant pathologist at Brighton's Royal Sussex County 
Hospital, said the condition is initially reversible but can progress, 
leading to fatal circumstances.

Dr
Taylor told the hearing: 'We know that up to half of people who run 
marathons develop symptoms relating to their gastro-intestines.

'They
can be minor stomach cramps, diahorrea, but on the other end of the 
scale, ischemic bowel can be exhibited in endurance exercise.'

He
added: 'When it gets to that critical stage, depending on how much of 
the bowel has died, depends on whether the person can survive.

'Unfortunately in Sam, it was catastrophic and unsurvivable.'

It
was initially thought that Mr Harper Brighouse had suffered a heart 
attack, and attempts were made at CPR as he laid in the road.

But
Mr Harper Brighouse went into cardiac arrest and his death from 
ischemic bowel, described by Brighton and Hove coroner Veronica 
Hamilton-Deeley as 'extraordinarily rare and unusual', was confirmed at 
2.30pm.

Event: Runners compete during this year's Brighton Marathon. Mr Harper Brighouse, 23, fell ill around 16 miles into the race

Dr
Taylor said: 'I think when someone collapses in a marathon, the most 
common thing to think is that they have had a heart attack.

'The
initial reaction would have been to do CPR and that was started 
rapidly. If he had been taken to hospital immediately, might it have 
made a difference? I don't think so.

'I
believe all his bowel was dead at that stage and even if (medical 
staff) thought of ischemic bowel, it wouldn't have been any help at all 
at that stage.'

Mr
Harper Brighouse probably did not notice he had ischemic bowel as its 
'non-specific' symptoms, such as pain and discomfort, may have led him 
to believe they were linked to his running.

Gastro-intestinal
problems suffered by people associated with endurance sport were being 
increasingly examined in studies, Dr Taylor added.

Attempting
to reach Mr Harper Brighouse amid the crowds of marathon runners and 
spectators was difficult, a senior South East Coast Ambulance Service 
(Secamb) staff member said.

Although Mr Harper Brighouse had asthma, he was considered fit and his respiratory problems had not contributed to his sudden collapse

The
marathon had its own medical team but Andrew Parker, Secamb's medicines
management lead and paramedic practitioner, said clearer identification
would have helped to distinguish who was who on site.

He
also told the inquest of a 'communication confusion', with marshals 
unable to tell him where Mr Harper Brighouse was as he ran for about 500
yards through the large crowds carrying equipment.

'When I asked a couple of the marshals 'Where's the incident?', they said 'I don't know'.'

As Mr Parker went on to the race track, he could see people waving at him, alerting him to Mr Harper Brighouse's position.

Mr
Parker said: 'In reality, it only took me minutes, as I did run as fast
as I could, but obviously minutes in any cardiac incident is crucial.'

He
said the problems could have been helped by having more markers along 
the race route, rather than ones that marked every mile.

Ms
Hamilton-Deeley suggested a possible solution: equipping runners with a
gas canister-activated buoy which would rise above the crowds in an 
emergency.

She said: 'This could mean that you are looking up rather through a sea of people.'

Despite the difficulties, Mr Parker praised the level of care Mr Harper Brighouse received from the medical team, saying it was to a 'high standard'.

And he did not think the access problems he encountered ultimately affected the patient. Speaking about Mr Harper Brighouse, he said: 'He had no heartbeat, no pulse and no breathing.

'From the small amount of history at the event, it was a sudden collapse. I don't think he would have known anything about it.'

The inquest is due to last until Friday.
