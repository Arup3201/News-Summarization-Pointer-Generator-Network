The daughter of jailed former Ukrainian premier Yulia Tymoshenko has urged Western nations to impose sanctions on officials involved in her mother's imprisonment.

Tymoshenko, the country's top opposition leader, is serving a seven-year prison sentence on charges of abuse of office after a trial that was condemned by the West as politically motivated and which strained Ukraine's ties to Europe and the United States.

Tymoshenko denies the charges and accuses President Viktor Yanukovych, her longtime foe, of orchestrating the trial to bar her from politics.

With Tymoshenko in jail, Ukraine's fragmented opposition forces were unable to muster a majority in parliament following an election in October, and Yanukovych's allies again control the legislature and the government.

But in an interview on Thursday, Tymoshenko's daughter Eugenia, 32, said prosecutors and judges involved in her mother's case should face Western sanctions such as travel bans and freezes on bank accounts.

'We understand that we cannot do it 
by ourselves inside Ukraine and that is why we need great international 
support, but also (an) understanding of our international friends that 
Yanukovych will not just voluntarily give up his power,' Eugenia 
Tymoshenko said in her mother's office in central Kiev.

With her trademark blonde plaits and fiery rhetoric, Yulia Tymoshenko became the glamorous heroine of Ukraine’s Orange Revolution – before being jailed by the man she ousted.

Mrs Tymoshenko became Prime Minister after the 2004 revolution to rapturous public acclaim. It seemed Ukraine was finally set to throw off the shackles of its Soviet past and embrace democracy.

Today, however, the defiant 52-year-old – who refers to her distinctive plaits as her ‘chain armour’ that ‘protects me from threats’ – has become a symbol of the repression of freedom.

Suffering from a back condition, she languishes in a shared room in a prison hospital in the city of Kharkiv (pictured above), where she is serving seven years for abusing her prime ministerial power.

Despite the fact that she cannot walk unaided, she is under constant armed guard with video and audio surveillance – testimony that she is still considered a major threat as a figurehead for Ukraine’s opposition.

Her conviction has been criticised by the European Union as politically motivated persecution and also condemned by the Danish Helsinki Committee for Human Rights.

Meanwhile, she faces further charges of tax evasion relating to her time as head of a private energy company in the Nineties and prosecutors say they have enough evidence to indict her for involvement in the murder of former Ukrainian MP Yevhen Scherban in 1996.

Her lawyers argue that the authorities want her to remain in jail for the rest of her life. 

'People like judges, like prosecutors
... they have to be put forward for sanctions. Those are the main 
executors of repression.

'Of course, there are people behind them who are in the ruling party, but it could be the first step.'

The European Union suspended a key cooperation deal with Kiev over the Yulia Tymoshenko case.

Separately, Deputy Prosecutor General Renat Kuzmin, who is in charge of the ex-premier's prosecution, recently had his long-term U.S. visa revoked. The U.S. Embassy in Kiev would not comment on the move, citing its privacy policy.

But the visa cancellation followed efforts by Kuzmin to question U.S.-based witnesses in a nearly 15-year-old murder case in Ukraine in which Kuzmin claims Yulia Tymoshenko is implicated. She denies all the accusations.

Her daughter also exhorted the 
international community to investigate and prosecute alleged instances 
of 'international corruption' involving Ukrainian officials in the West.

For instance, Yulia 
Tymoshenko has petitioned American authorities to investigate how 
Ukraine's Justice Ministry commissioned a top U.S. law firm to analyze 
her trial for what Ukraine's government says was a mere $12,000

Tymoshenko's
lawyer Serhiy Vlasenko has said that such a report must have cost well 
over $1.5 million and accused Yanukovych's allies of paying for it 
illicitly.

The report 
by the New York-based firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom 
claims that there is not sufficient evidence that Tymoshenko was 
prosecuted for political reasons, though it finds numerous flaws in her 
trial.

The law firm has not
commented on its fee for the report, which was dated September but not 
made public until earlier this month.

Yulia
Tymoshenko has been in prison for about a year and a half, but Eugenia 
Tymoshenko expressed hope that Western pressure could eventually free 
her mother so that she could run against Yanukovych in the 2015 
presidential election.

'Yanukovych's
main task was to keep my mother in prison for the elections in 2015,' 
Eugenia Tymoshenko said. 'It (takes) great responsibility and great 
power and energy to stop this train that's been going on the reverse 
side for Ukraine — away from democratic, European values.'
