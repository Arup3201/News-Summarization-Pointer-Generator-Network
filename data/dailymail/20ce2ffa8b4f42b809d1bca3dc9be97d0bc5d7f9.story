Aaron Hernandez smiled and laughed with his attorneys in court this afternoon just feet away from the crying mother of the victim as a judge ruled the trial will ignore bullets found in his apartment. 

The former New England Patriot has denied shooting to death semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of his fiancee.

And today his defense team was awarded a small success as a judge agreed to ignore the bullets found in Hernandez's rented apartment, which police claimed was the same caliber as the gun that killed Lloyd, because they had not provided a reason for a search warrant.

Waiting for the news, the 24-year-old did not seem worried as his team persisted with their arguments, and Mr Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, sat in the public gallery weeping.

Relaxed: Aaron Hernandez smiled on the third day of his evidentiary hearing at Bristol County Superior Court

Yesterday, Hernandez's defense appeared to take a blow after they claimed he was forcibly searched by police - but footage shown at Bristol County Superior Court showed the former football player relaxing on his couch. 

The defense said the search amounted to unlawful questioning, and today a judge agreed that the police failed to provide a probable reason for the warrant.

They maintain he wasn't free to leave. He has said he felt 'helpless' and worried about his family. Hernandez had earlier referred questions to his attorney. 

A trooper testified on Wednesday that Hernandez didn't seem frightened or raise concerns during the searches and said he could have left. 

Upset: She clutched her face as the judge decided bullets and a magazine found by police would be ignored

Hernandez's defense argued he was unlawfully questioned when police searched an apartment he was renting

Still smiling: His defense took a blow yesterday but the football player seemed laid back as his team spoke

Some testimony today focused on whether Hernandez was asked where his phone was.

Now, Hernandez's attorneys are asking that some of that evidence obtained by officers be tossed out in court.

A cell phone turned over by Hernandez that shows he had been in contact with Lloyd, and made plans to hang out with him close to the time he died, was obtained by the prosecution under a 'false claim of legal authority' the defense is arguing. 

Prosecutors have alleged that Hernandez and Lloyd exchanged text messages arranging a meeting on the night that Hernandez and two accomplices picked up Lloyd in Boston before driving him to North Attleboro and killing him.

According to CBS Boston, the defense claims they did not have the proper warrant to obtain the phone.

Pleaded: He has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and is calling on prosecutors to scrap some evidence

Claims: The 24-year-old insists he was left 'helpless' and worried when police searched his home

But yesterday prosecution released a video of the football player relaxed on his couch as police searched

Changes? His team want the trial moved out of Boston, where polls show most already think he is guilty

Judge Susan Garsh said earlier today she would not yet rule on the motion to suppress the cell phone evidence. 

The defense is also asking the judge for a change of venue, hoping to move the trial from Fall River, Massachusetts, to somewhere outside the Boston area.

Their reasoning includes a poll finding that most people in Bristol County already think their client is guilty of first-degree murder.

Hernandez was again in court today and, just like yesterday, seen smiling and laughing.

He is also facing murder charges in Suffolk County for the July 2012 drive-by shootings of two men outside a Boston club.
