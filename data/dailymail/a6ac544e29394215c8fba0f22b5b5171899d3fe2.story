A mother has been warned her 18-month-old daughter could be scarred for life after a scalding radiator caused horrific burns.

Lariah Daley was left screaming in agony after she placed her hand on the radiator while she played with her dolls at home. 

Her horrified mother Elisha Parker rushed her to hospital where doctors bandaged her right hand, which had swelled up to twice its normal size.

Lariah Faley suffered horrific burns after placing her hand on a radiator that was 'volcanic' in temperature, her mother Elisha Parker claims

Miss Parker, 26, said: 'The first I knew that something was wrong was when I heard Lariah crying out.

'I went to see what was going on and she had placed her hand on one of the radiators.

'I could smell burning flesh and could see her fingers were really swollen. They were a mess.

'I put my hand on the radiator to see how hot it was and it was volcanic. It was obviously faulty. The doctors say Lariah could be scarred for life.

'I just thank God it was her hand and not her face.'

Lariah was hurt at her home on the morning of August 30 when she was playing in her bedroom at the family’s new housing association flat in Nottingham.

Despite the hot weather, Miss Parker claims the radiator was automatically programmed to come on.

Miss Parker, who also has a two-year-old son Terae, is now campaigning for all housing associations to place protective guards around radiators in their properties.

She said: 'The flat is not child friendly. The radiators get extremely hot and there should be something to stop children getting hurt like this.

'If there had been a protective guard cover over the radiator, this would not have happened to Lariah.

'That is why I am so angry and I want some answers from them. I don’t think it is acceptable. 

'I could smell burning flesh and could see Lariah's fingers were really swollen,' says Miss Parker

Doctors have now warned the 18-month-old could be scarred for life after the incident last month 

'Lariah has been left in a lot of pain and she is having to go back to the hospital every couple of weeks for dressings.

'It is also not very nice for my son to see, either. We usually like to go out as a family, going swimming.

'But we are not able to do that at the moment because of Lariah’s hand.'

A spokesman for the housing association said: 'We are sorry to hear about Miss Parker’s daughter.

'Customers can control the heating in their accommodation and they are provided with instructions and given guidance on how to use the system when they first move in.

'The safety of our customers is of the utmost importance, and we requested an external contractor to complete an assessment on the radiators and heating system.

'We are reviewing the recommendations in the report as part of our ongoing investigation.'
