Sir Alex Ferguson has spoken of his anguish at the way David Moyes’s sacking was handled by Manchester United.

Speaking to an audience of 300 at a charity lunch in Manchester, Ferguson said he found it ‘upsetting the way it came out’.

Moyes learned of his imminent sacking when the story broke on Monday afternoon — 16 hours before he was officially informed by the club.

Upset: Sir Alex Ferguson is unhappy with how Manchester United dealt with the sacking of David Moyes

Sacked: David Moyes has now agreed a pay-off deal with Manchester United after being sacked on Tuesday

Ferguson clearly finds that regrettable when he was responsible for luring his fellow Scot to Old Trafford from Everton, where he had enjoyed 11 successful years prior to 10 torturous months at United.

United’s handling of the situation might cost them dearly when it comes to negotiating Moyes’s exit terms. The League Managers Association, who are assisting Moyes, have already blasted the club for behaving in an ‘unprofessional manner’.

Their chief executive Richard Bevan said: ‘The LMA is very disappointed with the nature of David’s departure.’

That view was endorsed on Thursday by West Ham manager Sam Allardyce, an LMA committee member, who called the process ‘flawed’ and ‘a great shame for David and for United’s brand’.

It is highly significant that the LMA will not comment further until Moyes’s compensation deal has been finalised.

It is understood the 50-year-old believes United delayed sacking him to save millions of pounds in compensation.

The axe fell two days after defeat at Everton, which meant United could no longer finish in the Champions League places.

Moyes has told friends he believes this was motivated by a clause in his contract stipulating that failure to finish in the top four would limit his pay-off to £4.5million — a year’s money.

Moyes is convinced United decided to sack him weeks ago — something that has been corroborated by club sources this week. But had he been dismissed when there was still a chance of finishing in the top four, his pay-off could have been at least £9m.

United maintain they did everything by the book and have adhered to stock-market regulations.

A club spokesman said: ‘We do not accept that it was handled in an unprofessional manner. The decision was not taken until late Monday night and was communicated face-to-face first thing on Tuesday morning.’

It is understood Moyes is bitter towards executive chairman Ed Woodward. He wanted daily contact with the club’s senior executive but sources say communication ‘sometimes wasn’t even weekly’.
