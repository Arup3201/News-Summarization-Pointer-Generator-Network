Former Southampton striker James Beattie has hailed the impact Saints manager Ronald Koeman and the club's recruitment, as they continue to surprise the Premier League.

Koeman has built a young, exciting squad at St Mary's that is making a big impression as Southampton remain in the hunt for Champions League football next season.

Despite selling a selection of star players last summer including Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert for a combined total of £92million, Koeman's side are currently fourth, one point behind Manchester United and one ahead of Arsenal, with only 13 games left to go in the season.

Beattie, who signed for the south coast side in 1998, making 235 appearances for Southampton and scoring 76 goals before moving to Everton in January 2005, is delighted with the club's rise.

'I think the best thing that happened last summer was that the owner Katharina Liebherr gave Ronald all that money to go and reinvest,' Beattie told Bleacher Report.

'That's a huge step. The club then recruited some fantastic, largely unknown, players because the manager knows the European market very, very well.

'Recruitment is probably 90 per cent of your success in football, employing the right people and getting them to work in the same way, whether it be the manager, the coaching staff or the players of course. 

'How the hell they got Alderweireld on loan I'll never know. It takes time to spot a player like that.'

The 36-year-old, now a manager himself having kept Accrington Stanley in League Two during his first season in charge before leaving in September, has recognised the impressive impact at Saints under Koeman since arriving in the summer.

'Outside the club, people were making assumptions, but talking to people inside Southampton, Koeman was always full of confidence and that dripped through to the squad,' added Beattie.

'I've seen 10 of the last 15 games, home and away. I speak to a few of the lads in the dressing room and they say Koeman's training is top drawer, he's personable and gets his message across.

'They are punching above their weight and it's a great thing to see.'
