Daryl Janmaat has declared his transfer to Newcastle United as the 'perfect move' following his £5million move  from Feyenoord.

The 24-year-old Holland international right-back's arrival in the North East was confirmed by Newcastle on Thursday, as was the departure of France full-back Mathieu Debuchy to Arsenal.

Janmaat underwent a medical on Tyneside earlier this week before signing a six-year contract and he will replace Debuchy as the club's first-choice right-back.

Going Dutch: Holland defender Daryl Janmaat has completed his £5m move to Newcastle

The Dutchman, who played under new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal during the World Cup, said: 'Newcastle is a fantastic club, with a big history and a great stadium. I have also been told all about how great the fans are.

'This is the perfect move for me, and I am really looking forward to being with the team and getting started here at Newcastle.

'I think we are going to have a great season.'

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew was also ecstatic after finally completing Janmaat's transfer.

Pardew said: 'We are delighted to bring Daryl to the club.

'He is the perfect example of a modern full-back: someone who is good defensively, but offers a real threat going forward as well.

'Daryl had an excellent World Cup and we are looking forward to him continuing that form for Newcastle.'

French connection: Remy Cabella joined Newcastle from Montpellier on Sunday to add to their Gallic contingent

The Magpies have now completed six summer signings already, with Janmaat following winger Remy Cabella, forward Emmanuel Riviere, midfielder Jack Colback, attacking midfielder Siem de Jong and striker Ayoze Perez to Tyneside.

Another forward is still wanted by Pardew and so further additions could be sanctioned by owner Mike Ashley.

Debuchy's £10m move to the Emirates was finally confirmed on Thursday by Newcastle as well. 

A club statement said: 'The club wishes to place on record its thanks to Mathieu for his efforts during his time at Newcastle. He leaves with all our best wishes for his future at Arsenal.'
