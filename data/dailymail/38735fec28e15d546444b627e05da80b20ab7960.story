Disguised: The home-made weapon was created from a copper pipe with a 7in metal blade at the end

This astonishing photograph shows a frightening 3ft-long sword disguised as a walking stick, which was seized by police from a hospital.

The home-made weapon was created from a copper pipe with a 7in metal blade at the end, and was part of a haul of 20 knives confiscated at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Devon.

The collection, which also included craft knives, kitchen knives and scissors, had been taken from patients and visitors or found abandoned around the hospital over the past two years.

The haul was handed over to PC Sally Cliff of Devon and Cornwall Police last weekend and will now be destroyed by the force.

She said: ‘Staff at the hospital informed us they had a selection of items found around the hospital and could I go up and seize them.

‘I seized the adapted walking stick and other bladed articles from security. At the end of the day those articles aren’t on the street, which is my main aim.’

In 2006 a similar haul collected over three years included 40 knives and sharp objects with one small knife disguised to look like a pen.

There was also an 11in blade, a knife found in a patient’s sock and drug-making equipment.

Every week almost 50,000 people pass through the hospital, which has more than 900 beds.
