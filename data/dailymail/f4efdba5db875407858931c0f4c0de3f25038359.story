When billionaire Chinese investor Wang Gongquan split with his wife and ran off with his mistress, he decided to tell the world through China's equivalent of Twitter.

But when the storm broke instead of lying low, Mr Gongquan took to the internet again, this time posting videos of himself singing about the nature of love.

In a scandal that has gripped China's high-society, the investor's penchant for social media has led to him becoming a laughing stock online.

And friends have also left messages on his Seina Weibo account urging him to get in contact after he declared his initial intentions to run away.

Mr Gongquan reportedly wrote: 'I am giving up everything and eloping with Wang Qin.

'I feel ashamed and so am leaving without saying goodbye. I kneel down and beg forgiveness!'

The Wall Street Journal also reported that the 49-year-old's confessional post was re-tweeted by 60,000 others within 24 hours.

Later his videos were seen by thousands of users and in one he stands by a lake, singing about the nature of love.

Mr Gongquan is described by Forbes as an independent director of China Digital TV Holding Co. and has directorships at other technology firms.

His use of social media to discuss intimate matters is an example of the impact that social media is having on Chinese society.

Previously, to talk of such matters was considered shameful but now an increasing proportion of China's estimated 450m internet users are taking to sites such as Seina Weibo, which has gained 140m users in just two years.

Twitter is banned in China and other sites are tightly controlled, but many people use them to make anti-government jibes out of reach of censors.
