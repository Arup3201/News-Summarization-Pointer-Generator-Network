Trolls operate out of a feeling of power, amusement, boredom and revenge and thrive on the anonymity which the internet provides, new research suggests

Boredom is behind many incidents of cyberbullying and trolling on social media sites, according to the first major study into the matter.

Linguistics expert Dr Claire Hardaker, of Lancaster University, studied almost 4,000 online cases involving claims of trolling.

She has revealed the methods most regularly used by trolls on sites such as Facebook and Twitter to trigger outrage for their own amusement.

Trolling is a phenomenon that has swept across websites in recent years where online forums, Facebook pages and newspaper comment forms are bombarded with insults, provocations or threats.

Supporters argue that it is about humour, mischief and freedom of speech, but for many the ferocity and personal nature of the abuse verges on hate speech.

Trolls operate out of a feeling of 
power, amusement, boredom and revenge and thrive on the anonymity which 
the internet provides, said Dr Hardaker.

She believes people need to be more aware of how trolls operate to counter their effect and, as a result, has identified seven tactics that trolls commonly use and why they are so effective.

They
range from deliberately digressing from a subject to focus on a more 
sensitive topic to provoke reaction to endangering others by giving 
advice, perhaps to cause harm or force others to respond to prevent 
harm. 

Dr Hardaker also 
lists other strategies such as shocking others by talking about taboo 
topics and repeatedly re-posting the same offensive messages to multiple
groups as 'deadly sins' of cyberbullies.

She
said: 'Aggression, deception and manipulation are increasingly part of 
online interaction, yet many users are unaware not only that some of 
these behaviours exist, but of how destructive and insidious they can 
be.'

She also warns that trolling can in some cases develop into more serious behaviour, including cyberharassment and cyberstalking.

Her research also reveals that trolling is not just about being directly
abusive or shocking, with more covert methods being used to wreck and 
cause havoc to online discussions.

The research is part of Dr Hardaker's wider work examining the dark side of the internet including bullying, hoaxing, grooming and online harassment.

It has been published in the latest edition of the Journal of Language, Aggression and Conflict.

Dr Hardaker is currently looking at a range of anti-social internet behaviour including cyberbullying, which has seen a rising number of schoolchildren taking their own lives.

Jessie J and Duncan James have both endured trolling and were bombarded with nasty messages on Twitter. Trolling can in some cases develop into more serious behaviour including cyberharassment and cyberstalking

She is also researching trolling and the cases of trolls mocking untimely and tragic deaths online, which are also increasing.

A number of celebrities have 
become the victims of trolls, including Blue star Duncan James, who 
recently revealed he received several homophobic messages on Twitter.

The Voice judge Jessie J has also been the subject of abuse on the social media network.

However, it is not just celebrities who are being targeted by the trolls, as discussion forums and messageboards are increasingly being hit and disrupted by cyberbullies.

Dr Hardaker said: 'The image of trolling is that it is mainly the work of young people, but the fact is trolls come from all ages and backgrounds.

'They will use different strategies to trigger the response they want from people. Some of these are a lot sneakier than others. It is not just about personal abuse.

'An incredible amount of time and strategy can be involved in trolling, as my research into the techniques they use highlights.'

Dr Hardaker believes that the aggravation typically springs from the degradation of the 'signal-to-noise' ratio.

'The time-wasting noise of one troll-post is relatively easily ignored, but the noise of hundreds of replies to the troll-post, and complaints about those replies, can entirely drown out the worthwhile content,' she said.

Digressing from the topic at 
hand, especially onto sensitive topics. Not necessarily overtly 
argumentative, this tactic frustrates its targets with its pointlessness
and circularity. Digression onto sensitive topics triggers the 
strongest reactions.

Hypocriticising,
especially for a fault that the critic then displays him/herself. A simple
tactic, often this is pedantic criticism of grammar, spelling or 
punctuation in a post which itself contains proof-reading errors to 
provoke exasperated responses from others.

Antipathising,
by taking up an alienating position by asking pseudo-naive questions, 
for example. This tactic is heavily reliant on deceiving the group it is
aimed at and covertly manipulates egos, sensitivities, morals and 
feelings of guilt, usually to trigger emotional responses. It can also 
create moral dilemmas.

Endangering
others by giving dangerous advice such as encouraging risky behaviour. A
trolling strategy designed to masquerade as help or advice while 
actually causing harm and/or forcing others to respond to prevent harm. 
It relies on the target’s social responsibility and moral obligation.

Shocking
others by being insensitive about sensitive topics or explicit about 
taboo topics. This appears to succeed mainly due to the strength of 
feeling provoked by the deeply personal and extraordinarily hurtful 
nature of the troll’s insensitivity. It triggers a desire to retaliate 
that is stronger than the desire to deny the troll the satisfaction of a
response.

Aggressing
others by insulting, threatening, or otherwise plainly attacking them 
without adequate provocation. This is open and deliberate aggression 
without any clear justification with the aim of antagonising its target 
into retaliating.

Crossposting
- sending the same offensive or provocative message to multiple groups 
then waiting for the response. The message sent by the troll in this 
tactic is totally off topic and irrelevant. This deliberately careless 
‘spamming’ tactic can result in potentially thousands of users being 
inundated with unwanted or irrelevant messages.
