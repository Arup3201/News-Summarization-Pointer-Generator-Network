Morgan Schneiderlin remains determined to leave Southampton and boss Ronald Koeman has revealed the France international is making life difficult at St Mary's.

Tottenham lead the chase for the £27m-rated central midfielder, but the South Coast club are determined to hold onto one of their key layers after a summer sale which has seen a number of their top players leave.

Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren have all departed and Saints chiefs are determined to stop the flow of talent out of the club which began when ex-boss Mauricio Pochettino joined Spurs in May.

Koeman said: 'We spoke to him this morning - the situation is difficult because the player makes it difficult.

'But the situation hasn't changed. We won't sell him. He isn't in the squad tomorrow because he says he isn't in a place to play.

'So we've given him the weekend off and Monday he has to come back.'

One piece of good news for the Dutch boss is the news defender Jose Fonte has signed a new deal with the club.

Portuguese defender Fonte, 30, has pledged his future to the St Mary's outfit and will remain until at least 2017.
