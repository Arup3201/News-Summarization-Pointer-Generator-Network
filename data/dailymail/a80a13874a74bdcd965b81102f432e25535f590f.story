Lucky: Sam Clarke, 19, miraculously survived after he was catapulted more than 100ft through the air when a lorry collided with his car - and he didn't even break a bone

A teenager miraculously survived after he was catapulted more than 100ft through the air when a lorry collided with his car - and he didn't even break a bone.

The horrific accident happened after Sam Clarke, 19, had broken down on the A46 near Cossington, Leicestershire.

After managing to pull over his Range Rover, he got out of the vehicle. But seconds later the teenager was hurled through the air after a huge 42-tonne lorry clipped the tail of his car sending it smashing into him.

Incredibly Mr Clarke, who works for British Waterways, escaped death with just two black eyes, a sore knee and bruising all over his body.

He was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary last Thursday after the crash at 8.10pm and remarkably just needed a few stitches to a gash on his head.

And just 18 hours after his car was hit by the juggernaut Mr Clarke was back on his feet and walking out of the hospital.

He said there wasn't much he could remember about the crash except standing on the passenger side of his Range Rover.

He said: 'I remember standing there and then I was pretty much knocked out straight away, I was thrown down the banking and landed in a hedge.

'I suppose it is pretty amazing that I didn't break anything, I guess the hedge softened my fall.

'My bosses have been really good to me and the doctors said it would take six weeks to heal properly but I reckon I'll be fine in three.'

His mum, Caroline Chettle, said it was a miracle Mr Clarke escaped with just a bad cut to his head, a sore knee and bruising.

She said: 'Everyone we spoke to who was involved in helping him said it was a miracle he was alive.

'We are in shock at the moment. The thought of what could have been - it's devastating. It sounds dramatic, but I want people who helped him to know we are thankful and know how lucky he was.

'He was so close to death, yet he is with us. Somehow, 18 hours after a 42-tonne lorry crashed into him and his car, he was walking out of the hospital on crutches. It is a miracle.'

Mr Clarke, from Hinckley,  Leicestershire, was driving to his girlfriend's house when his vehicle broke down.

He got out to look under the bonnet and had walked round to the passenger side of the car when the crash happened.

Mrs Chettle said: 'If he was under the bonnet at the time he would have been killed instantly.

'He remembers bits and pieces. He thinks he was unconscious for five or 10 minutes. People had seen that someone had been with the car before the crash so they were searching for him. He started shouting when he woke up and they found him.

'They were searching for other bodies because he could not make any sense - he could not tell them if anyone else had been in the car with him.

'If his girlfriend and her three-year-old girl had been in the car they could have been killed.

'The whole thing was a wreck - a total write off - the back of the car was in the front seat. I think the fact that it was a Range Rover he was driving saved his life.

'It weighs three tonne. If it had been a little car he would not have had a chance because it would have crumpled over him. But instead it took a lot of the crash.'

Relieved: Mr Clarke is pictured with his mother Caroline Cheshire

Mrs Chettle, 49, said her son was allowed home on Friday afternoon.

She said: 'We want to say thank-you to everyone who helped him.

'The people who stopped and calmed him down and tried to stop the bleeding, the ambulance, the police - everyone. The staff at the hospital did an amazing job, too.

'We don't blame the lorry driver at all. He was devastated himself. He had not seen the car in time and, when he did, he did his best to stop. It was an accident.'

Tim Coats, professor of emergency medicine at Leicester Royal Infirmary, who helped treat Sam, said: 'I am pleased that Sam was very lucky and only came away with minor injuries.'
