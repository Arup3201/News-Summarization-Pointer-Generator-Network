Nile Ranger arriving at Newcastle Crown Court today, on day four of his trial where he is facing charges of rape

Ex-Premier League footballer Nile Ranger who is accused of raping a woman in a hotel, told a jury: 'I'm nothing like Jack the Ripper'.

He made the comment in connection to the killer's name being mentioned during a series of phone messages where Ranger was trying to persuade his accuser to spend time with him, days before the alleged attack.

Newcastle Crown Court heard earlier that when the victim refused he said: 'You’re moving like I am Jack the Ripper' in which the victim replied 'Nile Ripper'.

During his evidence, Ranger told the court how he has never had sexual activity with a female against her wishes but admitted having 'quite a few' one night stands.

A transcript of the message exchanges was read through with Ranger during his evidence.

Prosecutors claim the content of the messages show the woman was not sexually interested in him and had refused his advances.

In one message the alleged victim called him a 'sex pest'.

During cross examination prosecutor Christina Egerton told Ranger: 'That's whatyou were, you were pestering her weren't you and you wanted sex didn't you?'

Ranger said: 'As well as a friendship.'

When asked whether sex or friendship was his priority in relation to the woman, he replied: 'Friendship.'

Miss Egerton asked if sex with the woman was important to him at all, Ranger replied: 'Not really but I found her attractive.'

Ranger said he would have 'taken every day as it comes' and did not want the woman purely for sex.

Now with Swindon Town, and nursing a hamstring injury which meant he sat down to give evidence at Newcastle Crown Court, Ranger denied raping the woman he had been messaging over three to four months last January, insisting they had consensual sex twice.

Mr Hedworth listed Ranger’s previous convictions which include burglary, handling stolen goods and robbery when he was a teenager growing up in north London.

His offences continued after he signed for Newcastle United and he was sentenced for drink driving in November 2011, drunk and disorderly, scuffling with two police officers on another night out, and battery when he pulled his then girlfriend’s hair last year, Mr Hedworth said.

His barrister then asked: 'Have you ever had sexual activity with a female against her wishes?'

Ranger replied: 'Never.'

The woman alleged she was raped in the Carlton Hotel, Jesmond, after agreeing to meet the footballer in a city centre bar.

She said she could not remember anything until she woke up naked in the hotel room the next morning.

Ranger told her she should take the morning after pill and she left, and they continued to swap messages that day, it was said.

She then visited her GP, was checked at hospital and made a rape allegation to police.

After Ranger was arrested, his solicitor gave police a hand-written statement in which he said they got drunk, went to the hotel and had sex twice in 'various positions', the jury heard.

In a second police interview the player revealed he paid £30 for the room, which was half-price because he was friends with the manager.

He told detectives he helped the woman get up in the road outside the hotel after she dropped her handbag, rubbed her back and comforted her.

In the interview he said: 'I’m a gentleman yer kna (you know), I’m rubbing her back, making sure she’s all right, holding her.'

The next morning Ranger took a photograph of the hotel sheets with the room key on the bed, but he deleted the image after he was arrested, the court heard.

Asked by Mr Hedworth how he now felt about taking the picture, he told the court: 'It was wrong, but at the time I was not thinking.'

Asked why he took it, Ranger replied: 'I haven’t a clue, to be honest.'

Mr Hedworth asked why he deleted the picture of the sheets, which experts were able to retrieve.

Ranger replied: 'I knew the picture was wrong. I knew it did not look right.'

He said the rape arrest was a factor in his contract ending on Tyneside.

'To be honest, with Newcastle I was getting in a bit of bother, lateness and stuff' he said.

'It was like a ticking time-bomb with the whole rape allegation. It affected me.'

On the day of his arrest he was packing to move on loan to Hull City - then third in the Championship and chasing promotion to the Premier League, he said.

'I was getting no love or first-team action with Newcastle,' he said. 'I was literally packing my things on the day of my arrest.

'Once I got arrested, the next day it was all over the press.'

Ranger told the jury the loan move to Hull fell through.

'With football and a lot of things, it put a pause on a lot of things,' he said.

His contract at Newcastle United was terminated in due course, the jury heard. Since then he has signed for Swindon Town and started scoring goals again until injury struck.

The court heard how the phone also contained photographs of the woman dancing from the night of the alleged attack and a selfie of the two of them together.

In a police statement following his arrest Nile Ranger said: 'The victim and I entered the room together. By this stage we had been drinking alcohol for about three hours.

'We were drunk but aware of our actions. For the next three hours the victim and I had consensual sex.

'We had sex in various positions including her being on top of me and then slept together and she left at approximately 10am. She has since sent messages from her phone referring to our night out together.'

Ranger also told police in his interview how he told the taxi driver to take them to a hotel and the victim was cool with it.

He said: 'She didn’t say take me home, she said cool.'

Christine Egerton, prosecuting, told the jury how the alleged victim had visited the GP for emergency contraception the following morning before visiting the emergency department at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle.

The woman then reported Ranger to the police station the following day and he was arrested at his home in Forest Hall.

No alcohol or drugs were found in the victim’s system by the time the tests were carried out by police.

The trial continues.
