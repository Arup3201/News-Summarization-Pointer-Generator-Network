An 8-year-old girl has recalled the painful and terrifying moment a dolphin lunged out of the water at a SeaWorld park and latched onto her hand, half pulling her back into the tank with it.

Jillian Thomas of Alpharetta, Georgia said she was feeding the dolphins in Orlando, Florida and raised the paper carton she was holding 'when the dolphin saw that, it leaped at me and bit me, ate the carton.'

'It really, really hurt,' Jillian said in an interview on Monday with ABC's 'Good Morning America' where she showed her nearly healed injuries.

Dolphin wounds: Jillian suffered three puncture wounds and a swollen left hand after the unexpected biting occurred

Seemingly safe: Jillian Thomas, 8, and her younger brother James were feeding the dolphins at Orlando SeaWorld last month when the incident occurred

Jillian suffered three puncture wounds to her hand. Her father Jamie Thomas, who was with her at the theme park when the dolphin lunged from its pool on November 21, described his reaction as: 'Instant fear.'

'I thought that, wow, I may have to lunge at the dolphin, and pull her or, get physically involved,' he recounted of all the thoughts swirling in his head.

After pulling his daughter away from the pool, it was then a Sea World employee asked if they needed help.

'They asked if she wanted first aid, and I said "she's bleeding" so yes, we want first aid,' he recalled.

Jillian held two dolphin stuffed animals as she recounted the ordeal, saying she hoped the dolphin didn't get sick from eating the paper carton. She's prayed for the animal at night.

While dolphins are known for their playful behaviour and permanently painted smiles, they are also known for their sheer physical power and sharp teeth which have led to attacks on humans.

Human feeding is linked behind many reported attacks though other incidents have been seen during moments of sexual aggression.

Federal officials say dolphins are of little threat to people in captive swim programs - with in 1994 less than 1 out of 10,000 people injured - but those animals in the wild are far more spontaneous and unpredictable in their behaviour.

Earlier this year in Louisiana a single wild dolphin was reported terrorizing residents in a waterside community in Slidell where it bit three people in June.

In one incident a boater's hand was sliced open by the dolphin's teeth while he stuck his hand in the water to clean it. In another case a girl was dragged into the water by her ankle.

Other reports described the dolphin as head butting and chasing acquaintances.

Like many other incidents, officials in Louisiana said there were related reports of people feeding the dolphin and attempting to lure it out with food potentially leading to its association of all humans having food.

'Twice,' her mother said.

The paper cartons are used to hold fish children and others feed the dolphins.

Jillian's parents say park-goers may not realize the risk involved in feeding dolphins, which is why they posted video of the bite to YouTube, so parents can decide for themselves whether it is safe.

Mr Thomas' daughter’s cuts are healing, he 
said, but he and his wife are upset with the way SeaWorld employees 
handled the incident, saying they trivialized the severity of it.

SeaWorld officials said in a statement that the safety of their guests is paramount, and they are taking the situation seriously.

'Educators and animal care staff are always on-site at this area, monitoring all interactions and are committed to guest safety,' SeaWorld said in the statement.

'Educators and animal care staff were at the attraction when this happened and immediately connected with the family,' SeaWorld said. 'In addition, a member of our health services team was in the area at Dolphin Cove and quickly responded and treated the young girl.'

‘Thank God it didn’t pull her in the 
water. It’s only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured 
at this attraction,’ Thomas wrote in a message at the end of his video.

This isn’t the first dolphin bite the park has seen.

In
 2006, two adults pried open a dolphin's mouth to free a 7-year-old boy 
from its grip, which left a bruise on the boy’s hand, according to 
another Orlando Sentinel article.

Setting an example: Appearing on Good Morning America on Monday, the girl's parents said they posted the video to show the dangers of hand feeding dolphins but don't plan to take legal action

Not the first time: SeaWorld has had trouble with its dolphins biting young visitors in the past

SeaWorld spokesperson Becca Bides at the time told the Sentinel that no changes were being planned for the attraction.

Jullian’s mother, Amy Thomas, said she would have been more careful if she had known her daughter might get bitten.

‘I felt safe,’ she said. ‘Everyone 
just imagines dolphins as smiling, non-biting animals with knobby teeth.
 You forget these are wild animals.’

The
 Thomas family said they do not plan to take legal action against the 
Orlando-based theme park, but said they would like Sea World to increase
 the age limit for children feeding dolphins and remind parents that 
dolphins aren’t always as friendly as they look.

SeaWorld did not return requests for comment from MailOnline.
