Luke Hunt, the fiancé of Indigenous model Samantha Harris could face up to ten years in jail for causing the death of an elderly man after he ran a red light at 40 km/h over the speed limit, a court heard.

The 28-year-old is currently facing a sentencing hearing for the incident, which occurred two years ago when he and Ms Harris, 23, were driving to the gym in Narweena in Sydney's northern suburbs.

The Commodore he was driving collided with a Hyundai Lantra driven by Kennth Lay, 78, at the  intersection of Alred St and Warringah Rd.

Luke Hunt is facing a maximum 10-year jail term for dangerous driving, which occasioned Kenneth Lay's death. He is pictured with his fiancee, model Samantha Harris

The beauty has been modeling since she was discovered in a competition held by Girlfriend magazine when she was 13-years-old

Mr Lay, who had 16 grandchildren, later died in hospital from injuries sustained during the collision.

Hunt, a builder from Queensland, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving saying he ran a red or orange light. He claims he was travelling at 94 km/h in a 60 km/h zone. However, the crown told the court  he was driving at 101 to 105 km/h.

The question of the speed at which Hunt was travelling needs to be resolved before the judge sentences Hunt later today, though he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison.

Hunt was driving at least 30 km/h over the speed limit and ran a red or amber light at an intersection when his car collided with the car driven by Mr Lay

The model is engaged to her boyfriend of six years, who's a builder from Queensland

Harris was a passenger in the car during the accident in Narraweena

The Daily Telegraph reported the judge told the court 'there are no winners in this case' as the families of both Mr Lay and Hunt, including Mr Lay's emotional daughter Christine Scott, filled the court room, sitting on opposite sides.

Ms Harris was not present at Sydney's District Court for the sentencing hearing.

Hunt and Ms Harris, who shot to national fame in a modelling competition held by Girlfriend magazine when she was 14, met in a shopping centre on the Gold Coast when the model was 17. They have been engaged for four years.

The collision took place at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St in Narweena, in Sydney's northern suburbs, two years ago. Mr Lay, who had 16 grandchildren, was taken to hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the crash
