One week after TMZ broke the story that a neighbour had made a sworn deposition that a 'glass crack pipe' was found following the fire that broke out in actress Ashley Greene's West Hollywood apartment last year, the Sheriff's investigators have debunked the claim.

Building manager Adrian Mayorga is among several residents suing the Twilight star - citing respiratory damage - after her unit went up in a flames on March 22, 2013, which was originally said to have been caused by an unattended lit candle.

But while Mayorga insists in his sworn statement that he was told by one of the men involved in the cleanup that a glass crack pipe had been found in the apartment, a report obtained by TMZ on Sunday that was filed by the Sheriff's Arson/Explosives Unit shows no such finding.

Claim debunked: One week after Ashley Greene's former building manager claimed a 'glass crack pipe' was found following the fire that broke out in her West Hollywood apartment in March last year, a report filed by the Sheriff's Arson/Explosives Unit has dismissed the claim

According to the website, this could mean one of two things: that no such pipe exists or that it was simply missed in their filing.

The documents also reportedly state that there was no evidence of arson and they do not rule out the cause as accidental.

In initial reportings of the incident, Greene, her boyfriend at the time - alleged to be actor Ryan Phillippe - and her brother were said to have been sleeping in the apartment on March 22 when an unattended candle set a living room couch ablaze.

Despite Mayorga's version of events, a source was quick to dispute his claim, telling Us Weekly that no crack pipe was found at the scene.

'It's all hearsay from unnamed sources - Mayorga's claiming he heard from a friend of an unidentified worker who may have entered the apartment,' said the insider.  

The blaze tore through Green's entire apartment and killed one of her two fox terrier dogs.

Mayorga said in his deposition, obtained by TMZ, that he was the first person in the hallway after the fire broke out, and claimed he saw Greene and her companions looking 'disoriented' as they fled the apartment.

He added: 'The only people I saw getting treated was Ashley Greene, her brother Joe Green, and her - the current boyfriend, Ryan Phillippe.'

But sources tell TMZ that Phillippe submitted a sworn declaration to Greene's lawyer this week insisting he wasn't in the apartment when the fire broke out and had in fact never even visited the unit. 

Mayorga claimed in court documents filed last year that he was hurt while running through smoky hallways of the apartment building yelling for residents to flee.

He alleged that he suffered exhaustion, dehydration and smoke inhalation and also was hospitalised, according to TMZ.

Greene also has been sued by four residents in neighbouring units who claim the fire caused soot and water damage.

Sources also tell the website that actor Ryan Phillippe - Greene's alleged boyfriend at the time - has denied claims he was present the night of the fire, the actor pictured earlier this month in NYC

Meanwhile, the apartment was finally sold in July for $1.1 million following some serious renovations costing $303,000, according to TMZ.

TMZ reports that the building HOA’s insurance covered a complete remodel of the 1,800 sq ft apartment to help shift it, although by law the new residents had to be made aware of the incident.
