She is regularly spotted picking up a coffee from Starbucks or stopping off for a treat at McDonalds.

And while she clearly loves a bargain when it comes to clothes and food, Britney Spears managed to spend a whopping $7million last year on one too many good deals.

According to TMZ the star spent around half of her $14million conservatorship back in 2012 on a wide range of items varying from the thrifty, such as a Subway sandwich,  to the extravagant - $3,400 on Christmas lights.

She loves a deal: Britney managed to spend nearly $7million last year on a number of bargains

Documents obtained by the website show she spent a total of $6.8million, which included $63.74 at a 99 Cents Plus, $11.92 at Pay 99 Cents Or Less and various receipts from a range of her favourite food chains, including Domino’s, El Pollo Loco, McDonalds and In-N-Out.

It wasn’t all just spent on food though - it’s reported she spent $33,959 on grooming and wardrobe, which is in fact a small budget for most stars in the public eye.

It doesn’t however come as much a surprise considering just this week Britney was spotted wearing a top she wore the week before – showing that fashion really isn’t a priority for her.

While much of what the 31-year-old spent her hard-earned cash on was cheap food, she also splashed out on a few extravagant items. 

TMZ reports she spent $500 on a manicure and $1,500 went to Casey Alridge – the father of her sister Jamie Lynn’s child. 

The documents also reveal the singer's worth and shows that the conservatorship alone has $36.4million which at this stage doesn’t include her net worth – which includes the $68million she made on her last tour and $15million she received for her role on the X Factor.

Britney’s father, Jamie, has been conservator of her affairs for almost five years after her life spiralled out of control in 2007. 

A judge handed Mr Spears control of the singer's fortune and almost every other aspect of her life after she had a public meltdown.

At the height of her problems Britney lost custody of her children, Sean Preston and Jayden James for a long spell which prompted an infamous rant outside Kevin Federline's LA home, resulting in a shaven-headed Britney rampaging with an umbrella.

In January of last year it was reported that her father was considering halting the conservatorship as a special gift to celebrate her upcoming wedding to Jason Trawick.

Unfortunately the couple never made it down the aisle and Britney never regained control of her money.

Long list: A 150-page document, filed at Los Angeles Superior Court on Aug. 9, shows that her conservatorship earned almost $14 million - and she spent $6.8 million

Expenditures: Some of Britney's expenses came at hefty cost - she spent nearly $31k on her wardrobe and nearly $40k on cleaning services
