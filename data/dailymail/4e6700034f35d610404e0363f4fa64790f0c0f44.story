Singing in front of the team is now a rite of passage for any new player, but you wouldn't have seen Roy Keane belting out a tune in his heyday

The Manchester United legend also revealed he turned down the chance to appear on Celebrity Big Brother and I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here.

Speaking to ShortList magazine, Keane revealed he doesn't like the tradition of player initiations, but gave fans a tease of must-watch TV that could have been.

Roy Keane, on the bench as assistant manager of Aston Villa, has slammed the modern initiation of singing

'It happens now at Villa, but if I was a player at a new club and someone said, “You’ve got to sing tonight,” I just f****** wouldn’t do it,' said Keane.

'I sing for nobody. People say it’s banter, but I don’t like that type of banter.

'I’d help players by making sure they settled in properly, making sure my wife touched base with their family. That was my way.'

Keane, in his heyday for Manchester United against rivals Arsenal, would refuse to sing for his team-mates

The Irishman, sharing a joke before kick-off on Monday at QPR, has turned down offers to appear on reality TV

And while Keane can't see himself following in the footsteps of Vinnie Jones and Eric Cantona by embarking on an acting career, the Irishman did reveal he turned down the chance to appear in the Big Brother house and in the jungle on 'I'm a Celebrity...'.

'I am more open to stuff now. I’ve had the Celebrity Big Brother offers and the jungle stuff.

'I met the jungle people, but I thought, “Nah, not for me.” But the more you say no, the more determined they are to get you, so who knows? There’s more to life than football.'
