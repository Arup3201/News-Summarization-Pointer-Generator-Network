Everton defender Bryan Oviedo is ready to make his return from an horrific double leg break in Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie at Swansea.

The Costa Rica international suffered the injury against Stevenage in an FA Cup fourth round game in January and was forced to miss the World Cup.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez said: 'The really good news is that Bryan Oviedo is in the squad for the first time since breaking his leg.'

Striker Aroune Kone could also play at the Liberty Stadium following an 11-month layoff with a knee injury, but Seamus Coleman and Steven Pienaar are definitely out.

Everton are looking to bounce back from Sunday's 3-2 home Barclays Premier League defeat to Crystal Palace.

The result means that, ahead of Saturday's derby trip to Liverpool, the Toffees have conceded 13 goals in the opening five games of their league campaign, the worst defensive record in the division.

But Martinez insists there is no problem with his players' attitude towards defending.

'We had two very good performances defensively (a 4-1 Europa League home victory over Wolfsburg and 2-0 Premier League win at West Brom) previous to that (the Palace match), so it is not that there is a problem that has been developing,' Martinez said.

'I do think that the performance and clean sheet against West Brom brought our defensive intensity back to our play.

'I think it was back against Wolfsburg as well, and yesterday was just a bit different.

'Unfortunately we made a couple of bad decisions and errors which cost us goals. But I don't think it's the case of a lack of a defensive attitude of the team.

'It was a very rare game. The spooky side of it was that we replicated against Crystal Palace the performance we had in April, with the same scoreline. But we will learn from it.'

Martinez once again dismissed the idea that his side had any kind of Europa League hangover following their clash with Wolfsburg on Thursday.

He said: 'No, it wasn't that. If it had been that we couldn't find our rhythm or our normal way of playing because we were tired or didn't have the energy, I would say that was down to the fact we played an extra game on Thursday.

'But that wasn't the case at all - if anything, it was the opposite. If you watched the first 15 or 20 minutes, we were the ones with the real intent on the ball. We looked fresh and were penetrating.

'All in all, I felt the players who came in were ready.'
