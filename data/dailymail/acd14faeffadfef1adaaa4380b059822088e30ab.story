A teacher accused of sexually assaulting a student more than 50 times has been arrested after turning herself in.

Carrie Miller, 24, is accused of sexual assault and enticement through electronic devices for allegedly having sexual contact with a then-15-year-old boy in the fall of 2012.

Miller, a Spanish teacher at Johnson County Central High School from Tecumseh, was married at the time of the assaults.

Turned herself in: Carrie Miller, 24, a Johnson County Central Spanish Teacher accused of sexually assaulting a 15 year student, was in Johnson County Court Wednesday

According to court documents, Miller had sexual contact with the boy between 50 and 60 times during the fall of 2012.

She was arrested Tuesday and went before a judge Wednesday, who set her bail at $25,000.

The probable cause affidavit says the two routinely exchanged text messages, graphic photographs and inappropriate conversations.

The alleged encounters were usually arranged by cell phone and took place in both Johnson County and an abandoned farmhouse in neighboring Nemaha County, where she will also face charges.

Career: Miller taught Spanish at Johnson County Central High School at the time of the assaults

Miller was married to a Lincoln man in September 2011 and the couple filed for divorce in February 2013.

According to ABC 8, the information that led to Miller's arrest was provided by a tipster.

Deputy Johnson County Attorney Rick Smith said accusations of this nature rarely happen in the area. 'This is the first time I've heard of it in my 32 years,' he said.

Local parents were shocked at the allegations.

Married: Miller had only been married a year when the alleged assaults occurred

Grandparent Pat McKinney whose children and now grandchildren attend the school said her reaction was 'Shock, just shock.'

'Children at this age are easily manipulated,' McKinney told 1011, 'and easily led into doing something.'

McKinney and another parent, Carolyn Justus, said that they had heard nothing from the school about the incident and only found out about Miller's arrest through the media.

The school has not commented on Miller's arrest, saying only that the school is dealing with a 'personnel' issue.

Miller's next court date is February 26.
