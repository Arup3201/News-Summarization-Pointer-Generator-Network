Jeremy Forrest’s victim has been given permission to visit him in prison. Forrest’s sister Carrie revealed: ‘The girl’s been told that she can visit him.

'She’s planning on doing that as soon as she can. Jeremy told me that he’d been told that she wanted to visit.

‘In court on the day of his conviction, he said to me, ‘‘Tell her she’s allowed to visit,’’ and when I did she just smiled.’

The revelation came as it emerged that more than 100 people have illegally named the girl on social networking websites.

Last night, The Mail on Sunday identified more than 120 posts on Facebook and Twitter that breach the lifelong anonymity given to victims of sexual offences.

The girl – just 15 when she fled to France with Forrest – is also subject to court-imposed anonymity as a minor.

However, following the teacher’s conviction on Thursday, many people commenting on the case online chose to defy the law and openly disclose the victim’s identity.

Media lawyer David Banks said this was a criminal offence, adding he would not be surprised if the offenders ‘have the police knocking on their door’.

He said: ‘They are taking a great risk. If the Crown Prosecution Service takes the view that this might put off future victims from coming forward, they may well decide to make this a police matter.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
