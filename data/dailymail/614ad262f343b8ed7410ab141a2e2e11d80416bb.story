Ben Davies has admitted that he was 'comfortable' during his time at Swansea City and that his move to Tottenham Hotspur has toughened him up.

The 21-year-old left family and friends behind in Wales when he completed his £10million move to White Hart Lane. 

Davies, who has been vying for the left back spot with Danny Rose, says that the task he faces at Tottenham is much more demanding than what he faced in Wales.

Ben Davies says his move to Tottenham 'toughened' him up as he found old club Swansea 'comfortable'

Speaking to the London Evening Standard, he said: 'With the whole transition of coming away from my home-town club, I think I've had to get a good boost of ­self-­confidence and that's an important part of being at Tottenham.

'You have to be confident in yourself. Perhaps 'self-confidence' isn't exactly the right word but coming away from home toughens you up a bit.

I'm only 21, an age when a lot of people are still living at home, I was comfortable at Swansea but I wanted the new challenge.'

Davies is looking forward to tonight's match at Bramall Lane and says the game will be a 'battle' 

The left back says that despite the intense competition for places, he's learning a lot from the players around him.

He said: 'I'm not here to blow my own trumpet but I do think I've improved as a player since I came to Tottenham. 

You learn from the players around you. People like Danny Rose and Jan ­Vertonghen, I've picked up a lot off those guys.'

Davies and his teammates face Sheffield United tonight in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg, and the Welshman is excited about the clash at Bramall Lane.

He added: 'There are a lot of players from across the world in this squad but the doggedness we British players tend to have can be a big help for us. 

It's nice that this game against Sheffield United might have 'the battle' about it.'
