A brother and sister have been reunited for the first time in six decades after they were separated as young children.

Allan Healy spent years looking for his long-lost sibling Margaret Mitchell - but was only able to track her down thanks to Facebook.

After the pair were reunited, Mr Healy was delighted to discover that his mother is still alive, and still remembers him despite suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

Mr Healy and Mrs Mitchell grew up with their parents and brother Stewart in Dundee, but after their parents split up in 1954 the family was divided.

Their father John took the boys to Plymouth, where he was originally from, while their mother Elizabeth stayed with her daughter in Scotland.

In later life Allan, 66, joined the Army, while devoting years to trying to find his sister - without any luck.

'I scoured birth and marriage certificates, and other records, to try and find my sister,' he said.

'My search took me to Scotland, where I at first drew a blank because of the different system with data protection.

'Then I thought about Facebook and a cousin sent me a photograph of Stewart, Margaret and myself taken when we were children.

'I made it my Facebook profile picture and put out a message for anyone who might know Margaret Healy to get in touch.'

Mrs Mitchell, 67, was also using the site to try to find her brother - and when a friend stumbled across Mr Healy's photograph she realised it must be him.

'My neighbour Kathie McGill is interested in family history and she helped me by putting out a message for an Allan Healy, who I thought might still be in Plymouth,' she said.

'Then Kathie came through and said there was a photograph on Facebook with a young Allan Healy and a girl with him - and I was the girl. I was amazed.'

After discovering the picture, the brother and sister had a tear-filled telephone conversation, and Mr Healy travelled to Dundee for a family reunion.

He said: 'I got out of the car, looked over and saw Margaret standing there. I ran over and we hugged and cried. We couldn't believe that we were together again.'

They went to visit their mother, now 88, in the Dundee care home where she lives - though Mr Healy assumed that she must have died years earlier.

Mrs Mitchell said: 'When I spoke with him on the phone I was struggling for things to say at first. But I ended up speaking about Mum and he was so shocked to hear she was still alive.

'He just couldn't believe it and burst into tears when I told him. We went to visit her and even though she has Alzheimer's she still recognised him and held our hands together.'

She added: 'I said, "Hello Mum, I've brought Allan to see you." She looked up and put my hand on his hand and her hand on top and said, "We're all together again now."'

Their father, now 90, worked as a cooper in Plymouth, where he married his second wife. 

Mrs Mitchell is now planning to visit her brother at his home in Margate, Kent.

'He's been searching for me for years but I have to say that I never thought I'd see him again,' she said.

'I don't understand about all these modern Facebook things so I was just amazed that we managed to find him.'
