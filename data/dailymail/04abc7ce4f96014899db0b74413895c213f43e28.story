Tim Sherwood is a man who likes a challenge. He must be some sort of Superhero.

Skipper little Blackburn Rovers to the Premier League title? Captain Fantas-Tim did it.

Get an 18-month deal out of Daniel Levy knowing there is no chance you’ll see more than one-third of it through? SuperTim sorted it.

Tim Sherwood will need to have superhuman abilities to restore the glory years at Aston Villa

Sherwood faces a relegation struggle but Villa's FA Cup progress is something to cling on to

Get a decent game out of Emmanuel Adebayor? The Sher-manator managed it.

Salute a footballer in front of thousands of people but somehow keep your reputation intact? Sher-Wolverine did it. Kind of.

Instead of a cape, he wears a gilet.

But succeeding at this latest challenge for Tim will be like achieving the impossible. Managing Aston Villa has now become the job nobody can do.

He has an owner with a much-reduced level of interest to match the much-reduced budget. But at the same time he has a set of fans who understandably but unrealistically demand good football, success and a challenge towards the top end of the table. They expect to be in the top six, not the bottom three.

We’ll never know if Paul Lambert was destined to take Villa down, but he had lost his way. Bringing in Roy Keane, who subsequently upset some players, almost certainly changed the squad’s view of Lambert, and precipitated his departure.

Sherwood needs to keep players onside – it will be interesting to see if he does that: remember his blast at Tottenham players after their defeat at Chelsea? He needs to get Villa playing a bit of football, scoring goals and in the short term, keep them up.

If he’s confident of doing that then he should absolutely go all out to win the FA Cup. If he does that then that creates a bit of history nobody can ever take away from him.

And Villa fans love a bit of history.

A trip to Villa Park will leave you in no doubt this is a big club. Reminders of the title win in 1981 and the European Cup win the year after are everywhere – as they should be.

Paul Lambert was sacked as Villa manager on February 11 after nearly three years in charge

Lambert's decision to bring in Roy Keane as his assistant caused more divisions in the squad

But times are tough right now, and the recent memory of their inferior city rivals Birmingham even managing to win a trophy at Wembley makes the taste of failure even worse.

Aston Villa don’t get enough credit for that 1982 European glory. They’re the English success story from that era that fell down the back of the sofa while everyone was too busy listening to the great Brian Clough deliver endless soundbites at Forest or watching the glorious Liverpool side.

Somehow they kept the goal machines of Bayern Munich – they’d scored seven in the semi-final – quiet. The tournament’s top three scorers – Dieter Hoeness, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner - all drew a blank that night in Rotterdam, against a rookie keeper in Nigel Spink, on for the injured Jimmy Rimmer after just nine minutes.

Those glories are light years away of course.

But bear this in mind: title-winning manager Ron Saunders left in February 1982, and Tony Barton took over with the club already into the quarter-finals of the European Cup which they went on to win.

Paul Lambert has just gone – it’s February. And Tim Sherwood takes over with the club already into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup.

It’s not quite that great Villa side of 1982 with the leadership of Dennis Mortimer, the vision of Gordon Cowans, the goals of Gary Shaw and Peter Withe, and the wing wizardry of Tony Morley. 

But it might possibly be some sort of omen for Villa fans to cling on to. They’re so desperate right now they’ll cling on to any sort of hope they can find.

Can Tim Sherwood boldly go on mission impossible once again? Or will his gilet self-destruct in five seconds? 

We salute you Tim for stepping up to the Villa plate and trying to become football’s own comic book hero – take Villa back to the big time and you’ll be better than SuperMan. In fact you’ll become SuperManager.

Just don’t appoint Roy “Kryptonite” Keane as your assistant.
