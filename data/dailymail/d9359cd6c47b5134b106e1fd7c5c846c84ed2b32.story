It was this close.

Tragedy almost struck at the Washington Nationals game on Sunday, as a little girl ran in front of the pitching mound and was almost hit by Stephen Strasburg.

The hard-throwing pitcher was warming up before the San Francisco Giants game when a a tiny blonde child in Nationals gear dashed across the field right in front of where he was about to throw.

It was a narrow call — but Strasburg stopped himself at the last second and let the girl pass.

The Nationals pitcher averaged 97 mph per pitch in the 2012 season, according to Sports Illustrated. Strasburg's fastballs have reached 102 mph.

The girl is believed to be one of the few fans chosen to walk the field before games.

She took a wrong turn off the field and started to run across once she realized that was not the way out.

Her frantic father ran across the field after her, gesturing wildly as if to say 'Get over here!'

Catcher Jose Lotabon and second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera put their hands up to warn Strasburg, according to Yahoo Sports.

The National won against the Giants, 14-6.

Strasburg pitched just four innings and gave up five earned runs.
