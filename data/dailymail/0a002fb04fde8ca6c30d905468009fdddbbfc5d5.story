Hope: The Queen has spoken about Prince George in her Christmas broadcast, and said the birth of a baby allows people to think about the future with renewed 'happiness and hope'

'We all need to get the balance right between action and reflection,' she says in the speech that was recorded earlier this month.

Dressed in the canary yellow gown she wore to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011, Her Majesty tells viewers: 'With so many distractions, it's easy to forget to pause and take stock.' 

Her Majesty wears the diamond, ruby and 
sapphire brooch that was given to her by her parents to celebrate the birth of 
Prince Charles in 1948, for the message which is delivered in front of a glistening Christmas tree.
