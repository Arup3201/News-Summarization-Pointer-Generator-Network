A cheeky mink fancied some fast food – so it dived into a fisherman’s bucket and made off with his catch.

The mink was caught on camera plundering the bucket and carrying away the live catfish – which is bigger and heavier than him.

‘Oh my god he’s got it, wait, it’s too heavy,’ said one onlooker watching the fight between fish and mink.

The mink scrambles out of the bucket and onto the concrete as if to reassess the situation, taking a running jump and diving back into the bucket for a second round with the fish.

It takes the furry beast three attempts to hoist the fish out of the bucket and onto dry land, where it lies flapping its tail helplessly.

The mink then drags the fish away and into a hole in some nearby rocks on a pier on Lake Ontario in Webster, New York.
