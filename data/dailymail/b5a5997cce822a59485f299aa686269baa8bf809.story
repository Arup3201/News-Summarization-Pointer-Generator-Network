Ed Miliband says he wants ordinary voters to be able to take part in their own version of Prime Minister’s Questions to reinvigorate British politics

The public could be given the chance to grill the Prime Minister every week in Parliament if Ed Miliband wins the next election.

The Labour leader said he wants ordinary voters to be able to take part in their own version of Prime Minister’s Questions to reinvigorate British politics.

But the plan risked backfiring, because only those willing – and able – to travel into central London would ever stand a chance of taking part.

And just a year ago Labour complained about the cost of David Cameron's events taking questions from the public across the country. 

In the latest stage of Mr Miliband’s summer relaunch, he revealed he is in talks with Commons Speaker John Bercow about staging regular public Q&A sessions in Westminster.

'I think what we need is a public question time, where regularly the prime minister submits himself or herself to questioning from members of the public in the Palace of Westminster on Wednesdays,' he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show.

'Why is that important? Because I want to let the public in to our politics.

'At the moment there is the glass that separates the public in the gallery from the House of Commons, but there is a gulf miles wide between the kind of politics people want and what Prime Minister's Questions offers.'

However, Downing Street insiders were quick to point out that David Cameron has been taking part in regular question and answer events for more than eight years.

In opposition they were known as Cameron Direct, and since taking power the PM Direct events have been held in factories, warehouses, offices and community halls across the country,

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, also subjects himself to weekly grillings on his radio phone-in on LBC 97.3.

Mr Miliband admitted his plan was in part inspired by the success of Mr Clegg’s broadcasts.

'He got a whole load of bile about it when he did it and I remember saying to people 'actually, it's good thing to do'.

'I will do that in terms of radio phone-ins but I want to do more.'

Mr Miliband argues that the weekly bouts in the Commons chamber leave voters detached from the political process

Labour said it hoped the Public Question Time would be held at least once a fortnight and possibly weekly in Parliament if the Speaker allows it.

People asking the questions ‘would be chosen by a method to ensure a wide representation of the country and political backgrounds’.

Those invited 'would not just be cheerleading Labour supporters', Mr Miliband insisted.

Embarrassingly, a year ago Labour criticsed Mr Cameron for holding Q&A sessions with voters.

In two years, the cost of 12 PM Direct events came to £50,000, which Labour MP Pamela Nash was 'a lot of taxpayers' money to be wasting on what are essentially publicity events'.

However, Labour insisted what Mr Miliband was proposing was a 'formal' chance to hold the Prime Minister to account, and not just a campaign event. 

Downing Street said it would consider the idea, but raised doubts about how voters from places like Cumbria, Northern Ireland or Penzance would get to London to take part. 

A Number 10 spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister is open to new ways of engaging with the public. He already holds regular PM Directs, where he takes questions from members of the public in towns and cities across the country.' 

But a government source added: ‘David Cameron and George Osborne are talking about fixing the economy and getting people into work. Ed Miliband is talking about his image and tweaking parliamentary procedure’.

David Cameron started holding Cameron Direct events in opposition, and they have continued since taking power, including this one at Asda in Leeds in 2012

Mr Bercow's office said it would examine any proposals submitted by the Labour leader - which it said echoed similar reforms already submitted to a review.

'The Speaker will look at Mr Miliband's suggestions with interest, when he receives them. Clearly, any changes would be a matter for the House,' his spokeswoman said.

'The Speaker's special Commission looking at the effects of the digital revolution on our democracy has received similar suggestions from people outside Parliament.

'However, it is clear that within Westminster there is also an appetite for further reforms to the way the House of Commons conducts itself.'

Mr Miliband said voters 'deserve a better debate' than one unduly focused on image.

'This isn't C-List celebrity, this isn't an ugly person's showbiz contest, this is about more than that.'

He went on: 'I will talk about a different kind of leadership which has listening as part of leading.'

He defended his decision to seek a chance to speak directly with US President Barack Obama last week - rejecting suggestions it had been an example of the sort of 'trivial' politics he criticised.
