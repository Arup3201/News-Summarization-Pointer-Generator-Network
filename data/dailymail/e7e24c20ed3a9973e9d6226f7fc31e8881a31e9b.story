A passenger who was on board the U.S. Airways plane which crashed on Thursday released a terrifying series of selfies and video footage minutes after being evacuated. 

Hannah Udren is seen on a grainy, 'Blair Witch'-style clip fleeing from the Airbus A320 along the runway along with dozens of screaming passengers.

The plane, which was on its way from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, made it into the air around 6.30pm but the takeoff was aborted. The front landing gear collapsed and the nose was badly damaged. Two of the 149 passengers suffered minor injuries.

Shortly after the dramatic crash landing, Miss Udren tweeted: 'So my plane just crashed...' along with a picture of the plane tipped up and smoke shooting along the sides.

Passengers can be heard screaming and climbing off the plane's wings and running from the emergency slides.

She can be heard breathlessly saying: 'I'm off the plane we're evacuating the plane...The plane is on fire, oh my God, oh my God... my plane just crashed.'

Smoke can be seen coming from one 
of the plane's engines 
but it is not clear if the fire started before or after the botched 
takeoff.

Bedlam: Panicked passengers ran from the plane after it skidded to a halt and climbed out an emergency door onto the wing

No
 official cause has been given for the aborted takeoff so far but one 
passenger suggested that high winds may have been a factor.

The collapsed nose gear caused the jet to skid down the runway and badly damage its front end.

It
 was 'very windy and when the plane took off the nose of the plane went 
back down, hitting the runway,' passenger Dennis Fee told WPVI. 'We were airborne, then struck back down by the nose.'

A high-wind advisory was in effect for the area, warning of wind gusts up to 60 mph at the time of the accident.

An investigation was underway into the cause of the accident. Flights were delayed for around 90 minutes following the crash. 

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from U.S. Airways.
