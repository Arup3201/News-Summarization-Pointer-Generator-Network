A British holidaymaker suffered a fatal heart attack after climbing to the top of a famous Italian volcano.

Thomas Maley, 64, was with his wife and a group of other holidaymakers when he collapsed after reaching the summit of Mount Vesuvius.

Police and local tour guides rushed to help him and a paramedic crew was also dispatched.

But despite battling for 35 minutes to save him, there was nothing they could do, and he was declared dead at the scene yesterday.

The tragedy happened after the tour party had arrived at Mt Vesuvius following a coach journey from their hotel the La Badia at nearby Sorrento.

Mr Maley, who was born in Sheffield, and his wife were due to return to England on Friday.

The tragedy happened just days after an elderly British holidaymaker died in Gran Canaria after being overcome on a hike in warm temperatures.

A police spokesman in Ercolano said: 'The victim was taken ill by the crater after arriving on a coach with other holidaymakers including his wife. It looks like he had a heart attack, the altitude could have something to do with it, as where it happened was around 1,200 metres.

'One of our patrols was already at the scene as their is a protest going on there at the moment by Vesuvius park staff so they also called for an ambulance and in total they spent 35 minutes trying to revive him but there was nothing that could be done for him.'

The spokesman added that as there were no suspicious circumstances the body had already been authorised for release and the British Consulate in Naples had not been informed.

A receptionist at the La Badia hotel said: 'The party were here with Riviera Travel but they have gone out again.

'The poor gentleman was staying here with his wife. I really don't know anything else.'

Mt Vesuvius erupted spectacularly in AD79 burying the city of Pompeii and the party had visited the museum and site there in the morning before heading off to visit the crater of the volcano which last erupted in 1944.

The tour company's website advertises the eight day £699 trip with a picture of Mt Vesuvius and adds: 'Wherever you travel in the Bay of Naples, the skyline is dominated by the majestic and still active volcano Vesuvius, rising loftily to over 4000 ft. 

'No doubt you will be aware, it has erupted in spectacular fashion several times in its history - the most famous, of course, being in 79AD when the Roman city of Pompeii, together with many of its inhabitants, were entombed and whose state of preservation today is little short of remarkable.'

No-one from the tour party was available to comment.

A spokesman from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm the death of British National Thomas Maley in Italy on May 16.

'We are providing consular assistance to the family.'

Earlier this week, Wendy Richardson, 78, collapsed with a suspected heart attack after walking in temperatures of more than 100f.

Six other pensioners also suffered health problems on the guided tour on Gran Canaria.

The Canary Island’s tourist board said the outing should never have taken place.
