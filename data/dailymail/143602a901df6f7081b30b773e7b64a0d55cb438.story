A hungry swan ruffled a few feathers when it waddled into a shop and tried to make off with crisps and chocolate.

Staff looked on in shock as the bird entered the store in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, and started pecking at the snack counter.

It took an hour to lure the bird back to its riverside home after staff and customers managed to shoo it outside.

Shop assistant Sophie Kershaw, 21, barricaded herself behind the counter when the creature strutted into the MSR Newsgroup branch on Saturday.

She looked on helplessly as the bird attempted to break into a bag of crisps with its beak before turning its attention to bars of chocolate.

Photos snapped on Sophie's mobile show the swan standing just feet from the shop's till - and eyeing up a box of mint cream chocolate bars.

After a customer managed to shoo the bird back outside, the swan waited at the door for a chance to sneak back in.

Worried the creature might suddenly run into the road and get hit by a car, Sophie called the RSPCA to come and retrieve the bird.

But before staff from the charity arrived a member of the public helped to coax it back to the nearby River Trent.

Miss Kershaw said: 'I looked up from the counter and it was just walking up to the shop, it came straight inside and I backed up to behind the counter.

'I just watched it wandering around the shop for a few minutes, it pecked at a packet of crisps trying to get into it and when that didn't work it tried a few chocolate bars.

'I put a chair and a heater in the way to stop it coming into the back of the shop - I was scared of what the swan might do.

'A few minutes later a customer came in and got it to go back outside, but then it wouldn't move away from the door.

'It was just stood there stopping customers from coming in, and every time you opened the door it would try and rush inside.

'I just thought "I can't have this", and went to get a box of cereal to tempt it away from the shop. After throwing a few handfuls out of the door it moved away for a while but kept coming back.

'I phoned my manager, who told me to call the RSPCA, but then another customer managed to get the swan back into the river.

'It was a bizarre experience, I have to admit I was in a bit of a flap.'
