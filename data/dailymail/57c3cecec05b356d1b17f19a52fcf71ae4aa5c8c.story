When chef David Nicholls was called to see his 18-year-old son lying in a hospital bed paralysed, he made him a promise that all the doctors advised against, he said he would fix it. 

But now Mr Nicholls, who can name Heston Blumenthal and Nigella Lawson among his friends, may be one step closer to realising the dream for his son.

A foundation set up by the chef to support spinal research has just funded pioneering surgery to enable Darek Fidyka, a Polish firefighter who was paralysed after he spinal cord was severed when he was stabbed, to walk again.

The surgery - hailed as world first hailed more impressive than putting a man on the Moon - could mean that spinal injuries previously deemed incurable could be cured and people left paralysed, like Mr Nicholls' son, could one day walk again.

Daniel Nicholls has not walked for the last ten years after he hit his head on a sandbank while swimming in the sea off Bondi Beach in Australia in 2003 during what was meant to be a celebration after finishing his exams.

The accident severed his spinal cord and left him with a broken neck, meaning since then he has been unable to walk or feel his legs. He also has limited movement in his arms.

His father told The Times: 'It was the most devastating thing in my life, seeing a fit, healthy, lean, good looking 18 year old boy in bed unable to move.' 

Against the advice of doctors who criticised him for giving the teenager false dreams, Mr Nicholls promised his son he would find a solution.

The former chef set up the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and managed to raise £1m by producing a cookery book with the help of celebrity chefs including Lawson and Blumenthal.

He set up the foundation to raise funds exclusively for basic medical research in the hope that a way of treating spinal injuries could be found. 

He met Geoffrey Raisman, of University College London, who had previously managed to reverse paralysis in rats by transplant cells from the nose to their spines.

Scientists from University College London (UCL) pioneered the breakthrough procedure.

It was designed to enable Darek Fidyka to walk again, after his spinal cord was sliced in half during a stabbing four years ago, leaving him paralysed below the waist.

The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the nose to the spinal cord.

OECs assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain.

The cells were transplanted into the  spinal cord, using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury.

A small piece of nerve tissue, which was taken from the ankle, was grafted onto the 'gap' in the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend, as guided by the OECs. 

This enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together – something that was previously thought to be impossible.

Three months after the operation, Mr Fidyka began to gain muscle in his left leg and regained sensations in it,  such as hot and cold, and pins and needes.

A year later, he is able to walk again, with the aid of parallel bars. 

Mr Nicholls was alerted to the research going on in Poland by Prof Raisman and decided to use the money to find a trial led by Powel Tabakow, a Polish neurosurgeon.

He said the success has left him hopeful for the future. Daniel has not benefitted from the foundation but if a cure is developed in future based on the trial, Mr Nicholls hopes his son will be 'near the front of the queue.'  

Mr Fidyka, 38, had been paralysed after he was stabbed  in 2010 leaving him with severed spinal nerves. He had suffered damage similar to that of actor Christopher Reeve, whose spine was severed from his skull after he fell off a horse in 1995. 

While some victims of partial spinal injury have recovered, a complete break was generally assumed to be irreparable. 

His condition had not improved after six months of physiotherapy and he was put forward as a candidate for the trial. 

The team worked with Mr Fidyka and removed cells from his nose, which communicate with the brain. 

The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the nose to the spinal cord. 

OECs assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain.

Two weeks later, the cells were transplanted into the spinal cord, using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury.

A small piece of nerve tissue, which was taken from the ankle, was grafted onto the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend, as guided by the OECs.

This enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together across the 'gap' – something that was previously thought to be impossible.

 A few months later Mr Fidyka started developing muscle and sensation in his legs.

Two years later he is able to walk outside the rehabilitation centre in Wrocklaw with the aid of a frame and can drive a car. 

Professor Raisman said: ‘The observed wisdom is that the central nervous system cannot regenerate damaged connections. I’ve never believed that.’

He stressed that what had been achieved was a leap forward beyond ‘plasticity’ – the re-wiring of the remaining connections. 

He compared that method to motorists finding other routes around a closed section of motorway, adding: ‘What we’re doing is repairing the motorway.’

Speaking on BBC Radio Four's Today Programme, Professor Raisman said: 'This [procedure] opens the door, which I had always been knocking at - to see that our nervous system has the ability to repair itself.

‘This is the beginning of a repair for spinal injuries and other types of injuries - including stroke.

‘The idea that the nervous system can repair itself in rats and in one man - there’s no reason to restrict this to just the spinal cord. It opens the door to a future which is terrifyingly large.

‘We’ve climbed two mountains and we are now at the foot of the (next) mountain. We have knowledge which could be of great value, we can’t stop now.' 

While the trial will need to be repeated with other patients and could take up to ten years before it becomes an accepted therapy, Mr Nicholls is hopeful for the help it could offer his son. 

The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the nose to the spinal cord where they allowed nerve cells to regrow and bridge the 'gap' in the severed spinal cord

Professor Geoffrey Raisman had met Mr Nicholls and told him about the trial in Poland to treat paralysis 

He added: 'When you realise you could be on the verge of realising your ambition, that's unique. 

'We must never be arrogant or cocky about what we've done, but it's quite remarkable.' 

Professor Geoffrey Raisman, whose team at UCL first discovered the technique, said: ‘We believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which, as it is further developed, will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury.’

He described Mr Fidyka’s recovery as ‘more impressive than man walking on the Moon’.

Professor Raisman, whose work is also published in the journal Cell Transplantation today, said: ‘[Mr Fidyka] can get around with a walker and he’s been able to resume much of his original life, including driving a car. 

'He’s not dancing, but he’s absolutely delighted.’

He continued: ‘The number of patients who are completely paralysed is enormous. 

'There are millions of them in the world. If we can convince the global neurosurgeon community that this works then it will develop very rapidly indeed.’

Dr Pawel Tabakow, of the Wroclaw Medical University in Poland, said: ‘We estimated that without this treatment, our patient’s recovery chances were less than 1 per cent. 

'However, we observed a gradual recovery of both sensory and motor function that began four months after the surgery.’

The scientists hope to treat up to 10 patients in the next few years if they can secure funding.

The research, funded by the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and UK Stem Cell Foundation, will be featured in a Panorama programme on BBC 1 tonight.
