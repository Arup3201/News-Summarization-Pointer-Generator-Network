Thousands of British skiers hoping for an idyllic winter getaway are facing disappointment as French forecasters warn there will be no snow in the Alps until January at the earliest.

Yann Giezendanner, an expert in mountain weather who works for French forecaster Meteo France, predicts there will be only 'crumbs' of snow in the region for at least the next two weeks.

In a online weather update he adds that there has been no 'season starting' snow dump because all the bad weather has hit the UK and Scandinavia instead.

Thousands of British skiers hoping for a winter getaway as the school holidays kick off this weekend are facing disappointment as Alps slopes have been left without snow (pictured, Villard-de-Lans today)

Yann Giezendanner, who has worked for forecaster Meteo France for 35 years, has predicted there will be no 'snow dump' over much of the Alps until January, leaving holidaymakers in the lurch (pictured, La Clusaz)

This was the scene in Villard-de-Lans today as resort owners have been forced to delay the start of the season after high pressure and unseasonably warm weather stopped snow from falling

Experts have noted that, so far this winter, there had been more snow in Scotland than in the Alps. 

The dire prediction comes ahead of a winter getaway this weekend at the start of the school holidays as 80,00 Britons are expected to head to the Alps in the next two weeks, according to the Crystal Ski Report.

Some resorts have already closed slopes and canceled events because of a lack of snow.

Webcams in the alpine resort of La Clusaz show only a thin covering of snow on the largely muddy, grassy ground, while officials there were forced to cancel the cross country skiing World Cup.

The event, which was due to be held at La Clusaz last week, was instead moved to Davos in Switzerland, where the snow is deeper. 

Pierre Lestas, who manages ski lifts at the winter retreat, told The Times: 'At the moment we don't have enough snow to open the slops. We need another 20cm.'

Meanwhile at Villard-de-Lans resort, slopes director Didier Beuque admitted that there was not enough snow to provide 'quality holidays', adding that the situation was 'very worrying'.

Officials at La Clusaz were forced to cancel the cross country skiing World Cup last weekend due to a lack of snow (pictured, the snowless village square in La Clusaz which is at low altitude)

As well as problems at Villard-de-Lans (pictured), Chamonix Mont-Blanc has been forced to close, while just a single piste was open yesterday in the hugley popular resort of Les Arcs

Neither location is predicted to get more than 6cm of snow between now and Christmas day, according to data on weather-forecast.com.

Val d’Isère, normally one of the most reliable resorts in Europe for snow, also cancelled the men’s World Cup giant slalom and slalom races last weekend.

That is despite having invested in the largest snow-making machine in Europe, as these require air temperatures of -6C to work. Temperatures on the first weekend of December reached 5C.

In La Rosiere locals have said it is the worst start to a season  since 1962, while problems have also been reported at the hugely popular resort of Les Arcs.

The tourist retreat, which is made up of four camps at varying altitudes, comprises half of the giant Paradiski skiing domain. 

The Chamonix Mont-Blanc resort (pictured) is currently closed due to lack of snow, while the website says it may open this weekend 'depending on snow cover'

Webcams at the top of a ski lift 2000ft up the side of Mont Blanc captured these images today, showing a very thin coating of snow on the ground

But yesterday there was only one ski lift and one 0.6mile (1km) piste open at the highest altitude while the resort’s daily ski report said the nearest fresh snow fell 77 miles (124km) away.

Ski instructor Philippe Arnauld said: ‘At the moment it is just about okay because the start of the season is never that busy, but from next weekend the resorts will be full for Christmas and New Year.

‘If all the ski schools and the holiday making families have only two lifts between them it is going to be chaos and a catastrophe - and no significant snowfall, perhaps only a few snowflakes, is predicted between now and Christmas. I have no idea what will happen and how we will manage.’ 

Also badly affected is Chamonix Mont-Blanc which was unable to open last weekend due to lack of snow, and according to its website may open this weekend 'depending on snow cover'.

Elsewhere, other resorts only opened a fraction of pistes on higher slopes, including a third of the 154 slopes at Tignes, 11 out of 137 at La Plagne and eight out of 95 at Courchevel.

Yann Giezendanner predicts there will only be 'crumbs' of snow over the Alps until the New Year at the earliest, as all the wet weather is hitting the UK and Scandinavia instead
