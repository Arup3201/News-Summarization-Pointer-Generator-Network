Driverless cars are to be allowed on public roads for the first time after the Government today gives the green-light for trials to take place this year.

Most big car-makers are already developing self-drive technology and incorporating elements of it into cars already on the road.

During the ground-breaking road tests of semi-autonomous vehicles later this year, an expert will have to remain in the driving seat.

The future: Most big car-makers are already developing self-drive technology and incorporating elements of it into cars already on the road

Scientists at Oxford University are working with Nissan in Sunderland to create ‘robotcars’ that can drive themselves independently using details of the road they are driving on stored in on-board software.

Other vehicles being developed by Sweden’s Volvo, Vauxhall’s US parent General Motors, and Germany’s Mercedes-Benz and VW groups take their cues from their surroundings.

The Nissan self-drive Leaf electric car is controlled by an iPad, and the Oxford team behind it claim the technology could be installed in mainstream cars as a £60 option.

Cameras and lasers built into its chassis map a 3D model of its surroundings when it is driven manually, which is fed into a computer stored in the boot.

The car can then ‘remember’ routes. It prompts the driver via an iPad on the dashboard to engage the autopilot and, at a touch of the screen, the car assumes control.

A laser at the front scans 164ft ahead 13 times per second for obstacles, such as pedestrians, cyclists, or other cars in an 85-degree field of view.

If it senses an obstacle, it slows and comes to a controlled stop. The driver can tap the brake pedal to regain control of the vehicle from the computer.

Backers say robot cars could lead to cheaper insurance because the vehicle will know what is up ahead on the road better than the driver, who must chose to switch to autonomous driving.
