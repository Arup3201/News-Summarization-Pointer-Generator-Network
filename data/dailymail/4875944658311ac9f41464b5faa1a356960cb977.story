Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker has promised to get rid of a controversial goatee beard after admitting it was 'c***' - but has a fight on his hands from his wife who 'likes the Robin Hood look'.

Following the deluge of criticism of his facial hair after Saturday’s programme the 53-year-old said he would shave it off, but Danielle Lineker says she is 'wrestling the razor from him'.

It appears the former England striker has not learned his lesson about facial hair because he was ridiculed in 2011 after growing a much-maligned moustache.

Poor form: Gary Lineker's goatee beard has been panned and the BBC presenter has pledged to shave it off

Tweeting about his new beard he said: ‘Seems like the overall verdict was great show, c**p goatee! It’s going.’

Seeing the funny side he added: 'It's a Des Lynam, Jimmy Hill tribute'. 

But his 35-year-old wife Danielle may have other ideas about him removing the beard and told a friend: ‘Currently wresting the razor from him. Like the Robin Hood look.’

When the former Spurs and Barcelona striker grew a moustache after being dared to by his children a few years ago, it caused an outcry, with one TV viewer saying it made him look ‘like he’s eaten a bowl of iron filings without using his hands’.

But the Match Of The Day presenter’s new goatee beard has provoked an even stronger response.

Piers Morgan compared him to d'Artagnan from The Three Musketeers while Russell Brand hailed a 'new era' for the show

One viewer said it ‘turned you from respectable presenter to snake-oil salesman’, while another claimed to have ‘officially stopped paying the licence fee until the beard goes’, adding: ‘It’s scaring my six-year-old.’ 

Gary Lineker was not the only Match of the Day pundit to be criticised for his appearance.

New boy Phil Neville, panned during the World Cup for his dull commentary, was targeted because of his blonde highlights.
