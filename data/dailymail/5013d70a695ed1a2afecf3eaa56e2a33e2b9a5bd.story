He may be one of the coolest men on the planet but James Bond actor Daniel Craig was getting heated as he watched his beloved Liverpool take on Manchester City.

The 007 star was watching Brendan Rodgers' men take on City - who pipped them to the Premier League title by just two points - at the Yankee Stadium in New York in a pre-season friendly.

And he reacted angrily to some decisions being given against the Reds by gesturing and complaining.
