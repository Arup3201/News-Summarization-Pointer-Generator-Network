An 'aunties army' is needed to combat the epidemic of eating disorders and self-harming among young girls, a leading child psychologist has warned.

Steve Biddulph, author of the ground-breaking 1998 book Raising Boys, has become more concerned about today’s girls – and believes aunts should help bring up their nieces to increase the positive female role models in their lives.

In his previous work, Biddulph said boys were seen as a ‘disaster area’ compared to girls.

He said parents should delay their 
sons starting formal education and suggested an increase in single-sex 
classes in co-educational schools to help them reach their full 
potential.

But today, he argues, girls are giving greater cause for concern.

Biddulph says young girls are in a 
‘catastrophic’ state of crisis because of the ‘toxic’ influences of 
advertising, celebrity and pornography which pressurise them to grow up 
too quickly.

In his new book, Raising Girls, he 
writes: ‘To understand our daughters, we have to realise that their 
childhood is not like ours. To put it bluntly, our 18 is their 14. Our 
14 is their ten.

‘Never before has girlhood been under 
such a sustained assault, ranging through  everything from diet ads,  
alcohol marketing and fashion pressures, to the inroads  of hard 
pornography into teenage bedrooms.’

He adds: ‘About five years ago . . . we began to see a sudden and marked plunge in girls’ mental health.

‘Problems such as eating disorders and
 self-harm, which once had been extremely rare, were now happening in 
every classroom and every street.   But more than this, the  average 
girl was stressed and depressed in a way we hadn’t seen before.’

However, he argues the ‘enormous pain 
and confusion’ that girls experience can be eased by increasing the 
number of women in their lives – other than their mothers – who can act 
as mentors.

Biddulph said parents and relatives 
are not supporting girls in the way they did in the past. He added: ‘We 
haven’t put enough adult time and care around our daughters, or taught 
them well enough.’

Parents can avoid many of the pitfalls of having teenage girls by helping them find their identity between the ages of ten and 14, when girls start to feel a stronger sense of individuality, according to psychologist Steve Biddulph.

If parents help their daughter find her ‘spark’ – something that she loves to do that gives her purpose – it will help free her from the need for approval that haunts many girls and diminishes their confidence, Biddulph writes in his book Raising Girls.

He suggests parents should ask their children ‘what do you really love to do?’ and ‘how can I help you to do that?’

He lists skills or talents, such as drawing or dancing, that should be encouraged because children enjoy finding something they excel in.

Biddulph writes that as children reach this age, parents should spend more time with them because it is a key period in helping girls find what makes them truly happy.

Biddulph, who has a son and a 
daughter, said that parents must spend more time with their children and
 organise events to include other relatives.

He said that by widening  the net of 
parental responsibility to include women relatives, girls would feel 
encouraged to share problems and confide in older people.

Biddulph said this is important 
because girls do not always get on well with their mothers and do not 
feel they can discuss certain subjects with them.

The idea of the ‘aunties army’ can be 
seen in the example of actress Julia Roberts who is devoted to her 
brother’s daughter, up-and-coming actress Emma.

The 21-year-old, who bears a striking 
resemblance to her aunt, has been steadily carving out a career under 
her aunt’s mentorship, starring in teen movies Wild Child and Nancy 
Drew, and appearing with her aunt in the 2010 romantic comedy 
Valentine’s Day.

When Emma was a child, her aunt allowed her to spend weeks on set with her.

Biddulph’s new book is due to be 
published later this month and follows the success of Raising Boys, 
which has sold 3million copies worldwide.
