A close encounter with an adventurous kangaroo has left a motorcyclist a little jumpy after it hurled itself into oncoming traffic.

The video was filmed through a camera, believed to be attached to the rider's helmet, travelling along Plenty Road and South Morang, north-east of Melbourne in Victoria at 11.30am on Wednesday.

The footage shows the motorcyclist riding down a busy road when the roo appeared on the left hand side of the motorway before dashing out into the traffic and narrowly missing the rider.

Close encounter with a kangaroo has left a motorcyclist a little jumpy after it hurled itself into oncoming traffic

As the motorcyclist is seen slightly swerving  to avoid the collision before he continues riding along the road but looks back a few times to see where the roo has ended.

But as he rides further away, it is not known where the kangaroo was travelling or whether it collided with a vehicle.

The clip, titled: 'Straya mate! Nearly got me! Near miss motorcycle with kangaroo' was published on Youtube by user LugoFezz.

A caption alongside the video explained: 'Riding up Plenty Rd through a built up area of South Morang is not where you expect a Kangaroo to go all suicidal on your motorcycle. 

'If I had a pillion I would have lost them, way too close for comfort.'
