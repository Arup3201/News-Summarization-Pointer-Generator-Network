The segregated water fountains and signs pointing African-Americans to the back entrances of movie theaters have long disappeared from the streets of the South. 

But in one small South Carolina city there still sits a war memorial that lists fallen World War I and II soldiers in two categories: 'white' and 'colored'. 

Greenwood mayor Welborn Adams has been trying to replace the bronze nameplate with plaques that represent the equality of his city today. 

But a state law and critics - of both races - has helped divide the city and made the mayor's fight much harder than he first expected.  

A war memorial honoring fallen soldiers from Greenwood county (pictured) separates the men into two categories: 'colored' and 'white' 

On two sides of the memorial, the names of fallen soldiers from Greenwood county who died during World War I and II are separated by race.

Racial distinction is absent from the third side of the monument, which lists those who died during the Korean and Vietnam wars, because the military was no longer segregated. 

Last year the American Legion post, which owns the memorial, asked Adams if he could raise $15,000 privately to change the monument. 

Adams, who is white and Democratic-leaning, was so confident he would receive the money he took out a loan so the new plaques could be ready and revealed on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.

And he had no trouble coming up with the payment. 

Forty-three donors, most of whom were white, gave money for the new memorial, and Adams likewise wrote a $1,000 check for the cause.

But the mayor's troubles had only just begun. 

South Carolina's Confederate flag law forbids any historical monument erected by the state or local government from being relocated, removed, disturbed or altered without a two-thirds vote from the state's lawmakers.

The law was created in 2000 after people worried the removal of the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome would encourage the destruction of memorials and street and park names that honored Confederate generals.

Opponents said they could use the law as grounds for having Adams arrested, a threat made just days before the MLK day ceremony, if he went forward with the new plaque.

And after the city's lawyer told Adams his opponents were right about the law, the ceremony was halted. The mayor said he cried in his office.

'I wonder if some of the opposition is racism hiding behind history,' said Adams.  

Historians, both black and white, have argued that the plaques serve as an important reminder of the once-segregated U.S. military. 

Eric Williams, who spent 32 years as a historian with the U.S. Park Service and is white, said altering the monument would be altering 'its historical integrity.'   

Williams, one of the most vocal critics against the change, believes it would be better to add a small display next to the monument explaining why the names are segregated. 

Chad Williams of Brandeis University in Boston, who has extensively studied black soldiers in World War I, agreed that the additional sign would be much more powerful and historically accurate.  

'I think it is important to acknowledge the specific context in how African-American soldiers had to serve in the military,' Williams said.

And activist Joseph McGill equates talk about switching plaques to schools banning Mark Twain's 'Huckleberry Finn' because of the racially offensive language from the 1800s sprinkled throughout the book.

McGill, who spends the night in old slave cabins to get attention to preserve them, said changing the monument 'could just spread the perception that segregation did not exist or wasn't that bad'. 

Opposition only heightened after the mayor was quoted saying, in a local newspaper story about the memorial, 'I think if history offends people it needs to be rewritten if possible.'  

Historians, both black and white, have argued that the plaques (pictured) serve as an important reminder of the once-segregated U.S. military and that changing them would hurt the memorial's 'historical integrity'

The mayor later acknowledged he didn't choose his words carefully, and said he meant that while history doesn't change, the way a community presents itself does. 

A bill has been filed to change the Greenwood memorial and half of the members of the state Senate are listed as sponsors, but some legislators who helped craft the Confederate flag law are leery to bring the divisive issue up again.

Republican Sen. John Courson, who has been in the Senate since 1985, said he would look at the bill but doesn't 'want to reopen the whole debate'.

'That was last century's battle.'

Adams said he asked other South Carolina mayors and doesn't know of any other similar memorials in the state.

Several historians also said they haven't heard of a monument where fallen soldiers are separated by race. 

Freelance journalist Will Moredock, who is trying to get South Carolina to remove the statue of a segregationist  from the Statehouse grounds, is one of the mayor supporters.

'Every generation has the right to choose the people and the causes it wishes to enshrine in its public places,' Moredock said.

The  Confederate flag removed in 2000 is now in front of the the state's Capitol alongside a Confederate soldier monument. It remains a sore point for the NAACP and other black leaders. 

As for the old plaques, Adams had originally planed to put them in the county museum. 

For now they remain on the monument, as the new ones sit in a storage space in City Hall while the Legislature prepares to act.

'I am fully aware this is much tougher than I ever expected,' Adams said. 'But it's the right thing to do.'
