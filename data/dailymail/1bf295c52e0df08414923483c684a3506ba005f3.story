An Ohio woman shot dead a masked intruder after she found him standing over her sleeping son with a knife in his hands, only to discover later that the victim had been her son's childhood friend.

Reb Barbee, 17, from Prairie Township in Franklin County, was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the back Sunday after he broke into the home of Heather Tackett in the middle of the night.

Police have arrested three teenagers on charges of murder and complicity to aggravated burglary.

Mistaken identity: Reb Barbee, 18 (left and right), was shot dead after allegedly breaking into the house of his friend's mother, who did not know it was him because he was wearing a mask  

Home invasion: Heather Tackett discovered Barbee standing over her son's bed with a knife in his hands as the teen slept 

Investigators say the murder counts stem from the suspects’ failure to seek medical help for their wounded friend.

Tackett, 37, who fired the fatal shot, told police she did not call 911 to report the incident because she did not think she hit Barbee, who fled her home, The Columbus Dispatch reported. 

The incident unfolded at around 4am Sunday when Ms Tackett entered the room of her 17-year-old son, Jake, to find a figure wearing an Insane Clown Posse mask standing over the sleeping teen with a knife in his hands.

The mother reportedly screamed at the trespasser and then fired a single shot from her boyfriend's .38-caliber revolver.

The masked man, later identified as Reb Barbee, took off running, leaving behind a trail of blood, police said.

Accomplices: Adam Pickens, 18 (left), Tyler Blazer, 17 (right) and another 17-year-old have been charged with murder and complicity to aggravated burglary for allegedly helping Barbee break into the Tackett residence and then failing to seek medical help for the mortally wounded teen

It was not until hours later that police came to Tackett and informed her that she shot and killed her son's old friend, who used to come over for sleepovers.

‘I am devastated,’ Tackett said. ‘I really liked that kid and I was really good to him, and it breaks my heart he’d enter my home like that.’

According to police, Barbee snuck into Ms Tackett's home on Hubbard Drive South by climbing through a second-floor bathroom window with the help of three friends, who stayed behind acting as lookouts.

After the shooting, Tyler Blazer and Brandon Hamilton, both 17, and Adam Pickens, 18, wheeled their mortally wounded friend in a computer chair all the way back to his house on Donovan Place half a mile away.

About an hour later, Pickens called 911 telling the dispatcher that his friend has been shot, and that the wound appeared to be self-inflicted, ABC6 On Your Side reported. The 18-year-old added that he did not want to get his friend in trouble.

Barbee had been friends with Jake Tackett and attended sleepovers at his house, but the two had a falling out a year ago, according to Heather Tackett

Reb Barbee was rushed to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound at 6am.

Hamilton and Balzer have been charged as minors, while Pickens is facing the same counts as an adult. He is being held on $250,000 bond.

The prosecutor's office will determine if Heather Takectt will face charges in Barbee's deadly shooting.

The mother said she would not have discharged the revolver had the boy identified himself, or at least said something to her.
