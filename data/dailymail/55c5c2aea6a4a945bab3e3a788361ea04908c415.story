Manchester City were given a huge boost on Thursday as star striker Sergio Aguero returned to training following a knee ligament injury.

The Argentine hitman has been sidelined since December 6 when a challenge from Everton's Muhamed Besic left him in tears on the touchline.

But he was pictured back in action at City's training ground as Manuel Pellegrini's men prepare to face the Toffees in the return fixture at Goodison Park.

Aguero's left knee was still heavily strapped as he took part in Thursday's session, while his fellow striker Edin Dzeko also took part after recovering from a calf problem.

It appears likely that Saturday's clash against Roberto Martinez's side will come too soon for the pair, with Stevan Jovetic likely to keep his place up-front.

Aguero scored 14 goals in 15 Premier League appearances before being injured and a return against Arsenal on January 18 looks like most likely for the former Atletico Madrid man.

Skipper Vincent Kompany, who has not played since the 1-0 win against Leicester on December 13, is also in contention again after overcoming a troublesome hamstring injury.

Midfielder Frank Lampard also looked to be in good spirits as he trained alongside Aguero on Thursday.

The ex-Chelsea man has had his short-term deal at the Etihad extended until the end of the season and he could start against Everton as Pellegrini looks to keep his squad fresh following the busy festive period.

Meanwhile, City are continuing negotiations with Swansea over striker Wilfried Bony with a £30million deal expected to be completed within the next few days.

Pellegrini is keen to strengthen his attacking options after being forced to play James Milner as an emergency forward while Aguero, Dzeko and Jovetic were all out injured.
