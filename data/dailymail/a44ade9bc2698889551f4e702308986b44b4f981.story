Amy Pitcher, 27, claims she was refused entry to Cameo, in Ashford, Kent, because she was too fat

An overweight woman is demanding an apology from a nightclub which turned her and her friend away - because they were too fat. 

Amy Pitcher, 27, carefully selected her outfit for the VIP reopening of the newly-refurbished club Cameo, in Ashford, Kent.

Miss Pitcher, who is a size 18, was wearing an orange dress, a smart black jacket, and sparkly high heeled shoes. 

But when they arrived at the club she says they were told all the tickets had gone.

Then she claims a doorman told her and her friend, who is a size 20, that they did not have the 'right style' and turned them all away.

She said: 'I couldn't believe it. 

'He said he didn't want to hurt our feelings, but our size and style didn't go with the image they want to promote.

'I was completely shocked, just stared at him and said "oh".

'I am a size 18 and my friend is a 20. I was dressed appropriately and so were my friends.

'I was wearing an orange dress with a black jacket and sparkly heels.

'We didn't cause any trouble, none of us got angry and we just walked away shocked and quite embarrassed.'

NHS worker Miss Pitcher, who has been a member of Slimming World for two years, sent an email complaint to manager of the club and got no reply.

But the club has since been in touch offering a complimentary night out for her and her friends.

Miss Pitcher, of Ashford, added: 'We had a good rant about them when we left and just tried to enjoy the rest of the night as best we could but it completely ruined our evening.

'I mean it's not like we're going to eat all the furniture and drink all the drinks.'

Miss Pitcher and her friends had gone to the club on Saturday, December 6 - the night after it opened.

I mean it's not like we're going to eat all the furniture and drink all the drinks'

She added: 'On the club's Facebook page someone else said he had been turned away because he had long hair.

'I was shocked and upset because they were making judgement on the appearance of people's sizes when I know from personal struggle how difficult it is to be accepted.

'Just because someone is skinny or prettier doesn't mean they are nice people or not going to cause trouble in a club.

'Everybody is an individual - the average size of the population is size 16.'

A club spokesman strongly denied any discrimination, but said they had operated a more strict dress code for the opening weekend.

General manager Fred Shingler said: 'We have just invested £1.25 million in creating a luxurious high end club and to maintain standards, operate a strict dress code.

'We categorically did not refuse entry on the grounds of weight; we do not discriminate against anyone and positively welcome guests who comply with our smart dress policy.

'The complaint occurred on our opening night when the club was full to capacity and our door teams were being extra vigilant.

'We have since spoken to the lady and invited her back to the club to enjoy a night out on us.

'We will also be updating our website to ensure that our dress code is more prominent, although the final decision always has to rest at the point of entry.'
