It has taken $70million at box offices across the US in its opening weekend - but Cinderella is facing an online backlash over the lead character's 'unnaturally small' waist.

The Disney remake of the classic fairy tale stars English actress Lily James who has revealed she was on a liquid diet at times during filming while wearing a tight-fitting corset for the role. 

The $95million live-action fantasy ran in to controversy even before its release date amid accusations that digital trickery had been used to alter the 25-year-old actress's waist to make it appear smaller.

Hitting back: Last week Miss James (pictured as Cinderella) hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie

This was denied by Walt Disney Pictures and the film's director 54-year-old Sir Kenneth Branagh, while a representative for Miss James insisted the look was achieved with the use of a corset alone.

But the row continued on Twitter today after the movie's public release, with many people critical of just how effective the item proved to be at shrinking her waist and others even calling for fans to boycott the movie.

Rochelle Schattner wrote: 'Boycott #Cinderella by Disney for making Cinderella's waist disturbing to look at and setting up unrealistic expectations.'

Another Twitter user, Kyla, said: 'What I gleaned from the new Cinderella is that if you're docile and nice to rats, you too can have a waist the circumference of a Coke can.'

Controversy: Twitter users have gone online to question the size of the lead character's waistline

Some have even called for fans to boycott the movie claiming Cinderella's tiny waistline sets up 'unrealistic expectations'

Backlash: Some complained that Cinderella's small waist was not 'setting a positive example for girls in today's society

Others described Cinderella's waist as 'nearly non-existent' as the Twitter backlash continued over the weekend

Janelle Walker added: 'Pretty sure Lily James's corset made her waist 4 inches round in #Cinderella. Not setting a positive example for girls in today's society.' 

A review of the film by vox.com was also critical of Cinderella's tiny waist.

'What's crazy about this version is that Cinderella ends up with a supernaturally thin waist, thanks to a corset that James has complained wouldn't let her swallow whole foods,' the review said.

'Is it just me, or is the animated Cinderella's waist actually slightly larger? And even if it's not, it's still weird to try to get an adult human being down to cartoon proportions.

'The message seems clear. On the most magical night of her life, Cinderella's waist is size negative two.'

Cinderella also found success internationally as it made $62.4million overseas including $25million in China, which was a record for a March opening there. 

Last week Miss James hit out at 'upsetting' and 'boring' criticism of her tiny waist in the movie. 

The Downton Abbey actress insisted she was healthy and 'always has been' and that she 'shouldn't have to' field questions about her frame.

She told E! News that she was keen to be a positive role model for girls telling the website: 'For girls growing up, sometimes I think they get the wrong idea for what women should look like.

'And I think it's so important to be healthy and confident and natural. And not put too much stress on trying to be thin—I don't get the thin, thin thing at all.'

Some took to Twitter over the weekend to defend Disney's portrayal of Cinderella.

Shannon Ellison wrote: 'When did being thin, or wearing clothes that make your waist look small, cause this self-righteous anger and condescending pity? #Cinderella.'
