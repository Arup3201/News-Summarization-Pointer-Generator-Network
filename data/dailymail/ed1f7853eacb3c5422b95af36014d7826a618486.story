A new poll suggests that the majority of the people who voted Ukip at the European elections will also vote for the party at the General Election less than a year away.

In the ComRes survey 86 per cent of the people who put their cross in Ukip’s box will do so again in May 2015.

For the first time in its history the Conservative Party did not come first or second in a national election beaten into third place by Nigel Farage’s ‘people’s army’ and Ed Miliband’s Labour.

They're not going away, you know: A ComRes survey would appear to show that Ukip can expect to retain 86 per cent of its support at the General Election

More than 4.3million people voted for Ukip to give it its first national win.

Tory ministers explained that away by saying that voters had merely ‘loaned’ their vote to Mr Farage’s party and would return to the fold in time for the General Election.

ComRes’s poll taken a few days after the European elections appears to show that these suppositions are misguided.

The survey found that 37 per cent of Ukip voters said that they were ‘certain’ to support the party at the General Election. Another 49 per cent said that they were ‘likely’ to do so, while a mere 14 per cent said that they would probably cast their vote elsewhere.

The ComRes poll was commissioned by Paul Sykes, Ukip’s biggest financial backer. Mr Sykes has also pledged to help Ukip cause another major upset in this week’s Newark by-election.

The Conservatives are so worried by another potential Ukip win that on Thursday of this week they sent five ministers including George Osborne, the Chancellor, Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Sajid Javid, the Culture Secretary, to glad-hand the electorate in the constituency.

David Cameron and Boris Johnson have also visited Newark to try to bolster support for their party.

The by-election was caused by the resignation of Tory Patrick Mercer (maj. 16,152) over a cash for questions scandal and at the moment the Conservatives lead Ukip by 36 to 28 per cent but Tory support is down 18 percentage points since the General Election while Ukip has gained 24 percentage points.

Mr Sykes said that the ComRes poll findings should make the Conservatives realise that Ukip will threaten them at the General Election.

‘Conservative MPs, with a few honourable exceptions, appear to be in denial about the scale of the popular uprising against our current rulers.

This is despite their party finishing third in the elections,’ he said. ‘They appear to think that the Ukip threat will go away (it won’t) or that the economic recovery will float them off the political rocks.

'They should recall what happened in 1997. Then the economy had been growing strongly for four years. That did not stop John Major going down to the worst Tory defeat since 1832.’

According to ComRes, 46 per cent of Ukip’s European voters supported the Tories at the 2010 General Election while 15 per cent had been Labour voters, and 16 per cent Liberal Democrats.
