Two teenage boys were shot dead after getting into an argument on Facebook over a stolen powercord, the mother of one of the victims has claimed.

Best friends Jordan Means, 16, and Anthony Bankhead, 18, were found dead in an apartment basement in Chicago on Saturday morning.

Jordan's mother, Camille Cochran, has now claimed her son had got into an argument with his killer just the night before on Facebook.

The 42-year-old told DNAinfo Chicago that Anthony had got into an argument with three older men about 'something petty' - a stolen powercord - the night before he was killed.

She claims one of the men pulled a gun on Anthony but didn't fire it.

The argument then continued on Facebook in the lead-up to the boys' murders.

She told the Chicago Sun-Times: 'An argument led to this, that’s crazy. Now, I don’t have my son no more.'

The mother-of-three also paid tribute to her youngest son who was a sophomore at Bowen High School with a passion for basketball. 

Jordan's sister Magen Wllis, 24, added: 'Nobody deserves to get killed like that. Not at 16.'

Police would not confirm Ms Cochran's claims.

Her son Jordan lived with her in South Chicago - just one block from where he was killed. She believes Anthony was homeless and had been sleeping in the building where the boys were shot.

Friends gathered at the scene hours after his body was found at 10.30am and lit candles in tribute.

Police have not yet arrested anyone in connection with the murders.

Jordan and his friend Anthony were among five people shot to death across the city since Friday evening. Another 16 have been wounded.
