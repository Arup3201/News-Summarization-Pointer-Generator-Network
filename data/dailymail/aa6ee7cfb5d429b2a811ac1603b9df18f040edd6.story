More than 300 people have died in two factory fires in Pakistan.

Flames ripped through a garment factory in Karachi, killing 289 people. Hours earlier, a fire killed at least 25 workers in a shoe factory in Lahore.

Last night it was claimed in Pakistan that the factory in Karachi supplied clothes to Selfridges and other shops in the UK.

A relative of one of the owners of the factories said many other clothes made there ended up in the UK.

The factory is about 3000 square yards which had four main gates. Three of which were closed after a theft in the factory.

All the four owners of the factory are still at large. The items of the company were also exported to states of Northern America.

Many women and children were thought to be among the dead in Karachi, where a lot of the victims were burned alive.

Others suffocated in the four-storey building, which had metal grilles on many of the windows.

Workers have revealed how they jumped
from third floor windows to escape the blaze at a garment factory in 
Karachi, where many victims were trapped in a basement.

In Lahore, staff at a shoe factory claimed a faulty generator sparked the fire.

'We saw our colleagues burning alive,
in flames,' said Shabdir Hussain, from his hospital bed. 'We could do 
nothing. We saved our lives by jumping from the roof.'

Firefighters were still trying to subdue the blaze in Karachi yesterday morning, as hospital staff revealed its morgue was full with 'around 30 bodies burnt beyond recognition all lined up'.

'People started screaming for their 
lives,' said factory worker Mohammad Asif, 20. 'Everyone came to the window. I jumped 
from the third floor.'

Another worker, Liaqat Hussain, 29, spoke from his hospital bed where he was being treated for burns all over his body. He said: 'Within two minutes there was fire in 
the entire factory.

'The gate was closed. There was no access to get out, we were trapped inside.'

Fire chief Ehtisham-ud-Din said 
most of the garment factory deaths were caused by suffocation as people 
caught in the basement were unable to escape.

Senior Superintendent of Police Amir 
Farooqi revealed that police were raiding parts of Karachi to search
for the owners of the factory, which employed around 450 people.

Smoke was still rising from the garment 
factory as rescue workers pulled out charred corpses and covered them in
white sheets.

Weeping relatives of workers stood around in the street awaiting 
word of their fate.

At least 35 people were injured. The cause of the fire is not yet known.

The death toll from the late Tuesday fires is likely to raise fresh questions about industrial safety in the South Asian nation and draw more criticism of the deeply unpopular government.

Critics say Pakistan's government is too corrupt and ineffective to focus on the welfare of workers and a dizzying array of other problems, from crippling power cuts, to widespread poverty to a Taliban insurgency.

Successive governments have been unable to provide a reliable power supply so factories have to have their own generators, powered by diesel or petrol, if they want to avoid regular, lengthy power cuts. Today Gap denied it sourced clothes from the factory.
