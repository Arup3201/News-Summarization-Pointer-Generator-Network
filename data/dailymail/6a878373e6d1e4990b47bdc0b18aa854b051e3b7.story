The daughter of NFL legend Joe Namath received some shocking news last week about a dog she'd lost more than five years ago: the animal was alive and well and living about 200 miles from her Florida home.

Jessica Namath, a 28-year-old photographer, lost her pet Shih Tzu, Tula, at the home of her former fiance in 2008, when the dog wandered into the front yard, which was not uncommon for the animal.

Ten minutes later, however, Tula was gone - and Namath was devastated.

Namath went to great lengths to find the dog - knocking on neighbors' doors, making calls to the Highway Patrol and animal control and placing fliers throughout the area.

Namath and friends even searched nearby canals in kayaks, and she went so far as to visit three different psychics looking for her lost pooch.

She even offered a reward of $2,000 for anyone who could locate her lost dog.

All of her efforts were for naught, though, and the dog appeared to be lost forever.

On Wednesday, Namath got a call from 42-year-old Michael Cecere, who lives about 200 miles away in St. Petersburg.

Earlier that afternoon, Cecere had been running errands when a small, brown Shih Tzu wandered in front of his car. He took the dog to houses in the area in an attempt to find the owner, but nobody recognized the small dog.

Cecere then took the dog to the ParkView Animal Hospital, where a tracking chip embedded in the animal revealed that it belonged to Jessica Namath.

Desperate: Namath did everything she could to find her lost dog, including consulting psychics

cecere tracked down Namath's current phone number on Facebook and gave her a call.

'I could hear her jaw drop over the phone,' Cecere told the Tampa Bay Times.

The next day, Cecere met her in Yeehaw Junction - about halfway between Jupiter and St. Petersburg - and returned the long, lost dog. 

Upon meeting, both Namath and Cecere had the same question: how did the dog end up 200 miles away from home?

Enter Yanelys Miranda, who says she found the dog about a year after it disappeared from Namath's former finace's yard.

Miranda says she found the mangy dog on a street in West Palm Beach - not far from Jupiter - and it had missing teeth, sores and hair peeling off in chunks.

'She was almost dying,' Miranda said. 'The poor thing.'

Miranda says she and her family - including two children, ages 7 and 11 - nursed the dog back to health and it became part of the family. She says she didn't think to look for an identification chip because of the poor condition the dog was in. 

In 2011, Miranda and her family moved to St. Petersburg and brought their beloved Shih Tzu, which they named Lulu, along.

She says someone must have left the gate to their home open because Lulu had run off and the family was devastated.

According to Miranda, she places a 'lost dog' ad on Craigslist, which is how she discovered that her family's lost Lulu was actually Namath's Tula.

Tula is now back with Namath, as Miranda has 'two crying children' who just lost their dog.

'It's a huge loss for us,' Miranda said. 'But what can we do?'

Namath tells MailOnline she hopes her story will help people realize the importance of microchipping pets, as well as scanning found animals to they can be returned to their rightful owners.
