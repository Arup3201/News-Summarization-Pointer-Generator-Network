An ancient partial skull provides the earliest evidence that modern humans lived alongside Neanderthals and could have interbred 55,000 years ago.

Recently discovered in Manot Cave in West Galilee, Israel, the bone sheds new light on our ancient relatives living in the area.

The find challenges a previous theory that the two species potentially met 45,000 years ago somewhere in Europe.

The ‘Levantine cranium from Manot Cave (Israel) foreshadows the First European modern humans,’ according to the study, published in Nature.

Modern Europeans have inherited about four percent of their genes from Neanderthals, meaning the two groups mated at some point in the past. 

‘It has been suspected that modern man and Neanderthals were in the same place at the same time, but we didn't have the physical evidence. Now we do have it in the new skull fossil,’ said palaeontologist Bruce Latimer, from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Despite the speculation, there is as yet no proof that the skull is from an individual descended from a human-Neanderthal tryst. But, the researchers said, the specimen 'provides important clues about the morphology of modern humans in close chronological proximity to a probable interbreeding event with Neanderthals.'

 The prehistoric cave (pictured) has an impressive archaeological sequence and spectacular speleothems - mineral deposits formed from groundwater within underground caverns, such as stalactites, the experts said

The enormous Manot cave was discovered by accident after a bulldozer broke through the roof while cutting a sewer trench for a nearby village. It's thought to have remained sealed for as long as 30,000 years

Manot Cave, in West Galilee is located in the region where Neanderthals periodically lived - perhaps when ice sheets in Europe forced them to migrate to warmer locales, such as the Levant region

Animal bones and prehistoric tools were among the other discoveries made inside the Manot Cave

It is commonly thought that Neanderthals died out because they were unable to compete with modern humans for food and resources.

A recent study by the University of Oxford suggests that both groups co-existed for between 2,600 and 5,400 years and some interbreeding occurred.

Experts believe that Neanderthals ‘may have survived in dwindling pockets of Europe’ for several thousand years before becoming extinct, instead of being immediately replaced by modern humans.

The study didn’t cover eastern regions such as Uzbekistan and Siberia, where Neanderthals are also known to have lived.

‘So it is still possible Neanderthals lingered later in some areas,’ Professor Chris Stringer said.

‘Overall pattern seems clear - the Neanderthals had largely, and perhaps entirely, vanished from their known range by 39,000 years ago.’

It is situated along the only land route available for ancient humans to travel out of Africa to the Middle East, Asia and Europe. 

‘Modern humans and Neanderthals likely encountered each other foraging for food,’ Dr Latimer said.

Together with the study’s lead investigator, Professor Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University, he found the partial cranium was covered in a patina of minerals produced by the wet conditions of the cave.  

The patina allowed experts from the Geological Survey of Israel to use uranium-thorium dating technique, which determined that the skull was between 50,000 and 60,000 years old.

Dr Latimer said that the skull contained a relatively small brain of around 1,100 millilitres. The modern human brain averages around 1,400 millilitres in comparison.

He explained that several features of the cranium resemble a modern man’s skull, such as the lack of the occipital bun – a bony formation on the back of the skull.

Because the skull is from an adult, CWRU researchers know it is not related to other sub-adult human teeth and bones also found in the cave (pictured)

‘It has been suspected that modern man and Neanderthals (illustrated) were in the same place at the same time, but we didn't have the physical evidence. Now we do have it in the new skull fossil,’ said palaeontologist Bruce Latimer

While its purpose is unknown, Neanderthals had the bun, which resembles a bony hot dog bun with a groove down the centre, but modern humans do not.

The Manot Cave fossil's gender is unknown because it is missing the brow ridge - one marker for gender differences.

The skull was discovered in 2008 by cave explorers who had abseiled through a newly opened roof. An archaeologist using the route is shown

Because the skull is from an adult, CWRU researchers know it is not related to other sub-adult human teeth and bones also found in the cave.

Dr Mark Hans from the university, said: ‘This leads us to believe that there are likely more fossils in the cave where other bones associated with the skull might be found.’

The skull was discovered in 2008 by cave explorers who had abseiled through a newly opened roof of the previously unknown cave, which had been sealed for 30,000 years and an excavation programme followed.

Commenting on the find, Professor Chris Stringer, Research Leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum, said: ‘In terms of its shape, this braincase portion clearly represents a modern human, and closely resembles the skulls of European “Cro-Magnons,” though for an adult individual it is a very small and gracile (presumably a female).

‘Without accompanying DNA data it is impossible to say whether the Manot skull contains Neanderthal DNA from an interbreeding event, but its resemblance to Cro-Magnons (who like recent Europeans retained a small percentage of Neanderthal DNA) and to recent Africans (who on average have much less Neanderthal DNA), suggests that any Neanderthal influence on its skull shape is minimal.

‘Manot might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the hypothesised out-of-Africa event about 60,000 years ago, a population whose descendants ultimately spread right across Asia, and also into Europe.

‘Its discovery raises hopes of more complete specimens from this critical region and time period.’

Yesterday it was announced that fishermen working off the coast of Taiwan have dredged up the jawbone of an ancient human ancestor that lived in the area around 200,000 years ago.

The short, thick mandible has unusually large teeth and a strong jaw compared to other human fossils found in East Asia, according to anthropologists.

The discovery suggests that it belonged to a previously unknown ancient human lineage.

The fossilised lower jawbone (above) was dredged up in a fishing net 15 miles off the west coast of Taiwan

Experts say it means that there may have been several species of early human living in Asia until modern humans arrived 55,000 years ago.

The bone was was dredged up in a fishing net from the Penghu submarine channel, about 15 miles (25km) off the west coast of Taiwan.

Anthropologists from the National Museum of Natural Science in Taiwan and the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who studied the newly discovered fossils say it is unlike any of the other fossilised ancient humans that spread throughout Asia.

Homo erectus, remains of which have been found in Java, Indonesia, and mainland China, tended to have much narrower jawbones and smaller teeth.

The Penghu mandible (centre) found off the coast of Taiwan is much larger than the lower jawbones of Homo erectus from Java (left) and China (right), despite its much younger age according to the researchers

Researchers say that this suggests the robust-jawed 'Penghu man' had a different evolutionary origin from the 'classic' Homo erectus found in the area.

It could mean that it is either an entirely new species or a rare subgroup of Homo erectus.

Dr. Yousuke Kaifu, an anthropologist at the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo who was involved in the study, told MailOnline: 'It is a well-preserved mandible - a small fragment but contains a lot of information useful to evaluate its evolutionary position.

'What we can say is that it is clearly different from the known Homo erectus populations from northern China and Java, and likely represent a group that has been so far unrecognized so.'

He added that the species would have looked very different from modern humans.

The Penghu Channel (seen above), where the jawbone was found, was once been part of mainland Asia
