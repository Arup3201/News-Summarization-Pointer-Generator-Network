The paedophile brother of Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was told he had committed the greatest breach of trust imaginable as he was jailed for 16 years for raping his daughter.

Liam Adams, 58, from west Belfast, showed no visible sign of remorse as a judge passed sentence in Belfast Crown Court, shaking his head occasionally during the hearing and then smiling and laughing as he was led from the dock.

As his crimes were committed at a time when offenders in Northern Ireland were still eligible for 50 per cent remission on jail terms - a policy that has since been reformed - Adams is set to be released after spending eight years behind bars.

The former youth worker was found 
guilty last month of a string of vile sexual assaults on his child Aine 
Dahlstrom when she was aged between four and nine in the late 1970s and 
early 1980s.

The 
40-year-old, who has waived her right to anonymity, wiped tears from her
 eyes as she watched on from the public gallery of court 14 as her 
father found out the length of the jail term awaiting him.

Handing
 down the sentence, which comprised 16 years in custody and a further 
two years on probation, Judge Corinne Philpott said Adams's continued 
refusal to admit his guilt was still denying his daughter the closure 
she sought.

'It has been 
clear throughout that Mrs Dahlstrom simply wanted an acknowledgement 
from her father that what he had done to her during her childhood was 
wrong,' she said.

'He has always denied her this acknowledgement and continues to do so.

'However she now at least knows that the jury must have found her evidence compelling as they believed her.'

The
 judge added: 'This case involved the greatest breach of trust 
imaginable where a father instead of caring for and protecting his 
daughter himself abused her.'

During the trial Ms Dahlstrom gave graphic details of the abuse, which started when she was aged four

Liam
 Adams, from Bernagh Drive, was found guilty of 10 offences against his 
daughter - three counts of rape, four of indecent assault and three of 
gross indecency.

The abuse was committed over a five-year period between 1977 and 1981.

Bespectacled
 Adams, dressed in brown jacket, jeans and blue checked shirt, supported
 himself with a walking stick as he stood to hear his sentence.

His
 convictions have heaped pressure on his high-profile older brother to 
explain why he did not alert the authorities to the abuse allegations 
when he first learned of them.

During
 a first trial earlier this year, which collapsed, the Sinn Fein leader,
 now a public representative in the Irish Republic, claimed he first 
heard of the sex abuse claims in 1987 and, 13 years later, his younger 
brother admitted his guilt to him while the pair were walking in the 
rain.

The former west Belfast MP faced criticism for not informing police about the alleged confession for another nine years.

Police
 Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officers recommended the Public 
Prosecution Service (PPS) take no case against the Sinn Fein veteran.

Northern
 Ireland's police ombudsman is now investigating if detectives properly 
examined whether Gerry Adams covered up the crimes and the PSNI has 
pledged to review the case. Northern Ireland's attorney general John 
Larkin is examining the role of prosecutors.

Gerry
 Adams, who was not in court today, instead attending the funeral of 
well known priest Alec Reid in west Belfast, has insisted he committed 
no offence and accused political rivals of exploiting a family issue to 
attack him.

Ahead of passing sentence, Judge Philpott outlined details of his brother's crimes.

Three
 of the convictions relate to an incident in May 1978 when he raped and 
further sexually abused his daughter when her mother was in hospital 
giving birth to her younger brother.

The judge said Adams would warn his daughter that if she told on him he would be sent to jail.

'Mrs
 Dahlstrom told the court in the evidence that even as a young child she
 had an understanding that what was happening was wrong but that she did
 not understand why her father was doing it to her,' she said.

Ms Philpott said he committed the abuse when he was angry, sometimes drunk and sometimes sober.

'She remembers the smell of his breath when he had taken drink and he was pressing down on her chest,' the judge told the court.

Mrs
 Dahlstrom first brought the matter to police in 1987. This was in the 
midst of the Northern Ireland Troubles and a time when many people in 
republican communities distrusted and refused to co-operate with the 
security forces.

She did not
 pursue the matter at that stage, claiming that detectives were more 
interested to hear information about her famous uncle than about the 
allegations she was levelling against her father.

It
 would not be for another 20 years before she went to police again, 
after finding out that her father was working in a west Belfast youth 
club that her children attended.

As
 well as spending two years on probation at the end of his prison 
sentence, Adams will be placed on the sex offenders register 
indefinitely and will be barred from working with children.

Among
 the aggravating factors the judge took into account when passing 
sentence were the age of the victim, the horrific nature of the crimes, 
and the continuing impact on Mrs Dahlstrom.

She
 said the victim had described how the abuse impacted on her education, 
affecting her concentration and motivation in the classroom, while in 
later life she has found herself being overprotective when it came to 
her own children. Ms Philpott said the trial had also taken its toll on 
Mrs Dahlstrom and recalled how her evidence had to be delayed at one 
stage after she developed chest pains.

Another aggravating factor was the major breach of trust committed, the judge said.

Ms
 Philpott added: 'The evidence has established in the view of this court
 that he used this child for his own sexual gratification, whenever he 
had the opportunity when her mother was not present in the house.'

She
 said the only mitigating factors were his poor health - he suffers from
 both inflammation of the arteries (temporal arteritis) and 
osteoarthritis, a lack of significant previous criminal record, and the 
fact that no evidence of further sexual offending since 1981 had 
emerged.

Mrs Dahlstrom did not make a public comment on the sentence as she left the court.
