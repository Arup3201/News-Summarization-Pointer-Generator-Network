A businesswoman was horrified to discover everyone believed she had died after a rumour spread that she had 'dropped down dead' after getting drunk at the bingo.

Trisha Meikle had returned home from work to be showered with hugs by tearful neighbours who had heard that she had tragically died earlier that day.

The 52-year-old's friends had even started a whip-round for her funeral expenses after being told the she had dropped down dead.

Trisha Meikle, 52, a businesswoman from Neath, South Wales was horrified to discover a rumour had spread on Facebook that she had died

Airport shuttle owner Ms Meikle had to assure her friends and neighbours she was still very much alive after the Facebook rumour got out of control in Neath, South Wales.

She said: 'The rumour was I had gone to bingo, got drunk, went home and dropped down dead - I don't even drink.

'I even heard that in Neath market they were having a whip-round for my funeral.

'My next door neighbour came up to me and hugged me. She said: 'I heard that you had died!'

'I'm going away on holiday next week - I'm lucky it didn't happen then as I'm away for a week.'

Ms Meikle believes the rumour was spread by a business rival who wanted to damage her airport shuttle company

The successful businesswoman said rumours had spread throughout the town and her friend had written a Facebook message saying how sad he was - which then spread like wildfire.

Trisha said she thinks the death rumour could have been started by a business rival trying to kill off her flourishing airport shuttle business.

She said: 'I'm absolutely fuming. I haven't been able to sleep all night. I am going to see my solicitor about this.'

Trisha assured customers that there are 'no problems' with her transport company and they should get in contact if they have any concerns. 

Ms Meikle said a man she knows has since come forward and apologised for making the posts on Facebook.
