Paul Lambert will bring Darren Bent back in from the cold next season after owner Randy Lerner made it clear the Aston Villa manager must use all players at his disposal.

The move represents a remarkable turnaround for the striker who was frozen out at Villa and part of the so-called Bomb Squad training separately from the first-team.

Villa tried to offload Bent last summer but could not find any team to match their £8million valuation and in the end agreed a season-long loan move with Fulham, who picked up his £65,000 per week wages.

Back in the fold: Darren Bent will return to Astonb Villa after being under-used by Paul Lambert

Road to recovery: Charles N'Zogbia is also expected to play a bigger part after being sidelined by injury

He scored six goals in 30 appearances 
but was an infrequent starter and displaced towards the end of the 
season by 19-year-old Cauley Woodrow. The 30-year-old’s return reflects 
the difficulty Lambert will have in making signings during the transfer 
window this summer with the club up for sale and uncertainty about the 
future.

Charles N’Zogbia is 
another who should be back in contention for selection after missing the
 entirety of last season with an Achilles injury and then failing to get
 fit, while Alan Hutton will also return if a buyer cannot be found.

Lambert’s
 previous tactic was to jettison those players on big wages he felt were
 of little benefit to team harmony but Lerner wants to see money he has 
spent on the pitch with Bent the prime example. He arrived at Villa for 
an initial £18m in January 2011 and still has a year left on his 
contract. Given Christian Benteke is out with an Achilles injury 
until October at the earliest and Libor Kozak still needing to fully 
recover from a broken leg Villa’ s striker situation is critical.

Bent
 was nicknamed ‘The Mailman’ by Lerner three years ago because he 
‘always delivered’ but the goals dried up and his attitude was 
questioned.

Lambert said: 
‘Everyone is even now. Everyone is level. That’s what you can do. It’s 
publicly known what’s happened and everyone is on a level playing field.
 The only uncertainty is the main one – how long does it take to get 
sold?’ He added: ‘Christian is doing well, we had one of the physios 
over there last Tuesday to see how he was. An injury like that is a 
nightmare for him, especially the Achilles but he’s doing OK. It’s still
 too early to judge how far away he is.’

Italian job: Tom Ince wants to follow in his father's footsteps by moving to Inter Milan

Meanwhile, Tom Ince has spoken about his ‘dream’ opportunity to  follow in father Paul’s footsteps and join Inter Milan.

Ince, who can leave Blackpool for a nominal fee, said: ‘It is unbelievable to be mentioned with them… it really is dreams.

‘There are options there but I haven’t ruled out staying in England.’
