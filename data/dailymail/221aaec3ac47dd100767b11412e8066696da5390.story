A mystery couple who tip-toed into a stranger's flat to have sex were caught on camera by neighbours who filmed their walk of shame.

The couple, who had been drinking, were at a party in Hackney, east London, on Saturday evening when they fancied some time alone.

They sneaked into Sean Thorne's flat nearby after his friends left the door open and made themselves at home in his bedroom.

'Sex burglars': This couple sneaked into a stranger's flat for some alone time and by the time they were ready to leave the residents had arrived home and filmed the whole incident, including their walk of shame

However, when they started getting carried away flatmate Chris Sawyer, 27, and his friends began filming as they waited for the unknown pair to appear. 

They even alerted Mr Thorne, who was away that weekend, to keep him in the loop about the unwanted guests in his bed.

The group of five friends are seen talking to camera, wondering what to do about the couple who have now been branded the 'sex burglars'.

Surprised: This housemate said on camera: 'Essentially what's happened is we've all got back from a nice evening out and then rudely awaken by two people having the intercourse in our house. Do they live here? No'

Wondering what they're doing: Another flat mate waits outside the bedroom door after the couple made themselves at home in the flat

Explaining the bizarre situation, one housemate says: 'Essentially what's happened is we've all got back from a nice evening out and then rudely awaken by two people having the intercourse in our house. Do they live here? No.'

The housemates clapped as the pair emerged and sheepishly made their way down the stairs.

The couple's red-faced walk of shame was filmed and then posted online sparking a Twitter storm. 

Mr Thorne, 24, who has thrown away his bedsheets after returning to the house, said: 'At first I thought it was a wind-up but then I saw the tweets and video online.

'I’ve got his red trousers as he took mine by mistake. I think it’s quite funny now.'

One Twitter user posted: 'This takes the walk of shame 2 a whole new level #SexBurglars.'
