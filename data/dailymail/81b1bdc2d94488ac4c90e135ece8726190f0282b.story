The leftover beef trimmings derisively known as 'pink slime' is making a comeback two years after a series of graphic news broadcasts devastated sales.

Two of the largest makers of the ground beef product are reporting a rebound in customers thanks in part to rising prices of its higher-quality counterparts.

Average ground beef prices have jumped 10 per cent this year to an all-time high
 of $3.808 per pound in April, according to the Bureau of Labor.

The ground beef product derisively known as pink slime is seeing a turnaround in sales at two of its biggest producers

Cargill Inc's sales of finely textured beef have tripled since March 2012, and the agriculture company now has about 400 customers for the product, which is made from trimmings that have been separated from fat and treated with ammonia or citric acid to kill pathogens, the Lincoln Journal Star reported on Saturday.

That's more customers than Minneapolis-based Cargill had before the controversy erupted after ABC News aired a series of reports on the meat, prompting a consumer backlash, according to Cargill director of communications Mike Martin. Sales, however, are still 40 per cent below their peak, he said.

Jeremy Jacobsen, a spokesman for Beef Products Inc, which dubs its meat 'lean finely textured beef', also confirmed a sales boost. Both companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Mr Jacobsen said his lawyers advised him not to comment further pending the outcome of the Dakota Dunes, South Dakota-based company's $1.2billion defamation lawsuit against ABC, which accused the network of misleading consumers into thinking the product is unsafe.

ABC News, owned by The Walt Disney Co, denied BPI's claims and vowed to fight the lawsuit. Last month the South Dakota Supreme Court ruled that the lawsuit could proceed to the discovery phase.

The
 meat industry's use of ammonium-treated beef trimmings in school 
lunches and fast food restaurants was little known until 2009, when The 
New York Times reported on the product and publicized use of the term 
'pink slime'.

The product, trimmed from leftover fatty parts 
and treated to kill bacteria, was fast becoming a staple of grocery 
stores, fast food joints such as McDonald's and Burger King and the US' 
school lunch program, which purchased 7 million pounds worth in 2012.

The USDA gave it a clean bill of health, considering it almost safer than regular ground beef.

Critics of the product object to the use of ammonia to treat the meat, a food safety practice
 used for decades and that meets federal food safety standards.

The term 'pink slime' gained traction after it was used in a New York Times story in 2009.

Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver also joined the anti-pink slime cause, railing against it on his cooking show. McDonald's and 
other fast food companies stopped using it, and major supermarket chains
 including Kroger and Stop & Shop vowed to stop selling beef with 
the low-cost product.

An online petition calling for the banning of the product from school menus drew hundreds of thousands of supporters.

Schools slashed their use of the meat 
product by 94 per cent during the 12 months ended September 2013 to 392,000 from
 at least 7 million pounds in the previous fiscal year, according to 
Bloomberg News, which cited US Department of Agriculture data.

Only Iowa, 
Nebraska and South Dakota were still ordering ground beef with the 
product in 2012.

As a result of the sudden drop in sales, Beef Products fired about 750 employees and closed three of its four plants. At least one company, AFA Foods, declared bankruptcy.

'The result of that has been catastrophic for this company,' Craig Letch, BPI's 
director of food-quality assurance, said in December 2012. The company lost 80 per cent of 
its business in 28 days.
