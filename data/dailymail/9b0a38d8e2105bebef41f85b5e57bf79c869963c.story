A 96-year-old man has described the terrifying moment a robber threw him to the ground in the car park of a Nevada casino.

Louis Waxman, who uses a walker to get around, said he never saw his attacker, who left him bleeding on the ground on October 31.

Police are trying to trace a young man who was spotted following Mr Waxman as he left the Sunset Station Casino in Henderson after watching a show at about 4pm.

'I put my walker in the trunk, walked 
towards the driver’s seat. That’s when he pounced on me,' Mr Waxman told KTLA. 'I
went down in a heap.'

'I was face-down on the ground. He was smacking my head against the cement. And I started to bleed all over,' he added.

Police have not said what the robber took from his victim, but Mr Waxman has said the 'amount is immaterial'.

He managed to crawl to his car after the attack and, despite being disorientated, tried to drive home. A police officer got him to a hospital after pulling him over and seeing the extent of his injuries.

Police are trying to trace a man they suspect may have been responsible for the attack. He was seen wearing shorts and a beanie hat, and talking on a cell phone as he left the casino.

Beaten: Louis Waxman has been left with two black eyes and bruising

Strong willed: Louis Waxman is staying with his daughter Reva, left, while he recovers but the 96-year-old has already returned to the casino

He has been left with two black eyes and bruises on his arms, but a defiant Mr Waxman, who was left with a limp after catching polio as a child, has already returned to the casino, KCAL9 reported.

Mr Waxman, who celebrates his 97th 
birthday next week, is recovering from his injuries at the home of his 
daughter, Reva Sander.

She said: 'It should never happen to anyone and certainly not to seniors who are the most vulnerable.'
