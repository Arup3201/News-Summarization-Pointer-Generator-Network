The Royal Air Force Museum is set to open a new permanent exhibition to commemorate the role British airmen and aircraft played during the First World War.

The First World War in the Air exhibition, which opens a week today, will tell the incredible stories of men and women who served and protected our nation with the air force.

Set in a Grade II listed building which was used as an aircraft factory for First World War planes, the exhibition shows off the RAF Museum's staggering collection of British and German planes, archive film, photographs and wartime paraphernalia to show just how vital the air force was for Britain during the Great War.

The RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London, is set to  a new permanent First World War exhibition next week, with British and German fighter planes on display

The exhibition, which will include replicas of the Albatros D.Va - used by the Germans - commemorate the role of British airmen and aircraft during WWI

The Albatros D.Va was first built in 1917, with around 2,500 of the fighters used during the First World War by the Luftstreitkräfte - the German air force

The First World War in the Air exhibition, which opens a week today, will also display British planes such as the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 

Set in a Grade II listed building which was used as an aircraft factory for First World War planes, the exhibition shows off the RAF Museum's staggering collection of planes

Visitors will be able to marvel at replicas of classic war planes such as the Albatros D.Va and the Sopwith Camel - aircraft which did battle against each other for the Germans and Allies respectively between 1914 and 1918.

The exhibition takes place at the RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London, which has been described as the 'birthplace of aerial power'.

The site's long and rich history started in 1862, when British flight enthusiast Henry Coxwell took a short flight in a hot air balloon from a field where the museum now stands.

The plot passed through the hands of The London Aerodrome Company before it was sold to aviation pioneer Claude Grahame-White in 1911, who oversaw the site's pivotal role in the development of air power and pilots for both the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps who trained there.

In just 10 years, driven by the requirements of the conflict, aviation technology developed from being barely able to cross the English Channel in 1909 to crossing the Atlantic in 1919.

The exhibition, designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, explores what it was like to be involved in the earliest days of military aviation through the story of Britain's air services, the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service. 

The exhibition, which marks the centenary of the First World War, also houses a series of portraits of crew, paying tribute to the thousands who gave their lives in the Royal Flying Corps

Britain's air power expanded massively during the First World War, from barely 2,000 in the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service in 1914 to 290,000 in the RAF after the war

These two organisations merged on April 1 1918 to create the Royal Air Force - the first national air service in existence. 

Fascinating displays incorporate the experiences of pilots, ground crew and factory workers to help tell the story of the beginnings of military flight. 

Exhibits include iconic aircraft such as the Sopwith Camel, the Fokker D VII and an example of an aircraft that was built in the factory at Colindale, the Avro 504 - the most-produced plane during WWI.  

The thrilling story of the evolution of flight, from the early days of experimentation to full-force fighting machines, is underpinned by stories of people 'on the ground'. 

The exhibition also explores the extraordinary expansion of Britain's air services, the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, from 1,800 men in 1914 to a Royal Air Force of 290,000 men and women at the end of the war in 1918.

Historical documents, such as First World War casualty cards, casualty forms and muster rolls, are likely to interest genealogists and people trying to track down relatives' actions during the 1914-1918 war. It can be viewed at www.rafmuseumstoryvault.com.

Karen Whitting, director of public programmes at the Royal Air Force Museum, said: '100 years on from the outbreak of the First World War, the narrative of our First World War in the Air exhibition resonates locally, nationally and internationally. 

'The Museum, therefore, looks forward to sharing this incredible story with both local visitors and audiences from across the globe. It is particularly fitting that we mark this anniversary in the approach to 2018, the centenary of the founding of the Royal Air Force.'

Blondel Cluff, Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund London Committee, said: 'Thanks to lottery players, this new permanent exhibition means that the RAF Museum will be able to play a full part in marking the centenary of the First World War, bringing to the fore an important but currently less well known aspect of the War.'

The First World War in the Air exhibition was funded by a £898,558 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
