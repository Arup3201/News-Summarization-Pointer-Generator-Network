At least 52 dogs have died after being struck down by an horrific kidney disease, vets have warned.

In the first recorded outbreak of Alabama rot to be reported in Britain, dogs have fallen ill and died up and down the country.

Pet owners are warned to look out for lesions on their dogs' legs as vets continue to search for the cause of the disease.

The disease was unknown in this country until November 2012, when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the New Forest, Hampshire

Outbreaks of Alabama rot, which attacks blood vessels in the skin and kidneys, have affected dogs in the US as long ago as the 1980s.

But the disease was unknown in this country until November 2012, when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the New Forest, Hampshire.

The results of an investigation into the outbreak, published last night in the journal Veterinary Record, reveal the full horror of the disease.

Although the initial cases were reported in Hampshire, incidents have since been confirmed across England and Wales, from Somerset in the South West to County Durham in the North East.

Unlike the US cases, which have only affected greyhounds, the British outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds.

It has affected English springer spaniels, flat coated retrievers, whippets, Labradors - dogs of all shapes and sizes from a cocker spaniel to a Doberman.

There have been 103 suspected incidents reported by vets, lead researcher David Walker told the Daily Mail last night, although only 52 of those have been confirmed by postmortem examinations.

All those dogs died - either killed by the disease or put down by their vets.

Unlike the US cases, which have only affected greyhounds, the British outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds, including this retriever Erin who died from the disease

Mr Walker, a vet who practises in Hampshire, said the team's investigation had not established why the disease had so suddenly sprung up, how it had arrived in Britain, or why certain dogs had been affected.

But he warned pet owners to remain alert to symptoms.

'The main message is that we are still seeing cases spring up. Although the numbers are relatively small, continued vigilance is the best thing. People should look out for skin lesions when the dog hasn't obviously been cut on something.'

He admitted much remains unknown about the problem.

'We don't know whether this is a condition that has been in the UK for a while, but just was unrecognised, or whether it had recently emerged,' he said.

One of the many dogs struck down the disease was Tegan, a three-year-old fox terrier cross, who died in February 2014 after walking near Ashurst in the New Forest.

The scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus, or whether the problem was genetic - this spaniel, Jess, died of the disease

Her owner Sarah Thairs, of North Baddesley, Hampshire, took her to the vet but her condition worsened and Tegan died soon afterwards.

She said at the time: 'My poor little girl had been through so much.

'Tests showed the disease had gone to her pancreas. I had to make the decision to put her down, which is heartbreaking.'

The investigation found no obvious link between any of the dogs - even those who became ill within a few days in the New Forest.

Mr Walker said: 'When we looked at all their walking routes and other factors, we could find nothing in common.'

The results rule out early theories that the dogs had been poisoned by contaminated food.

They also ruled out a link to the E.coli shiga toxin, another early theory.

The scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus, or whether the problem was genetic.

They are comparing it to a similar human disease of the kidneys, called Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome, which is genetic but can be caused by exposure to certain medications, to see whether it can offer any clues.
