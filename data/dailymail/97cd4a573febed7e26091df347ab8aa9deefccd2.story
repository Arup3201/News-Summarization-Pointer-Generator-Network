At least two people are dead from a Monday morning explosion and partial building collapse at an Omaha animal feed processing plant, dozens more are missing or hospitalized.

Officials confirmed two deaths but fear many of the 21 unaccounted for people in the Industrial Nutrition factory may also have perished. An additional 10 workers were hospitalized with varying degrees of injuries.

As many as 38 employees were reportedly inside the plant when the explosion occurred around 10am.

Interim Omaha Fire Chief Bernie 
Kanger said rescue workers were dealing with 'extreme conditions' and that the situation 'continues to be very dangerous'.

Kanger during a Monday afternoon press conference that there had been deaths
 but said official figures will not be released until the plant has been
 cleared and the respective families notified.

No hazardous chemicals were on the premises, Kanger said.

One 50-year-old man taken was 
taken to hospital in a critical condition and was described as suffering
 from possible hypothermia, according to Omaha.com.

Paramedics said the man had been submerged in cold water after an object fell on him.

At least one other man was being treated by hospital workers after inhaling limestone dust.

The Nebraska Medical Center was treating four men who work at the plant, according to spokeswoman Jenny Nowatzke: a 37-year-old with a collapsed lung, a 38-year-old with minor injuries, a 50-year-old with hypothermia, a 30-year-old with minor injuries.

In addition, a firefighter that arrived at the scene needed stitches in a hand.

Three patients sent to Alegent Creighton were listed in critical, serious and fair conditions.

Three others were taken to Bergan Mercy Medical Center, with their conditions unknown.

'We saw burns. Two patients had burns on their hands. One also had burns on their face. They were the first two that were brought into us,' a hospotal spokesperson said.

'The other patient that came in was actually, I think, crushed under some of the falling debris. He has rib fractures and a collapsed lung and obviously is in a significant amount of pain,' the spokesperson added.

Extra doctors were called in to treat the plant's injured, the spokesperson noted.

Seven refused treatment, according to Kanger, who said an additional 21 are dead or unaccounted for.

A witness told KETV he ran as soon as he heard a noise.

'I just heard a crack pop and big ball of fire, and I just took off running when I heard the first crack,' said worker Jamar White. 'That's all I could do was get out of the way and make sure I was OK.'

Another employee told the station of his horrifying escape.

'I heard the explosion and stuff started falling, so I ducked for cover,' Nate Lawis said. "'t was pitch black in there. All I could see was fire. I had to feel my way out of the place. I couldn't see anything.'

Workers were being released from the scene of the accident around 1 p.m.

Dozens of panicked family members had gathered outside the plant after hearing of the explosion.

Some had received cellphone calls and texts from their loved ones inside who told them one or two people may be missing or trapped.

Kari Cook struggled to fight back tears as she waited for news on her boyfriend, John Broderick, a 53-year-old shift supervisor.

He sent her a text at 10.09 am saying: 'Major accident. I'm hurt and trapped. Love you.'

Cook thought Broderick was joking.

'Honey, answer me,' she replied.

He never responded.

Within minutes, she was among the hordes of people gathered in the car park awaiting news.

Mary Brown said she'd heard nothing about the accident until she got a text from her son, Jake Wolfe: 'I'm OK.'

She said she texted back and forth a few times with Wolfe, 25, before he lost service on his phone.

She later talked to him briefly.

'He's pretty shaken up,' she said, crying.

'They're all friends there.'

Larry McElhinney, a driver with Curry's Transportation Service Inc. of Muscatine, Iowa, was making a delivery to International Nutrition when the explosion happened.

He said he was sitting in his truck just outside the plant when he heard debris hitting the roof of his cab and saw dust flying.

'The next thing I knew the wall was caving in,' he told The Journal Star.

'I just got out of the truck and went out where everybody else was at.'

According to International Nutrition's website, the company has operated globally for more than 20 years and in the United States for more than 40, working with animal health distributors, feed manufacturers and producers.

An Occupational Health and Safety Administration report indicates a worker died at the plant on Aug. 30, 2002, after falling into a 5-foot deep by 20-foot long mixing tank that had an auger conveyor running through the center of it.

The machine was running while the worker cleaned it, and he was mutilated by the moving auger conveyor and killed, the OSHA report says.

Normal procedure for cleaning the tank required that it be locked out and the person washing it to jog the auger conveyor to clean all surfaces.

The company paid $13,600 to settle seven related OSHA complaints.  

In 2012, the company paid more than $10,000 to settle half a dozen OSHA complaints informally for a variety of alleged safety violations.

The categories included storage, first aid availability, safety guards on machinery, hand-power tool protection and electrical systems coverings. 

Plant officials have so far declined to comment
