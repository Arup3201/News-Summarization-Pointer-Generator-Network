An art college has refused to take down a 'disgusting' painting showing Jimmy Savile dressed as a knight in shining armour.

The image, painted by a former student, is hung prominently in South Staffordshire College where it can be seen by the college's students.

But despite complaints from a member of staff, and concerns expressed by pupils, the college defended exhibiting the image and said it is 'ironic'.

Savile the knight: The painting shows Jimmy Savile, thought to be Britain's worst ever peadophile, dressed in shining armour

The image, which shows Savile standing in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House, with his trademark cigar hanging out of his mouth, is hung up in an exhibition space at a campus in Lichfield, Staffordshire.

The viewing space, known as the Wedge gallery, is open to members of the public as well as students at the college.

Students at the college today said that the work has 'split opinion' in the college, while an Art lecturer has claimed the piece is ironic, and said a caption will be added to 'explain the thinking behind it'.

Tutors at the school refused to remove the painting after a cleaner complained when the painting made it on to the walls.

Hannah Mattison, 24, first saw the image in storage last week at the college's Â£3million School of 
Art, Design and Media facility, and spoke out when it was put on display.

Prominent:

She said: 'I first saw it when I was cleaning an art room and it was stacked in a corner.

'I
was offended but I didn't say anything because it was in a closed-off 
area, but after they moved it to a public area I felt I had to say 
something.I was disgusted when I saw it up there.

'The head of art won't say who did it because they are a student. He won't take it down and says it is a piece of art and people will interpret it in different ways.

'I worry what affect it could have if a young person who's being abused themselves saw it. They haven't portrayed Savile as a nasty paedophile but as a kind of hero wearing a suit of armour.

'He is not a hero or icon - he's a serial abuser of children and to show him as anything else is wrong.'

Today students at the college said that the painting 'split opinion' and should be taken down.

Notorious: Since Savile died in 2011, dozens of victims have come forward to say he abused them

One, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It does split opinion in the college. Some people think it's distasteful but some think it's interesting. It causes a debate and I guess that's the point of art in many ways.'

Another said: 'I think they probably should take it down now everything has come out about him. It's in the corridor not even in a room so you can't avoid it if you go to the art department.

'They say Savile had hundreds of victims so it's possible a family member of someone affected by him will come to this college. I don't think they would want to see a giant portrait of him grinning like that.'

However, the college defended its decision to display the painting by saying that it is intended to be ironic.

It released a statement saying: 'The artwork in question is intended to be an ironic comment on organisations that ignore or cover up important issues, going some way to explain why Jimmy Savile's abuse continued undetected for so many years.

'It has received a number of positive comments on this basis and one expression of concern, from a member of South Staffordshire College's non-teaching staff.

Controversial: The exterior of South Staffordshire College's campus in Lichfield, where the portrait is on display

'The person in question has now had the opportunity to discuss the artwork and the college has assured her that the well-being and safeguarding of its learners are at the very heart of its activities, indeed this is one of the concepts behind the painting."

Mr Nash, an Art lecturer at the college, added: 'The purpose of exploring these issues is in enabling discussions to take place rather than allowing them to be swept under the carpet.

'As an additional safeguard we are creating a caption for the piece which will explain the thinking behind it.'

South Staffordshire college, which was given a 'good' rating in its last Ofsted inspection, has around 6,000 students across its four campuses and caters for leaners as young as 14.

The gallery - named the Wedge Gallery - is said to exhibit the work of 'professional artists and emerging designers.'
