Celtic have completed the loan signing of Ghana winger Mubarak Wakaso.

The 24-year-old, who played in the World Cup, arrives on a one-year loan deal with Celtic having the option to buy the player from Russian side Rubin Kazan.

Celtic announced the former Espanyol and Villarreal player will go straight into their squad for Sunday's Scottish Premiership clash at Dundee.

Wakaso's signing has been in the pipeline for more than a week but was held up by work-permit issues.

In the meantime, Celtic were knocked out of the Champions League following a 2-1 aggregate defeat by Slovenians Maribor, which sent the Glasgow club into the Europa League group stage.

That defeat might have an impact on their bid to buy Sporting Gijon and Serbia forward Stefan Scepovic.

Scepovic has been quoted as saying he has several options other than Celtic, including PSV Eindhoven, but Hoops manager Ronny Deila said after Wednesday night's home defeat by Maribor that discussions were ongoing.
