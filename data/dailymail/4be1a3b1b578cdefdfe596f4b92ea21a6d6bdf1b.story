Chinese youths should challenge authority and reject conformity, US Vice President Joe Biden said today.

Mr Biden took a stand for the American mindset shortly after arriving in China for a two-day visit, as he addressed a group of visa applicants at the US Embassy in Beijing.

The Vice President urged Chinese exchange students to challenge their government, teachers and religious leaders, and take inspiration from the attitude of young Americans.

Challenging authority: Vice President Joe Biden told a group of visa applicants at the US Embassy that they should learn from American youths during their visit and reject orthodoxy 

‘Children in America are rewarded - 
not punished - for challenging the status quo,’ Mr Biden told a group of Chinese citizens waiting to get visitor visas at the US Embassy.

‘The only 
way you make something totally new is to break the mold of what was 
old.’

The vice president 
seemed to be alluding to the authoritarian rule of China's government as
 he described a liberal and permissive intellectual culture in the 
United States.

Biden thanked the group for wanting to visit the United States and added that he hoped their visit would teach them that ‘innovation can only occur where you can breathe free.’

‘I hope you observe it when you're there,’ The Vice President added. ‘From the beginning of our country, it's a constant stream of new immigrants, new cultures, new ideas, new religions, brand new people continuing to reinvigorate the spirit of America.’

Although he held the American system high, he praised China's education.

Yesterday, results from a global exam showed the American students are once again lagging behind many of their Asian and European peers.

Students in Shanghai, China's largest city, had the top scores in all subjects on that exam.

‘Even though some countries' educational systems are better than America's - particularly in grade school - there is one thing that's stamped in the DNA of every American, whether they are naturalized citizens or natural-born,’ Mr Biden said. ‘It's an inherent rejection of orthodoxy.’

This is not the first time Mr Biden has made controversial comments on China and its totalitarian rule.

Earlier this year he told students at the University of Pennsylvania that you can't think differently in a nation where you can't breathe free.

Visiting Chinese students at the university said they were offended and requested an apology.

Later in the afternoon, the Vice President said that US-China relations depend on trust and a positive notion of each other's motives.

Neither leader made public mention of a major clash over disputed airspace that's pitted China against the U.S. and its Asian allies.

Mr Biden said the relationship between the two major powers will significantly affect the course of the 21st century. If the US and China can get that relationship right, the possibilities are limitless, he added.

'Complex relationships require sustained, high-level engagement, and that's why I'm here,', Mr Biden said emerging from a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Absent from the Vice President's comments was any discussion of US concerns over China's new air defense zone. In Tokyo a day earlier, Biden pledged to raise those concerns 'with great specificity' with Xi and other Chinese leaders, adding that China's move was deeply concerning.

'This action has raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation,' Biden said Tuesday after meeting with Japanese President Shinzo Abe, whose government has been on edge for the past two weeks since China unilaterally asserted its authority over airspace above tiny islands that China and Japan both claim.
