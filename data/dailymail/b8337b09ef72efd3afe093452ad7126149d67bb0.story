Google Glass owners will soon be able to broadcast everything they see live online, raising new privacy concerns over the wearable computer.

Livestream says its new app could be used by journalists, and even be worn by athletes during events.

However, the firm admits the new app has major privacy issues - but says the benefits are worth it.

The app uses a user's mobile phone to broadcast what they see live online, via either a cellphone or wifi connection

Google recently revealed the first official etiquette guide for its Glass wearable computer - and admits users have been seen as 'creepy and rude' for wearing the device.

The firm warns users to ask people's permission before recording them, and warns against 'glassing out' where they focus on the screen too much.The guide comes as Google is expanding the number of people who have the $1500 prototypes, ahead of an expected release later this year.'With new technology comes new questions, and our Explorers help to answer those questions,' Google said.

'Since the program started, our Explorers have gotten a lot of attention when they wear Glass out and about.

'Reactions range from the curious – 'Wow! Are those the ‘Google glasses’? How do they work?” – to the suspect – 'Goodness gracious do those things see into my soul?!'

With a simple tap of the device and at the voice command 'OK Glass, Livestream,' Glass users can stream what they are recording to an online audience.

The app is already available on iOS and Android is being used for a multitude of applications including citizen journalism, news coverage, sporting events, concerts and more.

'The possibilities of Livestream for Glass are endless,' CEO Max Haot said in a statement.

'From a reporter covering a protest, to an athlete competing in a sports arena, we believe that Glass will be instrumental in democratizing the future of live video streaming.'

According to co-founder and chief product officer Phil Worthington, the app has been used in the past by citizen journalists to record and live stream major news events.

But the first-person perspective that Glass provides makes the app even more valuable.

However, the glasses could also be used to illegally bootleg concerts, for instance

Livestream was used to provide a live feed Twitter's initial public offering and is used at other big broadcasting companies.

The app allows followers of the stream to post comments that will pop up at the bottom of Glass's interface.

It can also post to Facebook when you begin shooting and will also provide on-demand tape to link once the user is done shooting.

He admitted the new app was controversial.

'Yes, maybe there are privacy concerns, but I think the information it shares with the world is much more valuable than that,' he said.

One of the limitations of the app is its drain on battery power, but Worthington said people dedicated to live streaming can connect an external a battery pack to shoot for longer durations.

With a simple tap of the device and at the voice command 'OK Glass, Livestream,' Glass users can stream what they are recording to an online audience.
