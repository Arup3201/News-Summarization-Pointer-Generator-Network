The cost of running a home in the North of England is £3,000 cheaper than London and the South.

Research reveals the cost of living in the South carries a hefty premium – not least because housing is so much more expensive.

Experts looked at mortgage and rent repayments alongside energy and water bills, household insurance,  council tax and broadband charges to create a cost of living league.

It's cheaper up north: The cost of running a home is cheapest in the north of England, followed by northern Scotland, according to research by the price comparison website MoneySuperMarket.com

Unsurprisingly, the most expensive area was London at an average of £11,536, ahead of the South East at £11,317 and the South West at £10,955.

At the other end of the scale was Northern England at £8,521.

The figures suggest that while much of the wealth may be based in London and the Home Counties, many ordinary families in the South face real pressure to cover their essential bills.

Meanwhile, they show those working in the public sector, such as teachers and nurses – where national pay rates apply – can enjoy a higher quality of life in the North than their counterparts in the South.

Chancellor George Osborne has flirted with the idea of introducing regional pay in the public sector to reflect the differences in living costs, but he has faced fierce opposition from the trade unions.

The figures were compiled by price comparison website MoneySuperMarket.com.

Spokesman Clare Francis said: ‘Mortgage and rent payments are naturally the biggest expenditure for people, and for Londoners this is typically around £7,164 per year.

'That is a stark contrast to those living in South Wales and the North where it costs people £3,000 less to keep a roof over their heads.’

Council tax is the second biggest bill, with those in the South East, at an average of £2,492, paying the most, while families in the North of Scotland get away with just £1,421.

Water bills average £489 across the UK, but households in the South West pay almost double that, with an average of £811 before one-off rebates.

Despite being among the cheapest places to live in the UK, the North of Scotland is the most expensive area for energy bills with average gas and electricity costs of £1,383 per year. By comparison, families in the East Midlands pay  an average of £1,297.

Only Cheshire in the North has higher essential bills than the average for the region. However, the well-heeled Cheshire set – which includes millionaire footballers – are better able to cope than most.

Miss Francis said: ‘With the exception of Cheshire, anyone living or looking to move anywhere south of the Midlands will find they are being hit hardest.’
