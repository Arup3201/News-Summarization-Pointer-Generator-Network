A father whose four young sons could communicate only in grunts when authorities rescued them from a filthy Denver apartment pleaded guilty to felony child abuse on Thursday.

Wayne Sperling, 67, could spend up to seven years in prison when he is sentenced on December 30. He also faced other charges, but these were dropped in exchange for his guilty plea.

He and his wife, Lorinda Bailey, were both charged after their sons, aged two to six, were found in sickening living conditions in their apartment last October. 

The abuse was revealed when an emergency room doctor, who was treating the youngest boy for a cut to his forehead, noticed that he was unwashed, smelled of cigarettes and had bruises consistent with pinching.

Guilty: Wayne Sperling, pictured in November 2013, has pleaded guilty to felony child abuse after his four young sons were found living is sickening conditions last year. He faces up to seven years in prison

Authorities discovered Sperling, his 36-year-old wife and the boys living in an apartment filled with cat feces, urine and flies across every surface inside the house. 

Prosecutors say it one of the most horrific cases they've ever seen, but the state's child abuse laws kept them from pursuing harsher penalties because the boys did not suffer serious physical injuries.

The youngsters were taken in by a foster mother and are improving, prosecutors said.

They have never asked about their parents.

'Considering what they've gone through, they're doing remarkably well,' Denver District Attorney spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough said on Thursday. That the boys are living together has 'helped them in their ability to try to recover from the horrifying neglect they were living in.' 

Sentenced: His wife Lorinda Bailey, 36, pictured last year, was sentenced to 90 days in jail last week

After they were rescued and given bagged lunches to eat, the boys acted as if they hadn't seen normal food before, Detective Teresa Gessler testified in Bailey's case.

They patted the sandwiches and played with the apples and after an adult mimed eating an apple to encourage them to eat, they licked the fruit, she said.

When the boys were placed with the foster mother, prosecutor Bonnie Benedetti said, they did not know how to dress themselves.

Benedetti said they are still not all toilet-trained and their snack cupboard has to be kept locked to prevent them from hoarding food.

The case  warranted felony charges because it was a repeat child-abuse offense.

Cruel: The couple had already lost three children after being accused of child abuse in 2006

The couple, who have a 30-year age gap, lost custody of other children amid similar allegations in October 2006, after passers-by reported two young children playing in the street.

The children mostly grunted and pointed to communicate, and officers found a home full of trash and rotten food.

Bailey and Sperling pleaded guilty in June 2007 to misdemeanor child abuse in that case.

Bailey was sentenced last week to 90 days in jail and five years of probation after pleading guilty.
