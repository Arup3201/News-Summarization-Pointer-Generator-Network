Tearing around the Goodwood motoring circuit in front of a packed crowd waving Union flags, these classic Jaguars could be racing for glory at a 1950s Grand Prix - were it not for the helicopter flying over head capturing the action for a new advertisement.

The fleet of retro Jaguars were filmed as the raced around the historic track near Chichester, West Sussex, as part of a new campaign to promote the manufacturer in China.

And a familiar face was rumoured to be among the drivers, who were kitted out in period costume complete with helmets and goggles as they made their way around the 2.4mile loop - with onlookers suggesting that David Beckham was behind the wheel of one of the cars.

The former footballer is a spokesman for the brand and earlier this month launched the new Jaguar F-Type Coupe at the 13th Beijing International Automotive Exhibition.

Motors running: A fleet of classic Jaguars are filmed from a helicopter as the race around Goodwood motoring circuit for the car firm's new advert

Onlookers: The classic cars tore past what appeared to be a 1950s press pack, kitted out in flat caps and trench coats with their vintage cameras at the ready

On show: The fleet of cars, which included classic D-Types from the 1950s, lapped up the sunshine as they raced around the historic circuit

Venue: Jaguar has also been filming with the classic cars on Westminster Bridge in recent weeks

Star of the show: Onlookers suggested that this driver, his face partially hidden by his helmet and the car's windscreen may have been brand ambassador David Beckham

Star in a (very expensive) car? The former footballer has enjoyed a long association with the luxury car manufacturer and earlier this month launched the latest model in China

History: Cars have been racing at the Goodwood circuit since 1948, and the track was home to the Glover Trophy non-championship Formula One race in the 1950s

Cheering: Bedecked in period costume this crowd of onlookers waved Union flags as they watched the racing, giving an authentic feel to the proceedings

They're off! Jaguar started life as the Swallow Sidecar Company in Blackpool in 1922, before the firm was renamed after World War II

Speed: Throughout its long history Jaguar has enjoyed success in motor racing, particularly in the Le Mans 24 Hours in the 1950s with the C-Type and D-Type cars

Endorsement: David Beckham poses with the brand new Jaguar F-Type Coupe during the Chinese launch event
