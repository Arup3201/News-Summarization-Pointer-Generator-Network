A Mediterranean diet increases life expectancy by protecting the DNA from damage, research shows.

Harvard academics studied 4,676 middle-aged women comparing their typical eating habits with the make-up of their cells.

Importantly, they looked at their telomeres – biological caps which are found at the ends of chromosomes that protect the DNA inside.

The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish and olive oil with little red or processed meat - and may help protect our DNA from damage, new research suggests

As we get older, our telomeres get progressively shorter, causing the DNA to become damaged and raising the odds of age-related illnesses such as Alzheimer' s, diabetes and heart disease.

The research – published in the BMJ – found that women whose diets were generally low in fat and high in fruit and veg had longer telomeres.

But this was even more pronounced for those who followed a Mediterranean diet rich in fruit, veg, nuts and pulses.

Marta Crous-Bou, the lead author from the Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, the US, said that it may be due to antioxidants in fruit, veg and nuts – chemicals that prevent ill health and aging.

She said: 'Our findings showed that healthy eating, overall, was associated with longer telomeres.

'However, the strongest association was observed among women who adhered to the Mediterranean diet.'

Dr Immaculata De Vivo, associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health said: 'Our results further support the benefits of adherence to this diet to promote health and longevity.

'To our knowledge this is the largest population-based study specifically addressing the association between Mediterranean diet adherence and telomere length in healthy, middle-aged women,

'Our results further support the benefits of adherence to this diet to promote health and longevity.'

Previous research by Harvard University last year involving 10,000 showed that women who followed a Mediterranean diet were 40 per cent to live beyond the age of 70.

They were also far less likely to develop chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.

The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains, fish and olive oil with little red or processed meat.

Dr Mike Knapton, Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This large study adds to the body of evidence that longer telomeres are found in those who eat a Mediterranean diet.

'Longer telomeres may partially explain the link between diet and risk of cardiovascular disease.

'Previous findings from the same study had shown that those with unhealthy lifestyles had shorter telomeres.

'These results reinforce our advice that eating a balanced and healthy diet can reduce your risk of developing heart disease.' 

The Mediterranean diet not only improves heart health but it could help male impotence.

Researchers found men with erectile dysfunction who adopted the diet - involving eating fruit, veg, pasta, olive oil and nuts daily but few dairy products or red meat - may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke.

However, patients with erectile dysfunction who failed to stick to the Mediterranean diet had more vascular and cardiac damage.

Greek Doctor Athanasios Angelis, who presented his findings at the annual meeting of the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging in Austria, said: 'Erectile dysfunction is not a symptom of ageing, it is a bad sign from the body that something is wrong with the vasculature.

'In 80 per cent of cases, erectile dysfunction is caused by vascular problems and is a warning that patients are at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke.'

He added: 'The Mediterranean diet is associated with lower cardiovascular events and could be a way to help erectile dysfunction patients lower their risk.

'We wanted to investigate whether patients with erectile dysfunction who follow this diet have less vascular and cardiac damage.'

The study included 75 men with erectile dysfunction, average age 56, who attended the Department of Cardiology at Hippokration Hospital in Athens.

Dr Angelis said: 'Patients with erectile dysfunction who had unhealthy diets had more vascular and cardiac damage than those who followed the Mediterranean diet.

Good sources of monounsaturated fat - such as macadamia nuts - can help men with erectile dysfunction avoid a heart attack 

'Previous studies have shown that patients with erectile dysfunction have vascular damage, but we found that the heart is also damaged. 

'This may help to further explain why these patients are more prone to cardiovascular events.

'The formation of atheroma, the stiffening of the arteries, and the poor functioning of the heart can eventually lead to a cardiac event.'

He added: 'Our findings suggest that adopting the Mediterranean diet can improve the cardiovascular risk profile of patients with erectile dysfunction and may reduce their chances of having a heart attack or stroke. This needs to be tested in a larger study.

'Really simple changes in our diet may help a lot, for example using olive oil which contains monounsaturated fat.

'If someone doesn't have the money to buy some of the foods they can substitute them with others, for example nuts are a good source of monounsaturated fat.

'Sometimes it's difficult to adopt something if you consider that it's part of a prescription, but the Mediterranean diet is not a prescription, it's a lifestyle.

'It's about having an awareness of what foods are healthy or unhealthy.'

He concluded: 'Patients who have erectile dysfunction and don't adhere to the Mediterranean diet have vascular and cardiac damage and are at increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

'Our findings suggest that adopting a healthy diet can reduce that risk. We also advise patients to stop smoking, exercise and ensure that they have healthy levels of blood pressure and lipids.'
