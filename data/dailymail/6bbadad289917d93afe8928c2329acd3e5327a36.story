A man who lost his wife, daughter and five other family members in a car crash after the family's minivan flipped over a Bronx freeway has spoken out about his shock since the tragedy.

Juan Gonzalez discovered yesterday his wife and 10-year-old daughter were among those killed  when she drove off an overpass of the Bronx River Parkway, plummeting 59ft into a remote section of New York's Bronx Zoo.

Forty-five-year-old Maria Gonzalez died instantly in the crash, which claimed the lives of her parents, Jacob Nunez, 85, and Ana Julia Martinez, 81; her sister Maria Nunez, 39'; her 10-year-old daughter Jocelyn Gonzalez; and nieces Niely and Marly Rosario, ages seven and three.

Grandparents: Ana Julia Martinez, 81, and her 85-year-old husband Jacob Nunez died in the horrific crash

In an emotional interview with the New York Daily News, Mr Gonzalez said he was 'destroyed' by the news.

'I don't want to live anymore,' he said.

Mr Gonzalez, a livery cab driver, 
shared a home not far from the crash site with his wife, a maintenance 
worker at Fordham University.

The Daily News reports the couple was working to pay for college for their 18-year-old son, Jonel.

Mr Gonzalez said the family had been to church earlier in the day.

The newspaper reports relatives said 
her sister, Maria Nunez, worked for a school bus company in the Bronx 
and had three daughters.

Tragic: The wreckage of the minivan lies in the grounds of New York's Bronx zoo. Seven people inside the van died after it fell 59ft from a freeway

Police and emergency workers investigated the Bronx crash, which looks to be the deadliest in New York in the past year

Investigation: The car crashed into a non-public, heavily wooded area of the zoo and was not near any visitors or exhibits

Vaulted: The car hit something on the highway which prompted it to go flying upwards off the overpass

Rescue work: Multiple emergency teams worked together to salvage clues from the scene

Police say Jacob Nunez and Ana Julia 
Martinez were staying with Maria Gonzalez at her home in the Bronx while
visiting from the Dominican Republic.

According to the News, the elders had a total of 13 children, six of whom lived in the U.S.; seven remain in Santo Domingo.

They are believed to have arrived on Thursday for a two-month stay.

Their son, Ignacio Nunez, 64, lost two sisters, his parents and three nieces.

'The injuries were quite horrific. In 30 years I've seen something like this once or twice.'

'I went to the hospital. They’re all dead,' he told the Daily News.

'I don’t know how to feel,' he said. 'I feel very, very bad.'

The family of seven died after their minivan plummeted 59ft from the Bronx River Parkway.

Police say Mrs Gonzalez was at the wheel of a white 2004 Honda Pilot when it vaulted off an overpass.

A police source told MailOnline all 
seven of the victims had to be extracted from the crashed vehicle and 
were pronounced dead at the scene.

According to a police report, the van 
was headed south Sunday afternoon around 12:30pm on the Bronx River 
Parkway, a highway in the north of the city.

Seven people- including three children- are confirmed dead after a van crashed off the Bronx River Parkway overpass near the Bronx Zoo

Area: The minivan crashed into the grounds of Bronx Zoo

The vehicle then bounced off the median, crossed all southbound lanes over to the guardrail and fell 59ft.

The car landed in a heavily-overgrown area of the Zoo grounds, which made the recovery difficult for emergency workers.

No criminality is suspected.

One fire fighter suffered minor injuries sustained on the scene.

'It’s terrible, just carnage. The passengers didn’t stand a chance,' an unidentified fire department source told The New York Post.

Police
say Jacob Nunez and Ana Julia Martinez were staying with Maria Gonzalez
at her home in the Bronx while visiting from the Dominican Republic.

The nearly Bronx Zoo, which is the largest metropolitan zoo in the world, is run by the Wildlife Conservation Society.

A representative for the Conservation Society told NY1
that the crash did not take place 'anywhere near the Bronx Zoo's 
exhibits or visitors'.

Vehicle: The car involved in the crash was a white Honda Pilot, like the one shown here, which can hold up to eight passengers

The crash took place in a non-public area of the south eastern portion of the Zoo.

It's not clear what caused the van to
go out of control, but police are speculating that the car was going 
very fast- with the exact speed still unknown.

The injuries were quite horrific,' EMS Deputy Chief Howard Sickles told DNA Info.

'In
30 years I've seen something like this once or twice. Everybody was 
taken aback by it because everybody has a relative, everybody knows a 
child and everybody has a grandparent. ... It's very upsetting.'

The southbound side of the highway was closed Sunday afternoon while police investigated.

Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. said that he will be ordering a safety examination by the relevant authorities in light of the accident.

This is the worst crash New York has seen in over a year, since 14 people died in a bus crash on Interstate 95 headed back from Mohegan Sun casino to Chinatown.

A similar- though non-fatal- accident occurred at the same spot last June when an SUV bounced off the guard rail and fell off the overpass. In that incident, two people inside the car were injured but there were no deaths.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family at this tragic time,' Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.
