Veteran shooter Michael Gault says he can now ‘chillax’ after matching the record number of medals won at a Commonwealth Games with bronze for England in the 10-metre air pistol.

The 60-year-old grandfather from Norfolk, competing in his sixth Games, secured an 18th podium place after coming out of retirement in a bid to break the record held by another shooter, Phillip Adams.

He has now moved level with the Australian, who has long since retired, and could move out on his own as the most decorated Commonwealth athlete in history with a 19th medal in the 50m event tomorrow.

Tied at the top: Gault's bronze medal in the 10m air pistol event was his 18th across six Games

He said: ‘It didn’t matter what colour
 it was, I’ve got the 18 medals now. That’s exactly what the aim was so 
it’s job done now. It’s a weight off my shoulders and I can chillax as 
they say now. I can focus on my next competition.

‘I
 was really feeling the pressure then and all the way through. I don’t 
know where all those 10s were coming from as I was shooting all over the
 place and it was going in the middle. Somebody was on my side.’

Gault
 was leading after 13 shots but a wayward 14th saw him slip down to 
fourth. However, he gathered himself and climbed back into bronze medal 
position behind Daniel Repacholi of Australia, who took gold and Indian 
silver medallist Prakash Nanjappa.

Gault’s England team-mate Stewart Nangle, 48, finished fifth.

Speaking
 about tomorrow’s event, Gault added: ‘We will see what God has got in 
store. I’m not putting any pressure on myself at all as I’ve done it 
now.

‘I can retire, put my feet up and watch everybody else working.

‘There might be a coaching job for me somewhere [after the Games] and I can stay with the sport.

‘Instead of getting tense with a pistol in my hand I will just watch someone else getting tense.’
