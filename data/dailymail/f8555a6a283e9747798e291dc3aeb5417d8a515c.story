You may not get blood from a stone, but if you happen to have one from Mars, you may get water.

A yearlong study of a coal-colored rock from the Red Planet that was found in the Sahara Desert has revealed that not only is it older than other Martian meteorites, but it also contains 10 times more water than the rest.

The baseball-size meteorite, estimated to be 2 billion years old, is strikingly similar to the volcanic rocks examined on the Martian surface by the NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which found water-bearing minerals.

NWA 7034 is made of cemented fragments of basalt, rock that forms from rapidly cooled lava.

The fragments are primarily feldspar and pyroxene, most likely from volcanic activity.

This unusual meteorite's chemistry matches that of the Martian crust as measured by NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers and Mars Odyssey Orbiter.

‘Here we have a piece of Mars that I can hold in my hands. That's really exciting,’ said Carl Agee, director of the Institute of Meteoritics and curator at the University of New Mexico who led the study published online Thursday in the journal Science.

'This Martian meteorite has everything in its composition that you'd want in order to further our understanding of the Red Planet,' he said.

'This unique meteorite tells us what volcanism was like on Mars 2 billion years ago.

'It also gives us a glimpse of ancient surface and environmental conditions on Mars that no other meteorite has ever offered.'

Most space rocks that fall to Earth as meteorites originate in the asteroid belt, but a number come from the moon and Mars.

Scientists believe an asteroid or some other large object struck Mars, dislodging rocks and sending them hurling into space.

Occasionally, some plummet through Earth's atmosphere.

Short of sending a spacecraft or astronaut to the Red Planet to haul back rocks, Martian meteorites are the next best thing for scientists seeking to better understand how Earth's neighbor transformed from a tropical environment to a frigid desert.

About 110 Martian rocks have been 
recovered on Earth, mostly in Antarctica or the Sahara. The oldest dates
back 4.5 billion years to a time when Mars was warmer and wetter.

About half a dozen Martian meteorites are 1.3 billion years old and the rest are 600 million years or younger.

The
latest meteorite Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 - nicknamed ‘Black 
Beauty’- was donated to the University of New Mexico by an American who 
bought it from a Moroccan meteorite dealer last year.

Ancient find: This Mars rock, which fell in Abu Hommos, Egypt in 1911, is particularly large meteorite from the Red Planet

Unusual discovery: Scientists believe that the meteorite found in Sahara was formed by cooling lava in the Martian crust

Researchers performed a battery of tests on the meteorite and based on its chemical signature confirmed that it was blasted to Earth from Mars.

Almost all Martian meteorites can be put 
in one of three groups known as Shergotty, Nakhla, and Chassigny - named for the locations where the first of each type of meteorite was discovered - which scientists refer to simply as SNC. 

But according to researchers, the Sahara find belongs in a class of its own.

One of a kind: Unlike other Martian meteorites, the 'Black Beauty' does not fit into any pf the existing classifications of rocks from the Red Planet

Missing link: The Sahara find may help scientists understand how Earth's neighbor transformed from a tropical environment to a frigid desert

At 2.1 billion years old, it's the second-oldest known Martian meteorite that formed from a volcanic eruption.

When the researchers compared the geochemical makeup of the meteorite to data from soil and rock samples obtained by Martian rovers, they discovered that it likely came from the planet's crust, not its mantle.

While researchers have found meteorites formed from chunks of basalt cemented together in the moon's crust, they have never seen anything like this on Mars.

There's also evidence that it was altered by water. Though the amount released during heating was small - 6,000 parts per million - it was still about 10 times more than other Martian meteorites.

Scientists said this suggested there was interaction with water near the surface during a time when the planet was mostly dry and dusty.

More tests are under way to determine how long the rock floated in space and how long it had been sitting in the Sahara.

University of Alberta meteorite expert Chris Herd said the find was welcome since most Martian rocks that rain on Earth tend to be younger.

The latest find does not appear to be too contaminated, he said.

‘It's fairly fresh.

'It hasn't been subjected to a whole lot of weathering,’ said Herd, who had no role in the research

The discovery of the 'Black Beauty' meteorite may shed light on Mars' distant past, which was possibly much wetter and warmer than previously believed.

'The contents of this meteorite may challenge many long held notions about Martian geology," said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.

'These findings also present an important reference frame for the Curiosity rover as it searches for reduced organics in the minerals exposed in the bedrock of Gale Crater.'
