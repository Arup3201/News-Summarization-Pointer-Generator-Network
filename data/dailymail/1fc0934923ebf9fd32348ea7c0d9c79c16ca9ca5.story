Gunman: This undated photo provided by the Ridgecrest, Calif. police shows Sergio Munoz, 39, the gunman who fatally shot a woman, injured another and then led police on a wild chase before he was killed in a shootout

A sister of a survivor in the deadly Ridgecrest, California, shooting rampage said the gunman was a heroin dealer who wanted to eliminate snitches.

Dawn Meier revealed Friday that 39-year-old Sergio Munoz was friends with her brother, but shot him and his girlfriend when the brother refused to go along with the murderous plot.

The girlfriend was killed in the early morning shooting. Dawn Meier said her brother, Thaddeus Meier, is recovering at a hospital.

Munoz later took a man and woman hostage and led police on a lengthy car chase with the pair in his trunk.

Authorities
say Munoz was killed when he stopped on the side of the road in the 
Mojave Desert and began firing his gun into the trunk.

Police said the hostages are in critical condition.

According to his Facebook account, 
Munoz worked as operator technician for the company Searles Valley 
Minerals. He listed Mr Meier as a friend on the social media site.

Munoz
called a Ridgecrest police officer's cell phone and said he wanted to 
come to the department and shoot officers but because police had too 
many guns he would 'wreak havoc' elsewhere, Kern County Sheriff Donny 
Youngblood told a press conference.

Scene: The suspect fired at least ten times from inside his black Dodge Dart, and tried to run vehicles off the road before he was shot dead by police

At one point during the chase, which lasted more than 40 minutes, the suspect pulled over and the car's trunk popped open, revealing a man and woman inside

Nearly
two hours later, a sheriff's deputy spotted the suspect's car and a 
pursuit began. The suspect fired at least ten times from inside his 
black Dodge Dart, and tried to run vehicles off the road.

No motorists were hurt, Youngblood said.

At one point during the chase, which 
lasted more than 40 minutes, Munoz pulled over and the car's trunk
popped open, revealing a man and woman inside.

They appeared to shut the trunk, the sheriff said.

At
the end, the man pulled over again on U.S. 395 and began shooting into 
the trunk. As many as seven officers opened fire, killing him.

At
the original crime scene in the city of Ridgecrest, about 150 miles 
north of Los Angeles, a woman was found dead her boyfriend, later identified as Thaddeus Meier, was wounded, 
Youngblood said.

The suspect apparently knew all of the victims, he said.

The city of about 27,000 people is adjacent to the vast Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which sprawls over more than 1,700 square miles of desert

There was some information that the suspect was using Facebook during pursuit, but it wasn't immediately clear what the postings were, Youngblood said.

During his phone call, the man also said he had a package he wanted to deliver to police, the sheriff said. It was unclear if a package was found. Investigators recovered a shotgun and a handgun.

A crime scene was set up along U.S. 395 at Kramer Junction, where two police helicopters landed amid numerous law enforcement vehicles.

The CHP said the highway was closed from Kramer Junction for ten miles north because of the investigation.

Schools in Ridgecrest were placed on lockdown as a precaution but were later reopened.

The city of about 27,000 people is adjacent to the vast Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, which sprawls over more than 1,700 square miles of desert. U.S. 395 runs through the western Mojave below the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada.

Ridgecrest Mayor Dan Clark called the incident disturbing, especially because the small city is relatively crime free.
