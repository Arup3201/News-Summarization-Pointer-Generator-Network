A 91-year-old woman's house has lost half its value because an overgrown Japanese knotweed has started taking over the back garden.

Elizabeth Abraham has been told the house in Swansea, which was expected to be valued at £80,000, will not sell for more than £45,000 because of the untamed wild weed.

Her great niece, Elizabeth Wakeman, has been appointed power of attorney over her affairs and needed to sell the property to pay for Ms Abraham's stay at a care home.

A Japanese knotweed has started taking over the back garden of Elizabeth Abraham's home in Carmarthen Road, Swansea

She said the strip of land where the invasive plant is growing is unregistered, so they do not know who owns the area.

'The strip of land is about big enough for four or five houses, but I've been in touch with the Land Registry, who say the land is unregistered,' said Ms Wakeman.

'So we face losing out on half the property's worth.

'The money isn't for us — we need to pay social services for the care they've received, as well as accommodation.

'So it's extremely frustrating, because we can't find out who the land belongs to.'

The house is now estimated to be worth £45,000, much less than the £80,000 expected

Japanese knotweed can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October

The Land Registry said the strip of land behind the property on Carmarthen Road was not registered.

Compulsory registration of land only came into force in 1975 and any land sold after that date is obliged to be registered with them. 

Japanese knotweed - which has the scientific name fallopia japonica - was introduced into Britain by the Victorians.

Incredibly invasive, it can grow four inches (ten centimetres) in a day from April to October and a tiny root can establish itself as a plant in just ten days.

Apparently solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves clog waterways.

Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn.
