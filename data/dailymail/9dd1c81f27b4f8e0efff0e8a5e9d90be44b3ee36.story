Dash-cam footage emerged today showing the moment that George Zimmerman was pulled over by a police officer in Texas for speeding and told them he was carrying a gun.

Just over two weeks since his dramatic acquittal for the murder of Trayvon Martin, 17, Zimmerman was issued the warning on Sunday in Forney, Texas, just 25 miles from Dallas.

The latest traffic incident comes a week-and-a-half after Zimmerman rescued a family-of-four from their upturned SUV over a thousand miles away in Florida, near  where he shot Martin dead. 

Armed: George Zimmerman was pulled over on the road in Forney, Texas and it was revealed that he had a gun in a glovebox

With Zimmerman facing death threats following his acquittal, his brother Robert said that his family have to deal with rumors about his whereabouts every day.

He added that they go to great lengths to ensure their safety in accordance with the law.

CBS Dallas Fort Worth have claimed that the officer did not recognize Zimmerman, who has been at the center of a nationwide controversy since he was found not guilty of the second-degree murder and manslaughter of Trayvon Martin earlier this month.

Indeed, Zimmerman is even reported to have asked the officer if he knew his face from television and the officer again told the one-time Florida neighborhood watch captain that he did not.

While being questioned by the officer, Zimmerman, who was driving a 2008 Honda pick-up with Florida plates, told the officer that he was armed and was instructed to keep the gun in the car's glove-compartment.

The officer issued Zimmerman a warning for speeding and then sent him on his way - but not before asking him where he was going, to which he replied 'nowhere in particular'.

'Nowhere in particular, why is that?' responded the officer according to In Forney.com

'You didn’t see my name?' said Zimmerman. The officer then responded, 'wow, what a coincidence.'

The officer then inquired if Zimmerman was free of any warrants for arrest, to which Zimmerman replied, 'absolutely'.

'Alright, I’m gonna go back and just check you, routinely,' said the officer as he checked Zimmerman's proof of insurance and a driver’s license.

'The reason you were stopped was for your speed, why don’t you slow down a little bit for me and, as long as you don’t have any warrants, I’ll cut you loose with a warning,' said the officer to Zimmerman according to In Forney.com.

'Just take it easy, go ahead and shut your glove compartment and don’t play with your firearm, ok?'

The traffic stop according to 
InForney.Com lasted approximately five minutes and after being given a 
warning, Zimmerman was sent on his way - being wished 'a safe trip' by 
the officer.

In the aftermath of his acquittal Zimmerman's lawyers said that he would almost certainly rearm himself and would be handed back the 9mm Kel-Tec pistol he used to kill Martin.

Federal investigators have not yet returned the weapon.

And
 even though the fact that Zimmerman is back carrying a weapon will 
certainly be viewed as controversial, Zimmerman is legally permitted to 
under Texas state law.

The gun in the glove box is legal in Texas, and police routinely ask motorists if they have weapons in the car, Brooks said. He said the entire stop lasted less than five minutes.

'It wasn't for super-excessive speeds, they just got him on regular speeding,' said Brian Brooks, city manager of Forney, Texas, about 25 miles southeast of Dallas, where Zimmerman was stopped.

'It's a pretty routine stop except for the fact that it was George Zimmerman.'

Zimmerman, 29, who is white and Hispanic, was found not guilty of murder and manslaughter on July 13 in Florida after a racially charged trial in the shooting of Martin in February 2012. Thousands of people demonstrated across the United States after the verdict.

Zimmerman, who was a volunteer neighborhood watchman in the central Florida town of Sanford, Florida at the time of the shooting, said he acted in self-defense.

Scene: The crash occurred at the intersection of I-4 and route Route 46, pictured, less than a mile from where Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin

This is the second highway-related incident involving Zimmerman that has come to the media's attention since his highly controversial acquittal.

Last week it emerged that Zimmerman pulled a couple from their upturned SUV after a crash on a stretch of Florida highway just yards from where he shot and illed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.

The crash on the 17th July left occurred when Dana and Mark Gerstle lost control of their vehicle on a ramp that left them and their two children, aged eight and four trapped.

Zimmerman did not witness the accident which took place at 5.47pm  but was on the scene shortly afterwards.

Though he spoke with his lawyers last Friday he did not make any mention of the rescue.Speaking to MailOnline Shawn Vincent, a spokesman for Zimmerman’s attorney Mark O’Mara said: ‘We spoke with George on Friday and he made no mention of this at all. That’s very typical of George.

‘He has a history of getting involved….it’s just the way he is.

‘There has already been the backlash of people saying this is some sort of PR stunt but it isn’t. We’ve had it confirmed by the Sheriff.’

The heroic rescue took place just four days later, less than a mile from where Zimmerman shot the teen in a gated Sanford community in Seminole County.

Sanford Police Department Capt Jim McAuliffe said that Zimmerman was identified by one of the crash victims as the man who pulled him and his family from the mangled blue Ford Explorer.

Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman, Jr., said in a Wednesday statement: 'Our family receives innumerable death threats on a daily basis. We all continue to take our security and privacy very seriously and go to great lengths to ensure our safety in accordance with the law. '

He went on to accuse the media of speculating and publishing misinformation about the whereabouts of family members that was putting George in particular at risk and called this 'irresponsible and counterproductive.'
