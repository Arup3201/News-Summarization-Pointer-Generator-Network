The head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle David Boynton (pictured) has been banned from the road for drink driving

The head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle has been banned from the road for drink driving - after he had an afternoon 'tipple' with the Duchess of Rutland.

David Boynton, 76, got behind the wheel of his Mitsubishi after he was invited to join the Duchess, Emma Rutland, for a sherry to celebrate his recent marriage.

The court heard Boynton felt obliged to accept but tried to get rid of most of it without the Duchess noticing by pouring it into a nearby plant pot.

Boynton was then stopped by police after he was seen driving erratically near his home on the 16,000-acre estate.

Officers found the tipple had pushed him just over the limit- with  82 milligrammes of alcohol in 100ml of blood - the legal limit is 80 milligrammes.

On Monday Boynton, who has been head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle for three years, admitted to drink driving when he appeared at Grantham Magistrate's Court.

He was handed a 12-month driving ban which would be reduced to nine if he completes a drink driver's rehabilitation course.

He was fined £230, ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £23 victim surcharge. 

Prosecutor Marie Stace said: 'Police stopped the Mitsubishi Mr Boynton was driving on Eastwell Road in Belvoir.

'The officers could smell alcohol and after Boynton failed a roadside breath test he was arrested and taken to the police station, where a blood test was taken.'

The Duchess, Emma Rutland, 53, provided a character reference for the defendant in a letter read by magistrates.

They also heard that Boynton lives on the estate in Knipton, Leicestershire.

Sonia Bhalla, defending, said Boyton had joined the Duchess of Rutland for a sherry at around 4pm on December 8 last year.

Ms Bhalla, defending, said: 'Mr Boynton had been Belvoir Castle's head gamekeeper for the last three years, and on the date in question he had been to see his employer the Duchess of Rutland and she had offered him a tipple.

'He felt obliged to accept, although recognised that he wasn't under duress. He did try to tip the alcohol into a nearby plant pot. He then left the castle and drove into the open arms of the law.

'Mr Boynton is an absolutely lovely individual, and it was his first ever brush with the law. I can tell you that this is an absolutely lovely individual.

'He has worked from the age of seven, and is still in full-time employment. He has been head gamekeeper at Belvoir Castle for the last three seasons..'

Magistrates said that it was one of the lowest blood readings they had ever seen.

Earlier this month a neighbour living next to the Duke of Rutland's daughters in London complained about the siblings raucous late-night parties.

Jackie Elliott wrote to the Duke, David Manners, who is worth around £125 million, claiming that it was like 'living next door to a nightclub..'

The Duke's daughters, Lady Violet Manners, 21, and sisters Lady Alice, 19, and Lady Eliza, 17, live in a £2.6million mansion on Bovington Road, Fulham. 

David Boynton today refused to comment on his driving ban. Speaking from his farm house on the sprawling Belvoir Castle estate, he said: 'No comment. You can get off this land.'

A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess of Rutland said: 'The comment will be no comment.'

The Duke and Duchess of Rutland at  home

Twenty years ago, the duchess was plain Emma Watkins, a farmer’s daughter from Radnorshire in the Welsh borders. 

But in 1992, Emma married David- the Duke of Rutland, whose ancestral home, Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire had been in the family since 1509. 

The Duke and Duchess of Rutland, went onto have five children – Violet, Alice, Eliza, Charles and Hugo.

More than a decade ago, when Emma’s father-in-law Charles died, her husband David found himself 11th Duke of Rutland and the 36th generation of his family to inherit the castle and its estate.

At the time, the castle was in crisis facing dwindling visitor numbers, death duties of almost £10 million and repair costs of up to an eye-watering £6.5 million.

Thanks to the Duke and Duchess, today, Belvoir is the setting for national events such as the CLA Game Fair, rock concerts, weddings,product launches, TV shows and feature films. 

Eagle-eyed cinema-goersmay have spotted the castle in various guises in Hollywood movies suchas The Da Vinci Code and The Young Victoria. 

But while the estate was doing well, the Rutlands' marriage  was crumbling.

In 2012, the Duchess finally announced she was separating from the Duke of Rutland after a number of infidelities by her husband.

Despite the end of their marriage, the couple have remained living in the colossal gothic castle, living separate lives in different wings.
