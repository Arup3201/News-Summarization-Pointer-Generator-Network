Schumacher is 'showing small signs of progress' his spokeswoman said on Sunday

Michael Schumacher is 'showing small signs of progress' as he continues to slowly recover from devastating brain injuries suffered in a ski accident, his spokeswoman said on Sunday.

Speaking on live television, the driver's manager Sabine Kehm spoke of the F1 legend's recovery and how his 'little bit of progress makes us very happy.'

Miss Kehm told German broadcaster ARD: 'There are short moments of consciousness and he is showing small signs of progress.

'There are moments when he is awake and moments when he is conscious.

'Of course I am not a doctor, but medically, there is a distinction between being awake and being conscious, the latter meaning there is an ability to interact with his surroundings.

'I don't want to disclose details out of respect for the family, but we have no doubt at all in the abilities of the doctors treating Michael, they are experts in their field.'

Doctors put Schumacher
 into a medically induced coma after he hit his head on a rock while 
skiing at the French resort of Meribel on December 29.

Miss Kehm
 insisted Schumacher will be brought out of the coma - but did not indicate how long the process would take.

She added that
 if and when Schumacher is moved to a rehabilitation clinic - to begin 
the long recovery process of learning to speak and move again - his 
state of health will become a 'private matter' and no more news will be 
forthcoming.

She said: 'Michael Schumacher is in a coma and can not
 decide what is reported about him. We of course know how he deals with
 such things and try in his interest to handle these matters for him.'

Her words this evening come just hours after International Automobile Federation president Jean Todt said the driver was still 'fighting' for his life and his future remains uncertain. 

'I
 see him very often and he's still fighting. He's fighting and we can 
only hope and pray that it will improve over the future,' Todt told 
journalists on the sidelines of World Touring Car Championship race in 
Marrakech.

'It has been a tragedy this accident. A tragedy for Michael, a tragedy for his family.

'Michael is in very good hands with fantastic dedicated doctors in the hospital in Grenoble.

'Obviously, I'm very close to him, to the family,' Todt added.

Sabine Kehm, pictured in January this year speaking with journalists, gave the update live on German television this evening. She said: 'There are short moments of consciousness and he is showing small signs of progress'

Tonight, Miss Kehm told interviewer Guenther Jauch of the extreme lengths some fans have gone in order to get 
close to the driver in hospital.

She
 said one man was stopped by security before he got on to Schumacher's 
intensive care ward at the University of Grenoble Hospital posing as his
 father Rolf.

In 
another instance two people who wanted to take a photo of the 
45-year-old racing driver on mobile phones were halted by bodyguards in 
the hospital lobby.

Schumacher suffered severe brain injuries
 in a low-speed ski run on the slopes of the French resort and had to be airlifted to hospital where he underwent two 
emergency operations. 

Since then he has reportedly lost almost half his
 body weight and has fought back from a potentially life-threatening 
bout of pneumonia.
