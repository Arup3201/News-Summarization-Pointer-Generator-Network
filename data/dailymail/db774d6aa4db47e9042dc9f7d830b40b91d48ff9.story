Lloyds shareholders called for former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby to give up his £240,000 pension

Furious Lloyds shareholders last night led calls for disgraced former HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby to give up his gold-plated pension worth more than £240,000 a year.

Campaigners said the pension should be paid to ordinary investors who have seen their nest eggs devastated after Lloyds’ disastrous takeover rescue of HBOS in 2008.

The spotlight has switched to Mr Hornby and former chairman Lord Stevenson, after Sir James Crosby asked on Tuesday to be stripped of his knighthood and issued a public apology for the debacle.

Sir James, who was chief executive of HBOS before Mr Hornby, was accused of being the ‘architect’ of the lender’s implosion in a devastating report published by the banking commission last week.

The 57-year-old also offered to give up 30 per cent of his £580,000 a year final salary pension, or around £175,000, which he hopes to give to charity or to Lloyds shareholders.

Last night pressure was mounting on Mr Hornby to give up some of the huge pension he amassed in less than eight years at Halifax and HBOS, formed when Halifax and Bank of Scotland merged in 2001. Sir James, Mr Hornby and former chairman Lord Stevenson were all accused of ‘catastrophic failures of management’ which led to the collapse of HBOS. Lloyds had to be bailed out with £20.5billion of taxpayers’ money in October 2008, weeks after its disastrous rescue.

Adrian Lithgow, from Lloyds Action Now – a campaign group battling to secure compensation for 7,500 Lloyds shareholders – said: ‘Crosby clearly feels the shame of destroying one of Britain’s finest institutions. It is up to others, like Hornby, to now follow his example. He should give up his pension and divert this money to shareholders who have suffered hugely as a result of his actions.’

While Sir James has been forced to quit lucrative board positions since last week’s report, Mr Hornby is clinging on to his role as chief executive of bookmaker Coral, where is thought to receive more than £500,000 a year. 

He also has a huge retirement nest egg, courtesy of HBOS, where directors enjoyed a final salary pension more generous than that given to MPs, and similar to that of the governor of the Bank of England.

This allowed Mr Hornby to accumulate an annual pension worth £240,000 in less than eight years after joining Halifax in 1999.

By
the time the 46-year-old Yorkshireman is entitled to his full pension, 
at 55, it could be worth around £390,000 a year. An ordinary saver would
have to amass a pot of £13.5million to achieve this, according to 
experts.

Paul Moore, former
head of risk at HBOS, who was sacked shortly after raising concerns 
about reckless lending at the bank, said: ‘Hornby must follow the 
example set by Crosby and give up this pension – although 30 per cent is
not enough.’

Coral last night reiterated its backing for Mr Hornby.
