A woman who lost her wedding ring in Chicago got the surprise of her life when it was miraculously found by a man 650 miles away in Arkansas.

In all fairness, Steve Anderson was shocked, too, when he opened a UPS package while at work and found a diamond ring.

‘Every day we pick up our UPS packages and bring them in,’ said Anderson, a warehouse manager in North Little Rock. ‘But after opening it up, I got a surprise because on top of the wrapping was a ring!’

Panicked: Barb Kasang was distraught after losing her wedding ring while working at the same job she'd shared with her husband for 28 years

While Anderson’s reaction was one of mild amusement, up in Chicago Barb Kasang was frantically searching for her diamond ring.

‘My whole marriage is tied up in my ring,’ Kasang told KATV. ‘It has a lot of special moments.’

Kasang and husband Stave have been married for 28 years. They met at Lovejoy, a manufacturer of transmission parts in Downers Grove, Illinois.

In fact, they both still work there. And
that’s where Kasang, 51, noticed she’d lost her wedding ring while 
washing her hands after working the shipping department. The same ring 
her loving husband had been adding gems and bands to over the years.

Long lost: Barb's husband had been adding stones and bands since they married. Barb was worried she accidentally shipped the ring while sending out boxes for work

Lost and found: That was last Monday in Chicago. On Wednesday, in Arkansas, Steve Anderson found a wedding ring in a box that had been shipped to his job

‘I was worried, hurt and sad,’ she told the Chicago Tribune. ‘It was traumatic. I didn't even want to tell my husband.’

But she did tell him.

‘He was pretty calm,’ Kasang said. ‘He said, “Don't worry about it, we'll replace it.” But it's not the same. To me, it's not just a ring. It's like half of my life is in there.’

That was back on June 3. Two agonizing days passed.

Good deed: 'I like to do what is right' said Anderson. He returned the ring and within a week of losing it, the ring was back on Barb's finger

Thankful: Barb, here with her husband, was thrilled. 'My heart's still pounding,' she said. 'You can't say enough about people like that.'

Meanwhile, Anderson made his find and knew someone was out there worried.

‘I thought if it was real, someone would be really upset about it,’ he said.

Anderson said he’d lost important things of his own in the past and been blessed to have them returned. ‘I think turnabout is fair play,’ he said. ‘The thing about it is, I like to do what is right.’

Then, on Wednesday, Kasang got a phone call. Anderson was on the line, he'd found her ring and tracked her down.

By Friday, she was happily wearing her ring again.

‘My heart's still pounding,’ Kasang said. ‘We got lucky. He deserves a big blessing. There's some good people out there. You can't say enough about people like that. I think this man should really be praised.’

According to Anderson, though, there are just more honest people out there than we think.
