A youth who beat a homeless man to death when he was just 16 and avoided jail for burglary just a few weeks ago has been given yet another let-off.

Craig Real, 21, was sentenced to nearly five years for the manslaughter of Big Issue seller Ralph Millward, in Bournemouth, Dorset.

But two months after leaving prison this year, he broke into a garden summer house in nearby Poole and stole a TV worth £250.

Rather than being sent back to prison for the raid, he was handed a community order and told to attend a 'Thinking Skills Programme'.

Real has now broken the terms of the order by missing an appointment with probation officers.

But a judge has allowed him to remain free because it was a single breach of the order.

Judge Peter Johnson gave Real a month-long curfew from 8pm to 6am and ordered him to wear an electronic tag.

It is the third chance Real has been given since he and two friends beat Mr Millward to death in 2009 when Real was just 16.

The trio punched and kicked the helpless victim as he slept outside a Waitrose store in Westbourne, Bournemouth, Dorset, because he refused to give them his cigarettes.

Craig Real, pictured, has broken the terms of a court order imposed on him by missing an appointment with probation officers.

Real was jailed for manslaughter in 2010 but was freed after serving just half that time. But he failed to keep to a set of conditions of his licence and was rearrested and sent back to jail.

In April this year, two months after his release, he stole a £250 television from the summer house of a property in Poole, for which he was given the community order which he then breached weeks later.

Judge Peter Johnson was told that Real had difficulty finding accommodation but will now live with his grandmother in Wallisdown.

At Bournemouth Crown Court, the judge said he did not revoke the order and send Real into custody because it was a single breach.

Local residents took to an online messaging board to express their outrage at the latest sentencing.

One wrote: 'Disgusting. This toe rag gets yet another chance. Where's the chance he gave his defenceless victim?

'The legal system needs an overhaul immediately.'

Another said: 'There appears to be no justice whatsoever and he's given yet another chance to break his court order again.'

Last month Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, reacted with 'astonishment' at Real's sentencing for the burglary.

He said: 'This was clearly not his first crime. You don't somehow move into a different category of crime and have your past misdeeds wiped clean.'

Conor Burns, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West, said: 'The fact that he has emerged from prison and is clearly addicted to a life of crime shows the criminal justice system is not working.'
