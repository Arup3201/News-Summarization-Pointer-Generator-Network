St Leger winner Kingston Hill has joined the list of notable absentees from Champions Day at Ascot on Saturday after trainer Roger Varian announced the grey would not run again this season.

Kingston Hill, fourth to Treve in the Arc, had been a possible for the Champion Stakes.

But Varian said: 'Kingston Hill will not run again this season. He is a horse with a great constitution but we feel that this race comes just too soon after such a big effort in France.

'He has done us proud this season, winning the St Leger, finishing second in the Derby and fourth in the Arc. He remains in training and we are looking forward to campaigning him in the big middle distance races next year.'

Kingston Hill joins John Gosden's top-miler Kingman and Aidan O'Brien's dual Derby-winner Australia in missing the end-of-season finale.

On Saturday, the last-named was retired after a hoof problem which surfaced last week meant he could not be prepared for what was intended to be his final race.

Coral make French-trained Cirrus Des Aigles, the 2011 winner, 7-4 favourite for the Champion Stakes ahead of Dermot Weld's Free Eagle (2-1).
