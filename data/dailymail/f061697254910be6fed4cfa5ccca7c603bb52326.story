A seven-year-old girl from New York City, who was stabbed repeatedly in an elevator of her apartment building, is slowly recovering at home.

Mikayla Capers was stabbed 16 times and her best friend, six-year-old PJ Avitto was killed, during an attack in the Brooklyn building where they both lived last month.

A 27-year-old, who had recently been released from prison, has been charged with the attack.

Daniel St. Hubert, was charged with the murder of PJ and the attack on Mikayla, on June 5, the day before hundreds of people gathered for the funeral of the little boy.

The young friends had been heading out of their building to buy ice creams on June 1 when they were attacked.

PJ's body was found inside the elevator, and Mikayla was found barely conscious outside a nearby building.

She is slowly recovering from the physical injuries she suffered in the attack, and her family said she is being helped with the emotional trauma by a teddy bear that sings 'smile though your heart is aching'.

St Hubert, who is accused of carrying out the attack, had only just been released from prison, where he had served a five-year sentence for attempted murder and assault.

Suspect: Daniel St Hubert, who had recently been released from prison on an attempted murder charge, was arrested in connection with the attack

Court records show he was arrested in May 2009 after punching his mother in the face, choking her with an electrical cord and stealing her car. He pleaded guilty in July 2012.

Police said St Hubert was a suspect in the stabbing of a homeless man on a Manhattan subway platform and the fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Tanaya Copeland, just a few blocks from the Brooklyn elevator attack. He is not charged in those crimes.

Investigators are now reviewing all stabbings citywide that have occurred since St Hubert was freed on May 23.

If convicted, St Hubert faces a maximum 50 years to life in prison.
