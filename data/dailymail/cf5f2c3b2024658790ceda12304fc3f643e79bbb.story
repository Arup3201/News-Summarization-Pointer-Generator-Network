An image released by NASA shows how arctic winds dipped south this winter, causing sensually cold conditions across the Midwest, East Coast and South.

Known as the polar vortex, the winds above the arctic 'typically blow in a fairly tight circular formation,' the agency said on Facebook.

Known as the polar vortex, the winds above the arctic usually spin tight above the North Pole.

But this year the winds loosened in late December and into early January, causing cold air to spill south into the continental U.S.

This uncommon weather phenomenon caused record lows across the country from Colorado to New York and as far south as Alabama, according to the National Weather Service.

'In some places temperatures were 40 degrees Fahrenheit colder than average,' NASA said.

This dramatic change in weather caused problems across the nation.

The weather in the Midwest caused thousands of flight cancellations and delays while schools in Chicago were cancelled because of the 'life-threatening' temperatures.

In Atlanta, Georgia - which can go an entire winter without seeing snow - two inches of snow practically shut down the city and caused massive traffic delays because of unsafe road conditions.
