A spokeswoman for Liberty London was unable to provide figures at this stage of the day but said it had been a 'crazy week' for the store, adding: 'We're open 'til 10 tonight so still a long way to go.'

She also anticipated a busy few days this coming week ahead of Christmas Day.

David Barford, retail operations director at John Lewis, said that while they were experiencing a busy day today, they predict that momentum will continue into next week 'now that schools have broken up and people have time off work', adding: 'People know they have more time to do their shopping.'

Mr Barford said deliveries were also running smoothly and pointed out the types of products that are selling fast.

'As you'd expect at this time of year, beauty is performing particularly well, along accessories like handbags and purses. Childrenswear is also having a strong week,' he said.

Birmingham's Bullring complex said it expected to welcome around 200,000 shoppers during today and a further 110,000 tomorrow.

Nearly 61 million shoppers are expected to head to high streets between today and Christmas Eve - up 14 per cent on last year

Michaela Moore, the mall's general manager, said: 'It's been a busy December at Bullring, we've welcomed a number of new stores including Ted Baker, Victoria's Secret and Kipling, and we've seen huge visitor numbers.

'With many schools now on their Christmas holidays we're anticipating a busy few days.'

CRR's report, for Vouchercodes.co.uk, found that delayed online orders, poor weather in some areas and earlier sales were expected to drive 60.9 million shoppers to the high street between today and Christmas Eve - up 14 per cent on last year.   

Britain's department stores are expecting to double their takings this weekend alone, with outlets in the north of England set to benefit the most from Panic Saturday, according to data from payment processing company Worldpay. 

It said the number of card payments processed by department stores in some parts of the UK just prior to Christmas rose by as much as 224 per cent this time last year, with even better figures expected this year.

Worldpay UK managing director Dave Hobday said: 'Department stores are magnets for shoppers who find themselves in the last-chance saloon in the final few days before Christmas. 

'Many of these eleventh-hour shoppers will be breaking into a cold sweat at the thought of heading to the high street on the busiest shopping day of the year and praying for someone to take the pain away.'  

But those averse to crowds are advised to stay home on Tuesday next week for what is expected to be the busiest single high street shopping day ahead of Christmas.

One shopping centre has predicted that about seven out of 10 shoppers on Christmas Eve will be panic-buying men 

Overall, the seven day period before Christmas Day is predicted to see a 7 per cent increase in spending and an 8 per cent increase in transactions on the same period last year. 

Visa Europe managing director for the UK and Ireland, Kevin Jenkins, said: 'Black Friday kick-started Christmas on the high street and online this year but the busiest bricks and mortar day will likely remain in its traditional slot close to Christmas.  

'Retailers' multi-channel approach should cause a surge in footfall from click-and-collect sales too, with the opportunity for further shopping in-store when consumers arrive. 

'Across Tuesday December 23 we are likely to see £1.3billion spent in total. Lunch hour should prove the most popular time for a shopping trip, either for last minute gifts or final ingredients for Christmas dinner.' 

Westfield director Myf Ryan said: 'We are expecting this Saturday to be the busiest day for shopping so far this year. Last year our London centres attracted over 320,000 shoppers on the last Saturday before Christmas and we are again expecting big numbers this year.

'Over three million shoppers each year leave their Christmas shopping to the last 12 days. Promotions continue to be a key factor this year following the huge success of Black Friday where we had over 20 per cent growth year-on-year, but luxury brands are also drawing shoppers who are looking for that extra-special gift.' .

Bluewater said gift cards are finding favour, with consumers snapping up £2m worth of gift cards this festive season - up 13 per cent on last year.

The centre's retailers have seen men's gadgets and women's clothing and handbags topping Christmas wish lists.

Top sellers for women include cashmere accessories, Michael Kors handbags and Chanel perfume, while top sellers for men include a host of gadgets with Nespresso coffee machines, Sonos wireless speakers, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One games consoles proving hot favourites.

The shopping centre said seven out of 10 shoppers on Christmas Eve will be panic-buying men.
