Aid agency Medecins Sans Frontiere has been carrying out hundreds of life-saving operations at a secret hospital in war-torn Syria.

An international team of doctors converted a villa in the Middle East country into a field hospital to treat people caught up in the bloody conflict.

Those working at the state-of-the-art medical centre say they have decided to speak out and appeal for help because the health situation in Syria has become 'desperate'.

Some of those receiving treatment included victims who have traveled for up to two days for help, said members of the small group of physicians yesterday.

It took doctors a week to transform the home in a rebel-held area in northern Syria into a field hospital, equipped with an emergency room, an operating theatre, a sterilisation room and a resuscitation area.

The centre, which has been mainly treating war casualties from the country's second city of Aleppo, opened in late June after months of planning and secret attempts to smuggle in equipment.

'We could see and hear the shelling almost on a daily basis,' said Brian Moller, an Australian anesthetic nurse on the team of seven foreigners and about 50 Syrians.

'Enough is enough. Both [the Syrian regime and the opposition] are increasingly relying on violence to achieve their aims.

'The health situation in Syria is desperate. We need to open up humanitarian access routes, especially to Aleppo. It is time to speak up and say we need a political solution.'

Moller said they made sure the Syrian government knew about them without letting authorities know where the field hospital would operate.

'They did not appreciate or like our presence,' he added.

Katherine Holte, a Danish surgeon who spent four weeks at the field hospital, said conditions were growing increasingly dire in Syria, and nearly all her patients were victims of the fighting - about 60 percent suffering from explosions and 40 percent from gunshot wounds.

'They live in fear every day,' she said.

Adding that many patients used back roads to skirt checkpoints and other military operations, taking as long as two days to travel 15 miles.

Although small field hospitals are appearing around Syria, Ms Holte said few have the resources of the one established by the aid group, also known as Doctors without Borders.

The hospital's exact location is being kept secret for fear it may be targeted by regime forces and from the outside it looks just like a civilian home, said MSF.

Holte said other, cruder hospitals around the county learned about the villa and soon started sending their own patients.

The French military sent its own team of doctors to the Syria-Jordan border earlier this month to set up a mobile hospital.

France, Syria's onetime colonial ruler, has been in the forefront of diplomatic efforts to end the civil war in Syria.

On Tuesday, French President Francois Hollande was meeting in Paris with members of the opposition Syrian National Council, including its leader, Abdelbaset Sieda, a Swedish-based activist for Syria's minority Kurdish community.

A total of 150 operations have so far been declared in the centre which has been declared illegal by the Syrian regime and wounds inflicted on victims are said to have become much worse since the JulyÂ  rebel bomb attack which killed President Bashar-al-Assad's inner circle.

MSF also said it was seeing more injuries caused by tank-shelling, aerial bombardment and heavy artillery than at another other time during the 17-month conflict.

U.S. officials have said conflict had turned the area into one of the world's biggest humanitarian crises, with 2.5million people inside Syria now in neeed of aid and injured victims having to spend days crossing into neighbouring countries for help.
