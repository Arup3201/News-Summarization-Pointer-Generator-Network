Concerned: Missing student Jason Fyles has not been seen since last Thursday after he claimed people had turned their backs on him

Police have stepped up their search for a student who went missing after posting a disturbing Twitter message claiming people had turned their backs on him.

Jason Fyles, a 19-year-old Newcastle University student, vanished after a night out with friends five days ago.

'I find it really sad that everyone that I tried to get help. From just. Turned. Their. Back,' he tweeted after leaving a friend's house during the early hours of 
Thursday morning.

He has not been seen or heard from since.

Jason's family, parents Ian and Caroline, brother Shaun and sister Kimberley, have now travelled to Newcastle from their hometown of Southport on Merseyside, to help search for him.

'Jason, please get in touch,' they said in a statement today.

'We love you very much and all we want is to hear your voice and know that you're safe.

'Please call us or call the police so that we know that you are alright.

'Whatever it is that is troubling you, whatever has happened to upset you - please give us a chance to help you sort it out.

'We would also ask Jason's friends, or anyone who has seen him or has any information that could possibly help to find him, to get in touch with police.'

Earlier his aunt, Wendy, 48, had also made an emotional plea for help to find her nephew.

She said: 'We just want him back so we can give him a hug. We just need to know where he is. There's such a big piece missing from the family.'

Final message: Jason sent this poignant tweet and has not been seen or heard from since

Jason moved to Tyneside only nine months ago to study town planning, and had been staying in Newcastle University's halls of residence at Bowsden Court in South Gosforth.

His family said he had settled well into student life and was in regular contact with his mother and father.

His aunt said he was in good spirits when he confirmed he would join the family on their annual trip to the Yorkshire Show, and asked his mum to buy him aÂ  ticket.

'He said he wanted a ticket and was in good spirits,' said Wendy. 'He was in good spirits and there was absolutely nothing unusual in that phone call.'

That night, Jason joined fellow students on a night out and drank with friends at Sam Jacks and Tup Tup Palace in Newcastle city centre before becoming separated from the group.

He later paid a late-night visit to his friend Sean Peacock's home in Sandyford.

Sean, who is on the same course as Jason, said he phoned him a number of times before knocking on the door.

When he realised Jason was drunk, Sean offered him a bed for the night, but his friend refused and left.

Then, at just after 3am, Jason sent his final tweet.

Jason's friends reported him missing to police, who then contacted his family.

'His dad received a phone call on Friday evening from Northumbria Police to say his friends had reported him missing,' his aunt Wendy said.

'Immediately after that all the family tried his mobile constantly but it wasn't switched on and nobody has seen or heard from him since.

'He hasn't put anything on Facebook or Twitter either, which is unusual as, like most teenagers, he is a regular user of these.'

Plea: Jason's family have come to the North East and have urged anyone with information about him to contact the police

Jason's loved ones can think of no reason why he could go missing, and now fear the worst.

'Jason is a quiet, reserved lad but he has a very happy disposition,' said Wendy. 'He's just a really nice kid. He's very academic, he had big plans for the future.

'Our family is very, very close. He's at university but he still speaks to his parents every week, which isn't the case with a lot of students. He was very much enjoying uni. He loved the work, had made friends, and was enjoying life in Newcastle, like most students do.

'It's the most out-of-character thing you could imagine from him. He is the youngest of three children and very, very close to his mum.'

Jason's parents have spent the last few days walking the streets of Newcastle and giving out posters with Jason's picture on.

Wendy added: 'They have spent hours and hours traipsing the streets.'

Message: Northumbria Police fear for Jason's safety and say his disappearance is out of character

Supt Andy McDyer, of Northumbria Police's Newcastle Area Command, said: 'His disappearance is out of character and we're concerned for his welfare due to the length of time he's been missing.

'I'd urge anyone who sees him or who has information about his whereabouts to contact police.'

More than 6,000 people have now joined a Facebook group called 'Missing Newcastle Student: Jason Fyles', and scores of messages have been posted.

Anyone with any information on his whereabouts are asked to contact Northumbria Police.
