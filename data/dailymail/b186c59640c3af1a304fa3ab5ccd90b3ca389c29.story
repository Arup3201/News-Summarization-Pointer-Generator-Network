A murder investigation team has taken over the hunt for a missing 14-year-old girl who was last seen walking in the direction of home along a canal tow path.

Detectives from Scotland Yard's homicide and major crime squad are now leading the search for Alice Gross, who went missing last week.

The teenager, who has health problems, left her home in Hanwell, west London at 1pm on Thursday, telling her parents she would be back that evening, and was seen on CCTV on the Grand Union Canal tow path just over an hour later.

She was filmed alone, walking near the Holiday Inn at Brentford Lock, heading towards the Thames at 2.23pm. 

And investigators now say she was seen at the same point on the tow path at 3.45pm going back towards Hanwell.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers said it was 'a matter of course' that the investigation had been taken over by the Homicide and Major Crime Command (HMCC).

He said: 'It is not unusual in circumstances such as this for the HMCC to provide additional expertise and a fresh perspective to support and progress the investigation.

'I would like to stress that there is no change to the status of this investigation. This is and continues to be treated as a missing person's inquiry and our involvement is due to the fact that we have a vulnerable missing young girl who needs to be located as a matter of priority.

'I would like to thank the local community and those who have kept the appeal in the public domain by using social media to highlight Alice's disappearance. This has generated a number of leads and I would urge anyone who has any information that has yet to get in contact with us to please do.

'In particular I would like to speak with anyone who may have seen Alice on the Grand Union Canal or River Brent tow paths during the afternoon of Thursday August 28.'

Scotland Yard said there was nothing to suggest the teenager had come to harm but that the possibility had to be considered as one line of inquiry.

The force said in a statement: 'There is no information at this stage to suggest that anything untoward may have happened to Alice but detectives retain an open mind and consideration has been given to the fact that she may have become a victim of crime.

'This is only one line of inquiry but detectives stress that with the HMCC now providing additional resources and expertise to locate Alice they hope to return her home safe and well.'

On Monday, Alice's family appealed for information about where she is.

Alice's mother Rosalind Hodgkiss, 50, said: 'What I would want to say is whatever she feels, or might have happened, we are not angry with her. We love her, we desperately miss her, we want to support her whatever is going on in her thoughts.

Police and family members launched a major appeal for information following the disappearance of Alice Gross, pictured

'We don't want to speculate about what might have caused her to go, if that indeed is what has happened. We want her to know how much we love her and miss her. There is a huge hole in everybody's life and we can't believe that she is not here.'

The Brentside High School pupil had taken part in a song-writing workshop at the Camden Roundhouse earlier in August and police are trying to trace anyone who befriended her during the course.

Alice is white, 5ft 2in and slim, with shoulder length, light brown hair. When she was last seen she was wearing dark blue jeans, a dark green lacy cardigan and denim blue Vans shoes. She may have had tartan-framed glasses with her.

Her sister Nina, 19, has set up a Facebook page, Find Alice Gross, to help with the search, and celebrities including Jonathan Ross and Graham Norton have helped publicise the hunt via Twitter.
