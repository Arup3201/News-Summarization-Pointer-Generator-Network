George Osborne energised the housing market yesterday by dramatically overhauling the hated stamp duty system

George Osborne energised the housing market yesterday by dramatically overhauling the hated stamp duty system.

Delighting his party and wrongfooting Labour, he made buying a home thousands of pounds cheaper for 98 per cent of families.

Analysts predicted the Chancellor’s move – which takes effect today – will push property prices up almost a third by 2020.

His announcement in the Autumn Statement put the aspirations of homeowners at the centre of next year’s general election campaign.

And it echoed his conference speech in 2007 when he bamboozled Gordon Brown’s Labour government by saying he would raise the inheritance tax threshold to £1million.

The Chancellor also offered relief for professionals paying the 40p higher rate of income tax, went after banks and tax-dodging multinationals and promised £2billion a year more for the NHS.

He laid out plans for further spending cuts that economists say will shrink the state to its smallest size in 80 years.

By 2019/20, public spending will be 35.2 per cent of national income, down from 40.5 per cent now.

Mr Osborne hailed the fastest economic growth in the advanced world – telling MPs that 1,000 jobs are created every day.

The UK is expanding two-and-a-half times faster than Germany and seven times the rate of socialist-ruled France.

But he was forced to admit that the budget deficit is coming down too slowly and tax receipts are lower than expected, meaning more years of austerity lie ahead.

The Office for Budget Responsibility says the stamp duty reforms will lift property values and transactions except at the top end of the market, where the tax will be higher.

The independent agency has raised its forecasts for house prices – predicting they will soar 31.4 per cent between now and the start of 2020.

With the general election only five months away, Mr Osborne’s mini-budget was packed with crowd-pleasing measures and traps for Labour, including:

It was the dramatic and unexpected reform of stamp duty, however, which electrified Westminster. As well as appealing to crucial swing voters in Middle England, it was designed to scupper Labour’s plans to levy a mansion tax on properties worth more than £2million.

The Chancellor said stamp duty had become a ‘badly-designed tax on aspiration’ – and he prompted turmoil in the housing market by announcing that his changes would take effect at midnight.

It means stamp duty will no longer jump dramatically at certain thresholds but will rise gradually through five bands.

Analysts predicted the Chancellor’s move – which takes effect today – will push property prices up almost a third by 2020

Mr Osborne said: ‘It’s a fair, workable, lasting reform to the taxation of housing. Today we back aspiration – the aspiration to save, to work and to own your own home.

‘It is in stark contrast to those who would hit people’s pensions and jobs and homes with higher taxes. That is an approach we entirely reject.

‘Instead we support people who want to work hard and get on – and it is for their sakes that we resolve to stay on course to prosperity.’

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said Labour would deal with the country’s challenges more fairly than Mr Osborne had.

‘People are worse off and the fact is he has failed to balance the books in this parliament,’ he said.

Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable broke Coalition ranks, questioning the Chancellor’s plans to cut the deficit in the next parliament with ‘brutal’ spending cuts rather than tax rises.
