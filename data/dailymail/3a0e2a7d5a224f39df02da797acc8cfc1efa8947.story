World Cup winner Andre Schurrle sparked injury concerns among Chelsea fans as he posted a laid-back image of himself on Twitter watching Borussia Monchengladbach in Europa League action.

Schurrle's image showed vision of the 1-1 draw between the Bundesliga side and La Liga's Villarreal, but a number of his followers were quick to notice the bandage wrapped around his left foot.

The player's post indicated there was little to be concerned about, however. 'Home relaxing and watching some football #feelingbetter,' he said with the image of his view of a TV and his girlfriend Montana Yorke's leg.

The forward showed no signs of a problem as he trained with the Chelsea squad this week but was left out of Jose Mourinho's 18-man squad on Tuesday which drew 1-1 with Schalke in their Champions League Group G opener when Klaas-Jan Huntelaar cancelled out Cesc Fabregas's controversial 11th-minute goal. 

And on Saturday the versatile attacker, who has recently recovered from a leg injury, was hooked from the action by Mourinho in favour of Ramires as Chelsea went to half-time against Swansea at 1-1. They were on level pegging only courtesy of a late Diego Costa equaliser, but went on to a 4-2 victory to maintain their perfect record as Costa added two more to his season's tally.

It's yet to be confirmed if Schurrle has simply been rested and will line up in Chelsea's crunch encounter with Manchester City this weekend with the combination of Fabregas and Costa working a treat for Mourinho.
