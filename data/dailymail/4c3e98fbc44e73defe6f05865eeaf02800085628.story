Hours from death with a brain tumour, Emma Bassett went on a rollercoaster ride – and it saved her life.

The schoolgirl had no idea of the danger she was in when she visited a theme park days before a hospital appointment to discover why she was suffering bad headaches and dizziness.

But when she finally saw the doctors, they told her she had a tumour so big it had stopped vital fluid moving around her brain. The rollercoaster had relieved the build up of pressure by briefly redistributing this liquid.

Survivor: Emma Bassett was hours from death when she was diagnosed with a huge brain tumour at 12 - but has now made an incredible recovery

This had bought her precious extra 
days, and she was able to undergo an operation the next day. Even so, 
doctors warned her that this could leave her in a vegetative state.

But eight years on, Miss Bassett has stunned them all by making a complete recovery.

She has learned to walk and talk all 
over again, and is about to begin a career as a primary school teacher. 
Miss Bassett was 12 when she started to feel unwell and was referred to 
hospital for tests.

The weekend before the appointment, 
her mother Gina took her and a group of friends to Thorpe Park, where 
she rode on the Nemesis Inferno rollercoaster.

Life-threatening surgery: Doctors at St George's Hospital in Tooting told Emma's parents the tumour had been growing in her brain since she was five

At the time she had a satsuma-sized 
tumour blocking the flow of cerebrospinal liquid in her brain. Doctors 
later said the tumour had been growing since she was six and she had 
just hours to live when she went on the ride.

Miss Bassett, now 20, from Twickenham
 in west London, said: 'It was such a shock to discover I'd had this 
tumour growing inside me, probably for years, without me knowing 
anything about it.

Brain scan: The tumour has grown to the size of a satsuma - and was so advanced that young Emma was just hours from death

'The doctors told my parents that I 
would need 24-hour care, because the tumour was wrapped about my brain 
stem, and the surgeons thought removing it would cause irreparable 
damage.

'After the operation, I couldn't walk,
 talk, or even feed myself. But I was determined I'd walk again and beat
 the tumour. It has taken years of hard work, but now, I'm finally able 
to do the things I've always wanted to and live the life I've always 
wanted to lead. At my latest scan, there was no sign of the tumour 
returning, so it's great news.'

Miss Bassett has had numerous 
operations over the past eight years, spending a year with her leg in a 
splint, then two years walking with a crutch.

Long journey: Miss Bassett had to relearn how to walk, talk and eat after the surgery - which doctors feared could leave her in a vegetative state

Lucky to be alive: Miss Bassett is now training to be a primary school teacher and campaigning to raise awareness about the early signs of brain tumours

She then had to have 
special soles put into her shoes to support her walking. But now the 
only sign of the tumour is a slight paralysis on the left side of her 
face.

She said: 'I have had so much 
hydrotherapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy to get me where I am 
today. The doctors thought I might make slight improvements  after my 
operation, but they have since told me they never expected me to come 
anywhere near as far as I have.'

Miss Bassett has now teamed up with 
the Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust to champion their HeadSmart 
campaign, which aims to raise awareness of how to spot the early signs 
of a brain tumour.
