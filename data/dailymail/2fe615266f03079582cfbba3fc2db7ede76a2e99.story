A group of Romanian squatters have been discovered living in a disused public toilet for at least two weeks.

As many as 15 men were found in the small brick building by a council official who went to examine the property before it goes up for auction.

The squatters had transformed the toilets in Edgware, north-west London, into a home by installing a divan bed in the space where the urinals are - as well as a fridge, microwave and cooker.

They managed to tap into the public electricity supply and install plug sockets, while they also carpeted over the floor tiles.

The group of men were discovered by an officer from Harrow Council who was visiting the former toilet, which is about to go on sale with a reserve price of £300,000.

When he arrived the squatters promptly left, but they returned a few days later and the building eventually had to be boarded up to keep them out for good.

Pictures from inside the squat show filthy living conditions, with clothes and rubbish strewn everywhere.

A makeshift shelf running along the length of the urinals boasts a mouldy laptop and a DVD boxset of Rich Man Poor Man, as well an Orthodox Christian icon and a small sewing machine.

A television aerial and clothes can be seen hanging off washing lines and one of the cubicles appears to have been used as a storage cupboard, while they have kept the other as a toilet.

Filth: The counters were covered in the men's possessions and they had crammed a bed into the urinal space

'At one point we were getting reports that there were up to 15 people coming and going,' a council spokesman said.

'We didn't find any passports but found some papers with names suggesting they were Romanian.

'The situation came to light because one of our officers went to make the property ready for marketing, not because we had received any complaints from residents.'

Local residents and businesses seemed largely unaware that the building had been converted into an impromptu home said.

Pharmacy assistant Nilam Morjaria said: 'It's shocking to think that they are so desperate that they want to live in the toilets. But I didn't know anyone was squatting in the building.

'I haven't heard anything about them - nothing about them causing trouble or being a nuisance.

'It shouldn't have been left empty and boarded up so long. It should either have been torn down or sold sooner.'

A local newsagent said she had seen people going in and out of the public toilet, but added: 'I didn't realise that they were actually living there.'

Council leader Susan Hall said: 'This was a public convenience, but it was not meant to be quite that convenient for the squatters who have evidently turned it into a one-bedroom flat.

'What this shows is that the pressures of Eastern European migration are rippling out into suburbia.

'People may be desperate to resort to these measures, but this is a building the council needs to sell to put money into services. As it is, the taxpayer is going to be left spending more than a penny to repair the damage done at this site.'

The building is set to be sold at auction later this month.
