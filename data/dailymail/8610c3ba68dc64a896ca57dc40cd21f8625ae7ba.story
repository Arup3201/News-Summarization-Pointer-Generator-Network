Dunga claims there is a worrying lack of talent coming out of Brazil at the moment as the World Cup winner insists Neneymarymar Jnr is the only star player in his squad.

Exciting attacking players have been synonymous with the Brazil national side throughout history but manager Dunga is concerned by the stuttering production line in recent years.

The 51-year-old was a world champion in 1994 alongside the likes of Romario and a 17-year-old Ronaldo before Rivaldo and then Ronaldinho lit up the world stage.

But, as their shambolic exit from their own World Cup last summer shows, Dunga believes the Brazilian talent factory is drying up, with the exception of Barcelona forward Neymar.

'What is happening in Brazilian football is that we used to have players who scored a lot of goals in Europe and who were points of references, but we no longer have players like that nowadays,' Dunga told SportTV.

'We used to have players like Careca, Ronaldo and Rivaldo, but countries like Portugal and Holland now produce those kinds of players.

'We do not have any players who are really making waves. We only have Neymar at the moment.

'This is very worrying for Brazilian football. We need to have patience, though, and remain calm.'
