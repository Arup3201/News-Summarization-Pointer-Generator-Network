A 10-year-old Maine girl has been charged with killing an infant entrusted to her mother's care to babysit for the night - the youngest person to be hit with a manslaughter rap in the state in at least 25 years.

Three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway of Clinton died on July 8, and the Maine State Police declared the death a homicide on Wednesday.

A day later, authorities reportedly charged the 10-year-old daughter of her babysitter with manslaughter.

The Bangor Daily News of Maine reports that three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway of Clinton died July 8, and the Maine State Police declared the death a homicide Wednesday

Nicole Greenaway, the infant’s mother, 
told The Bangor Daily News medication was found in
her infant’s system which was the very same medication taken by the 
10-year-old girl

Nicole Greenaway, the infant’s mother, told The Bangor Daily News a toxicology report stated a medication was found in the infant’s system that was the very same medication taken by the 10-year-old girl.

'She [also] suffocated her by putting her hands over her face,' Greenaway said Thursday night. 'There are bruises all over her face.'

The mother of the 10-year-old has referred inquiries to her attorney, John Martin of Skowhegan, which was served with a court summons for the 10-year-old to appear in Skowhegan District Court on Oct. 22, according to The Bangor Daily News.

 'She [also] suffocated her by putting her
hands over her face. There are bruises
all over her face.'

The Maine newspaper is not naming the mother in order to protect the identity of the juvenile charged with manslaughter. Police have also reportedly withheld the name of the girl.

The 10-year-old girl is reportedly now in the custody of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, said Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland, who would not disclose how the girl caused the baby’s death.

Nicole Greenaway told The Bangor Daily News the 10-year-old is the daughter of a woman she works with at MaineGeneral Medical Center in Waterville.

Greenaway said the woman was baby-sitting Brooklyn before she died.

'I’m definitely glad they’re finally doing something,' Greenaway told a Bangor Daily News reporter. 'I just didn’t know when they were going to do it. [The last couple of days have been] pretty overwhelming.'

Greenaway, who reportedly has three other children, ages 2, 15 and 16, said the last two months have been full of 'a lot of heartache and a lot of patience.'

  'The decision on charging the girl was 
made after consulting with the attorney general’s office. The state medical examiner’s office 
continues to work on the case.'

McCausland reportedly added that the girl is the youngest person in Maine to be charged with manslaughter in at least 25 years.

'I have not done any research farther out than that,' he told The Bangor Daily News, which wrote that the death of any child under age 3 automatically triggers an investigation in Maine.
