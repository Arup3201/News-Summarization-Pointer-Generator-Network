Andy Murray may have suffered a surprise third-round exit at the Aegon Championships - which he won last year - but his dedicated girlfriend Kim Sears still looked chic supporting her long-term boyfriend courtside.

Kim, who we are more accustomed to seeing in feminine floral dresses, shook up her style today with a more boho-inspired outfit.

Miss Sears, Murray's girlfriend of eight years, grinned widely as she made her way to her seat to watch the 27-year-old play, wearing on-trend £39.99 Aztec print shorts from Zara and a floaty monochrome top.

Courtside chic: Kim Sears, girlfriend of Andy Murray, looked super stylish as she arrived to watch his match against Radek Stepanek in their Men's Singles match on day four of the Aegon Championships at Queens Club - sadly, he lost

She was armed with her new favourite handbag, the £1,395 Ivory Saffiano and Mouse Python by Aspinal of London.

Pippa Middleton and Millie Mackintosh are also lucky enough to own the luxurious handbag in black. 

Kim was seen giggling with Andy's new coach, Amelie Mauresmo, herself a former Wimbledon champion, who was in the front row at Queen's Club, London, a few seats down from Kim.

She also wore her favourite £55 Sterling Silver Charm Bracelet from Pandora 
charm bracelet, which could well be a good luck charm considering she's 
only ever spotted wearing it at Andy's matches. Sadly, it didn't work 
its magic today.

Oh no! She also wore her favourite Pandora charm bracelet, which could well be a god luck charm considering she's only ever spotted wearing it at Andy's matches. Sadly, it didn't work its magic today

The manner of Andy's 7-6 (12-10) 6-2 defeat by Czech Radek Stepanek will not help bolster his confidence ahead of Wimbledon, which kicks off in just ten days.

He squandered eight set points in the opening set before tamely surrendering the second.

The defeat broke the world number five's 19-match winning streak on grass, a sequence that started in 2012 with his Olympic gold in London.

New coach Amelie Mauresmo kept a poker face as the match headed towards a disappointing conclusion but she would have noted the challenge that lies ahead before Murray opens Centre Court proceedings at the All England Club on June 23.

Chatting away: Kim Sears and new coach Amelie Mauresmo had a quick catch-up prior to the match

Murray's dropshots were off target, often falling short of the net, his backhands kept misfiring and there seemed to be a never-ending stream of forehand errors flying off his racket.

If such errors prove costly against a player he had beaten in five of their six previous meetings, Murray's chances of overcoming rivals such as Rafa Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer at the grasscourt major look rather perilous.

A year after completing a Queen's Club-Wimbledon double, the Scot was strangely off-colour as he allowed Stepanek to steal the opening set with a delightful cross-court volley.

Any hopes of a Murray revival fell flat early in the second set when he surrendered the opening game with a forehand error and Stepanek made sure he made the most of his chances.

The wily Czech, who at times gave Murray the runaround, sealed an impressive victory when his opponent sliced a backhand into the net on match point, leaving the crowd stunned and the home favourite frustrated.

'When you play the best in the world you have to come up with the best ... they bring the best out of you and it was a great win for me,' Stepanek said courtside after setting up a quarter-final with South African Kevin Anderson.
