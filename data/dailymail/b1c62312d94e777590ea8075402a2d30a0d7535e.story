Expat Nigel Jackson, 59, has been arrested by police after his wife Brenda Davidson's body was found buried in their garden in Portugal

A British man has been arrested in Portugal after the body of his wife was found buried under a concrete slab in his idyllic country home.

Expat Nigel Jackson, 59, was seized by police after his wife, Brenda Davidson, 73, went missing from their home on the Algarve last November.

Portuguese police were alerted by her son, Dean, who had been concerned over the whereabouts of his mother for several weeks. 

According to neighbours, Jackson had initially said she had returned to the UK 'for treatment for a nasty cough.'

But when she failed to return to their home in Alvor near Portimao he then alerted the authorities and told them he was 'dedicated himself to trying to find her.'

However her son eventually contacted police and Jackson was arrested at their home and questioned by police for several hours.

He then allegedly admitted his wife was dead, led police experts back to his garden and pointed to the spot where his wife was buried.

Forensic officers combed the property and then used pneumatic drills and pick axes to break through a concrete slab in the garden.

Beneath the thick slab they discovered the decomposing remains of the 73-year-old expat at 8.15pm on Tuesday evening. Experts believe she may have been there for some weeks.

Jackson has reportedly admitted to burying his wife but is claiming he did so after the mother-of-four unexpectedly committed suicide at their home.

The investigation is being led by Policia Judiciaria officers based in Portimao - the same squad which has been assisting Scotland Yard officers probing the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.

He is expected to appear before an investigating magistrate in a closed court hearing when the magistrate will decide whether to release him on bail or remand him in custody.

In a statement the Policia Judiciaria said: 'The PJ, through the Criminal Investigation Department in Portimao, identified and arrested a man suspected of the murder of his companion.

'The victim had been living with the arrested man for several years in the Portimao area. The suspect is going to be present at a first court hearing to determine the supervision measures against him.'

He is expected to appear in court as an arguido or formal suspect. Under Portuguese law he has not yet been formally charged with any crime.

A post mortem was due to take place last night to try to determine the cause of death and Jackson remains in police custody for questioning.

The couple moved to the Algarve around 10 years ago from their home in Rochester, Kent and had built up a close set of friends in the close-knit village. 

They had apparently got bored of their life in Kent and Mr Jackson, a former taxi driver, and his wife, a retired cleaner, moved to Portugal for a change of scene.

Neighbours described them as very close and said Mrs Davidson was a 'very caring and loving' woman who was well-respected in the community.
