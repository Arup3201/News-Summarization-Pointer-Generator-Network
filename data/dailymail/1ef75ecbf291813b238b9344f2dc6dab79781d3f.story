If you have ever walked out of a shop laden with bags of treats that you didn’t really need, you may have fallen for one of many marketing tricks designed to make you part with your hard-earned money.

Rounded prices and shops with ‘warm’ scents like cinnamon, encourage shoppers to buy products led by their emotions, according to a group of new studies.

One of them found that colourful adverts make consumers increasingly likely to spend money on more expensive, frivolous items, than monochrome ones.

Scientists have revealed that subtly changing how a shop smells, rounding up prices for emotion-led purchases such as clothing (illustrated with a stock image) and using colourful adverts, can encourage shoppers to buy products, including luxurious items

Researchers from the City University of New York, the Stevens Institute of Technology, New Jersey and Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania have shown for the first time that the ‘temperature’ of scents used in shops affect how much customers buy.

‘People smelling warm fragrances such as cinnamon feel that the room they are in is more crowded, and feel less powerful as a result,’ they said.

‘This can lead them to compensate by buying items they feel are more prestigious.’

They conducted several experiments to test how warm and cool scents affect consumer perception and decision-making, which were detailed in the Journal of Marketing. 

A team of researchers showed that 'warm' scents such as cinnamon (pictured) make consumers feel like they are in more crowded shops and feel less powerful as a result. They found that in such an environment, shoppers were likely to compensate for their lack of power by buying more items, including luxury products

Researchers in Singapore revealed that rounded numbers such as £50 appeal to people who are making emotion-led purchases, such as a camera for their holiday.

Rounded prices encourage shoppers to rely on their feelings, rather than evaluating products, making them perfect for products for holidays, frivolous fashion items and even houses.

However, non-rounded prices, such as £98.76, make consumers more likely to buy utilitarian items, such as a camera to use for a school project, appliances or cleaning products.

The experts said that companies should be aware that small changes in pricing can have a big impact.

When people in a room experienced a ‘warm’ scent such as cinnamon, they felt the room was more crowded than when they experienced a ‘cool’ scent - even though the room contained the same number of people each time.

The people in the ‘warm, crowded’ room felt less powerful as a result of the perceived crowding, and were more likely to compensate for this loss of power by buying items, which they felt were luxurious and helped raise their personal status, the researchers explained.

Shoppers in the warm-scented shop also bought significantly more items overall.

This is despite the fact that the temperature  was never increased.

The scientists believe that their study shows how retailers can easily encourage people to buy more high-end items, just by changing fragrance.

Similarly, a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that rounded numbers such as £50 appeal to shoppers and make them more likely to buy ‘emotional’ products, than if they are priced at £49.99, for example.

‘A rounded price - $100 - encourages consumers to rely on feelings when evaluating products, while a non-rounded price - $98.76 - encourages consumers to rely on reason,’ researchers Monica Wadhwa of INSEAD, Singapore and Kuangjie Zhang of Nanyang Technological University said.

‘When a purchase is driven by feelings, rounded prices lead to a subjective experience of feeling right.’ 

A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that rounded numbers such as £50 appeal to shoppers and make them more likely to buy ‘emotional’ products such as clothing (illustrated with a stock image), than if they are priced at £49.99, for example

Five studies revealed that rounded prices make consumers more likely to buy a product when a purchase is primarily driven by feelings, such as buying a camera for a family holiday.

However, non-rounded prices ($98.76) make consumers more likely to buy the same product when a purchase is utilitarian, such as buying a camera to use for a school project.

The experts said that companies should be aware that small changes in pricing can have a big impact, so that products for holidays, frivolous fashion items and even houses could benefit from rounded prices.

Meanwhile, companies selling practical products such as appliances and cleaning products could benefit from precise prices such as £29.58, for example.

Another study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research, said that when it comes to getting consumers to part with more of their cash, colourful adverts are more effective than monochrome ones.

‘Black-and-white images can lead consumers to focus on the abstract, essential, and defining components of a product,’ according to a group of researchers at Ohio State University.

Treating yourself to a coveted gadget or luxurious item of clothing after a break-up may seem like a good idea, but a new study claims that so-called retail therapy makes people dwell on their failure.

A joint study by the Erasmus University, Cornell, Northwestern and New York University found that consumers who buy premium goods after a failure are masking the problem, rather than recovering - and could even make things worse.

The researchers said: ‘When consumers experience a psychological threat to how they would like to see themselves, buying products that signal accomplishment in the same area of their life could ironically cause them to dwell on their shortcomings.

‘This can strip consumers of their mental resources and impair their self-control.’

The study invited participants to recall a time when their intelligence was undermined and what they did about it.

It found that those who opted for a form of retail therapy were unhappier in the longer term.

‘Consumption can sometimes compensate for our blunders and failures, but this doesn’t always work,’ the researchers said.

‘Consumers who use products to boost their sense of self-worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings and their ability to exert self-control is impaired.

‘After experiencing a setback in one area of their life, consumers might be better off boosting their sense of self in a different area of their life.

‘For example, a consumer whose intelligence is undermined might be better off signalling their self-worth socially rather than trying to assert their intelligence.’

The study was published in the Journal of Consumer Research.

When it comes to getting consumers to part with more of their cash, colourful adverts (an example is pictured) are more effective than monochrome ones, which can lead consumers to focus on practical features

US researchers have shown or the first time that the ‘temperature’ of scents used in shops affect how much customers buy.

'Warm' smalls such as cinnamon make a shop feel more crowded and consumers fell less powerful as a result.

They explained that this makes shoppers compensate by buying more luxurious items - and more products overall.

The scientists believe that their study shows how retailers can easily encourage people to buy more high-end items, just by changing fragrance.

‘In contrast, colour images can draw attention to the concrete, sometimes unimportant and idiosyncratic features of the product.’

In one experiment, consumers were shown either monochrome or colour pictures of four shoes - plain sneakers, leopard print sneakers, plain heels and leopard print heels.

They were asked to separate them into two groups.

Consumers who saw the black-and-white pictures were more likely to categorise the shoes based on their function – high heels for looking glamorous and sneakers for exercise – instead of separating them by plain versus pattern.

The study shows that the consumers looking at the monochrome images tended to focus on basic and practical product features.

Consequently, the study suggests that colourful adverts have the power to distract consumers from thinking about practical features, such as a car’s efficiency, and instead pay more for unnecessary features, such as a flashy stereo.

‘Colour has become dominant in marketing because it attracts attention and promotes favourable attitudes,’ they said.

‘However, there may be times when companies might prefer to use black-and-white advertising. If a product’s primary features are superior, companies can successfully promote the product by using black-and-white images.

‘On the other hand, if a product’s secondary features are superior, companies should consider using colour images to draw attention to these otherwise easily overlooked features’.
