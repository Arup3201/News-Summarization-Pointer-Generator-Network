A man who dropped out of university to start his own computer gaming business has sold the company for £20million.

Craig Fletcher started Multiplay in his bedroom at his parents' home in Blackfield, Hampshire, some 20 years ago.

The 36-year-old has now sold the company - whose 50 employees include Mr Fletcher's mother and brother - to video game retailer Game Digital.

Remaining modest, Mr Fletcher said he plans to use the money from the sale to buy a new house for himself and girlfriend Pippa Caygill - and to pay off his brothers' mortgages.

In 1994, when competitive online gaming was in its infancy, Mr Fletcher organised his first tournament, where 20 of his friends played first-person shooter Doom II at a Southampton hotel. 

He continued to organise weekend events while studying medicine at Edinburgh University, but they soon attracted hundreds of people and the hobby began placing more demands on his time.    

Mr Fletcher said: 'I originally started it as a hobby, something that I did for fun. I got to my final year of medical school and realised it was getting silly.

'I'd fly down on a Wednesday to organise an event with hundreds of people at the weekend and then head back for exams. I had to give the company a shot.'

He dropped out of university in 2001 to work on Multiplay full-time and his mother, father and brother joined the business.

Working out of the family's four-bedroom home in Langley, the team continued to grow the business.  

Now, the company has 50 members of staff at their headquarters in Southampton, Hampshire. 

And more than 10 million users from around the world connect to Multiplay each month to play popular games like Minecraft and the Battlefield series.

Mr Fletcher's father, Tom, 72, has retired from the company, but his 67-year-old mother Yvonne continues to work as the office secretary.

Mr Fletcher said the money made from selling the business will go towards paying off the mortgages of his brothers Paul, 48, and Stewart, 47, who works for Multiplay as operations director.  

He added that he and his partner, Pippa Caygill, 30, a urology surgical registrar, will likely move to a new home near Romsey, Hampshire.  

He said: 'We're very happy. This is a reward for those of us who have risked an awful lot. It recognises the hard work that everybody puts in.

'I honestly haven't thought about how else I'll spend the money, I'm more focused on getting the business out there. I did sneak a look at a few cars, though.'

Mr Fletcher, who currently drives a Jaguar Xf, has been looking at Aston Martins, his mother said.

He added  that a lot of the cash will be reinvested in new equipment.

'The sky's the limit. We have had a rocket put under us and we're going to be growing very fast,' he said. 

'I wouldn't be surprised if there were 150 people working here in three years' time. We've got some big ambitions.' 

With the business initially revolving around him playing online and establishing contacts, now he hardly has any time to play games himself as work takes over.

He said: 'The last game I played quite a lot was Eve Online [an online multiplayer game set in space]. I exist so that other people can play.'

He added: 'Who knew this little tech company could grow so fast and do so much?

'We have been working with Game for quite a while. They were the first exhibitor who came to one of our shows.

Events: Multiplay also organises gaming events including the Insomnia festival (pictured) - labelled the 'Glastonbury of the gaming world' - which saw 67,000 people attend last year and 1.4 million participate online

'They approached us. It almost happened as part of a conversation and it got to point where it was actually happening.

'For the first time in my life I will have a boss. Up until now it's been my mum.'

His audience is expected to grow by at least 17 million people, the number of people with an online subscription to Game.

Multiplay also organises gaming events including the Insomnia festival - labelled the 'Glastonbury of the gaming world' - which saw 67,000 people attend last year and 1.4 million participate online.

Martyn Gibbs, chief executive of Game Digital, said: 'The world of live events, eSports and multiplayer gaming is growing rapidly and one we have been looking to enter for some time.

'By acquiring Multiplay we are benefitting from nearly two decades of experience, during which time Multiplay has built an exceptional reputation and leading position in its markets.

'Multiplay has a great management team and a fantastic culture - their passion and enthusiasm for games is infectious.'
