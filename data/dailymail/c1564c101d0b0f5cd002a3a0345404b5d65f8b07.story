A police watchdog has decided that tasering a man who then suffered a life-threatening heart attack was justified.

James McCarthy, 23, is suing Merseyside Police after he was hit twice with a Taser at a hotel in Liverpool in September last year.

His solicitor Sophie Khan said: 'James McCarthy does not accept the findings of the IPCC investigation. He disputes that the Taser use was justified.

Warning: Medics told the police watchdog the use of Taser nay have led to a 22-year-old suffering a serious heart attack

'My client suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of the Taser and sustained a serious injury following the incident.

'Mr McCarthy is now pursuing a civil 
claim against Merseyside Police for damages. Mr McCarthy has asked for 
his privacy to be respected whilst he recovers for his injury.'

Police watchdog the Independent 
Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said that use of the stun guns was 
justified, but that one of the officers involved should have more 
training.

The team was called to a Premier Inn 
in Albert Dock at around 2.50am on September 30 last year where a group 
of men were fighting.

Mr McCarthy was hit twice, including by one discharge that lasted 11 seconds, and suffered a cardiac arrest.

Tasers are being fired up to five times a day in the UK as police officers rely increasingly on the potentially deadly stun guns.

There has been a huge investment in the 50,000-volt weapons in the decade since they were introduced, and police chiefs estimate they are now fired as often as 1,800 times a year.

Senior officers are bracing for criticism as use of the stun guns soars.

Figures published earlier this month show the number of confrontations involving Tasers more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, from 3,500 to 7,250.

There are 14,700 officers trained to use Tasers, after their availability was expanded from highly trained marksmen to specialist units and beat officers.

Because of the potential threat of 
violence, the IPCC found that using the stun guns was 'proportionate and
appropriate', but that one officer was not aware of how long he was 
passing electric current through the Taser and there was a delay in 
checking whether Mr McCarthy was OK.

The IPCC said that medical staff told
them that the cardiac arrest could have been caused by the Taser, but 
that the presence of cocaine and cannabis in his system and raised 
adrenaline levels could have contributed.

IPCC commissioner James 
Dipple-Johnstone said: 'It is a difficult judgment to make in the heat 
of an incident, but it is important for public confidence that police 
officers are able to account for their decision to use force, including 
Taser, and that any force used against the public is at the minimum 
level required.

'In this case, officers responded to a
violent situation involving a number of people.

'Our investigation found
they had valid concerns for both their safety and that of the public 
and, as such, use of force including Taser was reasonable.

'However, our investigation did 
identify areas for improvement in how long the Taser was used for and 
how long it took for welfare checks to be made by officers when the 
subject of the Taser use was restrained and suffering a medical 
emergency.

'We have shared these with the police so that they can be considered in future training of officers.'
