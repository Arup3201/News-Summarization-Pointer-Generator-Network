The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met before they became students at St Andrews University, according to royal biographer Katie Nicholl.

The writer discovered the pair had met through friends before they enrolled at the Scottish university as she researched her book, Kate: The Future Queen.

In an interview with U.S. TV host Katie Couri, Nicholl said it was Kate's former school friends at Marlborough College who told her the new twist in the royal love story.

Royal romance: The couple, who are now married with a son, didn't first meet at university as previously believed

She said: 'This was really fascinating for me. I was speaking to some of her friends at Marlborough College, which was where she went before St Andrews, and they said, "Uh uh, she didn't meet him at St Andrews. She met him before she got there... through some of her friends. They knew Prince William and Prince Harry."

'So there was an early meeting.'

Nicholl said the knowledge of the early meeting 'changed everything' in her approach to writing her book.

Graduates: The Duke and Duchess both studied a history of art but Kate hadn't originally intended to go to St Andrews

She said it was 'interesting' in light of the new information that the Duchess, 31, decided to study at St Andrews as she had originally intended to go to Edinburgh University.

However, she rejected the place offered to her there, took a gap year and instead reapplied to St Andrews after it was announced it was where William would study.

Nicholl said: 'It was a big risk - applicants to St Andrews had shot up by nearly 50 percent when the Palace announced that Prince William was going there.'

Course of true love: It was confirmed the pair were dating in 2004 after they had become housemates while at university

It was her appearance in the St Andrews University charity fashion show in a see-through dress that was said to help capture the Prince's heart and they went on to tie the knot in 2011

Kate did get a place and she started a course in the history of art in 2001. Prince William was doing a joint honours degree in the history of art and geography, meaning some of their lessons overlapped. They also had rooms in the same hall of residence.

As the world knows, the pair became friends, then roommates and the news they were dating was confirmed in 2004.

Famously, it was Kate's appearance in the university fashion show in a see-through dress that helped her capture the Prince's heart.

After a brief split in 2007, the couple then married in 2011 and in July had their first child, Prince George of Cambridge.
