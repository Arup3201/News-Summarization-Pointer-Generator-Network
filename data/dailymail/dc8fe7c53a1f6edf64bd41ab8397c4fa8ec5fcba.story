When Saracens and Harlequins resume hostilities on Saturday afternoon with a place in the Aviva Premiership final at stake, the match will serve as a high-profile stage for an intriguing leadership duel.

England captains past and present will go head-to-head at Allianz Park. Steve Borthwick v Chris Robshaw is the subplot which may go a long way to defining this London derby.

These are men who have both encountered turbulence in the glare of public scrutiny, but who are hugely respected within the game and revered as figureheads at their respective clubs.

Both wield considerable influence, though their careers are at very different stages. Borthwick is two or three games from retirement; the uncertainty reflecting the winner-takes-all nature of this play-off for a place at Twickenham.

For Saracens’ 34-year-old second-row forward, the end of this season could see a glorious climax to a decorated career.

For 27-year-old Robshaw, much lies ahead. As the incumbent England captain, he reinforced his status during an impressive Six Nations campaign to banish the uncertainty which had previously stalked him in the role.

If Robshaw leads Quins to May 31’s Premiership final, England coach Stuart Lancaster will appoint a stand-in leader for the Test series opener against New Zealand in Auckland, but the armband will be Robshaw’s again when he is available.

So what of this semi-final match-up? One
 man with a unique perspective is Lewis Moody, who  succeeded Borthwick 
as England captain in 2010 and preceded Robshaw in the job.

‘Steve as a
 captain is very similar to his character... very intense and meticulous
 in his preparation, certainly when it comes to the line-out and 
restarts,’ said Moody.

Intense: Borthwick's athleticism around lineouts and restarts is second to none

‘Those are his specialist areas. His athleticism in those areas is still second to none. In terms of his work on the pitch, he is a pivotal figure for  Saracens. I don’t think you can compare the two in terms of the work they get through, because Chris’s impact on the game in that way is far more significant than Steve’s, but Steve is still a crucial figure.

‘He makes all the decisions and is the character who drives standards. You could see Chris’s impact last weekend in the game against Bath when he was man of the match. He just gets through so much work.

‘He’s not always the stand-out player and he’s not the guy who is going to make a 50-metre break, but he will give 100 per cent in every match. He’s so valuable to the teams he plays in.’

There is a perception that both Borthwick and Robshaw can be categorised as players who lead by understated example, but Moody suggested that  there are clear variations in their approach.

‘It will be a great battle between two contrasting individuals,’ he said. ‘Steve is more of a talker and has been a leader for a long time now. When he was England  captain I thought he was quite unlucky, because he actually did a brilliant job, as he does now for Saracens.

‘He understands the game and the areas that he can influence.

Workrate: Robshaw may not always be the standout but his impact on games is remarkable, says Moody

‘He is certainly  not a Lawrence Dallaglio, full of bravado, but his character has changed as captain over the years and these days he seems to be more vocal. If things go wrong he’s the one pointing the finger and he also antagonises the opposition.

‘If either is the lead-by-example type, it is Robshaw. He’s not really an orator but you can definitely see his confidence has grown in the role during his tenure with England.

‘He is making decisions quickly without relying on the other leadership guys around him so much. He is clear in his own mind now. I think he learned a massive amount from the tough times he went through after games against Australia and South Africa a couple of years ago. He has really developed as a captain and makes good decisions now.’

Borthwick is often damned with faint praise, despite ringing endorsements from those he works with. He is regarded as a work-horse and a player’s player, limited to low-key endeavour, but Saracens are diminished without him, as are Quins without Robshaw.

‘All the stats can be irrelevant,’ said Moody. ‘Especially at club level, there are individuals in a team who are absolutely intrinsic to its success. A good example of that is Bath’s captain, Stuart Hooper. He is never the stand-out player but that team wouldn’t be where they are without him driving standards, performance and attitudes.

‘Guys like Steve and Stu really set the standard but that is something that might not be recognised by people outside the club.’

Robshaw’s challenge was to convince sceptics he was the best candidate to wear England’s No 7 shirt. He has tackled that task with defiant gusto, in the same way that a previous, acclaimed openside for the national team once did.

‘Early on, he wasn’t considered really to be an international player and he used that frustration a bit like Neil Back did,’ said Moody.

Robshaw has great admiration for his adversary today - praising Borthwick’s enduring influence, longevity and professionalism, and the way he recovered from some tough times with England.

‘I made my England debut under Steve,’ he said. ‘He is a brilliant captain and a brilliant man. There haven’t been many line-out operators as good and to play at the top level for as long as he has shows what a good player he has been.

‘He was involved with England when things weren’t going so well but he has come through that and gone on to win the Premiership with Saracens. Now he’s about to play in a Heineken Cup final. ‘I have a huge amount of respect for what he has achieved.’

That respect will be shelved for 80 minutes this afternoon. For all their respective qualities, only one fine leader can survive this knock-out showdown.
