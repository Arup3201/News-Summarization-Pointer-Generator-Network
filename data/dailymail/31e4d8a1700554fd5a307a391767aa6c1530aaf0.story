Three people have died after a small plane crashed into the only vacant lot in a dense Chicago suburb.

The twin-engine Beechcraft Baron crashed in Palos Hills on Sunday evening, shortly after takeoff from Chicago Midway Airport as it headed towards Lawrence, Kansas.

The aircraft is believed to have experienced mechanical difficulties with residents hearing the engine 'splutter' while it flew overhead.

Authorities have said the pilot may have desperately tried to find a place to crash that would avoid casualties on the ground.

Investigation: The National Transportation Safety said there is no obvious reasons why the twin-engine plane crashed shortly after taking off from Midway Airport 

Palos Hills Deputy Police Chief James Boie said: 'There's only one empty lot in the whole neighborhood and that's where the plane came down. 

'Some of the residents said they heard an airplane. It sounded like it was kind of sputtering and then it came down right away. It did come close to one of the houses.'

He said he had no immediate identification of the victims, adding a medical examiner was at the site Monday morning. 

About two blocks all around had been cordoned off by authorities. But he said there was no fire at the time of the crash and no evacuation ordered, though some people were kept away from their homes after the crash.

Lunsford said in an earlier email that the FAA had sent a team to investigate and the National Transportation Safety Board had been notified. So far they have found nothing that would point to the cause of why the plane went down. 

Boie said planes from Midway often fly overhead, but he recalled no incident in recent memory of a small plane crash in the community southwest of downtown Chicago.

Michael D'Alessio, who lives with his family a few blocks away from the crash, told The Chicago Tribune he woke up after hearing the sound of the plane going down and called 911 immediately.

'It was very loud,' D'Alessio said. 'I heard a loud pop. . .Planes fly over our area all the time. But this was different.'

When D'Alessio went outside to see what happened, he passed by an airplane seat lying on the ground near the crash.

According to Fox News 32, air traffic control at Midway struggled to contact the pilot via their radio.

The operator asked a number of times for the pilot to respond, but there was nothing. 

Flights at Midway have only just returned to normal after the air traffic control center was disabled by a former employee setting fire to it.

The sabotage caused traffic chaos around the country.
