Fighting for life: Jack Powell, 18, passed his test three weeks ago and is now on life support after a crash which killed his friend, Kiri Jade, 14, and the passenger in another car, Barbara Ford, 67

A 14-year-old girl has been killed in a car crash just three weeks after her teenage driver passed his driving test.

Kiri Jade was the front-seat passenger in the Renault Clio when it collided with a Renault Megane yesterday afternoon.

Driver Jack Powell, 18, is on life support and remains in a coma expected to last for days.

A second passenger, Georgia James, 13, broke both her legs in the crash on the Isle of Wight.

Three fire engines, two ambulances, a rapid-response paramedic and an air ambulance arrived at the scene within minutes, when Kiri, from Sandown, Isle of Wight, was pronounced dead.

Jack and Georgia were airlifted to Southhampton General Hospital, where Jack was put on life support and Georgia had surgery on both her legs, which were broken in the crash.

The 67-year-old male driver of the Megane and his wife, Barbara Ford, also 67, were taken to St Mary’s Hospital in Newport, Isle of Wight.

Today, Mrs Ford died of her injuries.

On December 14, 2013 - just three weeks ago - a photo posted on Facebook showed the proud teenager holding his driving test certificate.

A post by Jack’s driving instructor 
read: 'Congratulations Jack Powell on a great first time pass this 
morning with just 4 minor marks.

'Going to miss the football banter with you, c’mon the Reds! Take care mate.'

An
 eye witness who was at the scene just moments after the crash at 3.17pm
 in Newchurch on the island said: 'It looked as though there was a body 
lying in the road when I arrived.

'It’s a fast section of road and there’s a tight left bend at the bottom of the hill near where the cars collided.

'The road wasn’t particularly wet - I had just driven on it before.'

A Facebook page set up in support of Jack and Georgia and has attracted over 740 ‘likes’ in just seven hours.

Jack and Georgia were airlifted to Southampton General Hospital following the crash at 3.17pm

Friends and family were leaving 
messages of condolence and support for the youngsters who remain at 
Southampton General Hospital.

The page is called ‘Jack Powell £jp1 Keep Fighting’ and has a profile picture of the young driver playing football.

Jack, also from Sandown on the island, worked at his family-run newsagents in the town called P&J Newsagents.

The ‘£jp1’ is a reference to the youngster’s football position as a goalkeeper for a local club.

Tributes have flooded in on a Facebook page set up for Jack and Georgia as they are treated in hospital

A post by Jeanette Powell, understood to be driver Jack Powell’s mother, read: 'Jack is having more scans. The machines are breathing for him.

'They have told us he will be in a coma for days. Thanks for all your support. Please keep praying.'

Meanwhile, a family member of Georgia’s wrote on her page: 'Hey everyone I’m just writing to say Georgia is okay.

'She has a broken thigh bone. Both 
legs and is having a operation tonight... Thank you for all you posts 
I’m sure she will love them xxxx.'
