The extent to which Malky Mackay’s astonishing text messages were riddled with abuse has been described as ‘shocking’ by Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen in the latest damning condemnation of the Scot.

Football has rounded on the former Cardiff City manager and Iain Moody since Sportsmail uncovered a range of racist, sexist and homophobic exchanges between the pair.

The developments of the last five days cost the 42-year-old a return to management with Crystal Palace and saw Moody resign as sporting director at Selhurst Park.

Aftermath: Caretaker manager Keith Millen says Crystal Palace are suffering from the Malky Mackay saga

Out: Malky Mackay was close to becoming the Eagles' next boss before Sportsmail revealed offensive texts

Mackay was ready to be unveiled as Palace’s manager on Wednesday and given plenty of assistance in the transfer market to bring in much-needed reinforcements.

That job has now been left with Millen, who is in caretaker charge following Tony Pulis’s departure on the eve of the season.

Millen said: ‘I don’t know how far down the line we were in terms of agreeing for him (Mackay) to be our manager but for all this to come out was shocking.

‘It’s not right what has been said. We knew there was something between Iain, Malky and Cardiff when they left but that all looked to have settled down. Iain is very good at his job but the stuff out there isn’t right.

West Ham scored three goals away from home for the first time since beating Tottenham on October 6 

‘It’s a shame. Malky is a good football person and a good manager. I’m sure he will be (a good manager) again.’

Palace are innocent bystanders in this rumpus but the trouble it has caused was encapsulated on Saturday against West Ham. The Eagles, by Millen’s admission, were ‘fragile’ and had the ‘stuffing knocked out’ of them.

The chief beneficiary of the incendiary revelations surrounding Mackay could have been Millen, but he saw his side gift goals in a deflating defeat to lay bare the problems Pulis has left behind.

Strikes from Mauro Zarate, Stewart Downing and Carlton Cole deflated the mood, with Marouane Chamakh’s drive scant consolation.

After a gallant display at Arsenal on the opening day, this was hardly the ringing endorsement Millen craved from his players. ‘The way this week has materialised is tough to take. It has been very confusing for what we were trying to do,’ he said.

After Tim Sherwood ruled himself out of the job, Palace co-chairman Steve Parish must begin the hunt all over again. Millen added: ‘It’s not ideal. The board had done their homework and spoken to people. There are plenty who would want it.’

Those include Colombia boss Jose Pekerman and ex-Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, but neither possess the Premier League pedigree Parish wants. He is prepared to wait — it took more than a month to appoint Pulis — and has told Millen he may have to hold tight.
