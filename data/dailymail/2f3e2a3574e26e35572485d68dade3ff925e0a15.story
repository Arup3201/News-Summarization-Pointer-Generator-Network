Boca Juniors striker Dani Osvaldo took team celebrations to a whole new level on Wednesday night.  

After scoring his side's fourth goal in a 5-0 routing of Venezuelan club Zamora in the Copa Libertadores, the Argentina-born Italy international ushered his team-mates into an elaborate group 'selfie', taken by a Boca coach.

The man on loan from Southampton then added a second goal to his tally to complete an emphatic win for Boca, who have won all three of their group stage games in the competition so far.

Boca Juniors have won all three of their group stage games in the Copa Libertadores this year 

Osvaldo joined Southampton from Roma in August 2013 for a club-record £15million fee. However, after a string of disciplinary problems and a struggle to adapt to the English game, he was loaned out to Juventus during the following January transfer window.

For the 2014-15 season, Osvaldo was loaned to Inter Milan as part of an exchange deal for Saphir Taider. 

At Inter, Osvaldo's form improved and he scored seven goals in 18 appearances, but his poor disciplinary record persisted, as the striker was suspended for failing to turn up to training two days in a row. This led to the early termination of his contract with the club.

Osvaldo joined current club Boca in February this year and so far has three goals in four appearances.

The Italian striker is currently on loan from Southampton and has scored three goals in four games
