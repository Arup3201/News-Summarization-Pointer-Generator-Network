A woman accused of brutally slashing and shooting her one-time boyfriend to death in his shower won an American Idol-style singing contest in prison while awaiting trial for his murder.

Dressed in uniform prison stripes Jodi Arias performed O'Holy Night and beat 50 other inmates in the Christmas carol competition at the Maricopa County jail in December 2010.

Her prize was a stocking full of presents and a turkey dinner for her and her cellmates.

Jodi Arias' trial started yesterday. If convicted of the murder of her ex-boyfriend she may become America's fourth woman on death row

It
came two years after she was arrested for the murder of boyfriend Travis
Alexander who she is accused of killing months after he split up 
with her.

Her trial started yesterday and if convicted she could become fourth woman on America's death row.

Alexander,
a 30-year-old Mormon motivational speaker, was found stabbed 27 times, 
with his throat slit and with a bullet in his head at his home in Mesa, 
Arizona days after the savage attack.

'This
is not a case of whodunit. The person who did this killing sits in 
court today and it is the defendant Jodi Ann Arias,' prosecutor Juan 
Martinez told the Arizona courtroom on Wednesday.

Arias,
a photographer who had dated Alexander for nearly five months in 2007, 
has been in jail since her arrest. She has pleaded not-guilty to first 
degree murder.

Her day in court: Jodi Arias has changed the timeline of events repeatedly but has most recently admitted that she did kill her ex-boyfriend but allegedly did so in self defense

Accused: Jodi Arias, 32, faces the death penalty after allegedly murdering her ex-boyfriend, right

But investigators and Alexander's 
friends maintain that Arias became bitterly jealous and 'obsessed' with 
him after the break up, and even stalked him in the months leading up to
his death.

The prosecution is arguing that Arias
killed her ex-boyfriend after finding out that he had moved on and 
planned to take his new girlfriend on a trip to Mexico.

'This love, well she rewarded that 
love for Travis Victor Alexander by sticking a knife in his chest. And 
he was a good man, well she slit his throat as a reward for being a good
man,' Mr Martinez said.

The defense is painting an entirely 
different picture of Alexander, saying that his relationship with Arias 
was abusive and she killed him in self defense.

'Obsessed': The couple only dated for five months before breaking up over jealous issues, she said

Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference

'Had Jodi not been forced to defend 
herself, none of us would be here. In that one minute, had Jodi not 
chosen to defend herself she would not be here,' defense attorney 
Jennifer Willmott said.

The couple had met at a work 
conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the 
phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 
emails.

They started dating
in 
February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be 
baptised into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias 
telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.

In jail: Arias claimed she had nothing to do with the murder but later said it was out of self defense

In December 2007, Alexander 
began dating another girl and allegedly told friends that Arias became so jealous that she 
slashed the tyres on his car twice.

In June 2008, Alexander told friends he thought Arias might have hacked 
into his Facebook account and told her to stay away.

Yet on June 4, she visited his home and they had sex before he was murdered. She later told police that they had maintained a secret sexual relationship despite breaking up, ABC reported.

'There's nothing about her that I see in
marriage material - or wife material,' Alexander had said, according to 
his friend, Dave Hall. 'But it's hard to say no to a woman that sneaks 
into your house, crawls in your bed and tries to, you know, seduce you.'

At first she denied being at his 
house the day he was killed, yet police found a camera in 
Alexander's washing machine containing graphic pictures of the pair having sex.

The water-logged camera, which belonged to
Alexander, had been damaged in the washing machine, but the Mesa police crime lab was able to recover images, some of which had been deleted.

Among those deleted were pictures showing Alexander posing naked in the shower at 5.22pm, with the last picture
showing him alive at 5.30pm. Later photos showed him bleeding 
while on the floor.

The camera also contained pictures of Arias posing naked on
Alexander's bed at 1.40pm.

On June 9, his friends went to his upscale home after he had failed to return their calls. They found him dead in his shower and his body was 'well into the decomposition process'.

Troubled: Alexander's friends said she stalked him in the months before his death and slashed his tires

Missed: Alexander, a motivational speaker from Arizona, was found several days after the killing

Wounds show that Alexander attempted 
to fight back, court records show. An autopsy found he sustained 27 puncture 
wounds and one gunshot wound, with the bullet found in his left cheek.

Investigators also found a bloody left palm print with Arias' DNA on the bathroom wall. Her DNA was also found 
in hair recovered from a bloody wall, according to the Arizona Republic.

After initially claiming that she had not been at his home that day, Arias changed her story to admit she had been there - but had not killed her ex-boyfriend.

'I witnessed Travis being attacked by 
two other individuals,' she told Inside Edition. 'Who were they? I 
don't know. I couldn't pick them up in a police lineup.'

Deceit: Police found a camera in Alexander's washing machine, pictured, that contained pictures of him having sex with Arias on the day of the killing. There were also pictures of his dead body

She later changed her story once 
again, telling the court that she killed Alexander in self defense after
he became angry when she dropped his camera.

She claims he had been sexually and physically abusive throughout their relationship.

'It makes me sick because I know her 
true side,' Steven Alexander, Travis Alexander's brother, told ABC. 'And I ask people to please not buy into 
this sweet innocent personality that she puts on.'

As well as the inconsistencies in her story, Arias' case has been plagued with difficulties with her legal representation.Â 

She asked to represent herself but 
when she submitted letters to the court that she claimed Alexander had 
written - saying he was a pedophile - they were found to be forgeries, and she told a judge she was in 'over her head'.

In court: Arias has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder but prosecutors want the death penalty

Her defense team was reinstated but in December 2011, her attorney, Victoria Washington, was granted a motion to withdraw from the case.

Jennifer Willmott, a death penalty-qualified defense attorney, had now been assigned to represent Arias. In Janauary 2012, a judge denied a motion asking for the death penalty to be rejected.
