Tragic Freddie Perry was knocked down and killed while talking on his mobile phone near his home in Didcot, Oxfordshire

A boy aged ten was fatally injured 
outside a school as he chatted on his mobile phone and did not see a 
car  being driven by a teacher.

A coroner heard that Freddie Perry was knocked down by the car, although the driver was exonerated of any blame.

The
 schoolboy was playing with a friend just yards from his home when he 
was hit by Joanne Napper’s Nissan Micra, the inquest was told yesterday.

The friend told police that Freddie received a call on his phone and 
answered it as he ran out between parked cars, oblivious of Miss 
Napper’s car.

The teacher 
was travelling at 20mph and said there was nothing she could have done 
to prevent the accident, with parked vehicles blocking her view.

Freddie,
 a keen Harry Potter and boxing fan, was taken to John Radcliffe 
Hospital in Oxford on September 10 last year, but died the next day.

Speaking after the inquest, Freddie’s father, coach driver Lea Perry, 
said the family did not blame Miss Napper for the tragedy.

‘We don’t 
feel angry towards the lady,’ he said.

‘She has got to live with it. We 
have got to live with it. It is hell.’

Mr
 Perry said pupils at Stephen Freeman Community Primary School in 
Didcot, Oxfordshire, where Freddie had been in Year 6, had dressed a 
teddy bear in a uniform and put it in his seat. ‘They can’t bear for him
 not to be there,’ he said.

Tributes to Freddie Perry left at the side of the road where he was knocked down in September last year

The inquest in Oxford heard that Freddie was playing with a friend at 5.30pm on a green near the family home in Didcot.

In
 evidence, PC Naomi Hames said the friend saw Freddie holding the phone 
to his ear when he disappeared around the side of a parked vehicle 
seconds before the collision.

She said: ‘He was running a bit faster 
than jogging.’

At the same 
time Miss Napper was travelling down the road, having just left Didcot 
Girls’ School where Freddie’s sister, Eloise, 12, had joined just a week
 earlier.

She said  there were a lot of cars parked on the side of the road.

Freddie's family have since launched a road safety campaign to get a crossing built on the road and have raised thousands of pounds for charity

She
 described seeing a young boy running into the road out of the corner of
 her eye. ‘I slammed on my brakes as soon as I saw him,’ Miss Napper 
said. ‘It was the only thing I could do to try and avoid him. I didn’t 
see him prior to that due to the parked vehicles.’

Freddie
 was hit by the front left wing of the car and thrown into the air. 
Forensic collision investigator Andrew Evans said Miss Napper would not 
have been able to prevent the accident.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said it was an ‘extremely tragic incident’.
