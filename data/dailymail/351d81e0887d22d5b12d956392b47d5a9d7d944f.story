Spain's smallest ever top-flight side have made an impressive start to life in La Liga and on Saturday Eibar picked up another important point at home to Levante.

But, unlike most of their nine points so far, this one wasn't based on defensive solidity, but on attacking flair.

Midfielder Saul Berjon scored a Goal of the Season contender, volleying home in a style reminiscent of Manchester United legend Paul Scholes.

A free-kick was chipped over the Levante defence to the edge of the box where Saul adjusted his body and fired a stunning rising volley past the keeper leveling the score at 2-2.

Eibar, a team from a town of under 30,000 people, had conceded just four goals in three games before Saturday's game against struggling Levante.

But the newly promoted side went 2-0 down before half-time, and had to fight back, getting back to 2-2 before requiring a last-gasp equaliser to secure a 3-3 draw.

Eibar fought back twice, eventually leveling through Federico Piovaccari in the last minute to earn a draw
