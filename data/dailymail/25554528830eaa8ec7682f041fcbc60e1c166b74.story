Female Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land isn't going put up with accusations that she'd work against women if elected.

The Michigan Republican shot down claims that Republicans are engaged in a 'War on Women' in a snarky new ad released Tuesday morning.

In the ad, Land, former Michigan Secretary of State, makes fun of her male opponent, three-term Rep. Gary Peters, for attacking her on women's issues, boasting, 'as a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters.'

Battle of the Sexes: Michigan Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land, a Republican, mocks her male opponent, Democratic Rep. Gary Peters, in a new ad for claiming she would work against women if elected

'Really? Think about that for a moment,' Land asks before taking a sip of coffee, shaking her head disapprovingly and looking at her watch

Land and Peters, a Democrat, are vying to replace retiring Democratic lawmaker Carl Levin in the U.S. Senate. Polling shows the two candidates in a dead heat.

Neither Peters nor his allies have outright used the 'War on Women' jab at Land. Both have knocked Land for opposing the health reform law, though, which Democrats say offers women better access to care than Republican alternatives.

Peters spokeswoman Haley Morris told the Detroit Free Press last month that Land would “cut access to preventative health services like mammograms, cancer screenings and prenatal care and … let insurance companies go back to dropping people’s coverage when they get sick.”

Democratic Rep. and Michigan Senate candidate Gary Peters has not accused Land outright of participating in a 'War on Women,' but his campaign has argued that she would restrict women's access to health measures

A Service Employees International Union (SEIU) ad released Monday charges that Land and 'billionaire special interests' are out to 'gang up' on Michigan families.

'Insurance companies could go back to charging women more,' the ad alleges. 'It would be harder for women to get equal pay. And Land would even cut access to preventative care like mammograms.'

Land's new 30 second ad doesn't provide any reasons as to why she would be better suited to represent Michigan women in the Senate other than the fact that she is a woman.

'Congressman Gary Peters and his buddies want you to believe I'm waging a war on women. Really? Think about that for a moment,' Land asks as game show style music begins playing in the background.

She then takes a sip of coffee, shakes her head disapprovingly and looks at her watch before saying, 'I''m Terry Lynn Land, and I approve this message because as a woman, I might know a little bit more about women than Gary Peters.'

'The purpose of this ad is to set the stage for the rest of the campaign and show the absurdity of the Democrats’ strategy to leverage the war on women against Terri,' Land's campaign strategist John Yob told reporters in an email.

'Terri Lynn Land has an impeccable record advocating for working women — developing management programs that resulted in more women managers statewide and implementing flexible time for working moms. She also has the vision to get both women and men back to work.'

Not so, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman Regan Page fired back in a statement posted on the organization's website. 'Terri Lynn Land is on the wrong side of pay equity and health care issues important to Michigan women and her 30-second gimmick to distract from her record and poke fun at women’s issues shows just how out of touch she really is.'

'Michigan women deserve a leader in Washington that will fight for pay equity, and women’s health care and it’s clear Terri Lynn Land will do neither.'

Democrats relentlessly went after Republicans in 2012 for 'being on the wrong side of women's issues.' Even President Barack Obama claimed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was offering women a 'sketchy deal.'

'Democrats were successful in their war-on-women messaging last election because we didn’t fight back, Republican National Committee press secretary Kirsten Kukowski told Politico earlier this month. 'We need to turn the table, tell voters the Democrats are being deceptive and bring our viewpoints to the table, which is exactly what we’re doing.'

'It would be harder for women to get equal pay' if Terri Lynn Land were elected, an SEIU ad released Monday argues
