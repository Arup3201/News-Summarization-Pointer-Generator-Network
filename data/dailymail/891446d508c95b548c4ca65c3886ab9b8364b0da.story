Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka is wary of a Liverpool backlash – in much the same way his former side Real Madrid returned to form at the weekend.

The Teessiders travel to Anfield for Tuesday’s Capital One Cup third-round tie with the Reds having lost two on the bounce in the Premier League.

Boro, meanwhile, thrashed Brentford 4-0 on Saturday to make it three wins on the spin.

But Karanka points to Real’s 8-2 win at Deportivo on Saturday as an example of how quality sides can hit back – they, too, had lost their two in La Liga.

‘I know they aren’t in a good way but they have a good manager and good players,’ said Karanka.

‘We must go there to win, you can’t go to enjoy the atmosphere. That is dangerous.

‘Look at Real Madrid, they were very bad two weeks ago then they score eight goals.

Despite thier poor performance against West Ham Karanka fears a backlash from Liverpool on Tuesday

Middlesbrough beat Brentford 4-0 on the weekend but Karanka knows Liverpool are at a different level 

‘You cannot know what is, and what is not, a good time to play Liverpool.

‘You have to remember, they are a Champions League team and we are a Championship team.

‘There is a big difference between Liverpool and us. Our real tests are against teams in the Championship.

‘But we will go there and try to win.’

Real Madrid responded to a difficult start to the season by putting eight goals past Deportivo on Saturday

Aitor Karanka says his team will try and win when they go to Anfield but knows they will be up against it
