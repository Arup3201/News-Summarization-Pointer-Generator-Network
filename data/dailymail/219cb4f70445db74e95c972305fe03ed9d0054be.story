Hangovers are worst at the age of 29 as we don't have the same stamina as when we were younger but still try to party hard, a new study reveals.

The average hangover lasts nine hours 45 minutes and reaches its peak at 9.45am, according to research by Redemption.

The study for the alcohol-free bar movement in London claims that two-thirds of Britons go to work hungover on Monday and take an average of six sick days every year due to hangovers.

Hangovers are worst at the age of 29 and last for an average of 10 hours and 24 minutes as we don't have the same stamina as when we were younger but still try to party hard, research suggests

Its research suggests 29-year-olds mistakenly think they can hit the town as they did when they were younger but end up with hangovers that last an average of 10 hours and 24 minutes.

The study surveyed 2,000 Britons over the age of 18 across the country, over half of whom were between the ages of 25 and 44.

The research found that the prospect of work on a Monday morning does not stop people indulging on a weekend drinking session.

A staggering two thirds of Britons go into work hungover at the start of the week, while half admit they have gone in still being drunk.

On average, Britons have six sick days a year due to hangovers, as they don't have the energy to work after a night out.

The research also claims there is a north-south divide when it comes to coping with hangovers.

Those from Glasgow are the strongest and people living there experience relatively short-lived hangovers of six hours, while Bristolians suffer the most, experiencing hangovers that last on average 10 hours.

People have been searching for the best hangover cure for centuries, but Redemption's study found that a third of Britons believe having sex is the best solution.

The study of 2,000 people nationwide also found 10 per cent of people have woken up in A&E following a heavy drinking session, while half confessed to being sick on a big night out

The research also looked at whether 
people regretted their drunken antics and found one in in 10 have posted
 messages or images that they regret on Facebook.

A third of people admitted to regularly removing drunk photos of themselves from the social network.

Perhaps
 more worryingly than over-sharing, more than half of Britons have been 
sick during a drinking session, with one in ten have woken up in 
A&E.

One in five have 'sexted' someone they shouldn't have while drunk and another five per cent have said they have slept with their boss.

Ten per cent of people confessed to getting naked in public and a further 6 per cent to wetting themselves, having binged on alcohol.

Chris Murray, a shop assistant from Portsmouth, admits feeling hungover on Monday morning when he turns up to work.

The 29-year-old said: 'If I go out over the weekend I'm definitely still feeling the affects of the night out when Monday morning comes around.

'When I'm out on a Saturday night, I don't start to feel better until 7pm or 8pm on Sunday evening.

'And even on Monday morning I still feel a bit rough. If I went out on the Sunday night I wouldn't be able to work the next day - I'd have to phone in sick.'

The research was conducted by Redemption, an alcohol-free bar movement with the aim of finding out how far alcohol is ingrained in British culture.

Catherine Salway, founder of the temptation-free bar, said: 'People have asked me if I am mad to be 
starting an alcohol free bar movement and this research shows just how 
radical the idea is - alcohol is totally ingrained in British culture.

'With Redemption we are aiming to 
challenge that convention, poke fun at our national pastime of 
overindulgence, and offer people an alternative: having fun without 
alcohol - a night off rather than a night in.'

The pop-up bar, which serves exotic alcohol-free cocktails and healthy raw food instead of conventional bar snacks, launched in Netil House in Bethnal Green, East London this summer and will open permanently in September.
