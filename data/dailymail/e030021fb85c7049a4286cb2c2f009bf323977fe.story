The days of discovering your smartphone is about to run out of battery at the most inconvenient times may be over thanks to a wallet that doubles up as a phone charger. 

The Mighty Power Wallet resembles a typical leather wallet, but it conceals a battery and micro USB port that can be used to charge devices such as tablets, smartphones and e-readers.

It also has all the usual pockets and slots for notes and cards, as well as a separate sealed area for coins.

Made from Italian Saffiano leather, the wallet is a regular size so it can be easily stashed in a pocket.

When it is opened out, the wallet is approximately 4 inches (11cm) wide, 3.5 inches (9cm) long and an inch (2.5cm) thick.

It comes fitted with a built-in 3000mAh battery, which has around one-and-a-half times the amount of energy needed to charge a smartphone.

The time it takes to charge a phone varies depending on the model and its age, but an iPhone 6, for example, would take approximately two to two-and-a-half hours to charge it from dead to 100 per cent.

It costs £74.99 ($119) from Firebox.com.

A spokesman for the company said: ‘The battery is 3000mAh and is placed inside the wallet - it is well concealed and doesn't take up much room.

‘It charges your phone on the go  and you shouldn't need to buy a new battery.’

There is also a larger ‘Mighty Purse’ for women, which comes in different coloured leathers, such as black, gold, pink and purple and contains a slim battery and USB cable to charge devices while they are still in the clutch bag.

The female purse costs £89.99 ($142) and claims to be the ‘ultimate fusion of fashion and technology.

An alternative charger, which is the size of a credit card, is the Onaji Pawa Card. 

It uses three connectors and can charge Apple’s iPhone 4 and 5 series, along with any smartphone that uses a Micro USB. 

Its makers claim it adds 30 per cent of charge to a device. 

Versatile: The battery is thin and can itself be recharged using a USB cable and a regular smartphone charger to store power for another day. Different cables that plug into the micro USB port can be used to charge different gadgets (pictured charging an iPhone)
