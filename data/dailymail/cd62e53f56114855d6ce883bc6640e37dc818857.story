The grieving polyamorous mother of murdered 6-year-old Alanna Gallagher is now fearful for her own life after finding the family car and a small memorial to her slain daughter intentionally set aflame early Friday morning.

Laura Gallagher was listed as a parent on Alanna’s obituary following the discovery of her tarp-covered dead body in a Saginaw, Texas intersection July 1, as were two other men. She spoke publicly Friday for the first time since Alanna’s death.

Now, just three weeks into her grief, Gallagher and her unique family—none of whom, police say, are prime suspects in the chilling case—must deal with the fear they are being targeted.

Shocked: Laura Gallagher spoke to the press for the first time Monday after arsonists torched her car and a memorial to her murdered 6-year-old daughter

Missed: Neighbors said the often saw 6-year-old Alanna riding her scooter down her street in the quiet neighborhood before her July 1 murder

Around 2:15am Friday morning, the family was startled to hear a pounding on the door.

‘Fortunately, a neighbor had come over to wake us,’ Gallagher told KXAS. ‘We'd been asleep upstairs.’

As they slept, a family car was torched along with a small memorial that had been set up in honor of Alanna.

As news cameras rolled Friday, charred remnants of the car could still be seen in the driveway.

Unthinkable: Gallagher, who is in a polyamorous relationship with two other men who identify as the late Alanna's parents, stands over charred remnants of her car

Sad: A small memorial placed nearby in Alanna's honor was also torched early Friday

Down the street, a memorial of stuffed animals and other children’s toys was also set on fire.

‘It's very frightening,’ said Gallagher.

Police are struggling with the issue, as well.

‘It's kind of hard to say what people's intent was in this situation,’ Saginaw police spokesman Officer Damon Ing said. ‘[It's] just very disheartening that someone would do this to the family.’

Coping: Neighbors quickly set up a makeshift memorial on the curb for the little girl. It was torched along with the family's car Friday

Positive outcome? Police released footage from the day of Alanna's murder soon after the arson Friday, hoping someone will recognize these two black cars

As for Gallagher, she said she just wants the person caught.

‘I don't want this to happen to any other family,’ she said.

As unthinkable as this arson appears, Gallagher hopes some clue was left behind that could ultimately lead to the capture of Alanna’s killer.

Police hauled the burnt car away Friday to investigate the arson further.

Investigators probing her death seized more than 100 items from the family's home, but said none of the three parents are prime suspects. However, Saginaw Police Chief Roger Macon added that no one has been eliminated as a suspect, The Star-Telegram reported.

Officers took items from the home as well as from three vehicles parked outside.

A search warrant shows they were 
looking for red duct tape, packaging, Walmart plastic bags, trash bags, 
men's belts sized 38-44 and any material that could be used to bind.

Macon added that officers were not judging the parents' polyamorous relationship.

Family: Alanna is seen with her defense contractor father Karl, her mother Laura and her two older siblings

'The
Gallagher/McDaniel family considers Miles as a parent, and we are being
considerate of their lifestyle; it's not our place to offer judgment on
them,' Macon said.

'As with
any criminal investigation, each of the people closest to the victim is
being considered, and their actions investigated.'

Police say the Gallaghers and McDaniel were all home while Alanna played outside alone on the evening of July 1.

Loss:
Neighbors said Alanna, pictured with her older siblings, always seemed 
far smarter than other children her age and always seemed to ask mature 
questions

Her body was found about 7.30pm. Her father did not report her missing for another two hours after that.

At
a news conference, police spokesman Ing said investigators are tracking
down several leads and have already received numerous tips about the 
disappearance of little Alanna - but they need the public's help to find
her killer.

Shortly after 
news of the arson was made public, police released surveillance footage 
of two black cars, taken in the neighborhood around the time of Alanna’s
death.

Searching: Police executed a search warrant on the girl's parents' home following her murder. The house is located about a mile and a half from where the body was found

Murder: The FBI has joined the investigation after the horrifying discovery. No children from the area have been reported missing, so the case starts with few leads

Alanna's father Karl Gallagher made a brief statement to reporters on July 3, asking for people to come forward with information about his daughter's murder
