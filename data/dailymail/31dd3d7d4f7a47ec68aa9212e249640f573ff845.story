A junior football league which stopped publishing scorelines from one-sided matches to spare losing players' blushes has agreed to resume the proper reporting of results.

The Telford Junior Football League had come under fire for listing all home wins as 1-0 and away victories as 0-1 to ensure the welfare of youngsters aged between 9 and 16 following heavy defeats.

The league claimed to be keeping to Football Association guidelines in withholding the true scores from its matches, but the ruling body has no rules requiring results to be changed.

Victory: The Telford Junior Leagues has said it will now publish the correct scores on its website having initially insisted all results be recorded as either 1-0, 1-1 or 0-0 to avoid embarrassing young players

In a statement confirming that the 
Telford league has now agreed to report actual scorelines, the 
Shropshire Football Association said: 'The Telford Junior/Youth Football
League, in response to the FA National Youth Review, have piloted a 
different system of recording results.

'In hindsight, this was a decision 
that should have been taken in consultation with the member clubs of the
league and the county Football Association.

'Following a meeting between the 
league management committee and Shropshire FA vice-chairman David 
Simpson, it has been recommended to the league by the Shropshire FA that
in the interim, before a meeting of the league management and member 
clubs to discuss future policy of reporting results, the correct scores 
be reported.'

A spokesman for The FA commented: 
'There's an FA rule that prohibits the publishing of results and league 
tables across all media for U7 and U8 age groups where the focus of the 
game is about learning to play without the pressure of full-time scores.

'Across all age groups, there are no rules, sanctions or FA guidelines which indicate that the final score should be changed.'

The league, which was founded in 
1984 and has more than 2,000 players from clubs in Telford, north 
Shropshire and Bridgnorth, had said it would will also stop recording results for under-11
teams altogether from next season.

'Still 1-0... despite 7 goals': The Telford League had stopped recording thrashings, no matter how many goals young players scored

The move drew criticism from parents, who said it made the league table a pointless exercise.

One parent, who did not want to be 
named, said: ‘This is because they don’t want kids embarrassed if their 
team has lost

‘If that’s the case what’s the point of having a league table up on the website at all?’

Another parent, who also did not want
to be named for fear of turning officials against his son’s team, said:
‘I think it’s crazy - kids need to learn about winning and losing from 
an early age. They aren’t recognising the boys’ achievements.

‘They might not want to embarrass the
losing team but if one of the lads scores six or seven goals and that 
isn’t recorded what kind of message does that send to them?

‘The lads might as well not turn up.’

Assistant secretary Stephen Groome said the league had introduced the results policy on its official website this year.

But not everyone was against the moves and Stephen Clarke, manager of the under-11s Wrekin Panthers team, backed the move.

He said: ‘The children’s welfare is 
paramount. The winners have three points on the website if they win and 
the children who lose 20-0 would feel very disheartened if it was on the
website.

‘They might think of not playing. I think it’s a very good idea.’

But Mr Clarke added there must come a point when players had to accept defeat.

He said: ‘I think probably by the age
of 15 then they have an understanding that life is a bit of a 
competition and we are competing with other people.’

Dame Kelly Holmes, the double Olympic champion, has spoken out in the past about the decline of competitive sports for children.

She said it risked spawning a 
generation of bad losers and blamed a culture of political correctness 
for making ‘competitiveness’ a dirty word.
