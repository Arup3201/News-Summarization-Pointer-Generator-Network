A decomposed body found in a West London park on Saturday is that of Arnis Zalkalns - the prime suspect in the Alice Gross murder investigation, Scotland Yard said today.

A post-mortem examination of the body found in Boston Manor Park has been held and it has been formally identified as 41-year-old Zalkalns of Ealing, west London. 

The grim discovery in a part of the park used for shelter by Eastern Europeans for years ended the Europe-wide manhunt for the convicted murderer, who is the only suspect in the death of 14-year-old Alice.  

Scotland Yard said the cause of death is consistent with hanging and there is no evidence of any third party involvement.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said today that the search for the missing teenager has been one of the most 'complex in recent times'. Adding that it was carried out over 25 square kilometres of canals rivers and land.

He said: 'These searches expanded south and west from Trumpers Way for a further eight square kilometres, including Boston Manor Park and Osterley Park.

'These initial visual searches of open land highlighted inaccessible areas that required further search with specialist equipment, trained officers, police divers or search dogs. 

'A number of the areas identified for further search were within Boston Manor Park.

'The densely overgrown area where Arnis Zalkalns was discovered was one of these areas. This area had not been searched by police previously. 

He added: 'The recovery required a substantial removal of forestry to enable access for forensic teams. The body was eventually removed shortly after 10am on Sunday.' 

On Saturday the suspect's body was cut down as dozens of specialist officers scoured the park for clues

Meanwhile detectives are keen to speak to a mystery teenager who was spotted with Zalkalns just hours after the schoolgirl went missing on August 28. 

The boy, believed to be about 14 or 15, was said to have been with the prime suspect in an off licence in Ealing, west London, the day she disappeared.

Shopkeeper Fereydoon Alavi, who is in his 50s, said the unknown teenager went into the Corner Shop and tried to buy alcohol before being accompanied by Zalkalns.

He said: 'He was here with a teenage boy - I think it was August 28, in the afternoon/evening time. 

'The boy tried to buy cider but he didn't have ID so I didn't serve him.  He then went outside and asked the man to come in for him.

'He seemed out of it, he was very jumpy, like he was on drugs.  He was unshaven, scruffy, and smelt - it was just suspicious.

'The boy came in first. He asked to buy cider but I refused him when he had no ID.

'Then the other man came in, he bought the cider. He seemed out of it. He was unshaven, scruffy and smelly. The whole thing was suspicious.'

Mr Alavi, who also said the man appeared suspiciously 'hyper', said the boy had the 'beginnings of a beard', was of Asian appearance and 'looked like he had been sleeping outside'.

The shopkeeper said he was visited by police in mid-September, and confirmed to them that he had seen Zalkalns, before giving them his CCTV of the man's visit to his shop in The Avenue, Ealing. 

The corpse was found in parkland which is a popular haunt for Eastern European immigrant rough sleepers. Above, forensics officers arrive at a tent erected at the scene in Boston Manor Park where the body was found

It comes as police continue to face a barrage of searching questions over their handling of the ill-fated inquiry in which the victim's body was only found after weeks of searching.

As residents expressed disbelief that the huge police operation failed to find the missing Latvian more quickly:

On Saturday the suspect's body was cut down as dozens of specialist officers scoured the park for clues.

The investigation is far from over despite the death of the only suspect.

Detectives face months of painstaking forensic work to piece together Arnis Zalkalns' final days.

The investigation will run parallel to the one examining the body of Alice Gross and the materials used to hide her corpse.

Police will compile their evidence and pass it to the Crown Prosecution Service. Senior lawyers will consider the case, and are then likely to announce whether it would have been strong enough to mount a prosecution.

In the short term, tests will ascertain how Alice died.

But it could be many months before a full public inquest can draw a line under the crime.

Police said the corpse was 'badly decomposed', raising the prospect that it has been there since he went missing a week after Alice vanished.

There was a 'substantial' amount of forestry which had to be removed to allow forensic teams to get to the scene, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said. 

It was found in parkland which is a popular haunt for Eastern European immigrant rough sleepers. Zalkalns' family said he used his military training to live rough for weeks when he moved to London in 2007. 

Those who knew the Latvian think he may have stayed in the park, and it remained one of his favourite places.

His former landlord Radoslav Andric, 64, said: 'He was a loner, he used to ride his bike around the park a lot. This park was like his escape from society. I believe that the last time I saw him he was on his way to the park.'

The park runs alongside the Grand Union Canal, a mile from where Alice was last captured on CCTV. Locals described an isolated part where immigrants erect shelters as a 'no go' area.

Linda Massey, from Friends of Boston Manor Park, said police searched the area a week ago. She added: 'We have rough sleepers in the park but the police did check all the tents. They're mainly Eastern Europeans.' 

Police cordoned off the area on Saturday following the discovery of the body of a man in Boston Manor Park

On September 28 uniformed officers were seen searching the same area. It is not known how long the body has been in the woods though it was said to be 'badly decomposed'

Local cafe owner Alex Khan said: 'He wasn't right, he was a very big weirdo. He would sometimes come in, order a coffee and say he liked to see the pretty little girls. 

'It would always be between the hours that schools kicked out then he'd walk up to the park where they would all hang out.'

It is thought that no suicide note was found, but detectives have CCTV of Zalkalns withdrawing money the day before he vanished. He sent some of it to his former mother-in-law in Latvia.

On the weekend, Zalkalns' girlfriend, Katerina Laiblova, 39, complained that police took nine days to investigate after she reported him missing. And last night, Zalkalns' sister said police had not yet contacted her family to say they had found his body.

MP Mr Pound, who has been supporting Alice's family at their Hanwell home, said: 'Police now have some serious questions to answer. However my first thoughts are with Alice Gross's family.'
