Sufficient: When children are left to decide their portions they learn to recognise when they are full (file picture)

Passing bowls of food around the table at family-style meals can help beat child obesity by teaching youngsters about portion control, new research suggests.

For when children and child-care providers sit around a table together at mealtime, children learn to recognise when they are full in comparison to when food is pre-plated for them, the latest study shows.

The findings came from a study of feeding practices of two to five-year-old children in 118 child-care centres in the US.

It report's author, Brent McBride, the director of the University of Illinois Child Development Laboratory, said: 'Family-style meals give kids a chance to learn about things like portion size and food preferences. When foods are pre-plated, children never develop the ability to read their body’s hunger cues.

'They don’t learn to say, okay, this is an appropriate portion size for me.

Rsearcher Dipti A. Dev said: 'Instead of asking Are you done? teachers should ask children, Are you full? Or they should say, If you’re hungry, you can have some more, explained Dev, who is developing a packet of best feeding practices to share with providers.

'Asking the right questions can help children listen to their hunger and satiety signals,' she said.

The Illinois research is the first study to evaluate whether child-care providers are adhering to the academy’s guidelines for feeding practices.

Most providers did promote healthy feeding by serving nutritious foods and not pressuring children to eat or restricting them from eating. Head Start programs stood out though as having the best policies and feeding practices.

In fact, Head Start teachers who use family-style meals are strong advocates for them, the researchers said.

'Teachers who don’t do family-style meals have all these reasons that they don’t: there’s too much waste, it’s messy, young kids don’t have the developmental skills-the fine motor control-to do that,” McBride said.

'But Head Start teachers were telling us ways you could help develop those fine motor skills: for instance, using scoops in the sandbox or pouring water in the water table,' he added.

'When you first do easel painting with a two-year-old, it’s really messy because they don’t have fine motor control, but you still do it even though it’s messy.

'The same thing is true for family-style meal service. It may be messy at first until they develop the appropriate skills and learn to pour the right way or hold the cup as they’re pouring. It’s a developmental progression,'he said.

'If children don’t want to eat, teachers shouldn’t urge them to eat anyway out of concern that the kids may get hungry before the next meal or snack is served.

'If a child doesn’t eat at one meal, he’ll compensate for it over a 24-hour period. Making kids eat when they’re not hungry is probably the worst thing you can do. It teaches them not to pay attention to their body’s signals,' Dev said.
