Apple has made the launch date of 
iPhone official - at last. But the company hasn't said what new models, 
if any, it will be launching, instead inviting journalists to a 'Special
Event', with the cryptic invitation 'Let's Talk iPhone'.

The company remained typically tight-lipped about what the 'event' might launch - but it seems set to be epic.

For
the first time, the event is being held at the company's Cupertino HQ in California -
at the famous address, 1, Infinite Loop, a geeky programming joke. Few 
outsiders ever visit the complex - so even seeing the company on its 
home turf is sure to ignite a media frenzy.

Let's talk iPhone: The Apple invitation, with the date, the time and the location

Every previous event has been held at conference venues nearby.

Apple
staff have been 'banned' from holidays in the first two weeks of 
October in America, and tech insiders expect products from the launch to
appear in stores shortly after - probably on October 14.

All the signs now point towards an early October launch for the gadgets.

Tim Cook, chief operating officer of Apple Inc, is expected to launch the iPhone 5 on October 4. The event will be his first big product introduction

'Having
seen first-hand how Apple packs its staff inside its stores for iPhone 
launches does suggest that whatever new product they announce  is 
imminent,' says Luke Peters, editor of T3.

Tech insiders believe that any new iPad is far off in the distance, and that the current flurry of components, rumours and leaks refer inevitably to new models of iPhone.

The idea that there are two models - one sporting the fast A5 processor inside iPad 2, and a cheaper model with lower-tech components, seems likely.

Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to 'the new iPhones released next month.'

This seemed to confirm two rumours: one, that there would be more than one model, and two, that they would both appear late in October. Mr Gore's statements - at a conference in South Africa - also tied in closely with the most credible of the recent iPhone rumours.

While the iPhone 5 is much anticipated, there is more at stake than usual.

This is because, since legendary 
outgoing CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs announced his departure, it will be newly installed CEO Tim Cook’s first big product 
introduction, and the place where the public will experience a new iPhone without Jobs's cultish presentation.

People 
have wondered whether Apple can continue to compete without its creative
driving force - especially as rivals such as Samsung continue to gain 
ground on the tech giant.

Apple's new iPhone is now competing with hi-tech touchscreens such as Samsung's Galaxy S II - and the battle has also become the subject of a bitter legal dispute
