A new commuter rail concourse is being built 16 stories below Grand Central Station as part of a $15billion development.

An army of workers is blasting through bedrock to create the shiny new area that will have more floor space than New Orlean's Superdrome.

It is one of three hidden projects going on beneath the streets of New York City to expand what is already the nation's biggest mass transit system.

The most dramatic project will result in a
sort of 21st century, underground Grand Central Terminal mirroring the 
century-old Grand Central Terminal above -a 350,000-square-foot, $8.3 
billion commuter rail concourse with six miles of new tunnels.

Even with blasting and machinery grinding through the rock day and night, most New Yorkers are unaware of the construction below ground that includes a massive, eight-story cavern, miles of tunnels and watery, gravel-filled pits.Â 

Engineer Michael Horodniceanu, president of capital construction for the state Metropolitan Transportation Authority said: 'I look at it and I'm in wonder, I'm in awe.

'I feel like when I went to Rome and entered St. Peter's Basilica for the first time. I looked at it and said, "Wow, how did they do that?"'

In New York, they hauled out so much rocky debris from under Grand Central that it could have covered Central Park almost a foot deep, Horodniceanu says.

Together, the three projects will cost an estimated $15 billion.

And when they're all completed, estimated for 2019, they will bring subway and commuter rail service to vast, underserved stretches of the city, particularly the far East and West sides of Manhattan.

'They'll be a game-changer for New Yorkers,' says Horodniceanu.

It will accommodate Long Island Rail Road trains that now bypass Manhattan's East Side as they roll east through Queens and straight to Pennsylvania Station on the island's West Side.

This so-called East Side Access will bring about 160,000 passengers a day from Long Island to a new station in Queens' Sunnyside neighborhood, then about five more miles to the new, eight-track Grand Central hub.

It is currently a construction site about five football pitches long.

The Federal Transit Administration is kicking in $2.7 billion toward the estimated $8.3 billion budget, with the MTA state agency covering the rest using mostly taxpayer money.

Crews have carved out tunnels and were preparing to lay down concrete on the construction of the Second Avenue Subway

Also under construction is the Second Avenue Subway that eventually will serve Manhattan's far East Side, from Harlem to the island's southern tip.

The planned eight miles of track will open Manhattan's East Side to millions of people who now squeeze daily onto the Nos. 4, 5 and 6 subway trains running under Lexington Avenue.

Dubbed the 'The Line That Time Forgot,' the Second Avenue Subway has been a New York City dream since the 1920s.

Then came the Great Depression and World War II, followed by lack of funds that stopped the project after several stretches of tunnel with tracks were built in the 1970s. The existing tunnels are now being incorporated into the new ones.

The first phase - 1.7 miles with stations between East 63rd and East 96th streets - is to be completed in 2016 at a cost of $4.5 billion. Funding and plans for the rest of the route are still up in the air.

Finally, there's the extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to a huge new real estate development on Manhattan's Far West Side, New York's biggest besides the World Trade Center.

It's called Hudson Yards, a small urban village of high-rises, parkland, retail businesses and cultural institutions in the West 30s.

Moody's Investors Service calls this subway extension - financed through $2.1billion worth of city-issued bonds - 'a key milestone towards attracting development.'

'These are vital projects, and they'll reinforce the infrastructure of the city,' says Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University.

'It's not just about people going to work; the New York subway and rail systems are busy 24 hours a day, taking people shopping, to theaters, to clubs.'

The city's 468 subway stations register more than 1.6billion rides a year.

The system is used by more than 5 million daily riders. The Metro in Washington, D.C., has about 800,000, and San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit has about 400,000.

The three mammoth projects require creative solutions and the latest technology.

When crews prepared to drill the giant new cavity under Second Avenue, they first had to freeze the ground to about minus 20 degrees so as not to destabilize the buildings above as the boring machine cut through.

For that, aluminum tubes were inserted from the street and a special chemical solution was poured into the ground and cooled by a refrigeration plant.

The Second Avenue tunnels hold a space-age surprise: The ceilings are coated with a material once used to fireproof the space shuttle.

The new line has another major improvement. Instead of ventilation grates that allow rainwater to pour in, the new stations will be aired using enclosed cooling plants.

When Superstorm Sandy hit the city last October, floodwaters washing over the East Side did not penetrate subway construction sites.

'We're using the best technology available today, but this is really people-intensive work,' says Horodniceanu, who supervises a team of thousands of workers on any given day.

'I feel I have the most exciting job in the world,' he says. 'It's an incredible feeling to be able to build a legacy project. I hope that one day, my grandchildren will be able to say their granddad built this.'
