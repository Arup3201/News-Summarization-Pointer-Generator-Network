Usain Bolt was a late withdrawal, but in his absence his young pretender, Kemar Bailey-Cole, sprinted to an easy victory against a world class field in Zurich on Thursday night.

Bailey-Cole is the double gold medallist from the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow who trains with Bolt under Glen Mills, and he was Bolt-esque as he unfolded his tall body and then eased up to cross the line in 9.96, the only man under 10 seconds.

Britain’s European 100m champion James Desaolu was third in 10.06 while the 200m champion, Adam Gemili, was fifth in 10.13. It was a better night for Britain’s women’s sprinters who won the 4x100m relay ahead of a strong Jamaican quartet.

Long limbed: Kemar Bailey-Cole was only man to run below 10 seconds in a strong field 

Asha Philip, Anyika Onuora, Ashleigh Nelson and Desiree Henry won in 42.21, a new national record and three-hundredths faster than the time that three of them – with Onuora coming in for Jodie Williams – ran on their way to European gold in the same Letzigrund stadium eleven days earlier.

‘It’s amazing,’ said Nelson. ‘We just wanted to run well again. The crowd was amazing, the girls are amazing.’

Henry, who ran the anchor leg, said; ‘I just looked to my left and right and thought, oh my God, these are the quickest girls in the world, but you know what, I consider myself one of them and I knew that these girls would do a fantastic job to put me in a good position. I’m so glad that we were able to get the baton around smoothly.’

Desaolu was merely content with his performance in the men’s 100m, running from lane one. ‘I felt pretty good, and I’ve still got a few races left so hopefully I’ll be able to improve. I’m 100 percent fit,’ said the injury-prone Desaolu.

Gemili, who confirmed afterwards that this would be his final race of 2014, said: ‘I didn’t realise until I took my first stride, it was hard. Coming off the back of two championships I had done a lot of work. But to finish fifth ahead of Nesta Carter, who’s run under 10 seconds this year, is good.’

Earlier, Martyn Rooney, the European 400 metres champion, faced LaShawn Merritt and could only manage 45.10 for fourth, with Merritt winning in 44.36.

‘That was poor,’ said Rooney. ‘I’m really disappointed with that. You need to challenge but if you give LaShawn Merrit five metres it’s very hard to chase him down. I’ve had two championships, one better than the other, but these opportunities don’t come everyday.’
