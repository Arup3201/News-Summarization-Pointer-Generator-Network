Marines are up in arms over President Obama's proposal to create unisex hats that some have branded too 'girly' for males - while others have lambasted its steep cost as unnecessary.

One estimate is that the divisive new hats, which are thinner and smaller than those in the current uniforms, could cost as much as $8 million.

'What's wrong with the current uniform?' one Marine posted on a story about the proposed hats. 'NOTHING! Read the news... Marines getting relieved, 
budgets and structure being cut, and we have time/desire to evaluate a 
new cover [hat]. You gotta to be kidding!'

New design: Proposed new hats for the Marines are smaller and thinner - and will cost $8 million

The hats, which have been designed to 
be used in male and female uniforms, are called the 'Dan Daly' hat after
 a Long Island sergeant who earned the Medal of Honor twice.

He famously led his tired, outnumbered Marines at Belleau Wood in June 1918 during World War I, yelling: 'Come on, you sons of b****es, do you want to live forever!'

But some Marines are complaining about the switch from the old hats, which have been part of the uniform since 1922, while others have complained about its look.

'The Dan Daly cap looks too French, and the last people we want to associate our Marines with would be the French military,' one wrote on the Marine Corps. Times website.

Old design: The current hats are much wider - but the Marines wants uniforms to be unisex

Another quipped: 'Why not just put them all in pink camo?'

Name sake: The hats are named after 'Dan Daly' a WW1 sergeant who earned the Medal of Honor

One senior Marine source added to the New York Post: 'We don't even have enough funding to buy
 bullets, and the DoD is pushing to spend $8 million on covers that look
 like women's hats!

'The 
Marines deserve better. It makes them look ridiculous.'

So far the hats are just a proposed design, and a second part of the proposal suggests women simply wearing the current male hats with slight modifications - instead of the Dan Daly hat.

Marine Corps head Gen. James Amos will make the final decision, and officials have until the end of this week to allow or reject the proposed design.

The move to make female uniforms more like those worn by men comes as the DoD starts to open more combat unit roles to women.

An
 informal survey of the Marine uniform advisory board already found: 
'The group members did not like the appearance of the Dan Daly cap on 
the male Marine.'

But the Marine Times reported how, over 
the years, the Uniform Board has made recommendations against the 
opinions expressed by the Marines in surveys.

One example was the 
decision to wear uniform sleeves rolled down, even in the summer.
