The ground-floor property, in Chelsea, west London, has three bedrooms, a front terrace and a communal courtyard.

It was bought in 1989 and is part of a post-war estate  made up of 30 council and privately-owned properties, near King's Road.

In July, Lawrence Poxton, 48, and his wife Teresa, 46, moved into a terraced property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after the council put 33 properties on the market for £1 in a desperate attempt to clean up the area.

They were picked from thousands of applicants and were the first couple to take advantage of the scheme.

It was bought in 1989 and is part of a post-war estate made up of 30 council and privately-owned properties

In October 2013 Southwark Council, in south-east London, auctioned off Britain’s most expensive council house - a four-story Grade II listed building - for £2.96million, to help pay for new homes.

Built in 1820, the property was first used by bosses at Anchor Brewery before being taken over by Courage, an advert for which is still printed on its wall. 

The 200-year-old building, which is near Borough Market in London was bought by an anonymous bidder from Southwark Council, which said it would invest in at least 20 new social houses.

Opposition: When the property went on auction, squatters who had been living in the house hung signs on the side of the building in protest
