Trainer Olly Stevens has hatched an ambitious plan which could see two-year-old filly Peace And War running at the Breeders’ Cup in California next month.

The daughter of sire War Front won on her Lingfield debut before finishing sixth to subsequent Group One winner Cursory Glance in the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot. She landed in Keeneland yesterday.

Peace And War will run in the Group One Alcibiades Stakes on dirt on October 3 or the Group Three Jessamine Stakes on turf five days later. A win in either guarantees a starting berth at the Breeders’ Cup.

It's not cut and dried that Peace And War (right) will run in California next month 

Surrey-based Stevens said: ‘I will fly out and work her on the dirt next weekend. It is an ambitious plan but a case of taking her where conditions will suit when the ground is only going to be getting softer here.’

Peace And War, who cost $300,000, is owned by a partnership which includes Stevens’ main backer Sheik Fahad Al Thani and Mohammed Al Kubasi, whose first horse in training was Stevens-trained Lightning Thunder, runner-up in the English and Irish 1,000 Guineas.
