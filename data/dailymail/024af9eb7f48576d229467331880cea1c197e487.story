Anthony Noto, who joined the company as CFO in July, appeared to be expressing his desire to buy another company in the message

Twitter's own chief financial officer showed that anyone can slip up when it comes to social media, when he made the classic mistake of posting a public tweet that was meant to be private direct message.

Anthony Noto, who joined the company as CFO in July, appeared to be expressing his desire to buy another company in the message, which was presumably intended for a fellow Twitter executive.

It read: 'I still think we should buy them. He is on your schedule for Dec 15 or 16 - we will need to sell him. I have a plan.'

Mr Noto deleted the message soon after it was posted, but not before a number of his 9,300 followers took screengrabs and shared the failed tweet - prompting speculation as to which company the CFO could possibly have been talking about.

NBC pointed out that the last tweet favorited by Mr Noto was from Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, who reportedly turned down a $3 billion cash offer from Facebook in 2013. 

The news site also felt it worth noting that a number of the accounts recently followed by Noto feature employees from a news startup aimed at young people called Mic.

It is not unusual for Twitter to acquire smaller firms that create features for the site.

Technology news site  Re/code suggested a number of possible purchase targets for Twitter including the selfie app Shots and anonymous social app Secret. 

It also pointed to Drawbridge - a startup that helps brands monitor consumers and target them with advertising - as a potential target for Mr Noto, while Storehouse, Prismatic and Shopular also featured on their list.

Mr Noto was previously a technology banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc and created an account for the social media site in 2009. Twitter has not commented on his post.

A journalist retweets Noto's failed direct message, which suggests he wants to acquire another company. The original message was taken down soon after it was posted - but not before a number of Noto's 9,300 followers took screengrabs and shared the failed tweet
