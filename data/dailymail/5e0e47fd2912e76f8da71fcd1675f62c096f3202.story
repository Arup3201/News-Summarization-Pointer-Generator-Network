A newborn who was a day from death after her body was starved of oxygen, was saved thanks to her mother's instincts.

Kelly Crow took her three-week-old daughter Kaci in to hospital after she failed to put on weight and had a blueish tinge to her hands and feet.

After a battery of tests she was diagnosed with an extremely rare heart defect and rushed to surgery in the nick of time.

'She constantly had blue hands and feet. I knew that something definitely wasn't right,' Ms Crow said.

Kaci was born last summer, weighing 5lbs 15ozs and her mother said she thought something was wrong straight away.

However, doctors discharged them with the promise they would keep an eye on Kaci's progress.

Back at home in Millbrook, Hampshire, Ms Crow became more concerned.

'She just wouldn't feed, so I was really worried that it was something serious,' the mother-of-four said.

She took Kaci back to hospital when she was three weeks old - a decision she is eternally grateful that she made.

Kaci underwent a battery of tests including blood tests, X-Rays and an eco-cardiogram. Within hours she was diagnosed with Total Anomalous Pulmonary Veins Drainage, a life-threatening condition that has only affected six children in the UK in the last decade.

It is a rare but deadly congenital 
defect in which veins in the heart are in the wrong place, affecting how
oxygen rich blood is pumped around the body.

'Instead of blood going to her lungs, 
liver and kidney, it was just bypassing her lungs and she was just being
starved of oxygen,' her mother said.

Surgeons at the world-renowned 
children's heart unit in Southampton Hospital, cut one of the 
chambers of Kaci's heart to correct the flow. The procedure was a success and she was allowed home after nine days.

However, afterwards surgeons revealed it had been a very close call.

'I'd taken Kaci in at teatime on August 
17, and the surgeons said she would have died within 24 hours if she 
hadn't gone under the knife,' Ms Crow said.

'Thankfully I did and by a miracle she's still here today. The surgeons saved my baby's life and I owe them a lot.

'Without them I may never have seen her take her first steps or develop into the absolutely brilliant character she is today.'

Now 18-months old, Kaci is a delight for her mother, father John Phillips, 33, and three older siblings.

Ms Crow is planning a 15,000ft skydive to raise £2,000 pounds for the unit that cared for her baby.

It came under threat from government funding cuts last year but was saved from the axe by a 250,000 strong petition.

Miss Crow added: 'Because Kaci's surgery was a repair operation no further action is needed.

'Kaci will be observed just like any other little girl as she grows, but she's been given a clean bill of health to live a full, happy, healthy life.

'I don't like heights and never thought I'd jump out of a plane but if my daughter could be brave at such a young age, then I can be brave too.'For more information visit justgiving.com/kellykellie
