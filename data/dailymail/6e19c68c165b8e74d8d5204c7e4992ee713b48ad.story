The seven-year-old survivor of a horror plane crash that killed her family tried to wake up her dead parents before struggling on to safety, it has emerged.

The horrific crash killed the parents, sister and cousin of Sailor Gutzler, who was left alone in a forest after dark with a broken wrist and almost a mile away from any help.

But before she struggled through the thick brush, the child tried to wake up her dead relatives, thinking they might be asleep.

Sailor tried to rouse the family members to no avail. She told Larry Wilkins, whose door she ended up at after her desperate walk to safety, but they 'wouldn't wake up', according to ABC News.

Wreckage: The plane, headed from Florida to Illinois, crashed over Kentucky Friday night

A Kentucky State police spokesman also said: 'She indicated to us that she believed her family was deceased but that she hoped they were just sleeping.'

It came as remaining relatives set up a fund to provide for the girl.

A family spokesman said: 'The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sierra Wilder.

'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.'

He said the fund, 'for the benefit of Sailor Gutzler'. is active at sailorgutzlerfund.com. 

The seven-year-old girl who survived a plane crash that killed everyone else on board used a stick lit with fire to find her way through 0.75 miles of thorny woodland to find help. 

Sailor Gutzler dragged herself out of the private twin-engine plane on Friday evening with broken bones to see her mother, father, sister and cousin were dead.

Bloodied and traumatized, she used the burning wreckage to fashion a makeshift torch to guide her way through the Kentucky forest until she saw a light on in a house. She reportedly employed survival skills her dad taught her to stay alive.

The dramatic details of Sailor's night come from 71-year-old Larry Wilkins: the man who opened his door at 6.30pm (7.30pm ET) to find the little girl shaken on his porch.

Trauma: The family had all been in Florida for the holidays to visit Sailor's adult brother in the military

'I opened the door and this little girl was standing there with bloody nose, bloody legs and bloody arms,' Mr Wilkins told NBC.

'Her voice was quivering. She told me her mom and dad were dead and she was in a plane crash and the plane was upside down.

'She was bleeding pretty bad, her legs were bleeding, her face had a bloody nose. 

'She was barefoot, only had one sock on.

'She asked if she could stay here,' Wilkins recalled.

He immediately called 911 and then went to work cleaning up the bloodied girl with a washcloth.

When police arrived, the little girl was so shaken up she could hardly make herself understood.

'I felt so sorry for her, tears come my eyes,' said Wilkins who described the little girl's journey as 'very, very rough territory.'

The plane had taken off from Key West in Florida, where Sailor was visiting her adult brother Nick Brink with father, Marty Gutzler, 49, mother Kimberly Gutzler, 45, her nine-year-old daughter, Piper, and her cousin 14-year-old Sierra Wilder.

They were heading home to Mount Vernon, Illinois, when the plane reported engine troubles. 

The crash killed everyone on board except for Sailor. 

Lieutenant Brent White of Kentucky State Police said the situation was extraordinary.

'She literally fell out of the sky into a dark hole and didn't have anybody but her own will to live and get help for her family,' White told the Associated Press. 'Absolutely amazing.'

He told NBC: 'She's upside down in an aircraft that's crash-landed, she is in shorts and a t-shirt, she's seven years old, she has broken bones, she pulls herself out of the aircraft, she's in a place where she doesn't see any lights, she walks through thorns, briers, a 12-foot ditch, and continues to walk in that environment with no shoes on until she sees a light on in a house.'

The family who died in a plane crash in Kentucky were traveling home from visiting their son at a naval base in Florida when their plane went down near KY 810 South in Lyon County.  

Family friend Troy Dunbar, who worked at Mr Gutzler's furniture store in Nashville, IL, told Heartland News, Mrs Gutlzer's adult son, Nick Brink, is in the military stationed in Key West and the family were coming back from visiting for the holidays. 

A spokesman for the family, Kent Plotner, issued a statement Saturday afternoon that read: 'The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sienna Wilder. 

'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.'  

Sgt. Dean Patterson of the Kentucky State Police says the FAA received a distress call at 5.55pm from a private plane in the area around the time the girl reported the crash to a resident.

The resident called 911 at 6.30pm and the seven-year-old was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries - she has now been released. 

According to local reports, the aircraft was flying from Key West, Florida, to Mt Vernon, Illinois, at the time of the accident.

The FAA Memphis Center confirmed that there was a distress call from a private plane in the area of the crash. 

The last contact was at 1,800 feet.

Kathleen Bergen of the FAA says air traffic controllers lost contact with a Piper PA-34-200T as it was flying over Marshall County in the southwestern part of the state.

The pilot had reported engine problems. 

'I've got an 8-year-old child myself, that just turned 8-years-old. And when I saw this [what] appeared to be a 7-year-old child that walked through this dense Forrest,' Lieutenant Brent White with the Kentucky State Police told KFVS.

'Through some really tough terrain. Awful poor weather conditions – and survive this, it's just really a miracle.'

Kentucky State Police Lt. White said emergency crews ' worked tirelessly to find this wreckage and hopefully salvage the lives of those that were on board. But, ultimately, it just wasn't meant to be.' 

Mr Dunbar said Mr Gutzler had been flying since he was 16 and was a very experienced pilot.

A longtime friend of the Gutzlers, Patrick Povolish, 61, told the St Louis Post Dispatch: 'This is a small community where everybody knows everybody and this will be devastating for the whole town.

Daily Mail can now reveal that the plane was registered to Dr Alan Froehling, a neuromusucular orthopedic from Mt Vernon, Illinois. 

According to Keith Todd with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, the aircraft landed deep in a heavily wooded, remote area off of Buckberry Trail.
