The parents of an 18-month-old boy with an aggressive brain tumour have accused the Federal Government of refusing to fund his much needed treatment because of Budget cuts.

Edwin Ho and wife Rochelle Luk will fly their son Edric to the U.S. on Sunday for targeted proton beam therapy costing $200,000 and have been forced to remortgage their home in Brentwood, Perth so that they can afford it.

'I can't help questioning if our Government sacrificed an 18-month-old boy because of Budget cuts,' Ms Luk told the West Australian.

Struggle: Edric needed treatment for an aggressive brain tumour and doctors say his best chance of survival is with special treatment in the US

Struggle: Edric has already had a tumour half the size of his brain removed in an operation

A Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital radiation oncologist and Edric's parents claim the therapy is the toddler's best chance of survival, but the government says he should have the more standard treatment that is already available in Australia.

The family says pleas for funding from the Federal Health Department's Medical Treatment Overseas Program have been rejected.

And that they have been forced to borrow from friends and family to get their son treated at the University of Florida.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told MailOnline that the decision not to fund the overseas treatment came from a 'preliminary assessment which at this stage denies the treatment'.

'One of the main criteria for treatment overseas is that it can't be performed in Australia. Patients with the same condition are currently being treated in Australia,' she said.

'If doctors or the family can come back with further information before a final decision is made then it will be considered.'

However, the family claim the conformal photon radiotherapy treatment being offered to them in Australia has 'horrible side effects'.   

Little Edric, who has already had a tumour half the size of his brain removed in an operation, has also been recommended for the special treatment abroad by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.

He is suffering from an anaplastic ependymoma - a tumour that forms when cells in the central nervous system (in his case the brain) begin to multiple rapidly.

'It was devastating': Edric's mother Rochelle said finding out her son was sick was 'every parent's worst nightmare'

Appeal: The hospitals who have been treating Edric in Australia have disagreed with the Federal Government's decision

Undecided: A Health Department spokeswoman said a final decision had not been made about funding the toddler's treatment

The experts said the best treatment for Edric was unavailable in Australia and other treatments delivered much bigger areas of low dose radiation to brain tissue that could be harmful.

Describing the moment they found out Edric was seriously ill, his father Edwin told Seven News: 'He was normal one week and paralysed the next.'

At 18-months, he stopped walking and lost the use of his right hand.

'It was devastating. It was the worst nightmare of a parent,' his mother Rochelle said.

The hospitals who have been treating Edric in Australia so far - the Sir Charles Gairdner and Princess Margaret hospitals - said they would appeal against the decision not to fund his overseas treatment.
