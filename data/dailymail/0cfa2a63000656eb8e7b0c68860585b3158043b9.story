Shahab Reza, of Perivale, London, has admitted his role in the swindle and is facing years behind bars

A deaf couple and his family falsely claimed £900,000 meant for sign language interpreters to fund a luxury lifestyle and diamond jewellery, a court heard today.

Shahab Reza, of Perivale, west London, submitted fake invoices to the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) but used the money to fund holidays, jewellery and university fees, prosecutors say.

The 51-year-old and his wife, Shehnaz Reza, 53, both of whom are deaf, also involved their children, Zainab Reza, 22, and Abbas Reza, 26, it is claimed.

Father Shahab has admitted his role in the swindle and is facing years behind bars.

Mother Shehnaz and children Zainab and Abbas all deny being part of a conspiracy. 

Southward Crown Court heard Shahab Reza and his wife Shehnaz Reza oversaw a massive four-year benefit swindle on the Department of Work and Pensions using false invoices for sign language interpreters.

They recruited their son Abbas Reza, now a 26 year-old doctor, and daughter Zainab Reza, now 22, to help with the scam, jurors were told.

The family splurged the proceeds on a luxury home, a £600,000 penthouse, gold jewellery and an £8,000 ‘flawless’ diamond, it is said.

Mastermind Shahab Reza has admitted his role in the con.

But his wife and children, who claim they were ‘doing what they were told’, are now on trial for assisting him by signing off documents, jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard.

Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC told jurors the children had been ‘drawn into the fraud very early’.

She said: ‘There was an interesting agreement found in the search of the family home. This was a contract signed by both siblings, an employment contract between brother and sister in 2008 when Zainab would have been 16 and Abbas would have been 20.

‘The agreement was to employ her for £400 a month - that is just a sham agreement.

‘Shahab Reza knew he could trust his children to sign those documents and they would not ask any questions.

‘We say that the young people - Abbas Reza and Zainab Reza - are intellectually able.

‘Certainly we know that Abbas Reza is a fully trained and qualified doctor. Zainab Reza has a degree as well and they are no fools. 

'However young they were when they first signed the documents, they grew in age and  were not stupid.’

Both children and their mother were accomplished in signing off expense claims through one of the family’s six sham companies, the court heard.

Ms Cottage said: ‘What was being claimed as a business expense was, for example, a home burglar alarm, Mrs Reza’s travel expenses of £300 in April 2009 and her mobile phone bill. She didn’t seem to be doing very much work for the company, though.'

Meanwhile Zainab Reza was claiming her travel expenses and Abbas Reza was claiming insurance for his mobile phone, jurors heard.

Ms Cottage said: ‘I say that they were put through by Abbas, Shehnaz and Zainab Reza because it wasn’t just Shahab Reza getting hold of the family receipts and doing it himself.

‘They were brought into the fraud at every possible opportunity and signed off documents at requested.’

Zainab Reza and her mother claimed for travel and ‘everything they ate’ on a trip to Dubai to purchase an investment property, it is claimed. 

And qualified doctor Abbas Reza is said to have splashed cash on a trip to America in July 2009 and claimed back spending money and travel in expenses. 

Southward Crown Court heard Shahab Reza, 51, and his wife Shehnaz Reza, 53, oversaw a massive four-year benefit swindle on the Department of Work and Pensions using false invoices for sign language interpreters

Prosecutors said that when the alleged fraudsters were arrested there was thousands of pounds worth of gold jewellery and gems in a safe at their house, as well as a £8,000 diamond.

The court heard Shahab also lied about his family's financial circumstances to Harrow Council, netting nearly £100,000 in benefits and tax exemptions between June 2002 and August 2010.

The Reza family is also accused of conning the NHS and the Student Loans Company, with Abbas allegedly receiving a fraudulent bursary.

Ms Cottage told the court: 'The ease with which these frauds were perpetrated is scandalous. The extend of the Reza family's greed and ability to lie is breathtakingly arrogant.'

Abbas, Shehnaz, and Zainab Reza, from Stanmore, each deny conspiracy to defraud.

Shehnaz Reza further denies a single count each of fraud by false representation, obtaining money transfer by deception, and dishonestly obtaining exemption from liability.

Zainab denies a further count of fraud by false representation, while Abbas denies two counts of fraud by false representation.

Four deaf friends of the family - Saifur Rahman, 31, Ahsan Naseer, 29, Natela Babina, 30, and Daiva Alisauskaite, 42 - are also on trial, accused of being part of a swindle.

Naseer, of Birmingham, Babina, of Wembley, north west London, Alisauskaite, of Hackney, east London, and Rahman, of Camden, north London, all deny conspiracy to defraud the Department of Work and Pensions.

The trial at Southwark Crown Court in London, which is expected to last two months, continues.
