A boy from Sierra Leone has been banned from attending a British primary school because ‘hysterical’ parents are worried about ebola, his mother said yesterday.

Kofi Mason-Sesay, nine, was due to spend several days at St Simon’s Catholic Primary School in Stockport, Greater Manchester, as part of an annual visit.

But despite being tested for ebola and given the all-clear on his arrival in Britain last week, parents mounted a campaign to have Kofi’s trip cancelled, saying they feared he could pass on the deadly virus to their children.

Public Health England have confirmed there is no risk in Kofi (right) or Mrs Mason-Sesay (left) attending the 168 pupil school, but parent power led to the initiative being cancelled by governors

Arrival: A British school has banned nine-year-old Kofi Mason-Sesay, pictured arriving at Heathrow Airport from from Sierra Leone last week, because parents feared the boy could give his classmates Ebola

School: Kofi, who has joint British and Sierra Leonean nationality, was due to spend several weeks at St Simon's Catholic Primary School in Stockport (pictured)

Kofi’s mother, Miriam Mason-Sesay, 48, who is English, branded the parents ‘ignorant’ after headmistress Elizabeth Inman bowed to the pressure and refused to allow the schoolboy, who has joint Sierra Leone and British citizenship, to attend classes.

Mrs Mason-Sesay, who moved to Sierra Leone from London to set up an education charity 14 years ago, said: ‘We are being treated like lepers and it’s very sad.

‘The school and its governors have been extremely supportive, but I’m afraid they’ve been put under undue pressure by an aggressive minority spreading panic and ignorance about this virus.

‘I am a reasonable citizen and mother – there is no way I would be wandering around with my nine-year-old if he had ebola. We have had one case in Britain, but just one, because we contain it.

Anger: Parents campaigned against Kofi or his British mother Miriam (right) going to the school, fearing they could pass on the disease which has killed at least 678 people in Sierra Leone

Plan: The pair flew into Heathrow last Tuesday, where Kofi is pictured, and it had been planned that Kofi would attend classes at St Simon's while he and his mother stayed with family friends in Greater Manchester

‘It is a difficult disease to catch but that point has not been taken on by these ignorant parents. We have absolutely no contact with sick people – we’re an education charity.’

Mrs Mason-Sesay set up EducAid, an organisation which aims to educate vulnerable children in Sierra Leone, with her brother in 2000. It teaches 3,000 youngsters across nine boarding schools, mostly in rural locations.

In 2003, she married a local tailor, Alhassan Sesay, and Kofi was born in London in 2005, but the family moved back to Sierra Leone four weeks later.

Mr Sesay died in 2009, aged just 35, of an infection which Mrs Mason-Sesay believes he would have survived if treated in the UK.

After his death, the charity worker decided she never wanted to travel without her son.

Education: Kofi was due to join St Simon's on a placement while Mrs Mason-Sesay carries out fundraising visits to other schools as part of her work with charity EducAid Sierra Leone

Missing out: Mrs Mason-Sesay said she and her son had been met with 'leper-type attitudes' from people 'over-reacting' since their arrival in the UK

Student:  Kofi has been going to classes at St Simon's  since he was three and he has friends there

Model pupil: Kofi with some of his certificates heralding his progress in maths

Mrs Mason-Sesay returns to Britain twice a year to give talks to schools about the charity’s work in Africa, so Kofi always accompanies her.

Once he reached school age, Kofi was offered an annual placement at St Simon’s during his mother’s visits and would attend classes for up to a month each year.

In a letter to parents, Mrs Inman said it was with a ‘heavy heart’ that she and the school governors had decided to cancel Kofi’s visit because of ‘misguided hysteria’ of some parents.

She wrote: ‘A significant number of parents have been in touch with me to express their fears. 

'There are many parents who believe that the visit should have gone ahead and that we are contributing to misunderstandings by cancelling it. 

Work: Mrs Mason-Sesay's charity has been trying to raise much needed funds to help children who have been orphaned by Ebola or other diseases

Reassuring: In a newsletter sent out last month, the school reassured parents with advice from Public Health England that symptomless people travelling from Africa, like Kofi, are not infectious

Visiting: Kofi attends the school when he visits the UK with his British mother to see family and friends

‘In this instance, it has been very hard to juggle justice to Miriam and the views of parents.

No risk: Last month the school tried to reassure parents via a newsletter that the visit posed no risk

‘It is with great sadness that we decided to cancel the visit; the misguided hysteria emerging is extremely disappointing, distracting us from our core purpose of educating your children and is not an environment that I would wish a visitor to experience.’

Parents yesterday defended their stance. Richard Chamberlain, 36, said he had considered removing his two sons from the school if Kofi joined their classes.

He added: ‘All the information we get in the media is that this disease has an incubation over 21 days, as far as we are concerned he could be ill by day 20 – who knows? 

'The risk is not worth taking. I absolutely would be worried if he was here.’

Serenity McCann, 40, said the school were right to cancel Kofi’s visit.

She added: ‘You can’t risk anything with children. Even if they tested negative, the next day they could be positive.

‘I would be worried if they had let him come here. It hasn’t been a major panic, just some parents emailing the head.’

But Peter Broom, whose two grandchildren are at the school, said: ‘I think the school were over-reacting but they have got to listen to parents. 

'If they are clear of the disease, I don’t see the problem.’

Pupil: Kofi last visited the school in July, and tends to take classes there two or three times a year

Safety: Mrs Mason-Sesay said many schools in Sierra Leone have been closed due to Ebola, and children there, like Kofi, know to avoid physical contact

'Heartbreaking': Mrs Mason-Sesay said there had been 'so much pressure from an ignorant parent body that the school had to act'

Family: Kofi pictured as a toddler with his mother Miriam, and father, tailor Alhassan Sesay - who died from an infection in 2009

Donation: Headteacher Elizabeth Inman suggested to parents that a sizeable donation should be made instead to EducAid to recognise its work in a country 'which has received more than its share of setbacks'

Concern: Richard Chamberlain, 36, who has two sons at school said he felt that the school had made the right choice, but that he felt sorry for Kofi

Mothers:  Heather Rafferty, 33, (left) said parents had threatened to remove their children from the school if Kofi had been allowed into lessons, while Serenity McCann, 40, (right) who has one daughter at school said the school had made the right choice, given the risk involved

'Overreaction': Peter Broom, whose two grandchildren go to the school, said staff had overreacted

Predictions: A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks

Aid and charity workers providing care under the UKAid programme will have their risk assessed when they return to the UK, and if they are well, will be placed into one of three monitoring groups. Mrs Mason-Sesay and Kofi need not need to be tested, but did so of their own volition.

Category 1 

A person who has visited an Ebola affected area, but had no direct contact with an Ebola case (or body fluids) while they were there. 

There are no restrictions on the activities of people in this category - they can return to their usual activities and there is no requirement for them to be monitored. Kofi and his mother fall into this category.

Category 2

A person who has had direct or close contact with Ebola cases (or body fluids) while they were in the affected area, but wore appropriate protective equipment or clothing and had no breaches of this. 

They can return to live at home with ordinary family and social contact, return to work with some restrictions (only certain types of clinical work if a healthcare worker), travel by public transport and carry out other daily activities. They are required to check their own temperature twice daily for 21 days after return, and to report any raised temperature of over 38°C or other relevant symptoms to a named health protection team at Public Health England (PHE).

Category 3

A person who had direct or close contact with Ebola cases (or body fluids) while they were in the affected area, wore appropriate protective equipment or clothing, but are concerned that they may have had a breach in these protective measures or have had direct contact with an Ebola patient’s blood, urine or secretions without being protected.

They can return to live in their own/ usual home with ordinary family and social contact, attend office-based work only (not patient care areas), and can take agreed UK transport (as discussed with their monitoring team at PHE). They are required to check their own temperature twice daily for 21 days after return, and to report daily to a named health protection team at PHE, even if they don’t have a raised temperature over 38°C or other suspicious symptoms.
