Former CIA director and army general David Petraeus is seemingly endorsing Hillary Clinton for president, according to a new book.

'Sheâ€™d make a tremendous President,' Petraeus reportedly says in the new book 'HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton,' written by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes.

'Like a lot of great leaders, her most impressive qualities were most visible during tough times,' he says in the book, according to The New York Daily News. 'In the wake of the Benghazi attacks, for example, she was extraordinarily resolute, determined, and controlled.'

Petraeus was CIA director during the Benghazi attacks, which killed four Americans, including two who worked for the CIA, as well as Chris Stevens, the U.S. ambassador to Libya, ABC News reports.

The book will be on sale Tuesday, and claims that Petraeus and Clinton became friends while she served as Secretary of State.

Clinton reportedly invited Petraeus to her house in December 2008 to talk about the Middle East over wine, according to The Wall Street Journal. The meeting is believed to been so successful, Petraeus returned for more wine the next night.

Clinton and Petraeus, the paper adds, soon became allies over foreign relations in the Middle East. Petraeus reportedly even lent Clinton his plane when hers broke down in Saudi Arabi.

Clinton and Petraeus reportedly also became close when discussing personal issues, the paper adds. After Petraeus resigned as CIA director in the wake of his extramarital affair with biographer Paula Broadwell, Clinton is believed to have sent him a note of sympathy referring to her own husband's reported infidelities, writing 'I have a little experience.'
