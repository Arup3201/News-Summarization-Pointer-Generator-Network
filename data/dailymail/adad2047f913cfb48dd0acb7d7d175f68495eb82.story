Frenchman Alexander Levy will head into the final round of the weather-hit Portugal Masters with a three-stroke lead after Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts could not make up any ground at the Oceanico Victoria in Vilamoura.

The tournament had already been reduced to 54 holes after heavy rain and thunderstorms had caused lengthy delays.

Levy had been one of only six players to be able to complete his second round on Friday, getting into the clubhouse with a 61 to sit 18-under.

Although Belgian Colsaerts - who had shot 60 on Thursday - still had two holes left to try to close the gap when play was able to resume, he could only return pars on the eighth and ninth to card a 67.

Colsaerts is second on 15 under, with Chile's Felipe Aguilar at 13 under.

Aguilar had sunk a birdie at the 18th and then again on the first, picking up two more stokes on the third and fourth.

However, following another suspension due to the threat of lightning, a bogie on the seventh saw him come home at 64.

Englishman Richard Bland is one of several players seven shots back, tied for fourth place on 11 under.

Colsaerts is hoping he can reel Levy in on the final day.

He said: 'As I showed yesterday and today (Friday and Saturday), if you get off rhythm a little bit and you don't fully take advantage of the course, others will make up ground. Sunday will unfold and we will see what happens.'
