A tow truck owner was arrested on Friday for illegally towing cars of people who participated in Gay Days pride events in Orange County, Florida.

Jason P. Combs, 44, is charged on 49 counts of grand theft of a motor vehicle and various charges after being accused of towing more than 100 cars from the Westwood Town Center parking lot across the street from the Doubletree, Hilton is Orlando where the Gay Days events took place.

Combs, who owns ASAP towing, didn't have an up-to-date contract to tow vehicles, said police.

Gay Days is an event that attracts thousands of people to central Florida and encourages gay and lesbian visitors to wear red and meet at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom on the first Saturday in June.

The event draws in lots of clientele for local businesses some of which say it's their highest revenue-generating event every year.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Combs' attorney, R. David de Armas, claims that Combs had a contract with the owner and only illegally parks vehicles were towed.

Combs' attorney has also said that his client has nothing against homosexuals or the Gay Days event

'The fact that the [criminal] complaint said something about Gay Days makes me wonder what's behind it,' de Armas said.

'If someone shoplifted during Gay Days would the complaint mention that it happened during Gay Days?'

'This was total predator towing. There's really no other word for it.'

Schmeltzer said that a tow truck would hide around the corner awaiting word from the spotters as to which car to tow just minutes after the car's owner went to attend the event.

The complaint states that ASAP Towing had a contract with Westwood that expired in May.

The complaint also said that the people whose cars were towed were forced to take a cab to the towing company, pay $165 to get their car back, and also pay a $40 gate fee which 'isn't permitted under Florida law.'

The complaint explains that ASAP Towing renewed their contract in mid-June after Gay Days implying that they knew they didn't have a valid contract during the event.

'This is further evidence that Jason Combs knew he had no contract in place and was not authorized to tow vehicles from Westwood Town Center,' the complaint said.

Police say that Combs further broke the law because they towed the cars 10-miles-away to their Belle Isle location.

'He's one of those [business owners] that wants to pick and choose what [laws] he's going to follow,' Schmeltzer said.

Victims say that they felt employees were rude to them and that they felt 'bullied' because of their sexuality.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that the president of the Gay Days event Chris Alexander-Manley believes that Combs should be 'prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,' if the allegations are true.

'Definitely it will take hearing more of the story,' he said before accusing Combs of a hate crime.
