Lawsuit: Amusement park Dollywood, of which country singer Dolly Parton is a co-owner, is being sued after a woman allegedly suffered severe injuries after going on one of the rides 

Dollywood is accused in the lawsuit of disregarding the weather outside leading to The Waltzing Swinger being dangerous and causing the wounds, TMZ reported.

Tedi Brown allegedly suffered both brain damage and broken bones from the incident - and she and her husband are seeking damages worth $475,000 from Dollywood, according to the website.

A description page for the ride on the theme park's website says 'Dollywood's Waltzing Swinger soars to new heights of adventure as you glide through the air, 25 feet above Country Fair.'

The page also includes a 'Special Attraction Information: Waltzing Swinger is subject to closures during inclement weather conditions, including lightening.'

Dollywood spokesman Pete Owens said in a statement to MailOnline 'Out of respect for the process and as a matter of practice, Dollywood does not comment on pending litigation. We look forward to this issue being resolved and anticipate commenting at that time.' 

Messages seeking comment from  Parton's publicist as well as park co-owner Herschend Family Entertainment were not immediately returned.
