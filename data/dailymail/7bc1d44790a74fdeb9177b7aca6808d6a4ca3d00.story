Slain beauty: Susan Lowe was found raped and murdered in her home at age 19, and 30 years later, police say they finally caught her killer

Police in Washington state finally solved a 32-year cold case involving a woman who was raped and murdered thanks to DNA testing that led them to the suspected killer.

Michael Allan Halgren, 56, a convicted sex offender with a history of violent crimes, was arrested this week and charged in the 1980 slaying of Susan Lowe.

Lowe, who was a 19-year-old beauty at the time of her death, was strangled with a pair of pantyhose inside her Bellevue apartment. 

'It's always rewarding to solve any case, but especially a cold case,' said detective Lieutenant Jim Hershey.

On April 23, 1980, at around 10pm, Susan Lowe was alone in her apartment near Bellevue College watching the Seattle Supersonics game on television when she was brutally attacked by an intruder.

The next morning, her roommate found the 19-year-old's naked body lying in her bed with pantyhose tightly wrapped around her neck, according to a police report.

Investigators said Lowe was covered up by her killer in an effort to make it look like she was sleep, reported Kirkland Patch.

A neighbor told police at the time that they heard someone loudly knocking on Lowe's door and then a noise 'like something hitting the wall,' followed later by the sound of a muffled scream.

However, no one came to check up on Lowe or called for help.

Police made no arrests in the rape and murder, and even a $1,000 did nothing to help investigators crack the case.

Long after the trail went cold, the Bellevue Police Department continued searching for Lowe's killer, but it was not until this past May when the investigation hit a crucial breakthrough.

Scientists from the Washington State Patrol Crime Lab linked Halgren's DNA to the biological evidence found inside Lowe's apartment in 1980.

The 56-year-old was civilly committed to the McNeil Island Special Commitment Center (SCC) for violent sexual offenders after he was convicted of kidnapping a prostitute in 1995 and raping another Bellevue woman in 1989, the Seattle Times reported.

Although Halgren had lived only three blocks away from Lowe's apartment in 1980, when he was 23 years old, his name was never associated with the murder until last year, when SCC officials collected DNA from all the patients.

Halgren has a long history of sexual crimes. According to records, doctors at SCC learned that he had been a Peeping Tom in his teens, exposed himself to nearly 40 women in his 20s and raped more than 20 women, most of them prostitutes, after being discharged from the military in 1975.

Halgren also revealed that he sexually assaulted a relative after his high school graduation and raped three more women between 1974 and 1980.

When interviewed in August by police, Halgren denied ever visiting the apartment complex where Lowe lived and claimed he only had sex with his fiancée at the time of her murder, but added that he would have been interested in meeting Lowe becasue she was very pretty, according to charging documents.

When presented with the DNA evidence linking him to the crime, Halgren revised his story, telling a detective that he ad a one-night stand with the 19-year-old, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.   

On Wednesday, Halgren was charged with first-degree murder and transferred to King County Jail to wait for his arraignment on January 23. If convicted, he could face a life in prison without parole.
