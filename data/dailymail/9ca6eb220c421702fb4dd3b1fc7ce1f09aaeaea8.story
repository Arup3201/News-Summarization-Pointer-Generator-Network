This is the dramatic moment McDonald's fraudster Kevin Pomeroy and his nephew Daniel tried to speed away from police in a high-speed chase.

Pomeroy, who with his wife Julie conned high street businesses out of millions of pounds, reached speeds of more 
than 100mph driving on the hard shoulder of the M60 motorway.

Trying to evade capture, he threw incriminating items including a 
mobile phone out of the window of his moving car during the eight-minute pursuit.

Pomeroy, 47, stole the identities of executives from McDonald’s and Greggs to order hoards of goods through ‘company accounts’.

Over two-and-a-half years he ordered 
items worth £20million in one of the biggest frauds of its kind, taking 
delivery of £3million of goods.

These included 2,500 laptops, 3,000 
TVs, £400,000 worth of whisky, 20,000 bottles of champagne, 1,600 fake 
Christmas trees and 600 coffee machines.

The firms included Samsung, Argos, Sanyo, Fujitsu, Sony, M&S, Electrolux, Dyson, Staples, HMV, Jessops and John Lewis.

The goods were delivered to empty warehouses across Manchester and then sold on eBay or the black market.

Manchester Crown Court heard the Pomeroys set up email addresses in names of genuine employees from the two food companies.

They ordered goods from other firms saying they wanted them on the ‘company account’.

But they came unstuck when companies demanded payment for the goods they had ordered.

Yesterday, Pomeroy, his wife and his nephew Daniel Pomeroy were hauled before a court for fraud.

Kevin Pomeroy was sentenced to 
eight-and-a-half years in prison, Daniel Pomeroy to three-and-a-half 
years, which includes 18 months for a separate fraud offence, and Julie 
Pomeroy to 12 months, suspended for two years.

She was also ordered to do 150 hours unpaid work.

A fourth member of the gang, James Chapman, 22, was jailed for three years after admitting conspiracy.

The court heard the couple lived in a £350,000 detached four-bedroom house in Failsworth, Oldham.
Pomeroy drove a £65,000 Range Rover Sport while his wife had an Audi A3 convertible.

They rented a £2,000-a-month apartment in Marbella, Spain and one of their children attended a £10,000-a-year private school.

On the walls of their home were signed copies of photographs of Pomeroy’s favourite footballers.

Pomeroy paid for £10,000 dental veneers using proceeds from the fraud

He even spent £10,000 on a set of 
dental veneers.

One retailer, Celltec, which sells electronic items, 
went into liquidation as a direct result of the scam and 40 staff lost 
their jobs.

Daniel Pomeroy fled to Ireland but was arrested while visiting his mother.

Simon Rowlinson, of the Crown 
Prosecution Service, said: ‘Purchase orders were placed for items 
required for fictitious events including laptops for internet café style
restaurants and over 55,000 bottles of whisky and champagne worth over 
half a million pounds for various corporate events.’

Detective Chief Inspector David 
Pester said: ‘The gang would order 400 TVs at a time, but the companies 
would only discover the fraud when the first 100 were delivered and an 
invoice was sent to McDonald’s who said they hadn’t ordered them.

‘The majority of stuff has never been traced.’
