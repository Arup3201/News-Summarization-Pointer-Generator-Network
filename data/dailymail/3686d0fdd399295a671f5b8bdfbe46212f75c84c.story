Actresses and co-workers from Glee arrived for a memorial service for Julia Roberts' half-sister Nancy Motes yesterday, but the award-winning star and her mother were nowhere in sight.

No close family members of Miss Motes, who died from an apparent drug overdose last month, were spotted arriving at the memorial in Santa Monica. However Glee star Jane Lynch was spotted arriving for the ceremony.

The Glee production assistant had accused her famous sibling, Roberts, and mother Betty Lou Motes, of driving her to despair.

The death revealed a family rift in which Motes is said to have resented the fame and success of Roberts, who left their Georgia home for Hollywood when Motes was 9.

'Nancy was proud of Julia but she had severe abandonment issues,' Motes' fiance, John Dilbeck, said.

'She had a knee operation as a teen and piled on weight because she couldn’t exercise. While her sister was the Pretty Woman, Nancy was an overweight, insecure teenager.’

'Nancy was a tortured soul. She grew up in the shadow of a superstar as a sister and Julia’s fame  cast a cloud over her life,' he added.

‘Nancy adored Julia but she became 
increasingly resentful of the way Julia behaved towards her. In Nancy’s 
mind Julia was a bully.'

While
 Roberts and her mother were not seen arriving at the afternoon service 
at St Anne's Catholic Church, the actress Jane Lynch and members 
of Glee were pictured at the memorial.

Motes had worked for the special projects department of the show, in a job Roberts is believed to have helped her get.

The actress also paid for her younger sister to take holidays, and funded trips to Los Angeles so she could audition for acting roles.

Roberts released a statement on behalf of her family after Motes died, saying they were ‘shocked and devastated’.

It is not clear if Roberts and other members of the family attended the Santa Monica memorial.

Motes had regularly visited her sister in Hollywood, but when she was unsuccessful in launching an acting career she started to experiment with drugs, including marijuana, cocaine and prescription pills.

‘She dreamed of following Julia to Hollywood but was always wracked with self-doubt,’ Dilbeck said. ‘She was diagnosed with depression and was in therapy most of her life.

‘She went to Hollywood in her twenties but it didn’t work out. She used drugs to try to fill the hole inside her.'
