The Tories are to rebrand themselves as the ‘Workers’ Party’ and revive Sir John Major’s mission to make Britain a ‘classless society’.

The party’s chairman Grant Shapps, appearing alongside the former prime minister, will today insist that the Tories are ‘not here to defend privilege but to spread it’.

Mr Shapps will argue that the Government has a ‘bigger and more positive story to tell’ than one of austerity and bringing the public finances back towards sanity, seeking to reclaim the blue-collar conservatism that delivered Commons majorities to Sir John and Baroness Thatcher.

Mr Shapps will declare: ‘The Conservatives are the Workers’ Party and we are on your side.'

In remarks that risk drawing comparisons with David Cameron’s upper middle class upbringing, the Tory chairman will say that Sir John’s journey from the backstreets of Brixton to Downing Street ‘is a symbol of our party’.

‘Sir John Major campaigned for what he called a “classless society”, and I would argue this is the society we are fighting for in Government today: a Britain where it doesn’t matter who your parents are, where you can go as far as your talents and hard work will take you, and where work – rather than benefits – is what pays,’ Mr Shapps will add.

The Tory chairman will also unveil a five-point ‘pledge card’ – an echo of one deployed by Tony Blair in 1997 – setting out the Tories’ ‘long-term economic plan’ that will be at the heart of its 2015 election campaign.

It includes reducing the deficit; cutting income tax and freezing fuel duty; creating more jobs by backing small business; capping welfare and reducing immigration; and delivering the best schools and skills for young people.

There has been growing anxiety among Tory MPs about the collapse in support for the party in Scotland, much of the north of England and among ethnic minorities.

Though Mr Cameron still easily outpolls his party and Labour leader Ed Miliband, vanishingly few voters regard him as ‘in touch’ with the concerns of ordinary voters.

Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow Cabinet 
Office minister, said: 'You can't pose as the "workers' party" when 
you've made working people £1,600 worse off while cutting taxes for the 
wealthiest.

'Asking
 John Major for help is just a reminder that he was the last Tory leader
 to win an election - and that Tory MPs don't believe they can win under
 David Cameron. With David Cameron's record as leader they'd be better 
off renaming themselves the millionaires' party.'

Sir John grew up in a small house in Coldhabour Lane in Brixton in the 1950s, in contrast to the privileged upbringing of many in the Tory leadership

Blue collar Conservatives have 
insisted the party needs to reclaim its traditional mantle as the party 
for the hardworking lower middle class – calling for hikes in the 
minimum wage and further increases in the income tax allowance.

It has already been increased to £10,000, saving 24 million basic rate taxpayers more than £700 a year.

One
 prominent MP, Robert Halfon, is even suggesting the Conservative party 
should formally rename itself the ‘Workers’ Party’ and replace its green
 oak tree logo with a ladder, to symbolise its commitment to promoting 
social mobility.

‘To win 
back support, radical change is needed in the very nature of the 
Conservative Party,’ he said. ‘Let’s value public sector workers — 
nurses, doctors, police and teachers — millions of whom put service 
above self.

‘Let’s support 
working people by strengthening the minimum wage and fight for a living 
wage — achieved through further tax cuts for lower earners,’ Mr Halfon 
said.

Mr Shapps, making the first major 
speech to be delivered at the new Tory HQ in Westminster, will agree 
that the party needs to flesh out ‘our mission; what a Conservative 
majority would really mean for people’.

‘We
 are the party on the side of the whole nation. We are the party on the 
side of working people. Our politics isn't about a list of statistics 
and numbers. There is a moral purpose to it, a mission.

‘Imagine
 a young kid growing up in inner city London – just a few miles from 
here. His mum and dad are working, but not very rich, trying to pay the 
bills.

‘This young man was not particularly academic. He quit school at 16 and struggled to get on. So let me ask you something: what did the Conservative Party have to offer someone like that?

‘I’ll tell you. That young man’s name is John Major, and the Conservative Party made him Prime Minister… His life is a symbol of our party. It shows whose side we are on.’

Mr Shapps will insist the Government’s record to date demonstrates its core purpose, highlighting jobs figures showing that more than 30 million people are now in work and nine out of ten new jobs going to British people.

‘We are helping hardworking people to be more financially secure, meaning more people have the security of a pay packet and parents can plan better for their children’s future,’ he will add.

The Tory chairman will insist much more could be achieved with a majority Conservative government after 2015, including a ‘recovery in wages, a recovery in jobs, where you don’t just see the recovery in the stock market, but you feel it in your pay-packet as well’.

Mr Shapps will insist the ‘worst cliché in politics’ is that there is ‘no choice’ between the parties, saying it is now clear there is a ‘huge difference’.

‘We have to make that argument: Labour would go back to the same old policies that got us in this mess in the first place - more spending, more borrowing, more taxes.

‘This shows us something simple. If 
you are an apprentice, if you work, if you run a business; Labour's not 
on your side – but the Conservatives are.

‘If you drive a car, if you have a mortgage, if you pay Council Tax; Labour's not on your side – but the Conservatives are.

‘If
 you have children,  if you want rigorous standards in school, if you 
want your children to learn the skills of the future; Labour's not on 
your side – but the Conservatives are.’

He will also urge employers to take on more young apprentices and trainees, and unveil a new ‘John Major Apprenticeship Programme’ giving young people who have not been to university the chance to take a first step on the Westminster career ladder.

Yesterday Downing Street brushed off complaints from one unnamed Tory MP that Mr Cameron's inner-circle was still too elitist. ‘There are six people writing the manifesto and five of them went to Eton; the other went to St Paul’s,’ the MP said.

But Pauline Latham, the MP for Mid-Derbyshire, agreed that Mr Cameron tends to surround himself with ‘people who are like him’.

‘I am sure he listens to Samantha Cameron a lot but he is never going to listen to me. Everything is looked at through the prism of London, by people from London. We should have regional input’.
