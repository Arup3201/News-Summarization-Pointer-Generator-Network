A patriotic  couple insists the 'Australian flag stays' after being told to remove it from their front yard because of the 'current political climate'.

But body corporate Castle Real Estate in Darwin, Northern Territory has denied the order was because of the political climate and said the couple failed to apply for permission.

Homeowners Paul and Julie Lucas completed their renovations to their Stuart Park property by erecting the flag pole to a fence.

Paul Lucas appeared on Channel 9's program Sunrise on Monday. He said the flag will stay after body corporate ordered him to take down the Australia flag that is flying outside the block of units

They say the order is unjust and insist there are no laws against flying the Australian flag on a property, the NT news  reports. 

It’s not there to upset anyone, (but) why do we have to be like this in our own country? People come here because they like the way we live,' Mr Lucas said. 

Patriotism in the Lucas family goes back three generations - he, his father and his grandfather all served in the Australian Defence Force.

'We’re patriotic people, I’m proud of my forefathers and what people continue to do for us in this country,' he said. 

Both Mr and Mrs Lucas were shocked when body corporate told to remove the flag and said they thought it was a joke.  

Mr Lucas believes this demand is 'political correctness gone mad' and the flag was raised to embrace multiculturalism in Australia 

Mr Lucas insists raising the flag was a tribute to Australia's multiculturalism and is a way to welcome people of all kind. He said the demand is 'political correctness gone mad'.

'In this country at the moment everyone is scared to be Australian – if you look at America for instance they are so patriotic and proud of their country - why shouldn't Australians embrace it', Mr Lucas said on Monday's program Sunrise on Channel 7. 

Mr Lucas told Sunrise there were discussions offline that eluded to the belief the removal order was because of the current political climate.

He contends the body corporate called him the next morning the flag was raised and told him it is a 'politically sensitive thing'. 

According to Mr Lucas, the phone conversation went on to discuss planning and regulations but Mr Lucas insists he and his wife were told they could conduct any renovations because it 'was not attached to the building'.

'If someone mentions political before anything else well it's not the pole - it's political', he said. 

But Daniel Ferguson,  Managing Director at Castle Real Estate, said this order has nothing to do with Australia's political climate, instead insists the structure is in breach of body corporate.

Mr Ferguson said the Lucas' had to ask for permission for a flag to fly at the block of units. 

A statement from Castle Real Estate highlights the company's stance on safety and regulations.

‘Attaching the flag pole to the fence that forms part of the swimming pool barrier may contravene the swimming pool safety act 2014.

'Members of the body corporate are waiting to receive and discuss an application from Paul and Julie Lucas to erect a structure on the unit,' it reads.  

Mr Lucas is fighting against this demand and has decided the flag will stay flying.
