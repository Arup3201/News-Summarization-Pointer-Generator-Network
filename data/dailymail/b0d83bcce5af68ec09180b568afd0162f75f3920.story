How do you fancy renting out a real Dragon's Den for your holiday retreat?

Well now you can, after Scottish multi-millionaire Duncan Bannatyne put his Portugal home on the market.

Boutique real estate agency Ideal Homes Portugal has the ultimate in celebrity lifestyle offerings, with families able to book to stay in the newly acquired  home of the former Dragons' Den star.

Former star of Dragon's Den Duncan Bannatyne is offering his luxury Portuguese villa for rent, but it could cost as much as £5,000 a week

The balcony and swimming pool area are real sun traps in Banntyne's Portugal escape which is on the rental market

This room perhaps demonstrates some of Duncan's competitiveness, and even with a snooker table in there, there is enough room

The health club magnate bought his luxurious Algarve retreat, which comes complete with five bedrooms, swimming pool and charming garden area, in 2014. 

He and his family plan to use it for part of the year and rent it out for the rest, affording members of the public the rare opportunity to actually stay in a celebrity's home.

Holidaymakers can enjoy access to the excellent golfing facilities at Vale do Lobo, as well as several pristine beaches located nearby. Dining and entertainment options in the area are also first rate.

Prices start from £400 a night, and there is a minimum four-night stay. In high-season it will cost you £694 per night, which means costs could reach as high as £4,858 for a week in high season. The villa can cater for up to ten people. 

Villas in the area range from between €2million-€4 million (£1.5 million-£3 million) on sale price.

Chris White, Founding Director of Ideal Homes Portugal, who sold Duncan the property said: 'It was great to be able to work with Duncan to find the perfect Portuguese property for him and it's fantastic that holidaymakers in the Algarve have the opportunity to enjoy his villa as well. 

'It really is a superb property with plenty of room for families or groups of friends to spread out and relax.'

The rental offers a chance to stay in a celebrity hideaway at an affordable price, but best check for off-season prices first

Bannatyne, who announced in July last year that the current series of hit BBC show Dragon's Den would be his last, was one of the original cast for the programme. His departure means Peter Jones is the sole survivor from the first ever episode. 

Portugal is a popular destination with visitors from across the globe. With a reputed 300 days of sunshine annually, the country's southern Algarve region plays host to many happy holidays throughout the year. The cost of living is low, the beaches are sandy, the cuisine is delightful and good wine can be had for €2 (£1.50) per bottle.

This fabulous combination worked to make 2014 a particularly good year for tourism in the Algarve. The number of visitors in the first ten months of the year exceeded that for the whole of 2013, according to data from the National Statistics Institute (INE).

Agents worked with Duncan to find the perfect property for him and now you can enjoy his tastes and style for yourself

Desidério Silva, president of the RTA regional Algarve tourism board, said: 'In 2014 we have achieved the best numbers in recent years and the Algarve continues to be the driving force of tourism in Portugal.'

Food and wine were key attractions during 2014, as indeed they were in 2013, when they brought a record 14 million visitors to Portugal (up 4.2 per cent from the year before), according to Travel Pulse. 

The Dutch are also falling for Portugal's charms right now, with users of holiday review website Zoover voting the Iberian nation as their second favourite destination (after Austria). Russian holidaymakers too are pouring in, having moved away from previously popular destinations such as Goa, which are now viewed as far less welcoming to Russian tourists.

The villa can sleep up to 10 people, and has five bedrooms; this house is furnished to an exceptionally high standard with a modern yet eminently comfortable style

There's room for two in the jacuzzi bathtub, and you even get a since each to freshen up in the expansive bathroom

The villa is perfect for families or a a large group of friends to relax and enjoy some Portugal sun

Part of Portugal's charm is its ability to offer something for everyone. HolidayLettings.co.uk lists five bedroom villas in Vale do Lobo, for example, at prices ranging from £173 per night to £3,605, with the leisure activities on offer ranging from sittin on the sand with the waves lapping at your toes to spending the holidays as high rollers in the region's casinos.

With both the pound and the dollar looking good against the euro right now, Portugal's attractions as a holiday destination are even more tempting. As many families start planning their summer break, it looks like 2015 could be another bumper year for the Algarve.
