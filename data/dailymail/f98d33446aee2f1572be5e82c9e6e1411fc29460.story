Boris Johnson has applied to become the Conservative candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 General Election, his spokesman has confirmed.

The London Mayor submitted his name to Conservative Campaign Headquarters this morning - just 48 hours before the deadline.

Uxbridge is a safe Tory seat set to be vacated by Sir John Randall, the veteran Conservative MP, who held it last general election with an 11,000 majority.

The mayor of London Boris Johnson announced this morning that he had put his hat in the ring to take over from Sir John Randall in the West London seat

A committee of five members of the Uxbridge and South Ruislip Conservative Association will whittle down the number of candidates in the seat to three or four before putting it to a vote of the local Conservative association next month.

The final decision will be made on September 12 at a special meeting of the association.

Sir John Randall, has confirmed he will be stepping down ahead of the general election next year.

Mr Johnson made the announcement today after returning from holiday in Croatia last week.

The London Mayor announced his intention to return to parliament earlier this month, amid speculation that he is positioning to take over from David Cameron as Conservative leader in the future.

Mr Johnson said he hoped to ‘make his case’ that he was the best person to represent the constituency, held by Sir John Randall with a majority of 11,000 at the last general election.

‘I'm sure there will be plenty of excellent candidates and I hope very much to make my case to the association,’ he told the Evening Standard.

Pressure has been growing on Mr Johnson over several months to finally say whether or not he will mount a bid to return to the Commons. He quit as MP for Henley in 2008 after being elected Mayor of London.

But since Mr Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010 there has been mounting speculation that Mr Johnson would seek a route back to Westminster, after vowing to only serve two terms at City Hall.

After Mr Johnson announced his intention to return to Parliament the Prime Minister said the decision was 'great news'.

But Mr Johnson could also pose a threat to his old school friend if the Tories fail to win an overall majority next year.

Explaining his decision to return to Westminster Mr Johnson he said: 'I have danced around it for an awfully long time. The Prime Minster said ages ago that he would welcome me back.

'It is also been pretty clear I cannot endlessly go on dodging these questions as I have tried to do.

'Let me put it this way. I haven't got any seat lined up yet. But I do think that in all probability, since you cannot do these things furtively, in all probability I will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015.'

He suggested that it was not a foregone conclusion that he would win which ever seat he stands in, adding: 'It is highly likely that I shall be unsuccessful in that venture.

'You should never underestimate the possibility of things going badly wrong.

'But one thing that is absolutely clear, I will serve out my mandate as Mayor of London.'

UKIP's candidate in the seat, Jack Duffin, said Uxbridge and South Ruislip needed 'anything but Boris's ideas' - pointing to the London Mayor's bid to close Heathrow, build a high speed rail line between Manchester and London and grant amnesty to illegal immigrants.

He said: 'Boris has nothing in common with Uxbridge & South Ruislip and isn't interested in anything but his own career.'
