They say you should let the train take the strain. And that’s exactly what the Queen did today as she left London for her annual festive break at Sandringham. But being the monarch, however, she also let her Jaguar do the work too.

Much to the surprise of fellow passengers on the 10.44 from London’s Kings Cross to Kings Lynn, the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were driven all the way up Platform 1, right to the door of her First Class carriage.

Commuters were kept behind ticket barriers without explanation, and only realise their train was being graced by royalty when they saw their official car purr past.

Home sweet home! The Queen arrives at King's Lynn station accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh

Smart in a knee-length Prince of Wales check coat and a printed silk headscarf, the Queen appeared in good spirits as she marched briskly towards the waiting carriage.

The Duke of Edinburgh, meanwhile, was dapper in a neat navy blue blazer, complete with polished brass buttons, and carried a walnut leather briefcase.

The couple arrived at Kings Lynn on time at 12.21pm and smiled at well-wishers. The Queen’s staff normally book their tickets in advance using her senior railcard, which this year would have cost £34.30 each.

A
 source told the Mail: ‘The Queen encourages all her staff to buy 
tickets in advance as it works out so much cheaper and would always use a
 rail card if appropriate to do so.’

Surprise! Commuters were staggered to see the monarch being driven up the platform to board the train

On time: Perhaps wary of missing the train, the Royal couple then sped into one of the first class carriages

Christmas at Sandringham has become a
 royal tradition over the last century, with Queen Victoria becoming the
 first monarch to spend December 25th in residence.

All
 of the senior royals, including Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess 
of Cambridge, are expected to arrive at the private home within the next
 few days.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall are expected to arrive on Christmas Eve, just in time for tea and present opening at four.

The 20,000 acre estate will also play 
host to the newly-christened Prince George's first Christmas and will be
 the first time that four monarchs, present and future, have holidayed 
together since the Victorian period.

Prince George is expected to make his 
third public appearance during the Christmas period, when he and his 
parents join the rest of the Royal Family for the traditional Christmas 
Day service at the local parish church of St Mary Magdalene.

The Royals will also watch the Queen's Christmas message together, although traditionally,
 the monarch retires to another room to see it.

Festivities will be rounded off with a shoot on Boxing Day - another Royal tradition that dates back to the 19th century.
