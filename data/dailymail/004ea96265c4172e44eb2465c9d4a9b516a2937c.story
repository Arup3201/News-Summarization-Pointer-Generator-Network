A British backpacker was fatally poisoned after drinking gin which had been mixed with methanol.

Beautician Cheznye Emmons, 23, from Great Wakering, Essex, died after buying the alcohol while travelling in Indonesia with her boyfriend Joe Cook in April last year.

Her father says his daughter had not realised the danger she was in because the symptoms of methanol poisoning are similar to a hangover - so victims often attempt to just sleep it off.

Today an inquest in Chelmsford heard she had the drink, bought from a shop and with a seemingly legitimate label, with friends in Bukit Lawang, northern Sumatra.

She was rushed to hospital after experiencing sudden blindness and convulsions and died five days later.

High taxes on recognised brands of 
wine, beer and spirits in Indonesia have prompted shop owners to mix the
 drinks with a locally brewed substance called arak.

Some, like in Cheznye's tragic case, are using methanol, which is colourless, to try and keep costs down. 

Father Brenton Emmons said: 'The 
problem is the symptoms of methanol poisoning are a lot like a hangover 
and people think they can just sleep it off,' he added

'That’s what Cheznye tried to do and she died as a result.'

Now her parents have spoken of their determination to prevent further deaths and prevent other families experiencing such heartbreak.

Mother Pamela Emmons described her daughter as 'lively and outgoing'.

She added: 'She was focused on what she wanted to do with her life. She had lots of friends and had raised money for charity.

'It was like having a chunk of your heart ripped out but we know that she’d be proud of what we’re doing to try to save lives.'

Mr Emmons said: 'In a lot of these countries they mix methanol with spirits and wine without a thought for the dangers.

Cheznye was taken to hospital after suffering loss of sight and seizures. She was kept there for five days until her parents, Brenton and Pamela Emmons, were told there was no more doctors could do for her

Beautician Cheznye and her boyfriend, Joe Cook, both drank from the bottle which they had purchased in a local store. Mr Cook survived the alcohol poisoning in April

'It’s very hard to tell the difference - sometimes there are bits floating in it, sometimes it might smell funny.

'This is being sold in shops, restaurants and bars - places where you might think it is safe. But the message is really "stick to beer" because otherwise you don’t know what risk you are taking.'

Cheznye's parents have spoken of their determination to prevent further deaths and prevent other families experiencing such heartbreak

The family launched their Save a Life Campaign soon after the death and soon hope to distribute 20,000 posters highlighting the dangers to doctors’ surgeries.

Because of how such deaths are recorded abroad, the family say it is impossible to know how many others have died in the same way.

Mr Emmons said that since launching the campaign they have become aware of hundreds of other cases of people falling ill, with some dying.

Ms Emmons was on a six-month trip travelling around Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.

She had been staying in the local Rain Forrest Lodge when she fell ill, the inquest heard.

Others in her group also reported feeling ill.

Coroner Eleanor McGann concluded Ms Emmons died as a result of misadventure.

She said: 'It is clear that she went off travelling expecting to enjoy life and to learn. Sadly this ended in her tragic death.'

Methanol, which is also called methyl
 alcohol, is used in numerous industrial applications, including the 
production of formaldehyde, acetic acid and as a fuel component.

In 2009 two Britons were among 25 people to die in Indonesia after drinking palm wine spiked with methanol.

Alan Cole, 59, and Rose Johnson, 48, died in separate incidents after consuming traditional arak. Rachel Craig, 22, from Ireland and her boyfriend Rene Puper, 23, who was Dutch, were also among the dead.

In June last year Swede Johan Lundin, 28, was poisoned by a mojito laced with methanol. His fiancee, Michaela Pechac, watched in horror as he died.

In December an Australian schoolgirl was blinded after drinking a tainted cocktail while on a trip to Bali. An 18-year-old boy was also temporarily blinded during a trip to Bali in November.

In February 19 year-old Liam Davies from Perth died after a vodka mixer was laced with methanol in Lombok.
