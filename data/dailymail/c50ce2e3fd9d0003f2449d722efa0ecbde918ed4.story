In the dock: Singer Dane Bowers has appeared at Norwich Magistrates' Court charged with racially aggravated assault during a stag weekend

Singer Dane Bowers has appeared in court charged with racially aggravated assault during a stag weekend.

Bowers, 32, who had seven top ten hits with boy band Another Level between 1997 and 2000 and used to date model Katie Price, was arrested following an alleged incident in Norwich earlier this month.

He yesterday pleaded not guilty to two charges of racially aggravated assault and one of causing racially aggravated harassment at Norwich Magistrates Court.

Bowers, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2010, was said to have committed the assault at around 5am on Saturday June 2.

Bowers, of Coulsdon, Surrey, was given unconditional bail. The case has been adjourned until August 17.

Richard
Bayliss, defending, said: 'He emphatically denies the charges brought 
against him. He is extremely upset at any suggestion of any racial 
hostility on his part.'

Bowers
revealed in a Tweet on June 1 that he was 'looking forward' to a stag 
weekend in Norwich playing golf for the first time in months. He added: 
'Could be a long day'.

A 
spokesman for Norfolk Police confirmed that Bowers had been charged 
after an early hours incident in Prince of Wales Road, which is the 
nightclub area of Norwich.

Bowers had a UK number one with Another 
Level in 1998 with his hit Freak Me. The band had a platinum-selling 
first album and had a Brit Awards nomination as Best UK Newcomers in 
1999.

He later launched a solo singing career and moved into music production.

He started a television career in 2002 when he co-hosted Popstars: The Rivals 'Extra' show.

He regularly DJs at clubs across Britain and in Spain.

Bowers was famously in a relationship with model Katie Price between 1998 and 2000. The two remain friends.

He married his agent Chrissy Johnston in Las Vegas in 2007, but they separated in 2009.
