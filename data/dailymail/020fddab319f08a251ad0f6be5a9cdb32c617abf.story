Former teacher Emma Mitchell decided to abandon both her clothes and the classroom to become a stand-up comedian at the Edinburgh Festival

A former private school teacher has turned her back on education to star in her own one woman comedy show - totally NAKED - much to the approval of some of her former pupils.

Emma Mitchell, 43, taught English at Sutton Valence School in Maidstone, Kent, but decided to have a career change.

Now - under her stage name Miss Glory Pearl - Ms Mitchell is putting on her own show at the Edinburgh Festival next week titled ‘The Naked Stand Up.’

Ms Mitchell, who won ‘most sarcastic teacher’ in the sixth form year book many times, came up with the idea while vacuuming her home.

She said: 'After I decided I wanted to do stand up, my next thought was what to wear, as an outfit tends to pigeonhole how you’re perceived as a comedian.

'I was struggling to think of a style and I thought "I’ll just go naked" and then realised The Naked Stand Up sounded pretty good, so I went from there.

'I’m not brave, I’m just past caring. It is just a body. I think we are so much more than a body.'

Ms Mitchell, from Tonbridge, Kent, added: 'I enjoyed teaching but I felt like I was giving the kids all of my creativity and ideas, which I don’t resent them for.'

'I think they used to think I was a bit different to the other teachers. I was awarded most sarcastic teacher a few years.

'Stand up is similar to teaching in a classroom in that you have to stand in front of an audience and command their attention.

'The classic thing you need to know about me is that I used to be a school teacher. A secondary school teacher. So if any of you do want to talk at the back during the show, you will be seeing me afterwards. And I will be keeping you behind. Just to let you know it's your time you're wasting, not mine.'

'I’ve seen some of my former pupils at my previous shows. They think it’s great.'

The teacher-turned comic quit her teaching job in 2005 after seven years in the role.

She took a pay cut to work in advertising and became a pole dancing instructor and then a burlesque dancer in 2008 to boost her income.

Ms Mitchell will perform her naked stand up show at the Edinburgh Festival from August 1 to 24, with only one night off on the 12th.

Her dry humoured script is based on observational jokes and pokes fun at the laws surrounding nudity.
