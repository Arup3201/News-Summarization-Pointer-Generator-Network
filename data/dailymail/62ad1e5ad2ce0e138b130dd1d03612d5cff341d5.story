A Tasmanian Tiger Snake will be cared for by humans for the rest of her life after being diagnosed with a rare condition which will eventually cause her spine to fuse.

Dubbed Rocky, after being found in the Rocky Hills, on the east coast of Tasmania, on Saturday afternoon, the 60cm female is believed to be only one of just 16 snakes in the world to suffer from Charcot's Disease.

Now in the safe hands of Reptile Rescue Tasmania, the staff were gobsmacked to discover from x-rays that Rocky has an incredible 28 lumps along her spine which are at least the size of marbles - if not larger.

Rocky the Tasmanian tiger snake will spend the rest of her days in captivity after being diagnosed with a rare condition which will eventually cause her spine to fuse

An x-ray revealed that Rocky has an incredible 28 growths along her spine as large as marbles - if not bigger

Reptile Rescue Tasmania CEO Bruce Press said he got a big shock when he found Rocky in a hole

Rocky can no longer breed, raise her tail to go the toilet or climb trees - which is a favourite past time of tiger snakes - therefore she can never be released into the wild.

'She's not allowed to breed because she will pass on the genes and it's currently mating season so we need to keep her away from males,' Reptile Rescue Tasmania CEO Bruce Press, told Daily Mail Australia.

But Mr Press said the good news was Rocky is suffering little or no pain.

'She moves around on the ground as well and as fast as any another snake,' he said.

'We had a good look at the x-rays and the spine is nowhere near looking like fusing yet so she has a good many years left in her.' 

However, when the spine eventually fuses Mr Press said the most humane action was for her to be euthanased.

He said he got the shock of his life when he pulled Rocky out of a hole with a hook.

'I thought "Oh My god",' he said. 'I didn't know whether she had a disease or an infection - or someone had tried to kill her.'

Mr Press estimates she is about 12-18 months old but says it was hard to gauge with her abnormal spine.

'She's a freak of nature - her head is significantly bigger compared to her body length,' he said.

'The growths are just ginormous - it's just shocking - so she could be four years old.' 

Aside from her spine, he described her as 'well-hydrated' and an 'extremely healthy specimen' who ate four small mice last night.

Rocky has created worldwide attention with Mr Press receiving more than 300 phone calls since she was diagnosed with the rare condition just 24 hours ago.

But she is expected to live for years as her spine is not near fusing and is an 'extremely healthy specimen'
