James Blunt's lavish wedding reception was mired in controversy last night after it emerged it was at the centre of an official probe for going ahead without permission.

The singer-songwriter and his society beauty wife Sofia Wellesley were caught up in a furore over their use of a secluded beach near Ibiza Town to celebrate the private upmarket do.

Locals enjoying an afternoon out at the pretty hideaway of S'Estanyol vented their fury on Twitter after workers took over the cove to start setting up a storage tent and tables and chairs for 150 people on the sand.

Some complained they had felt so uncomfortable they had headed home early.

And there were even allegations non-guests had been turned away by event promotors with reflective armbands as they drove into the area.

Last night, the local council announced it had launched an investigation and said it would be taking action against the organisers of the weekend event for staging the do without permission.

Local coastal management chiefs were also reported to have opened a separate probe into claims the wedding banquet may have breached laws governing the use of public spaces.

The Saturday night-time do took place a day after former army captain James and his wife, the granddaughter of the 8th Duke of Wellington, blessed their civil wedding at a London registry office with a religious ceremony on the neighbouring island of Majorca.

Prince Harry, a friend from their days in the Household Cavalry, was expected to attend the wedding blessing and reception on Ibiza, where James owns a home.

But a Majorcan-based wedding events firm confirmed last week James, 40, and legal consultant Sofia had married secretly and no royal would be attending the Majorca blessing and Ibiza bash.

The singer, who achieved worldwide fame with the singles 'You're Beautiful' and 'Goodbye My Lover', has not been personally accused of any wrongdoing.

It was unclear last night where town hall chiefs and coastal officials would end up pointing the finger.

A spokesman for Santa Eularia Council, which covers S'Estanyol, said: 'I can confirm we have launched disciplinary proceedings over an alleged misdemeanour.

'The event organisers had the obligation to ask us for permission before staging a private do of this kind and that didn't happen.

'We've also informed the coastal authorities given that a private use was made of a public space and there may also have been an infringement of the rules there if they too weren't informed.

'No official complaints were made to the local police on the day but we are aware of complaints being made on social networking sites.

'We are actively investigating those complaints although the probe is still at an early stage.'

A source said: 'It's unlikely James Blunt and his wife will be held responsible unless it can be shown they obliged the organisers to occupy the beach in the way they did without permission.

'It's impossible to say at the moment but I imagine this will end up with the company behind the organisation of the event getting a fine.'

The newly-wedded couple are thought to have flown to Ibiza from Majorca on Saturday morning.

Onlookers said James, said to have compromised on his first choice of Ibiza for his wedding so it could take place on Majorca where his in-laws own a home, dressed formally in a suit and white shirt for the beach banquet while his wife wore a skirt and halter neck blouse.

One furious local, venting his rage on Twitter that the private event had gone ahead in a popular cove, wrote: 'Can someone tell the mayor of Santa Eularia that S'Estanyol is a public beach.'

Another said: 'A group of five people that were on the beach had to leave because they didn't feel comfortable.'

Javier Aras, owner of the popular PK2 beach restaurant at S'Estanyol which the event took place by, said: 'All I provided was my bar after the banquet.

'The event outside was organised on the beach by another Ibiza-based company and they told me they had all the necessary permits. It had nothing to do with me.

'If I receive notification of disciplinary action from anyone, I'm going to give them that firm's name and tell them to deal with them.

'I have to say though that the event didn't start till 9pm when there was no-one else on the beach and the people who were putting out tables and chairs in the afternoon didn't upset anyone.

'The idea that non-guests were being diverted elsewhere is ludicrous. It just didn't happen.

'Ibiza depends on tourism and this furore is to do more political infighting at the town hall than anything else.

'I met James on the night and like the rest of the guests who were there, he seemed like a really nice bloke.'

A spokesman for The Shop Ibiza, the company he named as the organisers, said: 'We just rent equipment. We rented out equipment to someone. We weren't the promoter. It's not our concern.

'I'm not going to talk about who my clients are and how my business is provided.

'But it will be the promotor who receives a fine if there is a fine and I'm not aware of any fine at the moment.'

No-one was available from (M)OMENTS, the Majorcan-based wedding events firm which press-released on James's wedding last week to inform he and his wife were requesting privacy and no royals had been invited.

James and Edinburgh University law graduate Sofia were first introduced to each other by his sister Daisy.

The couple got engaged in December 2013 after dating for a year.

In March 2012 government officials in Majorca fined model Mark Vanderloo for celebrating his wedding to fellow model Robin Van der Meer in s'Espalmador without permission.
