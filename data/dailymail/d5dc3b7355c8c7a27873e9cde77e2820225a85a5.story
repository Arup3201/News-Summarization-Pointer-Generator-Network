A county prosecutor has been fired after admitting to posing as a murder suspect's ex-girlfriend on Facebook in a bid to get the alibi witnesses to change their story.

Aaron Brockler, who formerly worked for Cuyahoga County in Ohio, insisted he had done nothing wrong as his intention was simply to get a killer off the street by revealing that the alibi was made up.

'Law enforcement, including prosecutors, 
have long engaged in the practice of using a ruse to obtain the truth,' Brockler told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 'I think the public 
is better off for what I did.'

He said that the alibi witnesses had indeed said their initial stories were not true.

Tactics: Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Aaron Brockler, left, was fired after posing as a fictitious ex-girlfriend of murder suspect Damon Dunn, right, in a bid to get his alibi witnesses to reveal if their story was true

But County Prosecutor Timothy J. McGinty, who fired Brockler, called the actions 'unethical' and said he had brought shame on the office.

Brockler, 35, was the lead prosecutor in the case of Damon Dunn, 29, who was accused of gunning down Kenneth 'Blue' Adams in May 2012 at a car wash where the victim worked.

During preparation stages for the trial, Dunn provided attorneys with the names of two women he said could testify he was on the other side of the city at the time of the shooting.

'Unless I could break this guy's alibi a
murderer might be walking on the street,' Brockler told the Plain Dealer. 'There was such a small window 
of opportunity, I had to act fast.'

Denial: Brockler, with his wife, said he had done nothing wrong as he was trying to get a killer off the streets

Plot: He said that the women had changed their stories after speaking with the fake girlfriend

He said that he used Facebook to chat with the two witnesses, posing as a fictitious former girlfriend who he said had given birth's to Dunn's child. Brockler said the women were enraged at learning this.

He met with the women the next day, but did not reveal he had been the one speaking to them.

Brockler claimed that one of the women said she hadn't been with Dunn at the time of the murder after all, while the other said: 'This is bogus, I'm not going to lie for him.'

He told Dunn's defense lawyer that the alibi had fallen apart and saved copies of the Facebook chats in a file, with no intention of hiding them, he told the Plain Dealer.

He then left the office for medical leave for two months and, during that time, was called by the assistant county prosecutor who was filling in his role.

The colleague asked him about the Facebook chats in the file. Brockler said they had been him and the colleague told supervisors.

The Facebook transcripts were given to a Cleveland homicide detective, who traced their creation to Brockler's computer in the Justice Center.

Brockler had meetings with supervisors and was open about what he had done. He was fired from the position and the Attorney General's office has taken over the case.

'By creating false 
evidence, lying to witnesses as well as another prosecutor, Aaron 
Brockler has damaged the prosecution's chances in a murder case where a 
totally innocent man was killed at his work,' McGinty said.

But Brockler insists he has been unfairly dismissed and that he had simply been motivated by sympathy for the victim's mother.

'I made a promise to her that he wasn’t going 
to walk out the front door of the courthouse,' he said. 'This was a horrible killer
and I didn’t want him to get out and go kill someone else's son.'

He called his treatment 'a massive overreaction'.

'I did what the Cleveland police detectives should have done before I got the file,' he said.

The next hearing in Dunn's case is scheduled for later this month.
