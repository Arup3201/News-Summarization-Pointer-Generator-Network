A pensioner and his 16-year-old granddaughter have died after being buried alive by a landslide in an Italian village as storms batter the north of the country. 

Giorgio Levati, 70, and his granddaughter Adriana De Pena Moya were trapped under mountains of rubble at the family's two storey villa in Cerro, near Lake Maggiore yesterday.

The house was partially buried in a 'sea of mud' after the rain-sodden hill behind the building gave way. The pensioner died under the rubble.

Rescue workers managed to drag Adriana from the rubble after more than four hours of digging but she died later in hospital.

Her parents and grandmother survived. The family's small, two-storey villa was the only property affected in Cerro, a hamlet on the outskirts of Laveno Mombello, a popular holiday spot.

A neighbour described how he had been awoken during the night by a huge bang 'like fireworks', and seeing rescue workers and the girl's parents 'digging with spades, even with their bare hands'.

'It was a horrific scene,' the neighbour told Italian television.

The tragedy means a total of 11 people have died in Italy in accidents related to the freak weather conditions in just over a month.

A wave of storms and torrential rain is hitting many parts of northern Italy. It has seen the Liguria region hit with as much rain in the first 15 days of November as it normally gets in an entire year

The tragedies occurred just one day after storms in southern France left five people dead as their cars were swept away in flooding.

On Friday, rescue workers managed to drag a father trapped in his car, lodged on a bridge, only to see the vehicle with his wife and two young sons still inside ripped away by the water.

On Sunday in Switzerland, the bodies of two women, aged 34 and 38, were pulled from the rubble of the three-story apartment building in Davesco-Soragno, near Lugano, after being hit by the mudslide shortly before 2.30am local time, police said.

A 44-year-old Italian man, who was living with one of the women, had been dug out and taken to hospital in a critical condition, police told reporters.

Four others in the building at the time it collapsed had escaped with only minor injuries, while the final resident had not been home.

A wall above the building had crumbled under the rain and set off the landslide, police said.

That tragedy came 10 days after a young mother and her three-year-old daughter were killed when a landslide swept away their house in the same region.

After weeks of heavy rain, southern Ticino has been hit by severe flooding, which worsened when Lake Lugano burst its banks in several places and Lake Maggiore threatened to do the same. 

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, speaking from the G20 summit in Australia, said the havoc wreaked by the heavy rain was the result of years of neglect of infrastructure.

'We have had 20 years of land management that needs to be scrapped,' he said.

An estimated 70 coffins meanwhile were washed away after 50 metres of retaining wall in a cemetery in the Bolzaneto district of Genoa collapsed.

Local residents reported skulls and other bones washing up on the banks of the Polcevera river.
