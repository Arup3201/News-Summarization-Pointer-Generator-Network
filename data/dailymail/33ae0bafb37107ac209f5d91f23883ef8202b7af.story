A  twin who was one of the most premature ever to survive  is set to defy doctors by taking his first steps – thanks to Botox injections.

Two-year-old Archie Garthwaite was diagnosed with cerebral palsy in June, after a host of complications when he and his brother Harley were born 17 weeks early.

Doctors told his devastated parents Hayley Kennedy, 22, and Billy Garthwaite, 23, that he would never walk.

But Archie defied medics to learn to crawl and doctors are now preparing to inject his legs with Botox, which they say could relax his tightened muscles and help him walk.

Ms Kennedy, from Hartlepool, Cleveland, said: 'At first the doctors said he would never walk and it absolutely broke my heart for him.

'But now they've come up with the idea of Botox and a walking frame because they're really impressed at how much he's come on.

'His physio says it's incredible.  It has given us a renewed hope for him.'

Although Botox first achieved fame as a cosmetic drug used by celebrities to smooth out wrinkles, it also has a number of medical uses such as treating migraines and incontinence.

Botox uses tiny amounts of botulinum toxin, derived from the bacteria that cause botulism food poisoning. The deadly nerve agent kills by paralysing the muscles used for breathing.

Cerebral palsy is the general term for a number of neurological conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.

Specifically, cerebral palsy is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles, according to the NHS website.

The condition can occur if the brain develops abnormally or is damaged before, during or shortly after birth. 

The main symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life.

They are: Muscle stiffness or floppiness, muscle weakness, random and uncontrolled body movements, balance and co-ordination problems. 

Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected.

How Botox can help

Botox uses tiny amounts of botulinum toxin, derived from the bacteria that cause botulism food poisoning.

The deadly nerve agent kills by paralysing the muscles used for breathing.

In tiny doses it relaxes the contraction of muscles in some people with cerebral palsy by blocking nerve impulses.

This allows better control of movement and reduces the risk of muscle and tendon shortening. The effects last between four and six months.

Although Botox treatment is now becoming more common for some cerebral palsy patients, not all NHS Trusts will fund it and there are often long waiting lists for treatment.

Archie was diagnosed with cerebral palsy earlier this year.

This followed a series of complications when he and his brother were born 17 weeks early, and became the most premature twins ever to survive in the UK at that time.

They were delivered at just 23 weeks, on June 13 and 14, 2012, weighing just 1lb 4oz and 1lb 6oz – much less than the UK average of 7lb 8oz.

The boys both had holes in their tiny hearts and at just two weeks old Archie had to undergo open heart surgery, with his brother Harley following two weeks later.

Medics also operated to correct bowel problems, performed laser treatment on their underdeveloped eyes, and put them on ventilators and oxygen to help them to breathe.

But despite the odds, the pair survived and while Harley has eyesight and lung problems, he can walk and talk like any normal toddler.

Archie's cerebral palsy means his muscle's don't work as well, and he can't talk as well as his brother.

But regular physiotherapy has seen him learn to crawl and now it is hoped the Botox - usually used to smooth wrinkles - will relax his tightened legs. 

The twins' recovery was hailed as a miracle given how premature and unwell they were. They are pictured with parents Hayley Kennedy, 22, and Billy Garthwaite, 23, two years ago 

While Archie (far right) can't walk and just makes noises rather than talking - Harley (far left) can understand him and tells parents Hayley Kennedy, and Billy Garthwaite (pictured) what he wants

Ms Kennedy, who is Archie's full-time carer, said: 'There is a lot of brotherly love. Harley will get two of everything, one for him and one for Archie.

'It breaks my heart because I always wonder if Archie is thinking 'why can't I do what Harley is doing?'

'Archie doesn't talk as much, he just makes noises, but Harley knows what Archie wants and he tells us so that we know.

'They are both a credit to us. I do cry on a night - I wouldn't wish what they've been through on anyone.

'I think "poor little souls". It's awful but they are getting there. I wouldn't be without them.'

He stunned medics by learning to crawl and will now have Botox injections

It is hoped these will relax his muscles and help him  walk like his brother
