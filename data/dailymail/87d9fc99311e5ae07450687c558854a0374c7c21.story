It's not just humans who have a furry friend, you know.

Kali the incredibly cute polar bear cub has one too -Â  his very own teddy bear.

Visitors can barely take their eyes off as he's formed an inseparable friendship with the stuffed toy after being rescued by zoo staff who found him isolated off the Northwest Alaska coast.

Kali was cared for by specialists at Alaska Zoo, but still struggled to cope without his mother - who is believed to have been killed by hunters.

But when keepers gave him a giant brown teddy bear to cuddle up to, the youngster immediately cuddled up to the lifelike toy and form an adorable relationship.

Kali has since been moved to Buffalo Zoo, New York, from the specialist Alaska Zoo, and has his teddy bear his side at all times.

He has even found a new playmate after meeting up with another cub Luna.

A spokesman for Buffalo Zoo said: 'Kali has been with us since May and is doing very well. He's become a close companion for Luna, the cub who was born here last November and hand-raised by our staff.

'The first day was a little nerve-racking for everybody, but now they're playing. The cubs are getting along great.'

Kali was rescued last March by hunters in Alaska, and brought to the Alaska Zoo until a permanent space for him could be found elsewhere.

The Alaska Zoo is the only facility in America with a standing permit to take in orphaned or injured polar bears.

A spokesman for Alaska Zoo said: 'Unfortunately orphaned cubs will not survive in the wild without their mothers care during their first few years so returning them to the wild is not an option.

'Our staff have well over 100 combined years of experience in working with orphaned cubs.'

On May 15, the cub arrived at Buffalo Zoo, where he spent a couple of weeks getting to know his new territory before being put on display with Luna.

He has become a worldwide hit and, along with his teddy bear, is one of the country's most popular stars.
