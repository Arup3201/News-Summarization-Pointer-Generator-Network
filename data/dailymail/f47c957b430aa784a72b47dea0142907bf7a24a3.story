Secret Service Deputy Director Alvin Smith has been forced out of his position after 29 years in the agency

The Secret Service has forced out its deputy director, who has been with the agency for 29 years, as major house cleaning continues following a series of  highly publicized security breaches at the White House.

Alvin 'A.T.' Smith, who managed the agency's day-to-day operations, will resign his position tomorrow but will be allowed to accept another unspecified federal job within the Homeland Security Department, the government said.

Smith's firing follows a purge of the agency's upper management that saw the departure of six out of eight assistant directors last month, as well as the resignation of director Julia Pierson in October. 

Secret Service Acting Director Joseph Clancy called Smith's contributions to the agency 'invaluable' in a statement today. 

Department spokeswoman Marsha Catron said Smith will take a job with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit. 

She did not specify what Smith's job title would be or whether he would have a supervisory position.

After Clancy removed the four assistant directors who oversaw protection, investigations, technology and public affairs last month, some members of Congress publicly questioned why Smith hadn't been fired as well, according to the Washington Post. 

Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz called Smith 'a part of the problem, not part of the solution', and said he worried the deputy director was at the center of the agency's recent bad decisions.

Chaffetz and Maryland Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings commended the agency today for its recent job changes. 

Smith's firing is part of a major agency house cleaning led by acting director Joseph Clancy, who dumped four assistant directors last month after a report revealed the Secret Service was 'starved for leadership'

The once elite Secret Service has suffered from a string of embarrassing scandals recently, including a drunk federal employee crashing a drone onto the White House lawn and a knife-wielding man that ran through most of the mansion's main floor before agent members could bring him down.

The agency's woes only deepened in December when a panel selected by the Department of Homeland Security said the Secret Service was 'starved for leadership' and hurting from low morale. 

Following the report, Clancy said in a statement to the Washington Post that he believed the change was 'necessary to gain a fresh perspective on how we conduct business'. 

The White House has seen a string of security breaches in recent years, with over 40 fence jumpers making it on to the estate in the past five years, including four in just the last year. 

Other incidents have included a wandering toddler, a naked man, and eager reality stars. 

October 2014: Dominic Adesanya jumped the fence and made it onto the North Lawn before being taken down by two security dogs  and arrested by the Secret Service.

September 2014: Omar J. Gonzalez, an Iraq army veteran with a knife in his pants, scaled the fence from the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House and made it inside. He overpowered an officer at the entrance and ran through most of the main floor and made it to the East Room before he was finally captured.

The shocking security breach  launched congressional hearings and led to Secret Service director Julie Pierson's resignation.

Just 24 hours later college student Kevin Carr was arrested for trespassing after he parked his car at a security checkpoint outside the estate and refused to leave. 

And in the same month a man wearing a Pikachu hat and carrying a plush doll of the Pokemon jumped the fence and walked on to the North Lawn.

August 2014: The White House went on lockdown after a toddler somehow managed to squeeze through the gates.

May 2014: A man was arrested for indecent exposure after stripping off all his clothes when he was denied access outside the White House. 

June 2013: Joseph Reed crashed a driverless jeep filled with bullets, knives and two machetes into the Pennsylvania Ave. gate, hoping to create a diversion so he could spray paint a 'Don't tread on me' snake - a symbol sometimes associated with the Tea Party movement - on the side of the White House.

November 2009: In one of the most famous and extensive of breaches, reality TV stars Michaele and Tareq Salahi from Bravo show The Real Housewives of D.C. slipped past two Secret Service checkpoints and managed to crash a state dinner party that they were not on the guest list for.
