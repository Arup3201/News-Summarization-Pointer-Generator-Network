Boris Johnson was roundly criticised today after calling for British citizens travelling to Iraq and Syria to automatically be stripped of their passports.

Richard Barrett, a former MI6 security chief, said the threat from ISIS was ‘unproven’ and needed to be better understood before new laws were rushed through.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg added that new legislation to combat the threat posed by British jihadists returning from the Middle East would not remove the danger from Islamic State extremists.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said he would like to see 'Jihadi John' killed in a bomb attack on Syria

Intelligence agencies are close to identifying the brutal killer of US journalist James Foley, believed to be a British extremist who has been dubbed ‘jihadi John’.

Mr Johnson said Britain must take on ISIS and ‘try to close it down now’, warning that doing nothing would mean a ‘tide of terror will eventually lap at our own front door’.

The mayor, who has overall responsibility for the Metropolitan Police, called for new laws that would mean anyone visiting Iraq and Syria would be automatically presumed to be terrorists unless they had notified the authorities in advance.

Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson said: ‘Young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in 'battle' they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins.

‘Many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to 'black-eyed virgins' is in fact a promise of 72 raisins. I suspect most of us don't give a monkey's what happens to this prat in heaven, whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible.’

But Mr Barrett, former global counter-terrorism director of MI6, told The Guardian: ‘This fundamental tenet of British justice should not be changed even in a minor way for this unproven threat - and it is an unproven threat at the moment.’

He said the Government needed to understand better the domestic threat posed by ISIS before introducing new laws.

‘I don't think we should change the laws without a very much more thorough assessment and understanding of the threat,’ he said.

‘Sure, there's a problem with people who go to Syria and they may have broken the law if they joined organisations like Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, but there should be some sort of effort to prove that, rather than assume they've done so.’

And former attorney general Dominic Grieve said Mr Johnson's suggestion that those travelling to Iraq and Syria should be presumed guilty was ‘draconian’. 

One suspect in the brutal murder of US journalist James Foley is the British 23-year-old Abdel-Majed abdel Bary

Bary - an amateur rapper from London - is believed to have travelled to Syria last year. His Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Osama bin Laden and the 1998 US Embassy bombings in Africa

Speaking during a visit to India, Mr Clegg added: ‘I think the issue is incredibly important, that we should make sure that those young men, and it is invariably young men, who are attracted to this hateful ideology that draws them to the bloodshed and conflict in places like Syria and Iraq, they shouldn't be able to come back and do harm on the streets of British towns, villages and cities, and that is now our number one priority.

‘It's what the police, the authorities and security services are working flat out on; I have huge confidence in the outstanding work they do.

‘With the greatest respect to Boris Johnson, I will listen to what they tell me they need rather than what he says.

‘We actually have a number of measures already on the statute book which allow us to keep a very close eye on those people who aren't in prison, aren't sentenced, but nonetheless are perceived to be a threat to the United Kingdom.

‘And of course, we will continue to review all the powers on the recommendation of the police and security services that may be deemed to be necessary to deal with this very serious issue.’

He added: ‘I sometimes wish it was as simple as Boris Johnson implies: all we need to do is pass a law and everything will be well.’
