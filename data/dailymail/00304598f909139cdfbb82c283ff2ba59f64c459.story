A Far Right group used pictures of former television star Lynda Bellingham to attract visitors to its website.

Britain First, a group which promotes fascist views with the slogan ‘Taking our country back’, posted pictures of Mrs Bellingham hours after her death and tricked users to like and share the pictures.

Facebook users clicking 'like' on the pictures were not aware that they had been posted by Britain First, a splinter group of the British National Party.

The Facebook sharing of the picture of Mrs Bellingham, with All Creatures Great and Small co-star Christopher Timothy, meant that Britain First’s website attracted hundreds more views.

Posts on the page’s Facebook site include comments such as calls for British Muslims to be ‘wiped out’ and all non-whites deported.

Mrs Bellingham, who starred in the OXO adverts and was a panellist on television programme Loose Women, died on Sunday at the age of 66 after a battle with colon cancer.

She died in the arms of her husband Michael Pattemore, after the disease spread from her colon to other parts of her body.

Since her death, people across Britain have paid tribute to the former actress. Her final appearance on Loose Women, which aired on Wednesday, attracted two million views – double the television programme’s normal viewing figures.

Yesterday, Prince Charles said: ‘She was not only a marvellous actress but also someone who worked tirelessly for others. So she really will be hugely missed.’

The heir to the throne added that he was ‘greatly saddened’ by her death. He made the comments at the launch of a report that found Britain must make better use of older workers.

For the final two years of her life, Mrs Bellingham had been an ambassador for the Prince’s Initiative for Mature Enterprise (Prime) which helps the over-50s start their own companies. 

The organisation is now part of Prince Charles’s charity Business In The Community. Prince Charles described Mrs Bellingham as a ‘wonderful ambassador for Prime’.
