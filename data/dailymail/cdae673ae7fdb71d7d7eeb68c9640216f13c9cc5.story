They sport the colours of the Brazilian flag and are flavoured, appropriately, like the nation's favourite cocktail.

So its no wonder that these special-edition Prudence condoms, available only in Brazil, have been branded the unofficial contraceptive of the World Cup.

Coloured yellow and green like the national team's strip, they are flavoured to taste like Brazil's signature cocktail, the Caipirinha, which is made with limes, sugar and cacha√ßa, a kind of white rum.

The Wall Street Journal reports that 700,000 packs of the 3.15 reais (83p) condoms have been sold at supermarkets and pharmacies in Brazil since hitting the stores in February.

They are made by Malaysian firm Karex, the world's largest condom maker, which has just delivered a further 864,000 packs of the capirinha condoms to Brazil this week.

The design and marketing of the condoms is handled by DKT International, a global family planning and HIV-prevention non-profit.

DKT's Brazil director, Daniel Marun, told WSJ: 'Major sports or cultural events attract a great number of people and garner much attention, providing a good opportunity to spread a pleasurable and fun safe-sex message.'

Brazil's World Cup has already been lauded as the 'sexiest tournament ever', with the sun and samba set to lead to plenty of something else, apparently.

However, it has also reportedly led to an explosion of prostitution, prompting fears of the spread of AIDS.

The efforts of DKT have been bolstered by those of UN HIV-prevention organisation UNAIDS, whose 'Protect The Goal' programme has has been handing out free condoms and HIV tests in World Cup cities.

Brazil usually conducts HIV and AIDS prevention campaigns during the Carnival holiday, including widespread advertising and condom distribution.

Aggressive HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention efforts in the South American country have been held up as a model for the developing world for more than a decade.
