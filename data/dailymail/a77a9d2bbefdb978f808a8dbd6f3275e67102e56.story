As the world continued to search for answers over the downing of Flight MH17, the internet came alive with conspiracy theories today.

The Web has long been a haven for numerologists and conspiracy crackpots peddling their alternative analyses of events that shake the world.

And today was no different as web sleuths across the globe rushed online in a bid to hypothesize over what really happened to the doomed Malaysian Airlines passenger plane . . .

All seeing eye: The Illuminati insignia is on the American dollar bill. Many modern conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by the Illuminati. Some believe the group was behind the Battle of Waterloo, the French Revolution and JFK's assassination

Russia Today sparked a fever of speculation last night after publishing a report that claimed the doomed flight was flying almost the exact same path as Putin's presidential plane did less than 40 minutes later.

It quoted a source as telling Interfax news agency: 'I can say that Putin’s plane and the Malaysian Boeing intersected at the same point and the same echelon.

The presidential plane: Russia Today pointed out that Putin's presidential plane bears uncannily similar red and blue markings to those painted on all Malaysian Airlines craft, including MH17

'That was close to Warsaw on 330-m echelon at the height of 10,100 meters. The presidential jet was there at 16:21 Moscow time and the Malaysian aircraft—15:44 Moscow time.'

It goes on to point out that Putin's presidential plane bears uncannily similar red and blue markings to those painted on all Malaysian Airlines craft.

Did US president Barack Obama actually order the strike in a bid to assassinate Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin? Some Twitter users think so...

Bumbled assassination attempt? Within minutes of the report, Twitter was flooded by claims the shooting was merely a mistake by bumbling assassins

Within minutes of the report, Twitter was flooded by claims the shooting was a botched assassination attempt.

Some even took it to mean US president Barack Obama ordered the C.I.A. to carry out the alleged hit.

'#OBAMA TRYING TO KILL #PUTIN #Putin's plane was following 'almost same route' as crashed #MalaysianAirlines #MH17,' gushed one excited user.

Another blamed banking dynasty the Rosthchild Family.

'ROTHSCHILDS TRIED TO KILL PUTIN & HIT WRONG PLANE TODAY - ALL BECAUSE OF BRICS BANK & USD END - HOW STUPID COULD THIS ZIONIST IDIOT BE?,' Dave Rocki blasted.

Many have claimed that The Illuminati carried out the attack as part of its longstanding masterplan to trigger a third world war and thus establish a New World Order ... chiefly because of the plane's links to the number seven.

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was a Boeing 777 and made its maiden flight on July 17, 1997 - 17 years ago to the day, many theorists point out.

On top of that, July is the seventh month of 2014. Adding up the year's numbers (2+0+1+4) makes seven.

Glover wrote on Twitter: '#planecrash #Malay #Plane a #False #Flag? to 
escalate war & tensions -numbers though? Date 17/ 7 Flight 17 plane 
#777 #conspiracy #theory ?'

A writer on conspiracy website Before It’s News claimed the tragedy was 'clearly' an attempted false flag to launch a new global war.

They wrote: 'The occult/illuminati connection to this plane crash are laid out in the video below and are absolutely stunning as the NWO (New World Order) attempts to start WW3 as their grip on power falls apart as the US dollar dies and on the same day TWA Flight 800 was shot down in 1996.'

The number
 seven is a figure that has long been associated with the clandestine 
group, who are said to view it as the essence of perfection.

The Illuminati did it: Many sought to link The ancient Illuminati with the atrocity because of its links the number seven

Blogger IlluminatiWatcher.com wrote: 'I followed the previous Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 (exhaustively) and concluded that it must've been aliens; one of the first conspiracy theories to surface, and until we hear otherwise I'm sticking with it. In that MH370 conspiracy theories post I referenced the fact that the alleged Illuminati might have been involved due to the number 777 being tied in. You'll notice that this MH17 was also a Boeing 777.'

Reddit user, ISayWhatEvery1Thinks went a step further, writing: 'Mh17 (one seven) – a 777 has been flying for 17 (one seven) years, was shot down during the 17th (one seven) day of the 7th month of 2014.

'2+0+1+4=7.

'295 "souls on board" (Anderson cooper's words) 2+9+5=16 then 1+6 =7. A lot of 7s.'

Far fetched? For some conspiracy theorists the idea alone is better than any proof

Many modern conspiracy theories propose that world events are being controlled and manipulated by the Illuminati, a secretive and ancient society blamed by proponents for a string of world events including the Battle of Waterloo, the French Revolution and President John F. Kennedy's assassination.

There have even been suggestions that the group is in fact a Communist pressure party hellbent on creating a new world order by infiltrating the Hollywood film industry.

MH17 was shot down 17 years to the day since its maiden voyage ...

The group's involvement was further bolstered by a New York Times journalist who revealed the plane was shot down 17 years to the day since its maiden voyage.

C. J. Chivers tweeted: 'Haunting: Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777, Reg 9M-MRD, made 1st flight on 7-17-97. It met its end 17 years later, to the day -aviation official'

A coincidence or not, it was enough proof for many that a sinister plot was to blame.

What really happened? The Web has long been a haven for numerologists and conspiracy crackpots peddling alternative analyses of the events that shake the world

Did Israel mastermind the shoot down to divert world's gaze from its assault on Gaza?

Some people even took to MailOnline's own comment section to expound their hypotheses.

'Benji', from London wrote: 'Did Israel have something to do with it? It's incredibly convenient for the government of Israel that the day before they launch their ground attack on Gaza.

'World attention and media coverage has been diverted from that to this MH17 incident. Could Israel be behind it so they can launch their attack on Palestine, and the inevitable deaths of hundreds of civilians that is likely to come with it, without international media and governmental scrutiny?? hmmmmm.'

Benji didn't stand alone in his analysis today. Max Weedon added on Twitter: 'Missile downs flight #MH17 over Ukraine; Israel begins ground offensive against Hamas. Are the two linked?'

Comrades in alarm: Benji didn't stand alone in his analysis today

Many Twitter users claimed pictures of victims' passports found at the scene were in too good a condition to have possibly been involved in the crash.

'How could the passports found at the #MH17 crash site be so pristine? Wondering if these are authentic,' wrote Mamadoxie.

'Pristine passports': Many Twitter users claimed pictures of victims' passports found at the scene were in too good a condition to have possibly been involved in the crash

Another blasted: 'Look at these passports in pristine condition recovered from teh MH17 crash. Just like the 9/11 passport #falseflag.'

This argument appeared a little less-well researched than some of its counterparts.

But a lack of hard evidence didn't stop theorists sharing their views that MH17 was in fact MH370 - the plane that disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March.

Was International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde in fact the mastermind behind the atrocity?

The IMF Managing Director gave a speech to the National Press Club in Washington D.C. about the power of the number seven.

In the speech she used numerology to make a series of forecasts for 2014 based around the 'magic seven'.

Mistress of the occult? The IMF Managing Director, Christine Lagarde, gave a speech to the National Press Club in Washington D.C. about the power of the number seven

'Now I'm going to test your numerology skills by asking you to think about the magic seven,' she told the audience.

She went on to point out that 
2014 will 'mark the 7th anniversary of the financial market jitters', 
and will be the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 25th (2
 + 5 = 7)'.

She made a series of further references to the number seven that inspired a glut of blog posts and tweets accusing her of sinister occult dealings.

'Not sure if anyone watched the "number 7″ video,' adds ISayWhatEvery1Thinks, 'Christine Lagarde, the chief of the IMF had some pretty cryptic uses of the number 7.'

Natalie Minnis was one of many who took to Twitter today to point out Lagarde's alleged links to the dark arts.

'Was Christine Lagarde trying to give a message about the #MH17 tragedy in her bizarre speech about numerology?' she tweeted.
