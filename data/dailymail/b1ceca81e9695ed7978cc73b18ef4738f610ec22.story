Teachers do not enjoy a life of 'short days and long holidays' but are swamped by on pointless box-ticking, form-filling and unnecessary work, Nick Clegg said today.

The Deputy Prime Minister defended teachers from claims they have an easy life, and promised to tackle their excessive workload.

He urged school staff to highlight examples of paperwork and administration which could be scrapped.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg used a speech at Bellville Primary School in Clapham to promise to cut the workloads of the nation's teachers

International evidence suggests that teachers in England work a 48-hour week on average, with only 20 of those spent in the classroom.

The rest of their time is taken up with tasks such as administration, lesson preparation and marking.

Data shows that England's teachers spend more time on these tasks than those in countries with high-performing education systems.

In a speech in London, Mr Clegg said: 'Some people are still under the misguided impression that it's a profession built around short days and long holidays.

'But talk to a teacher and they'll tell you about their working week of 50 hours or more.

'They'll also tell you how much of this time they feel is wasted on unnecessary processes, box ticking and form filling.'

He said too many teachers spend hours 'struggling to stay on top of piles of incident reports, over-detailed lesson plan templates, health and safety forms, departmental updates, training requests and so on that threaten to engulf them every week'.

He added: 'Some of this work is unavoidable. Every school needs to ensure the safety of its pupils and staff and maintain the highest standards possible.

'But should you really have to fill in multiple risk assessment forms for every school trip when just one form would be better?'

Speaking at a south London school, Mr Clegg said that teachers can submit their ideas for the workload challenge, also supported by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, via a dedicated page on the Times Educational Supplement's (TES) website.

'We're asking teachers across the country to take a long, hard look at how they spend their working day and what pointless processes and paperwork they think should be cut or scrapped altogether,' Mr Clegg said.

The move was welcomed by teaching unions. Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL), said: 'ATL is pleased the coalition Government is finally taking teachers' workloads seriously. It is a tragedy that for so long teachers and school leaders have felt pressurised into doing tasks which do nothing to improve children's education.

'Teachers are spending too many hours on bureaucratic tasks such as five-page lesson plans, or multi-coloured marking, instead of being allowed to focus on effective teaching and learning to meet the needs of their pupils.'

After outlining his plans, Mr Clegg met teachers Camille Hazeldene and Jessica Avison about his plan to cut paperwork in schools

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: ' You can't trust a word Nick Clegg says - he is part of the Government that has denigrated the professionalism of teachers, allowing unqualified teachers into classrooms, dismissing the profession as 'enemies of promise' and letting teacher workload spiral.

'His attempts to distance himself from his own Government's dismal record on teacher workload will be met with great scepticism and the teaching profession will be right to hold him to account for the decisions that he has taken.'Â
