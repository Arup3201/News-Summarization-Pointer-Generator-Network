In his youth: Sydney Swift (pictured as a Lance Sergeant), who helped bury Rifleman Horace Savage, wants his fallen comrade exhumed and re-buried

For seven decades Sydney Swift believed the soldier he buried in a battlefield after his death in front of him was given a proper military funeral and headstone in a cemetery.

But when the 95-year-old British Lance Sergeant’s friends visited the Catania War Cemetery in Sicily, Italy, they could not find any memorial for Rifleman Horace Savage.

The soldier was first buried in unmarked graves along with Rifleman Edwin Pearton and Lance Corporal John Biggs, close to where the three men fell during World War Two in July 1943.

After the war, the bodies of Rfn Pearton and LCpl Biggs were exhumed and they were given a military funeral and headstone at the Sicily cemetery.

It had been presumed that Rfn Savage was also re-buried there after a funeral following his death at Primosole Bridge in Catania, which preceded the mainland Allied Invasion of Italy.

So when friends told Mr Swift they were visiting the cemetery, the great-grandfather asked them to leave flowers on the grave of Rfn Savage.

But they found no headstone for the soldier.

This prompted an investigation by Mr Swift, who found his fallen comrade’s name on the Cassino Memorial at the Cassino War Cemetery in Frosinone.

This site is 370 miles from Sicily on mainland Italy and lists more than 4,000 Commonwealth soldiers who took part in the Italian campaign but whose graves are not known.

Now, despite the passing of seven decades, Mr Swift said he can pinpoint to within a few yards the location of the grave he placed the serviceman in with the help of a stretcher bearer.

With the London Irish Rifles Regimental Association’s backing, he is urging Italian authorities and the Commonwealth War Grave Commission to now bury Rfn Savage with full military honours.

They also want to trace the family of Rfn Savage, who was in the 1st battalion London Irish Rifles.

Mr Swift, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: ‘Last year friends of mine were going to Sicily and asked them to look up the three men killed in action at Primisole Bridge in Catania.

‘They came back and said they had only found two graves. We researched his name and realised it was on the Cassino Memorial as “no known grave”.

‘Well, I know where his grave is 
because I buried him in a ditch that we were holding as a position. It 
was the only time I have buried somebody in my life. I am hardly likely 
to forget it.

The successful push into Italy began in Sicily in July 1943, which led to the collapse of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini's government.

The Sicily invasion, which faced relatively little resistance, was the beginning of the Allied invasion of Axis-controlled Europe.

Allied forces made it into mainland Italy by September that year, landing in the south, and the Italians agreed to surrender.

But the Germans set up huge defensive lines to block any push north, and the Allied attack proved to be long-running and costly.

However the Allies managed to break through and captured Rome in June 1944, two days before D-Day in Normandy, France.

Germany's forces in Italy surrendered on May 1945, six days before the whole country did so.

‘I put a 
marker on the grave. He must still be there. The Commonwealth War Graves
 Commission have told me that if a body is discovered they can arrange 
for a proper burial and a headstone.

‘Somebody needs to go and find him for that to happen. He needs a proper burial and proper grave.’

The
 three men were killed when a 16-man patrol was sent out towards high 
ground in Catania to make contact with the Germans. As they neared the 
enemy line German machine guns opened up.

Mr
 Swift and a stretcher bearer recovered a mortally-wounded Rfn Savage 
and carried him back to a dressing station 400 yards away, where he died
 a few minutes later.

Mr Swift said: ‘The men had been mown 
down by machine gun fire and Savage had been shot. Two stretcher bearers
 were told to recover him but one of them was too frightened so I went.

‘The Germans were very fair and didn’t
 fire on us and allowed us to bring Savage back to the ambulance. He was
 in a lot of pain and was delirious.

'We couldn’t do anything for him and
 he died at the ambulance. We buried him out of sight in the ditch.

‘I
 was very upset as he was a friend and it was probably due to the trauma
 that I forgot to take his identity tags and personal possessions of 
him. I think he had a ring on his finger. I don’t know why he wasn’t 
found.’

Details of where dead soldiers ended up were often recorded contemporaneously in the regimental war diaries.

After the fighting had moved on or even 
after the war had finished the Commonwealth War Graves Commission 
located as many men as possible and buried them in local war cemeteries.

But due to the ‘fog of war’, the records were sometimes missing or incomplete and many men were forgotten about.

London Irish Regimental Association spokesman Nigel Wilkinson said: ‘Mr Swift believes that he can still locate Savage’s grave and desperately wants to see his comrade buried beside his friends before he dies. It is right that he should be properly buried.’

Peter Francis, of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, said: ‘If a set of remains were discovered and confirmed to be a Commonwealth serviceman they would be presented to us for proper burial. We would mark the grave and care for it.’
