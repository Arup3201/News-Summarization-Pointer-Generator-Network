Relatives of a Sandy Hook shooting victim have spoken out for the first time about opposing gun control saying they feel lumped together with other families from the tragedy in favor of new laws.

Though Rachel D'Avino, a teacher at the Newtown elementary school, was shot to death by a crazed gunman, her family still owns firearms - including an assault-style rifle - and is against any measures to control their purchase, according to her sister Hannah.

For the first time the D'Avinos said they wanted to outline their point of view - feeling that in the past they were simply presumed to have the same stance as other families in the massacre.

'We're very frustrated mainly because the 26 families got lumped together. We're 26 families made of individuals that all have different opinions,' Hannah D'Avino told the Republican-American.

'It's like people are speaking for me and speaking for my sister,' she added, 'they don't know her and they don't know us.'

The family then recalled to the paper Thanksgiving 2009 when they took turns firing rounds into a tree on their five acres of land with an AR-15 - the same type of semi-automatic firearm used to kill their beloved Rachel, 20 first-grade students and five other school staffers.

The family takes pride in their marksmanship and record of gun safety, Hannah D'Avino told the paper, adding that Rachel was a good shot herself.

Despite a constant presence of guns in the family's lives, the only gun-related incident they have ever had was Rachel's shooting death, her angry sister noted.

The family is angered by politicians attaching the name of a shooting enthusiast from a family of gun ownership advocates to a bill that, if passed, would restrict gun ownership rights.

They declined a ride 
aboard Air Force One with the president to lobby for gun control, they 
also declined to meet with Vice President Joe Biden when he lobbied in 
the state for tougher restrictions on gun ownership .

Rachel D'Avino would often target shoot in her backyard, her sister says, arguing that attaching her name to gun control legislation is disingenuous.

Hannah D'Avino told the paper members of her family were taught to use firearms at a very young age - being given firearm safety lectures before they were old enough to even clean a gun.

Peter Paradis, Rachel D'Avino's stepfather, has been around firearms his whole life, he told the paper. From pellet guns, to pistols, to assault-style rifles, he knows firearms.

Mr Paradis also staunchly opposes the gun control laws passed in Connecticut in the wake of the Newtown shooting, he told the paper. He also opposes proposed federal gun control laws, instead favoring improved enforcement of laws already passed.

Neither Democrat, nor Republican, Mr 
Paradis says he was honored to meet President Obama - but dislikes how 
the president has 'used the shooting to further his political agenda'.

'I
have to say meeting the president was an honor. He's a very 
compassionate man, very genuine,' said Mr Paradis. 'What I don't 
appreciate is the politics. He used (the shooting) for his agenda. Our 
governor did the same thing. That's totally wrong.'

He also pointed out that media portrayals of Mr Lanza 
charging into the school with an assault rife were inaccurate, and only 
fed into the anti-gun political machine.

'The
shooter in Newtown didn't use an assault rifle, he used an 
assault-style rifle,' Mr Paradis told the paper. 'It's much different. 
He could have used a much larger caliber, the same semi-automatic stuff 
and he could have done a lot more damage.'

The dead woman's step-father also argued that treating mental illness would be more effective than controlling guns and tried to make this argument with other Sandy Hook victim families. He said they were shut out of future Sandy Hook Promise meetings as a result.

'It's not the gun that killed the kids,' Mr Paradis told the paper, 'it's the mental illness... it's a lot easier to take and ram through gun control because it doesn't cost anything to ban it.'
