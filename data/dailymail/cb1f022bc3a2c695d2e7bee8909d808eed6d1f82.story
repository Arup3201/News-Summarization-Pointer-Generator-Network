Corrupt? Judge Michael Thornsbury was indicted Thursday for conspiring to imprison the husband of his married mistress after she broke-up with him

A judge in West Virginia was indicted Thursday for conspiring to imprison an innocent man - the husband of his former lover.

Michael Thornsbury, 57, has been the sole circuit court judge in Mingo County, West Virginia since 1997.

He was accused Thursday of attempting several times to get his lover's husband arrested and imprisoned after the two broke up. According to the indictment me attempted to frame the man for drug possession, larceny and assault.Â 

Now suspended from his position without pay, Thornsbury faces 20 years in jail if convicted as well as an expected civil case

Thornsbury
started dating his longtime secretary Kim Woodruff in early 2008, but 
she ended the relationship in June 2008 because she was married.

A scorned Thornsbury allegedly attempted to get her back by putting her husband, Robert Woodruff, behind bars.

According to the indictment, Thornsbury first tried to get Woodruff arrested for drug possession. He
asked his friend Jeff Cline to plan drugs underneath Woodruff's pick-up
truck and then made plans to alert police so they could conduct a 
search. But at the last minute Cline backed out.

Next, prosecutors say Thornsbury tried to get a police officer to accuse Woodruff of stealing scrap metal from his employer. Woodruff
worked at a coal processing facility and his bosses allowed him to take
any scrap metal that had fallen in with the coal.

When
Thornsbury found out about this, he convinced State Police Trooper 
Brandon Moore to file a criminal complaint against Woodruff, accusing 
him of stealing. Moore, a former 
'Trooper of the Year', resisted at first since he knew that Woodruff's 
bosses allowed him to take the metal, but filed the complaint anyway.
Woodruff was arrested for grand larceny in December 2008, but the case 
was dismissed when the county prosecutor disqualified himself from the 
case.

Prosecutors
say Thornsbury even appointed his business partner Jarrod Fletcher 
(Mingo County's director of homeland security and emergency management) 
to head a grand jury on Woodruff.

Apparently
the two conspired to write subpoenaes requesting documents on Woodruff
from all his employers, which Fletcher would sign off on.

Most of the businesses complied but one business requested more time. When
Thornsbury denied that request, the company started a legal battle that
eventually revealed the relationship between the judge and the head of 
the grand jury.

Thornsbury
was tireless. Last year, Woodruff was beaten up and threatened with a 
gun by two men at a convenience store. The two aggressors were arrested 
and charged with assault.

But
then a month later the charges against the aggressors were mysteriously
dismissed and instead Woodruff was charged with assault and battery.

Thornsbury
allegedly tried to use his clout as circuit court judge to sway the 
county prosecutor in pushing for the maximum six-month sentence.

Stripped of his position: Thornsbury has been suspended without pay and his law license has also been suspended in light of the indictment

Prosecutors say that would have been 'an extraordinarily harsh punishment even if (Woodruff) had been guilty.'

Woodruff
refused to take the six-month plea deal and eventually that case too 
was dismissed because the prosecution didn't think it was in the 
interest of justice.

The Woodruff's lawyer Mike Callaghan said the couple plan to sue.

Thornsbury was indicted in court Thursday and released on $10,000 bond. While leaving the court he seemed confident he would win his defense.

'The truth will be told and I will be acquitted,' he said.

Thornsbury has been suspended without pay. He has also had his legal license suspended.
