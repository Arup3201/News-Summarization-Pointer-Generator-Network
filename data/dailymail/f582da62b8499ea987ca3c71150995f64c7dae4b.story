She used to be the neighbour that families would often see out on her evening walk, strolling around the community with a friendly smile and a cheery wave for everybody.

Now, after landing a share of one of the biggest lottery pots in history, Ira Curry has become something of a recluse, forced to sneak in and out of her suburban Atlanta home in disguise and avoiding all contact with the outside world.

Curry’s neighbours in the picturesque town of Stone Mountain have seen her only once since Tuesday night’s Mega Millions drawing, in which the 56-year-old grandmother scooped a half-share of the $636 million jackpot and the biggest prize ever in Georgia. After taxes, she walked away with a $120 million lump sum.

Winner! Ira Curry, from Stone Mountain, Georgia, scooped $120million and has been described as a 'humble' grandmother who loves playing with her grandchildren

Not short of friends: Neighbor Ravonia Cole paid tribute to the Currys, who neighbors said enjoyed a happy home life and loved to travel 

Wearing a large hat pulled down over 
her face and a collar turned up, a woman who looked like Curry drew up 
to the two-storey house in a car driven by a younger woman, thought to 
be her 36-year-old daughter Nishona, and dashed in to collect some 
personal belongings.

They 
did not speak to reporters waiting outside and raced off into hiding, 
abandoning Curry’s own silver Mercedes sports coupe on her driveway and 
ignoring the numerous flowers, Christmas poinsettias, chocolates and 
other gifts from well-wishers piling up on the doorstep.

“If
 it was me, I’d be gone too,” said Francis Boudreaux, a neighbour across
 the street who said he used to wave at Curry’s husband Talmer, 74, when
 he put the trash cans out.

“They
 are lovely people, very humble with a good heart, and I hope they use 
the money for good things, and going traveling themselves.”

Next-door
neighbour Quentin Sims said Mrs Curry is a keen gardener who spends weekends
tending pot plants and enjoying time outdoors."They
love to travel, they went to Europe this summer, and I'd imagine they'll go to
many more places with $120 million," he said.

Sims
said he spoke often with the couple about their travels and family life.
"She plays with her granddaughters outside all the time when they come
over," he added.

Sims,
who like Mrs Curry works in the insurance industry, said he expected to hear
from her over Christmas.

Joy: Mrs Curry, who is married with children, only thought to check the numbers when she heard about the win on the radio this morning. She was driving and called her daughter to check

"She's
taking some time away to get her head around this and try to come to terms with
it," he said. "I'm sure she'll call when she's ready."

Even before their big win, life 
for the Currys, who married in 2009, was already pretty comfortable. Mrs
 Curry, who according to lottery officials used a combination of family 
birthdays and her lucky number 7 for her “last minute” purchase of the 
winning ticket, was a vice president and senior property underwriter at 
the Atlanta office of the Aspen Insurance company. She commuted the 24 
miles from home into the city daily in her new Mercedes.

Colleagues
 at Aspen, speaking anonymously because the company did not want 
employees talking to reporters, described her as a hard-working but warm
 boss, who often worked late hours in the office.

“We’ll
 miss her but are delighted for her,” said one, echoing the sentiments 
of a corporate press release from Aspen headquarters.

On
 Friday, the Currys’ house in Scenic View Lane showed few signs of life.
 The heating had been left on to protect against the winter chills but a
 succession of delivery drivers with packages received no answer when 
they rang the bell.

A 
newspaper from Thursday, with the headline: “Georgia woman claims $324 
million” lay untouched on the ground. About a dozen letters from 
financial advisers offering their services were on the doormat, 
alongside a script and letter from a company called Bobcat Films 
inviting Mrs Curry to invest some of her newfound wealth into its 
upcoming movie about Miley Cyrus, billed as “a romantic comedy with a 
spiritual twist.”  

Other neighbours said the Currys were private people who were always pleasant but rarely saw or spoke to them.

“It’s
 wonderful that the winner was somebody who is such a lovely lady,” said
 Revonia Cole, 62, who has lived two doors away from the Currys for the 
last five years. “I’d see her out walking for exercise and she would 
wave, but that’s the only time I saw her.”

Mrs
 Cole said she also bought a ticket for Tuesday’s draw and picked two of
 the winning numbers, 17 and 20. “It gave me a chill when I found out a 
neighbour had won,” she said. “It’s shows that the lottery is for real. 
I’m going to keep playing, the numbers don’t know where you live.”

Kenneth
 Ladler said he knew little about the family, despite living right next 
door. He said family members, including Mrs Curry’s daughters and 
grandchildren, would visit, but that the couple was very private.

None of the neighbours were aware that the Currys had filed a 1994 bankruptcy, which was discharged five years later.

Nobody
 was home at Nishona Curry’s apartment 10 miles away in Decatur, and two
 other daughters who live in The Bronx, New York, have not been seen 
since Wednesday.
