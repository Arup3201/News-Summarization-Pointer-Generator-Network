An HIV-positive soldier who was forced to wear a surgical mask in court to prevent him from trying to infect others was today found guilty of involvement in a plot to blow up a Texas restaurant full of soldiers.

Jurors in the U.S. District Court in Waco deliberated for around an hour before finding Naser Jason Abdo guilty of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction, attempted murder of U.S. officers or employees, and four counts of possessing a weapon in furtherance of a federal crime of violence.

Abdo, 22, did not stand with his attorneys when jurors and the judge entered the room, and showed no emotion when each of the six 'guilty' verdicts was read by the court clerk.

He faces up to life in prison. His sentencing was set for July.

Earlier Private First Class Abdo was flanked by courtroom security who wore protective glasses after an incident in which the soldier bit his lip and spat blood at police.

He is believed to have been in contact with the influential U.S born cleric Anwar al-Awlaqi who was killed in a drone strike last year.

Prosecutors called the first of 43 witnesses to the stand in a bid to demonstrate that Abdo, who went AWOL from his post at Fort Campbell in Kentucky to allegedly construct his bomb and gather weapons did intend to kill troops last summer.

Opening statements began on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Waco, about 50 miles northeast of Killeen. Abdo is not being tried in a military court.

His lead defense attorney, Zachary Boyd, referred to the mask while questioning potential jurors on Monday.

'I have a concern. My client looks a little different today because he has a mask on,' said Boyd then asking if they had a problem with Abdo's mask. Nobody raised a hand.

The soldier has been accused of biting through his lip and spitting blood on a deputy U.S. marshal and a sheriff's deputy who were escorting him after a court hearing last month.

Officials reported a previous blood-spitting incident on a jailer.

McLennan County Sheriff Larry Lynch said he couldn't comment on why Abdo was wearing a mask in court, and a gag order prevents attorneys from discussing anything about the case publicly.

Boyd also asked potential jurors if they would 'hold it against my client for being a Muslim,' and no hands were raised.

Killeen police began investigating Abdo after an employee from Guns Galore, in Dallas called July 26, saying a young man bought six pounds of smokeless gunpowder, shotgun ammunition and a magazine for a semiautomatic pistol – while seeming to know little about his purchases, according to previous court testimony and documents.

Officers also learned that he bought a U.S. Army uniform and a 'Smith' name patch from another store but didn't know his unit, according to testimony.

After officers tracked Abdo to a motel near one of the Army post's gates, they detained him July 27.

Authorities who searched his backpack and motel room say they found a handgun, ingredients for an explosive device and an article titled, 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom.'

An article with that title appears in an al-Qaida magazine published by Anwar al-Awlaqi.

'I was planning an attack here in the Fort Hood community because I don't appreciate what my unit did in Afghanistan,' he can be heard telling a detective in a patrol car recording, played at a court hearing last month.

Abdo told authorities he planned to make two bombs and detonate them in a restaurant frequented by Fort Hood soldiers, according to documents in the case.

While jailed in Waco last fall, Abdo told a Nashville television station that he originally planned to kidnap and videotape the 'execution' of a high-ranking Fort Campbell official 'who participated in the Afghan mission' – but fled after military police learned he was visiting nearby gun stores.

He went AWOL from the Kentucky Army post over the Fourth of July weekend, about two months after he was charged with possessing child pornography, which put his conscientious objector status on hold.

Abdo was absent-without-leave from Fort Campbell, Kentucky when he was arrested in Killeen.

He told investigators he went to Texas to 'martyr himself' for the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, said FBI special agent C. Michael Owens, the first prosecution witness.

Owens testified that Abdo told investigators he planned to put a bomb in what looked like a gift box, leave it a Chinese buffet frequented by Fort Hood soldiers, wait outside and shoot any survivors.

Owens testified earlier that Abdo said he had planned to offer a Fort Campbell soldier a ride, kill him and videotape it while reciting the names of people he felt had been wronged by the U.S. military — including Abeer Qassim al-Janabi, a 14-year-old Iraqi girl who was raped before she and her family were killed in 2006.

Five current or former U.S. soldiers went to prison, one for a life term, for their roles in that attack.

Speaking in court, defence attorney Boyb implored the court to understand that they could not prove that his client intended to kill not was any explosive device constructed.

Greg Ebert called the police to report a suspicious transaction with Pfc. Naser Abdo, an AWOL soldier who was later arrested with bomb making materials in his nearby motel room for a planned attack on Fort Hood soldiers

'I want the jury to focus not just on the evidence,but the law,' said Boyd.

Abdo, who was born in Texas and grew up in a Dallas suburb, became a Muslim when he was 17. He enlisted in the military in 2009, thinking that the service wouldn't conflict with his religious beliefs.

But according to his essay that was part of his conscientious objector status application, Abdo reconsidered as he explored Islam further.

In that essay, which he sent to the Associated Press in 2010, Abdo said acts like the 2009 Fort Hood shootings 'run counter to what I believe in as a Muslim' and were 'an act of aggression by a man and not by Islam.'
