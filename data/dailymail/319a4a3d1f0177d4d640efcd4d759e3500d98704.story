Admission: Director General of the BBC Tony Hall said that staff knew about the doomed IT project but were to afraid to blow the whistle

The BBC’s director general admitted yesterday that his staff knew for years that a £100million IT project was failing but did nothing about it because of a culture at the corporation that prevents whistleblowers from coming forward.

Lord Hall acknowledged a series of recent failures at the corporation, including the costly Digital Media Initiative (DMI) fiasco and the severance payoff scandal.

Saying there was an ‘appalling divide’ between managers and staff, he admitted there was an ‘officer class’ at the top of the BBC and blamed a culture of ‘finger-pointing’ for preventing whistleblowers from raising the alarm when things went wrong.

Lord Hall cancelled the DMI in May, saying it would be ‘throwing good money after bad’ to complete it. Launched in 2008, it was meant to digitise all BBC production but rapidly ran over budget and beyond deadlines.

Speaking at the Edinburgh Television Festival he said: ‘What worries me most about DMI is the fact we went round the place and people said, “Yeah, we knew about that” but no one said. That’s the problem of a culture where fingers are pointed, blame is appointed – people don’t feel they can own up and say something is going wrong.

‘I don’t like that sort of culture. I want a culture where people can say, “We can take risks, we can do things which are creatively difficult, organisationally difficult, and we can learn from our mistakes.” ’

Making an unexpected appearance in Edinburgh, Lord Hall was also forced answer questions about the payoff scandal, following last month’s disclosure that the BBC handed departing staff £300million over eight years.

The Digital Media Initiative (DMI) was meant to allow BBC staff to access everything in the archive from their computers, doing away with the need for video or audio tapes

One of his chief inquisitors was former BBC journalist Liz MacKean, who left the corporation after the Jimmy Savile scandal last year. She was one of two reporters to work on a Newsnight expose of the predatory DJ that was scrapped by news executives in 2010.

Miss MacKean criticised the director general’s response to the crisis, saying: ‘The whole issue of severance payments gets to the heart of something that has been badly wrong with the BBC for decades, which is the creation of an officer class that seems to fly in the face of the principles of public service broadcasting.

Gary Lineker  says he doesn’t deserve his £1.5million BBC pay deal.

The England striker-turned-TV pundit said: ‘If you are at the top in entertainment you earn money that you can never justify to ordinary people doing proper jobs.

‘You can’t. I’m not even going to try. Do I deserve it? Probably not – but who would turn it down?’

Although Lineker has never publicly disclosed his Match of the Day salary, he is believed to have earned £2million before taking a £500,000 pay cut earlier this year.

But the 52-year-old presenter – who also has lucrative contracts with Arabic network Al Jazeera and Walkers Crisps – insisted he would be able to rake in even more money if he worked for a different channel.

‘That is the downside of working for the BBC,’ he said.

‘I could earn more elsewhere, but because it’s the licence fee you are open to criticism.’

‘The corporation has been treated as a get-rich scheme where the people at the top reward the outgoing people at the top even if they have got new jobs to go to, even if they have been given more than a year’s notice of their departure.’

Lord Hall admitted the debacle had been ‘terrible for morale’ within the BBC and agreed there had been an ‘officer class’ at the top of the corporation. He said he wanted to ‘heal this appalling divide’.

Miss MacKean criticised the BBC’s leadership for failing to punish executives over the Savile scandal. ‘It doesn’t seem anyone has taken responsibility for it,’ she said. ‘How can people learn if mistakes aren’t admitted?’
