A mother-of-four who vanished soon after coming home from a Halloween party was today revealed to have filed for divorce just three weeks ago.

Karen Swift, 44, was reported missing by friends after she was last seen by  her husband at home in Dyersburg, Tennessee, early Sunday morning.

Police are now frantically searching for Mrs Swift, after her Nissan car was found abandoned less than a mile away from their home with a flat tyre.

Missing: Karen Johnson Swift, 44, of Dyersburg, Tennessee, has not been seen since she left a Halloween party over the weekend

Her husband David, whom she was divorcing, told police he last saw his wife at home after she 
returned from the party to drop off their children.

Mr Swift said they spoke briefly 
before he went to bed, but he has not talked to reporters about his 
wife. She filed for divorce on October 11.

Mrs Swift's 2004 Nissan Murano was found 
abandoned on the side of a road near her home with a flat tyre, reported
the Dyersburg State Gazette.

Her father Gary Johnson, 67, told ABC she could have got a flat tyre and decided to leave the car and walk home when something happened to her.

‘I think the most major thing is to 
look at is the last known location where we knew she was,’ Dyer County 
Sheriff Jeff Box told WREG.

She has two sons in college and two daughters aged seven and nine. The youngest girl 'just cries' and will 'hardly eat' now, Mr Johnson told ABC.

Her cell phone is also missing. 
Police said it was last used at about 5am on Sunday when Mrs Swift 
accessed the internet on the device.

Cops are working with the phone 
company to pinpoint its last location. Her husband has not been 
named as a suspect in the case.

And the couple's 21-year-old son Preston said he has never seen them being violent towards each other, reported WPSD.

On Tuesday, authorities searched the area by helicopter and on the ground for any clues as to what may have happened to her.

There are no signs of foul play and her disappearance is being treated as a missing persons case, Sheriff Box told KAIT.

Other case: Mrs Swift's home is not far from where Holly Bobo was abducted

Janet Ross, a longtime friend of Swift, told KAIT: 'It's like living in a nightmare that you can't wake up from.'

'Karen lives for her children. They were her world. She would not do this to them, if she could prevent it.'

Tennessee investigators are also doing a forensic analysis on the car of 5’5” Mrs Swift, who has 
blonde hair and green eyes.

In addition, her home in Dyersburg is just 80 miles away from where 21-year-old nursing student Holly Bobo was abducted in Darden in April.

Six months after that disappeareance, her family are continuing their own searches and investigators are developing leads and working on the case daily.
