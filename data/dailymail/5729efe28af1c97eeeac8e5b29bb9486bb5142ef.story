For many people New York’s iconic skyscrapers are a part of the city's charms.

But if you’ve ever fancied seeing them change colour- there’s an app for that.

The app, called Spireworks will allow people to control the lights at the top of two midtown skyscrapers 1 Bryant Park and 4 Times Square.

App: Spireworks is the only building scale interactive lighting installation in New York City where you can use your mobile phone to sign in and control the spire lights

Changing lights: Those who use the mobile phone app will be able to change the lights at the top of two midtown skyscrapers 1 Bryant Park, left, and 4 Times Square, right,

Mobile 
phone users will be able to use the app to add sparkles or pulses of 
light to the buildings or change the lights on the spire and even the 
antennae, according to the New York Daily News.

The app was created by Mark Domino, the son-in-law of Douglas Durst, a Manhattan-based real estate investor and developer.

But
 it's not an entirely new idea. For many years the Empire State Building
 has changed lights during holidays like Memorial Day and campaigns.

There is even a 'lighting calender' page on the website for the Empire State Building.

It shows what colours the building will change to throughout the year.

The popularity behind the iconic skyscraper's lights inspired Domino to pitch an alternative to it that would allow people to adjust the colours on other New York buildings using their mobile phones.

However, the project, which is still in 
development, is only open to those who get an invite from one of a 
hundred current users.

It is already being used by a street performer in Times Square as part of his act after he got an invite from a former Bank of America executive.

Domino describes the project as a democratic and philanthropic call to action on the New York City skyline.

At present an average of five New Yorkers play with the lights every night.
