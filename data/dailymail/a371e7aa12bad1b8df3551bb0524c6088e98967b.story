Gamers can recreate the classic Game Boy console along with 13 original games thanks to a website

With it's big red buttons, green screen, and dodgy sound effects, the original Game Boy is part of retro gaming history. 

But now nostalgic fans can now replicate the classic console on their smartphones thanks to a website.

The Game Boy emulator recreates the handset on users' screens and allows them to play 13 games including Mario Land, Tetris and Space Invaders.

Simply open the page on an Android or iPhone device in order to play.

All the game requires is a touchscreen in order to use the buttons, which means it cannot be played on a PC.

Created by Ben Midi it uses the same controls as the original console, but adapted for use on a smartphone touchscreen.

Available for Android or iPhone handsets, it can be played in either portrait or landscape mode, allowing gamers more room to use the buttons.

It is not known if Nintendo is aware of the website.

However other retro game emulators are popular online, with Android users able to buy apps which replicate the Atari, the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Game Boy Advance.

The Game Boy was released in 1989 in America and Japan and was immensely popular, selling 87million units worldwide.

On its release in the United States the entire first shipment, containing millions of units, sold out within weeks of arriving.

Modern-day iPhones have roughly 650 times the processing power of the first Game Boy to be released.
