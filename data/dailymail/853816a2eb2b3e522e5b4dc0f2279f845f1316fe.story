She most recently provoked mothers by saying breastfeeding was 'vile and borderline incest'.

Now NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham, who gave birth to daughter Grace in September, is saying she wants to get pregnant again by Christmas - to save on the school run.

The unemployed wannabe-model, who fell pregnant with her third child after a stint as a £1,000-a-night hooker, wants another child in the same school year as Grace.

She told The Sun: 'After having Grace, I realised I wanted another kid.

'I don't want to spend my whole life doing the school run.

'So now I need to get pregnant by Christmas so both babies are in the same year at school.'

The controversial mother-of-three, from Leeds, who fell last week on a drunken night out in London, doesn't mind if she conceives through a night of casual sex. 

Last month, she looked worse for wear as she enjoyed a night out in London's Soho just weeks after giving birth to her daughter Grace.

Showing off her platinum blonde locks, Josie pole-danced in a nightclub, before flashing her pink bra and falling over several times in the street.

She first made headlines after getting a boob job on the NHS to help her become famous, she reportedly received taxpayer-funded taxi rides worth £6,000 a year - because she's too infamous to use the bus. 

Recently, the 24-year-old deemed breastfeeding 'vile and borderline incest'.

Her comment sparked outrage among mothers who slammed her view as 'disgusting' and 'uneducated'. 

When asked on Twitter whether she would breastfeed her daughter like new mother Kimberly Walsh, she wrote: 'No I'm not! I think the idea is vile and borderline incest!' 

But then she revealed an unusual cash-making venture to sell her breast milk to new mothers for £2 an ounce - and £10 an ounce to men with 'milk fetishes'. 

Her controversial pregnancy also saw her offering tickets to strangers to watch her give birth, and announcing that she would quit smoking and drinking alcohol when she learned she was having a girl.

Before going into labour, she revealed she had been 'fooled' into thinking the father was a Premier League footballer.
