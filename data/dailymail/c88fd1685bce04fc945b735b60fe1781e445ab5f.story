A little boy who has been battling an aggressive form of leukaemia has realised his dream of becoming a policeman for the day - thanks to China's version of Whatsapp.

Liu Zixi, eight, was diagnosed with the deadly disease in July last year, and has since endured nine rounds of painful chemotherapy.

But the little boy has kept his spirits up through three near-death experiences by dreaming of becoming a policeman one day so he can 'catch thieves and arrest baddies', the People's Daily Online reported.

He even begged his father: 'I may die soon, but I am not afraid. Help me realise my dream.' 

Dream: Eight-year-old Liu Zixi dreams of becoming a police officer and 'catching thieves' when he grows up

Determination: But after he was diagnosed with leukaemia, he begged his father to make it happen sooner

Touching: The police commander heard of his wish after word spread through the Chinese WhatsApp

So father Liu Xiaodong decided to make the youngster's dream come true, and began to spread word of his son's plight through WeChat - the Chinese WhatsApp.

The story touched the hearts of many in Jilin City, where the family live, and then with thousands across the country.

A total of 12,000 yuan (about £1,307) was donated by well-wishers, and Zixi even got a visit from China's National Women's Speed Skating team members.

But then the tale reached the ears of Jilin Public Security Bureau commander Fu Zhangkun. 

'We are all very moved by his dream of becoming a police officer,' he said. 'It has become a responsibility for us to realise for him.'

So the officers and Zixi's 38-year-old father worked together to surprise the little boy - and make his dream a reality.

Surprise: The officers worked with Zixi's parents on a treat for the boy, who is currently in hospital

Perfect: They had a special uniform made, and created an honorary role for the little boy

Delight: After a special ceremony, Zixi was put in charge of 'protecting the harmony of the hospital'

On Monday, Zixi was visited by a policewoman in his room in the Paediatic Hematology Department of the Number 1 Hospital. 

She then unveiled a uniform, which had been specially made for Zixi, who was about to become the youngest police officer in Jilin.

Zixi was then awarded the title of 'honorary police officer' in a simple ceremony - before Commander Fu sent him off to fulfill his duties 'protecting the harmony of the hospital'.

The entire experience has left Zixi delighted. 

'I am very happy, I didn't know what I had to do but I have realised my dream,' he said, vowing: 'When I have recovered I will catch thieves.'

Future: Zixi is still dreaming of becoming a policeman - saying when he recovers he 'will catch thieves'
