Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has criticised the decision to allow CSKA Moscow fans in to Tuesday night's behind-closed-doors Champions League game in Russia.

Moscow's Khimki Arena was supposed to be empty apart from media, club officials and sponsors guests after UEFA punished CSKA for problems with their supporters in the past.

But City played out a disappointing 2-2 draw against a background of noise and fierce support from about 300 fans in the main stand.

UEFA had ordered the match to be played behind closed doors because of racist behaviour by CSKA fans

Official crowd - 0

Club delegates - 75 per club

Centre circle boys and parents - 50

Media - 150

UEFA partners (sponsors) - 300 

With no City fans present, it made for a peculiar environment and now UEFA are to investigate after suggestions sponsors tickets and media passes were sold to regular fans on the black market.

An angry Kompany said: 'This one really annoys me and maybe it's on top of other things as well.

'You say "No fans" then all of a sudden you turn up and basically the only team that hasn't got fans is Man City.

'So who's getting punished? Who is being done for racism? Man City or Moscow, you know?

'I don't have a problem, they'll say it's sponsors and so on and they need to give certain allocations, but why are we getting punished, you know?

'And again, because you'll have people in your papers writing columns saying 'he should be looking at his own performance and stuff' – so, done – we've analysed it and we know we should have done better and that but things like this are unacceptable to honest, there's just no fairness in it.'

Some of the spectators situated in front of the City officials in the stand appeared to be drunk and spent much of the game standing up with beer glasses singing and chanting.

City were leading 2-0 at half-time but only took a point in the end after a controversial late penalty gave CSKA their first point of the group stages.

'It doesn't have an effect on the players,' added Kompany.

Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany was not afraid to criticise that CSKA fans were allowed in to watch

Kompany questioned who was being punished after CSKA fans appeared to have been allowed in

 'Its just little things when you leave with a result like this.

'Obviously you can't deny there's a bit of frustration, and I'm not looking for an excuse, but if you want to play it fair then, fair enough, you've got to let your sponsors have some tickets but why the hell do we not have any fans here?

'Why? What have our fans done wrong?

'So it needs to be looked at, it needs to be changed, because our fans shouldn't be punished.'

City have made their views known to UEFA and the governing body have promised to look in to the issue.

Officials from UEFA were seen taking photos and videos of the spectators during the second half.

Despite Milner and Aguero's efforts, the game ended 2-2 meaning City have failed to win in Europe this season
