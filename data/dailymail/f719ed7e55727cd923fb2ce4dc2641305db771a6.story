Shameful: The girl knocked the pensioner to the ground after punching and kicking him - and is shown here spitting in his face

It is an English summer evening and an elderly man quietly makes his way along a city centre street.

Until he is confronted by a girl who attacks him, pushing the 80-year-old to the ground.

The unidentified thug spat in his face and left him sprawled on the pavement.

The sickening and unprovoked attack was captured on video by a passer-by using a mobile phone camera and shared on Facebook.

Police are treating the attack as serious malicious wounding, punishable with up to five years in prison.

The footage shows the girl knocking the Asian man to the ground in Coventry city centre last Saturday at 8.30pm. She was flanked by three men as she continued hurling abuse and spitting on the man.

The only person to help, by picking up the victim’s turban, approached as the thugs walked away.

Detectives have urged witnesses to come forward to help catch the girl.

Chief Superintendent Andy Nicholson, said: ‘This is a despicable, violent attack on an elderly man in broad daylight.

‘The victim is an 80-year-old man. He was left with a bloodied nose and a black eye.

A video showing the assault is gathering momentum on social media and quite rightly the woman’s actions are being condemned by everyone who’s viewed it.

Detectives in Coventry are fast-tracking this investigation.

‘We’re doing everything we can to arrest the man’s attacker as soon as possible.

‘I’d encourage the woman to make contact with West Midlands Police as it’s only a matter of time before we catch up with her.’

Disgusting: The young bully went for the 80-year-old and then left as he fell backwards, hard onto the pavement

Vicious: We have preserved the man's dignity here as he has lost his blue turban, and helps himself to his feet

The video has sparked outrage on Facebook and Twitter.

Harmony Lully said: ‘I actually feel physically sick, wish I never watched this now.

‘I can’t believe anyone would ever 
have the audacity to do such a horrible thing, especially in my own 
city! And shame on the people who stood and watched/filmed her and 
didn’t have the decency to stop her. I hope justice will be served.’

Amadine Ambrico wrote: ‘See this is what the world is coming to,  unbelievable.

‘If that was my daughter I would drag her to the police station and let her face up to this disgraceful act.’

Ajay Singh wrote: ‘The Sikh turban is 
not just a piece of cloth ... It gives us a sense of responsibility ... 
Most of all, it gives us the values passed on to us by our holy book – 
and that includes standing up for the weak and vulnerable.’'
