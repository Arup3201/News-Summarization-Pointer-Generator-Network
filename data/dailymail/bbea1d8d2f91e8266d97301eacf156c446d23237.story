Sky News presenter Kay Burley has been branded 'insensitive bordering on cruel' by Twitter users after she broke the news of April Jones' alleged murder to volunteers on live television.

Mark Bridger, 46, was arrested on suspicion of the murder of April Jones this morning suggesting detectives are now looking for the five-year-old's body.

The development was announced to the media at a police press conference shortly after 10.30am.

But as the news broke Burley, 51, who has been reporting from Machynlleth since April was reported missing, asked two members of the community for their reaction.

The interviewees - believed to be volunteers searching for April - said they hadn't
heard any updates so Burley chose to break the news to them live on air.

With her back to the camera, Burley said: 'They [the police] don't expect to find her alive.

'I'm sorry to have to tell you in circumstances like this... would you 
like to say anything?'

One woman is then seen on camera crying and gasping, putting her hand over her mouth.

The controversial interview, watched by 
thousands of people across the country, sparked an immediate Twitter storm with 
users questioning the presenter's judgement.

It also raises questions over the ethics of rolling live news coverage of such news stories.

Labour MP Tom Watson called the interview 'insensitive bordering on cruel' on Twitter.

Lauren Laverne tweeted: 'Kay Burley. 
Wow. Just wow', while LilythePurr said: 'Harrowing heartbreaking news 
compounded by unethical journalism. Shame on you Kay Burley.'

Another user said it was: 'The worst kind of television news reporting: cruel and pointless'.

Moments after the interview Burley's 
Wikipedia page was updated with a spoof update.

It reads: 'She also 
works part-time as Death, being the first to announce the demise of 
then-missing child April Jones, her primary source being her own 
testimony.'

A spokesman for Sky News said: 'It is clear from the full clip that Kay did not start the interview with the intention of breaking the sad development to them.

'However, as the interview unfolded, she found herself having to explain the developments and she sought to deal with it as sensitively as possible whilst continuing to offer some comfort to the interviewees.

'Everyone at Sky News has the greatest sympathy for all those affected by this tragic story and we will continue work with the police and local community to keep people informed.'

There has been an out-pouring of upset on Twitter over Kay Burley's interview with users branding it 'cruel and pointless' and 'disgraceful journalism'. Labour MP Tom Watson said it was 'insensitive bordering on cruel' 

In 2010 Burley interviewed Peter Andre just after his ex-wife Katie Price married Alex Reid.

The singer broke down in tears when she probed him on whether he feared losing custody of his children to Reid.

That year she was forced to apologise for offending Catholics when she joked that US Vice President Joe Biden had a 'large bruise' from 'walking into a door' when he had ash on his forehead to mark Ash Wednesday.

A few months later she raised eyebrows when she interrupted Labour MP Chris Bryant talking about the News of the World's phone hacking scandal with the words: 'No, no, no, you can't say that, sir... No, no, 
no, no, I have to interrupt you, do you have evidence for that?... 
Pretty strong claim if you don't!'

Bryant said evidence for his statement was included in a parliamentary debate covered by her programme and accused her of being 'dim'.

Twice-divorced Burley, from Wigan, Lancashire, joined Sky Television, launching the Sky One Entertainment Channel in November 1988 with her own documentary 'The Satellite Revolution'.

The mother-of-one then moved to the then fledgling Sky News, where she has remained ever since.

She now presents the 2pm until 5pm strand between Tuesday and Friday.

It's not the first time Burley has 
hit the headlines for her interviewing style.

In 2010 Peter Andre broke 
down in tears in a live interview when quizzed about Katie Price's new husband Alex Reid, who she has since divorced. 

The Australian singer was overcome 
with emotion when probed by Burley about the role the cage-fighter would
play in his children's lives.

April has been missing since Monday 
evening when she was seen seen getting into a car a few yards from her 
home, where she lived with mother Coral, 40, father Paul, 43, sister 
Jasmine, 16, and younger brother.

Bridger was arrested on suspicion of 
abduction on Tuesday and has been questioned by police since. He was 
arrested on suspicion of murder today.

April's disappearance has prompted one of the biggest police investigations of its kind.

Despite emotional and high-profile pleas for her safe return, no trace of the youngster has been found.
