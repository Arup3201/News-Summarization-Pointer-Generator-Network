Three Islamic fanatics discussed a bizarre plot to kill people with a giant blade attached to a monster truck dubbed the ‘Ultimate Mowing Machine’, a court was told.

The conversation was recorded on a bug planted by MI5, who suspected they were preparing to kill themselves in a suicide bombing plot.

Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid, 27, and Ashik Ali, 27, are accused of plotting an attack that would wreak more carnage that the atrocities of July 7, 2005.

The Birmingham-based trio were caught on tape considering a terrorist attack which features in a banned Al Qaeda internet propaganda magazine called Inspire.

In the tape recordings of bugged conversations alleged gang leader Irfan Naseer, 31, is heard saying: 'I feel like I've been driving a monster truck, you know.'

His alleged accomplice, Irfan Khalid, 27, replies: 'Yeah, put blades on the front and trample on everyone.'

Khalid tells co-defendants Naseer and Ashik Ali that if they did that they would not get shot for a long time, the court heard.

Asked why, Khalid said: 'You know what they said, the brothers in the magazine, they said stick thingy on... at the front, like you know, erm, blade... just weld it on and run into people. Just drive into people in a crowded area.'

Woolwich Crown Court was told the gang planned to open an Islamic shop as a cover for their terror activities and said they would turn the street into a 'little war-zone'.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'Khalid and Naseer talked about people "getting killed" in a particular road, and how no-one would come there anymore because it would be a "little war-zone".

'They talked about putting blades on a truck and running into people, an idea that had been published in an outlawed extremist online magazine called Inspire, under the title 'The Ultimate Mowing Machine'."

Their plan was to recruit others and raise cash for their plot to stage a terror attack in Britain which would be more devastating than 7/7, the court heard.

In the dock: The trio were cautioned about the sky-high interest rates on payday loans, but believed they would never have to make repayments, it is alleged

The three men are on trial at Woolwich Crown Court accused of masterminding a terrorist plot.

The trio, from Birmingham, wanted to detonate eight rucksack bombs and timer bombs in crowded areas but police arrested them before they could carry out their ‘bombing campaign,’ a jury has heard.

They are part of a gang of 11 men and one woman who were arrested in September last year.

On the second day of their trial, prosecutor Brian Altman QC said the mindset of the British-born ‘jihadists’ was clear from as far back as 2006.

He told jurors Ashik Ali registered two usernames on eBay using the email address ‘be-terror@yahoo.co.uk.’

'The first user name he registered with eBay bore the name 'terrorshop' and the second he registered as 'shopterror',' Mr Altman said.

'The first of the accounts was suspended for unknown reasons in October 2006. The second account remains active but, like the first, has never been used.

'However, they reveal his mindset even then, even if the usernames he chose were registered half in jest,' he said.

The court heard his co-defendants twice travelled to Pakistan for terror training in the mountainous regions of Pakistan, which are populated with those closely linked to the Taliban.

The first trip in March 2009 lasted eight months. The pair then returned in December 2010 staying for seven months.

While there they learned how to use weapons, explosives and even poisons, it is alleged.

They funded their trips by posing as bogus charity workers for Muslim Aid and ‘beguiling the public’ by wearing the charity’s green T-shirts and merchandise, Mr Altman said.

Out of the £13,500 they fraudulently collected in Birmingham and Leicester only £1,500 was handed to Muslim Aid.

But when the group ‘got a little greedy’ and tried to invest some of the money to get greater returns they ended up losing £9,000, it was said.

They also discussed mass poisoning along with the suggestion of fixing blades to a vehicle and driving it into crowds, the court heard.

Naseer, of Sparkhill, Khalid, of Sparkbrook and Ali, of Balsall Heath, all in Birmingham, deny planning a bombing campaign, recruiting others for the plot and fraudulently collecting money to fund it.

Khalid and Naseer also deny travelling to Pakistan for terror training while Naseer further denies assisting others to travel to Pakistan for terror training.

The trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, continues.
