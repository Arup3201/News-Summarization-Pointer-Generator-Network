Republican Rep. Vance McAllister - aka the kissing Congressman -  won't be on the ballot this fall, but that doesn't mean he won't seek elected office ever again.

'No, I wouldn’t rule it out,' McAllister told Politico on Wednesday.

'I’d just have to see what’s right for me and my family at the time. … For future politics, I don’t know what it holds, but if there’s a possibility that the people want me to do another political office, again, maybe I’ll do it.'

McAllister, a married father of five, was infamously caught on camera kissing his scheduler, who is also married, just months after he was elected.

The Louisiana businessman was swept into office in a special election to replace Rep. Rodney Alexander after the latter left vacatred his seat to go work for Loisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.

Video of the two smooching in McAllister's Louisiana Congressional office created headaches for the Congressman and the aide, Melissia Peacock, after a local news station aired the Congressman's dirty laundry.

McAllister said he now knows the leak came from within and the staffer responsible no longer works for him. He's not telling reporters the person's name, though.

'I don’t want to bring anyone else down,' McAllister told Monroe, Louisiana, news station KTVE/KARD this week.

Local media have speculated the Congressman's Monroe district office director Leah Gordon was the culprit because she submitted her resignation amid the scandal, and McAllister's description of the leaker all but confirmed it was Gordon.

Prior to his affair, McAllister's claim to fame was that he had received the endorsement of Duck Dynasty star Willie Robertson.

When the scandal broke, McAllister says Robertson told him to 'put politics in the back seat and take care of your family first.'

'We’re you’re friends and we still love you,' Robertson reportedly said.

Fellow philandering Louisiana politician David Vitter also stuck by him when things turned south.

'We talked a couple times by phone and through text message and [his 
message] was just support: like, "Keep your head up," "Thinking about 
you and your family,’" "‘I know times are tough," that kind of stuff… that
 this is not the end of the world,' McAllister told Politico.

Other political players were not as kind. Governor Jindal, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and the Louisiana Republican Party vocally called on McAllister to resign.

McAllister told KTVE/KARD that the same Louisiana politicians calling on him to quit never had his back - even before the scandal-'so that's really no big surprise and shocker.'

As for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, McAllister agreed with KTVE/KARD reporter interviewing him that Cantor was 'maybe a little bit' out of line in calling for his resignation.

The two talked in the wake of the scandal soon after McAllister resumed his duties and returned to Washington, D.C., McAllister said. At that meeting  Cantor again called for his resignation, but 'it was more as a friend to friend.'

'There's no ill will between me and Eric,' McAllister said

'It is what it is, and we'll be fine, and we've got a job to do, so we'll move on from there.'

Maybe one day: McAllister has no plans to run for Congress again, but says, 'I¿d never rule anything out, to be honest with you, whether it be the small of volunteer status for a community organization or national politics, who knows?'

Upon returning to D.C. McAllister said he would not step down because he didn't want to leave his district unrepresented in Congress in the interim. He still stands by that decision.

'They didn't elect me to quit,' McAllister said.

A major factor in his refusal to resign is that his wife told him not to, McAllister said. McAllister says his wife Kelly told him he 'wasn't a quitter' and 'that's not what the people want.' She understands the importance of his work, he said, 'And that's what it's all about.''It's not about this glitz and glamour, and showing up to this event and being in the newspaper, which Lord knows I've had my fair share of that lately,' he said.

If McAllister ever did run for office again, it probably wouldn't be Congress. It would be 'something more local, or maybe statewide to be able to help Louisiana,' he said.

'I’d never
 rule anything out, to be honest with you, whether it be the small of 
volunteer status for a community organization or national politics, who 
knows?' he added.

The filing deadline for McAllister's congressional race is not until August. He could still change his mind about quitting his re-election race, too. But McAllister says a political campaign is not in the cards at this time.

'For this race, I’m not a candidate,' McAllister told Politico.

'I have to think of my family.'
