Andy Murray has revealed that he was unhappy at Alex Salmond's stunt of raising a large Scottish flag in Wimbledon's Royal Box last year immediately after his historic triumph.

Murray dropped an interesting hint about where he stands on the British-Scottish question when asked if he had met Scotland's First Minister.

Not keen: Murray has revealed he 'didn't like' Salmond raising the flag but was nervous about expressing a view on Scottish independence

'He seemed perfectly nice to me but I didn't like it when he got the Saltire flag up at Wimbledon,' Murray told the Sunday Times magazine in an interview promoting his appearance at this week's. Aegon Championships.

'I started competing for Great Britain when I was eleven, a lot of people forget that.'

Although he has a keen interest in current affairs Murray has generally been keen to stay neutral about national identity matters in the year of the referendum, aware of the hot water it could land him in with either side.

However it appears the 27 year-old, who has long lived in the London area with his English girlfriend, would not automatically compete for Scotland in the event the SNP manage to break up the United Kingdom.

Asked who he would play for in that eventuality he responded: 'I don't even know'.
