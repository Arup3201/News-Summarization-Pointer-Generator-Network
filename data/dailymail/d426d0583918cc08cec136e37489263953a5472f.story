Former Juventus head coach Antonio Conte has vowed to turn Italy back into one of the top national sides.

He replaces Cesare Prandelli, who resigned immediately after Italy's early elimination from the World Cup in Brazil.

The 45-year-old agreed a two-year contract, signing it on Tuesday, at the start of his first press conference.

'I am excited and very proud to represent Italy,' Conte said. 'I realise I join the national team at a delicate time after a negative experience at the World Cup, but I am convinced that Italy will rise again.

'Italy have won four World Cups and need to return to the place where they belong.

'I live to win and I search for wins, I am here to bring that mentality. I hope I will lose very little with the national team.' 

Conte quit Juventus last month, shortly after steering the club to a third successive Serie A title.

'The difference between victory and defeat is for me the same as between life and death,' he added.
