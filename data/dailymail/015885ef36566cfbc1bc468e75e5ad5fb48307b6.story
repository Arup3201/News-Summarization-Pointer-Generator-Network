A Thai photographer has created a series of phenomenal portraits of Siamese fighting fish.

The intimate photos are perfectly lit in clear water and look as if the fish are floating in mid air.

Visarute Angkatavanich who originally studied advertising before embarking on a career as a commercial photographer, says that photographing fish is his true 'passion.'

'When I was young, my father gave me some goldfish, guppy and Siamese fighting fish.

'A few years ago I went to pet market and saw so many bettafish mutants from those I saw when I was young. Those are my inspiration for this photo set.'

Aggression: The name suggests that this fish is an aggressive species, but the friction usually only occurs when two males are together

Stunning: The intimate photos are perfectly lit in clear water and look as if the fish are floating in mid-air

The brilliant coloration, and long flowing fins of Siamese fighting fish  make it one of the most well-known aquarium fish.

They have been line 
bred for over 120 years in Thailand and Cambodia to achieve today’s 
stunning colours and long finage.

A long history of captive breeding has changed the shape of the species and today virtually all species for sale are captive-bred.
