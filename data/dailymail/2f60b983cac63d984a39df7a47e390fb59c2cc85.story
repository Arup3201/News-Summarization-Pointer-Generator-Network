Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has picked up a fair number of 'haters' en route to being one of the best managers in football.

Pep Guardiola, Arsene Wenger, Iker Casillas and Cristiano Ronaldo all fall into the category of fellow professionals of the game that have had a public spat or falling out with the man.

But it seems the Portuguese maestro also upsets people outside of football after movie star Viggo Mortensen revealed he is far from a fan.

Mortensen, who is also known as the great nemesis of dark lord Sauron in Lord of the Rings, supports Real Madrid and has spoken of his disdain for the 52-year-old.

He told Grantland: 'There's a real character whom I loathe but find entertaining and that's Jose Mourinho.

'I like Real Madrid, and when Mourinho coached them he basically destroyed the team psychologically. The damage he did to the fan base and the whole structure of the club will last for a while.'
