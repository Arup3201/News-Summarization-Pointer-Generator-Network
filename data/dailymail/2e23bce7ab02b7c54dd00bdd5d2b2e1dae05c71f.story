Despite a summer of football shocks that have included Brazil being humiliated 7-1 by Germany in their own back yard and Bojan Krkic moving from Barcelona to Stoke, BBC pundit Robbie Savage has still managed to cause the greatest surprise.

The former Manchester United and Leicester midfielder, famed for his flowing blond locks, has finally decided to bring his barnet up to date by trading in his ponytail for a neat short, back and sides - before bravely posting an image on his Twitter account.

The 40-year-old claims he decided on the change after arriving at the airport ahead of the World Cup with his wife's passport... because they both shared the same hairstyle in their pictures.

Speaking to The Mirror, Savage said: 'I turn 40 in October, and although age is only a number, there comes a time when you have to grow old gracefully.

'I’ve left the 1980s and 1990s behind, and finally I’ve caught up with the modern world - and I feel liberated. It’s literally a big weight off my shoulders!'

Savage will be a pundit on Match of the Day this season, which prompted the long awaited style makeover.

'If I’m going to be a serious pundit on Match of the Day and working for BT Sport this season, it’s probably the right time to present a serious image,' he said.

'I know I’m going to get battered on Twitter, and merciless stick from mates in the neighbourhood like Freddie Flintoff, but my hair straighteners have had their day.'
