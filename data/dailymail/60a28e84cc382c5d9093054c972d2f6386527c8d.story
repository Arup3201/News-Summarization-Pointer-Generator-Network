Sampdoria striker Stefano Okaka looks set to leave the club after his agent Andrea Cattoli revealed the 25-year-old will be moving to 'a big team' in the summer.

Okaka, a product of the Roma youth product, was linked with a move to AC Milan earlier in the January transfer window after the player was from first team training.

The striker has had a brief spell in the Premier League when he was on loan at Fulham in 2011 when he scored two goals in his six month stay.

Agent Cattoli confirmed the link when interviewed by Italian publication Tuttosport and revealed the striker, who has scored three goals this season, is likely to leave the club.

'In the summer I'm hoping to bring Stefano to a big team,' Cattoli admitted.

'He was already in the eyes of other teams now, including Milan, but the operation was tied to the departure of other players.'

Okaka's agency has also stressed that his client will still give his all for Sampdoria as they chase European football this season.

'Okaka is concentrated only on Sampdoria and his only thought is to play and score for these colours,' said Cattoli.

'He wants to haul the team as high up as he can. He was sought after by many teams during the market window, but his only desire was always to stay under Coach Sinisa Mihajlovic.'
