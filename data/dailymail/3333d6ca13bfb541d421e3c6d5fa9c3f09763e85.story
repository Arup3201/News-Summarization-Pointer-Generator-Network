Road works can frustrate most motorists.

But one village is so incensed by the inconvenience of having their road closed they have allegedly taken to heaping verbal abuse and threats on to the contractors trying to improve their street.

The residents of genteel village Chestfield, in Kent, have screamed, sworn and challenged workers to fights, the contractors claim.

Dave Pullen, 47, one of the sub-contractors fitting underground water pipes says wealthy locals have branded him and his co-workers t***s, lazy w****** and a*******s and shrieked at them on 60 different occasions.

'Threatened for doing their job': Dave Pullen says that the villages have hurled abuse at him and his co-workers

Now the sub-contractor says the abuse he and his colleagues have received from villagers in is so awful he is now considering quitting after 27 years on the job.

He said one irate villager, furious about having to drive around the closed road, screamed: 'You should get your f***ing fingers out and do your jobs you a*******s'

Another well-spoken man in his fifties, wearing an 'expensive grey suit,' even challenged Mr Pullen to a fight because he was so angry about the road closure, he says.

But the employees, who work for Clancy Docwra, which are contracted by South East Water to carry out the work, are actually on course to complete the pipe works ahead of schedule.

The father-of-three, who has worked across the UK, now says he would rather work in crime-riddled areas in London, rather than on the leafy streets of Kent.

Chestfield is an exclusive commuter village, just an hour-and-a-half from London, near the north Kent coast, filled with huge detached houses, which sell for up to Â£1 million.

Mr Pullen, who lives in Medway, Kent, 
with his wife Deborah, 44, said: 'I'm no shrinking violet and I've 
worked all over the place, including in Brixton and Peckham, where there
was usually a stabbing every day.

'But I'd rather work there than Chestfield.

Fury: The road closure has prompted a backlash from local residents, the sub-contractors claim

'The abuse has been unbelievable and I have been shocked, not only at the swear words, but at the aggression as well.

'It's not from youngsters either - the worst has come from middle-aged people.

'It is a very wealthy area but that does not stop them. Some of them must be millionaires.

'Some of them seem to think that because they have a bit of money they have a God-given right to treat people like this.

'It has been pretty bad and unrelenting, but it came to a head on Friday when a woman came along and clicked her fingers in front of my face and a man came up and started egging me on to hit him.

'They know we can't do anything and can't defend ourselves and just have to take it.

'It was so bad we were at the point of walking off the site. I have never felt like that in 27 years of doing this job.'

Mr
Pullen said the abuse started on the day they set up three weeks ago, 
even though locals had been told well in advance about the work and the 
road closure.

The work, 
which forced the closure of Chestfield Road in the centre of the town, 
is scheduled to be finished on Monday but the company hopes to have the 
work completed by Saturday.

Mr
Pullen says he and his team have been starting work on the site at 
7.30am and carrying on until 8pm or 9pm including at weekends, to get 
the work finished as soon as possible.

Grief: Residents from Chestfield, Kent, have tried to drive through the barriers, the road workers claim

But some residents have accused the workmen of taking too long to complete the works.

One lady demanded the workers finish the updates in just 24 hours to stop her being inconvenienced, Mr Pullen claimed and another neighbour has allegedly been spotted filming the team every time they stop for a break.

There have also been claims from Mr Pullen's company's employers South East Water that drivers have been trying to force their cars through the road works.

Mr Pullen added: 'One woman asked why I couldn't work 24 hours a day to finish faster and another woman took photos of us every time we stopped for a break.

'The residents right by where we are working, where all the noise is, have been fine. It is a few people who live further away who have been the worst.

'They have sworn at us and come out with patronising comments.

'We have been polite and answered their questions. It has been absolutely shocking and all we are trying to do is improve their water supply.

'They have tried to drive their cars down the verge to get by because they don't want to go a longer way round.

'I love my job but for the first time ever I have dreaded going to work.

'In these situations all we can do is appeal to people's better nature, but there are a bunch of people in Chestfield Road who don't appear to have a better nature.

'We are due to finish this job on Monday but, barring bad weather, we should finish on Saturday.

'I can't wait. I am thinking of having a party when I get off this site. I don't want to do another job in Chestfield ever again.'

Mr Pullen is a sub contractor for Clancy Docwra, who have been replacing underground water pipes for South East Water.

The current road works have forced the closer of Chestfield Road and a divert has been put in the place.

Graham Webb, Delivery Manager at South East Water said: 'Since the road closure came in drivers have been trying to force their ways through the barriers.

'This not only puts the lives of our contractors at risk, but also other motorists and pedestrians too.

'On top of this, the gang on site has been subjected to a stream of verbal abuse. This kind of behaviour is disgraceful and wholly unacceptable.

'The construction workers are doing a great job to make sure that people in the area have a constant supply of clean drinking water and they should not have to put up with this.

'The road closure has been agreed with Kent Highway Services.

'I strongly urge motorists and passers-by to please respect the traffic management and follow the diversion signs.

'The short term pain of a road closure will be far outweighed by the benefits that this new pipeline will bring to the area for many years to come.'
