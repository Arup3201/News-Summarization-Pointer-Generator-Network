A mysterious driver was spotted on the road with a cat tied to the front of her car and it wasn't because she was driving a Jaguar.

New Philadelphia, Ohio resident Polly Vandall snapped a photo of the cat perched on the Buick driven by an elderly woman on Monday and posted the photo to her Facebook.

The photograph has since been circulating the internet and causing an outrage among animal lovers who fear the cat may be in danger.

There I was, sitting at a red light, in the middle of town. I look up and see..... Cat. On a leash. Tied to the hood of a car. Driving through town.?#?thisJustHappened?' she wrote with her post to Facebook..

Spotted: Ohio woman Polly Vandall snapped this photograph of a cat tied to an elderly woman's car 

cause for concern: After Polly Vandal posted these photos to her Facebook account the photograph circulated the internet and Ohio police received worried phone calls from people accusing the driver of animal cruelty 

UPI reports that Ohio police are now trying to locate the driver of the car after the photos caused speculation over animal abuse.

'Immediately, I was thinking ‘How in the world did that cat get on there?’' Vandall told Fox.

'I don’t believe she drives around town with a cat on, you know? I thought there’s probably a really good story behind this.'

After vandall posted the photos the New Philadelphia police department started getting worried phone calls.

'There was a lot of outrage that wanted these people hunted down, prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and should never own a pet. It was pretty ugly on that end,' said Police Chief Michael Goodwin.

Goodwin said he had to go to Facebook himself to see what people were calling about.

Consfused: Polly Vandall said she couldn't believe what she was seeing and doesn't want to judge the driver of the car but hopes that the cat is being properly taken care of

What's hoing on here?: Ohio residents are worried for the well being of this cat after it was spotted on the hood of this car on Monday

'It’s definitely strange. Part of my concern was the cat was on a leash and he may have been secured, but if there had been a sudden stop or an impact or something the cat could very easily have fell off the hood of the car and under the wheel of the car,' Goodwin said.

'Twenty-five years here in this city and that’s the first time I have ever seen that. We see a lot of strange things and just when you think you have seen it all, another day rolls by,' the chief added.

The director of the Tuscarawas County Humane Society has also expressed her concern over the images.

'The cat can fall off and be dragged or caught in the tire,' Lewis told Fox.

'If the people are found, I would be very curious as to why the cat would be on the hood and would definitely need some kind of warning,' Lewis said.

Though both police and the humane society director have said they think it may be tough to make a case for animal cruelty.

Vandall says she isn't quite sure what was going on but that she doesn't want to be too quick to judge.

'I feel judging her is not my place, you know? I feel like a cat’s place is not on the hood of a car,' Vandall said.
