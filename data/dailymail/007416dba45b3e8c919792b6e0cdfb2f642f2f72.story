The Swedish royal family didn't let a little rain dampen their parade as they gathered to celebrate Crown Princess Victoria's 37th birthday.

The heavens may have opened but the royal family smiled as they enjoyed a musical show at their summer residence Sollidens Palace, on the island of Oland, Sweden.

The family - and members of the public who had come to wish Victoria a happy birthday - wore their ponchos as they took in a show at the stadium.

When it rains, it pours! (L-R) Princess Madeleine of Sweden, Prince Daniel, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, King Carl Gustav XVI and Queen Silvia, wear their ponchos as the heavens open on Victoria Day

The show must go on: The royal family didn't let the rain ruin their fun as they celebrated Victoria Day celebrations on the Crown Princess's 37th birthday at Borgholm Stadium on Oland's island in Sweden

The birthday girl and heir to the throne then went to greet the gathered well-wishers who gave her flowers and presents.

Before the rain fell, the
 Crown Princess looked smart but summery in a white shift dress with a 
pastel pink cardigan. She was happy to pose for pictures with royal fans
 who clamored to wish her a happy birthday.Â 

While Victoria met her public, her husband Prince Daniel kept their daughter entertained with a bottle of bubbles.

Enjoying the show: The family appeared to be enjoying their celebratory day despite a spot of rain

A right royal day out: Prince Carl Philip and Sofia Hellqvist cheer as they watch the show

The former personal trainer, 40, held
 the stick while his daughter blew bubbles. He then revealed his playful
 side by blowing some himself.

The
 little girl is second in line to the throne thanks to the rules of 
succession being changed to allow a Swedish monarch's first born to rule
 regardless of gender.

This means Crown Princess Victoria will one day inherit the throne and, in turn, her first-born daughter will continue the line of succession.

Still looking glam: Wellwishers who joined in the celebrations show off their dresses under clear ponchos

It's a washout! The rain poured at Victoria Day celebrations on the Crown Princess's 37th birthday at Borgholm Stadium on Oland's island in Sweden

She's only two years old, but Princess Estelle of Sweden already knows how to strike a pose and charm an audience.

The cute princess stole the limelight away from her mother today as the royal family gathered to celebrate Crown Princess Victoria's 37th birthday.

The toddler looked adorable in a floral dress with white tights and shoes and had a pretty bow in her hair. Holding on tightly to her mother and grandmother's hands, she then delighted the gathered crowd when she gave them a beaming smile and clapped her hands together in glee.

Here they come: The little princess held on to her mother and grandmother's hands as they walked out to the courtyard to greet the public

The present Queen Silvia, 70, was of 
course present today to celebrate her daughter's birthday. She wore a 
lemon suit with a white lace coat over the top.

Befitting for a princess, Victoria's birthday is never just a quiet family gathering.

It's
 a national day of celebration named after her - Victoria Day. As part 
of the celebrations, there's a fair, golf tournament and pop concert.

A wave from the birthday girl: Crown Princess Victoria turns 37 today

Gifts galore: The crown princess met the crowd gathered to wish her a happy birthday

Shops adorned with Swedish flags and bunting stay open for longer and people are encouraged to relax and let their hair down.

It's also a day when Sweden's sporting achievements are celebrated and this year their Winter Olympic athletes were honoured.

In
 the Swedish press, the news centred on the fact Sofia Hellqvist would 
be making her royal debut at the event following her engagement to 
Prince Carl Philip.

Having fun: While her mother met the public, Princess Estelle's father, Prince Daniel, kept her entertained with a bottle of bubbles

World of their own: The prince blew some bubbles himself as the pair seemed oblivious to the gathered crowd

Pretty as a princess: The little girl wore a floral pink dress, white tights and shoes and a bow in her hair
