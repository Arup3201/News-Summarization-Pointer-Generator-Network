Wayne Rooney has opted for a trip to Las Vegas as the perfect remedy as he recuperates after England's World Cup humiliation.

The 28-year-old jetted out to America's gambling capital over the weekend and enjoyed a relaxing afternoon at a VIP bungalow in the desirable Encore Beach Club on Monday.

They spent time with friends before the Manchester United striker has to report back to Carrington for pre-season training.

Rooney was heavily criticised for his performances in Brazil but can lay claim to having a hand in both the Three Lions' goals at the tournament.

The striker perfectly found Daniel Sturridge from out wide against Italy and nudged home the equaliser in the eventual defeat to Uruguay.

It will prove to be a big season for the player himself as Louis van Gaal's rein takes hold at Old Trafford.

There are still question marks as to whether he and Robin van Persie can play in the same side, with the new manager highly likely to favour his international captain given a straight choice between the two.
