A 28-year-old medical school student who is auctioning off her virginity on the internet has already received bids as high as $550,000, as she reveals her face in an effort to attract more hefty offers.

The student, who is using the alias 'Elizabeth Raine,' launched her online auction on March 31 and initially hid her face to conceal her identity before later deciding it would help convince skeptical customers.

Just a week before bidding ends on May 7, the current top bid listed on her website is $550,000.Â

Auction: Kern offered up her virginity on a website, where she used the name Elizabeth Raine

Raine claims that while she's doing this for the money primarily, she is also attracted by the adventure, eroticism, scandal and the chance to challenge norms about virginity.

She added that she's been planning the auction for a year and it's transformed her, making her more educated about prostitution, virginity and 'slut-shaming.'

Raine told the Huffington Post she was born in the southwest but spent much of her childhood in Saudi Arabia because of her dad's job in the oil industry.

He mom died when she was 10, which was tragic but the trauma is not the reason she is choosing this path to riches.

She told news website that she's still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments.

Cold feet: Kern pulled out of her online auction on Wednesday, saying she wanted to focus on her studies

'I have a busy life. I am picky and guys were never a priority,' she said.

Raine claims to have bachelor's degrees in both biology and engineering and is currently completing a combined MD/PhD program, but she's concerned her 'business venture' may get her thrown out of college if officials learn she's the 'Med School Virgin.'

'Lawyers have different opinions on whether I'd get kicked out, but one lawyer I trust believes it won't happen,' she said.

She believes that she has thought of all the details and is confident she 'can execute and control' the unique 'transaction,' which will in fact take place in Australia because prostitution is illegal in the U.S.

To be safe, the winner must have no STIs and be willing to wear a condom.

He must also not be drunk or on drugs during the encounter, attempt anal sex or treat her violently.

She, however, told the Huffington Post that she is open to kissing the winning bidder, and believes she could even fall in love with the man who pays the most for her flower.

'I wouldn't rule out love, but it's very unlikely,' Raine said.

Raine said while she likes older guys and tall men, she knows she can't control who wins. But she has ruled out sleeping with a woman, claiming that would be 'out of my comfort zone.'

She also can't guarantee that she'll be any good in the sack.

'There will be a legal contract between us,' she said. '[The winner] may not be happy [with the sex], but he knows what he's paying for.'
