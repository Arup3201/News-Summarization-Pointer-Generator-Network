It could be a scene out of a far-eastern fantasy movie - but this isn't Sapporo, it's Surrey.

These pictures were actually taken at Britiain's biggest bonsai nursery, which is home to over 5,000 of the miniature trees.

This week, the flora turned a dazzling array of golds and reds turning the forest of pint sized trees into a spectrum of living colour.

Fiery: Burning reds and golden oranges have swept across the seven-acre landscape of the bonsai nursery as autumn arrives

Precise pruning: Bonsais can be manipulated into growing in different directions with careful cutting techniques

Solace: While most trees, plants and shrubs in the far eatern tradition serve a purpose such as food or medicine, bonsai are popular for their contemplative effect

It comes as forecasters predict a warm weekend ahead, with the some parts of the country set to enjoy temperatures as high as 23C.

The expertly trained staff at Heron's bonsai nursery prune the delicate 
trees on a daily basis to make sure they retain their beautiful form.

Gardeners at the Lingfield centre tend to the incredible seven and a half acre landscape which is filled by large and small trees, all grown in the bonsai style.

While around half of the trees are planted and cultivated in the UK, others are imported from Japan before being placed among ponds, pathways and benches for visitors to marvel at.

Miniature: Bonsai trees are measured in 'hands', but the idea that they are all tiny is false. Some can grow up to two metres tall

Peter Chan and his wife Dawn began collecting miniature trees in 1986 and have since turned the site into a fully landscaped haven for bonsai fans.

Peter became interested in bonsai in 1967 when he started to grow trees and shrubs in a tiny London flat. He won the first ever RHS Gold Medal for a bonsai garden in 1982, the first time he exhibited his intricate work.

He said: 'Our reputation for high quality trees has always attracted immense interest, especially from powerful people who want calming influence in their lives.

'Many of our trees have been used for film shoots and advertising work.'

Growing name: The Heron nursery is revered among horticulturalists in Britain. Their trees have even been used to shoot tv adverts

Originally grown in the far east, 
bonsais have become a pastime for people all over the world, with 
experts and enthusiasts describing the pint sized plants as 'living, 
breathing art.

If grown in the right conditions and developed in the right way, bonsai trees can live for hundreds of years.

Unlike
many other plants in the far eastern tradition, bonsai is a style of growing plants which does not have any agricultural or medicinal purpose, instead their main use is 
for contemplation.

Bonsai is the reproduction of natural tree forms in miniature. It has been practiced in Japan and China since 706 AD.                Bonsai can be practised with almost any woody-stemmed tree or shrub species that produces branches strong enough to be cultivated and will remain small through pot confinement and pruning.

Although they are miniature replicas, Bonsai trees should not be kept indoors at all times. Like normal growing plants, they need light and moisture.

If cultivated correctly, Bonsai can last for hundreds of years.

Despite the miniature trees' autumnal colours, it seems the weather is set to warm up for the last day of summer tomorrow.

The Met Office has predicted a hot weekend ahead, with temperatures expected to soar to 23C in some parts of Britain.

The mini heatwave, which could see temperatures reach 25C by Monday, is likely to be welcomed by millions of families across the country, who have been arguing about whether they should turn their central heating on even 
though it is only mid-September.

It comes as figures revealed on Wednesday that gas use last Saturday and Sunday surged by 65 per cent compared with the weekend before.

However, sun-seekers should be warned that the high temperatures will be accompanied by cloud, damp and drizzly rain on Saturday, according to forecasters.

Meanwhile, Sunday will see a mix of patchy sun and cloud, with rain spells in North West Scotland.

Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxy said: 'The temperatures are starting to creep 
up and if you catch a sunny spell it should feel quite nice.

'But we are not sure how long the warmer weather will last as there is a cold front coming.'

And, with Autumn only two days away, the bonsai nursery isn't the only place to see a flowering of dazzling colours.

The famous Cambridge University Botanic Gardens has seen the leaves of its plants change from green to yellow, orange and scarlet in the past few days.

Sight-seers have flocked to the gardens to admire the array of colourful plants, which are putting on a spectacular show of golden hues.
