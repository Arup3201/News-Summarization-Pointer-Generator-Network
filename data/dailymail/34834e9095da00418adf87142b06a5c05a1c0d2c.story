A Domino's Pizza manager was struck on the head with a metal bar during a robbery in Arizona that was caught on surveillance camera.

Jody Thompson, the manager, is seen being hit on the back of his head with the bar as the burglar demands all of the money from inside the Phoenix store on Tuesday night.

He survived the blow to his head which left both swelling and a scar, as police have released the footage in an attempt to help find the robbery suspect.

The suspect, who is described as a 5'10' tall black man in his mid 20s, fled the scene after he was given an unknown amount of cash from the register.

The man entered the store on Bethany Home Road and 35th Avenue after 10pm on March 17, while Thompson and another employee were inside, according to Fox 10 Phoenix.

The other employee, who has not been identified, ran out of the store to call police.

In the video, the suspect is seen around 10.30pm demanding Thompson to give him cash. 

They exchange words before the manager points and walks towards the safe.

He is then hit over the head with the metal bar by the man as he is trying to unlock the safe. 

'First thing he says 'give me your money, give me your cash', I told him the safe was time delayed, he says you're lying, I bent down to do it and that is when he popped me on the head,' said Thompson.

The manager offered the suspect cash from inside the registers after the man could not get money out of the safe.

The suspect then dumped the money into a bag before running out of the store. 

Thompson said he was lucky it was just a metal bar that the thief was armed with during the attack and not a gun.

Police are searching for the suspect, who is described as last seen wearing a light blue-hooded sweatshirt, black pants, black Nike shoes and white gloves (above the Domino's Pizza on Bethany Home Road and 35th Avenue where the incident took place)

'Luckily it was just a bar, that was what I was looking for, if it was a gun or not, my heart was racing a million miles an hour.' 

The blow to his head left Thompson suffering from swelling and a scar, and he was taken to hospital where he was treated and released the same night.

He said: 'With all the adrenaline I didn't really feel it, I just felt a whack, but it didn't really hurt. It was like a quick pop, that's when I felt it, lucky I had my hat on it kinda cushioned some of it.'

Police are searching for the suspect, who is described as last seen wearing a light blue-hooded sweatshirt, black pants, black Nike shoes and white gloves, according to ABC15.

Thompson is hoping the suspect is found so that an attack like this one does not happen to anyone else.
