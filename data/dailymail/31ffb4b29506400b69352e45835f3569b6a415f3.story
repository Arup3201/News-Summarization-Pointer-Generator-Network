A startling video has emerged showing an officer putting his hand around a woman's throat then forcing her to the floor at a Massachusetts police station.

The footage, taken in February 2013, was released this week following a $1 million federal lawsuit filed by the woman, Maylene Maldonado, against the Chicopee police officer, Daniel Major.

Major has resigned from the department, WCVB reported.

The footage shows him and two other officers restraining Maldonado, who was arrested for allegedly slapping a police officer after she admitted to drinking and smoking PCP, Mlive reported.

In the video, the then-24-year-old repeatedly tells the officers that her lip ring is giving her pain and asks them to help her remove it. 

Arrest: Maylene Maldonado can be seen screaming as she is taken into custody in February 2013

Attack: One of the officers, Sergeant Daniel Major, then abruptly grabs her neck and holds on

But as she continues to scream, Major suddenly grabs her around the neck and continues to hold on as his fellow officers do nothing. Then they all pull the woman to the ground.

While on the floor, Major shouts: 'Shut the f*** up!' 

Maldonado was charged with resisting arrest and assault and battery on a police officer.

In her lawsuit, which also names the other officers, Maldonado has accused the officers of assault and battery and civil rights violations, and accuses the city of failing to properly train its officers.

She also claims she never received medical treatment for the injuries she allegedly sustained. 

Maldonado, from Springfield, was arrested after her friend's car got stuck in a snowbank in Chicopee and officers, who were called to the area following reports about a man with a knife, saw her running to a nearby gas station and went to check on her.

She admitted to drinking and smoking the hallucinogenic drug PCP and then got into an altercation with police officers when they tried to see her license. 

Holding on: She struggles as Major holds on to her neck - while the other officers stand back and do nothing

'Attack': The officers then push Maldonado to the ground, where Major says: 'Shut the f*** up'

She slapped an officer across the face and apologized, according to the criminal complaint, but was arrested and taken to the police station where the alleged assault unfolded. 

The case has also caused divisions within the department.

Thomas Charette, the acting chief at the time of the 2013 incident, defended Major's actions as appropriate because Maldonado was high on PCP and allegedly spat blood during her arrest.

'Sergeant Major made several attempts to speak softly and calmly with Ms. Maldonado in order to calm her and complete the booking process,' Charette said, according to WHDH.

'However, she was either unwilling or unable to understand simple instructions and kept insisting that Sergeant Major repeat himself.'

An internal police review determined he had 'acted admirably', Mlive reported, and a clerk-magistrate's hearing agreed.

A district court judge  reviewed the recording and he was charged with assault and battery in November 2013.

Major, in court in November 2013, was charged with assault but an internal review found he did nothing wrong, which the current police chief has disputed. Major has since retired but now faces a lawsuit from the woman

But because internal affairs investigation found no wrongdoing, former Chicopee Mayor Michael Bissonette told ABC40 that his hands were tied. 

Despite his predecessor's ruling, the current chief, William Jebb, has said Major did not act appropriately and handed the video over to City Hall officials, Mlive.com reported.

'We want to make it clear, it's a different administration,' Chicopee Police Officer Mike Wilk told ABC. 'Two officers have retired and a lot of people have asked about releasing it. Chief Jebb and (Mayor) Kos want it to be transparent department. That's why we released it today.' 

Charette ultimately retired in July 2014 after Jebb beat him to secure the job of police chief.

Mayor Richard Kos' office said: 'The city takes these allegations very seriously and the Chicopee Law Department will file a timely answer to this lawsuit once served.'
