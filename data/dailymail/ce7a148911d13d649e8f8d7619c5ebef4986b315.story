Manchester City players have been kept busy on their pre-season tour of the United States which officially kicks off in the early hours of Thursday morning against Sporting Kansas City.

The Premier League champions will face the MLS side at their Sporting Park Stadium before coming up against AC Milan, Liverpool and Olympiacos.

Manuel Pellegrini took a strong squad to the United States, including first-team stars Joe Hart, Samir Nasri, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Edin Dzeko.

Strapped up: The forward has played a full part in pre-season after suffering with injuries last season

Taking a tumble: Micah Richards' future at City looks uncertain following the signing of Bacary Sagna

But Sergio Aguero, Martin Demichelis, Pablo Zabaleta, Bacary Sagna and Vincent Kompany are all on holiday following their exploits at international level in the 2014 World Cup.

They were warmly received at an open training session at Sporting Park which took place alongside a meet and greet with fans.

Montenegrin forward Stevan Jovetic played a full part in City's exertions after missing much of last season with injury.

While Micah Richards, who has reportedly asked to be released on loan for the final year of his contract at the club after suitors were put off by City's asking price, was another participant.

City will hope their form picks up after slipping to a 2-0 defeat against Dundee and then only narrowly overcoming Hearts 2-1 in their first two pre-season tests.
