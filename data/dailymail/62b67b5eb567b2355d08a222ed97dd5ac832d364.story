I can remember so clearly visiting the hospital to see Kell Brook the day after that horrific knife attack in Tenerife.

As soon as I walked in I looked into his eyes and I knew exactly what he was thinking - is it all over? The wound was horrific, some 38 staples virtually holding his thigh together. I couldn’t believe it, only weeks before we had been celebrating the biggest moment of his career when he dethroned welterweight sensation Shawn Porter in his back yard to capture the IBF welterweight title.

Suddenly we are sitting there waiting to find out if he would ever be able to enter a ring again. The doctor’s analysis wasn’t great - she said with the right rehab there was a decent chance he could fight again but he would not be able to perform in the same way in and out of the ring. She couldn’t have been more wrong.

Over the last few months Kell Brook has shown the heart of a lion. No one really gets to see the struggle he went through - dressing the wound, struggling to walk at first, the endless hours of rehab and massage and this is all before the camp got underway.

What we have now, just days away from the first defence of his IBF welterweight title is an elite level fighter, someone who I believe can go on and unify the 147lb division and someone who is in devastating form, ready to make a statement to the world in front of his home fans. Saturday in Sheffield is going to be an emotional night.

No one has taken Jo Jo Dan for granted - he has earned the right to challenge Kell as the No 1 and mandatory challenger - a position Kell was in not so long ago. He is confident and full of hope to become world champion but he has a wounded lion in front of him who is ready to bite.

It will be an awkward fight. Jo Jo is a southpaw who comes on strong late in fights. Another challenge for Kell will be handling the emotions of the situation in front of 10,000 people. But I believe in Kell. I think he has to impose himself early and I suspect he’ll produce a devastating performance with a stoppage somewhere in the middle rounds. We’ll see.

There are some huge plans ahead for Kell Brook but for now it’s all about Saturday. Live on Sky Sports and live on Showtime in the US - finally he gets his chance to get his big homecoming. It’s going to be some night.

Fight fans can tune into a packed bill from 7.30pm - Frankie Gavin makes his Matchroom debut against Bogdan Mitic ahead of his massive fight with Chris Van Heerden on May 9 in Birmingham and Gavin McDonnell continues his fairlytale career battling Ukraine’s Alexander Yegorov for the vacant European title.

Big-punching Sheffield middleweight Adam Etches could be in a fight of the year contender with Sergei Khomitsky, who dismantled London super-middleweight Frank Buglioni in his last visit to the UK. Kal Yafai, Charlie Edwards and Stephen Smith are also in action.

Last week we announced a huge show for May 30 at the O2 in London. After his destruction of Daniel Estrada at the same venue earlier this Year, Kevin Mitchell will go toe to toe with three-weight world champion Jorge Linares.

That fight, for the Venezuelan’s WBC world lightweight title, is going to be an absolute cracker. It is a real 50-50 fight.

It is going to be a huge night of boxing in the capital, a year after that massive occasion at Wembley. The Welsh Mayweather, Lee Selby, is fighting Evgeny Gradovich for the IBF featherweight title and that is another fight that could go either way. Lee is so talented.

Anthony Joshua is on the bill against Kevin Johnson, a loud American with some real talent. People ask me about AJ and how he is recovering after the stress fracture in his back. I watched him sparring in a three-hour session last week and he is looking devastating. I left that day feeling more convinced than ever that this guy is going to be the world heavyweight champion.

He will fight first on April 4 in Newcastle and I will make an announcement on his opponent in the coming days.

I will meet Barry McGuigan and Carl Frampton’s team in London today as we work towards making the fight everyone wants to see between Carl and Scott Quigg. Two world champions from Britain in the same division – they simply have to fight.

I have submitted my proposal to them and am waiting to hear what they have from their side. I feel we need to make progress now. The hope is for a summer fight, possibly on June 20. But all dates, venues and purse splits can’t be decided until we know where we are going with the broadcaster.

I think we need to reach some kind of agreement soon, probably the next two or three weeks, if we are to get this fight on in the summer. It really is the fight people want to see.

I should know in the next 24 hours what date James DeGale will fight Andre Dirrell for the IBF super-middleweight world title vacated by Carl Froch. Contrary to rumours stateside, it will most likely be in mid to late May on the US east coast.
