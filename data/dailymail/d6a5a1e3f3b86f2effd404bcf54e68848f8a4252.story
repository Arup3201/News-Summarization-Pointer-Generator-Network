A career criminal who admitted to fatally bludgeoning and dismembering a 9-year-old girl he was baby-sitting just days before Christmas was sentenced today to life in prison.

Michael Plumadore, from Indiana, last month pleaded guilty to murder, abuse of a corpse and removing a dead body from the scene in the December 22 death of Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon.

Prosecutors had considered the death penalty but agreed to life in prison without the possibility of parole in exchange for the guilty plea.

Life sentence: Michael Plumadore, left, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told police he 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon', right, who weighed just 41lbs, in the early hours of December 22 before dismembering her

Calling the case the 'worst of the 
worst,' Allen Superior Court Judge Allen Surbeck accepted that plea deal
Monday and added an extra 36 years: three more years for abuse of a 
corpse; three years for moving her body; and 30 years for the murder 
charge because Plumadore is a habitual offender.

Plumadore, who wore shackles and an orange-and-tan striped jumpsuit, expressed remorse for the girl's death during the hearing.

'I am sorry for the pain and 
sorrow I caused so many people. ... I'm truly sorry for the crime I 
committed and the pain I caused,' Plumadore said. 'No one should be 
exposed to the things I have done.'

Plumadore met Aliahna after her 
mother, Tarah Souders, moved her three daughters to the rundown trailer 
park where he lived to help take care of her dying father.

The park, 
which holds about two dozen homes, was teeming with convicted sex 
offenders, and neighbors say Souders asked her father if any of them – 
including Plumadore – could be a threat to her children.

Her father assured her the children would be safe.

The day Aliahna died, Plumadore 
was looking after the third-grader and her 6-year-old sisters at his 
mobile home because Souders was ill.  Aliahna weighed just 41 pounds when she died.

At last month's hearing, Plumadore
told the judge he killed Aliahna by repeatedly striking her in the head
with a brick. He said he then he cut her body up with a hacksaw.

'I put parts in my freezer and took the rest down to the Marathon station and put them in a Dumpster,' he said.

Police found the girl's head, 
hands and feet in the freezer at the mobile home where Plumadore had 
lived with Aliahna's grandfather, who had died about three weeks 
earlier. The other remains were thrown into trash bags and discarded at a
gas station.

The other girls weren't harmed.

Aliahna's death drew scrutiny to her mother's decision to move to the trailer park and leave the girl in Plumadore's care.

Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes

Sadness: Tarah Souders, mother of Aliahna, is pushed in a wheelchair by step-grandfather David Story and reacts in front of a memorial outside of a mobile home after her daughter's death

Convicted: James Lemmon, Aliahna's grandfather, was convicted of child molesting

Elizabeth Sepponen, a spokeswoman 
for the family, told Plumadore at the hearing that the family suffered 
not just the pain of the murder, but the judgment of the community.

'My cousin Tarah will forever be judged,' she said. 'You have put a rift in Fort Wayne that I hope someday can be healed.'

Surbeck said the death penalty 
would have been justified because of the dismemberment and the victim's 
age, as well as Plumadore's criminal history.

Since 1992, Plumadore has 
criminal records in Florida and North Carolina, including convictions 
for trespassing and assault, and an Indiana conviction for forgery.

'Any time you have a case where 
your client could face the death penalty, the goal is to save his life,'
said Plumadore's attorney, Anthony Churchward.

Prosecutor Karen Richards said 
Aliahna's family asked her not to seek the death penalty. She said she 
thought they needed finality.

'I can't think of a more horrific 
crime I've seen involving a more innocent victim. I think it transcends 
our entire community,' she said.

Aliahna's
father, Dawayne Maroney of Centerville, Iowa, said he knew Plumadore 
through Ms Souders and had no reason to distrust him.

'I
can't talk about it because I'm still coping with it. It's too hard to 
talk about,' he said at the time his daughter was murdered. 'I had no reason to suspect anything.'
