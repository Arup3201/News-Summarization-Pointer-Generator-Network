Javier Manquillo could be the next big Instagram hit but maybe not for the right reasons.

The on-loan Atletico Madrid defender sent a table tennis table crashing to the floor after an over-exuberant attempt at a smash.

It proved that his ping pong skills don't quite match up his footballing ability as Liverpool's star's took on England's  table tennis player Jonathan Taylor with comical consequences.

Manquillo looks on at the damage that was caused by his hilarious mishap which was caught on camera

Enrique had earlier posted a photo of the players meeting Taylor at Melwood holding a Liverpool shirt.

And It appears to be all fun and games for the former Newcastle full back at the moment ahead of Thursday's Europa League clash with Besiktas.

Moreno and Manquillo were videoed playing Mario Kart on Champions League night as the players enjoyed some downtime.

They face a tough test on Thursday at home to Besiktas in the Europa League knockout stages and will be without suspended winger Lazar Markovic.

Manquillo and his teammates will be hoping it's not a case of deja vu when Demba Ba returns to Anfield for the first time since his goal which ended their title dreams.

Brendan Rodgers' side then travel to fellow Champions League chasers Southampton on Sunday, knowing that nothing more than a win is required if they're to close the gap.
