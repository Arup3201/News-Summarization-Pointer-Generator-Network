Retired 15-time champion trainer Martin Pipe paid tribute to his former stable jockey AP McCoy after his success on On The Record at Uttoxeter allowed the pair to move level on 4,191 career wins.

Pipe said: ‘He's an inspiration to all the jockeys and to everyone in racing. He's marvellous for our sport and it's just great we've got someone like him.’

Matching Pipe’s tally was personal milestone for 19-time champion McCoy, who said: ‘This horse is obviously very appropriately named.

Legend: Fifteen-time champion trainer Pipe described McCoy as 'an inspiration to all jockeys'

‘This is just a personal thing with Martin Pipe. We are good friends and there had been a lot of banter about it.

‘I wouldn’t be surprised if we see him up at Newmarket doing a trainer’s course – I hope I have driven him mad!’

Pipe, whose son David now runs the family stable in Somerset, has joked about reapplying for his trainer’s licence should McCoy pass him.

The jockey has five more rides to do that today.

After McCoy had drawn level with his father, David tweeted: ‘Could there be a more appropriate way for @AP_McCoy to join my father in the 4191 club than success aboard On The Record?! #McCoyWatch’#

Next step: McCoy will have five chances to edge ahead of Pipe's record on Thursday
