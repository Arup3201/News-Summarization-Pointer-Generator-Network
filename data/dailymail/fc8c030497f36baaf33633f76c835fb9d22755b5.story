Click here to see what England captain Steven Gerrard has been up to this week. 

Samir Nasri isn't going to the World Cup this summer, but won't let that ruin his close season.

France manager Didier Deschamps opted not to pick the Manchester City midfielder for his squad to travel to Brazil.

That sparked widespread fury - not least from Nasri's girlfriend - and there is a strong belief that he'll be missed.

But the 26-year-old doesn't appear to be letting Deschamps' decision affect him as he posed on the beach with Anara Atanes in Dubai.

City played an end of season friendly against Al Ain on Thursday. 

Atanes launched a foul-mouthed attack on the France boss last week, claiming he was a 's*** manager' for not picking Nasri.

That resulted in Deschamps taking legal action against the model.

Meanwhile, Nani is taking a break with his family before linking up with the Portugual squad.

The Manchester United winger, whose form is of grave concern at Old Trafford, was named in the 23 on Monday.

He posed alongside fianceé Daniela Martins, captioned with: 'Family nice day to relax'.

Andy Carroll's mini tour carries on in earnest as well. The West Ham United striker has posted a picture of himself and The Only Way is Essex star girlfriend Billie Mucklow in the Maldives.
