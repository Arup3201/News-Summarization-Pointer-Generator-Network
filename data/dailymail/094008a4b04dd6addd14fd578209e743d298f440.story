Sexual threats and menacing one detainee with a power drill are expected to be among controversial CIA torture techniques revealed in a report later today.

The report will detail interrogation techniques used by CIA agents in the wake of 9/11, including threats to sexually assault one captive with a broomstick, according to sources.

It also describes how terrorist Abdel Rahman al Nashiri, suspected mastermind of the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, was threatened with a buzzing power drill. The tool was not used on him.

The White House has increased security at U.S. facilities across the globe today in preparation for a global backlash at the contents of the report.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest sparred with reporters today over news reports claiming that Secretary of State John Kerry called the chairwoman of the Senate committee discharging the torture report to ask her to delay its distribution, arguing that Kerry 'strongly supports' the release of the declassified document 'for the same valued-based reasons that the president does'

Meeting: President Obama today as he held brief talks with Prince William. The president has held talks with his predecessor over the report but the contents of the calls are not being disclosed

However the Obama administration remained committed to publishing the incendiary details, insisting that the torture program 'should never happen again'.

The report, which took years to produce, charts the history of the CIA's 'Rendition, Detention and Interrogation' program, which President George W. Bush authorized after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Most of the program was shut down by Bush before he left office, while Obama outlawed 'enhanced interrogation techniques' after his inauguration.

Yesterday a government official sparred with journalists over reports claiming that Secretary of State John Kerry tried to have the report delayed at the 11th hour.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that Kerry 'strongly supports' the release of the declassified document 'for the same valued-based reasons that the president does'.

At the same time he declined to extend the administration's proclaimed zeal for transparency to possible phone calls between the current president and former president Bush to discuss the contents of the report.

Earnest said any talks that may have taken place between Obama and Bush would remain private.

Even though the redacted paper will reportedly absolve the former president and his White House of knowledge of the extent of which the CIA was allowed terrorism suspects to be tortured in Europe and Asia in the wake of 9/11, Bush has openly opposed the the release of the document.

'We’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf,' he told CNN’s Candy Crowley during an interview that aired Sunday.

'These are patriots. And whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country, it is way off base,' he continued, calling the CIA operatives and directors about to be chastised 'really good people'.

Bush has been joined by other Republicans and members of the intelligence community in calling on the Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate's Intelligence Committee, to bag the truncated version of the still-classified 6,000 page report.

'I think this is a terrible idea,' House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, told Crowley on Sunday.

'Our foreign partners are telling us this will cause violence and deaths. Foreign leaders who have approached the government say you do this, it will cause violence and deaths. Our own intelligence community has assessed that this will cause violence and deaths,' he said. 

According to a report by Bloomberg View, Kerry called Feinstein on Friday to voice similar concerns and asked her to keep a lid on the report a little longer.

After word of Kerry's call to the California senator spread like wildfire, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement that Kerry 'called his former colleague to discuss the broader implications of the timing of the report's release because a lot is going on in the world.'

'He wanted to make sure that foreign policy implications were being appropriately factored into timing,' including 'our ongoing efforts against ISIL and the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world,' she said.

'That anyone would mischaracterize this call or question reasonable, proper, private discussions raises questions about what they’re trying to accomplish,' she added.

John Kerry allegedly tried to have the report delayed at the 11th hour and 'called his former colleague to discuss the broader implications of the timing of the report's release because a lot is going on in the world'

Asked today about claims that Kerry tried to get Feinstein to shelf the report, White House spokesman Earnest pointed reporters to the State Departments statements and reiterated the administration's approval of the Senate committee's decision to make public certain sections of classified document.

'I will allow Secretary Kerry to explain exactly why he made the phone call,' Earnest said.

He later stated that he stated that the legislative branch is constitutionally guaranteed oversight of the executive branch and it is 'free to exercise that oversight authority without inappropriate interference' from president and his administration.

At another point he said the White House has 'been candid from the beginning we believe it's the committee's decision to determine the appropriate timing for the release of this report.'

'The administration has taken the prudent steps to ensure that the proper security precautions are in place' and has been preparing 'for months now for this report's eventual release,' he said today.

Earnest refused to tell reporters what precautionary measures had been taken and at which embassies, saying that 'wouldn't be a wise security strategy,' but a Defense official told CNN on Monday that more than 6,000 Marines deployed abroad had been put on standby.

Pointing out that in his first days in office Obama used executive action to put a stop to the harsh interrogation procedures detailed in the report, Earnest told reporters that the president 'does not believe' they were 'justified

The president's spokesman said Obama believes that regardless of where one comes down in the debate, 'the use of these techniques was not worth it because of the harm that was done between our national values.'

Torture: The report concentrates on the activities of the CIA under the Bush administration, which also saw the establishment of a detention center at Guantanamo Bay which al Qaeda suspects continue to be held

The Obama administration official said that it doesn't matter if the torture tactics did 'unearth useful information.'

'Even if they did,' he said the president believes 'that it wasn't worth it, and it did not enhance the national security of United States of America.'

Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times in an interview published on Sunday that the interrogations undermined 'societal and constitutional values that we are very proud of.'

'Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again,' she said.

Former CIA Director Michael Hayden on Sunday pushed back against critics of the agency's behavior under his direction during the final years of Bush's tenure, from 2006 to 2009.

'To say that we relentlessly over an expanded period of time lied to everyone about a program that wasn’t doing any good — that beggars the imagination,' he said on CBS' Face the Nation.  

Hayden and other former CIA directors who served under Bush have promised to release a report of their own setting the record straight once the Senate has published the redacted document that it spent five years making.

'Once the release occurs, we’ll have things to say and will be making some documents available that bear on the case,' John McLaughlin, a former deputy director under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush told the New York Times on Sunday.

McLaughlin, who also served as acting director of the CIA for a short time in 2004, criticized the Senate report  and claimed it 'uses information selectively, often distorts to make its points, and as I recall contains no recommendations.'
