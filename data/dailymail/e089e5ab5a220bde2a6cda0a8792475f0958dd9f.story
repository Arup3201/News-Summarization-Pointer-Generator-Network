A member of the New York City Police Department was killed on his way to work early Friday morning.

Detective Paul Duncan was on his way to Queens at 4am when his car was struck head-on by 20-year-old Efren Moreano of Yonkers, who was driving the wrong way on the Sprain Brook Parkway.

The 46-year-old, who was just ten months from retirement, was pronounced dead on the scene.

The accident also caused major delays for thousands during their morning commute as they were stuck in traffic in the aftermath of the accident - including Duncan's wife and daughter.

Mrs. Duncan said her husband was set to retire in 10 months, and that he was a 'really good dad' to their 13-year-old daughter

Rechelle Duncan was dropping the couple's 13-year-old daughter off at school in the city when she came across a police car blocking her entrance to the parkway.

NBC New York reports that Mrs. Duncan had no idea what was causing the traffic, even after she again drove by the scene on the way home from dropping off their daughter, until later.

The two were high school sweethearts she later told reporters, as she clutched a photo of the two of them together and wiped back tears.

'He was thoughtful, he was disciplined. He made really good dinners,' she said of her husband of 20 years.

'He thought he was funny, a sharp dresser, a really good dad.'

She also said she will now stay focused on their daughter during this awful time.

It is still not known what caused the crash, and Moreano is in a coma.
