Eric Pickles revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down 'minimum standards', making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections

Eric Pickles has threatened to introduce new laws forcing councils to bring back weekly bin collections after admitting the Government’s previous efforts have done no more than slow the decline.

The Communities Secretary said it had taken Labour ten years to ‘destroy’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it.

He revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down ‘minimum standards’, making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections.

Councils should also be forced to publicise when long-running  contracts with waste firms are up for renewal, giving voters a chance  to demand a return to a weekly service, he said.

Admitting his frustration at the lack of progress so far, Mr Pickles told the Daily Mail: ‘If people get impatient with me, so be it. They aren’t as impatient as I am.’

The minister, who argues weekly rubbish collections are a ‘fundamental right’, has been under increasing pressure over his repeated pledges before the election to reverse the trend towards a fortnightly service that began under Labour.

But the proportion of councils operating black bag collections every other week has increased from 57 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent last year.

Most councils have shunned a £250million fund set up by Mr Pickles to pay for the reintroduction of weekly services.

Instead, the cash has been used to support the retention of weekly services in areas which still offer them.

Mr Pickles’ Department for Communities and Local Government only has authority over councils in England, where it says its efforts have slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections.

In parts of Scotland and Wales, where the department has no say, some councils are even considering collecting black bag rubbish only once every three weeks.

Mr Pickles insisted the Government had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in England, with four million more still getting them from councils outside the scheme. He said he had also abolished plans for new bin taxes and changed the law to scrap unfair fines for people who do not put  rubbish out correctly.

‘If we hadn’t done what we have, we would have virtually no weekly  collections. We’ve certainly saved six million, but it’s a process,’ the minister said. ‘It was always going to be very difficult to take on the bin barons, take on the industry and stand up for what ordinary punters want.’

Mr Pickles said he wanted to amend Labour’s Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 to include the minimum standards.

‘It would make it more difficult to do fortnightly collections and set out the type of collection that had to be made weekly,’ he added.
