Having won the Champions League with Liverpool in 2005, Rafael Benitez will play no part in this season's tournament with Napoli after the Italians were knocked out by Athletic Bilbao 4-2 on aggregate in Wedbesday's play-off.

Marek Hamsik put the Seie A side in front two minutes into the second half with a low strike but hosts Bilbao struck back in the second half with three goals in 13 minutes. 

Aritz Arduiz scored twice and Ibai Gomez drilled in the third to stun Benitez.

In Germany, Son Heung-min, who scored in Leverkusen's 3-2 first-leg win, took just two minutes on home soil to exploit poor Copenhagen defending to net again. Hakan Calhanoglu added another inside five minutes, with a free kick that Danny Amankwaa inadvertently deflected into his own net.

Stefan Kiessling added a third from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after Amankwaa fouled Tin Jedvaj, and he slid the ball into the net again in the 65th as Leverkusen qualified for the group stage for a ninth time.

Elsewhere, Malmo will be Sweden's first group stage representative in 14 years after beating Salzburg 3-0 to advance 4-2 on aggregate.

Meanwhile, Bulgarian champions Ludogorets progressed on penalties against Steaua Bucharest courtesy of centre back Cosmin Moti who was forced to go in goal for the shootout after the club's first-choice goalkeeper had been sent off.
