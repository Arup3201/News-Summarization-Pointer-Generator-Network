Five men and a woman have been charged over an alleged scam involving the popular dating site Match.com

The six, who were arrested by Hampshire Police, are all accused of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

They are alleged to have asked women to hand over 'significant amounts' of cash to men they met on the site.

Charges: Five men and a woman have been charged over an alleged scam involving the dating site Match.com

Detective Constable Darrin Carey said the reported victims came from the Basingstoke area, and across Hampshire and England.

'These charges come following a lengthy investigation into an alleged scam where women are asked to hand over significant amounts of cash after meeting men on the Match.com dating website,' he said.

The six suspects were remanded in custody at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court today.

The men are Emmanuel Oko, 29, Monty Emu, 28, Eberechi Ekpo, 26, Chukwuka Ugwu, 28, all from Southsea, Hampshire, and Adewunmi Nusi, 26, from Hermitage, Berkshire.

The woman is Brooke Boston, 28, from Southsea.

On its website, Match.com advises users not to give money to someone that they have met online.

It states: 'Criminals should not get away with scams whether on dating sites, over the internet or in any walk of life.

'While the authorities and dating sites work closely together to ensure a safe environment on the internet, we encourage everyone to apply the same caution when meeting people online as they would meeting through friends or in a bar.

'Never give money to anyone just as you would never give money to someone you recently met in a pub or cafe. Don’t share personal contact details off the site.

'If in doubt, use the highly visible “report a concern” button which flags issues to our care team.'

Det Con Carey has asked anyone with information to contact him on 101.
