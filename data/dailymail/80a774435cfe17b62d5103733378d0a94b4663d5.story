A teenager says his life was saved by memories of the late Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin after his leg was pierced by a stingray barb as he swam in shallow waters.

Corey Jamieson, 17, spent more than 24 hours in agony after the marine animal's razor sharp barb sank more than 6cm into his right leg, narrowly missing his bone, as he swam off a beach in Australia's Northern Territory.

He resisted the urge to pull the spike out in a desperate attempt to ease the pain because he knew that could cause serious bleeding and severe tissue damage. 

Irwin died in 2006 when he was struck in the heart by a barb as he filmed a marine documentary.

‘Steve Irwin did pop into my head when it happened. I remembered that they thought Steve Irwin had pulled the stingray barb out,' Mr Jamieson told Daily Mail Australia. 

The stingray left it's barb deeply lodged in Corey Jamieson's leg. The 17-year-old had to wait more than 24 painful hours until the barb was removed in a two hour operation.

After the attack, Mr Jamieson thought of the late Steve Irwin, and knew not to remove the barb from his leg in fear of making his injury worse. It is widely speculated that Irwin's fatal attack from a stingray was made worse when he allegedly pulled the barb out from his chest.

‘So I knew not to pull it out or the bleeding would be even worse, so I knew to let someone qualified medically take it out properly.' 

To add to his agony, Mr Jamieson had to wait more than 24 hours for the barb to be removed when  Darwin Private Hospital suffered a power outage.

The incident happened on Thursday morning while he swam at Mindil Beach in the Northern Territory, whilst doing his bronze medallion test for his school’s sport and recreation class.

‘I was swimming in waist-deep water. I was standing on the bottom and it was so murky you couldn’t see the bottom,’ he said.

‘I felt a sharp pain that I thought must have been a broken branch in my leg. But it was really the serrated edges of the barb.

‘I freaked out a little bit, but all the students down in the water with me helped me get to the beach.’

A lifesaver identified that it was a stingray barb and Mr Jamieson’s ‘upset and stressed out’ mother, Vicki Jamieson, rushed to her son's side.

However, the trouble was far from over once Jamieson got to hospital, as Darwin Private Hospital was in the grips of a major power outage.

The schoolboy’s operation was delayed by more than 24 hours, as he was constantly bumped down the list, waiting to transferred to the private hospital. 

X-rays eventually showed that the barb was 6cm above Jamieson's right knee – only narrowly missing the bone.

‘It was annoying and frustrating to wait for so long, but I do understand that my life wasn’t in danger like some of the other people that were coming into emergency,’ Mr Jamieson said.

A stingray’s venom is painful, but rarely fatal. The sting is near the base of the tale, containing a spine with serrated edges.

The stingray pierces the victim, at which point venom flows into the wound. However, the victim is also at risk of tissue necrosis, infection and other serious ailments.

Mr Jamieson was in surgery for almost two hours and is expected to be released from hospital on Monday. He has ‘lots’ of stitches but hasn’t seen the wound yet, because he’s ‘all bandaged up.’

His family says it is ‘typical’ that the photos of Corey on the beach after the incident all show the 17-year-old on his phone.

A blackout at Darwin Private Hospital meant Jamieson had to wait more than 24 hours to be moved to the private hospital, as his name kept getting bumped down the waiting list. He was being given morphine to deal with the excruciating pain
