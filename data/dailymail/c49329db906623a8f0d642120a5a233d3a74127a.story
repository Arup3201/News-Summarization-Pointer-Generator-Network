This doe-eyed dog clearly knows she's done something naughty.

C.J. Huffman from Baltimore, Ohio, filmed the moment he gave his roommate's pet pooch Lilo a telling off for chewing up her pet bed.

As the canine realizes she's is trouble, she sidles up to Huffman on the couch and showers him with licks.

The more Huffman disciplines Lilo, the more affectionate she gets. But the bribery fails to work. 

'I'm going to tell your dad when he gets home . . . He's going to be not happy with you,' Huffman says.

'I'm telling him that you chewed up your bed and you chewed up the foam. There was foam everywhere and there were pieces everywhere.'

Lilo then proceeds to lick Huffman on the nose and nuzzle him softly.

'No sucking up to me's not going to work,' the first grade teacher says, cracking a small smile at the camera.

Bribery won't work! As the canine realizes she's is trouble, she sidles up to Huffman on the couch and showers him with licks

After a brief pause, Huffman continues on with his monologue: 'He just bought that bed yesterday; he's going to be mad at you. I had to clean it up!

'[You] ought to be ashamed . . . brand new bed.' 

To date the video of Lilo's telling off has been watched more than 800,000 times.

Many have deemed the dog 'cute' and 'adorable.'

One viewer noted: 'Funny . . . Did not know dogs have these reactions.'

Huffman says as a result of the video's popularity, the bedding company Tempurpedic has offered his roommate a $425 dog bed as a peace offering for Lilo.
