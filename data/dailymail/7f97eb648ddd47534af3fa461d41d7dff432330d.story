The attorney for hip hop mogul Suge Knight claims the shocking new video of him mowing down two much with his truck actually helps his defense case.

Following Knight's brief appearance in a Los Angeles County court on Monday, defense lawyer Matthew Fletcher told reporters: '100percent it proves Suge Knight was attacked,' according to the Los Angeles Times.  

The video, published by TMZ today, was recorded by surveillance cameras at Tam's Burgers in Compton, Los Angeles on January 29. It shows one of Knight's alleged victims, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, confront him as soon as he pulls up to the parking lot.

Knight throws his truck into reverse, knocking Sloan down. He then shifts the vehicle back into drive, running Sloan over and hitting Terry Carter, who was standing nearby.  

Suge Knight made a brief appearance in court on Monday on the murder and attempted murder case he faces as a result of the hit-and-run

Carter, a 55-year-old grandfather, had his head crushed beneath Knight's truck and was killed.

Knight says the video exonerates him. Defense lawyer Fletcher says it shows that he was in danger the moment he pulled up to the restaurant where Dr. Dre was filming scenes for his NWA biopic. He says the video shows a gun in Sloan's waistband.

'They started it.They attacked him… If Suge had put it in park and got out, he’s dead,' Fletcher said Monday

According to TMZ, prosecutors argue that the video shows that opposite. They say that after Knight threw his truck into reverse, he should have been able to safely flee the scene if his life was indeed in danger. 

Knight, who is charged with murder and attempted murder for the hit-and-run, is due to appear in court today for an evidence hearing. 

This is the moment that Terry Carter was hit and killed by Suge Knight's truck in January. Police say Carter's head was crushed under the vehicle

The confrontation happened after Suge tried to approach Dr. Dre while he was filming 'Straight Out of Compton.' He says he wanted to make peace with the fellow hip hop mogul after a falling out, according to TMZ.

Instead, he was confronted by Sloan, who was working security for Dr Dre. Knight's lawyers say he was threatened with a gun and that he feared for his life. 

He says he was surrounded by a group of armed men and that his only way out was to drive through Sloan and Carter. 

He argues that he believed he would be shot if he continued to reverse and that the only safe way out was for him to drive forward, through Sloan and Carter. 

The video also shows a man approach Sloan, who was writhing on the ground, and pull something from his waistband. 

TMZ reports that Knight is claiming that is proof Sloan had a gun at the time of the confrontation. 

Carter's family told TMZ they want the video released to the public to show he Knight mowed him down and killed him.

Carter's funeral was attended by 2,000 people and he was saluted as a businessman and a community leader who mentored neighborhood children. 

Knight is being held without bail and has been admitted to the hospital three times since being jailed. 

He claims he is going blind due to injuries from previous gunshot wounds.  

The 49-year-old former Death Row Records CEO fired his attorneys and hired a new legal team. 

He also faces charges from a September 5, 2014 incident in which he and Katt Williams allegedly stole a camera from a celebrity photographer.
