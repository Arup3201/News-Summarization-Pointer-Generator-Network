Refusal: Mark Barwell was forced to walk to hospital carrying an oxygen tank because a bus driver refused to accept his £5 note

A man was forced to walk to hospital carrying an oxygen tank because a bus driver refused to accept his £5 note.

Mark Barwell, 27, who suffers cystic fibrosis and needs a special apparatus to help him breathe, was being treated at Royal Brompton Hospital.

He was outraged when the driver of the 211 bus en route to the hospital said he could not travel the two or three stops because the driver did not have change on Monday.

The patient from Woking, Surrey had walked up King’s Road in Chelsea after doctors at the hospital advised him he could go out.

As
he decided to turn around he felt weak and so decided to board the bus 
but was told he could not get on, despite carrying an oxygen tank, as he
did not have the exact change or a valid Oyster card.

The
in-patient had worked at least 500 yards with his breathing apparatus 
he needs to combat the condition which clogs internal organs with thick,
sticky mucus making it hard to breathe and digest food.

The
factory worker told the Evening Standard: ‘I was annoyed and I didn’t 
really have the energy to stand there arguing with him so I just got off
the bus and walked back.

‘I had a couple of tubes up my nose that go up the side of my face, it was pretty obvious.’

Outraged: Mr Barwell, who suffers cystic fibrosis and needs a special apparatus to help him breathe, was being treated at Royal Brompton Hospital

Transport for London has since apologised today. Mike Weston, operations director for London Buses, said: ‘We are extremely sorry to hear about the problems reported by Mark Barwell. 

‘We are awaiting the results of an urgent investigation by Abellio, which operates the route.

‘Bus drivers are trained to assist vulnerable passengers, and if this training has not been followed the necessary action will be taken.’
