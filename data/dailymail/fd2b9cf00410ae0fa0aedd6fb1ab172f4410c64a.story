Voters believe Ed Miliband’s Labour party is ‘nice but dim’ and not capable of taking the tough decisions needed as Prime Minister, damning new polling reveals.

The Labour leader is seen weaker, less charismatic and worse in a crisis than David Cameron, as pollsters warn he will have to ‘defy history’ to take power after just one term in opposition.

But the most damaging revelation is that voters see Mr Miliband as more like Harry Enfield’s character Tim Nice But Dim than a future Prime Minister.

In a withering assessment of the main opposition, voters were asked if Labour's 'heart is in the right place and it does NOT have what it takes  to get what it wants done in government'.

Almost a third (31 per cent) of people agreed Labour under Mr Miliband is 'nice but dim', compared to only 14 per cent of Mr Cameron's Tories.

The proportion of people who voted Labour in 2010 who now think the party is nice but dim was even higher, at 33 per cent. Another 10 per cent of Labour voters think the party is 'mean'.

A small majority of people think Labour will 'be on the side of people like you' and will ensure public services provide good value for money.

But on 10 other measures polled, more people think a Labour government would fail rather than succeed, including having the courage to take tough decisions, defending British interests on Europe and immigration and learning from the mistakes of the past.

Voters are most likely to think Labour is 'nice but dim' while the the Tories are viewed as 'mean and dim'

Just 21 per cent thought a Labour majority government would 'keep their promises' against 47 per cent who think they would not.

While the Tories also scroe badly on governing in the interests of the whole of Britain, not just their friends, and learning from the mistakes of the past, they are well ahead on the economy.

More than half of people (54 per cent) think a Conservative majority government will 'take the right decisions to help Britain's economy recove, while just 28 per cent thought they would not.

For Labour, less than a third (32 per cent) thought Mr Miliband would make the right call on the economy.

With less than two years to go until the general election, voters are evenly split on which main party leader they would like to see in Number 10 after polling day.

According to the YouGov survey, when forced to choose 40 per cent opted for Mr Cameron and 41 per cent said Mr Miliband.

Two years before the 2010 election, Mr Cameron had a 12-point lead over Gordon Brown.

Six months before the 1997 Labour landslide, Tony Blair had a 35-point lead over John Major.

When forced to choose, only 83 per cent of people who voted Labour in the 2010 election would prefer Mr Miliband to be Prime Minister over Mr Cameron.

Crucially, less than half of Lib Dem voters would want to see Mr Miliband in Number 10, in a blow to his hopes of wooing supporters disaffected by Nick Clegg’s decision to go into government with the Tories.

While Mr Cameron's personal ratings have fallen in the last two years, he is still seen as being more decisive, stronger and good in a crisis than Mr Miliband

Analysis of the way voters view the two main parties reveals Labour’s small lead is more a result of Tory unpopularity than any enthusiasm for Mr Miliband.

Despite the economy flat-lining under the coalition, just one in three voters think Labour would take the right decisions to secure greater prosperity.

YouGov’s Peter Kellner said: ‘There is not a single time in more than eighty years when an opposition party has returned to power at the first attempt with an overall majority.

‘If Ed Miliband does head a majority government after 2015, Labour’s victory will be the first of its kind in modern times,’ he wrote in an article for Progress.

‘In as far as Labour’s figures look good, this is because so many people think badly of the Tories, rather than because of wide public enthusiasm for Labour.’

Labour is seen as more likely to keep its promises than the Tories, but much less likely to take tough and unpopular decisions

Labour scores better on being on the side of voters and getting value for money from public services

The trials and tribulations of being in power have taken their toll on Mr Cameron’;s personal ratings, and he is now seen as less decisive, strong and honest than two years ago.

But the Prime Minister’s decline has not been matched by any improvement in the Miliband ‘brand’, Mr Kellner noted.

Two years ago only 36 per cent of voters credited the Labour leader with any positive attribute. Today the figures stands at just 41 per cent.

Mr Kellner concludes: ‘Overall, the fact that Miliband has closed the gap with Cameron has everything to do with the Prime Minister’s mounting unpopularity and nothing with Miliband’s own appeal.’

So far he has failed to convince the public that he would be a competent Prime Minister who is able to take tough decisions or assure voters that Labour has learned from the mistakes it made last time.

Mr Miliband is warned that he will struggle to win seats from both the Lib Dems and Tories at the next election.

Predictions that the party will take 14 seats from the Lib Dems 'look like a stretch', Mr Kellner said.
