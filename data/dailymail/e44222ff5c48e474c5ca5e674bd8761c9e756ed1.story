A U.S. construction expert has just finished making the first 3D-printed castle. 

Andrey Rudenko put up the building — complete with turrets and a spire — in his garden in Minnesota.

Although it is just big enough for someone to stand in, the castle is a watershed moment for the technology.

Rudenko's castle was printed completely outside in his garden, where the cement sets quickly in the warm summer temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius

3D printers work like conventional printers, but lay down layers of plastic — or in this case concrete — rather than ink. 

Captivated by 3D printers, Mr Rudenko, who has a background in engineering and design, created his own. 

He printed out a mixture of cement and sand using technology and software from the open-source RepRap 3D printing project.

The structure is large enough for adults to walk into, and the darker area of the castle, which measures 50cm in height, was constructed in eight hours using his 3D printer

Rudenko's castle was printed completely outside in his garden, where the cement sets quickly in the warm summer temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius.

The structure is large enough for adults to walk into, and the darker area of the castle, which measures 50cm in height, was constructed in eight hours using his 3D printer.

He said: 'I still have some imperfections, mostly when I stop the printer, but if I print nonstop, the layers look great.'

'Though I'm not completely finished with this structure yet, from the current progress, I can already see that I am ready for the next step, which is printing a house with this technology.'
