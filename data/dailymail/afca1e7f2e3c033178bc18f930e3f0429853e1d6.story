New research sheds fresh light on the deadly toll of tobacco showing the an astonishing two-thirds of smokers will die early from smoking-related health issues. 

The new Australian research, published by BMC medicine, showed that doctors had a low estimate of smokers who die from their habit and that the actual figure was roughly 67 per cent. 

The earlier you put your cigarettes out permanently, the better your chance of avoiding those illnesses. 

New research shows smoking is even more deadly than guessed, and that only 10 cigarettes a day can double a smoker's risk of fatal disease

'The relative risks of adverse health effects increase with increasing intensity of smoking,' said the study,' 'measured by the amount of tobacco smoked per day, and with increasing duration of smoking.'

Smoking can lead to elevated risk for at least 13 different cancers. 

The Washington Post reports that 10 cigarettes a day will double the smoker's risk of death while a pack quadruples the numbers.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 42.1 million Americans smoke cigarettes, a habit which remains the number one cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S.

At least one in five of the country's 480,000 annual deaths can be tied to smoking. 

'We knew smoking was bad, but we now have direct, independent evidence that confirms the disturbing findings that have been emerging internationally,' Emily Banks, the study's co-author and a researcher at the Australian National University, said upon releasing the findings.

Smoking remains the top preventable cause of disease and death in the United States

The study examined a pool of more than 200,000 people.

And more than just the obvious health impact, there's a financial burden as smokers run up about $6,000 more annually in health care costs and productivity than their smoke-free counterparts for their employers. 

Smokers tend to require an average of 40 per cent more in health care costs, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. 

There have been multiple initiatives to get smoker to quit, from banning smoking in bars and restaurants and parks to tax hikes. 

Its estimated that about 30 per cent of adults below the poverty line smoke with only 16 per cent of those at or above that level taking up the habit.
