Long form: Amanda Knox, who was acquitted of murder in 2011, is releasing her memoir on April 30

While sitting in her prison cell in Italy, thousands of miles from home, Amanda Knox contemplated how she could kill herself.

The shocking new detail is one of many penned in the American student’s new memoir, ‘Waiting to be Heard,’ which is slated to be published at the end of the month.

The Seattle-native spent four years in a prison cell in Perugia after being convicted for the murder of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher. Knox also revealed that while living in her flat abroad, ‘marijuana was as common as pasta.’

Those details are only a few reported by the New York Times, which obtained an advance copy of the memoir. 

Knox writes that she at times felt trapped and pondered ending her life.

‘I started to understand how you could feel so locked inside your own life that you could be so desperate to escape, even if that meant that you would no longer exist.’

She writes that she was shocked to 
learn she was put on suicide watch after her 2009 conviction, and was 
equally surprised when a prison psychiatrist asked her if she had ever 
contemplated it.

According to the Times, Knox at one point considered suffocating herself with a garbage bag.

Two weeks from now, readers will discover the ins and outs of the Seattle student’s grueling ordeal and the transformation from a carefree college student to an internationally-recognized convicted murderer.

The memoir, published by 
HarperCollins, is due to be released on April 30, and contain 
first-person accounts from the trial and its immediate aftermath.

But 
according to ABC News, it does not include her life after the trial, or 
her reactions after Italy’s highest court demanded last month that she 
face a retrial.

Miss Knox discussed how she is dealing with her emotions in an interview with ABC News, which will be aired later this month.

She revealed: 'Things creep up on me and I'm overwhelmed by the feeling of helplessness, desperation and fear to even hope. My heart races and it leaves me paralysed until I can breathe it away.'

In her memoir, she writes: 'When 
Meredith was murdered and I was arrested, it was so shocking. It was 
paralysing, Everything toppled.'

The Seattle-native also writes that 
being naïve and proud contributed to her initial guilty conviction, 
judging herself for acting ‘like a lost, pathetic child’ when dealing 
with Italian authorities.

She also denied that she was 
performing cartwheels outside the police station after she was arrested,
an infamous action that was widely reported at the time of the trial.

According to the book, the police interrogated Miss Knox for hours and would slap her on the back of her head. Italian police are taking legal action against her parents for making similar allegations.

According to the Times, HarperCollins
publishers have described Knox as intelligent and charming, and did not
shy away from unsavory facts. In fact, Knox is reported to want to use 
this platform to confront the rumors, myths, and confusion associated 
with the case that enthralled the world.

She writes that the memoir is about setting the record straight.

During the murder trial for 
21-year-old Kercher, the Italian prosecution condemned Knox as a ‘she 
devil’ and used passages from Knox’s journal where she wrote she would 
‘kill’ for a pizza.'

Miss Knox writes that the prosecution took these entries out of context, saying that it was merely ‘gallow humor.’

She also claims that she was reading a Harry Potter book, smoking marijuana and watching a film at her boyfriend's flat on the night of the murder.

Her time behind bars at Capanne 
Prison, outside of Perugia, was extremely difficult for Knox, who writes
that she was taunted by her cell-mates for being a snob, noticing she 
spent most of her time behind bars reading and writing letters.

She was only allowed outside for one hour a day.

She writes: 'My guard wanted to know who I had sex with, how I like it - and if I'd do it with him.'

ABC News notes that all throughout the 484-page memoir, Knox professes her innocence. 

The book will be published in the 
U.S., but not in the U.K., amid fears that the memoir could further 
complicate the retrial that Italy’s highest court dramatically ruled 
last month. 

Since her release, Knox has been at Washington State studying creative writing.

Italian Raffaele Solecito was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher but the pair were freed in October 2011 after their convictions 
were overturned due to a lack of evidence. However, both now face a retrial after Italy's highest court demanded it.

Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University, was found 
semi-naked and with her throat cut in a house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007.

Miss Knox 
became 'Foxy Knoxy' and received the brunt of the attention as she 
shopped for underwear after the killing and turned cartwheels in front 
of investigators.

Sollecito tells how he met Knox at a classical music concert in Perugia before going on to spend the night with her.

Within a week, Miss Kercher was murdered and the couple fell instantly under the spotlight of suspicion.

In the hours after the gruesome 
murder scene was discovered, the duo was notoriously photographed 
kissing and cuddling in the street outside while police investigated.

Italian authorities 
later described Sollecito’s behavior ass ‘odd’, and acknowledged the two had 
no real alibi 'except each other.'

They eventually told police that they had been smoking marijuana and having sex in Sollecito's apartment before falling asleep.

The pair was imprisoned days after the November 1, 2007 death of Kercher in the central Italian city. Both would remain there for nearly four years.

An appeals court overturned their conviction and freed them last fall, issuing a 143-page opinion that blasted the utter lack of evidence against them.

Rudy Guede, a petty criminal who was convicted separately, remains imprisoned and is serving a 16-year-sentence.

The
couple were arrested several days after Kercher's death and later 
convicted in proceedings that made headlines around the world.

Prosecutors portrayed the case as a 
drug-fuelled sexual assault, and Knox and Sollecito were sentenced to 26
years and 25 years, respectively.

The
appeals court found the prosecution's theory to be unsupported by any 
evidence.

Prosecutors have appealed the acquittal, and Italy's highest 
court will hear their arguments next March.

Sollecito met Knox at a classical music concert at the Universita per Stranieri, the University for Foreigners, on October 25, 2007 - a week before Kercher's death.

He asked for her number, and she told him to come by the bar where she'd be working later that night.

At the end of the shift, he writes in his new book, they took a walk, held hands and kissed. She accepted an invitation to come back to his apartment and spent the night.

Soon the couple became inseparable. She began spending the nights at his apartment. They shopped for groceries together, and took a sightseeing day trip to Assisi.

Guilty: Rudy Guede, a drug dealer, was convicted of Kercher's murder

Meredith Kercher, a British student studying abroad in Perugia, was found murdered in the flat she shared with U.S. student Amanda Knox on November 1, 2007. She, along with Knox and Sollecito were studying at the city’s University for Foreigners.

In the days following the murder, Knox, her Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and Perugian resident Rudy Guede were all arrested for the grisly crime. 

The horrific murder of the bright young woman shocked the world, and for the next four years, the world watched as Knox and Sollecito were put on trial for the murder of the 21-year-old, who suffered 43 separate knife wounds. 

While being questioned by the police following the murder of her flatmate, Knox was reportedly performing cartwheels in the station and sat on Sollecito’s lap during the interrogation.

However, during her appeal, Knox addressed her actions, saying: ‘Everyone deals with tragedy in their own way.’

Guede, a drug dealer who was originally from the Ivory Coast, was later convicted of the murder. 

While Knox and Sollecito were acquitted of their charges, authorities rejected Guede's appeal after his DNA was found inside of Kersher’s body. 

To this day, there are many unknowns in the case, though the prosecution’s original story – that Guede broke into the cottage and tried to rape Kercher with the assistance of a drug-addled Knox and Sollecito – is deeply flawed and is now known to be far from the truth.
