Homeopathy was condemned as ‘rubbish’ by Britain’s chief medical officer yesterday, who admitted she is ‘perpetually surprised’ it is available on the NHS.

Professor Dame Sally Davies also described homeopaths as ‘peddlers’ and spoke of her concern that they can prescribe pills and potions to treat malaria and other illnesses.

Giving evidence to an influential committee of MPs, Dame Sally said that homeopathy doesn’t work past the placebo effect.

Civil servants watered down an article on the NHS Choices website that had warned there was no evidence that homeopathic remedies work

In other words, any benefits patients
 perceive are simply caused by them receiving attention and simply 
expecting to feel better.

Her outspoken views are in conflict 
with the policy of the Health Service, which spends around £4million a 
year on funding homeopathic hospitals and on prescriptions and 
referrals.

Homeopathy, which has the backing of 
Prince Charles, claims to prevent and treat diseases using diluted forms
 of plants, herbs and minerals.

It is based on the principle that an illness can be treated by substances that produce similar symptoms.

For example, it is claimed onions, which make eyes itchy and tearful, can be used to relieve the symptoms of hay fever.

Other treatments include anti-malaria
 tablets made from African swamp water, rotting plants and mosquito eggs
 and larvae. But scientists argue the ‘cures’ are so diluted they are 
unlikely to contain any of the original substance.

Asked about her views on homeopathy 
by the Commons science and technology committee, Dame Sally – a 
consultant haematologist, or specialist in blood diseases, at the 
Central Middlesex Hospital from 1985 until 2011 – said: ‘I’m very 
concerned when homeopathic practitioners try to peddle this way of life 
to prevent malaria or other infectious diseases.’

She added: ‘I am perpetually 
surprised that homeopathy is available on the NHS.’ Dame Sally concluded
 by saying homeopathy ‘is rubbish’. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has 
endorsed homeopathy.

In 2007, while shadow minister for the disabled, he signed an early day motion backing its use on the NHS.

Fifteen per cent of Britons have used homeopathy at some point in their lives.

The exact amount of NHS spending on 
the discipline is unclear but various homeopathic associations say it is
 as high as £4million a year.

The Department of Health said it is up to local NHS organisations to decide whether to fund it.
