LA Clippers player Blake Griffin has been criticized for making an obscene gesture on the bench during a game.

The 25-year-old, who recently celebrated being picked as a starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star squad, was seen pulling the head of one of his trainers towards his crouch as the camera panned towards him.

The power forward was receiving treatment for his knee while on the sidelines against the Brooklyn Nets  when he started laughing and yanked the staff member's head.

Obscene gesture Blake Griffin of the LA Clippers was seen pulling the head of one of his trainers towards his crouch as the camera panned towards him during a game against the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday 

Kevin Harlan, who was commentating on the game for TNT, quickly condemned Griffin's actions on air, saying: 'Noooo, don’t do that.' 

Others have since admonished his actions on social media after footage of the act went viral.  

Some commented on YouTube videos saying it was disgusting while others said it was inappropriate. 

Troy Brooks commented on Sports Illustrated: 'The bad thing about this is had the trainer retaliated in any way he would lose his job. However, this classless move in front of thousands of fans and now millions of people will result in few laugh by Griffin's "peers" and nothing else. 

'Here is an employee in essence being subjugated to sexual harassment at the workplace and the Clippers brass and NBA will do nothing saying it was just a joke.'

Ben Brown also tweeted: 'Just in case you needed more reason to hate this tool.' 

Ricky J. Marc also posted on the social media site, asking: 'Did Blake Griffin just sexually harass his trainer?'

Another Twitter user said: 'If that Clippers trainer had been a female, we wouldn't even be debating this -- everyone would be calling for Blake Griffin's head.'
