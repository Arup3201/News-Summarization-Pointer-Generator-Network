David Villa and New York City FC made their MLS debuts together on Sunday night as football fever took hold in the US, although it all appeared too much for team-mate Sebastian Velasquez.

Villa's side were held to a 1-1 draw with another franchise making their first appearance Orlando City in a game that attracted 63,000 to the Orlando Citrus Bowl Stadium in Florida.

The former Spain and Barcelona striker posted an Instagram picture of himself sat next to an unflattering image of Velasquez sleeping open mouthed on the flight home, accompanied by the caption: 'Back in New York! What great company from @tian26 on the flight...'

Villa provided an assist for Mix Diskerud to open the scoring for the visitors against the run of play but it was another global superstar who grabbed the headlines.

Orlando City marquee signing and Brazil legend Kaka scored a late equaliser with a heavily deflected free-kick to send the crowd wild and avoid getting the new chapter in his career off to a losing start.

Villa has embraced life across the Atlantic, which has included collaborating with Irish singer/songwriter Sarah Packiam and rapper MC Sterlin for an unofficial NYC FC song titled ''New York City All the Way' (see below).
