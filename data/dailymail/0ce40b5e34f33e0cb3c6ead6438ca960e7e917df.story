'Immeasurable harm': Sir Cliff Richard, pictured, has suffered 'irreparable damage to his reputation' as a result of the BBC broadcasting live coverage of a police raid on his home, MPs say today

Sir Cliff Richard has suffered ‘enormous, irreparable damage to his reputation’ as a result of the BBC broadcasting extensive live coverage of a police raid on his home, MPs say today.

In a blistering report, the Home Affairs Select Committee attacks the BBC and South Yorkshire Police for their handling of the sexual abuse case.

Lawyers for the star have also criticised the ‘premature and disproportionate’ reporting which has caused ‘immeasurable harm’ to the singer, who is still under police investigation.

TV reporters were able to film live aerial shots of a raid on Sir Cliff’s home on August 14 after being tipped off in advance.

The chief constable of South Yorkshire Police told MPs the BBC had put his force in ‘a very difficult position’ after confronting officers with leaked information about the planned search.

David Crompton said his force was convinced the BBC would run a story about the investigation without some kind of deal so felt it had no option but to warn the journalist, Dan Johnson, when it was taking place.

In today’s report the MPs say that, when the corporation’s reporter ‘threatened to break the story prematurely unless he was given inside access to the raid on Sir Cliff’s home, South Yorkshire Police should not have tried to cut a deal with him’.

Instead, they argue, the force should have approached senior BBC executives to explain the damage that such premature disclosure could do to the investigation. 

The report concludes: ‘In the absence of any such approach from South Yorkshire, the BBC was well within its rights to run the story, although as a result Sir Cliff himself has suffered enormous, irreparable damage to his reputation.’

Sir Cliff’s £3million apartment was searched by officers from South Yorkshire and Thames Valley Police as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assault on a young boy at a religious event in 1985.

A BBC crew arrived on the scene before the police while Sir Cliff – who vigorously denies any wrongdoing and has not been arrested – was abroad.

Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘South Yorkshire Police’s handling of this situation was utterly inept. No British citizen should have to watch their home being raided by the police live on television. 

'Sir Cliff Richard has suffered enormous and irreparable damage to his reputation and he is owed an apology.’

Yesterday Sir Cliff’s lawyer, Gideon Benaim, said: ‘Leaving aside the actions of the police, the actions of the BBC have also caused very serious harm to our client at a time when he had not been interviewed by the police, or arrested or charged.

‘The BBC ... coverage has led to immeasurable harm to our client and was both premature and disproportionate.’

Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘The committee chairman has already said that the BBC acted “perfectly properly” in handling this story, and we’re pleased today’s report confirms this.’
