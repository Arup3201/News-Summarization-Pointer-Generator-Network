Jose Mourinho has urged Eden Hazard to make himself a Chelsea legend after confirming the forward will sign a bumper new contract.

As Sportsmail revealed in September, the Belgium international will pen a new five-year deal worth in the region of £200,000-per-week - cementing his position as one of the club's top earners.

His contract is a reward for a string of brilliant performances for the Blues since his arrival in 2012.

But Mourinho insists there is much more to come from his diminutive forward, insisting Hazard can become a Stamford Bridge legend.

However, the Special one claims Hazard can only be considered a Blues great once he starts adding to his trophy tally.

'He will sign, I was never worried about it, since the moment I met his father,' said the Blues boss.

'Everything was very clear about their intentions and their happiness to stay at Chelsea.

'After that, it becomes a numbers situation. When it becomes a number situation I'm more than happy to be out, but my club always told me that the situation would finish with a new contract. 

'Can he become one of Chelsea's all-time greats? I think so. He needs to win titles, because titles make players historic.

'I don't know players who are considered legends in clubs without winning titles. He has to do that. But the potential, everybody knows.'

Meanwhile, Thibault Courtois is set to be available for Monday's clash against Stoke after missing last weekend's win over Hull with a groin injury.

It means Petr Cech is set to find himself back on the bench for the Barclays Premier League encounter against Mark Hughes' men, despite keeping a clean sheet against Steve Bruce's side.

But Mourinho insists he won't find it any harder to drop the Czech Republic goalkeeper following his display last weekend.

The Portuguese added: 'Had Petr made it a tougher decision? No. Petr's performances are the normal performances from one of the three best goalkeepers in the world, so simple.'
