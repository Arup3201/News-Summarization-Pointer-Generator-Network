Police are hunting for this man who cycled off the end of Caerphilly railway station and into a tunnel, causing 14 hours of delays

A cyclist who rode into train tunnel was being hunted by police today after causing hours of delays.

Transport police released CCTV photos of the 'reckless idiot' cyclist wheeling along the train tracks into the mile-long tunnel at 6.12am on Wednesday.

It caused a major safety alert - and more than 14 hours of delays on the main commuter line between Cardiff and Caerphilly in South Wales.

The alarm was raised when the cyclist disappeared into the tunnel - and was feared he could be trapped inside.

Trains on the busy line were placed on caution at first before the services were suspended while police searched the track.

British Transport Police spokesman Morgan Andrews said: 'I am genuinely shocked to see that, despite our constant warnings some people are still willing to risk their lives by trespassing on the tracks.

'This was absolutely senseless behaviour and I cannot overstate just how dangerous it is.'

The man was seen to cycle off the end of the platform at Caerphilly railway station before walking along the track and into the tunnel.

He could have cycled all the way along the tunnel which cuts through Caerphilly mountain to the Cardiff suburb of Lisvane on the other side.

Mr Andrews said: 'Luckily, on this occasion, no one was injured, but the scenario could easily have been different.

British Transport Police thought the man could have become stuck inside the tunnel which runs between Caerphilly and the Cardiff suburb of Lisvane

The man cycled off the end of this station platform, causing 14 hours of delays on the main commuter line

'Train drivers will not be expecting anyone other than railway workers to be on the line, and by the time they see someone trespassing it could be too late.

'I am asking for the public's help to identify this person and would urge anyone who has any information to come forward.'
