An Oakland, California public school kid who has been accepted to three Ivy League schools says he has to carry around proof of his 5.0 GPA and sky high SAT score because he looks like a 'street dude.'

Akintunde Ahmad has his choice of attending Yale, Brown, Columbia or a slew of other prestigious universities but the people he meets don't believe him thanks to the clothes he wears and dreadlocks he sports.

To combat those snap judgments, Ahmad keeps photos of his impressive grades and 2100 SAT score on his phone and can flash them at any disbeliever he wants.

Judgmental: Oakland, California high school senior Akintunde Ahmad was accepted to Yale, Brown and Columbia as well as a slew of other schools but says people won't believe it because of his looks

Proof: Ahmad carries around proof of his sky high GPA and 2100 SAT score to prove to the judgmental disbelievers

The 17-year-old Oakland Tech student proudly attests to his lifelong public education and wears the same baseball cap, gold chains, loose clothes and dreadlocks as many of his classmates.

While the outstanding student's record speaks for itself, some believe his appearance says a lot, too. And those folks have been doubting or overlooking him for much of his already accomplished life.

Thankfully for the promising teen, others like his Oakland school principal mother have always urged him not to give in to others' doubts.

'Like, my whole life, people have been telling me to stay on this path and everything will fall, the cards will fall like you want them to, so,' Ahmad told KGO.

'Wow! When were you going to tell me?': Ahmad's mother recalls the shock she felt upon hearing her son's SAT score, which he neglected to mention to her

Giving him even more reason to gloat: Ahmad is also an accomplished baseball player and plays three instruments. But he manages to stay modest.

His mom Zarina recalled asking ehr son about his SAT score months back.

"'Oh I got it back...I have a 2100"' she recalled him saying. 'I'm like, "Wow! When were you going to tell me?"'

Ahmad has yet to make a decision about which school he's going to choose.

He thinks it will be either Brown or Yale and plans to study pre-law or pre-med.

Ahmad says he plans to choose either Yale or Brown, but doesn't mention any plans to cut his hair or change his fashion any time soon
