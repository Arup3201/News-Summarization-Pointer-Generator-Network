A campaign has been launched to keep the last self-portrait painted by Sir Anthony Van Dyck in Britain.

The 1640 painting, which was in a private collection, has been sold and could be sent overseas.

A Government export bar gives campaigners three months to raise £12.5million to buy it.

A self-portrait by Sir Anthony Van Dyck at the National Portrait Gallery in central London. The Gallery and the Art Fund, launch an appeal to raise £12.5 million to secure the painting for the nation

The National Portrait Gallery and the Art Fund have £1.2million so far.

Van Dyck, who was born in what is now Belgium, came to England in 1632 as court painter to King Charles I.

The gallery’s director, Sandy Nairne, said: ‘Van Dyck is one of the greatest artists to have worked in Britain.

‘No other artist has had such a 
dramatic impact on British portraiture.

'He decisively turned it away 
from the stiff, formal approach of Tudor and Jacobean painting, 
developing a distinctive fluid, painterly style that was to dominate 
portraiture well into the 20th century.

'It is very rare to have the opportunity to make a painting as important as Van Dyck’s last self-portrait available to everyone in Britain.’

Artist Gillian Wearing said saving the painting would be 'a legacy for many generations to come'.

She said: 'This is a fantastic and evocative Van Dyck self-portrait painting, that would enrich our whole culture if it can be made available to the public.

'We see Van Dyck painting his own portrait, looking at himself through a mirror. Or perhaps he is suggesting that we are the sitters as we look at him in the eye so directly?'

The painting, currently on show at the central London gallery, will go around the country on a three-year tour if it is saved.
