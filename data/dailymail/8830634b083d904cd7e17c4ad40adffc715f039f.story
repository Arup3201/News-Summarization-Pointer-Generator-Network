Doctors who scanned a toddler's chest to try and discover what he had swallowed were shocked to find an image of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants staring back at them.

Dr Ghofran Ageely, a radiology resident at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, said she screamed when reading the X-ray.

The 16-month-old hospital patient had been brought in because he appeared to have swallowed an object.

A 16-month-old toddler taken to hospital in Saudi Arabia, his parents fearing he had swallowed something, was found to have ingested a SpongeBob SquarePants pendant, owned by his sister

But medics were amazed to see the character, smiling and with his tongue sticking out, looking back at them from the image.

Dr Ageely told Livescience the rogue SpongeBob turned out to be a pendant, owned by the toddler's older sister.

She said the first X-ray captured an image of the child's side.

From it, Dr Ageely could see there was something - a thin object - lodged in the boy's oesophagus.

She suspected it was a pin or hair accessory.

'Then I opened the frontal view and was shocked, "SpongeBob", I screamed,' she said.

'I was amazed by the visible details, you can see his freckles, shoes and fingers.' 

The pendant was removed from the boy's throat and he was discharged to recover at home.

The images were later shared on a forum where radiologists and medical students discuss cases, including foreign bodies.

Dr Andrew Dixon, the managing editor of Radiopaedia, and a radiologist at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, said: 'We see a lot of amazing X-rays on our site, but this one is particularly amazing.'

He said the detail on the pendant was so clear because it was made up of tiny ridges in the metal's surface.
