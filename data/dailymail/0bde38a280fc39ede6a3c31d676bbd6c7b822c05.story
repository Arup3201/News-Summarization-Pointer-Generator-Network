Dr Luke has filed a defamation lawsuit against Kesha's lawyer Mark Geragos after the attorney accused the music producer of raping Lady Gaga.  

The Grammy-award nominated music whiz, real name Lukasz Gottwald, called the claims - which were also immediately denied by Gaga's representative - an 'outrageous' lie.

Geragos, who is representing Kesha in her sexual assault lawsuit against Dr Luke, made the allegations via Twitter after the singer told Howard Stern that she was raped by an older music producer at the age of 19.

He tweeted: 'Guess who the rapist was?' And when a fan asked if it was Dr Luke, he responded '#bingo.'

However, Dr Luke describes Geragos's comments as 'maliciously false' in court documents, according to TMZ.

He adds that he had not met Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta, at the time of the alleged rape nine years ago, and has never 'been alone with her or touched her.'

Indeed Geragos's tweets were also firmly denied by Gaga's camp. Her representative told TMZ, the allegations are 'absolutely not true' although refused to comment on the identity of the attacker. 

Her spokesman later added: 'The Dr. Luke lawsuit is utterly incomprehensible. This simply isn't true and how dare someone take advantage of such a sensitive matter.' 

At the time, Mr Geragos stood by his claims, telling TMZ: 'I said it because it's true'. He mentioned the allegations against Bill Cosby have 'now made others more courageous about coming out.'

The attorney also said he wants to depose Gaga in Kesha's lawsuit against Dr Luke, also telling TMZ that three other women 'not as famous'  claim to have similar experiences to Kesha and will be deposed as well.   

Back in October, Kesha filed a lawsuit for sexual assault and battery against Dr Luke - Since then, Kesha's mother Pebe Sebert has countersued Dr. Luke, claiming she suffered emotional distress and post traumatic stress disorder after the music producer allegedly raped her daughter.

Denial: Lady Gaga, pictured last week in New York, has denied that the man who raped her was Dr Luke

In legal documents obtained by TMZ, Sebert, 58, alleges Dr. Luke raped pop star Kesha, 27, in a way 'as not to be tolerated in a civilized society,' echoing her daughter's claims that the mogul drugged and abused her.

Dr. Luke, 41, has denied the claims made by the pair, and himself filed a lawsuit against Sebert in October claiming she orchestrated her daughter's rape claims against him to get the singer out of her recording contract. 

Meanwhile, Gaga found herself embroiled in the story after telling Howard Stern she was raped by a producer 20 years her senior, adding she 'went through some horrific things' when she was 19 and relied on 'a lot of mental and physical therapy' to help her to heal. 

Opening up: Gaga was interviewed by Howard Stern last week

When asked about the rape she said: 'I went through some horrific things that I'm able to laugh [at] now, because I've gone through a lot of mental and physical therapy and emotional therapy to heal over the years. 

'My music's been wonderful for me. But, you know, I was a shell of my former self at one point. I was not myself. 

'To be fair, I was about 19. I went to Catholic school and then all this crazy stuff happened, and I was going, "Oh, is this just the way adults are?'...I was very naive."'

Asked if she had ever confronted the rapist, who was 20 years older than her, she said: 'I think it would terrify me. It would paralyse me.

As she was: Gaga, real name Stefani Germanotta, on an MTV show back in 2005, when she would have been about 19 - it was around this time that she was attacked

'I saw him one time in a store and I was so paralysed by fear. Because it wasn't until I was a little bit older that I went, "Wow, that was really messed up."'#

The blonde beauty, who is dating actor Taylor Kinney, didn't tell anybody about the incident at the time, but eventually decided to seek help.

She said: 'I don't know what I was thinking. I didn't tell anybody. 

'And I didn't even tell myself for the longest time. And then I was like, "You know what? All this drinking and all this nonsense, you have to go to the source, otherwise it just won't go away. It will not go away."'
