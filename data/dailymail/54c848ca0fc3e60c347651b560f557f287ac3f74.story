David Cameron savaged Labour today for its failure to condemn the huge upcoming public sector strike after it emerged almost 90 per cent of the party's funding now comes from unions.

Civil servants, teachers and health workers are set to walk out on November 30 in a dispute over pensions.

During a lively Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons today, Mr Cameron brandished figures which show the Labour Party received £3,138,443 from unions.

He said: 'It really is irresponsible when negotiations are ongoing call strikes that will lead to the closure of most of the classrooms in this country.'

He described the pension deal offered to public sector workers as 'extremely reasonable' and added: 'It's not just the union leaders who don't understand this but the party opposite who refuse to condemn this strike.'

Referring to Ed Miliband, he said: 'In his first year as leader, 86 per cent of Labour's funding came from unions. Under the last Labour it was 50 per cent.

'That's the only thing he has improved since the time of Gordon Brown.'

Mr Miliband also attacked David Cameron for youth unemployment figures that were shown to have hit one million last week, saying he was 'playing politics' with the figures.

However, Mr Cameron said youth unemployment had been rising since 2004 and had risen by 40 per cent under the last government.

Labour outstripped the Tories in party fundraising over the summer by nearly 30 per cent, official figures released today show.

Donations registered with the Electoral Commission between July and September totalled £3,529,270 for the Opposition compared with the Conservatives' £2,744,618.

The third-largest income during the period was recorded by the Scottish National Party, which received £1,988,657, the commission said.

It comes a day after the main Westminster parties united to oppose extra state funding for parties as part of a bid to end the reliance on a few wealthy donors.

The Commission's figures showed that taxpayers underwrote political parties to the tune of just under £2.1million in the quarter.

Almost 90 per cent of the Labour total - £3,138,443 - came from the unions. That figure is certain to fuel Tory claims that the party is overly influenced by the sector.

A Labour spokesman said that its biggest single source of income was membership subscriptions and small donations below the threshold requiring declaration to the commission.

The three main parties also came under fire from the watchdog for late reporting of some of their donations - with the Tories and Liberal Democrats also censured over loans reporting.

Outstanding loans now totalled £14,789,996, the Commission said.

The biggest single donation was £1,493,317 given to Labour by the Unite trade union - with Unison giving another £731,299.

Coffers at the SNP were swelled by a surprise gift of nearly £1 million left to it in the will of former national poet Edwin Morgan, who died last year, and another £1 million from Europe's biggest lottery winners, Colin and Chris Weir.

The Tories did not bring in any mega-donations during the period - the biggest being a £258,500 boost from Peter Cruddas.

Their coalition partners the Liberal Democrats accepted £580,272 from the Methuen Liberal Trust Fund as part of its £1,199,623 total.

Labour presently owes almost £10 million in loans, the figures show, compared with £2.7 million for the Tories.
