The global takeover of Cath Kidston seems near completion as the brand's largest store to date opened in the heart of London on Thursday.

At 9.30am this morning the doors officially swung open to a vast multi-floored world where shoppers can be fully submerged in the trademark floral and twee patterns that have taken over living rooms, bedrooms and kitchens across the world. 

As hundreds queued in the cold to be one of the first to enter the store, the designer herself was on hand, serving customers eager to snap up some of her iconic ranges.

Originally the fare of the 'yummy-mummy' and viewed as distinctly middle class, Cath Kidson's simple and quaint designs have now infiltrated British culture

Inside, each room reveals more dainty floral printed items than one could ever fathom, from oven gloves, bags and notebooks to clothes for both adults and children

The new 7,070 square feet store brings the total number of UK stores to 68, with 75 International stores.

Over 20,000 products are displayed in the flagship store across three floors including home, accessories, fashion and kids.  New ranges include the Cath Kidston bespoke furniture upholstery service and the exclusive hand-drawn Piccadilly Print range.

Started by Cath Kidston herself 20 years ago, the new mega-store’s position opposite the Royal Academy, adjacent to The Ritz and Fortnum and Masons, shows just how far the business has come

The launch was marked with a huge Christmas present, which ‘exploded’ in Marble Arch to reveal two Cath Kidston taxis leading a convoy of eight to the new shop. The taxis will drop Londoners at the store for free in the run up to Christmas.

Originally the fare of the ‘yummy-mummy’ and viewed as distinctly middle class, Cath Kidston’s simple and quaint designs have now infiltrated British culture, with six mugs selling every two minutes in the UK.

The brand has also become synonymous with ‘Britishness’ across the globe, and while UK sales  were up by 21 per cent this year, international sales (there are 33 shops in Japan alone, with 8 more stores to open around Asia before Christmas) rose by an astonishing 53 per cent.

Cath said: 'We are so excited about opening the London flagship today and delighted that we have found this perfect landmark site in Piccadilly. It fits our brand perfectly. It was really lovely to be at the store this morning and chat to all our customers queuing up to see our exciting new store – some of them were even there from 4am.

'It was fun to be behind the counter again and wrapping everyone's Christmas gifts – it felt very nostalgic.'
