An Adelaide newsreader was forced to endure one of television's most awkward on-air moments when the autocue on his live news report went blank.

Left completely to his own devices, Channel 10 sports presenter Nick Butler was forced to improvise through the duration of the two-minute Monday night edition of Channel 10's Eyewitness news.

The Adelaide presenter  began by haphazardly stumbling through a wrap of the Commonwealth Games medal tally, before butchering a prerecorded cross to Australian cricket selector Rod Marsh.

After a couple of messy references to some Australian cricketers, the camera then awkwardly panned back to co-anchor Rebecca Morse who was looking less than amused by Butler's bumbling antics.

Her arms crossed and eyes looking to the sky, it gave Butler all but two seconds to regain some composure - only to spend the next 20 seconds painfully searching for the correct script to his next story.

It lead to yet another fax-paus, when he awkwardly crossed to a professional surfing tournament he thought was going to be golf.

The women's pro-surfing event at Huntington Beach California was the final segment, before the pair went to a break joking that his on-air performance was worse then their two football side's results at the weekend.

Rebecca, who endured the broadcast relatively unscathed, later laughed-off the autocue disaster on her Instagram account by uploading a photo of herself and Nick with the caption 'And that is what you might like to call an unmitigated disaster.'
