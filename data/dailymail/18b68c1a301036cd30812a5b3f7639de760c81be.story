A strike at Madrid’s main airport was causing half-term travel misery for British tourists yesterday.

More than 400 flights have been cancelled and 70,000 passengers affected by the action which is to last five days.

Workers were demonstrating at the Barajas airport over job losses at Iberia, the Spanish national airline that merged with British Airways in 2011.

Engines off: More than 80 Iberia flights were cancelled on Monday as workers at the carrier began the series of strikes that is expected to cost the airline and struggling national economy millions of euros in lost business

Eerie: Taxis queue outside the airport waiting 
for passengers to return to Madrid's main airport. But inside, the airport was eerily quiet as 
most passengers had been rescheduled

Protesters waved Spanish flags and 
banners saying ‘British go home’ and ‘No to layoffs in Iberia, stop the 
British colonisation’. They blame the London-based board of the combined
company – IAG – for a feared cull of 3,800 employees.

Bosses are also planning to cut most salaries.

Outside the terminal, police beat some strikers with truncheons and made two arrests.

Ten per cent of long-haul flights and
half of domestic services will be grounded this week. Queues formed as 
some staff abandoned their jobs at check-in desks.

An estimated 86 per cent of 
passengers have been given different flights, including those operated 
by other airlines and the remainder given refunds.

Iberia reported a loss of £220million in the first nine months of 2012.

In 2010, 49.8million passengers used Barajas.

The strike, due to last from February 18
to February 22, will hit British travellers particularly hard as it 
coincides with school holidays in Britain, Spain's biggest source of 
tourists.

In
anticipation of the strike, Iberia had already canceled 415 flights 
between Monday and Friday, and as many as 1,200 flights operated by 
various airlines will be disrupted because of the lack of handling 
services at Spanish airports.

But much of the anger is aimed at Britain. British Airways merged with Iberia in 2011 to form the International Airlines Group before reporting a loss of 262 million euros (£226 million) in the first nine
months of 2012.

The airline argues restructuring is 
vital to return the Spanish unit to profitability while unions say the 
IAG management is degrading pay and benefits in Spain through its 
low-cost airline Iberia Express.

Staff, including baggage handlers and air stewards, are holding three five-day strikes in February and March to protest management plans to axe jobs and cut salaries at the loss-making airline. Some 10 percent of long-haul flights and half of domestic flights will be grounded this week.

The labour unions kicked off the demonstrations in the morning with an 8 km-march (5 miles) around Barajas, telling reporters the airline was under threat, as was the future of the airport.

'Nobody is safe from being sacked,' said Elias Gonzalez, a maintenance supervisor at the protest who has worked for Iberia for 27 years.

The leaders of the European Parliament are threatening to veto the bloc's multi-annual budget because of its deep cuts.

The Christian Democratic EPP, the largest group in the legislature, said the seven-year budget worth £830 billion must be revised to realistically reflect the EU's growing competences and responsibilities.

Socialist leader Hannes Swoboda called the budget - which needs parliament's approval - unacceptable and said there won't be a majority for the proposed plan.

The EU's 27 member states earlier this month agreed on a budget deal that foresees the first cuts in the bloc's history for the years 2014-2020.

EU President Herman Van Rompuy defended the plan as shifting funds toward growth-friendly investment while recognizing the need to tighten belts currently felt across Europe.

'There was an initial deal with the company when the merger with the British was agreed, but now there is disagreement.'

Although skeleton staff were on duty and the airline had rescheduled most passengers or returned them their money, some people were left stranded.

'When we come for tourism, we don't 
want to be bothered by strikes,' said Robert, a French tourist who did 
not want to give his last name.

'Everyone has their problems but they shouldn't bother people who bring in money. That's also business.'

Queues formed as some staff abandoned check-in desks while unionists shouted in the airport.

Tourism
accounts for around 11 percent of Spanish economic output and is one of
the country's few growth sectors in a prolonged recession that has 
pushed the unemployment rate above 26 percent.

Some 70,000 passengers will be 
affected by this week's strike. About 86 percent have been given a different flights, 
including those operated by other airlines, while 14 percent had asked 
for refunds.

The airline says restructuring is 
vital to return the Spanish unit to profitability while unions say the 
IAG management is degrading pay and benefits in Spain through its new 
low-cost airline Iberia Express.

Iberia is just one of several companies in Spain, including Vodafone and bailed-out lender Bankia, to lay off workers.

It is fighting an uphill battle against low-cost operators, a depressed domestic economy and competitors that are in better shape after having already gone through restructuring processes.

Sabadell Bolsa analysts said the total 15 days of strikes could cost Iberia between 50 million euros and 100 million euros of losses.
