Many of us splash out on our loved ones at this time of year and Emmie Stevens is no different, lavishing gifts, treats and new clothes ... on her 12 dogs.

The self-confessed ‘mad dog lady’ will spend Christmas Day opening 12 stockings full of gifts for her ‘fur babies’.

The pets will sit down to a dinner of turkey and all the trimmings, pull crackers, wear fancy dress outfits and even go for rides in a doggy sleigh.

Miss Stevens, 26, plans to spend £1,000 on her dogs this Christmas – but just £200 on her boyfriend Barry Stears, 32, saying that the dogs come first.

This, after all, is a woman who in the past five years has spent £40,000 on her dogs, including manicures, fur dyes, perfume, prams and jewellery.

She said yesterday: ‘You spoil your children, don’t you? My dogs are basically my babies and everyone spends a lot on their children at Christmas.

‘It might be a waste in some people’s eyes but people drink excessively over Christmas and that’s a waste in my opinion.’

The dogs that share her home in Croydon, South London, are Staffordshires Nelly and Bailey; poodles Purdy, Dolly and Pixi; jackadoodles (half Jack Russell, half poodle) Muffin, Bambi, Sparkle and Doodles; Chinese crested Cabbie; chihuahua cross Minnie; and a pomeranian called Pomie.

Miss Stevens, who owns a dog grooming business, will spend £550 on presents, £150 on decorations, £100 on food and £200 on clothes.

‘I love no one more than my dogs,’ she said. ‘They have their own stockings full of presents and they’ll have their own dinners.

‘My plan is to dress Bailey as a reindeer and he can pull the sleigh with the little dogs in the back. I’m going to dress the dogs as Mr and Mrs Claus, a snowman, reindeers, and a Christmas pudding.

‘I have a huge bag stuffed full of dog presents like toys and balls and tons of treats and bones – and some necklaces for the little dogs.’

Despite being human, boyfriend Barry won’t get off lightly. ‘I’ll be dressing up as Mrs Claus and Barry will be Santa,’ said Miss Stevens. ‘I love getting dressed up to match my dogs and Barry does it to make me happy.’

Her living room will be turned into a canine grotto. She said: ‘I’ve bought a 6ft tree and I’ll decorate it all with doggy stuff. I have personalised my own decorative bones with their names to hang from the tree and I’ll lay the table for them to enjoy their Christmas meal. 

'They’ll all have a bit of turkey, a roast potato, a Yorkshire pudding, a pig in blanket, and a bit of veg. For dessert I’m going to get some vanilla ice cream and stick a little bone in each bowl.’

Miss Stevens, who said her love of dogs began when she was 19 and rescued Doodles from a puppy farm, added: ‘They make me so happy, I just can’t help but spoil them.’
