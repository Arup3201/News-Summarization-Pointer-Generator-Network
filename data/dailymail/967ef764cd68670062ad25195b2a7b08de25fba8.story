There will come a time, hopefully soon, when Jose Mourinho accepts that the role of the television analysts and newspaper columnists is to pass comment on key decisions.

Here at Stamford Bridge there were four moments - minute 18, minute 23, minute 46 and minute 56, as Mourinho refers to them - that affected the direction of this game.

‘Pundits are pundits and managers are managers,’ explained Chelsea’s manager after his team had been held to a 1-1 draw by an engaging and adventurous Southampton team at Stamford Bridge.

Jose Mourinho may one day accept that the role of pundits is to pass comment on key decisions

Yet again, after Mourinho's Chelsea drew with Southampton, Mourinho attacked his critics

‘Pundits are paid to wear my suit, but I’m not paid to wear their suit or comment on their comments.

‘If one day I become a pundit I will wear a manager’s suit and win every game because that’s what pundits do. I can be phenomenal, like they are.’ 

He really has a bee in his bonnet over the role of Graeme Souness or Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, gravely offended that anyone could dare to criticise his tactics or his team. And so it goes on.

This is Yawnsville and as unappealing as this will sound to Chelsea’s manager, the match officials are also tiring of his constant complaints.

Here Mike Dean, the latest poor sap given the onerous duty of refereeing the Barclays Premier League leaders, was pretty much spot on. He made honest decisions for heaven’s sake, not judgments designed to haul Manchester City, Arsenal or Manchester United back into the title race. 

Referee Mike Dean was lumped with taking charge of Chelsea and on key decisions was pretty much spot on

Dean awarded this penalty to Southampton, scored by Dusan Tadic, which didn't please Mourinho

Chelsea were a goal to the good through Diego Costa when Mourinho’s faithful servant Rui Faria was sent down the tunnel to watch the television replay of the decision to award Southampton a penalty when Nemanja Matic fouled Sadio Mane.

A few days ago, in the boisterous atmosphere of the second leg of their Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea’s players were guilty of kettling Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off.

Here they largely kept their cool, with captain John Terry the only player in a blue shirt to contest the decision to award Saints the chance to level.

‘My view is not important because what is important is the referee’s view,’ claimed Mourinho. In any event, Dusan Tadic equalised. 

Diego Costa appeals for a penalty that would have seen Jose Fonte sent off had it been awarded

The biggest bone of contention was the failure of Dean to spot the delicate tap on Branislav Ivanovic inside the penalty area when Southampton’s goalscorer Tadic flicked out a boot.

‘Graeme Souness says it’s worse if a player asks for a yellow card than if a player kicks someone in the chest — that’s what he says — so my opinion is not opinion. What is important is Mr Mike Dean and his decision was no penalty on Ivanovic.’

There was, to Mourinho’s credit, a weary sigh when he was asked whether the decision to replace the sluggish figure of Matic with Ramires was to avoid an inevitable dismissal.

Matic was booked in the first half for his challenge on Mane and should have been sent off when he clattered into Southampton’s deep-lying forward in the 46th minute. As ever, there was a sting in the tail. 

Fonte calls for Branislav Ivanovic to be booked for a dive but replays showed he been clipped by Tadic

‘When that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow would come,’ admitted a doleful Mourinho.

‘With fast players like Mane coming out of midfield, driving the ball, that could happen. If you remember Ramires’ red card against Villa, obviously you are afraid of it.’

It is these comments, designed to twist the knife, that get people’s goat. There is no agenda and no-one is out to get Chelsea.

As for the 56th-minute incident when Southampton captain Jose Fonte tackled Costa, you can make a case for either.

‘You have to control me here...’ claimed Mourinho. 

Matic was booked for the foul that gave away the penalty and should have got a second and sent off later on

He made no mention of Costa’s reaction — shoving Fonte in the chest as the pair waited for a corner kick to be taken in front of the Matthew Harding Stand.

‘Sky told me their pundits said it was a penalty, then I went to BBC and they said it wasn’t a penalty,’ he said. ‘I went to do the radio and they said it wasn’t. Now I come here and I think you’re saying it’s not a penalty. I’m not jumping with happiness and not crying with disappointment.’

Instead, it was just more of the same.
