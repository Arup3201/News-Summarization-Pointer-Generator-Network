Parisian women have always been known for their ability to look chic under any circumstances. 

As well as their sophisticated diet and their relaxed attitude to life, the women of the French capital have a few key rules to dressing that mean they nail it every time.

Natalie Portman, who is married to the French dancer and choreographer Benjamin Millepied, revealed one of the key style points in an interview this weekend that has previously been unknown by many - that Parisian women don't wear shorts.

Natalie Portman, 33, who married a Frenchman, says that Parisians would never wear shorts in the city

She told the Wisconsin Gazette: 'The city is so rich in terms of the architecture, the bookshops you find at every corner, the way everyone dresses so well. 

'No Parisian ever walks around in shorts and even the children look very chic.'

Parisians haven't just abolished shorts, they also steer clear of high heels, matching accessories and would never, ever been seen in a pair of tracksuit bottoms.

Embrace black 

Black is the overwhelming shade in every Parisian woman's wardrobe. 

It is key to make sure that you appear effortless and to guarantee that your clothes won't clash. 

Lay off the accessories 

While British women are all about quantity, the French are the opposite - jewellery is understated. 

Avoid piling it on too - as Coco Chanel once said: 'Before leaving the house, a lady should look in the mirror and remove one accessory.'

Invest in some scarves 

When it comes to scarves, the accessory rule does not apply. 

Parisian women love scarves and sometimes even wear two at a time by twisting them together.  

Don't try too hard 

Parisian women are polished but never let it show. 

Their messy hair, often un-tucked shirts and barely-there make-up are all part of a conscious effort to look as though they have given little thought to their appearance.

Invest in wardrobe staples 

There are some basic items of clothing that feature in every Parisian woman's wardrobe. 

They include a white shirt, a black leather jacket, a little back dress, a fitted blazer, a black pencil skirt and a pair of cigarette pants. 

These are then worn for years and adapted to changing figures using a seamstress, unlike British women, who would head out and buy the item in a different size. 

The items can be made to look different and more modern by pairing them with on-trend accessories. 

Don't be too matchy matchy 

Unless we're talking about black. 

French women don't match their accessories - shoes can be a different texture and even a different colour to a belt or a handbag.

Learn to love flats 

French women love flat shoes. 

They will wear heels in the evening, but during the day they wear ballet pumps , moccasins or biker boots. 

A woman who is hobbling in her heels will look unglamourous no matter how hard she has tried.

Try out masculine tailoring 

Women like Lou Doillon always look effortlessly chic in their masculine tailoring. 

The emphasis is on clean lines and a clean silhouette.
