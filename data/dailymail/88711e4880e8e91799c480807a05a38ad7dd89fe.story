Toys worth thousands of pounds donated to sick children at Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital have been stolen.

Gadgets and goods including a Nintendo Wii, iPads, board games, phones, shoes, and cash were taken from Britain’s largest hospital for unwell children.

Last year staff made 70 stolen property reports, out of almost 200 theft reports since 2011.

Among the items taken by thieves were baby toys and gadgets that children who are bed-ridden could play, including a PSP games console, portable DVD players and a Kindle e-reader. Baby toys were also stolen, as well as a web cam to enable patients to talk to their relatives online.

Important medical equipment was also taken including incubator covers, a microscope adapter, a carer bed and a hospital trolley. Even a baby buggy, therapeutic aids, and nurses’ uniforms were stolen, a Freedom of Information request shows.

A spokeswoman for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘Our hospital is a busy public space with hundreds of visitors every day and, like many public areas in London, opportunist thefts of personal items sometimes occur.

‘We work closely with the police to carry out reviews and improve security, and all staff receive training to remind them of the importance of remaining vigilant and ensuring both their own items and those of our patients and families are kept safe and secure.

‘We are also continuing to expand our CCTV network and operate a robust security presence within public areas of the hospital.’

Criminals caused outrage in 2012 when Christmas presents for children in intensive care were stolen. No one was ever caught.

In many cases police gave the hospital, in Central London, crime prevention advice and in 15 cases improvements were made to security measures.

Great Ormond Street is not the only hospital to be targeted by thieves in recent years. In March a bank card was stolen from a dying man in Blackpool Victoria Hospital. The criminals stole £1,000 and used the card to buy a 32-inch television.

In January an elderly patient had her handbag stolen as she lay unconscious in bed at York Hospital. Brenda Scott, 74, was struggling to breathe when her bag containing her purse and jewellery disappeared.

In October last year former hospital worker Emma Walker and her husband Paul pleaded guilty to setting up a £30,000 online business selling medical equipment taken from Salford Royal Hospital.
