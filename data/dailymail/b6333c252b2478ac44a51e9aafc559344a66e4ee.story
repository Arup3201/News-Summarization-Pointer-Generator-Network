I don't think I will shock anyone when I predict Germany will win by two goals. They have been played with confidence and mastery - clinical and composed.

Argentina have barely got over the line. They simply haven't been exhilarating at any point and with no team pattern of play, they're a bit like Brazil in that respect.

When they come up against a well-drilled Germany team, it is going to be tough.

Disappointing: Argentina haven't been exhilarating at any point and with no team pattern of play

What Argentina must do to win

1 They need to play to win. So far they have played to not get beaten - that won't win you a World Cup.

2 They need to keep the ball. If Germany don't have it, they can't score, and if Argentina have the ball, they can.

3 Lionel Messi is the player who can win this for them but his team-mates need to give him the ball much higher up the pitch than they have been. He needs to be receiving the ball in the final third so he hasn't got a long way to get to the goal. Germany are going to be watching Messi like a hawk. Get the ball to him when he's as close to the German goal as possible, then let him do his magic â€¦ that's the best chance they've got.

Plan: If Argentina have the ball, Germany need to crowd Lionel Messi out of the game like Holland did

What Germany must do to win.

1 
Germany need to keep possession. Basically, their task is to keep the 
ball away from Messi, and the simplest way to do this is to keep hold of
 the ball. If Argentina don't have the ball, they can't pass it to 
Messi.

2
 If Argentina have the ball, Germany need to crowd Messi out of the game
 like Holland did in their semi-final. Pour pressure on to him, and 
don't leave any holes in the midfield - Messi gets through those gaps.

3
 They need to play with the same positivity as they have throughout this
 tournament. If Joachim Low's team go forward and play to win like they 
did against Brazil, they will be very difficult to beat

Don't give Germany an inch

Argentina have to keep their back four tight and not allow big spaces between them and midfield (shaded area).

Brazil were punished when Germany got in that space and players made great runs to create the space for the guy with the ball to hit the killer pass or shoot.
