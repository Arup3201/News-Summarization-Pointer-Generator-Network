Model, actress…computer programmer? It’s not your average career trajectory, but Lyndsey Scott's not your average girl.

The Victoria's Secret model is keen to prove that she is both beauty and brains and has even designed an app called 'Code Made Cool' to encourage other young girls to follow in her footsteps.

The U.S.-born 
29-year-old has walked in runway shows for Prada and Louis Vuitton, 
while simultaneously developing seven phone apps - two of which have 
been picked up by Apple.

Cover girl: Victoria's Secret model Lyndsey Scott has designed an app she hopes will 'make coding cool' as she smoulders in a new ASOS shoot

The young entrepreneur is the star of ASOS magazine's May 2014 issue and discusses her double life. She says: 'I have trouble endorsing modelling as a career…I love it so much but you basically have to be a genetic freak in order to do it and most people aren’t.

'Some of the most beautiful girls I’ve ever seen in my life don’t get lucky. It’s the sort of career where you have absolutely no control, whereas you have complete control with programming, which I really appreciate.'

In celebration of all things tech, Lyndsey has created Code Made Cool - a coding game she built herself where ASOS app users can follow the instructions and 
create fun, fantasy scenarios with heartthrob Ryan Gosling.

Getting technical: Lyndsey has created Code Made Cool - a coding game she built herself for ASOS

Lyndsey is proud of her tech wizardry but hopes people won't judge her. 'People are so quick to attach stereotypes to this sort of profession,' she said.

'I'm fine with being called a geek or a nerd if that means I'm smart, but there is a negative connotation to that sort of word and there's an assumption about who you are as a person if you like technology.

'Perhaps if there wasn’t, we’d get more women interested.'

Big gig: Scott got her big break in 2009 when she became the first-ever African American to get an exclusive runway contract with Calvin Klein

Digital babe: Lyndsey Scott, who appeared in the 2009 Victoria's Secret show, leads a double life as a computer programmer

Ms Scott attended Amherst, a prestigious
liberal arts college in Massachusetts, graduating in 2006 with a 
double-degree in theatre and computer science.

Despite
 her parents’ pressure to pursue computers, she focused her energies 
on modeling - receiving her big break in 2009 when she became the 
first-ever African American to get an exclusive runway contract with 
Calvin Klein (a label that has previously endured criticism for its 
preference for Caucasian models).

Later that year, she walked the 
Victoria’s Secret runway in the show's PINK segment and was also cast in
 presentations by Prada and Louis Vuitton.

Her brother Matthew Scott sums her up as a mixture of "Gisele Bundchen and Bill Gates".

'I 
can’t imagine those two combined, but if they did, it would probably by 
Lyndsey,’ he said.
