England intend to tap into Jonny Wilkinson’s expertise and experience after he retires at the end of this season – and the iconic fly-half is keen to take on a coaching role with the national team.

Toulon’s 34-year-old playmaker confirmed on Monday that he will end his playing career when the current campaign is over – leading to a torrent of tributes to his record-breaking achievements at Test and club level. And the man whose drop goal famously clinched the 2003 World Cup for Sir Clive Woodward’s England side expressed a desire to represent his country again one day, in a management or mentoring capacity.

‘Never say never,’ said Wilkinson,’ when asked about plans to go into coaching. ‘If I can help make a difference – even if it’s only a small percentage – then I would love to do that. With England? Of course, that would be amazing, but at the same time if I can work with just one person and have a positive effect, that’s good enough to begin with.

‘It’s
 a real desire of mine, having played with so many people who have 
helped me in my career. I just want to help others get better. I would 
love to have an opportunity to work on a one-to-one, skills basis and 
hopefully have an effect. That’s where I’d love to spend my time in 
rugby, certainly initially.’ England head coach Stuart Lancaster greeted
 the news of Wilkinson’s imminent retirement by indicating that he will 
aim to involve him with the national squad in some capacity. The 
prospect of the legendary No 10 – well known for his uber-professional 
approach – being brought in prior to the home World Cup next year 
appears remote, but it may not be long before he is seen in a Red Rose 
tracksuit again.

Asked if he
 would approach Wilkinson about mentoring work with England, Lancaster 
said: ‘I wouldn’t rule it out long-term, whether it was working with 
age-grade teams or certain individuals. When you’ve got someone of his 
calibre and experience, with such a clear influence on so many people, I
 would certainly want him to feel part of the England team.

‘I’m
 sure in the right place, at the right time, we’ll invite him into camp 
and he will be more than welcome to pass on some of that (experience and
 knowledge) to the current coaching team, or directly to senior players 
or age-grade players as well. I think it would be incredible what he 
could offer young players and senior players too.’

Meanwhile, Lancaster expects Harlequins full back Mike Brown, who suffered a hip injury against Saracens last Saturday, to be fit for the first Test against New Zealand on June 7 though hooker Dylan Hartley, who has a shoulder injury, is still struggling.

Saracens winger Chris Ashton has been let off with a warning by the RFU after a probe into the incident where he ran at Quins’ Nick Evans shouting ‘miss, miss’ as the fly-half took a kick at goal.
