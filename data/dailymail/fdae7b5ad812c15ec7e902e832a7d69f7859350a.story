New research shows that taking statins could reduce the risk of painful arthritis

Taking cholesterol-lowering statins every day could more than halve the chances of getting arthritis, according to a new study.

Researchers at Keele University carried out the 
research on the back of growing evidence that arthritis is not just down to 
wear and tear as the body ages  - but also inflammation in the joints.

The study of more than 16,000 adults 
found that people on the highest doses of statins – 18.5mg or more a day
– had 60 per cent lower osteoarthritis rates than people not taking the
drugs.

As well as lowering cholesterol, statins have an anti-inflammatory effect, and are taken by eight million people to ward off strokes or heart attacks.

They are also thought to protect against cancer 
and Alzheimer’s and ease the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and
protect diabetes sufferers against heart disease.

Keele university’s Health Services Research Unit, which is funded by Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, found that people on very low doses seemed to be at higher risk of arthritis than patients not taking statins.

The study, Statin Use and Clinical Osteoarthritis in the General Population:A Longitudinal Study, which is published in the Journal of General and Internal Medicine, said the findings suggest the condition may be more closely linked to heart disease than first thought.

'Our work has shown that the risk factors for cardiovascular disease are also associated with osteoarthritis,' said researchers.

'The co-occurrence of osteoarthritis and cardiovascular disease is common.'

A spokeswoman for Arthritis Research UK 
said: 'We welcome this study as it contributes to the idea that osteoarthritis (OA) in not simply wear and tear as we get older, and that in the future drug treatments can offer hope to people with OA.'

Research suggests that arthritis may be more closely linked to heart disease than first thought

'OA is an active disease that includes inflammation and active damage to the joint.

'The concept that OA is caused by the way that our body processes lipids is not proven, but this study provides some intriguing data to suggest that this warrants further work.

'Arthritis Research UK is committed to finding the causes of OA, new therapies for OA as well as treatments, such as pain relief, that help to manage the symptoms of OA.

'For example, we are funding  a trial to investigate whether a drug called hydroxychloroquinone, commonly used to reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, is also effective for people living with OA.'

Scientists believe that inflammation plays a larger role in osteoarthritis than first thought.

They are investigating whether drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis, which occurs when the immune system attacks the joints, can also help in osteoarthritis.

Around 10 million Britons suffer from arthritis.

The charity Arthritis Care estimates the number of patients will rise to 17 million in the next 20 years.
