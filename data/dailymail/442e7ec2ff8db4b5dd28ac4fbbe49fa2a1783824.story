Bad doctor: Ex-pediatrician Richard Keller, 57, was sentenced today to six-and-a-half years in prison after authorities found over 100 child pornography DVDs in his possession

A former pediatrician teared up in court today as he was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison after more than 100 child pornography DVDs and 500 similar images were found at his home.

Authorities busted 57-year-old Richard Keller in September 2012, after investigating a Toronto, Canada-based film company that sold $2,695 worth of child porn titles to the pediatrician.

In addition to working at Boston Children's Hospital and as an educator at Harvard University, Keller worked as the medical director of prestigious prep school Phillips Academy for nearly two decades.

Keller even had some of the child pornography DVDs sent to him at the academy's student health center.

The former doctor was given the chance to speak at his sentencing hearing on Wednesday, and he expressed how 'embarrassed' he was for himself, his friends and his family.

'The hypocrisy of my behavior is not lost on me, for I betrayed a public trust,' he said.

Keller admitted to living in a 'heinous and vile subculture' but that he wanted to turn his life around by acting as an advocate for the poor and disenfranchised.

'Please know I have done much good in my life, and I have a good heart,' he said.

His lawyer, Max Stern, stressed that Keller did not want to minimize the seriousness of his crimes.

'He has had a tortured existence, an agonizing existence,' Stern said. 'He calls it a tumor. ... Now he is free to face his demons.'

Keller, who is still in a romantic relationship with a woman and has a 2-year-old child, pleaded guilty last November to charges of receiving and possessing pornography depicting boys between the ages of 7 and 16.

Before he was charged with child pornography possession in September 2012, Keller was working as a doctor at Boston Children's Hospital. And before that, he spent nearly two decades as the medical director at prestigious prep school Phillips Academy

Some of those videos were sent to him at his office at Phillips Academy, where he resigned after 19 years in April 2011 when the school decided not to renew his contract.

In an email to students and parents following Keller's arrest, headmaster John Palfrey wrote that Keller had been dismissed because of professional misconduct that didn't have anything to do with the child porn case.

Palfrey relayed that Keller was caught using school computers to access adult porn in 1999, and that he showed an inappropriate cartoon to students in 2002, but that there is no reason to believe students were abused by Keller.

Keller voluntarily surrendered his medical license after his arrest.

He now faces a minimum of five years and three months in prison, and a maximum of six-and-a-half years.

In addition to his prison time, Keller will be on probation for an additional five-and-a-half years after his release and have to pay a $10,000 fine.

He has also been ordered to undergo counseling and stay away from children without an adult present.Â
