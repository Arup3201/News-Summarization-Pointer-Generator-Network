Crime: A murder inquiry is underway after a 16-year-old, named locally as Ajmol Alom, was stabbed to death

A gifted pupil who was tipped to study medicine at Oxbridge was stabbed to death as he tried to protect a friend from a masked gang.

Ajmol Alom collapsed yards from his home after a teenage gangster plunged a knife into his leg in an unprovoked attack on Monday night.

The 16-year-old, who is expected to get a string of A*s in his GCSEs when his results are published next week, was chatting with friends when the gang approached.

Wearing hoodies and bandanas, the six-strong gang attacked one of Ajmol’s friends, stabbing him through the cheek.

When Ajmol tried to intervene, he was stabbed twice in his thigh on the housing estate in Poplar, East London, where he lived. His tearful mother Rohima Khaun ran out of the family home and watched in horror while locals tried to save her son.

Paramedics arrived minutes later but were unable to save him. He died hours later in hospital. His friend is still being treated and is expected to make a full recovery.

Friends and neighbours yesterday said that Ajmol had been caught up in the latest tit-for-tat attack between rival gangs. They said Ajmol was not involved in any prior attack and was not a member of any gang.

His headmaster said Ajmol was ‘the last person you would think this would happen to’. Chris Dunne, of Langdon Park School, said: ‘His results will be out next week and I expect him to have got straight As.

Tragedy: Ajmol (pictured right on his school prom night) was found injured with his friend but despite being rushed to hospital could not be saved

‘He was planning to take four A-levels
 and I fully expected him to go to one of the Russell Group 
universities, possibly Oxford or Cambridge. He was thinking of taking 
medicine. He had a very bright academic future.

‘On a personal level, this is 
absolutely devastating news. He was such a kind and gentle young man and
 will be greatly missed, not just as a pupil but as a young man of 
outstanding promise.’

Weeks before his death Ajmol and his 
friends hired a Maserati GranTurismo convertible to take them to a 
farewell party from school.

Special: Ajmol Alom went to Derry City in Northern Ireland after being chosem as an peace envoy to promote inter-faith friendships

'Bright future': Ajmol was predicted to get top grades in his GCSEs on Thursday, but may have been caught up in a gang row

Ajmol, a keen sportsman, had just finished playing football and was sitting on a wall chatting with friends when he was stabbed.

Tribute: Ajmol Alom died last night and today teachers and friends spoke of a 'splendid young man' who did well at school

Residents heard him ‘howling’ in pain and ‘crying out for God’ as he lay bleeding on the floor.

Eyewitness Jahed Choudhury said: 
‘Ajmol was stabbed twice in the top of his leg next to his vein. There 
was blood coming out everywhere.

The ambulance took about 15 or 20 minutes to come.

‘I have spoken to his parents and they are very upset. His mother is taking his death particularly badly. She is hysterical.’

Ajmol, of Bengali heritage, lived in a
 second-floor flat with his father Jahangier Alom, who runs an Indian 
restaurant, his mother, two brothers aged 15 and ten and a five-year-old
 sister.

His best friend Najmol Chowdhury, 16, said Ajmol had never been in trouble before.

‘He was still wearing his football kit
 when they attacked him,’ Najmol said. ‘It must have been a case of 
mistaken identity because he did not have any enemies. He did not have 
any problems with other boys.’

Najmol said his friend was exceptionally smart and could have gone on to become anything he wanted.

‘He always got As and A*s,’ he said. 
‘He was waiting for his GCSE results but he had nothing to worry about.

He had already got an A in maths that he took last year and A*s in all 
the sciences – biology, physics and chemistry. He was in the top set for
 everything and he was a good sportsman as well.’

In shock: Police guard the street where the killing took place, and residents spoke of a 'nice' local boy who was stabbed to death last night

There has been a recent craze for hiring 'supercars' to celebrate school graduation days. These students, were pictured graduating from Swanlea School, Tower Hamlets. They are not believed to have any connection with the incident or with gangs

At school Ajmol had been selected to 
represent the borough of Tower Hamlets in a conflict resolution project 
with teenagers in Northern Ireland.

By all accounts he took this role 
seriously and wrote of the importance of ‘building bridges’ between 
multi-cultural communities so they can ‘live in harmony’.

He was a devout Muslim who prayed five times a day and attend his local mosque regularly.

Anyone who can help is asked to contact the incident room on 020 8358 0100 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
