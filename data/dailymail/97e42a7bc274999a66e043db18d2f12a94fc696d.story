Ian Holloway let rip at referee Stuart Attwell after Millwall slipped to a 1-0 Sky Bet Championship defeat at home to Bolton.

Darren Pratley struck the winner in the 68th minute to condemn the Lions to a third straight home loss.

But Lions boss Holloway was raging after Attwell turned down what appeared to be a clear penalty for his side - and what should have subsequently been a red card for Bolton goalkeeper Andy Lonergan - after he sent Lee Gregory flying in the area shortly after half-time.

Striker Gregory was through on goal and had touched the ball past the onrushing Lonergan before the pair collided, but Attwell bafflingly gave nothing.

And Den boss Holloway said: 'The biggest contentious issue of the whole game was very upsetting and very annoying.

'If that's not a foul then Gregory should have been booked for diving. It was clear to Bolton's bench, to be fair, they knew it should have been a penalty and down to 10 men, and that would have changed the complexion of the game.

'Do me a favour, book my man for diving or send their keeper off. Don't just play on!'

Wanderers manager Neil Lennon admitted his heart was in his mouth when Gregory hit the deck.

'It could easily have been given,' he said. 'Andy maintained Gregory has gone into him, but the referee had a decision to make and thankfully it went our way.

'I can understand Ian's frustration, we're both in same position. Maybe we've had a stroke of luck. I don't think the ref had a great game for either side.'

Millwall had the best two chances of the first half but Gregory and Angel Martinez fired both of them wide.

Bolton winger Hall was somehow denied a goal on the hour mark when his shot cannoned off the inside of the post, flew along the line and off Lions goalkeeper David Forde's leg before rolling to safety.

But Pratley struck in the 68th minute when he collected Lee Chung-Yong's fine pass, beat Danny Shittu on the edge of the area and arrowed his shot past Forde and into the net.

Martyn Woolford could have equalised with five minutes remaining but, to add to Millwall's frustration, Lonergan was out quickly to make a fine save.

It was only Bolton's second win on the road this season and lifted them up to 14th.

Lennon added: 'That's the best we've played away from home for a while. With the football we played and chances we created I thought we were good value for the win.'
