Designer Donna Karan has revealed how she managed to avoid falling prey to the stressful 'chaos' of living and working in New York City, while creating three globally-successful fashion labels.

In an interview with The New Potato, the 66-year-old admits that, while New York has helped to inspire and influence her clothing designs, the madness of city living can sometimes prove too much.

Speaking about her newly-launched clothing and accessories line Urban Zen, which is targeted at an older audience than her popular DKNY designs, Donna explains how she has slowed the pace of her own often-manic lifestyle and carved out her own peaceful sanctuary in the heart of New York.

'New York has been my inspiration,' she says.

'Because of the craziness of New York, I started Urban Zen to find the calm in the chaos of the city we live in and love. Being down here, in this loft at Urban Zen, is sort of an escape.'

The new line entirely different from her DKNY and Donna Karan collections, both of which have proved to be incredibly popular the world over.

But Urban Zen marks a move away from more mainstream fashion, in favor of comfortable, yet chic, styles which are as suitable for a yoga class as they would be for a dinner date, and are a clear reflection of Donna's low-key lifestyle.

'Anything that I don’t have to get dressed for, or put on make-up, I love,' she jokes.

When it comes to achieving the perfect lifestyle balance, Donna has learned to embrace those activities that she enjoys the most - specifically yoga and food. 

Building an urban sanctuary: The 66-year-old's newest label Urban Zen is targeted at a more 'yoga-minded' woman

'I get up every morning and have my protein drink from We Care,' she says. 'In the afternoon I have to have soup and salad, usually a green soup. I also like green juices. I love Italian food, especially Tutto il Giorno and Bar Pitti...

'I started doing yoga when I was eighteen years old, so I started at a very young age. It was something that I felt comfortable with. I love being on a mat; I love having a teacher; I love going inside, because I’m constantly outside.'

But while Donna has learned to find the perfect balance when it comes to city living, she suggests the ability can only come with years of experience, something which she feels is reflected in the attitudes and lifestyles of the different age groups each of her lines is targeted at.

Describing 'the Donna Karan woman' as someone who is constantly on the move, while working at an executive level position, Donna stresses that DKNY's customers tend to be more young, urban people who are 'constantly looking for jobs'.

When it comes to Urban Zen, the label's most devoted fans tend to be 'a little bit more yoga-minded' and bohemian, with a strong focus on body and movement.  

Speaking about her own lifestyle, Donna makes clear that she is leaning more towards the Urban Zen way of living, describing yoga, something which she has been doing since the age of 18, as one of her central focuses. 

Donna also stresses her love of nature and confesses that being close to an open, green space - in her case, a city park - helps her to find focus.  

'I live on the park, so in that sense, I make sure that I have nature around me,' she says. 'I have to be in nature, because if I’m not I get really nasty.'
