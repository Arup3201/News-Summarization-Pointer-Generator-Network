Hoping to live long and prosper Star Trek fanatics Jossie and Sonnie Gustavsson today tied the knot in the UK’s first-ever ‘Klingon’ wedding.

The bride, a Trekkie-convert who as a child dreamed of a white wedding, donned brown face-paint and a rubber mask to exchange vows.

And there was no need to beam up their 
guests after they carried out the ceremony in front of thousands of other sci-fi fans
at the UK's first Star Trek convention in more than a decade.

Organised by Superb Events Ltd it was faithful to the TV series meaning the sound of traditional Klingon drums replaced the more familiar wedding march as the pair took their place next to a three-metre statue of the Klingon god as the altar and giant flames.

Dressed in red and black ceremonial robes, the pair were married by celebrant Peter Wyllie in the language of Klingon, as bemused ‘Trekkies’ looked on.

Marrying the pair, Mr Wyllie said: 'Nobody can oppose the beating of two Klingon hearts.

'May the rest if your life be filled with your hearts beating as one.'

If that wasn't enough excitement for the pair on their big day the groom's Tawi'Yan, or best man to most, then presented the couple with a 
sword so they could commence a mock battle with each other in 
representation of the struggle of the male and female Klingon hearts 
against one another.

The pair then kissed before cutting a giant cake in the shape of the Borg Cube spacecraft.

The audience joined in a blessing of ‘yln’ [life], ‘bathlh’ [honour] and ‘qapla’ [success].

Jossie and Sonnie are both care workers for the elderly and the trip to London was the first holiday the couple have taken together.

They decided to marry at the convention, a celebration of the 25th anniversary of Star Trek the Next Generation, and were chosen out of many couples for the Klingon Wedding.

It is the first dedicated Star Trek event to hit the UK in over a decade, and arrives in London for three days from today until Sunday.
