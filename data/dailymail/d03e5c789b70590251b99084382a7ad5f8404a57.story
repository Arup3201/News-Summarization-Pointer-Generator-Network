A giant 25ft snake was beaten to death by Mexican villagers - who feared the creature was so big it could have swallowed a child.

Frightened residents also cut the head off the huge animal after it was spotted lying alongside a railway track.

Rail passengers raised the alarm after they saw the snake from their train as it pulled into the village of Benito Juarez, in a remote part of the southeast Mexican state of Tabasco.

Villagers, armed with sticks and one carrying a machete, ran back along the tracks where they found it attempting to slither away into the undergrowth.

Conservationist have criticised the killing and say those responsible could face charges.

But the villagers were unrepentant, saying they had a right to protect their livestock and themselves from the huge creature.

Local Nicandro Aguilar said: ‘I have never seen a snake that big, and it was clear that it was a danger to people as well is wild stock.

‘It could just as easily have swallowed down a child as a lamb or a calf. It was massive.’

The snake was found in the village of Benito Juarez in the southeast of Mexico

Others blamed the snake, which had apparently been living in a cave nearby, for the disappearance of several young animals in the area.

Initially it was thought eagles were to blame.

The killing of the snake was only discovered by chance after villagers had laid it on the side of the bridge and were planning to remove the skin.

A tourist spotted the dead reptile and decided to take a picture.
