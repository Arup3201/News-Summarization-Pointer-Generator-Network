A 28-bedroom country manor has been put on the market for only £500,000 - because it is simply too big.

Stunning Moreton House is a Grade II-listed ‘gentleman’s residence’ near Bideford, Devon, which is spread over a staggering 34,250 sq ft.

This makes it around 35 times the size of the average UK home and more than half the size of a football pitch.

Moreton House, which appears to be in good condition, has been given its attractive price because it is ‘so big’.

James
 Gibbs, land and new home director at Jackson-Stops & Staff, said: 
‘It is great value for money if you want something different.

‘It
 is priced like this because it is so large. If it was a tenth of the 
size it would probably still be the same price so you’re basically 
getting 90 per cent free.

‘It could be a school, a hotel, converted into apartments or be used as a single home for someone with a lot of furniture.’

Work on the mansion is thought to have been started in 1760 and it was completed in 1821. 

George Buck, who was the High Sheriff of Devon, lived in the home. Over the years it has undergone significant changes.

Stunning: Moreton House is a Grade II-listed 'gentleman's residence' near Bideford, Devon, which is spread over a staggering 34,250 sq ft

Grounds: Set in five acres, it has a wealth of period features and elegantly grand rooms

Same price: This 'substantial and secure' garage (highlighted by the red box) tucked away on Canning Place Mews in Kensington, London, is also available for £500,000

In 1913, three of the first floor rooms overlooking the gardens were merged to create a ballroom with ornate ceilings and a parquet wood floor.

Other features include ornate ceilings and fireplaces, bay windows and a Jacobean style staircase with carved newels.

It has most recently been used as boarding school.  

Mr Gibbs added: ‘It is the largest house I have sold and we have had a lot of interest in it, including an enquiry from an old boy.’

For the same price as the mansion you could buy a garage in Central London, located near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s home.

The ‘substantial and secure’ garage is tucked away on Canning Place Mews, which is a 10-minute walk from Kensington Palace.
