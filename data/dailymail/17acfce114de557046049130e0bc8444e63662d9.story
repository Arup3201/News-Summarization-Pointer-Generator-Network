England manager Roy Hodgson has agreed not to pick Daniel Sturridge for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers — and so avoided a club v country row.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers said after Wednesday night’s defeat in Basle: ‘I’ve spoken to Roy today and he accepts that he (Sturridge) is not fit and he has to use the next two weeks to get fit for his club — which is the priority.’

Daniel Sturridge was injured in training for England earlier this month resulting in him missing the opening European Championship qualifier against Switzerland

Liverpool were bracing themselves for Sturridge to be selected on Thursday in the squad to face San Marino and Estonia, despite Rodgers warning that the 25-year-old will not be fit. 

England’s medical staff spent time at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground with the club’s doctors on Monday assessing Sturridge’s injury ahead of the announcement.

The 25-year-old striker, who is recovering from a thigh problem and missed Wednesday night’s defeat, has been a huge success since joining Liverpool 18 months ago and is on the verge of signing a new £150,000-a-week deal. 

He still has four years left on the terms agreed after his £12million arrival from Chelsea. But Liverpool are ready to reward his progress — he has scored 36 goals in 52 games — with a new deal, heavily incentivised on his performances and run to the summer of 2019.

As for Hodgson, he names his squad on Thursday to take on San Marino (next Thursday), Estonia (October 12) and Slovenia (November 15). 

Manchester United left back Luke Shaw is set to drop down into the Under 21s, with Kieran Gibbs in line for a recall to the seniors. Calum Chambers may be retained by Hodgson as cover for John Stones, Phil Jagielka and Gary Cahill.

On Wednesday, former England defender Rio Ferdinand, releasing his autobiography #2sides this week, claimed England have problems starting at junior level.

Daniel Sturridge is eyeing up a new deal at Anfield to keep him at the club until the summer of 2019

Ferdinand said on Facebook: ‘The problems in our game that need to be addressed go much deeper. We have to be thinking about Under 14s and 15s as the Germans and other top countries do. There are cycles in football and we need to create our own. 

'Look at the Dutch. Going into the tournament (World Cup), they were the least fancied of the bigger nations but ended up a shootout away from the final. They’ve been clever and clear about their football for decades. 

'We’re producing good players. But no one knows how they can be fitted into the team. The FA changes are nowhere near radical enough.’
