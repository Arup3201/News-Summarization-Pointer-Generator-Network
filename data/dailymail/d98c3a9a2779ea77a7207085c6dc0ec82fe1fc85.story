This once-crystal clear lake has turned bright green because of a toxic algae, killing fish and forcing residents to wear masks to disguise the unbearable stench.

Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, has had a devastating effect on Ypacarai Lake near Aregua, Paraguay since it was found some five months ago.

The algae has reportedly been caused by water contamination from garbage and wastewater dumped in the 
lake without treatment.

Local authorities are desperately seeking ways to reverse the deterioration of the lake which spans 35 square miles and is almost 10ft deep.

In an official statement the public works and communications minister Enrique Buzarquis wants to declare the popular tourist destination to be in a state of environmental emergency, a move which is hoped to encourage a clean-up program of the area.

The long term effects of the pollution can only be estimated

He stressed that without the construction of a sewer network in the area, any clean-up would be useless.

Blue-green algae flourishes during hot weather and while not all blooms are poisonous, around half will produce toxins which can kill livestock and domestic animals.

Humans who ingest the algae may suffer stomach upsets or rashes.
