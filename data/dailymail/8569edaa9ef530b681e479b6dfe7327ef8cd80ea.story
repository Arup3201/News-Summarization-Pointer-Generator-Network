If you are looking to add some 'dazzle' to your Halloween costume this year, and have a cool million to share, then look no further.

The world's most expensive morphsuit has been unveiled, and it will cost the wearer an astonishing £1 million.

The 'Million Pound Morph' creation promises to fit like a glove, as well as being breathable and easy to see through, and of course impressing your friends as you drip with over 20,000 diamonds.

The suit would certainly set the wearer apart on Halloween, and promises to 'fit like a glove'

Costume company, Morphsuits, has come up with the latest design, which uses a grey spandex costume as the base, before painstakingly attaching the precious stones.

The retailer has priced the suit at £1million as a reflection of the quality of the diamonds used and the time it's taken to create such a masterpiece.

It goes on sale just ahead of Halloween, when revellers around the world look for the most striking costume to be seen out in during scary celebrations.

Gregor Lawson, cofounder of Morphsuits, said: 'All our suits are very reasonably priced, but with this one we just wanted to have fun, do something crazy, eye-catching and really good looking.

'This costume is the Mercedes Benz of Morphsuits. Someone is going to stand out from the crowd bigtime this Halloween if it sells...!'

Owner of Morphsuits claims the diamond suit was created because people were asking for a 'flashier' suit this Halloween

Morphsuits, despite their appearance to the contrary, are very comfortable and easy to wear, even suitable for a 10K run

Morphsuits are all-in-one spandex suit that cover the whole body from head to toe.

The simple suit, which appears highly impractical to the human eye, is in fact easy to wear, and even allows users to complete simple tasks while inside, despite others being able to identify them.

Mr Lawson added: 'Like our other suits you can breathe through, drink through and see through them, but this one has something extra special.

'We like to cater for all our customers' tastes. We had people asking for a 'flashier' suit this Halloween, so we decided, why the hell not! Halloween just got a little bit flashier!'

The new addition will be available to buy along Morphsuits' regular Halloween outfits, which are being used in 'Fright Mob' activity to prank unsuspecting members of the public during the month of October.
