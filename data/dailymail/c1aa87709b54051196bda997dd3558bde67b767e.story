A woman whose husband filmed a viral video to beg her to come home after she cheated on him two years ago has revealed they have since had another child and renewed their vows.

John Cook from Casino in northern NSW posted a video online in 2012 holding up handwritten cards urging his wife Rebecca to 'please come home'.

The video was viewed more than 700,000 times and convinced Mr Cook's 'soul mate for eternity' to give their marriage a second chance after the affair.

John and Rebecca Cook from Casino in northern NSW reunited after an online video begged Rebecca to 'please come home' after she had an affair two years ago

The couple married in 2002 after he proposed over a McDonald's meal and they now have four children together

Two years on, the couple are now busy rebuilding their marriage and raising their four young children after Mrs Cook fell pregnant following the ordeal in November 2012, ninemsn reported.

'The kids are young, aged between 10 months and eight, so they don't understand what's happened,' Mrs Cook told MailOnline.

'I reckon when they're older they would be influenced by how far we've come and how we stuck it out. (The video) will teach them how we still love each other despite the trauma.'

But not everyone has been as accepting of the couple's decision to reunite their marriage.

'I've had a couple of friends that disagreed with my actions and they've tried to make my life hell. My family calls me and also carries on about it,' Mrs Cook said.

'It just proves that they didn't really care about what was going on.'

When the couple reunited they went to marriage counselling and then renewed their vows

Mr Cook's video was viewed more than 700,000 times on YouTube but has since been taken down

Mrs Cook said the video was a positive turning point in their lives but it was challenging to get where they are now.

'It was a very difficult journey. We went to marriage counselling and then renewed our vows. It was something we knew we had to do,' she said.

'When it happened I thought I'd stuffed up my entire family and life. So (the vows) were renewing our trust with each other.'

While Mrs Cook credits the viral video as the reason they are still together, the couple rarely look back on what happened.

'We just don't talk about it. We've come to terms with what's happened and now we've moved on,' she said.

The video, which has since been taken off YouTube, showed photos of the couple with Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On as the backing music.

When she was watching the video Mrs Cook remembers thinking 'What have I done?'

'When I first watched it, it was really hard. I felt betrayed because the other guy was there at the time,' she said.

'Then I watched it on my own, I could see he was proving to me that he loved me and I was thinking "what have I done"?'

Mrs Cook joked her husband was now working hard to be romantic and 'keep their marriage alive' considering he proposed over a McDonald's meal in 2002.
