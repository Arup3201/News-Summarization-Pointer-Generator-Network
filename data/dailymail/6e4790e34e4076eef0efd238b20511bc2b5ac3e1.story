A Philadelphia civil forfeiture law has reportedly allowed the government to take away citizens' homes - and much of it funds city prosecutors.

CBS Philadelphia reported on the story, saying homeowners Christos Sourovelis, Norys Hernandez and Doris Welch have filed a lawsuit, which 'claims property owners do not get to go before a judge before their property is seized, which violates the due process clause of the constitution.'

The home Sourovelis shares with his wife, Markela Sourovelis, was snatched 'because their son was caught selling $40 worth of drugs outside the house,' according to the affiliate station.

'I didn’t do nothing wrong…I didn’t bother anybody, but still they came in and moved us out of our house,' Christos Sourovelis told CBS Philadelphia. 'I have rights and we are still fighting for our house - no owners of houses in Philadelphia deserve that.'

Markela Sourovelis alleged to the affiliate station 'We keep getting sent to this 478 room and for months, we go there and fill out papers.'

Their attorney Darpana Sheth told CBS Philadelphia 'Courtroom 478 is no courtroom at all. There’s no judge, there’s no jury, there’s not even a court reporter to transcribe these so-called hearings– instead it’s the prosecutors that run Courtroom 478.'

'[The money from civil forfeiture] goes to pay salaries, including to prosecutors who wield an enormous amount of discretion to bring forfeiture claims,' Sheth also said.

The city gets $6 million from civil forfeiture each year, she told CBS Philadelphia.

The Phildelphia Inquirer reported that the civil forfeiture law was meant to punish drug dealers, and that  'Philadelphia has brought in more than $64 million in seized property during the last decade.'

'Proceeds make up almost 20 percent of the annual budget of the District Attorney's Office. Forty percent pays for prosecutor salaries, including those of the lawyers involved in forfeiture proceedings,' the newspaper pointed out.

The Sourovelis are inside the home again, but legally cannot keep their son there, The Inquirer reported.

District Attorney Seth Williams' spokesperson, Tasha Jamerson, told the newspaper 'in all efforts, we follow applicable law to protect the rights of all of those involved - not only drug dealers... but the law-abiding citizens who are negatively affected by them.'
