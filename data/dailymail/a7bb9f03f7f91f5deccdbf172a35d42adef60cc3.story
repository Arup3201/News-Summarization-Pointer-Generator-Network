Kifueni Kadiabioko was caught eight years after he raped a child

A child rapist was finally caught when his victim’s eagle-eyed aunt spotted him on a train nearly eight years after he attacked her niece.

Kifueni Kadiabioko, 41, was recognised by the woman as he chatted to friends on a train at London’s Euston station on February 12 this year.

Kadiabioko had been wanted in connection with an attack on a 12-year-old girl in Coventry in October 2004 and the aunt, who had previously met the assailant at a church group, alerted the police.

Officers then arrested Kadiabioko after the train pulled into Northampton station.

He was transferred to West Midlands Police station where the investigation was still live and presented with DNA evidence which had been safely stored since being recovered from the victim’s clothing.

Kadiabioko then admitted raping the 12-year-old on three occasions, all after accosting her on the way home from school, and at Coventry Crown Court today he was jailed for 11 years and three months for each offence, to run concurrently.

He will also remain on the Sex Offenders Register indefinitely.

Kadiabioko was 33 when he 
befriended the victim’s family through a church group. He abused their trust 
and took advantage of the 12-year-old girl.

The attack took place after he pulled his car alongside her and beckoned her into the passenger seat on October 1 2004.

When she refused he dragged her inside by the arm and drove her to a one-bedroom flat where the assault took place.

Detective Constable Deb McCord from 
Coventry Police said: 'He was only known to church members by a nickname
and disappeared in October 2004 - we believe to Essex and London - 
fearing the girl had confided in her family.

'Initially he denied any sexual activity took place but forensics evidence was kept on file from the time of the offence and compared against Kadiabioko’s DNA which returned a match.

'It was a fantastic spot by the victim’s auntie. Her swift actions in notifying us meant we were able to liaise with British Transport Police and Northants Police to arrest him as the train pulled into Northampton.

'She should also be praised for her restraint in not challenging Kadiabioko and making her 999 call discretely so as not to alert him.

'This young girl was vulnerable and terrified by the actions of Kadiabioko; she showed extreme bravery in reporting it to police and remaining supportive of our investigation throughout.

'Her resilience has been admirable and this outcome could not have been achieved without that support.

'No-one should suffer sexual abuse in silence: we have specially trained officers on hand to sensitively guide victims through the reporting and interview procedure, and we are able to put them in touch with support groups who can help.'
