Saddlebags and dimply thighs beware. It is no longer just celebrities who can get the most cutting edge advice on how to shape up and fight the flab.

Louise Parker, a personal trainer to the stars, is sharing some of her fat fighting secrets in a new blog which 
she promises will help people shape up in just two weeks.

The 38-year-old mother of two from Sussex said this bank holiday Monday is the perfect time to start her 'figure magic 14' plan.

In shape: Mother-of-two Louise Parker says anyone can get a toned body like hers by following her diet and exercise tips

She said: 'My 14-day fat loss plan is based on the 
highly successful Intensive programme, which has been a celebrity 
favourite for over a decade now.'

Notice the difference: Louise said results will be seen after two weeks

Louise would not reveal who is on her books in order to protect their privacy but said she counts 'rock stars to royalty' among her current clients.

The plan she will share on her blog is a condensed version of what she offers her paying clients and can be followed by anyone thanks to the easy-to-make recipes involved and exercises that can be done at home or during a walk.

She said: 'The idea is super simple – delicious meal plans, easy to follow workouts and intelligent lifestyle tips. The three combined gives a really effective kick start for anyone stuck in a rut or needing some motivation to drop a few pounds.'

Starting from today for the next two weeks, Louise will post a daily meal plan, workout and lifestyle tip.

She explains: 'The purpose of the plan is to encourage you to set aside just a fortnight to really focus on your health and wellbeing and it's vitally important you stick to it day in, day out for two weeks.

'Consistency in my plans is more important than severity as it's this that yields the best results. This isn't about extreme diet days, which only sabotage your metabolism.'

She adds that the aim of the 14 day plan is to 'energise you, cleanse you, 
nourish you and rid your body of as much body fat as one can sensibly do
on any diet and fitness plan. If you stick to the programme for 
14 days, you will achieve results that you and others will notice.'

Beyond the two weeks, Louise said the benefits can be sustained by continuing to follow her methods on week days and then allowing yourself some indulgences on weekends.

Louise's lifestyle tip of the day: 'Hopefully you are refreshed after a good night's sleep. First step on day one: weigh in. Immediately after you wake up and spend a penny, jump on the scales.

This is your base weight. Write it down, tweet it, do as you wish, then on with the rest of the day.'

MEAL PLANNER

Breakfast: Eggs on toast. Two large eggs (organic if you can), poached and served on one slice of good quality wholemeal bread, served with two grilled tomatoes

Morning snack: One Braeburn apple and 12 almonds

Lunch: Chopped chicken salad. Finely chop a handful of mint, handful of flat leaf parsley, handful of coriander, three medium tomatoes, handful of cooked broccoli, two inch of cucumber, one to two spring onions and a baked chicken breast. Season with ½ tbsp of olive oil, ½ juice of fresh lemon, salt and pepper

Afternoon snack: One mini pot of reduced fat hummus with handful of sugar snap peas 

Supper: Chilli prawn stir fry. Pan fry in ½ tablespoon of groundnut oil, garlic and ginger the following: 100g of prawns, red and yellow pepper, broccoli, mange tout and bok choy (optional). Add 1 tablespoon of reduced salt soya sauce. Serve with extra green vegetables, sprinkled with ½ tsp of sesame seeds.

Drinks: Morning: Juice of ½ lemon mixed with ½ pint of boiling water, ½ pint of cold. Drink before any other teas or coffees. You may have a total of two coffees or teas per day, made with no more than 100ml of semi skimmed milk. No fruit juices or cordials and you must drink no less than 2 litres of water per day. If you are not a fan of water, add some chopped cucumber for a refreshing drink.

Mid morning and mid afternoon: Add one tsp of cranberry powder to ½ litre of water and drink. This can be part of your two litres of water per day. Listen to your thirst and drink as much water as your body tells you. 

EXERCISE: 40 minutes Figure Magic Fat Burning

The fat burning section lasts 40 minutes. Including the warm up and stretches it will take a total of 50 minutes. Either walk, brisk walk, jog, run or sprint to reach the intensity levels below for the given times. If you can, complete this session before breakfast as your body will dip into fat supplies more readily. If this doesn’t suit you, eat an apple or an orange before you exercise.
