Alec Baldwin's stalker admits that despite her recent brush with fame, going after the actor wasn't the wisest career move.

Genevieve Sabourin spoke from her temporary home on Riker's Island on Saturday to say that the high-profile fight has cost her more than just seven months of freedom.

'My reputation has been ruined,' the 41-year-old actress said. 'I can't even hide in Japan.'

'I am in prison for life': Not known for her subtly, convicted Alec Baldwin stalker Genevieve Sabourin says her once lucrative acting career is over because of her battle with the 30 Rock actor. She is currently serving 7 months at Riker's Island

Sabourin has no choice but to hide for the next several months. She's just two weeks into her sentence.

'I am in prison for life,' said the dramatic French Canadian, who recently that she was forced to sleep on excrement-smeared
floors during the first days of her sentence.

Sabourin sat down briefly with the New York Daily News and bemoaned her career ending battle with Baldwin.

'I can’t even get a job as a waitress. I used to wear designer clothes, take trips around the world and make $100,000,' she said. 'No one will hire me.'

Not the only one: Baldwin is pictured here leaving criminal court in Sabourin's trial. MSNB suspended the actor's new talk show, a move that followed an encounter Baldwin had with a photographer in which he used a homophobic slur

But Sabourin isn't taking the whole blame for what's become of her, she also blames the media:

'Where have you been for the last two years?' she asked the Daily News Reporter. 'Where were you journalists two years ago? Nobody asked to interview me then.'

She's also alleged that she had suffered a 'heart attack' at 
Rikers Island in New York and was billed for medication because as a 
non-U.S. citizen, she doesn't qualify for Medicare.

Sabourin was found guilty of aggravated harassment, stalking
and attempted criminal contempt among 23 other counts. She was 
sentenced to 210 days in total behind bars.

In a short interview from jail on Thursday, wearing her green prison jumpsuit, the bit-part actress told the New York Post: 'I have slept on the floor for three days.
It was covered in excrement. I had a heart attack.'

Since
being taken off from court in handcuffs last week, Sabourin has been 
held at Central Booking, the Tombs and now Rikers. She did not make 
clear where the 'excrement' was on the floor.

The City of New York Department of Correction was not immediately available for comment when called by MailOnline. 

Sabourin, who is due to appear in court on Friday, is scheduled to be released from prison March 30, 2014.

She is serving seven months for stalking and harassing Baldwin and his wife Hilaria.

She
was given an additional month for contempt of court after shouting out 
'You're lying' while Baldwin took the stand during her trial to testify 
that he had not slept with her.
