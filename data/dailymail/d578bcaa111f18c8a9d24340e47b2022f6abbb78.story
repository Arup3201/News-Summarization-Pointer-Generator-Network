Quarterback Tom Brady has the top selling jersey among female NFL fans in four states, but for the ladies of Vermont seem to prefer New Orleans' own Drew Bees.

But why should Brees beat out Brady in a state closer to the New England Patriots' home turf?

It's possible the Brees beats out Brady in Vermont simply because the Saint has a national following.  

Dick's Sporting Goods has created a map to show the top selling NFL jersey among female fans in every state

The data, compiled in a map by Dick's Sporting Goods, shows the top selling jersey among women fans in every state.

Other top sellers include Brandon Marshall in Illinois, Jason Witten in Texas, and Colin Kaepernick in California. 

As BDC Wire notes, Both Brees and Brady have similar sales patterns having the top spot in three states that would not normally be consider fan strongholds for their teams.

Quarterbacks Tom Brady and Drew Brees each dominate jersey sales among female fans in four states, even in those where their teams are not widely followed

Brady, for example, is a top seller in Wyoming.

They also top states that have small populations. There are only 627,000 in Vermont and just 583,000 in Wyoming.

For states with smaller populaces, even a handful of jersey sales can tip the scales.
