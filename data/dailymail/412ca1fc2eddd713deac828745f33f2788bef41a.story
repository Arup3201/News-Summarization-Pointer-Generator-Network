The home of the late Michael Winner is going on sale for £17.5million, a staggering sum for most people – but less than a third of what the late film director and critic believed it was worth.

Michael Winner, who bought the 47-room mansion in West London's Holland Park from his parents, was convinced the house was worth £60million and even put it on the market for this price in 2011.

Following the larger-than-life legend’s death in January, Woodland House, the home he shared with wife Geraldine – and several girlfriends before her, is being sold.

Price is right: The opulent home of the late Michael Winner and his wife Geraldine will go on sale this week for less than a third of the prize he had predicted

Wrong number: Michael Winner had previously put the house on the market for £60million, but nine months after his death it is going on sale for £17.5million

Extravagance: The house was initially three flats, but Michael Winner converted it into a mansion

Following his death, it emerged that 
on top of substantial debts, Mr Winner had taken out several mortgages 
against Woodland House to secure flats for his former girlfriends.

Winner
spent millions renovating Woodland House after buying it as a set of 
flats in 1978 and reinstating the building to its former grandeur.

These
pictures reveal the palatial size and extravagant luxury with which the
residence was decorated - a real reflection of the larger-than-life 
personality of Winner.

The 
house sits on the bend of a leafy crescent in Kensington and was built 
in the Queen Anne style by Richard Norman Shaw for a Victorian artist 
called Sir Luke Fildes.

The
house was originally three flats, which were bought by Winner's 
property magnate father, George, and it remains leasehold. The 
freeholder is Charlotte Townsend, one of Britain's richest women.

Like its master: The extravagant luxury of the mansion is a real reflection of the larger-than-life personality of Winner, who passed away in January this year

No-holds-barred: Michael Winner took over the flats from his father in 1978 and spent millions on the conversion, building a swimming pool, cinema and extensive gardens

Staying British: According to his wife Geraldine it was the wish of Winner, who died in January this year, that the flat be sold to a British family who would not cut it up into flats

Little palace: Winner would hold extravagant parties at Woodland House, a large part of which he had decorated himself

Winner
took possession of the house in 1978 when it was still flats and spent 
millions creating an opulent home, complete with swimming pool, cinema 
and extensive gardens, which he loved.

Despite
making the Victorian marvel a regular feature in celebrity and 
architectural magazines down the years, Winner was looking to sell the 
house in his later years.

Attempting a sale in 2011, Winner set the price at £60million, despite protests from the estate agent.

It
was originally his wish that it be taken over by the local council and 
become a museum, but the council declined, saying they could not afford 
to run it.

Although it is 
possible the sale will follow the recent West London trend of being 
snapped up by foreign buyers, this is not the desire of the late 
Winner’s wife.

‘I don;’t 
want developers coming and ripping everything apart and selling to some 
foreigners,’ Geraldine Winner told the Sunday Times.

She expressed a wish that Woodland House be sold to a British family to be kept in its current state as one house.

‘I think that’s what Michael would have wanted as well,’ she added.
