Boris John today mocked Nigel Farage's claim that he was late for an event because of immigrants on the road, branding the Ukip leader's views 'sewage'.

The London Mayor accused Mr Farage of 'freaking out' after complaining that the UK's 'open door immigration' policy meant that the M4 'is not as navigable as it used to be'.

Mr Johnson said such examples of xenophobia is like 'effluent... something that human beings naturally produce' but must be disposed of.

London Mayor Boris Johnson accused Mr Farage of 'freaking out' after complaining that the UK's 'open door immigration' policy meant that the M4 'is not as navigable as it used to be'

Mr Farage has been mocked for his elaborate excuse for missing an event charging Ukip supporters £25 each to meet him on Friday night.

He blamed immigration for there being too many cars on the roads to make the 180-mile journey from London to Port Talbot in south Wales.

He told BBC Sunday Politics Wales: 'It took me six hours and 15 minutes in the car to get here. It should have taken three-and-half to four.

'That has nothing to do with professionalism. What is does have to do with is a country in which the population is going through the roof, chiefly because of open door immigration and the fact the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be.

'In all these years in Ukip that's probably about the third event out of a thousand that I haven't made in time.'

Labour last night branded the comments 'silly' and 'dangerous'.

Today Mr Johnson said: 'Of all the excuses I’ve heard for being late, that is one of the poorest.'

He told LBC radio: “Xenophobia is like sewage, it’s a natural concomitant of the human condition. We’ve got to manage it, we’ve got to dispose of it. 

'It’s like effluent, it’s something that human beings naturally produce. It doesn’t mean human beings are bad.

“It’s part of the way human beings are. I think there’s a natural sort of tendency to be alarmed about the Other, the alien.'

He stressed that London has benefited 'massively' from immigration but he insisted:

'They need to speak English, they need to be loyal to this culture, to this country, to our institutions, to our society, to the Queen, to the rule of law – all the things that make us British – a sense of humour, and not freaking out about traffic jams on the motorway.'

Ukip held its first ever Welsh National Conference at the weekend, with Mr Farage delivering a speech to activists on Saturday.

But he had been due to mingle with paying guests at a reception on Friday night.

Around 100 Ukip members paid £25 each for tickets for the event at the Orangery in Margam Country Park, Port Talbot.

Mr Farage complained that the M4, linking London to south Wales, was the 'not as navigable as it used to be'

But the leader failed to turn up, later pointing the finger at the number of immigrants using the roads.

Owen Smith, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, said: 'Remarks like these are what makes Farage so dangerous.

'It is clearly absurd to suggest heavy traffic on the M4 is caused by immigration, but through the laughter at his silly comments you can hear Ukip's dog-whistle politics of division.'

Last week it emerged that Ukip pays £60,000-a-year for Mr Farage to enjoy the services of a chauffeur. 

Mr Farage told LBC on Friday: 'You look at all the other leaders of political parties, they of course, all have the state provide them with, you know, the means to get around, and with security. The state doesn't provide Ukip with anything.'

He said he had written to the government asking for state help with his security bills, but it had been refused.

He suggesed he should be given the same level of protection as 'any former Northern Ireland Secretary'.

'I'm not having an argument over it, the fact is we don't get help. Do I need (a) security? Yes. And do I need to be driven around from place to place? I think I probably do.

'I mean, I came up here early this morning, I'm off to Swansea in a minute to give a speech. I think I do actually need...so there is a team, there are two guys who are with me and take me round the place. 

'And if that's being interpreted by one national newspaper as somehow I'm now living high on the hog, in this luxury 4 x 4 car, all I would say to the newspaper that writes stuff like that is, come and spend a week with me, you'll be half dead by the end of it.'
