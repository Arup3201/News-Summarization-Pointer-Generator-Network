Newcastle United have admitted that if they were look to elsewhere for a head coach, they would consider British or foreign candidates - but he'd need to be 'tactically astute.'

During a fans forum meeting Managing Director Lee Charnley and Ambassador Bob Moncur were among the representatives, as the supporters grilled them on issues at the club.

With John Carver failing to win over the fans with some dour displays from his side, Newcastle's hierarchy admitted that they could look to someone else for inspiration.

They said during the fans forum: 'In the event the board should need to look for an external candidate in the summer for the position of Head Coach, the board would not have to start the process all over again due to the level of detail and work which went into the initial search. 

'The board would look for an individual who would fit into the club's structure, someone who is tactically astute, and who has a track record of developing young players and the ability to improve players. 

'The club has no concerns over whether a potential new head coach is British or from overseas and deems other criteria far more important.'

With fans keen to know the prospect of who the club's next manager will be, Charnley was quick to reiterate that Carver was the best man for job until at least the summer. 

'The board stated that it will not consider the matter again until the end of the season,' they added.

'The board went through a lengthy process in terms of speaking to a number of people about coming to the club as a potential head coach. 

'The outcome of that process was that the board felt the best option was for John Carver to be appointed to the position until the end of the season, at which point it will be reviewed.'

Derby manager Steve McLaren is reportedly their first choice for the job but it remains to be seen whether he'd be leave his current club with promotion to the Premier League very much a possibility. 

Remi Garde was installed as the early favourite - with the club allegedly meeting the former Lyon boss in January - and he still remains as a popular choice by the fans. 

Frank de Boer recently signed a new deal with Ajax to rule himself out, while Christophe Galtier is well thought of by the St James' Park hierarchy, it's unknown whether he'd jump ship.
