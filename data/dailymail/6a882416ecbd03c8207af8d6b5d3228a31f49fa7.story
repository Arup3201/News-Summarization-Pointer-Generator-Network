Manchester City made Eliaquim Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football after paying £31.9million to sign the French centre back from FC Porto.

Mangala’s protracted move to the Premier League champions finally went through on Monday with his transfer fee eclipsing the £30m deal that took Rio Ferdinand from Leeds to Manchester United in 2002.

Mangala, 23, became City’s sixth signing of the summer after agreeing a five-year deal, and manager Manuel Pellegrini is confident that one of the most highly rated defenders in Europe will prove to be well worth the money.

City tried to sign Mangala and Porto pal Fernando in January but it’s taken until the summer to seal deals.

Why the delay? Everything seemed ready to go last month, but negotiations stalled because a private company owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. Porto only received £23m of the £31.9m fee with the rest said to have been paid to Doyen Sports Investments.

But isn’t he French? He was born in Paris but moved to Belgium at five, where he started as a striker. Standard Liege converted him to a defender and sold him to Porto for £6m. He is one of four Frenchmen at City, along with Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy. Despite his fee he couldn’t get a game for France at the World Cup and was their fourth-choice centre back.

Didn’t United want him? And Chelsea. Asked about his preference in May, he said: ‘City or Chelsea? Chelsea because it’s London.’

Didn’t UEFA cap City’s net spend this summer at £49m? Yes, and they’ve spent £49.9m on Mangala, Fernando, Willy Caballero and Bruno Zuculini. Sagna was free and Frank Lampard is on loan. They got £10m from Sunderland for Jack Rodwell and £12m will follow when Javi Garcia joins Zenit St Petersburg.

Mangala has the tools — power, pace and composure — to be the ideal partner for Vincent Kompany.

‘I’m delighted to have added a player of Eliaquim’s quality in the squad,’ said Pellegrini, who saw his defence struggle in the 3-0 defeat by Arsenal in Sunday’s Community Shield.

‘He is already a fine player but in my opinion he has all the mental, physical, technical and tactical attributes to become one of Europe’s very best defenders.

‘Eliaquim is a player I believe will make an immediate impact in the Premier League, thanks to his physicality, his reading of the game and quality on the ball — I think he will prove to be a great signing for us.’ 

Having first made a move for Mangala in the January transfer window, City agreed terms with Porto and the player himself this summer but negotiations were held up because a private company, Doyen Sports Investments, owned 33 per cent of his economic rights.

Third-party ownership of a player is prohibited under Premier League rules. Porto are only being paid £23m of the total fee with Belgian club Standard Liege receiving a small sell-on bonus under the terms of Mangala’s £6m move to Portugal three years ago.

Mangala, who had also been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea, becomes the second Porto player to join City this summer following Fernando’s £12m move to the Etihad.

Pellegrini has also signed goalkeeper Willy Caballero, defender Bacary Sagna and midfielder Bruno Zuculini, while former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard has arrived on a six-month loan from New York City.

Mangala also becomes the fourth Frenchman on City’s books, joining Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy at the club. He was a member of France’s World Cup squad this summer, but did not play for Didier Deschamps’s side in Brazil.

He is determined to add to his medal collection at City after winning league titles in Belgium and Portugal with Liege and Porto, but he admitted that it has been difficult training on his own while his future was resolved.

‘I am the kind of player that comes on the pitch to win,’ he said.

‘I am not giving away anything, I always fight until the end and I hope that we will win quite a lot of titles this season.

‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure. I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays, but after a time I started to find the time quite long.

‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible.

‘City is a top club in Europe. For me, it was an important step to leave Porto and join Manchester City in order to continue my progress. I want to win titles and I believe I can do this.

‘I am ambitious and this is why I’m here. I’m very happy to come to England because for me, the Premier League is the best league in the world. It is a very intense and very aggressive competition.

‘The fact that Fernando is here is better because I played with him at Porto but there are also other players that I know like Sagna, Clichy and Nasri.’

Despite the record deal, City are still within their net transfer limit of £49m set by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations.

Mangala is expected to form a centre-back partnership with captain Vincent Kompany. With Pellegrini also having Martin Demichelis, Dedryck Boyata and Karim Rekik in his squad, Mangala’s arrival will push Matija Nastasic and Micah Richards closer to the exit following Joleon Lescott’s departure at the end of last season.

Meanwhile goalkeeper Caballero has promised he will fight to keep Joe Hart out of the City starting line-up after being picked ahead of the England keeper for the Community Shield.

It was not a debut to remember for Caballero, but the 32-year-old Argentine wants another chance when City launch their title defence at Newcastle, on Sunday.

He said: ‘I want to be No 1. I will train for this weekend for the next decision to see who starts next week. Both of us will train for that chance. But I came to fight for the No 1 spot. My ambition is to fight for the position and to be there when the manager needs me.

‘This was an important match for me. I had a chance to play and am happy for this, but not happy with the score.’

Caballero was a £6m summer signing from Malaga where he worked with Pellegrini and his arrival has an ominous ring for Hart, who lost his place for two months last season when the City boss turned to Costel Pantilimon, who has since joined Sunderland. Caballero has clearly not moved to Manchester with the intention of sitting on the bench.

‘We have a strong team,’ he added. ‘We are the Premier League champions, with very good players, but we have things we need to prove.’
