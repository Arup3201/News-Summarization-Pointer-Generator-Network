A four-year-old boy was in hospital last night after being shot in the face with an air gun pellet on his way home from his village school.

Zak Horton was running along an alleyway with twin brother Charlie when he was hit on the chin by the potentially lethal pellet leaving blood pouring from his face.

A 17-year-old has been arrested and bailed over the incident.

Shocking: Zak recovering in hospital after the incident which happened less than 100m from his school

Zak had been on his way home from 
Studley’s Community Infants School in Warwickshire on Tuesday when he 
was shot in front of his horrified mother, Hayley.

The youngster was rushed to Redditch’s Alexandra Hospital where medics operated to remove the pellet.

Zak has since been sedated with parents Hayley, 28, and Jack, 27, maintaining a bedside vigil.

Zak's
father Jack, a Land Rover engineer in Solihull’s Lode Lane factory, 
said: 'I was just coming out of work when Hayley phoned me.

'She said she was just behind the boys as they were running together and she heard a gunshot.

'Immediately after that Zak turned around screaming. The blood was pouring from his face and my wife phoned for an ambulance.

'I was in shock, it was something I would never expect to happen. It’s a quiet village.'

The shooting happened at around 3.25pm in an alleyway less than 100 metres from Zak’s school.

The youngster, of nearby Watts Road, was expected to be discharged from hospital today.

It's not the first time youngsters 
have been hit by the weapons. In 2008 a shocking picture emerged of 
an air gun pellet lodged inside a four-year-old's brain after she was 
accidentally shot by her six-year-old sister in Stoke-on-Trent.

In
2010 a two-year-old boy from Lincolnshire was treated in intensive care
after he was accidentally shot in the neck with an air rifle by his 
father who fired it without knowing it was loaded.

There are an estimated four million air rifles in the UK and they're mainly used for formal and recreational target shooting.

Carrying
a loaded air gun in a public place has a sentence of up to six months 
in prison or a fine of up to £5,000, while people convicted of firing an
air weapon within 50ft of a road can be fined £1,000.

The
law states that no one under the age of 18 can be in possession of an 
airgun unless they are supervised by someone over 21, although there are
some exceptions.

Mr Horton said: 'I was furious that 
somebody could be so stupid and irresponsible or evil to want to inflict
this pain on a child.

'The pellet hit him in the chin and 
luckily the jawbone stopped the pellet - if it had hit him in the mouth 
or eye or his temple it could have been fatal.'

Recovering: Doctors managed to remove the pellet from Zak's chin at the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch

He
added: 'People need to know how dangerous air rifles are. This is no 
laughing matter, we need to look at tightening up the licensing laws on 
these guns.'

A Warwickshire Police spokesman said:
'A four-year old boy was treated in hospital following an incident in 
which he was injured in the face by a pellet believed to have been fired
from a pellet gun.

'The boy was taken to hospital in Worcester where he underwent surgery to remove the pellet from his chin.'

She
added: 'A 17-year-old male was arrested and questioned in connection 
with the incident and has been bailed pending further police inquiries.'
