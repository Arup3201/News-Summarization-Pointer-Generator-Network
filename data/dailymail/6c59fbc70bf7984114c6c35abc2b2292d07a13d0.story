With the Christmas party season just a few days away, the pressure is on to uncover the perfect festive outfit.

But while glamorous sequins and 70's chic fur might be topping the trend list, the majority of shoppers will be plumping for a good old-fashioned Little Black Dress.

According to analysts, Saturday is set to be the biggest day of the year for LBD sales, with 29 per cent more than usual expected to fly off the rails.  

Queen of the LBD: A new survey reveals that sales of little black dresses, as loved by Victoria Beckham, are going to hit a high this weekend

Although not this Christmas' top trend, LBDs have long been a party season staple thanks to their unerring ability to flatter the wearer, whatever their shape.

A perennial favourite on the red carpet, A-listers to embrace the look include the Duchess of Cambridge, Angelina Jolie and Victoria Beckham.

The ever-stylish Jennifer Aniston has long been a fan, while Kim Kardashian is only ever one dress change away from a little black dress.

But while celebrities have the styling side covered, not everyone is so lucky. Now Debenhams has come to the rescue with an LBD guide which claims to help everyone find the perfect frock.

'Appointments for personal styling this week were totally booked up well in advance,' said a spokesman for Debenhams which conducted the research.

'The garment that the majority of clients have said they want help purchasing is that elusive little black dress.

'The perfect one will take you from a cocktail party to an opera, from a Michelin starred restaurant to a night club, without missing a beat.

'A dress that can do that is certainly worth the effort, but it is surprising how many women don’t know where to start when finding the perfect LBD to showcase their body type. 

'After seeing so many ladies who told us they didn’t have a clue what to look for in a LBD, we decided to come up with our own comprehensive guide.'
