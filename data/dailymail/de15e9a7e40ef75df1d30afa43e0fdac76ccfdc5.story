The body of an Australian soldier who went missing more than two weeks ago while on holiday in the U.S. has been found near the top of a mountain in upstate New York.

Captain Paul McKay, 31, was last seen walking down a train track on New Year’s Eve carrying a large backpack.

Despite a huge search involving tracker dogs, helicopters and a team of volunteers, police were unable to trace him.

His remains were finally found on Wednesday at 11am local time, around 150 metres from a trail on Scarface Mountain. The peak, which is 932 metres high, is a popular spot for hikers.

‘This is not the outcome we had hoped for,’ Saranac Lake police chief Bruce Nason told AAP on Thursday.

Capt McKay, from Canberra, was reported missing on January 3 after his family became seriously concerned about his wellbeing.

The soldier, who has been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), had sent an email to his father on December 30 leaving him all of his possessions. When police searched the Saranac Lake hotel where he had been staying, they found personal items including his camera and clothes.

Capt McKay developed PTSD after returning from a tour of Afghanistan in 2011. At the time of his death, he was on leave from the Australian Army.

His family were unaware that he was on holiday in the US. Just after he checked out is his hotel, the region was hit by very cold weather caused by a polar vortex, which led to snow storms and temperatures dropping below minus 30C.

A New York forest ranger found the soldier’s body while climbing the mountain on Wednesday. Capt McKay body was covered only by a blanket and was found in a section of mountain hidden from search helicopters.

The cause of death is unknown and an autopsy will be conducted on the body on Thursday but police say that there are no signs of foul play.

‘The family has been informed of this news and we express our deepest sympathy for their loss’, Chief Nason said.
