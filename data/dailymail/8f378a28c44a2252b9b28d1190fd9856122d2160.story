In A final humiliation, Vicky Pryce was yesterday stripped of her official honour, the Companion of the Order of the Bath.

Pryce was jailed earlier this year for taking speeding points for her ex-husband Chris Huhne and yesterday lost the honour, earned for her services as an economist.

The former senior civil servant, who split from the Lib Dem Cabinet minister after he had an affair with press officer Carina Trimingham. was sentenced to eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice, but served just two.

Going, going gong: Economist Vicky Pryce, who wore an electronic tag to give evidence to a House of Lords committee this month, has been stripped of her CB

An announcement published in the 
London Gazette read: ‘The Queen has directed that the appointment of 
Vicky, Mrs Pryce, to be a Member of the Civil Division of the Third 
Class, or Companion, of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, dated 
June 13, 2009, shall be cancelled and annulled and that her name shall 
be erased from the Register of the said Order.’

The decision came after Labour MP 
Andrew Gwynne wrote to David Cameron, saying that ‘convicted criminals 
should not be allowed to hold honours bestowed in good faith by HM the 
Queen’.

Disgraced: Former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne was also jailed along with ex-wife Pryce after they falsely told police she had been driving when his car was caught by a speed camera, so that he could avoid a driving ban

He demanded the Prime Minister call a
meeting of the honours forfeiture committee to consider the case for 
stripping the economist of her honour. 

He wrote: ‘I have no doubt that the 
vast majority of the public will find it profoundly unacceptable that a 
convicted criminal with such disregard for British justice continues to 
hold such an illustrious honour.’

After her release from prison, Pryce 
appeared before a parliamentary committee wearing an electronic tag to 
answer questions on the economic crisis in Europe.

She is currently writing a book entitled Prisonomics, about women and the criminal justice system.

Anyone who has been sentenced to 
three months prison or more can have their honour cancelled at the 
discretion of the forfeiture committee, which is led by the country’s 
top civil servant, Sir Bob Kerslake.

Fred Goodwin, the disgraced former 
Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive, was stripped of his knighthood 
after taxpayers were forced to bail out his bank. It had been given for 
services to the financial services industry, which was on the brink of 
collapse.

In 1979 art historian Anthony Blunt, 
who was personal adviser to the Queen on art, was stripped of his 
knighthood after being exposed as the Fourth Man in the Burgess, Maclean
and Philby spy scandal.

The boxer ‘Prince’ Naseem Hamed was 
stripped of his MBE in 2007 by the forfeiture committee after serving a 
sentence for dangerous driving.

But while members of the public can 
have their honours removed for bringing the system ‘into disrepute’, 
convicted criminals hold on to their life peerages.

Members of the House of Lords only lose their voting rights when they are in jail, suspended or during a period of bankruptcy.

The Order of Bath originated in 1100 
and is the fourth most senior award of chivalry. Recipients and their 
children are given the privilege of marrying in Westminster Abbey.
