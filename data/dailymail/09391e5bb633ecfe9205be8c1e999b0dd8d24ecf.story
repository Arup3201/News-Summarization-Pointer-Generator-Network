This is the moment a moped gang attacked a terrified businessman with a hammer outside his £2million home before making off with his rare £60,000 Ferrari watch.

The man, who is in his 50s, was sweeping outside his home in Hampstead, north London, when the gang of four pulled up outside the property on two mopeds.

Sensing they were dangerous, the unidentified man attempted to defend himself with his broom.

CCTV footage shows a gang of four attacking a businessman as he was sweeping outside his £2million home. Pictured is the moment one of the gang grabs the man's broom from him before beating him with it

However, one of the gang then grabbed the broom and hit him with it - pushing the man out towards the road.

A third member then launched at the businessman with a hammer while the first robber hits the man with his broom - driving him back towards his house.

Seconds later, a fourth drove onto the man's driveway in the shocking footage.

At one point, one of the men took the victim's rare £60,000 watch from his arm.

One of the men also took a gold chain from around his neck and his wedding ring.

Eventually, the businessman managed to get to his house following the brutal attack on April 11  - closing the security gate behind him.

The gang then mounted their mopeds and drove off. The whole incident lasted just over a minute.

The terrifying attack is the latest in a stream of similar incidents in the Hampstead area in the past few months.

However, this is the first time the gang have been caught on CCTV.

The traumatised man is now planning on fleeing the country as he is terrified the men will return.

He told the Evening Standard: 'It isn’t a question of ‘if’ they come back. They will come back. I have been driven out of my own house and the country.'

The victim told the newspaper he thinks he was attacked by the gang as he parks a sports car in the driveway of his £2 million home.

Eventually, the men make off on their mopeds - leaving the businessman scared and shaken. The attack follows several similar incidents in the area - including one on footballer Alexander Merkel

Watford player Alexander Merkel had to fight off a four-strong gang of robbers at his home earlier this month

The Metropolitan Police have been contacted by MailOnline - who have said they will release a statement following clarification from an officer.

This attack took place just three weeks before Watford transfer Alexander Merkel’s house was also raided by a moped gang - who attempted to break down his door.

Speaking after the attack, the footballer said: 'I heard a commotion outside and went to have a look. Two mopeds with four people on the back were outside a neighbour's front door.

'One of the guys tried to kick it in but bounced off in a rather comical fashion. They then tried to ram it with their scooters.'

The gang is believed to have struck in another street nearby an hour earlier.

Detective Constable Andy Palmer, from Camden Police, said at the time: 'I am sure this gang is known to certain members of the community so I would urge them to contact police before someone is seriously hurt.'

He said the two main suspects were aged between 18 and 25. One was 6ft tall, of slim build and with an Irish accent. The other was 6ft 2in and of medium build.
