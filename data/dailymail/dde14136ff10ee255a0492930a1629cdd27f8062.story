This is the shocking image of the damage inflicted on Port Vale captain Doug Loft's face following a training ground bust-up with team-mate Daniel Jones.

Vale have sacked defender Jones and Loft has now been ruled out for the rest of the season with a broken cheekbone.

The incident happened on Thursday last week and neither player featured in the 4-2 defeat by Notts County.

Injured: Skipper Doug Loft suffered a broken cheekbone during the incident

Issues: Port Vale manager Micky Adams says the club will hold an internal investigation

Vale boss Micky Adams and senior club management have been fully supportive of Loft and plan to hold an internal investigation.But the club have already decided to sack 27-year-old Jones who has a year remaining on his current dealt - captain Loft is contracted until the end of the season.

The incident comes as a huge blow to the club who had been targeting a place in the play-offs.

Loft has been enjoying some of the best form of his career and has scored nine goals this season after leading the club to automatic promotion last term.

Loft's solicitor Paul Dodds said: ‘Doug is genuinely shocked by what has happened to him. He is focusing on obtaining the best treatment so he can get back  playing as quickly as possible.

‘However, given the type of injury, it cannot be ruled out that legal proceedings will follow.’

Speaking about the incident, Loft told Sky Sports News: 'There's a chance (of legal proceedings) but I just want to get my face right and then I will go away and talk with my family and decide about my future.

'I have never had a problem with Jonesy and he has never had one with me, as far as I know.

'We went into a tackle and as I was getting up off the floor he hit me. I fell backwards and sat on the floor, the gaffer sent him in and I went to hospital for X-rays. He texted me on the day and said sorry, that was it.'

Loft will be out of contract in the summer and he is frustrated that the chance to possibly put himself in the shop window during the club's remaining four matches has been taken away.

He added: 'At the minute I am angry. I have been playing really well and I was getting a lot of interest and I knew that people were watching me. I am annoyed and upset that I will miss the rest of the season.'

The defeat to relegation-threatened County now means it is unlikely that Vale will make the play-offs as they are 10 points off with four games left to play.

'It's been a poor week for us,' Vale boss Adams told the BBC.

'For legal reasons, there's very little I can say other than on Thursday there was an incident between two players.

'The training ground incident resulted in one of the players, who I might add is an innocent party to this, receiving a facial injury that has consequently ruled him out for the rest of the season.

Ruled out: Loft will miss the remainder of the season after the incident which occurred last Thursday

Trouble: Jones is on the lookout for a new club after being sacked by the League One side

'It's another negative headline that, for some reason, this club attracts. But it has to be dealt with internally.

'Incidents like we had are disappointing, but they happen.

'The players who have represented the club over the past two years should feel proud. Even in the season when we went into administration, I was proud of everybody's efforts.'
