A 39-year-old man pimped a teenage runaway out on Craigslist for more than two years in exchange for meth and cash until she escaped by jumping out of a speeding car, police said today.

Robert Felix Gonzales, from Denver, was charged on Thursday with multiple violent and sex crimes, including trafficking in children and sexual assault.

Investigators say he met the girl when she was 14 and living with a foster family. The grandmother told Arvada police that the teen ran away but lived with Gonzales during 2011 and 'had been approved by social services'.

Gonzalez is accused of having sex with her and later pimping her on Craigslist to at least 30 strangers in various hotels throughout the district.

Pimp or boyfriend? Robert Felix Gonzales has been accused of prostituting a teenage runaway for nearly two years until she escaped by jumping out of his speeding car

According to the Denver Post, investigators repeatedly tried to rescue the girl but they say she would always return to Gonzalez - who would keep her hidden behind a false wall in his basement.

The teen eventually jumped out of the car to escape Gonzales in July, but initially wouldn't cooperate with authorities. In September of this year she confided in them.

She said she met the 39-year-old through her foster family and fell in love with him. She believed he had the same feelings but shortly after they ran away together things changed.

He would make her stay in motels, give her drugs and alcohol, have sex with her and often have men join in their sexual encounter, according to the affidavit.

He started to advertise her on Craigslist and often used naked pictures of her, she said, adding that Gonzales assaulted her if she tried to refuse and that he 
participated in approximately one-quarter of the sex acts.

The Denver Post reports that Gozalez would beat her so hard he broke his hand after hitting her face with such force.

Hideout: Police were called to Gonzalez's home several times but could never find the teen because he had erected a false wall and hid her behind it in a crawlspace

The teen told police she would accompany him to the hospital and though she had visible cuts and bruises, no one ever treated her or asked her about anything.

She was finally rescued from Gonzalez's home on July 25, 2012, and was placed in a group home - which she also ran away from.

One officer noted while he was interviewing her that she had the same tattoo as Gonzalez - a Chinese symbol which means 'eternity'.

Gonzalez was arrested and pleaded guilty to harboring a minor in May of this year. On July 24, he was sentenced to three years' probation with a suspended jail sentence.

It was two days prior to this the teen jumped from his speeding car, saying she had had enough of being used. She only told police about the relationship in September.

Gonzalez is being held at the Jefferson County Jail on a $500,000 bond.

He has been charged with trafficking in children, pandering of a child, two counts of a pattern of sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust, soliciting for child prostitution, procurement of a child, keeping a place of child prostitution, pimping of a child, inducement of child prostitution, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, harboring a minor and four counts of committing a violent crime.
