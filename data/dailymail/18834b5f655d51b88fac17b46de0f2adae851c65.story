Somi Guha, 36, said she is proud for standing up to Jeremy Clarkson and the BBC in another of his infamous race rows

The actress who took a stand against Jeremy Clarkson after he made a racist joke during an episode of Top Gear said she is proud of her actions.

Indian-born Somi Guha revealed how she was inundated with nasty comments from Top Gear fans after publicly criticising Clarkson's use of the word 'slope' - a derogatory word for those of Asian descent - in a Burma special.

But today Ms Guha, from Tower Hamlets, east London, said she is glad she took a stand - and would happily do it again.

She told the Sunday Mirror: 'I'm glad I did what I did - and if I hear Jeremy Clarkson make any more racist comments on TV I won't hesitate to do the same thing.'

Ms Guha admits she was not prepared for the backlash she would face after tackling the BBC under equality laws.

After being offended by the use of the word, which was aired in March this year, Ms Guha sought advice from Equality Justice, which previously worked on allegations of racism surrounding reality show Celebrity Big Brother.

Her lawyers sent a formal complaint to the head of the BBC Trust Lord Patten.

But the actress - who was in 2006 sci-fi movie Children of Men and has also appeared in hit ITV show The Bill - told the paper how Twitter trolls created fake accounts under her name, which were then targeted by Clarkson fans.

She said: 'It shows what can happen when you stand up to someone bigger and more powerful than you.'

She added: 'The Top Gear presenters seem determined to make racist comments.' 

The row broke out after the three hosts - Richard Hammond, James May and Jeremy Clarkson - were tasked with building a bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand during the series finale.

After completion, Clarkson said: 'That is a proud moment, but there's a slope on it', as a man walked towards him on a makeshift bridge.

Co-presenter Richard Hammond, 44, replied: 'You're right, it's definitely higher on that side.'

In her formal written complaint to the BBC, she says: 'Casual racism in the media by established BBC stalwarts is constantly brushed aside.

'Discrimination within the industry is accepted. Racial profiling of roles is accepted and expected.

'I find it offensive that Jeremy Clarkson refers to people of different races in pejorative terms.

What is that saying to children who watch him? - that it's OK to bully and make racist comments.

'Jeremy Clarkson has made derogatory comments about Mexicans. Now he bullies an Asian person. It has to stop.'

Last week, Ofcom ruled the BBC was in breach of its code for airing the controversial episode. 

Last week, Ofcom ruled that the BBC had failed to check whether the scripted word said by Clarkson would offend viewers

An Ofcom spokesman said the broadcaster had included an 'offensive racial term' which was 'not justified by context'.

It said: 'Jeremy Clarkson used the word 'slope' to refer both to an Asian man crossing a bridge, and the incline of the bridge.

'This was scripted in advance. The BBC failed to take the opportunity, either during filming or post-production, to check whether the word had the potential to offend viewers.'

In its representations to Ofcom, the BBC said programme makers were aware the word was 'used to refer to people of Asian origin' but they considered 'such use was mere slang'.

It added they were not aware it had the potential to cause offence outside the UK and would not have used it, had they been aware.

Following the Ofcom ruling, the BBC said: 'We dealt with this matter some time ago, the programme apologised at the time and explained the context, and we are now focusing on delivering another series of one of Britain's best loved shows.'

Lawrence Davies, from Equal Justice, said it was fantastic that Ms Guha had found the strength to fight against the comment.

Just weeks after the furore, Clarkson was forced to deny allegations that he was caught on camera using the n-word during filming of the hit BBC series.

In unaired footage the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

After the footage emerged, calls were 
made for Clarkson to be sacked. He initially denied the claim but later 
issued an apology.

That was not the first - or last time - that Jeremy Clarkson has sparked controversy with some of his comments.

Weeks later, in unaired footage of the series, the 54-year-old presenter was heard reciting the rhyme 'eeny, meeny, miny, mo' before apparently muttering 'catch a n***** by his toe'.

It took place during filming of the third episode of Top Gear series 19 as the star reviewed the £25,000 Toyota GT86 and the Subaru BRZ - which costs around the same amount.

Clarkson became embroiled in a second race row, just weeks after the 'slope' controversy

Telling viewers that they may find it difficult to differentiate between the two vehicles he demonstrated how to do it using the child's counting rhyme.

After initially denying the claims, Clarkson 'begged' for forgiveness, saying he 'did everything in [his] power to not use that word', but that his 'efforts weren't quite good enough.'

Jeremy Clarkson was also accused of racism for naming his black West Highland terrier dog Didier Dogba after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba, who is from the Ivory Coast.

Clarkson, who often mocks political correctness, asked: ‘Why is it racist to name our amazingly brilliant dog after a footballer?’

In December 2011, the controversial host came under under fire for suggesting public sector strikers 'be shot in front of their families'.

Weeks later, he provoked a fresh storm of protest after describing people who kill themselves by jumping under trains as 'selfish'.

In his newspaper column in The Sun, Clarkson wrote that ‘foxy woxy and the birds’ should be left to ‘nibble’ at the ‘gooey parts’ of people who die by jumping in front of trains.
