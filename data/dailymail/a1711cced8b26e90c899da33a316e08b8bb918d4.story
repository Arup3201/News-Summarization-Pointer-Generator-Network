Yankees general manager Brian Cashman allegedly hacked into his mistress's emails and ordered her mother to have her committed in a desperate bid to keep their affair secret.

Cashman, who was married at the time, accessed Louise Meanwell's messages 28 times over three days in 2012 after she threatened to expose him, court papers delivered to Manhattan Supreme Court on Thursday allege.

He found her mother's number in the contact book and warned her to keep Meanwell quiet, the suit continues.

The case, reported by the New York Post, is the latest in a bitter legal feud between Cashman and Meanwell - who also goes by the last name Neathaway - that has spanned two years.

'Threats': Cashman allegedly called Louise's mother Caroline Meanwell telling her to keep her daughter quiet

British native Meanwell, 39, claims she had a 10-month affair with Cashman, 47, and that he promised to divorce his wife to be with her.

However, the court papers say, it transpired he was also seeing another mistress and had no plans to leave Mary Bresnan, his wife of 17 years.

Meanwell began sending dozens of texts and emails a day warning she planned to expose their liaison, she claims.

In response, Cashman allegedly hacked Meanwell's emails and found her mother's contact details.

A suit filed by Meanwell's mother Caroline in January last year accused Cashman of using scare tactics to force her into helping them.

The suit claims he told her that the only three options left for her daughter were that, 'She will be committed, she will be arrested' or 'she will commit suicide and end up dead.'

Cashman's attorney Eric Creizman, it continues, put the emphasis on 'and end up dead' as an ominous warning so that Meanwell would cooperate with them. 

Days later, on January 31, 2012, Meanwell filed a computer trespass complaint claiming a foreign IP address had accessed her email 28 times, the Post reports. 

'No plans to divorce': Cashman, who has now separated from wife of 17 years Mary, allegedly promised Meanwell he would file for divorce to be with her. She claims she discovered he had another mistress

'The intent of Cashman's call to Meanwell's mother was an attempt to silence and or discredit Meanwell, to wit Cashman in concert with others attempted to induce Meanwell's mother to assist in having Meanwell falsely committed to a psychiatric facility,' court papers read by the Post say.

'Cashman's desire to have Meanwell committed was to cover up his (Cashman's) marital infidelities,' the suit alleges.

'When Meanwell's mother asked Cashman how he (Cashman) obtained this private cell phone number, Cashman indicated that he (Cashman) had obtained the phone number from one of Meanwell's e-mails that he had hacked into.'

During the alleged affair, Meanwell was having trouble in the family court system after losing custody of her daughter, according to a suit she filed last year.

Battle: Louise Meanwell, who also goes by the last name Neathaway, was charged with stalking in 2012

On a drunken night together at the 36-year-old's apartment, Cashman bragged to her that he could use his power as Yankee's manager to help her, the suit said.

'One evening Cashman, after several glasses of wine, nuzzled up to Louise on her rooftop and in a seductive manner, whispered in her ear...that the Yankees control the universe and that he controls the Yankees and that he would help her custody battle.' 

Meanwell dropped the suit due to administrative reasons last year, before refiling her claims this year. 

Meanwell was charged with stalking, extorting $6,000 from Cashman and attempting to extort $15,000 from Cashman on February 1, 2012.

She denies the charges.
