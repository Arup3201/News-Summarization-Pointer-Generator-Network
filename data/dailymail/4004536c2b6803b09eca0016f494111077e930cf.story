A West End director has warned that theatres may need to bring in measures to curb the use of mobile phones after a nude performance was stopped because a man was suspected of filming the actors.

Actor David Judge interrupted the performance of Athol Fugard’s Statements, a play in which the two lead actors at naked for most of the time, after he and fellow cast member Jasmine Hyde thought they spotted a man in the front row using his phone continuously.

The actors suspected he was filming the show, but when he was questioned by staff at Jermyn Street Theatre, the man said he was texting his son who was ill.

Anthony Biggs, the theatre’s artistic director, told the Evening Standard: ‘Both actors were very concerned by what was happening.

‘Initially they just thought someone was texting, but the phone’s screen stayed on, and the man, who was just four feet away from them, seemed to be pointing it towards the actors.’

Theatre staff checked the man’s phone but did not find evidence of any footage of the play.

Mr Biggs warned mobile phones can ‘ruin the experience’ of theatre and new measures may have to be brought in to curb usage during shows.

Mr Biggs said theatres  may have to order audience members to leave if their phones go off and then ban them, ask them to hand in their phones at the beginning or even  use technology to block mobile phone and internet signals.

He added: ‘In a live show audiences are part of the performance, it’s totally different to the cinema, they can ruin the experience, for example when David had to come out of character, it broke the spell and ruined the show.

‘At the moment we are fighting against a tide, and this will continue to happen unless we address why  people cannot disconnect from their phone for an hour and a half to experience live theatre.’
