A pilot was forced to make an emergency mayday landing when a fire warning light came on in his cargo plane.

But instead of a blaze on board, the alert seems to have been triggered by extra 'humidity' coming from some 390 cows being carried on the plane.

The Korean Airways landing at Heathrow is one of 88 mayday calls reported to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) last year.

A pilot was forced to make an emergency mayday landing when a fire warning light came on in his cargo plane. But the false alarm was triggered by cows on board

A mayday landing is the highest level of emergency and is rarely used except in the most urgent cases.

Other reasons for using the international distress signal included low fuel levels, suspected terrorism and crew members being struck down with food poisoning and becoming unable to safely man the plane.

A spokesman for the CAA, which has released details of the calls, said it was a pilot’s discretion to call a mayday based on an assessment of a given situation on board the aircraft.

He said: 'It could be the result of some technical failure to the aircraft or a passenger being unwell.

'The pilot will declare the mayday to air traffic control and communicate the nature of the situation.

'The air traffic controller may then give the aircraft a priority landing and scramble airport fire and rescue service or medical assistance if required.'

In this case the fire alert was triggered while flying over the Irish sea.

According to the report a worried crew member was sent onto the main deck to investigate but saw no sign of smoke or fire. 

But following procedure they donned 
oxygen masks and started 'a controlled cabin depressurisation and rapid 
descent' - an emergency landing

After extensive checks on the 
aircraft, the pilot said he believed that the presence of the cattle led
to higher levels of humidity on board.

Cows are well known for producing high levels of methane gas - the second-most-significant heat-trapping emission.

Other alerts saw an Airbus A319 send out a mayday call as it reached Heathrow after the crew were told bags which had been loaded were for passengers not on board, sparking a bomb fear

It was a false alarm.

Two more planes coming into Stansted thought they were running out of fuel, with the crew of one so concerned, they sent an alert to be given priority landing.

The captain of a Boeing 737 was unable to continue flying after falling ill so the crew issued a mayday emergency call.

The plane was landed safely at Newcastle by the co-pilot.

Another 737 made and emergency landing shortly after take-off when the plane started to shake and there was a burning smell in the cabin. It was revealed to be a failed air conditioning unit.

An emergency was declared on a Fokker F27 plane coming into London City airport after the co-pilot became sick with food poisoning.

And a Boeing 747 jumbo jet had to dump its fuel and make an emergency landing back at Heathrow after one of its engines caught fire on take off.
