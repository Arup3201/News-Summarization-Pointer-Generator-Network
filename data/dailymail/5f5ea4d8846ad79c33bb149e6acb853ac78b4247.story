A man has made a very unusual find while he was out fishing for crabs at the beach.

Chris Johnson discovered a human skull in Mandorah, just near Darwin on Friday, which is believed to be a traditional aboriginal burial site.

Mr Johnson decided to post the interesting find on his Facebook page, which gathered a lot of comments from friends.

What a find : Darwin's Chris Johnson found a human skull at a beach on friday. He was told by police to go hide it in scrubland until they could investigate

It's believed police told Mr Johnson to go hide it in scrubland so they could investigate later

The Port Darwin resident notified police of his find, who then told him to hide it in the bushes until they could investigate.

He wrote, 'Yep! Called the Po Po (the police).. They want me to hide it.'

'They are going to come around ... One more pot to check! Maybe I'll find the rest along the way?'

One of his Facebook friends asked if he was pranking them about the find, but he assured them it was genuine. 

'Nah! Had to hide it! So me and the cops can find it ,' he wrote on facebook.

Mr Johnson, who brought in a haul of five crabs that day said he had found it as he packing away his fishing equipment.

Impressed with his find : Chris Johnson posted this pic on facebook 

'It's pretty heavy, it's like a bowling ball, it's all full of sand,' he told the ABC.

It's believed police told him they would call when they were leaving to investigate the find but apparently 'they never did'. 

'It's definitely still there. I just feel uneasy that there is a human skull sitting exposed out there in the bush,' he said.

Impressed with his find and the media attention it gained, Mr Johnson also posted a picture with the story of discovery in which he wrote, 'Just another day crabbing'.

It's not yet known whether Northern Territory police have visited the site or whether any action has yet been taken.

The ABC reported that police had contacted the Aboriginal Protection Authority regarding the discovery.
