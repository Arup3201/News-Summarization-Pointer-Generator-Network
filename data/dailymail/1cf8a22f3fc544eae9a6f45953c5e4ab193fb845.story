Shock: Former BBC Radio 1 DJ and TV  presenter, Mike Smith, pictured with wife Sarah Greene, died in hospital on Friday from complications following major heart surgery

Mike Smith may have kept his health problems secret from some of his friends before his death.

The former BBC Radio 1 DJ and TV  presenter, who was 59, died in hospital on Friday from complications following major heart surgery.

It was also claimed yesterday that the DJ never got over the death of a young man on one of his TV shows in the 1980s.

Michael Lush, 25, died after falling 120ft while rehearsing a bungee jump stunt for The Late, Late Breakfast Show, which Smith co-presented with Noel Edmonds.

It is believed Smith had not told a number of his closest friends in showbusiness, including fellow Radio 1 alumni Edmonds and Mike Read, that he was unwell.

‘Mike’s death was a shock for Noel,’ said a source close to Edmonds yesterday. ‘He saw him only six or seven months ago and he looked all right to him then.’

Another former colleague also said he had not heard about Smith’s health issues, adding that he appeared well when they last met at a media industry gathering within the past year.

Former TV producer Mike Hollingsworth continued: ‘He seemed absolutely fine. Like all of us he was getting a bit older and perhaps a bit slower, but it never struck me that there was any problem in his life.’

Mr Hollingsworth, who worked with Smith on BBC Breakfast Time in the 1980s, also said the broadcaster was haunted by Mr Lush’s death in November 1986.

The day after Mr Lush’s fall, Smith cancelled his Radio 1 show, describing it as a ‘terrible time’ after he and Edmonds met Mr Lush’s family.

Mr Hollingsworth, who was once married to former TV-am presenter Anne Diamond, said: ‘He carried it with him. I always thought he unfairly carried the can for a large part of that. To be honest, it never appeared to be his fault.’

He paid tribute to the former DJ, who moved from presenting to set up a company called Flying TV which provides helicopter filming services for broadcasters.

‘He brought a touch of sanity to things which could easily have got out of control – the Noel Edmonds show was a particular example. He was particularly good at keeping his feet on the ground,’ he said.

‘There are so many people who don’t know when the time has come to take a back seat or give way to others coming up.

‘He knew exactly how to do that both in his DJ career and when he became a current affairs presenter. He knew that his particular era was over and he changed careers. He was the sort of guy to reinvent himself very well.’

Smith presented Radio 1’s flagship breakfast show between 1986 and 1988, when Princess Diana named him as her favourite DJ. He also hosted Top of the Pops and the coverage of Live Aid in 1985, as well as a number of quiz shows.

Smith is survived by his wife, the former Blue Peter presenter Sarah Greene. They married in 1989, a year after they were both injured in a helicopter crash in Gloucestershire. They did not have children. Miss Greene thanked the staff at the hospital where her husband died for their care and compassion, and asked for her family and friends to be allowed to mourn him in peace.

Edmonds said in a statement: ‘I am totally stunned and heartbroken for Sarah and his family.

‘He was so much more than simply a presenter. Mike was that rare individual – the consummate broadcaster in an era when professionalism, dedication and hard work were truly valued. I am typing this through the tears. I wish I had told him more forcefully and frequently how much I admired his talent and valued his support.’

Mike Read added: ‘Mike was a very affable guy, fantastically business-like. It’s a real loss and has come as quite a shock.’
