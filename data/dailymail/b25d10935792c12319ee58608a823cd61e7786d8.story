Nothing beats a birds-eye view, but the best panorama of Paris up to now has been the 206-metre observation deck of the Eiffel Tower.

This week though, humans have been given a glimpse of how the world's most romantic city looks from an eagle's perspective as it soars through the sky.

A white-tailed eagle with a camera strapped to its back was released from the Eiffel Tower by its handler, flying over the Seine and down into the Trocadéro Gardens at 111 miles per hour.

The eagle's handler, Jacques Olivier Travers, is head of not-for-profit organisation FREEDOM.

The crowd-funding group aim to re-introduce the white-tailed eagle into its natural habitat in the French and Swiss Alps.

The species has been extinct from France for over 50 years, and to draw attention to their campaign, the eagle was released over Paris for the first time on September 28.

The bird is filmed gliding towards the city at breakneck speed, making a U-turn to face back towards the landmark tower, before landing to applause from the assembled crowd.

A Sony HDR-AZ1 Action Cam Mini mounted on its back captures the unique view.

The camera, Sony's answer to the GoPro, costs £279 and is two-thirds the size of previous models.
