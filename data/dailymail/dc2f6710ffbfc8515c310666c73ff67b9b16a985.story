Barack Obama has issued a blistering challenge to North Korea over its nuclear ambitions, warning leaders to 'pursue peace' or face the consequences.

In one of his starkest warnings to the dictatorship yet, the U.S. president said a failure to embrace international agreements would mean a future without dignity, respect or hope for its people.

Speaking alongside world leaders at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in neighbouring South Korea, Mr Obama said the
internationally-alienated nation needs to change its ways or risk 'more broken dreams' and 
'more isolation.'

His warning comes amid soaring tensions on the Korean peninsular, after images were revealed of the North's brand new missile launch pad, which its military leaders say will fire an 'earth observation satellite' next month.

But Seoul warned it might blow any North Korean rocket carrying a satellite out of the sky if it violates South Korean airspace as the United States said the launch amounts to a test of North Korea's rocketry.

'We are studying measures such as tracking and shooting down (parts) of a North Korean missile in case they stray out of their normal trajectory', said Yoon Won-shik, a vice spokesman at the Defense Ministry, adding: 'We cannot help viewing (the launch) as a very reckless, provocative act that undermines peace on the Korean peninsula.'

Mr Obama also stood by his pledge for a world without 
nuclear weapons, declaring flatly that the United States has more than 
it needs and could decrease its arsenal without threatening national security.

That assessment put him on a 
collision course with congressional Republicans who say any significant 
cuts would undermine the U.S. ability to deter aggression.

In unusually personal terms, Mr Obama said he spoke of his wish for further nuclear reductions as the president of the only nation ever to use nuclear weapons, as a commander whose country's nuclear codes are never far from his side, and as a protective father eager to erase the threat of nuclear annihilation.

the summit with outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao, who he pressed for help in dealing with North Korea.

'Treaties are binding. Rules will be enforced. And violations will have consequences. Because we refuse to consign ourselves to a future where more and more regimes possess the world's most deadly weapons.'

During their talk, Mr Obama and Mr Hu agreed to coordinate their response to any 'potential provocation' should North Korea launch a satellite.

The White House said Mr Hu indicated to Mr Obama that he was taking the 
North Korean issue very seriously and was registering China's concern 
with the government in Pyongyang.

Still,
Mr Obama aimed his most stern remarks to North Korea's leaders, saying the
internationally isolated country needs to change its ways because 
continuing down the same path will lead to 'more broken dreams' and 
'more isolation.'

His blunt remarks came a day after he
visited the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea and 
described the experience as akin to witnessing a 'time warp' of despair.

'By now it should be clear,' he said. 
'Your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the 
security you seek, they have undermined it. Instead of the dignity you 
desire, you are more isolated.'

Speaking at Hankuk University, Mr Obama said that the international community has made progress in reducing the threat of nuclear material but says 'we're under no illusions.'

'Even as we have more work to do, we 
can already say with confidence that we have more nuclear weapons than 
we need,' he said. 'I firmly believe that we can ensure the security of 
the United States and our allies, maintain a strong deterrent against 
any threat, and still pursue further reductions in our nuclear arsenal.'

Mr Obama also reiterated his warning to 
Iran, which the U.S. and its allies contend is defying its international
obligations by pursuing an illicit nuclear program. Obama said he would
discuss Iran in meetings later in the day with the leaders of Russia 
and China.

'Iran's leaders must understand that 
there is no escaping the choice before it. Iran must act with the 
seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands,' Obama said. 
'Iran must meet its obligations.'

Facing down Iran and North Korea, Mr Obama said a 'new international norm' was emerging to deal with the two nations' intransigence. 'Treaties are binding. Rules will be enforced. And violations will have consequences,' Mr Obama said. 'Because we refuse to consign ourselves to a future where more and more regimes possess the world's most deadly weapons.'

Mr Obama said the U.S. was also moving 
forward with Russia to eliminate enough plutonium for about 17,000 
nuclear weapons and turn it into electricity. And he heralded an earlier
agreement with Russia to reduce nuclear arsenals under the New START 
Treaty, which Mr Obama called 'the most comprehensive arms control 
agreement in nearly two decades.'

'When we're done, we'll have cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s,' he said.

Mr Obama also prodded Russia in a new way, saying he would seek discussions with Moscow on an unprecedented front: reducing not only strategic nuclear warheads, but also tactical weapons and warheads in reserve. He said he planned to discuss that proposition with Putin when they meet in May.

Mr Obama was to meet later on Monday with outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Former leader Vladimir Putin returns to the presidency later this spring after winning an election held earlier this year.Â
