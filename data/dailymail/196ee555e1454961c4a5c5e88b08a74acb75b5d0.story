A family of five had a lucky escape after arriving home to find their bathroom ablaze after sunlight reflected from a shaving mirror set their towels alight.

Pregnant mother-of-three Kate Liew arrived home to find her house in Bristol filled with smoke and her bathroom towels ablaze.

Mrs Liew, 35, called the fire service who were initially baffled as to how the fire could have started.

But after checks on the electrics proved fine, investigators believe the fire had been started by sun reflecting onto a towel from a nearby high-magnification shaving mirror.

The full time mother, who is pregnant with the couple's fourth child, said: 'I got home on Friday afternoon and there was a strong smell and I could see smoke.

'As I went upstairs the smoke got thicker but luckily the fire was over by the time I got home, as there was nowhere for it to spread.

'The towel had been completely destroyed by the fire - it was just a heap of ashes. It was very lucky that it had not caught onto something else.

'The fire service arrived and were baffled as to what happened. Initially it was thought it must have been something to do with the electrics.

'The light fitting for the pull cord was burnt and smoke damaged so we thought that must be right. But the fire service checked and there was nothing wrong with the electrics.

'A fire officer then told me it could be the sun coming through the window, reflecting off the shaving mirror and then onto a flammable towel.

'I cleaned the bathroom that morning and moved the mirror so the magnifying side was facing the window.'

Lucky escape: The couple - pictured with their three children, Alfie aged five, Olly aged eight and Freddie aged three - called the fire brigade before the blaze managed to spread further

Mrs Liew, who lives with husband Allister, 34, and children Ollie, eight, Alfie, five and Freddie, three, added: 'It's important that people are aware of the dangers these mirrors can pose.

'I have three young children to look after and we are lucky that the towel did not set fire to anything else.

'The fire service, who were absolutely brilliant, certainly thinks we had a very lucky escape.

'These magnifying mirrors are common now in many bathrooms and can be bought very cheaply.

'I feel that the public need to be warned of this fire hazard risk, and perhaps manufacturers should put a warning on their mirrors.

'They put warning signs on cups of coffee to say they are hot so why not explain the fire risk on bathroom mirrors?'

Avon Fire and Rescue are now advising householders to think about the positioning of magnifying mirrors, in relation to windows, and to consider any possible fire hazards which could be caused by the sun being reflected by these mirrors.

A spokesman for Avon Fire and Rescue service said: 'At 2.42pm on Friday we were called to a private house in Chelsea Park, Easton, where there had been a small fire involving a towel on an electric hand-rail.

'It is believed that the fire happened sometime between 9am and 2pm that day in a converted en-suite bathroom situated in the loft of the building.

'It is believed that the fire may have been accidentally started as a result of the sun being reflected onto the hanging towel by a high-magnification shaving mirror nearby.

'Crews provided fire safety advice to the occupiers of the property. Householders are being advised to think about the positioning of magnifying mirrors, in relation to windows, and to consider any possible fire hazards which could be caused by the sun being reflected by these mirrors.'
