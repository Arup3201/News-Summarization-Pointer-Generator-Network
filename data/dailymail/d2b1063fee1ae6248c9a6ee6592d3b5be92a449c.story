Larger than a five pence piece, this huge hornet invaded a family home and took  ten minutes to die after it was sprayed with poison.

The huge insect, which measured 2.5inches, was feared to be a potentially lethal Asian hornet, which are feared to be heading to Britain from France.

It flew into the kitchen of  Rebecca Smith's home in Baldwins Gate, Staffordshire, and even after her partner Michael Elwell doused it in fly spray it continued to tear around the couple's home before it finally died ten minutes later.

Insect: Larger than a five pence piece, this insect was feared to be a 'killer' Asian hornet. It invaded a family home and took ten minutes to die after it was sprayed with poison

Experts at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)'s National Bee Unit have confirmed that the insect is not an Asian hornet, and was in fact a native European hornet.

Nevertheless, the couple and Mr Elwell's children Hannah,16, and 12-year-old Jake, are desperately searching for a potential nest in their garden, and say they are nervous of entering rooms in their home should they come across another insect.

Asian hornets have already been spotted in France and could find their way to the UK via freighter, or even by flying across the channel.

The insects are smaller than British hornets, and have been blamed for the deaths of six people in France who died from anaphylactic shock after being stung.

Nature experts also fear that should the hornets make it to Britain they could threaten the already dwindling population of honeybees - which they poison and use to feed their larvae.

Ms Smith, 36, spotted the  winged insect as she went to fetch her stepchildren ice lollies from the freezer on Monday, before calling Mr Elwell, 46, to the rescue.

'I went into the kitchen to fetch two ice lollies for the children and saw it on the window,' she said.

Migration: The hornets are believed to have first arrived in France on a shipment of Chinese pottery in 2004. As yet there have been no confirmed sightings in the UK

'It was quite big, around 6cm and I 
locked it in the room because I wanted to kill it. It was quite scary 
and I feared for young Hannah and Jake.

'I quickly called for my partner to 
help and he came in with some sort of spray and killed it, I didn’t want
 the thing to escape in case it stung someone.

'I was quite shocked as I have never seen one before and certainly didn’t expect to see one at home.

'It just looked like a huge wasp, I don’t know much about them but it is obvious they are quite dangerous.

'I think it was just a one off and I 
haven’t locked anyone in the house, the windows are still open and we 
are just hoping we don’t get another one.

'My partner has had a look and we haven’t seen a nest anywhere but you just never know, we are on high alert now.'

Ms Smith’s friend Carl Barnett, added: 'It is definitely a good-sized one.

'I’ve seen plenty of hornets and wasps over the years but nothing quite this big.

'It looks nasty and I certainly wouldn’t want to be stung - that would be painful.'

Asian hornets are believed to have first arrived in France on a shipment of Chinese pottery in 2004.

As yet there have been no confirmed sightings in the UK.

'We don’t want the Asian hornet established in this country as it would become yet another pressure on the already declining population of honey bees here,' said Craig Slawson, a co-ordinator at Staffordshire Ecological Records.

'At the moment there are reports of them in northern France, but the Channel is acting as a water barrier and they have not tried to come over - yet.

'However, if conditions change and there are prevailing winds, there is every likelihood it could appear over here.'

Concern has been raised about the potential arrival of the Asian hornet in the UK as they are known to attack honey bees - numbers of which are already dwindling.

There are now just 25 native species of honey bee in the UK and numbers may be as low as 50,000 at the height of summer.

Some experts say the hornets eat as many as 50 bees a day, and Government scientists are drawing up a rapid response plan to combat the arrival of the deadly Asian hornet on our shores.

The insects, which have the Latin name vespa velutina, are smaller than a British hornet, with queens growing up to 3cm in length, and workers up to 25mm.

Their bodies are dark brown or black, and bordered with a yellow band, while they have one band across the abdomen. Their legs are brown with yellow ends and they have an orange face.

They only fly during daytime hours, unlike the European species.

An Asian hornet's sting is thought to be no more painful than that of a British hornet to humans.

'There have been no confirmed sightings of Asian hornets in the UK – they are smaller than our own native hornets and are no more dangerous,' said a spokesman from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).

'We are aware of the potential impacts they could have on honey bees and have plans in place to eradicate them if they are identified.

'In Great Britain we would not expect Asian hornets to establish outside southern parts of England and Wales due to colder weather.'
