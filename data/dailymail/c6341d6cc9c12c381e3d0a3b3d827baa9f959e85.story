If you look closely, you just about tell who is who – despite the decades that separate these pictures of Status Quo.

Time, drugs and alcohol may have taken a toll, but the band’s original members are out to prove they can still rock as they reunite for a UK tour some 32 years after they last shared a stage together.

Rick Parfitt admitted it had taken eight days of rehearsals for the band to gel, but they are now raring to go in spite of their combined age of 257.

They can also count a total of nine wives and 17 children between them, and estimate they spent millions on drink and drugs during their days of rock ’n’ roll excess. The group, which has had 11 different band members over the past 51 years, was founded by South London schoolfriends Francis Rossi and Alan Lancaster in 1962.

They were joined by Parfitt and John Coghlan, and went on to sell 120million albums. They have had 65 songs in the British charts – more than any other band – with hits including Rockin’ All Over the World and Down Down.

The original line-up disbanded in 1981 when Coghlan walked out. Lancaster left in 1985. Parfitt and Rossi continued to tour as Status Quo, before the ‘Frantic Four’ agreed to reunite after meeting last year. The nine-date tour begins on Wednesday and will end at Wembley Arena on March 17. Here, we profile the rock ’n’ roll veterans:

Rick Parfitt, 64, OBE:

The guitarist thinks he has spent £1million on drugs over his career and once threw the contents of his dining room into a swimming pool while high on cocaine and alcohol. Married three times, he has had five children. Daughter Heidi from his first marriage drowned in the family pool when she was two. In 2006 he married third wife Lyndsay Whitburn and the couple now live in Spain with their five-year-old twins. Parfitt had a heart attack in 2011, has quit drugs, and only has the occasional bottle of wine. ‘I have a lovely and very relaxed life now,’ he says.

Francis Rossi, 63, OBE:

He overcame a huge cocaine habit which he says lasted between 1979 and 1987 and was so bad it destroyed his nose. The guitarist, who has eight children from two marriages, lives in Surrey with second wife, Eileen, to whom he has been married for 24 years. He claims he spent almost £1,500 a week on cocaine during the 1980s and his daily regime consisted of two bottles of tequila, three grams of cocaine and ‘hundreds’ of cigarettes. Today he says he smokes ‘only five cigarettes a day’, takes homeopathic remedies and enjoys crosswords and clay pigeon shooting. He said: ‘As I’ve grown up, I realise I just want to stay alive. I get up at 7am and go to the gym five days a week now.’

Alan Lancaster, 64:

The bass player moved to Australia with his second wife Dayle at the height of Status Quo’s success to escape the drink and drug problems engulfing the band. The couple, who wed in 1976, have two grown-up children. He also has a son from his first marriage. He filed a lawsuit to stop Rossi and Parfitt from continuing to perform as Status Quo, which was settled out of court. He has worked as a music teacher, but  in 2000 suffered a reaction to his hair dye which affected his nervous system. He initially lost the use of his right leg, arm and hand, but has recovered. Of his 23 years with the band, he said: ‘We were wild and rebellious, but the drinking and drug taking did a lot of damage.’

John Coghlan, 66:

He was a mechanic in South London before joining the group as a drummer in 1963. He walked out in 1981 after kicking over his drum kit in a drunken rage. He says his biggest vice was alcohol, admitting: ‘I’d drink anything in those days.’ After leaving the band he moved to the Isle of Man to change his lifestyle. He formed John Coghlan’s Quo to perform Status Quo hits. He has a daughter from his first marriage and now lives in Oxfordshire with second wife Gillie. The pair married in 1982. He says: ‘The days of heavy drinking have gone. I’m 66 now, so I have to look after myself.’
