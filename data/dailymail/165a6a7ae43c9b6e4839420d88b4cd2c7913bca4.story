A deaf man killed an actor with one punch after signing ‘watch me’ to a friend, a court has heard.

Matthew Powe, 30, attacked 34-year-old Vitalis Katakinas, who was also deaf, at a pub in Highbury, north London after a British Sign Language event, last June, a jury heard.

It came after the thespian, who was also deaf, knocked his glasses off, the Old Bailey was told.

Both men had been to the event before making their way to the White Swan pub in Highbury, north London, last June.

Powe had quarrelled with Mr Katakinas and another man before he knocked the victim out with one punch, jurors heard.

Father-of-one Mr Katakinas, from Lithuania, suffered a serious head injury and died in hospital one week later.

Described
 as an inspirational actor, the victim had won accolades for his 
performance in Deafinitely Theatre’s hit production of Shakespeare’s 
Love’s Labour’s Lost.

Powe, of Haringey, north London, denies murder and an alternate charge of manslaughter.

Prosecutor Alan Kent QC said: ‘On Saturday, 29 June 2013, the deceased Vitalis Katalinas travelled with his fiancee Lina Kankevicinti from their home in south east London to the British Sign Language Pride event in the park at Highbury Fields as did many, many other people.

‘Once the event finished some of those who had attended went to the pub afterwards, a pub called the White Swan, which is a Wetherspoon Pub near Highbury and Islington Underground station.

‘It was there, sometime around 11.30pm on that Saturday that Vitalis Katalinas the man who died became involved in an argument with another man, not this defendant.

‘The defendant Matthew Powe intervened and unfortunately the argument descended into violence.

‘There is some evidence that Mr Katalinas struck the first blow, he punched the defendant in the face or pushed him, that caused the defendant’s glasses to fall off.

‘He bent down, picked them up and put them back on.

‘Having done so he signed to a friend ‘watch me’ and punched Vitalis Katalinas in the face.

'That punch knocked Mr Katalinas to the ground and indeed it seems that the defendant also ended up on the ground.

‘But Mr Katakinas was probably unconscious from that first punch and he in fact never regained consciousness.

‘He died in hospital seven days later on Saturday, 6 July.’

Powe claims he was acting in self defence but Mr Kent said he attacked his victim in retaliation.

The court heard the fight started between Mr Katakinas and another man Thomas Giddens, a friend of his fiancée Lina, who he planned to marry this year.

Mr Katakinas was said to have been 'jealous' at how close they were and a few days before the deaf event Mr Giddens allegedly sent him a Facebook message saying: 'Go f*** yourself'

Mr Katakinas was said to have been ‘jealous’ at how close they were and a few days before the deaf event Mr Giddens allegedly sent him a Facebook message saying: “Go f*** yourself.”

When they came face to face on June 29, jurors heard Mr Katakinas beckoned Mr Giddens over and an argument broke out.

Mr Kent said there was 'clearly an atmosphere'  and Mr Katakinas became very 'animated and direct' in his sign language.

His fiancée tried to stop it but when Mr Katakinas told her not to interrupt she went off with a friend.'When she returned Vitalis was on the ground,' the prosecutor said.

‘In summary the defendant admits punching the deceased but says that he was acting in lawful self defence and says his actions weren’t unlawful,’ he said.

‘The prosecution case is that this defendant was acting out of retaliation of revenge and it wasn’t self defence and was therefore unlawful.

‘We say that in hitting the deceased as he did the defendant must have intended to cause him at least really serious bodily harm.’

A team of sign language interpreters are translating the trial to him.

The attack was witnesses by a number of deaf people who had also attended the British Sign Language event, the court heard.

‘As this incident took place outside a busy pub in a London street there were many witnesses,’ Mr Kent said.

The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.
