'We can confirm that there was an individual fatally injured at a facility where agency work is done,' White said. 'He was rushed to a local area hospital where he subsequently died. Due to privacy reasons and out of respect for the family, we are not releasing additional information at this time.'

A source also told the Beacon that the man was a middle manager and that the man jumped from the fifth floor of a Fairfax County building.

CIA employees are known to work under stressful conditions and high stress is considered part of the job, the website adds. It notes that employees usually hold jobs as intelligence analysts and support personnel, technical services operators, or as members of the clandestine services.

The CIA uses multiple 'semi-secret' locations, including Tysons Corner in Virgina, as well as safe houses, the website adds.
