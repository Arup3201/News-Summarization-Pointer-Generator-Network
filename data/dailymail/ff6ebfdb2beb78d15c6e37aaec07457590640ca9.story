Both northern Indiana 17-year-old girls badly hurt in a Florida 
parasailing crash have recovered enough for return trips to their home 
state.

The family of 17-year-old Sidney Good of Roanoke confirmed she was released from hospital in Panama City, Florida and flown back to Indianapolis.

After extensive surgery to save her life in the wake of the July 1st accident, Good was even well enough to take her first steps on Saturday - to the delight of her parents.

Good and friend Alexis Fairchild, 17, of Huntington were injured after the rope connecting them to a boat snapped and they slammed into a condominium, hit a power line and struck a parked car.

Dramatic cellphone footage shows both girls hitting the balcony of the condo as hundreds of beach goers scream out loud as they watch the horrifying accident unfold.

On the evening of the accident, both girls underwent brain surgery, but Good continued to suffer brain trauma that stopped doctors from working on her broken neck for several days.

Good eventually had surgery to alleviate the swelling of the brain and to remove a bood clot and one week after the July 1st accident, doctors ruled her well enough for surgery to repair her broken neck.

Once that surgery was completed successfully, Good was taken off a ventilator and now doctors are working towards reconstructive surgery on her facial injuries.

Good's family released the following statement on Sunday:

'On Saturday, Sidney Good was able to stand up and walk for the first time since her parasailing accident on July 1 in Panama City Beach,' reads the statement. 

'She walked just a short distance to a chair where she was able to sit up to eat.  Over the past few days she has been talking with us more and memories of the day of the accident are coming back.

'Sunday morning, Sidney was released from Bay Medical Center and flown to Indianapolis for further evaluation and possibly more surgery. 

'She is not yet ready for a rehabilitation hospital and will not be at the same hospital as Alexis, but we look forward to getting them together again sometime soon.'

On Friday, Alexis Fairchild was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital in Indianapolis.

Parents: The fathers of Alexis Fairchild and Sidney Good, the two best friends who smashed into a 13th floor Florida condominium after their parasail line snapped free, asked the public to pray for them

Mike Fairchild said at a news conference Friday his daughter, Alexis, "still has a long way to go" in her recovery Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana in Indianapolis, about 90 miles south of her Huntington home.

She suffered broken bones in the upper part of her spine, a skull fracture and a brain injury. She was released from the Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Fla., on Thursday.

'I really don't know how long she's going to be here, but I feel like she's in good hands here,' Fairchild said.

Doctors are doing assessments to see what Fairchild's capabilities are and what her immediate and long-term needs may be.

'She's going to be working very hard for us,' said Lisa Lombard, RHI's medical director.

Fairchild's father said she has not talked much about what she has been through.

'She hasn't talked a whole lot about it, because it's tragedy, you know,' Fairchild said. 'In time, she'll be able to speak more on that.'

Fairchild was discharged from Bay Medical Center in Panama City, Florida on Thursday to return to her Indiana home.

The 17-year-old will continue rehab for her horrifying injuries after she and friend Sidney Good smashed into a 13th floor Florida condominium when their parasail line snapped free on July 1.

The girls suffered head trauma and lacerations. Miss Fairchild had serious back injuries and Miss Good had trauma to her neck.

Miss Good is due to have reconstructive surgery on her face but no date has been set because she is still unable to get out of bed, her family told the News Herald of Panama City. She will remain the Florida hospital.

An investigation is ongoing into the incident.

The teens' fathers Eric Good and Mike 
Fairchild said during a press conference last week that their girls were showing steady signs of improvement but still 
have a long way to go.

Their parents said in a joint statement, 'Both girls sustained head 
trauma as well as multiple severe lacerations. Alexis has severe back 
injuries and Sidney has neck trauma.

'However, we are fortunately seeing 
some positive signs from both Sidney and Alexis.'

'Alexis was able to walk today 
with a walker and the assistance of a physical therapist and she walked 
into Sidney's room to visit.

'Sidney is still in critical condition, but 
we are seeing small signs of progress. She is able to open one of her 
eyes and communicate to us with nods and gestures,' said the Good and 
Fairchild families.

'We truly can't say enough about the outpouring of kindness and concern we've received from so many.'

Reeling: According to witnesses the girls were 
screaming in terror as they approached the complex and the wind blew 
them straight down into a power line (right)

The accident on July 1 that put both girls in hospital horrified onlookers.

The two lifelong friends were on holiday from their hometown of Huntington, Indiana and were parasailing together when the boat their parasail was attached to dropped anchor due to unusually high and dangerous winds.

However, the parasail rope snapped free from the boat and the girls began to scream as they drifted at the mercy of the wind.

They were taken higher and higher and then the two terrified teenage girls crashed into the balcony of a 13th floor condo then collided
 with power lines before landing on top of a car in a nearby parking 
lot.

Earlier
 in the day, Alexis Fairchild had taken to Twitter to speak of her 
delight at her Florida vacation on the Gulf shores, writing 'Beach Day!!
 Its seriously sooo beautiful here!'.

'These two little girls were just screaming bloody murder,' said Rick McGee speaking to Indiana News Center.

'I could see they were going to contact the condo, and they did strike it on the gulf side.'

The two teenagers have both gone through a series of surgeries to save their lives and in a piece of good news, their friend Allie Marks took to her own Twitter feed to write that 'Sid opened one eye this morning tried to take her tube out. Alexis is in surgery or her back. Keep praying!!'
