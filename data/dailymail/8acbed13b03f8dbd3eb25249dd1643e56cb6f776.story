A Dallas, Texas tour company has sparked outrage with the questionable placement of John F Kennedy's face on a bus.  

An image of the president, who was assassinated there in 1963, is plastered on the side of the bus next to the words 'BIG THINGS HAPPEN HERE.'  

A reporter for Dallas Magazine took a picture of the bus's decoration and posted them online, and writes that in addition 'there is the rather unfortunate placement of the bus’s back door handle in the center of Kennedy’s forehead.' 

Inappropriate? A Dallas Tour company has been criticized for one of their tour vehicles, which has an image of JFK on the side next to the words 'Big things happen here' 

President Kennedy died after being shot in the head by Lee Harvey Oswald, while driving through Dallas with his wife. 

Now the owner of the tour company says he's received death threats for what he calls an 'honest mistake'.

Ricardo Hernandez had the bus wrapped about eight months ago, and says he never received a complaint before this week. 

History: President Kennedy was shot in the head while driving through Dallas with his wife in 1963. He died from a fatal head wound

'I looked it over and I never connected them...It was just a coincidence, just an honest mistake,' Mr Hernandez told MailOnline. 

While Mr Hernandez has covered up the words next to the assassinated president't head, he says he doesn't plan to move the image itself from its current position. 

He says the president's head wouldn't fit anywhere else on the bus, and it's likely it will always be partially obstructed by some part of the vehicle. 

Hernandez says only one bus has the design pictured on dmagazine.com. 

Response: Tour company owner Ricardo Hernandez has now covered up the lettering on the side of the bus, but plans to keep Kennedy's head in the same position
