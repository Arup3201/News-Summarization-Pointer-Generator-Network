American student Amanda Knox, who is facing a retrial in Italy in the murder of her roommate, received some good news this week when forensic experts revealed that there were no traces of the victim’s DNA on the alleged murder weapon.

On Friday, experts began tests on a kitchen knife that the Italian prosecutors claimed was used to murder British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia in 2007.

Two years ago, Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were cleared of all charges in connection to Kercher’s murder after they had served four years in prison for the crime.

Amanda Knox, 26, could be heading for another acquittal in Italy after forensic experts have failed to find any trace of Meredith Kercher's DNA on a knife that was alleged to be the murder weapon

Perugia police seized this large kitchen knife from her lover Raffaele Sollecito's apartment, where Knox allegedly had used it for cooking

In March, Italy's highest court ordered the new trial for the pair, overturning their acquittals.

The 26-year-old Knox, who has been attending college in Seattle since her return to the U.S., announced that she will not go to Italy to face another trial.

This latest revelation that skin cells found on the knife are not those of Kercher could refute the prosecution’s claim that Knox used the large piece of cutlery to kill the British national.

Following Kercher’s slaying in 2007, Perugia police seized the sizable kitchen knife from Sollecito’s apartment, where Knox allegedly had used it for cooking, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

DNA testing performed this week have shown that skin cells found between the handle and the blade are those of Knox, not Kercher.

The fact that Kercher's blood was not found on the blade could possibly spell a second acquittal for Knox when the retrial comes to a close November 26.

Knox’s attorney Ted Simon told ABC News Friday that he was satisfied with this turn of events in Italy.

Seattle, Washington, last month as she chatted on the phone while picking up 
supplies at a pet store ahead of the re-trial in Italy

Meanwhile, Sollecito's attorney, Luca
Maori, said that all evidence points to the fact that contrary to the 
prosecutors’ version of events, the knife that has become the 
centerpiece of the case against his client and Knox was not the murder 
weapon after all.

The forensic experts will officially unveil the results of the DNA tests during a court hearing November 6.

The appellate court hearing the new case could declare Knox's in contempt of court for failing to return to Italy for the trial, but that carries no additional penalties.

'We refute the idea that because Amanda is not coming, that Amanda is guilty, that Amanda is using a strategy.

'Amanda
always said she was a friend of Meredith's, Amanda has always respected
the Italian justice system,' Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga said before 
the trial opened.

Knox and Sollecito, now 29, were convicted and later acquitted in Ms Kercher's death.

Knox
served four years of a 26-year sentence, including three years on a 
slander conviction for falsely accusing a Perugia bar owner in the 
murder, before leaving Italy a free woman after her 2011 acquittal.

The
bar owner wrongly accused of killing Meredith Kercher today insisted 
that Amanda Knox is guilty of the British student's murder.

Patrick
Lumumba, who Knox initially suggested might be responsible for killing 
Meredith, told the hearing that he had suffered from the false 
allegation, which saw Knox convicted of slander.

Amanda Knox, pictured in Seattle at the weekend, left, has said her decision not to attend the re-trial for murdering fellow student Meredith Kercher, right, was 'common sense'

'I say the same thing I said six years ago,' he said. 'I think she is guilty, and that is why she slandered me.'

Francesco Maresca, representing the Kercher family, said that the 
victim's relatives believed Knox was present at the scene of Meredith's 
death in the flat the two students shared in Perugia.

'I think she is talking too much, sincerely, and this attitude of continuous playing the victim is inappropriate,' he added.

Knox
and her one-time lover Sollecito served four years in jail for the 
murder of Meredith, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the
flat she shared with Knox.

Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial.

In
June judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling 
by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies 
contradictions and illogical conclusions’.

Knox has said that her decision not to attend the re-trial was ‘common sense’.

‘I was imprisoned as an innocent person and I just can’t re-live that,’ said told NBC television.

In
a memoir released earlier this year, Knox sought to portray herself as a
naive young woman railroaded by a foreign justice system and not a 
callous sexual deviant as she was painted in many reports after her 
initial conviction.

Knox is not obliged to attend the retrial and can be represented by her lawyers. 

If found guilty, she would be able to appeal again, but Italy could apply for her extradition if that failed
