Motoring organisations last night welcomed a city’s ‘bold’ decision to scrap most of its bus lanes – and urged others to follow suit.

Liverpool is believed to be the first local authority in the country to remove bus lanes en masse after a successful year-long trial without them.

Motoring groups welcomed the move and said they hoped it would be the start of a new trend.

The AA said all councils should now review their use of the bus-lanes so that they were used only where absolutely necessary - and not simply to punish motorists for having the temerity to use their cars.

Liverpool is to remove nearly all of its bus lanes after a study found they were not working properly

In a victory for ordinary car drivers, Town hall chiefs declared the bus lanes, which prioritise passenger vehicles while restricting the amount of space left for drivers and other road users, ‘simply don’t work’.

An independent review recommending retaining just four of its 26 bus lanes was backed earlier by Liverpool City council’s cabinet.

Anti-car campaigners like bus lanes because – in the transport planners’ jargon - they ‘deny road-space’ to motorists, thereby artificially creating man-made traffic jams, while simultaneously allowing those in buses to get around the gridlock in their otherwise empty reserved lanes.

This sends a less than subtle message to drivers to leave their cars behind and use public transport. For these very same reasons the bus lanes are loathed by drivers.

Bus lanes boomed during the last Labour Government’s so-called ‘integrated transport policy’ which was dubbed a ‘war on motorists’ by opponents.

The most infamous bus lane on the M4 into London – dubbed the ‘Blair lane’ because the then Labour Prime Minster’s driver used it to speed Mr Blair out of the gridlock from Heathrow airport into the capital citing ‘security’ reasons for the VIP exemption .

It was scrapped within weeks by Conservatives within the coalition government getting into power in 2010.

Only four of the 26 lanes will be saved, if the city council approves, and they could operate at different times

Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson introduced his city’s bus-lane free trial in September 2013.

AA president Edmund King welcomed the move in Liverpool and hoped other towns and cities would follow suit.

He said: ‘Town halls should review where and when they operate bus lanes. Too many of them are not working. They may be operating 24 hours a day when there’s no need for it because the perceived traffic problem applies only for eight of them.

‘Bus lanes are like yellow no parking lines. They are not always necessary. Councils must review their blanket use.’

An RAC spokesman called the move ‘bold’, adding: ‘It’s interesting to see a city the size of Liverpool taking a very different approach to congestion and if it continues to be successful may well set a precedent for other UK cities to follow suit.’

Bus operator Stagecoach said it was an ‘irresponsible’ move which ignored the needs of ‘thousands of bus passengers’.

A Stagecoach spokeswoman said: ‘It is clear that the needs of the thousands of people who rely on bus services every single day across Liverpool are not seen as a priority by the city council.’

She said loss of bus lanes would increase journey times, adding: ‘We believe this is an irresponsible decision which could well come back to haunt them.’

The review by engineering consultant Mott MacDonald looked at issues such as changes in bus journey times, times of non-bus passenger numbers and accident statistics.

It examined traffic flow on three of the city’s main bus corridors - Prescot Road, between the Royal Liverpool Hospital and Alder Hey Hospital;, County Road, between Scotland Road and the M57 motorway; and Picton Road, between Edge Lane and Belle Vale - where the majority of the bus lanes are placed.

The report, which included data from researchers who travelled as bus passengers, said bus lanes only offered ‘marginal benefits’ along all three corridors.

It also found that buses were slowed down by on-street parking rather than other vehicles on the road. To address this councillors also approved moves to study the possibility of ‘red routes’ to deal with ‘indiscriminate street parking’.

Mayor Anderson also promised that roads where the lanes are scrapped will have better provision for cyclists.

Traffic Regulation Orders for the bus lanes will now be revoked with new orders introduced for the four remaining lanes.
