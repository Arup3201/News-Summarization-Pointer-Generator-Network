Brendan Rodgers is splashing his Luis Suarez cash - and the Liverpool boss looks more focused than ever as he looks to go one step better in the Premier League this season.

Suarez's £75million sale to Barcelona has opened up a transfer war chest for Rodgers - and he is set to splash £28.5m over the weekend with the arrivals of Southampton's Dejan Lovren and French striker Loic Remy imminent.

But back with his day-to-day work in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Rodgers is looking to get the best out of his existing charges, as part of what will be a strong squad competing at home and in Europe.

Liverpool are preparing for their fourth pre season game - against Olympiacos on Sunday evening - before being joined by Lovren and Remy next week once their paperwork goes through.

And Steven Gerrard was right in the mix of things as he gets ready for a campaign without England duty after announcing his retirement from the international stage.

Rodgers stood on the sidelines watching on intently - analysing where he next needs to splash the cash.
