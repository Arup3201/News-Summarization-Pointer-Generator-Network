So it turns out that the smartest folk in town this week were those at Madrid sports newspaper Marca. They were the ones who suggested as early as Monday morning that Liverpool were about to come to the Bernabeu and stick their reserves out.

Nobody believed the story but in the end they were right, which prompts a question for Liverpool supporters.

What is more worrying — the fact that your manager’s team plans are being leaked to the press in your opponent’s home town or that he should make a decision laced with such staggering lack of ambition in the first place?

Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. 

Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend.  

Liverpool starting XI v Newcastle: 

Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Balotelli

Liverpool starting XI v Real Madrid:

Mignolet, Manquillo, Toure, Skrtel , Moreno; Can, Lucas 7; Lallana, Allen, Markovic; Borini

Most of those standing flummoxed in the away section high up in the gods here last night were perhaps past caring about the small details by kick off.

The decision had been made and Liverpool, as a result, were finished before they even began. This was sport, but only in name.

It is hard to win at Madrid. Since 1957, only one English team apart from Liverpool has managed it. Arsenal in 2006.

The key fact here, though, is that the others have come to this magnificent stadium and tried.

To return to an earlier point, that is called sport. You turn up, take a deep breath, put your gloves on or your shin pads and you go out and try to do something special.

Bobby Robson tried with Ipswich here in 1973 and got a draw. Brian Clough lost 5-1 with Derby after winning a European Cup first leg 4-1.

He went home with a broken heart and a sense of injustice but at least he tried, just as David O’Leary did in losing 3-2 with Leeds in 2001.

His team led that night. Only for a minute, but just imagine what that minute must have felt like.

We could go on. We could talk about narrow failures here for both Manchester teams.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers can dress this team selection up all he likes.

He can call it pragmatic or realistic but it is neither of those things, really. It just felt fundamentally wrong and the fact that the defeat was narrow and the performance spirited does not change that.

The result should not serve as vindication of Rodgers’ methods. The scoreline was a fluke, reflective not of Real’s clear dominance but of the fact that Liverpool’s lack of competitiveness almost sent their opponents to sleep.

137 - The seven players on the Liverpool bench had made 137 Champions League appearances between them prior to kick-off last night. That’s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting XI. 

130 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Liverpool’s starting XI.

642 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Real Madrid’s starting XI. 

£59 -The cost of an away ticket at Bernabeu last night. Not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels.

27 - Shots at goal by Madrid last night. That’s 13 more than they managed in their 3-0 win at Anfield.

2 - Minutes played by Steven Gerrard at the Bernabeu prior to last night. He was a sub in a 1-0 win in 2009. He has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium.

3,669 - Tickets at the Bernabeu allocated to Liverpool fans. Rodgers’ team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796-mile round-trip. 

The game was played in an almost dreamlike atmosphere, as though Madrid knew they would win.

When they scored, in the 27th minute, the roof hardly came off the place.

By half-time, Real had taken 13 shots on goal to Liverpool’s none.

That is not what we hoped for when the draw threw these two great clubs together.

Afterwards, Rodgers’ stated belief in his own methods was impressive enough.

It is a relevant quality. He has not done much wrong since arriving at Anfield two summers ago but this selection flew quite spectacularly in the face of all he has preached.

Back then he talked romantically about sitting on the floor of his grandfather’s house watching great Liverpool European nights on TV.

What he will not have watched is Bob Paisley sending his stiffs out. Back then they didn’t even get on the plane, never mind the pitch.

Real are a very good football team. They were not the best team in Spain last season, though. Or, indeed, the second best. They lost five times, including twice at home.

Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle

They have improved since then and were far too good for Liverpool two weeks ago. In Rodgers’ mind, though, they have been clearly been built up in to a monster. He obviously believes them to be unbeatable and perhaps that is the greatest sin of all.

No manager — in any sport — should ever think that. If we all thought that way, we may as well scrap the FA Cup.

This was, in effect, a team selection designed principally to avoid collateral damage that may affect an entirely different game — against Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League — that is still three days away. And if that is the way a manager thinks, what chance do his players have?

Results can change seasons. Just one result. Who knows? For Liverpool, this could have been the one.

Liverpool fans who traveled to the Bernabeu may question Rodgers' decision to play a weakened team

Simon Mingolet (centre) rises to collect a cross and deny Cristiano Ronaldo an effort at goal

Instead, Liverpool now look like a team who feel they don’t belong in Europe, a team who arrive at the really big venues seeking purely to avoid a hiding.

Rodgers, meanwhile, must wait and see what this does for his own reputation — even if he claimed last night not to care.

Just two weeks ago, the Liverpool manager told another Spanish newspaper — AS — that he would like to work over here one day.

He may be waiting a while after this.
