A dramatic surge by the SNP looks set to claim Gordon Brown's Scottish seat and rob Ed Miliband of a Commons majority, according to a new poll last night.

The study of marginal constituencies suggests Labour and the Conservatives are heading for electoral deadlock in May, with neither party able to govern alone.

The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests the SNP is on course for a landslide at the General Election, winning as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats - up from just six at present.

The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft, suggests the SNP is on course for a landslide at the General Election, winning as many as 56 of Scotland's 59 seats - up from just six at present.

The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including those of departing Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, and former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy. The Tories are also in danger of losing their one Scottish seat, held by David Mundell.

At Westminster the poll suggests Labour and the Conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each - well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority. Lord Ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the SNP in the wake of last year's independence referendum had thrown a 'giant spanner in Labour's works', although the party is forecast to win Tory seats south of the border.

Of the eight Scottish seats polled, the SNP would gain six - including four from Labour - and tie with Mr Mundell, in Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale.

'It is hard to see things getting any worse for Labour in Scotland, while things are on a knife-edge elsewhere,' Lord Ashcroft said.

'But as things stand, Labour losses in Scotland could offset their gains from the Tories, leading to something close to a dead heat.

'This, then, is the battle: can the Conservatives fight back against Labour faster than Labour can fight back against the SNP?'

The poll throws up the prospect of a weak Ed Miliband government propped up by Nicola Sturgeon's SNP - she has ruled out supporting a Tory government. The two pardicts ties would have a combined total of 328 seats - producing a Commons majority of just three.

Former First Minister Alex Salmond, who is planning a return to Westminster, has refused to rule out becoming a government minister in the country he tried to break up as part of any deal.

And the SNP has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from Labour, including billions more in spending and borrowing, home rule for Scotland and the scrapping of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent.

The new polling suggests that the SNP will make deep inroads into Labour's Scottish heartlands, and all but eradicate the Lib Dems north of the Border.

Gordon Brown's Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country. But the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the SNP, giving the Nationalists a comfortable six-point lead.

In Edinburgh South West, where former Chancellor Alistair Darling is also stepping down, the poll pre-another SNP win, on the back of a 22 per cent swing.

In Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which Mr Kennedy has held since 1983, a 21.5 per cent swing to the Nationalists looks set to hand the seat to former SNP treasurer Ian Blackford.

Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, in Orkney and Shetland, could be left as the only Lib Dem MP in Scotland.

New Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is forecast to cling on in East Renfrewshire, despite a 20.5 per cent swing to the SNP. But, in this scenario, he could be one of only two Labour MPs remaining.

Mr Murphy last night said David Cameron would be 'rubbing his hands with glee' at the findings as they suggested the Nationalist surge could prevent a Labour victory.

He added: 'We can't let David Cameron back into Downing Street by the back door. That would be a disaster for Scotland, but it looks like that is what might happen if these polls in Scotland are repeated on election day.'

SNP election chief Angus Robertson described the findings as 'very encouraging' and showed the party was picking up seats across Scotland, including in areas that rejected independence, such as the Borders, where Mr Mundell is facing a knife-edge battle to cling on. A Scottish Tory spokesman said: 'This poll shows that the Scottish Conservatives are now in a real fight across Scotland.

'With the Liberal Democrat vote having collapsed completely, we offer Scots the opportunity to unite around a plan to finish the job of economic recovery and to secure Scotland's place in the UK - any other vote will let Ed Miliband into Downing Street, with Alex Salmond calling the shots.'

A Scottish Lib Dem spokesman added: 'These polls show that Lib Dems are best placed to stop the SNP in the Highlands and the North East. The SNP have centralised services away from the Highlands and the North-east to the central belt.'
