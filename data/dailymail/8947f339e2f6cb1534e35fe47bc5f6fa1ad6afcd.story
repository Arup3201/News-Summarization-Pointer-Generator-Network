Missed: Jacintha Saldanha pictured with her husband Ben Barboza

The tragic nurse who apparently killed herself after being hoaxed by a pair of Australian DJs is pictured here alongside her beloved husband.

Jacintha Saldanha, a 46-year-old mother 
of two, was found dead on Friday morning in nurses’ accommodation at the
London hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge had been treated for 
acute morning sickness.

Yesterday her husband Ben Barboza, 49, an NHS accountant, 
said: ‘I am devastated with the tragic loss of my beloved wife Jacintha 
in tragic circumstances.’

Today, flowers and tributes were left outside the hospital nurses' quarters, where Mrs Saldanha  was discovered.

And in a poignant message posted on 
Facebook, the couple’s 14-year-old daughter Lisha said of her mother: ‘I
miss you, I loveeee you.’

Mrs
Saldanha’s sister-in-law Celin D’Souza added: ‘I will really miss her a
lot. She was good-natured. I cannot forget her, she was so good.’

Three
days before her death, Mrs Saldanha was manning the hospital 
switchboard when she took a call from two Australian radio presenters – 
Mel Greig and Michael Christian – impersonating the Queen and Prince 
Charles.

They were transferred to the Duchess’s ward and broadcast confidential information given to them by a second nurse. Although she wasn’t blamed in any way for what happened, friends said Mrs Saldanha ‘took it very badly’.

Described as popular, quiet and 
‘profoundly caring’, she is said to have made clear to her family the 
depth of her anxiety when the prank was broadcast.

Others
have described her as feeling lonely and confused, though the hospital 
said it supported her and stressed she did not face any disciplinary 
action.

Mrs Saldanha’s 
husband raised the alarm after failing to reach her by phone on Friday. 
Friends said the speed with which he did so reflected his concern for 
her wellbeing.

Last night 
the chairman of the King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, wrote to the
owners of the radio station, 2Day FM, condemning the ‘humiliation of 
two dedicated and caring nurses’.

Tributes: Flowers were left outside the nurses quarters at the King Edward VII hospital

Poignant: Jacintha Saldanha was described as 'profoundly caring'

Tragic: The grieving family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha who died in a suspected suicide have told of their devastation at her death. She is pictured centre, with son Junal and daughter Lisha

Anxious: Although she wasn’t blamed in any way for what happened, friends said Mrs Saldanha ‘took it very badly’

Family grief: Jacintha Saldanha's Indian family, pictured, was informed about her death last night when her partner Benedict called in tears

In shock: Mrs Saldanha's Indian family spoke about their heartache today. Mother-in-law Carmine Barboza, 69, said: 'We just cannot believe what has happened'

Lord Glenarthur, chairman of the hospital, called the decision 
to broadcast the prank ‘truly appalling’ and said the consequence of the
presenters’ actions was ‘tragic beyond words’.

Caught
in an international backlash, Greig and Christian were yesterday in 
hiding, where they were said to be receiving medical assistance amid 
growing fears for their ‘physical and emotional wellbeing’.

While
it is not thought the presenters broke any laws, they are expected to 
be interviewed by police. Scotland Yard is preparing a report for Mrs 
Saldanha’s inquest and requires statements from them.

Yesterday the dead nurse’s family were being comforted by relatives and friends at their terrace home in Southmead, Bristol.

A friend who answered the door said Mr Barboza, Lisha and the couple’s 16-year-old son Junal were ‘very, very shocked and unhappy’.

Mrs Saldanha, from Valencia in south-west India, married Mr Barboza, from the nearby village of Shirva, in 1993. They moved to Bristol nine years ago. When she was working in London she lived in nurse’s quarters behind the hospital, returning to the family home on her days off.

Mr Barboza’s mother Carmine, 69, said the family returned to India to visit her every two years. She said neither her son nor daughter-in-law had told her about the hoax call.

‘Everything seemed normal,’ she said. ‘But then we got a call last night from Benedict informing us that Jacintha had died. He was crying and couldn’t speak much.

‘We don’t know whether we’ll be able to bring her body back to India but we desperately hope so.

‘We spoke to Benedict again this 
morning and he said he hasn’t been allowed to see her body yet because 
of legal formalities and she’ll not be handed over before Monday.

‘Jacintha was a very caring woman. We just cannot believe what has happened.’

Yesterday
a wooden cross with a British flag was left outside the King Edward VII
Hospital, while flowers were placed outside the nearby nurses’ block.

A
note read: ‘Dear Jacintha, Our thoughts are with you and your family. 
From all your fellow nurses, we bless your soul. RIP xxx’

Backlash: 2DayFM DJs Mel Greig, left, and Michael Christian, right, have been bombarded with abuse online since Jacintha Saldanha's death at King Edward VII hospital's lodgings was announced

Tragedy: Jacintha Saldanha transferred a prank call from two Australian DJs who found out intimate details about Prince William's wife Kate Middleton who was staying at the hospital suffering from morning sickness

Distraught: Mrs Saldanha's body was found at staff lodgings close to King Edward VII hospital in London yesterday

Neeraj
Singh, a former colleague who worked with Mrs Saldanha  at Southmeads 
Hospital in Bristol, said news of her death was ‘devastating’.

Mrs Saldanha once described herself as ‘a very nervous person’ in a testimonial penned for her driving teacher’s website.

Instructor
Jeff Sellick recalled her as quiet and sometimes needing a confidence 
boost, adding that he felt the prank call would have ‘played very heavy 
on her mind’.

DJs Greig and Christian have told station bosses they want to 'express their remorse publicly.'

Friends say ex-model Mel Greig is 
‘close to a breakdown’ and undergoing 'intensive psychological 
counselling' along with colleague Michael Christian - and both are being
'wrapped in cotton wool'.

Today their bosses at Southern Cross Austereo, 2Day FM's parent company,
said the tragedy of a nurse who took the call being found dead was 
'unforeseeable and very regrettable', insisting 'immediate action' was 
being taken.

The duo will provide statements to 
local detectives after a request from the Met to their New South Wales 
counterparts - and the company said they have 'expressed a desire to 
speak' to the media.

A spokesman for Southern Cross 
Austereo spokesman added today: 'We haven't ascertained when they're 
ready for that (to speak to the media) and how we're going to organise 
that, but they certainly want to.

'They are still being wrapped in cotton wool at the moment and we are very mindful of their situation.'

New South Wales Police deputy 
commissioner Nick Kaldas, confirmed the request, saying: 'It hasn't been
indicated to us that an offence has occurred and they have not actually
asked for anything yet.

'They've simply touched base, let us 
know of their interest and they will get back to us if they actually 
want something done,' he told Sky. 'Nothing has been requested of us 
yet.'

Bosses at Sydney radio station 2Day 
FM pleaded for sympathy for the breakfast show co-hosts as they faced a 
boycott by advertisers not wishing to be associated with their brand of 
‘humour’.

Scrum: John Lofthouse, right, the Chief Executive of King Edward VII hospital and Lord Glenarthur, second right, the hospital's Chairman, deliver a statement to the media outside the hospital following the death of the nurse

Sandy Kaye, a PR for the radio 
station, said: ‘We are very concerned for the well-being of our talent. 
They are very, very distressed. Mel is very vulnerable. She has been 
vulnerable in the past.

'So we are very concerned about her. 
She is in a very fragile state and we are concerned for her. We are 
giving them professional care. They are receiving counselling.’

Southern Cross Austereo is holding an
emergency board meeting to consider what action it should take over the
prank phone call, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Chairman Max Moore-Wilton added: 'The
chief executive officer (Rhys Holleran) is responsible for the 
operations of the organisation within the framework that the board 
broadly sets.'

Miss Greig’s father Sydney said at 
his home in South Australia: ‘I don’t know where she is. I can’t say 
anything. I am very concerned for her. I am not sure where this is 
going. I have spoken to her but I have been told not to say any more.’

A 2Day FM source said the two DJs were being looked after in the devastating wake of their show and were now both in ‘lockdown’.

A close friend of Miss Greig said: 
‘Everyone who knows Mel fears for her mental state. Yes, there are very 
real fears that she could self-harm and nobody wants that.

'Of course, she is blaming herself 
for what has happened. What was done in fun has turned out to be a 
horrible tragedy.  She is close to a breakdown.’

The station could face action over 
the fateful call as under Australian law it is illegal to record someone
or publish a taped conversation without the person’s permission.
