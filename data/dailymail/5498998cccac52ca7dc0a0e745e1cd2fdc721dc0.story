Mario Batali's Italian restaurant, Babbo, is being sued for $10 million by one of its neighbors over smell and noise complaints. 

Nurretin Akgul, who lives next-door to the star-studded eatery in Manhattan's trendy West Village, says he cannot sleep due to the kitchen's pungent garlic odors and noisy air conditioners.

He told the New York Post: 'I can smell everything they cook, the garlic, and when they use chemicals to clean the exhaust dust we get the stuff in our windows. It's really a nuisance.'  

Bad neighbor? Mario Batali's popular New York City restaurant Babbo is being sued for $10 million by a neighbor for being too loud and smelly

The suit alleges that Mr Akgul is having trouble sleeping because of the 'unrelenting vibrations and a chronic hum' from the restaurant's air conditioners. 

Mr Akgul says 'the humming is so intense, I cannot even open my window in the back.'

According to the suit, Mr Batali applied for a special permit required for a commercial eatery in a residential neighborhood last year.

It claims that Mr Batali promised that if Mr Akgul did not oppose the permit he would make sure that the restaurant stopped disturbing the neighborhood by, among other things, soundproofing its walls and dealing with the pervasive smell.

Mr Akgul argues that Mr Batali has not held up his end of the deal.

Jack Lester, Mr Akgul's lawyer. says that once Mr Batali was granted the special permit, 'he just turned his back on my client.'

Babbo is a favorite with the A-list, with fans including Katie Holmes, Robert Pattinson, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.

But of course, Mr Batali and Babbo are no strangers to controversy. Less than a year ago, the chef and his partner Joseph Bastianich were forced to pay $5.25 million to their employees for skimming 4-5% of cash off of tips. 

The plaintiffs also claimed that they were forced to work over 40 hour work weeks without even making minimum wage.

Both of the suit's two leaders were former employees of Babbo and one claims she was sexually harassed while working there and had the word 'rat' written on her locker after filing the suit.

Even though Mr Akgul's is the first formal civil suit, neighbors have been complaining about Babbo for years saying that the smells, noise, and crowds make the restaurant a terrible neighbor.

Mr Batali and his restaurant group have declined to comment to the Daily Mail on the lawsuit.
