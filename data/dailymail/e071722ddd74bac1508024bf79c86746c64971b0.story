Teenage twin sisters have been split up and forced to go to different schools after previously spending every day together.

Paris and Paige Carrington-Windo, 14, say they left secondary school, Miltoncross Academy in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for a new one when their family was due to move home.

However, when the house move fell through, only Paige was given her place back, while Paris must walk 30 minutes to go to Priory School, Portsmouth, a mile-and-a-half from where her sister studies.

The girls and their mother, Samantha Carrington-Windo, 35, have been left upset and frustrated by the school’s decision to only allow one of them back.

''I’m not happy at all. It’s really got the whole family down,' said Mrs Carrington-Windo, who lives with her daughters in Portsmouth.

'I’m a single parent and my two daughters have been together since birth. They are twins and they should go to the same school.

'I feel they should be leaving for school together and coming home together.

'It’s frustrating because every parent wants their child to do well and now Paris isn’t.

Changing plans: Paige (left) and Paris had left  Miltoncross Academy in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for a new one when their family was due to move, but when this fell through, only Paige was given her place back

Distance: While Paige is back at Miltoncross Academy, Paris is still at Priory School, a mile-and-a-half away

Lessons: Both girls had initially attended Miltoncross Academy, but now only Paige is a pupil

New school: Paris now goes to Priory School, which her mother says takes half an hour to reach

'It takes her half an hour just to get to school - I bought her a bike to help but someone damaged it.'

Miltoncross headteacher Fiona Calderbank said Mrs Carrington-Windo had hoped to move both her daughters following a disagreement over the school’s policies.

She said: 'Mrs Carrington-Windo informed us she was moving her children to another school.

'She was not happy with many of the school rules and policies when they were applied to her daughter Paris.

'As the school rules and policies have not changed and Paris is progressing well in her new school, it would not make educational sense for her to move again.

'Disagreement': Miltoncross headteacher said the girls' mother had disagreed with her over school policies regarding Paris (right), and it made 'educational sense' for the teenager to stay at her new school

'We had no cause or reason to contact mum regarding application of school rules and policies with respect of her other daughter.

'It would not have been fair not to accept her.'

Mrs Carrington-Windo maintained she had only wanted  the girls to change schools because of her planned house move, and that although she had complained to Miltoncross in the past over issues including Paris being told to wear leather shoes, this was not why she wanted the girls to leave.

She said if she had disagreed with the school, she would not have wanted both girls to return.

Mrs Carrington-Windo said: 'I didn’t like the school policies but that’s not why my daughter left the school. The house move fell through.'

Paris said: 'I can’t really concentrate in my lessons. I’m always with Paige and I don’t like being apart. I don’t want to be going to school.”

Paige added: 'It’s not the same any more because I am always with Paris. She was always there if I need help or anything.'
