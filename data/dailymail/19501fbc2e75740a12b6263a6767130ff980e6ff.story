One photographer decided to take his camera with him around the United States in attempt to capture people he finds quintessentially American.Leland Bobbe is a native New Yorker whose attempt to express 'Americana' is diversely displayed in his photographs of men, women, and children who represent America's spirit and cultural kitsch.

'These people are just people that I see in different places around the country that look interesting to me,' Bobbe told Huffington Post. 'From rural area summer fairs in upstate New York to the streets to New Orleans.'

The photos portray Americans who dawn their American spirit by wearing patriotic clothing or who posses a face that Bobbe finds, 'real' as explained in his artist statement.

'Obviously these images don’t represent every type of American. Personally I find these very “real” faces” more interesting than most doctors, lawyers and other white collar professionals. To my eye I believe it is their own personal style and character that sets them apart,' he explains.

More of the photographer's work can be found on his website and facebook page.
