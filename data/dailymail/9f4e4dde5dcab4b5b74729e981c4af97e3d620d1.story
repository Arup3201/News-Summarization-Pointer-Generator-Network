Smokey just might be living proof of that common myth: cats have nine lives.

But whether or not it's true - he's one damn lucky kitten.

So now the six-week-old is safe and sound, with possibly eight more lives to go, after being rescued by paramedics and firefighters at a burning house in Nowra.

He's alive! Bomaderry paramedic Kim Saunders cuddled Smokey the kitten following resuscitation with a baby oxygen mask

Emergency services crew worked hard to bring little Smokey back to life when his unconscious body was first discovered under a bed by a firefighter on Friday at after 11pm.

The grey fur-ball, who was covered in soot, had suffered from smoke inhalation and required CPR, which was promptly performed by the firefighter.

Little Smokey was then taken in by Bombaderry paramedic Kim Sauders who revived the cat inside the ambulance at the scene with a baby's oxygen mask.

'When we first saw Smokey he was covered in black sludge,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

'After 10-15minutes he started meowing again. I pulled off the mask and he pulled it straight back on, it was like he knew — he was enjoying it,' she said.

Smokey's owner Marianne Hense wasn't at home at the time but was relieved that her kitten was saved.

'Everything's going to be ok': Within 15 minutes in the ambulance the kitten was purring

'I don't care about anything inside the house, only that my cats were safe,' she said.

Fire crews arrived at the fibro house, on Kalandar Street, and found no other occupants were inside except for Smokey.

Ms Saunders, who's been a paramedic for 15 years, said it wasn't the first time she had rescued a pet.

It was only two weeks ago that she rescued a Labrador puppy which had been cornered by foxes.

In January, she also saved another dog who was running dangerously along the Princes Highway at South Nowra.

'My sister is a former veterinary nurse — she says I missed my calling,' Ms Saunders said.
