 An elderly driver landed in a swimming pool after mistaking the throttle on his powerful Audi A6 for the brake pedal.

The 84-year-old man crashed through a gate and plunged into his daughter's swimming pool after making the error in Wyckoff, New Jersey. 

The man and his 79-year-old female passenger had to be rescued from the semi-submerged car by relatives who dived into the pool.

The 84-year old man drove through the fence at the bottom of this driveway before plunging into the pool 

Wyckoff Police Chief Benjamin Fox told NJ.com both the man and passenger escaped without injury.

 He said: 'After driving to the end of the driveway it is believed that he then mistakenly stepped on the gas instead of the brake. 

'The 2006 Audi A-6 crashed through a fence and went into the pool in the rear yard.'

The car was later removed from the swimming pool by a tow truck.
