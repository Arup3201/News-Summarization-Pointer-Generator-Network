Scientists have created the clearest image yet of what the world’s earliest bird could have looked like.

Using complex new chemical tests, a team of experts at Manchester University revealed the 150 million-year-old animal’s incredible plumage.

The first complete chemical analysis of feathers from Archaeopteryx - a famous fossil that shows the incredible link between dinosaurs and birds - reveals its feathers are a completely different shade than previously thought. 

The new research has found they were patterned – light in colour, with a dark edge and tip to the feather – rather than all black, as ha been believed.

The first complete chemical analysis of feathers from Archaeopteryx, a famous fossil that shows the incredible link between dinosaurs and birds, has found its feathers were actually patterned and light in colour, with a dark edge and tip to the feather - rather than all black, as previously thought

The findings came from X-ray experiments by a team from The University of Manchester, working with colleagues at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

The scientists were able to find chemical traces of the original ‘dinobird’ and dilute traces of plumage pigments in the 150 million-year-old fossil.

'This is a big leap forward in our understanding of the evolution of plumage and also the preservation of feathers,' said Dr Phil Manning, a palaeontologist at The University of Manchester and lead author of the report in the June 13 issue of the Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry (Royal Society of Chemistry).

The new chemical tests have allowed scientists to peer into the past and given them an insight into what the ancient species would have looked like - a feat previously thought impossible.

Only 11 specimens of Archaeopteryx have been found, the first one consisting of a single feather.

Until a few years ago, researchers thought minerals would have replaced all the bones and tissues of the original animal during fossilisation, leaving no chemical traces behind, but two recently developed methods have turned up more information about the dinobird and its plumage.

The 150 million-year-old fossilised feather has shed new light on nature's earliest complex patterns

The first is the discovery of melanosomes – microscopic ‘biological paint pot’ structures in which pigment was once made, but are still visible in some rare fossil feathers.

A team led by researchers at Brown University announced last year that an analysis of melanosomes in the single Archaeopteryx feather indicated it was black.

They identified the feather as a covert – a type of feather that covers the primary and secondary wing feathers – and said its heavy pigmentation may have strengthened it against the wear and tear of flight, as it does in modern birds.

Over the past three years, the team used this method to discover chemical traces locked in the dinobird’s bones, feathers and in the surrounding rock, as well as pigments from the fossilised feathers of two specimens of another species of early bird.

This allowed the team to recreate the plumage pattern of an extinct bird for the very first time.

In the latest study, the team scanned the entire fossil of the first Archaeopteryx feather with the SSRL X-ray beam.

They found trace-metals that have been shown to be associated with pigment and organic sulphur compounds that could only have come from the animal’s original feathers.

'The fact that these compounds have been preserved in-place for 150 million years is extraordinary,' said Dr Manning.

'Together, these chemical traces show that the feather was light in colour with areas of darker pigment along one edge and on the tip.

Scans of a second fossilised Archaeopteryx, known as the Berlin counterpart, also show that the trace-metal inventory supported the same plumage pigmentation pattern.'

Co-author Dr Roy Wogelius, also based in Manchester’s School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, said: 'This work refines our understanding of pigment patterning in perhaps the most important known fossil. Our technique shows that complex patterns were present even at the very earliest steps in the evolution of birds.'

Dr Manning added: 'It is remarkable that x-rays brighter than a million suns can shed new light on our understanding of the processes that have locked elements in place for such vast periods of time.

Ultimately, this research might help inform scientists on the mechanisms acting during long-term burial, from animal remains to hazardous waste.

The fossil record has potential to provide the experimental hindsight required in such studies.'

The paper, ‘Synchrotron-based chemical imaging reveals plumage patterns in a 150million year old bird,’ was published in the June 13 issue of Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry,
