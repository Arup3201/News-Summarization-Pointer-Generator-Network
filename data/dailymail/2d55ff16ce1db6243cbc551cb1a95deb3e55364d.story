Alan Pardew becomes new Crystal Palace boss as Newcastle United thrash out £2million compensation deal with Eagles

In a bid to outwit the camera crews and photographers jostling at the main entrance to Newcastle United’s first-team base, a man in a purple LA Dodgers cap and black leather jacket slipped across half a mile of training pitches and left via the club’s academy for one final time.

That walk, with only the North Tyneside greenery for company, would have been his most peaceful 10 minutes of an otherwise frenzied and exhausting 48 hours.

For Alan Pardew — successfully dodging the press in his Dodgers disguise — has been on the back page of every newspaper and the lead item of every sports bulletin since the shock news broke of his decision to quit Newcastle for Crystal Palace on Sunday night. He has since been in meetings negotiating his release and the separation, it is thought, is amicable.

On Tuesday, he said his goodbyes. After four years, it is the end. He will leave his Ponteland home for the last time on Wednesday in the direction of south east London, where a £2million salary and a £1m bonus for Premier League survival awaits.

But for Newcastle, it is another beginning. On Tuesday, caretaker boss John Carver addressed United’s senior players. The mood is good, they are saddened but accepting of Pardew’s choice.

One point of relief and levity were the reports — strongly denied by the club — that skipper Fabricio Coloccini was set to be appointed manager. His team-mates are already calling him ‘gaffer’.

Such is the nature of a footballer’s existence, they move on. Pardew is gone. Talk on Tyneside and in the dressing-room has turned to his replacement.

Carver and coach Steve Stone — unaware of Pardew’s defection until Monday — will get the chance to impress over the next two matches, a home game with Burnley and the FA Cup tie at Leicester. Carver, a Geordie and disciple of Sir Bobby Robson, would love to manage his hometown club.

As would two other natives of the North-East, Steve Bruce and Lee Clark. Contact, meanwhile, has been made with Tony Pulis. He, however, was unhappy with some of the terms being floated.

And that, says former Newcastle favourite Steve Howey, is why Pardew’s successor must enter the role having already ceded some control to a hierarchy who identify signings.

‘It’s no good going into the job if you think you’re going to get the opportunity to do your own thing,’ he told Sportsmail.

All was quiet at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training on Tuesday, with no Pardew announcement imminent

‘That’s why I think Alan did a very good job. He made it work. Some fans think he was just a puppet for Mike Ashley. But how many of us would go storming into our boss’s office shouting the odds if we weren’t happy about something?

‘He was good at playing that role and was a politician at times. He was there for four years but I think he’d had enough – enough of some of the conditions he worked under and enough of some of the abuse from fans. I thought it was a disgrace when it affected his family.

‘So part of me thinks, “You know what, Alan, good on you”. Some people think things are going to suddenly change at the club because he’s gone and I understand some of the reasons why a lot of fans didn’t like him. But, for me, he did a good job and that might be realised in time.’

And Howey is right. Pardew leaving does not herald a brilliant new dawn at St James’ Park. Yes, there is the chance for a new man to inject new ideas, but he will still be Ashley’s man, a point which some supporters always held against Pardew.

The owner, says Howey, will reveal a lot about his aspirations for the club with this appointment.

‘It will be interesting to see who he gets,’ said the former England defender. ‘It will either show great ambition to go out and pay money for a high-profile name, or it could be an appointment which doesn’t excite the fans or capture the imagination.

‘Looking at the list of names linked so far there is no-one really who stands out who’d you’d say, “Yes, get him”.’

Perhaps that is why Newcastle will take their time. Any unveiling is not expected until next week at the earliest but work is underway to draw up a shortlist, hence the early contact with Pulis’s people.

Howey, though, is championing two of his former team-mates, Peter Beardsley and Les Ferdinand.

‘I don’t think it’s a bad idea at all to promote Peter from the Under-21s and give him until the end of the season,’ he said.

‘If it was from the outside then I’d say Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand as his assistant would appeal to fans.

Pardew played more than 100 games for Palace during a four-year spell at the south London club

‘Sherwood was pretty outspoken at Spurs but he might have learnt his lesson – he’d have to if he was going to work here. But he’s got an ace card in Les and that could work.’

Making things work is what it’s all about as manager of Newcastle. Pardew did. But, after four years, he’d had enough.

Now it’s the turn of someone else to play Magpie mediator – they best bring a cap and leather jacket just in case it doesn’t work out.
