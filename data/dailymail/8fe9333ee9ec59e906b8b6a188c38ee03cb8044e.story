Louise Huart with her son Keegan-James. She believes she was close to losing him during the complicated birth

A young mother claims hospital staff were at fault for her son almost dying - with one nurse even asking 'is he dead yet?'

Louise Huart says her and her baby boy, Keegan-James, 'are lucky to be here' after they both survived a battle for life through the birth process.

Her newborn son had suffered severe blood and fluid loss and contracted suspected sepsis during the delivery.

The 22-year-old from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, claims midwives at Scarborough General Hospital, where Keegan-James was delivered, should have realised he was in a life-threatening condition and ordered an emergency caesarean earlier.

After being transferred to Hull Women and Children’s Hospital after the birth, she said nurses told her that a member of staff from Scarborough had called to see if her baby 'was dead yet'.

The allegation was refuted by a hospital spokesperson, who said there was 'no evidence' the 'wholly unacceptable' comment was made by its staff.

She said: 'What happened to us was absolutely appalling. We are both so lucky to be here.'

Ms Huart was rushed to the hospital in Scarborough on May 13 by her partner, Leo Parker, 23, as her contractions fell to just two minutes apart and she received gas and air, pethidine and an epidural.

When her waters broke at 3.30am, they were thick with meconium, a sign that Keegan-James could be in distress.

Despite a monitor showing her son’s heart rate was dipping, she claims a doctor who attended to her said the baby was fine.

She had to have her epidural topped up twice, but by 7.30am her contractions had stopped completely.

'I thought he had just given up - it was heart-breaking.'

Finally, after being encouraged to deliver her child naturally for two hours without contractions, she headed for a caesarean section at 10.30am.

After she received another spinal injection, she had an asthma attack and fell unconscious.

'I’ve had asthma since I was a child but I don’t use inhalers and I don’t even go to reviews.'

She met her son for the first time after 39 hours after they were both transferred to Hull Women and Children’s Hospital.

She said: 'For the nine days we were there, staff in Hull were fantastic.

'On the day we were discharged, one of the nurses told me someone from Scarborough had called to see if Keegan-James was "dead yet".

'Obviously, they hadn’t expected him to survive.'

Ms Huart has now contacted a lawyer and written a letter of complaint to Scarborough General Hospital

A 
spokesperson for York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which runs
 Scarborough Hospital, denied a staff member had made the comment.

'This
 type of comment is wholly unacceptable for any healthcare provider. We 
keep clear records of contact with all neonatal units outside our area 
and there is no evidence of such a comment.'

Louise has just learned how close she came to losing her son after she was called to Scarborough Hospital to go through her delivery notes.

Keegan-James was born with meconium aspiration syndrome, when a baby breathes in a mixture of amniotic fluid and meconium, and hypovolemic shock, which is severe blood and fluid loss meaning the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body.

He also had suspected sepsis, which is an infection of the blood, pulmonary hypertension of the new-born and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, when the brain is deprived of oxygen.

Louise has contacted a solicitor and is now writing a letter of complaint to Scarborough Hospital.

Liz Ross, head of midwifery at York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, added: 'We were sorry to hear Ms Huart had concerns regarding the care provided at Scarborough Hospital during the birth of her son.

'A meeting has taken place with Ms Huart to go through the events of the birth and we are disappointed to hear she was unhappy with the outcome of this meeting.

'We are committed to being open and honest with our patients. We offered Ms Huart the opportunity to come back and speak to us at any time.

'We would encourage her to do this so we can continue to work with her to address the issues she has raised here.'
