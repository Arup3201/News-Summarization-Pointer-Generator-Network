A bride's letter uninviting her parents to her wedding has gone viral after she shared it on a social networking site.

Alyssa Pearce, 23, from Adelaide, Australia, posted the anti-invite on the site ahead of her wedding to her husband Alex, 28, last year and it has since been shared thousands of times.

In her original post Alyssa said a family fall-out drove her to run away from home at the age of 16.

This 'un-invite' has gone viral in the run up to wedding season, it was posted to a social networking site by a woman who said she was fed up with her  parents

The PhD student, studying Applied Linguistics, said that despite the family's history her parents were pushing for an invitation to her wedding. 

She wrote: 'There was really only one way to respond.' 

Alyssa then uploaded a picture of her wedding un-invitation printed on mottled paper in black type.

It reads: 'Together with our friends and family, Alex and Alyssa, would like to invite you to suck it and bask in our happiness, your bitterness and our mutual irritation at each other's existence... As we completely ignore yours and celebrate our marriage without you. 

'There will be a lovely ceremony, followed by cake, food and general merriment. 

'And you're not invited to any of it. Because f*** you that's why.'

In further comments, the bride - who married Alex, a student studying World Politics and International Relations, and French last year - went on to reveal that she hadn't  had any contact with her parents in seven years.

She says she ran away from home after, what she claims, was a difficult relationship with her  father.

On the site, she wrote: 'It's the first time I've contacted them of my own accord. My grandparents keep pushing me to meet up with them and play happy families.

'It's been seven years since I ran away and I've reluctantly met up with them maybe half a dozen times.'

Alyssa outlined how her parents communicate with her only through her grandparents but she said getting married made her realise it was time to take a stand.

Speaking exclusively to FEMAIL, Alyssa said that after months of discussion as to whether she'd invite her estranged parents, she 'snapped'.

'I went home and wrote my parents the de-invitation. I opened up a word document, found the nicest calligraphy font I could, loaded up the printer with some of the lovely parchment paper left over from the other invitations, and wrote,' she said.

'I then found a nice matching envelope, addressed it with a fancy gold pen, and posted it. I mean, if you’re going to send someone a memorable "stuff you", you may as well go all-out.

'Writing and sending that letter made me feel so much better about all the stress I’d been under. Not only had I refused to allow myself to be bullied into something I didn’t want, but I also took a stand. 

'While it may have been childish and immature, it made me feel as if I’d taken back power from them.' 

She also revealed most members of her family and Alex's family supported her decision.

Many other users on the social networking site rushed to send their messages of support. One  said: 'Oh you are a complete bada** well done.'

Another said: 'I love you. I love the anti-invite. I love your bada**ery. Congratulations! Hole your wedding is beautiful! [sic]'

And one user added: 'I love you. That's incredible. You go.'

Alyssa looked happy on her big day, despite the family fall out she said her wedding was great 

After her original post the Alyssa posted an update not long after. In it she explained how her grandparents had contacted her over worries about the family feud and who would walk her down the aisle.

In the post she details how her grandparents contacted her asking her to come to their house to see them. She says she was braced for an argument but when she got their her grandfather handed her his phone which contained a message from her father that had been sent to him with her parents blaming them for her actions.

She said: 'It went something like, 'Our relationship is now irreconcilable'. If you keep harassing my family I will take out a court order to protect them. I don't want to see you again near my business/house/family. I love how I'm not included in that 'his family'. Oh well.'

Alyssa goes on to detail how she and her grandparents poured their hearts out to one another over the situation. She revealed that her grandfather, who she refers to as 'pops,' felt he could no longer walk her down the aisle.

She said: 'He looked a little bit sad and surprised when I said I hadn't expected him to walk me down the aisle anyway. I knew some drama with my parents would prevent it, but I could dream.'

Alyssa also revealed that her parents hadn't mentioned anything about the letter and she thought they were still expecting an invite to the wedding. She went on to say that she felt her relationship had gone downhill with her father when she wasn't born a boy.

Following their wedding Alyssa and Alex traveled to Thailand where they enjoyed their sunny honeymoon together

After the original post was made the Alyssa sent an update saying that her parents had sent a scathing message to her grandparents saying, 'Our relationship is now irreconcilable.'

She also revealed how her grandparents, including her grandfather who was going to walk her down the aisle, were afraid to come to the wedding. 

When users questions what she would do she said in a comment: 'The aisle is only wide enough for one awesome person, so I'll be walking myself down :P'.  

And indeed in a new message posted just yesterday the bride revealed that she did not let the absence of her grandparents, nor her parents, ruin her big day.

She wrote: 'Realising that you're not alone is the best feeling ever :) And the wedding was amazing!'

She reveals that the wedding took place in a 'public garden,' and that they refused to give into family pressure to invite her parents. 

Following their wedding the couple honeymooned in Thailand where they enjoyed boat trips and went to see elephants. 

Alyssa originally posted the picture five months ago but it has been picked up in the run up to wedding season.

Speaking of her surprise that the invitation had gone viral she said: 'I was astounded. I saw that a radio station or two had dug it out of the woodwork a few days ago but I did not think that it would get to be this big. 

'Especially since it's been nearly 6 months since the photo was uploaded. I didn't even think much of it when I wrote the de-invitation, I showed it to family and friends who applauded and asked me to post it on an online forum.'

She added: 'The messages of empathy and support have simply been overwhelming -  Alex and I have been reading comments and we both appreciate all of the support.'
