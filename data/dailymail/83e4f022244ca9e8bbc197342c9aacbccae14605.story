Celtic will remain in the Champions League after Legia Warsaw lost their appeal to have their ban overturned on Thursday.

The Polish side had hoped UEFA's appeals body would reinstate them after they were demoted to the Europa League for fielding an ineligible player during the second leg of their Champions League qualifying game against the Scottish champions.

But Legia co-owner Dariusz Mioduski has confirmed that the club will now take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, tweeting: 'Unfortunately for now football is not winning… We are going to CAS.'

Legia president Boguslaw Lesnodorski echoed Mioduski's pledge to take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

He wrote on Twitter: 'Negative decision, it's hard even to comment, we are using the CAS (we plan to tomorrow) and otherwise we are focused only on the games.'

Legia believed Bartosz Bereszynski suspension had been served after he missed both legs of the previous qualifier against St Patrick's Athletic as well as the first leg against Celtic, but their failure to register him for the game against St Patrick's proved costly.

Mioduski released a statement through the club's official website which stressed Legia's determination to keep fighting for Champions League reinstatement.

The statement read: 'Till the last moment we hoped that the spirit of sport wins, we find the decision extremely unfair. However we expected that decision and were prepared for it. We are to appeal to the CAS promptly.

'We will use the full appeal procedure, in order to get back our result that was fairly gained on the pitch. We will certainly fully subordinate to the final verdict. But I still hope that football will win, as well as the values it is based on: fair-play and respect to the on-the-pitch result.'

Lesnodorski added: 'We hope that CAS will judge our case as soon as possible.We don't give up and keep fighting. Our lawyers are now working hard on the case, while the team prepares for the forthcoming matches. We aim high as always.'

Celtic will now face Slovenian side Maribor in the play-off round, leaving Legia to take on Aktobe of Kazakhstan in the Europa League play-off.

The verdict was confirmed in a UEFA statement which read: 'The UEFA Appeals Body met (on Wednesday) following an appeal by Legia Warsaw against the decision taken by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on 8 August.

'The appeal lodged by the Polish club was rejected and, therefore, the original decision of the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body is confirmed.

'The Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body had sanctioned Legia for fielding a suspended player (Article 18 of the Regulations of the UEFA Champions League, 2014/15 competition, and Article 21 of the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations, 2014 edition) in the 2014/15 UEFA Champions League third qualifying round return leg against Celtic FC in Edinburgh on 6 August. That match has been declared as a forfeit, meaning Legia lost 3-0.'
