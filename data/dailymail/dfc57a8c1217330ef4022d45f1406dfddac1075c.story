James Bulger's killer will seek to be released from prison later this month, it has emerged.

But the victim's father Ralph says that Jon Venables must not be given parole, insisting he still poses a danger to children.

Mr Bulger has apparently even suggested that the killer should never be let out of jail in the light of his horrifying crimes.

Venables and Robert Thompson were 10 years old when they abducted two-year-old James from a Merseyside shopping centre before torturing and killing him in 1993.

The pair were released on licence in 2001, but three years ago Venables was found to have downloaded child pornography and was sent back to prison.

He applied for parole in 2011, but was turned down, and is now eligible to apply again.

Venables will appear in front of a judge at Liverpool Crown Court via video link later this month, according to The Sun.

Ralph Bulger and his brother Jimmy have written an impact statement urging the court to reject the killer's parole application.

Mr Bulger, 46, has told friends: 'Venables is a murdering and violent sexual predator, from a boy to a man, and nothing has changed.'

He added: 'He deserves to spend the rest of his days behind bars,' according to The Sun.

James's two killers are both living under assumed identities owing to the risk of vigilante attacks.

Venables has had to be given a number of new identities after repeatedly blowing his cover, but Thompson has kept out of legal trouble.
