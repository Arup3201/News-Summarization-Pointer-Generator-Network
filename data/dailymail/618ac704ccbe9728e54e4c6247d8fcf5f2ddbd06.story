At least two civilian workers were killed after missiles launched in a US airstrike targeting an ISIS-controlled region in Syria struck grain silos, according to a human rights group.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights believes aircraft may have mistaken the mills and grain storage areas in the northern Syrian town of Manbij for an Islamic State base.

The US-led coalition has been targeting towns and villages in northern and eastern Syria controlled by the Islamic State group since last week.

The campaign expands upon US airstrikes against militants in Iraq since early August.

The Observatory, which gathers information from sources in Syria, says a grain silo was set ablaze by a missile from one of the most recent airstrikes - killing at least two civilians.

Strikes on a building on a road leading out of the town also killed a number of Islamic State fighters, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Observatory which gathers information from sources in Syria. 

Mr Abdulrahman, said today: 'These were the workers at the silos. They provide food for the people.' The airstrikes 'destroyed the food that was stored there'.

The Observatory says that at least 19 civilians have been killed so far in coalition airstrikes

The group says at least 19 civilians have been killed so far in coalition airstrikes.

The US military said tonight that an American air strike overnight had targeted Islamic State vehicles in a staging area adjacent to a grain storage facility near Manbij, and added it had no evidence so far of civilian casualties.

'We are aware of media reports alleging civilian casualties, but have no evidence to corroborate these claims,' said Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman at the US military's Central Command. He promised that the military would look into the report further, saying it took such matters seriously.

The United States has been bombing Islamic State and other groups in Syria for a week with the help of Arab allies, and hitting targets in neighbouring Iraq since last month. European countries have joined the campaign in Iraq but not in Syria.

Manbij sits between Aleppo city in the west and the town of Kobani on the northern border with Turkey, which Islamic State has been trying to capture from Kurdish forces, forcing tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds to flee over the frontier

The US said the facility targeted was used by the Islamic State as a logistics hub and vehicle staging area.

On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said that it had confirmed the deaths of at least seven civilians - two women and five children - from apparent U.S. missile strikes on September 23 in the village of Kafr Derian in Idlib province. 

The New York-based group said two men were also killed in the strikes, but that they may have been militants, basing its conclusions on conversations with three local residents.

'The US and its allies in Syria should be taking all feasible precautions to avoid harming civilians,' said Nadim Houry, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.

Syria's army also carried out air raids in Aleppo province overnight, targeting areas east of Aleppo city with barrel bombs and other projectiles, the Observatory said

'The U.S. government should investigate possible unlawful strikes that killed civilians, publicly report on them, and commit to appropriate redress measures in case of wrongdoing.'

Forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have been battling Islamist fighters around Aleppo, which is held by a number of groups in Syria's war.

In eastern Syria, US-led forces bombed a gas plant controlled by the Islamic State outside Deir al-Zor city, wounding several of the militant group's fighters, the Observatory said.

The US has said it wants strikes to target oil facilities held by Islamic State to try to stem a source of revenues for the group. 

The raid hit Kuniko gas plant, which feeds a power station in Homs that provides several provinces with electricity and powers oil field generators, the Observatory said.
