They have been billed as this year’s Olympic Games, the sporting event that will send a positive message about life beyond disability for servicemen and women wounded on the front line.

But while the world awaits the lavish opening ceremony of the first Invictus Games on Wednesday, organiser Prince Harry has spoken for the first time about how difficult it has been to put on the Paralympics-style event. 

In an hour-long documentary tomorrow night, he reveals that staging the Games had been much harder than he had anticipated.

‘It’s been a real wake-up call for me,’ the Prince said. ‘Me and my big mouth, saying we’re going to fill the Olympic Stadium, we’re going to do this, do that.

‘In my head it seemed very, very easy. In reality it’s been a real struggle.’

The Games will see more than 400 wounded, injured and sick servicemen and women compete across several sporting disciplines, including wheelchair rugby and athletics. 

Thirteen nations, including Afghanistan, will compete at the tournament, which takes place at some of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games venues.

At the opening ceremony, Coldplay’s Chris Martin will perform the official Games anthem and there will be a flypast by the Red Arrows. 

The star-studded closing ceremony on September 14 will see performances from acts including Foo Fighters, James Blunt and the Military Wives Choir. 

Thousands of £12.85 tickets have been sold and some events are sold out. But the 29-year-old Prince remains nervous.

Prince Harry said: ‘In my head it seemed very, very easy. In reality it’s been a real struggle' 

‘Oh, of course I’m nervous,’ he said. ‘There are times when we thought that we’re just never, ever going to get to the finish line. If all the venues sell out, then I’m happy because it’s all about the atmosphere and making these guys feel really special. 

'All they want to do is make sure they’re fit enough and ready to put on a show for the public who have been constantly giving money to Help for Heroes and the other Service Charities. People are coming because they want to show their appreciation,’ Harry said.

The Prince admitted the idea was ‘stolen’ from America’s Warrior Games, a similar event for injured US soldiers, now in its fourth year. However, he first considered the idea after his first tour of Afghanistan in 2008. 

He recalled: ‘I came back on a plane with three wounded guys all in induced comas. I think a Danish soldier died, so his coffin was underneath us. That for me was where it all started,’ he said.

The name ‘Invictus’ – Latin for ‘unconquered’ – was inspired by William Ernest Henley’s classic poem of the same name, which tells of strength during times of adversity.

Iraq has turned down the offer to compete at the  event due partly to the ongoing conflict in the ravaged country.

There
 is speculation that  the war-torn country has decided not to send a 
team  for fear that its athletes  will be a target for those angered by 
the atrocities carried out in the region by Islamic State militants.

But
 Jackie Brock-Doyle, a spokesman for the Invictus Games, insists this 
was not  the case. She said: ‘It has  just not been possible for  Iraq 
to put together a team of competitors in the time available and with the
 other pressures currently on the military in Iraq.’

Countries had five months  to prepare teams after organisation for the Games began in February.

Ms
 Brock-Doyle added: ‘Help For Heroes has been behind putting the British
 team together and has been so supportive. Not every country invited to 
compete at Invictus may have an organisation like that to help out.’

Iraq
 will show support for the event by sending a small delegation of 
observers. Organisers hope the country will take part in future events.

My journey from battlefield to sports field: Army captain on how he's helping run the Invictus Games after being shot by the Taliban in 2009

David Wiseman, 31, served as a captain with The Yorkshire Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he commanded a team of British soldiers embedded with Afghan forces deep in central Helmand province’s Nad-e Ali district. In 2009 he was shot by the Taliban, suffering extensive chest wounds. He was medically discharged from the Army last year and is now helping to run the Invictus Games, as well as competing in them. 

It was the moment in which my life changed for ever. Without warning, the quiet of the morning was shattered by the sound of automatic fire opening up on my patrol in Helmand. I didn’t know how many of them there were, so I inched forward to get a better fix on the situation. The first round was so close I felt it whistle past my head; the second floored me.

I had no time to react. It smashed into my shoulder like a sledgehammer, pulverising bone and tissue. It travelled through my chest, snapping my ribs like matchsticks and lacerating a lung. I was picked up by the force and flung several metres through the air, spinning like a rag doll.

Survival instinct kicked in, and I slithered into the ditch by the side of the road for cover. In the fetid water I began to gasp for breath. Dust, air and ditch water sucked in through the angry hole in my shoulder as I tried to inhale. The pain was indescribable.

I knew my injuries were serious and that I needed to get to the hospital in Camp Bastion. ‘And yea though I walk through the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil.’ My medic Manny’s voice filled my ears. ‘Damn, I am in the s***,’ I thought. He’s reciting the Psalms.’

The sounds of battle were becoming distant. ‘This is it; this is how I end,’ I told myself. Instead, it was a beginning of sorts. After an operation at Camp Bastion, I was flown to Selly Oak Hospital. My battle back to health was slow.

In July 2013, dressed in my uniform for what would be one of the last times, I listened as doctors recommended that, on physical and psychological grounds, service in the Army was unsuitable for me. My time in the Army was over.

I was expecting the decision, however, it still felt like someone had punched me in the stomach. Over the preceding year there had been a fundamental shift in the way I viewed myself. I’d only ever been in the Army; it was what defined me. But, post injury, I could only think of myself as something I used to be: an ex-soldier, wounded soldier, broken.

Now I have been honoured to play a role in running and taking part in the inaugural Invictus Games. These are men and women who have served and fought together. They bonded on the battlefield: now they’ll bond on the sports field.

The bullet remains embedded deep in my chest, and I will carry it with me for life. It is part of who I am and a permanent reminder of the fragility of life and how things can change in an instant.

lHelmand To The Himalayas: One Soldier’s Inspirational Journey, by David Wiseman, is available now, priced at £8.99.
