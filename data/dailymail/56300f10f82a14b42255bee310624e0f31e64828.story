Devastating consequences of mistakes by NHS staff are exposed today.

An official report reveals how basic errors left a baby brain-damaged and a woman unable to have children, and in some cases resulted in needless deaths.

It highlights a snapshot of 126 cases investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman last year, warning that mistakes affect patients of all ages in hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries.

Blunders: A report highlights a snapshot of 126 cases investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman last year, warning mistakes affect patients of all ages in hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries

Dame Julie Mellor, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, said: ‘These investigations highlight the devastating impact failures in public services can have on the lives of individuals and their families. We are increasingly concerned about patients being discharged unsafely from hospital.

‘Unplanned admissions and re-admissions are a massive cost to the NHS.’

The report will renew fears that the NHS is struggling to provide safe care for the rising numbers of patients. 

Only last week senior NHS officials warned that the health service needed an extra £8billion a year to meet the demands of a growing and ageing population.

'Devastating': Dame Julie Mellor, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, whose role is to investigate complaints against the NHS

They said that unless more funding was provided – and services run more efficiently – patient safety could be jeopardised. 

Officials hope that exposing the failings will encourage NHS staff to learn from the mistakes.

Dame Julie said that last year her office investigated 424 cases of patients, mostly the elderly, being discharged too soon. Such patients often have to be re-admitted after developing infections or suffering falls because they have not fully recovered.

It also looked into 20 cases of cancer misdiagnosis whereby lifesaving treatment had been delayed because symptoms had been missed by doctors.

The ombudsman’s role is to investigate complaints against the NHS which have allegedly not been properly dealt with.

This is the first time the ombudsman has published such detailed information on NHS failings. Previous reports have been more general, with only a few cases highlighted.

It now plans to release similar reports on a regular basis to improve transparency.

A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘Where someone wants to raise a concern, it is important that they can do this easily and that it is quickly acted on.

‘This report lays out an important challenge to services to learn from complaints.’

A woman admitted to hospital for an operation to remove an ovary was mistakenly given a full hysterectomy.

The unnamed patient had her uterus and appendix unnecessarily removed by doctors at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust.

Following the surgery the woman's wound reopened but doctors failed to treat it properly.

The patient had to have a restorative operation and was forced to take long periods of time off work recovering from the ordeal.

She made a complaint to the trust and received £11,000 compensation. 

The case was investigated by the NHS watchdog, who concluded that doctors failed to carry out adequate assessments and that the woman's postoperative care fell below the required standards. 

Helen Morgan, deputy chief nurse for UH Bristol, said: 'We always strive to resolve complaints from patients and their families, as respond to their questions, as quickly as possible. 

'Unfortunately on these occasions our response did not satisfy these patients and their families.

'The trust has apologised and we do once again publicly.'  

It was one of three mistakes in the West Country that have been investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. 

In another Bristol case another woman, who subsequently died, was found to have been discharged while she was still unwell and was readmitted the following day.

The watchdog ruled the decision to discharge her was not based on complete information, but found it did not find the failings led to her death.

 The ombudsman also found Weston Area Health NHS Trust in Somerset failed to alert a patient to the potential risks of an operation on his wrist which left him with nerve damage.

A trust spokesman said: 'We take complaints very seriously and always learn from them, to make changes to do things differently so as to ultimately benefit our patients.'
