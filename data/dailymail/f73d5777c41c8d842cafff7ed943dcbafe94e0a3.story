Scientists have claimed that our best chance of finding alien life is not looking for living animal organisms but rather plant life.

Two astrophysicists have said we should be looking at exoplanets for signatures of chlorophyll, which plants use to convert sunlight into energy.

And they say this could be done by a future telescope planned by Nasa to study habitable exoplanets.

Princeton University scientists have suggested looking for chlorophyll on exoplanets. They say if found this would be a strong indicator a planet has vegetation. This in turn would suggest it has plant life - and maybe animals as well. This could be performed by a future Nasa telescope called Atlast

Princeton University astrophysicists Dr Timothy Brandt and Dr David Spiegel made the suggestions in a paper called 'Prospects for detecting oxygen, water and chlorophyll on an exo-Earth.'

They say that it might be possible to detect signatures of water, oxygen and chlorophyll on an alien planet.

One hundred million worlds in our galaxy are able to host alien life, according to a 'conservative' prediction by Nasa.

And the space agency claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years, with a high chance it will be outside our solar system.

During a public talk in July in Washington, the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes.

'Do we believe there is life beyond Earth?' said former astronaut and Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden during a talk earlier this month in Washington.

'I would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone.' 

The latter would be the most difficult of the three but, if found, would be a pretty clear indicator that a distant world has plant life. 

To find it they propose that a future telescope could have a capability to detect the unique reflection of light from chlorophyll.

However they write: 'Photosynthetic extraterrestrial life may use a different family of pigment molecules than their terrestrial [counterparts], and the understanding that any claimed detection would be extremely controversial.'

They add that while detecting chlorophyll would be an indicator - if not definitive proof of life - we should also first look for oxygen and water.

'Water is a very common molecule, and I think a mission to take spectra of exoplanets should certainly look for water,' said Dr Brandt, the lead study author, reports Space.com

'Indeed, we have found water in a few gas giants more massive than Jupiter orbiting other stars.'

Once these have been found, however, they say that chlorophyll should be searched for on the most promisingly habitable world.

In addition it would only be detectable when an exoplanet had a lot of vegetation and cloud cover.

One telescope that could be used to do this would be Nasa's proposed Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (Atlast).

'The goal of a future space telescope will be primarily to detect water and oxygen on a planet around a nearby star,' Dr Brandt said. 

'The construction and launch of such a telescope will probably cost at least $10 billion [£6.2 billion] and won't happen for at least 20 years - a lot of technology development needs to happen first - but it could be the most exciting mission of my lifetime.'

Last week astronomers detected water vapour in the atmosphere of a planet 124 light years from Earth. The planet, HAT-P-11 b (illustrated), is about the size of Neptune and is the smallest outside the solar system known to contain H2O molecules

Nasa is now investigating the viability of this conceptual mission, called the Advanced Telescope Large-Aperture Space Telescope (Atlast), which looks quite similar to 2018's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)

But the next step should be chlorophyll to confirm a planet's habitability
