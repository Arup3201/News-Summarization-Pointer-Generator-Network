Arrested: Conman Peter Foster who helped Cherie Blair buy two flats

Peter Foster, the conman who was at the centre of the Cheriegate saga, was back behind bars last night after a chase through a hospital’s corridors.

He was arrested over alleged false claims about a weight loss treatment.

Australian police moved in on Foster as he sat at the bedside of his 80-year-old mother, Louise, who had collapsed with an apparent stroke shortly after announcing that she was suing News International for allegedly hacking into her phone in 2002.

Foster, 49, jumped up from his bedside chair and was chased through the corridors of the Pindara Private Hospital in Benowa on Queensland’s Gold Coast.

His mother yelled at officers to leave him alone, saying he had done nothing wrong.

Police have arrested Foster amid claims he was involved in ‘misleading and deceptive conduct’ and made ‘false claims’ about a weight loss spray.

Following previous fraud convictions, he was prevented from being involved in any companies in Australia.

Controversial: The Sensaslim diet spray

But it is alleged that he failed to disclose that he was behind the Sensaslim ‘spray on, lose weight’ business.

He is to appear in court in Queensland next week.

Controversy has followed Foster for much of his adult life.

He persuaded model Samantha Fox to 
help promote a tea that he said helped drinkers lose weight, although 
the claims were later disputed.

He then promoted other slimming 
products, resulting in imprisonment in Britain and the U.S. for 
deceptive advertising.

But it was his affair with Cherie Blair’s lifestyle adviser, Carole Caplin, that resulted in the Cheriegate saga.

After learning from her in 2002 that Mrs
Blair was hoping to buy two flats in Bristol, he talked his way into 
buying them for the then Prime Minister’s wife at a discounted price.

his relationship with the PM's wife

At the time, Mrs Blair denied that Foster had had any involvement in the deal and that they had communicated.

But the Daily Mail published devastating evidence of emails between Mrs Blair and Foster in which she described him as ‘a star’ and told him: ‘We are on the same wave length, Peter.’

In an attempt to end the saga, Mrs Blair made a tearful defence of her relationship with Miss Caplin and claimed she did not know about Foster’s criminal past.

Peter Foster's involvement with Cherie Blair came to light when it was 
revealed that he was her financial adviser over the purchase of two 
flats in Bristol.

The
Prime Minister's wife tried to distance herself from him and released a
public statement claiming he was not involved with the property deal.

But
the Daily Mail newspaper provided devastating email evidence between 
her and Foster in which she described him as 'a star' and said, 'We are 
on the same wave length, Peter.'

She
went public herself, tearfully reading a prepared statement blaming her
'misfortune' on the pressures of running a family and being a mother.

Cherie
and Tony Blair at one time agreed to be godparents to the yet-to-be 
born child of Foster and his partner - Cherie's lifestyle adviser Carole
Caplin - who later miscarried.
