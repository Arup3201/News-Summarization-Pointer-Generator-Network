For several days in October 2012, parts of New York City life to a halt – but throughout it all, new life was being born.

In one of the most memorable scenes from Superstorm Sandy, nurses were seen whisking newborns down several flights of stairs to safety after one of New York's biggest hospitals lost power.

More than 300 patients were evacuated from NYU’s Langone Medical Center, including 20 babies from the neonatal and pediatric intensive care units as well as 22 newborns.

Overnight, some nurses even had to carry new mothers down stairs using sleds.

Some staff used hand-pumps to fill little ones lungs full of oxygen.

Three women gave birth in the dark to the light of a glow stick.

Today, those babies are one and starting to walk and talk.

Emma Martinez weighed less than two pounds when she came into the world. Now she is taking her first steps on her own.

A
year ago, Emma was just three weeks old and had been on a ventilator in
Langone’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit when Sandy struck.

Nurses had to hand-pump oxygen into her lungs while she was evacuated uptown to Mount Sinai Hospital.

Her
parents found her in a quiet corner at Mount Sinai, which was bustling 
with evacuees. ‘She was just laying there in the incubator like nothing 
was happening,’ said Luz to NBC News. ‘I saw her, and she gave me so 
much peace of mind.’

Now we are 1: Six families with their babies from Superstorm Sandy pose for a group portrait

Tamar 
Weinstock kept calm after the power was lost at the hospital. She joked 
with her husband and mother-in-law about the glow sticks being handed 
out as emergency light sources and marveled at the nurse calculating her
contractions with pen, paper and a watch.

Weinstock
wasn’t sure if she would deliver at NYU or be evacuated first, but then
she heard the staff in the hallway talking and someone said, ‘Alright, 
let’s deliver this baby!’

Her
son Stone emerged at 10:39 p.m. in the dark on Oct. 29. Within an hour,
Weinstock was strapped to a sled and shuttled downstairs to an 
ambulance that took her family, with its newest member, to Mount Sinai.

‘It
was an adventure the way he came into the world,’ Weinstock said. ‘I 
just think that’s probably a sign of a lot of adventure to come in our 
lives where Stone is involved.’

Heros: Four newborns were on respirators that were breathing for them, and when the power went out, each baby was carried down nine flights of stairs while a nurse manually squeezed a bag to deliver air to the baby's lungs

A night to remember: Some 1,000 staff members -- doctors, nurses, residents and medical students -- along with firefighters and police officers evacuated the patients. Much of the work was done by flashlight

Julia Alemany was in labor when the hospital lost power. Doctors gave her an epidural using the light from a cellphone.

by the light of a cellphone, and then she was evacuated -- still having contractions -- down eight flights of stairs on a sled.

‘Very slowly they belayed her down like a rock climber,’ said her husband, Doron Markus to NBC News.

She delivered Micah the next day.

‘It
was a collective effort of a lot of people involved,’ said Alemany.  
‘He’s a handful,’ she said. ‘We believe that because he was born in such
extreme circumstances, he is a very active baby.’

Alice Rosenbaum  arrived a day before Sandy hit New York.

Her
parents could see the swirling floodwaters from their hospital room but
nevertheless chose to stay put at Langone instead of being evacuated.

The following morning she was taken on a media tour as her parents conducted interviews with the national press.

Freda was born on the day Sandy pummelled the city. Now one, she is already walking.

Her mom Julz Donald and husband Mark Potts think her strong personality comes from Freda’s birth.

‘I
think that some of the storm definitely rubbed off on her,’ said 
Donald. ‘She has definitely got a feisty kind of positive determination 
about her.’

The family was resting in their 13th floor hospital room as the storm began to ramp up.

When the lights went out, staff gave them a flashlight, and they hunkered down until they evacuated the building before dawn.

That flashlight is tucked in Freda’s birth box – ready for a  future bedtime story for a little girl born on a big day.

NYU Langone: With its combination of clinical, research and academic facilities, may have been the New York City hospital that was most devastated by Hurricane Sandy. The East River filled the basement

William Donovan was born with a serious heart defect and had only just come off a ventilator in Langone’s Congenital Cardiovascular Care Unit two days before Sandy hit.

His dad, Jeremy, rushed to the hospital to check on his three-week-old son. The hospital were evacuating the 15th floor as he arrived.

 ‘He slept through the entire endeavor. He has had more stressful nights at the supermarket than he did in the hurricane,’ Jeremy said.  ‘He was pretty laidback during the whole thing.’

Daria Shurba and her husband Dmitry welcomed their baby Maria into the world early on October 29. Daria had been praying that her ‘little munchkin’ would arrive before Sandy.

‘Luckily, my daughter was smart enough to decide to come out right before the hurricane,’ she said.

After the blackout, they felt the building shake and the windows rumbles as Sandy passed over.

 The Shurbas were eventually evacuated uptown to Lenox Hill Hospital.

 As they left there a day later, they looked to see if they could add Sandra as a middle name to the birth certificate that they’d already filed.

‘This is something that she should be proud of,’ Daria said. ‘That she is one of those hurricane babies and she did great.’
