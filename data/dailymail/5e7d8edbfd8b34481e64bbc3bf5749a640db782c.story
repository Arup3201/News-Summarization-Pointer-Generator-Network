Honestly. You spend hours being bathed, blow-dried and brushed to perfection.

Then it starts pouring with rain – and someone shoves a tiger print onesie over your head.

Still, the indignity of their wet weather gear was worth it for these pedigree pooches.

Because they were on their way to the first day of Crufts, where not a hair can be out of place.

As well as the rather garish onesies, 
some pampered pets had specially designed canine wellies in which to pad
– or rather paddle – their way to the National Exhibition Centre in 
Birmingham.

The smaller 
breeds were wheeled in on trolleys with makeshift tarpaulins thrown over
their boxes, but for Louis the Afghan hound, one of the biggest dogs, 
the solution was even more undignified.

His
owner, Dominico Traversi, simply hoisted him on to his shoulders and 
dashed through the 7am downpour, sparing his paws from trailing through 
puddles.

Once inside, it was
off with the onesies and out with the combs as owners battled to get 
their pets’ coats back into immaculate condition before the frizz set 
in.

The Kennel Club estimates 145,000 people will visit the four-day show, which features around 27,000 dogs.

Weary dogs and their tired out owners were pictured taking a well earned break after an intensive day of grooming and competing at Crufts.

Thousands of pampered pets descended on Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre today for the start of the annual show - with many donning the latest in canine wet-weather fashion to brave the rain.

But after hours of intensive competition many of the dogs, and their human companions, were ready for a snooze.

Man's best friend: An owner sleeps next to his Beagle in one of the competitors stalls. Both owners and dogs have had a very long day, with many travelling large distances to reach the show

A nine-year-old girl took a more comfortable option by taking a nap on top of her great Dane.

Owners left nothing to chance as they arrived at today's show, 
employing a range of novel methods to ensure their immaculately-groomed 
animals arrived at the competition without a potentially devastating dip
in a puddle.

Dominico Traversri opted to hoist Afghan dog Louis onto his shoulders in a fireman's lift while another pet was wheeled into the event in a cage.

A record 2,131 dogs from 41 overseas countries will travel to Birmingham for the annual show, including entrants from Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, none of which have been represented at Crufts before.

A total of 13 new breeds will be making their debut at the event, which has attracted more than 20,500 dogs to its breed-judging, gamekeepers' classes and obedience championships.

The
show, which was first held using the 'Crufts' name in 1891, also 
includes contests to assess agility, heelwork and other disciplines.

Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko 
said: 'The Kennel Club and Crufts committee wish to thank all of those 
taking part in Crufts 2013 for their support.

'The fact that dog owners continue to
come in their thousands to celebrate their dogs on the world's most 
famous dog stage is testament to what a special place Crufts holds in 
the hearts of dog lovers throughout the world.'

Among the main attractions at the 
2013 show is the return of the Crufts Factor competition, the Friends 
for Life award, and Sunday's decision on the prestigious Best in Show 
title.

Determined: The weather may not be the best but thousands of visitors and dogs have been braving the rain to make it to this year's show

Contest: Dogs of all sizes, shapes and colours have been filing in to the NEC today at the start of the four-day-long event 

Mutual admiration? These two dogs took a good look at each other's outfits as they arrived for Crufts. Owners were anxious too keep the rain off their pet's well groomed coats

Ms Kisko added: 'One
of my favourite competitions is Friends for Life - each year we hear 
amazing stories of how dogs have helped people pull through illnesses, 
given those with disabilities a new lease of life or worked with search 
teams to rescue those in need.'

This year's Friends for Life contenders include a Birmingham-based police dog which has been involved in more than 285 arrests and once sniffed out a £10,000 cache of stolen power tools.

Crufts was named after its founder, 
Charles Cruft. The first dog show with the famous 'Crufts name — 
entitled 'Cruft's Greatest Dog Show'— was held at the Royal Agricultural
Hall, in Islington, London in 1891.

By the end of the 19th century,
entries to the event had risen to over 3,000, including royal patronage
from various European countries. Charles Crufts died in 1938. His widow ran the show for four years before selling it to The Kennel Club.

The 1948 show was the first to be held under its new owner and was held at Olympia in London. Since 1991, the event has been held in the National Exhibition Centre (NEC), Birmingham.

Crufts
was officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the 
world's largest dog show in 1991 with 22,973 dogs being exhibited. Since 2010 the show has been broadcast on the More 4 channel.
