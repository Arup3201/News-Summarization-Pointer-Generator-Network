Resignation: Sir Paul Stephenson quit as Metropolitan Police Commissioner this evening

Britain's top police officer accepted a free five-week stay at a top health spa where News of the World hacking suspect Neil Wallis was a PR consultant.

Sir Paul Stephenson was today facing a battle to cling onto his job as it was revealed he accepted the £12,000 freebie from Champneys where the ex-executive editor worked.

The Metropolitan Police Commissioner was already under pressure after it emerged that he hired Mr Wallis as a PR consultant for the force.

Scotland Yard denied that it was the 60-year-old ex-journalist who had arranged the stay for the top officer as he recovered from surgery.

Stephen Purdew the managing director laid on the stay at the resort to provide him with the accommodation.

But the disclosure will raise further questions about Sir Paul's judgment, days after he faced a dressing down from London Mayor Boris Johnson over the PR contract.

Mid-range premier double rooms at the exclusive health resort cost £598 per person in Tring, Hertfordshire.

Neil Wallis - known as Wolfman for his no-nonsense approach in the newsroom - was paid £24,000 by the Met Police in 2009 and 2010 for  'provide strategic communication advice and support'.

His contract was cancelled less than six months before the launch of the Operation Weeting investigation into phone hacking.

The ex-journalist, who was Andy Coulson's deputy editor, was arrested on suspicion of intercepting mobile phones in a dawn swoop on his home in Chiswick, west London on Thursday. He was later released on bail.

After leaving the News of the World in 2009, Mr Wallis had created the set up his own PR consultancy Chamy Media.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said the accommodation had been provided by the Champneys managing director Stephen Purdew who was a personal friend of the Commissioner.

He added that Sir Paul, 57, had 'no idea' that Mr Wallis was employed by Champneys when he accepted the hospitality.

Sir Paul underwent an operation to remove a pre-cancerous tumour from his femur in an operation before Christmas.

In January, Scotland Yard said the growth had caused further damage to the bone, which led to a fracture. As a result, Sir Paul was 
readmitted to hospital and underwent a second 'lengthy and complex' 
operation which prompted a lengthy period of recuperation.

Scotland Yard tonight issued a statement saying: 'Following his operations the Commissioner stayed, with his wife, at Champneys Medical from Monday to Friday over a period of five weeks earlier this year where he underwent an extensive programme of hydro and physiotherapy.

'This enabled him to return to work six weeks earlier than anticipated. As with many officers, the Met paid the intensive physiotherapy costs.

'The accommodation and meals were arranged and provided by Stephen Purdew, managing director of Champneys, who is a personal family friend who has no connection with, or links to, his professional life.

Andy Coulson's deputy Neil Wallis was
 nicknamed 'Wolfman' because he is short, used to have lots of facial 
hair and is aggressive.

The 60-year-old suspect has been described as a 'no-nonsense, larger-than-life character whose every utterance is peppered with expletives'.

He stood down as News of the World's executive editor in 2009 and had been working in PR.

He started working for 
News International in 1986 for 12 years where he held senior positions 
before taking the job of News Editor at The Sun.

In
 1998 he became editor of the People, a job he held for five years 
before returning to become deputy editor of the News of the World in 
2003 working under Andy Coulson.

Wallis led a redesign of the newspaper in 2002 and 
launched a sports supplement to help in a battle against the Daily Star.

'The Commissioner only learnt who the PR consultant for Champneys was following a media enquiry today.

'Although the provision of accommodation was as a result of a family friendship, unconnected with his professional role, in the interests of transparency it was nonetheless recorded in the Commissioner's Gifts and Hospitality Register on his return to work in April.

'This register is published quarterly on the Metropolitan Police service website and the entry for the quarter April to June is due to be published shortly.

'The Commissioner personally paid for all other treatments and extras, including a number of subsequent physiotherapy and cryotherapy appointments at Champneys Medical.'

Mr Wallis's solicitor Phil Smith, of Tuckers Solicitors, said: 'There is no connection whatsoever between any stay Sir Paul Stephenson may have had at Champneys and Neil Wallis.

'Neither Neil Wallis nor anyone connected to him had any involvement whatsoever in any visit or stay by Sir Paul Stephenson at Champneys.'

Stephen Purdew said he was 'outraged' by suggestions the stay was arranged by Mr Wallis.

He said: 'He (Sir Paul) came here to recover from cancer and a broken leg, to say it was a gift or a jolly is outrageous. It is a bloody disgrace.

'He was here for about a month. He was seriously ill so he stayed with me and this has backfired terribly.'

He said the fact Mr Wallis was working as a consultant for Champneys at the same time was coincidental.

'Neil Wallis, by coincidence, did some work for us. I have known Sir Paul Stephenson for twenty-odd years and this is totally unrelated.

'Neil Wallis does not work for us any more. It was a company he was working for, Outside Organisation, that did and this is a diversion. I didn't even know Neil Wallis had done any work for us.

'I don't need my name tarnished in this way, this is wrong.'

A spokesperson for the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'The Metropolitan Police have made assurances that accommodation provided for the Commissioner at Champneys was recorded in the latest update of his Gifts and Hospitality Register, which is due to be published shortly.

'The Mayor has already written to Lord Justice Leveson to request he consider the contract between Chamy Media and the Metropolitan Police as part of his inquiry.

'He expects that the Judge will look to consider this arrangement as well.'
