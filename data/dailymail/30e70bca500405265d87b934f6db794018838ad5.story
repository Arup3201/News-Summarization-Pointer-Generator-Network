Seven people have been injured and more than 500 homes destroyed after a massive fire tore through a slum in India.

Dozens of fire engines were called to the Vasant Kunj slum cluster in southern New Delhi, and spent two hours battling the flames before they were finally able to get them under control.

By the time the fire was out, more than half of the thatched huts in the desperately poor neighborhood had been destroyed, leaving great mountains of smouldering debris - including plastic bottles, tarps, rubber tires and scraps of wood.

The cause 
of the fire is not yet known, but it seems likely to have been started 
either by someone cooking on charcoal in one of the cramped alleyways, 
or by electrical short circuit from the many thousands of illegal power connections.

Fanned by a breeze, the fire gained momentum once it hit an open yard area filled with dry wood and plastic.

It spread further as gas cylinders kept inside the thatched huts for cooking began exploding.

Seven people were taken to hospital to 
be treated for smoke inhalation or burn wounds, although there have been
 no reported fatalities, according to fire department official Shyam 
Lal.

Desperate: An Indian woman holds her children outside their burnt-out home. Flames ripped through the New Delhi slum this morning, destroying nearly 500 thatched huts and leaving already impoverished families homeless

Tears: A man weeps as he sits amidst the remains of his home. Dozens of fire engines were called to the Vasant Kunj slum cluster in south New Delhi shortly after 8.30am this morning, and spent two hours battling the flames before they were finally able to get them under control

Lost: This man is hunting for his belongings in the remains of his home. About 500 slum dwellings in the area were destroyed, although no fatalities have been reported

Gutted: By the time the fire was out, more than half of the thatched huts in the desperately poor neighborhood had been destroyed, leaving great piles of rubble and corrugated iron

Despair: Indian men sit near the remains of their home after the fire broke out in a slum area of New Delhi. 35 fire engines and 15 ambulances attended the scene

Fire: The cause of the fire is not yet known, but it seems likely to have been started either by someone cooking on charcoal in one of the cramped alleyways, or by electrical short circuit from the many thousands of illegal power connections (seen in the distance)

Hopeless: A group of men stand and look at the remains of 500 homes in Vasant Kunj slum in southern New Delhi. Thousands of people are thought to have been left homeless as a result of the fire

A family eats a meal near the remains of their burnt-out home. Slum fires are usually sparked by charcoal cooking or electrical short circuits from the many thousands of illegal power connections. The majority of slum areas in India are built illegally without any safety standards

Chaos: A man stands outside his destroyed home and observes the devastation around him. Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung visited the site shortly after the flames were doused and ordered the building of emergency medical camps

Future: Mr Jung demanded the construction of temporary overnight shelters offering clean drinking water and basic food parcels, and hinted that those caught up in the fire may well be eligible for compensation

Aid: Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung said rescue workers needed to draw in more staff to ensure any remaining residents who have not yet sought help - especially women and children - are able to receive treatment

Battle: Fanned by a breeze, the fire gained momentum once it hit an open yard area filled with dry wood and plastic. It spread further as gas cylinders kept inside the thatched huts for cooking began exploding

Scene of devastation: Seven people were taken to hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation or burn wounds, although there have been no reported fatalities, according to fire department official Shyam Lal
