Passengers traveling on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles learned their plane was carrying some very special cargo as they neared the end of their journey.

Around 40 minutes before their aircraft came into land, they were informed by the pilot that their plane was delivering the body of a fallen soldier back to his family.

John E. DiScala wrote on his travel site JohnnyJet.com the pilot told passengers the flight would be greeted by a group of fire trucks and a water cannon salute.

'The water glistening on the window panes looked like tears,' he wrote in an emotionally charged blog.

Respects: Passengers paid a silent tribute as the fallen soldiers' coffin was unloaded from the planes' cargo hold

Salute: A water cannon salute from LAX fire trucks welcomed the flight into the terminal

Poetic: Johnny Discala who writes a travel blog wrote 'The water glistening on the window panes looked like tears.'

Duties: Every military branch has its own honor guard, usually military in nature. One of the primary roles for honor guards is to provide funeral honors for fallen comrades

'Passengers in the airport must have been worried when they saw our plane pull into the gate, as we had a full police and fire escort, front and back.

I was on the left side of the plane and later realized that the family could be seen off to the right, standing with the United States Army Honor Guard,' Mr Discala wrote.

Every military branch has its own honor guard, usually military in nature, and is composed of volunteers who are carefully screened.

One of the primary roles for honor guards is to provide funeral honors for fallen comrades.

An honor: A military soldier came on board to thank the passengers for bringing home the body to the family of the fallen

A difference in mood: Passengers stood to pay their respects instead of rushing off to collect their bags of join the taxi rank

Soon after the flight had touched down, a military officer stepped on board and addressed the passengers.

'It is a sworn oath to bring home to the family the fallen,' the officer said. 'Today, you all did that. You are all escorts, escorts of the heart.'

Mr Discala wrote the mood on the plane was drastically different from anything else he'd ever encountered.

'Everyone was silent, no one got up, not even that person from the back row who pretends they don’t speak English so they can be first off the plane.

I’m sure most had meteor-sized lumps in their throats and tears in their eyes like I did.'

After passengers disembarked, instead of them rushing to make a connection or head for the baggage claim, a group gathered by the window overlooking the gate.

'They witnessed something truly moving,' Mr DiScala wrote.

An American flag-draped coffin was unloaded from the plane in front of the soldier’s family.

'To see the Honor Guard and family waiting patiently, while LAX baggage handlers and a military loadmaster remove the flag covered casket first from the cargo hold, was humbling to say the least,' he contemplates.

Mr DiScala noticed a woman whom he believed to be the soldier’s mother stepping away from a crowd of relatives huddled in blankets and walk towards the casket.

'As soon as I saw her reach out to put her hand on her baby’s casket, I walked away,' he wrote.
