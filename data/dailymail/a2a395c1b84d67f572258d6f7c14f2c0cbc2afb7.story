Manchester United summer signings Angel di Maria and Daley Blind have praised the club's fans after settling in well to life at Old Trafford.

Di Maria left Real Madrid to become Manchester United's record signing for £60milion and has since impressed with a series of fine performances.

Dutchman Daley Blind made the switch from his boyhood club Ajax to United and both players have signalled out the warm welcome from fans behind their strong starts.

Manchester United playmaker Angel di Maria has made an excellent start to life at Old Trafford

'The people here are amazing,' Di Maria told Inside United.

'I feel really comfortable, very happy and really pleased. The way that people treat you really makes you feel good in your heart.

'I have not really had much of a chance to get to know the city very well, with the move and with my family, but I am really pleased and happy to be here. So far I have just been going to work and then going home.

United are eighth in the Premier League, but Di Maria insists he is happy and proud to be at Old Trafford

'When I first arrived here, I was in the city centre for a couple of days but I have seen nothing else really, but I plan to in the future.

'When we are coming out after training or after the games, I have had a chance to meet some of the fans and it makes me happy that they love us so much and have got so much affection for us.

'I am trying to do my best to pay them back when I am on the field, so that the people are happy. They are really polite, they are always saying please and always saying thank you. That is really nice and I am really happy here.'

Daley Blind, celebrates scoring at West Brom, has thanked the Man United fans for making him feel welcome

The majority of Manchester United fans have stuck by their team despite a rocky start to the season, and Blind was keen to show his gratitude.

'Having everybody behind you at Old Trafford all the time is great as well,' he said.

'The fans are always singing and supporting you. When things aren't going well, they still carry on supporting you and that really pushes you on and makes you want to give your most.'
