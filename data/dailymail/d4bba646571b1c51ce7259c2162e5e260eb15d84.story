Frank Lampard is to be offered an ambassadorial role with the FA as part of a strategy to keep former England players involved with the national team.

The Manchester City midfielder’s stock has soared since being being forced out of Chelsea in the summer. He signed to play for New York City in Major League Soccer in the new year but FA chiefs want to tap into his vast experience.

Although the 36-year-old retired from international duty after winning his 106th cap at the World Cup, Lampard impressed England boss Roy Hodgson and FA officials with the way he mentored the squad’s young players in Brazil.

Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard, who also retired from international football in the summer, is another earmarked for an ambassadorial post.
