Meanwhile, Aguero revealed on Friday he didn't even know who Messi was the first time they met.

Speaking to City TV, he said: 'I was about to turn 17. We were both called up for some friendlies. We were at the AFA (Argentine Football Association) training complex. We were sitting at the table with him, (Ezequiel) Garay and (Mauro) Formica.

'He sat beside me. I looked at him but I didn't know him. They were talking about Nike football boots and Garay was saying that they were really good.

The two Argentine forwards are now good friends, despite their bizarre first meeting

'Then Leo said: "They've brought them from the USA" so I started thinking: "Where is this guy from?"

'I couldn't resist and I asked him: "What's your name?"

'He said: "Leo" and I asked: "and what's your last name?"

'He said: "Messi" and I didn't know him. I asked him again to see if his name sounded familiar. He laughed then we all laughed. They made fun of me.'
