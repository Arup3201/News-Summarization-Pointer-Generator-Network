This week I'm going back to the Swinging Sixties to create a look inspired by one of the era's most influential icons Twiggy, with the help of one of my good friends, talented make-up artist Olivia Newman-Young.

Olivia created for me a striking yet wearable Twiggy-inspired look with dewy skin, babydoll lashes and faux freckles. If you've got a fancy dress party coming up or simply want to get more creative with your make-up choices, this modern twist on a 60s look is surprisingly not too hard to achieve – here's how!

To provide a fresh, glowy base and cover any blemishes, Olivia applied a layer of Clarins True Radiance Perfect Skin Foundation over my face, before moving on to the main focus of the look – the eyes.

Sixties chic: Binky chanelled Twiggy for this week's beauty look

First, she took the Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet across my socket line, from the inner to the outer corner, to create the quintessentially 60s ‘hollowed socket' effect. 

She smudged the line with a small round ended brush to make it softer, and flicked it out slightly towards the outer corners.

She then took the white highlighter shade from the Guerlain Eyebrow Kit to accentuate the area of my lid under the drawn-on line. To make the look modern and wearable, she used a slightly sheerer white highlighter shade, but any white or cream-coloured shadow should do the trick. 

Feeling squiffy? Binky was looking a little worse for wear as she headed out with her Chelsea chums last night however her Sixties makeover sees her looking much more polished

To reinforce the eye line, she also dabbed the black eyebrow shade from the Guerlain palette over the pencil.

Next, Olivia applied the Dior Addict It-Line Liquid Eyeliner very close to my lash line to add further definition. I do find liquid liner tricky to use sometimes - if you struggle with it too, simply dot the product over the lash line first for a basic outline and then go over it slowly.

As well as being one of Twiggy's staple beauty features, defined, doll-like, spiky lashes were all over the AW14 catwalks. Olivia began by defining my bottom lashes with Dior Addict It-Lash Mascara, applying layer after layer until we achieved the desired volume. 

She then applied a fluttery set of falsies to my top lashes followed by a few individual false lashes across my bottom ones, to really make my eyes pop.

Olivia then used the Clarins Instant Concealer under my eyes to cover any eyeshadow or mascara fallout, setting it in place with a translucent powder. She deliberately used one shade lighter than my skintone to disguise eye bags and brighten up my eye area, as well as to highlight my nose and Cupid's bow.

Next, Olivia added some definition to my face with a light dusting of Michael Kors Bronzing Powder in Sporty over my cheekbones. Fresh skin and doe eyes are the two main beauty components forming this look, so even if you're a tanaholic like myself, try to keep the bronze at bay!

In keeping with Twiggy's usual beauty choices, Olivia decided to keep my lips muted, enhancing them with a slick of the gorgeous pinky-nude Michael Kors Lip Lacquer in Diva.

Finally – for an authentic Twiggy-style look, Olivia dotted some faux freckles across my nose and cheeks using the Clarins Eyebrow Pencils in Dark Brown and Light Brown, using varying amounts of pressure to keep them looking natural.

You can get all the products Olivia used from Escentual.com, and do check out her YouTube channel for some more amazing beauty tutorials and lifestyle videos.

Make-up: done. Now to grab my favourite shift dress, perfect my bouffant and hit the town! Hope you all have a fantastic bank holiday weekend.

Lots of love,
