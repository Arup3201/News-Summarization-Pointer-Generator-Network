An elderly woman has been reduced to tears after being handed a Burger King receipt which called her and and daughter-in-law 'b**** a** hoes'.

The grandmother, who would only give her names as Lorel, said she went to the fast food chain in Richmond, Central Virginia, on Sunday night to buy dinner.

However she was left horrified and upset after she was handed a receipt with the offensive phrase printed at the top.

Offensive: An elderly woman and her daughter-in-law were handed this receipt at a Burger King in Virginia which labelled them as 'b**** a** hoes'

In an interview with CBS 6 she said: 'This is more than an insult. I mean calling you names on a piece of a paper, that will hurt somebody.

'I liked going there. But after this they wonâ€™t get my business anymore.'

Speaking about the manager, she added: 'He did apologise. He also called the young lady over and asked her, "did you see this?" She just shook her head. He said it had never happened before.'

According to the TV station a dsitrict manager of Burger King said the chain was 'dealing with it', and that they were using CCTV tapes to try and track down the culprit.

Lorel is not the first person to be insulted on a receipt.

In April last year a father received the note 'f****** needy kids' on his bill after asking for an extra chicken leg for his son.

The grandmother, who gave her name as Lorel, said she will not go back to the restaurant (file pic)

Joseph Gibson stopped at a St Louis bar called Friendly's on a day out with his son when the incident happened.

The store manager later apologised, saying a female waitress had put it on the bill as a joke, intending to remove it before handing it over.

In November last year a lesbian waitress and former Marine also posted a receipt showing on offensive letter a family had apparently left for her instead of tipping.

The note, left for Danya Morales, 22, at the Bridgewater Bistro in New Jersey, said: 'Sorry, I cannot tip because I do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life'.

Ms Morales then received thousands of dollars in donations after she claimed to be collecting for a gay rights charity.

However following protests from the family, and no money being given to the charity, Ms Morales admitted the receipt had been a fake and was fired.
