It may be the must-have smartphone accessory this year.

But a photo has emerged that shows the 'selfie stick' is not an entirely new invention and is in fact almost 90 years old.

An image, taken of a couple in 1926, shows Arnold and Helen Hogg using a stick to take a picture of themselves on the street they lived in in Rugby, Warwickshire, just a year after they were married.

A photo taken using a 'selfie stick' has emerged showing the popular modern device was being used in 1926

The photograph, annotated with the words 'Self Taken, Oct 1926' is evidence that people were using selfie sticks to capture images of themselves long before the phenomenon was made popular this year by celebrities.

The picture is only two inches wide and was found stuck in the back of a family album by the Hoggs’ grandson Alan Cleaver, of Whitehaven in Cumbria. It features the couple and shows the stick visible and being held by Mr Hogg.

'In our family it's always been a favourite photo and the fact that there is so much interest in it now would have been loved by granddad,' said Mr Cleaver. 

'My granddad didn't take too many photos throughout his life but he took quite a few after he got married in the 1920s. We have a few photo albums of that time but most of them were quite boring, and then we found this photo stuck at the back. 

'He was obviously trying something new.

'Sadly we think it's the only one he took like this that he felt happy enough to include in the album.' 

Mr Cleaver said his grandfather was an entertainer and musician but admits he never saw him use the 'selfie stick' .

His grandfather used to play the piano at silent films where he lived in Rugby and would often entertain people wherever he went. During a family holiday to Benidorm in 1969 he was given a medal by a hotel owner after he delighted guests with his piano playing. 

Mr Cleaver added: 'I don't really know what was going on or why he chose to use the stick. His wife Helen looks suitably bemused in the photo. 

'But it's absolutely no surprise he took something like this. He was always mucking about and trying to entertain people. I think he looks a bit like Charlie Chaplin in the photograph and he was a bit like him in real life. If you were in a pub and heard laughter it was always guaranteed to be him. He was an absolute star and a granddad you would dream of.

The selfie stick has become a modern day gadget for tourists keen to picture themselves at landmarks 

Celebrities have popularised the selfie, such as this picture taken on a mobile phone and featuring Jared Leto, Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Ellen DeGeneres, Bradley Cooper, Peter Nyongío Jr., and, second row, from left, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, Lupita Nyongío and Angelina Jolie

Scots adventurer Will Copestake took this picture of himself on a sheet of ice close to a glacier in Patagonia 

'He never spoke about the selfie stick. And I have no idea how he used it. Various photographic experts have had in depth discussions about what he was doing. Cameras in those days worked by the shutter being pulled on the side of the camera. He was probably just using the stick to hold the camera in position.'  

Selfie sticks have risen in popularity this year, with people going to great lengths to capture the perfect images of themselves leaning over precipices, in impossible poses and with stunning landmarks in the background.

The devices were named as one of the greatest inventions of 2014 by Time Magazine and the modern-day contraption originated in Asia. They work by holding the camera in place at the end of the stick, usually about 3ft long, and have a button on the handle which presses the shutter so the photo can be taken. 

Selfie sticks are similar to monopods used with digital cameras but were invented specifically for smartphones this year.
