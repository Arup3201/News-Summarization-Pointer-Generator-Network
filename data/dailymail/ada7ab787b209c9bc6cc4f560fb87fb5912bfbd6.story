A Phoenix man inspired to create an all-terrain wheelchair so his disabled wife could go on camping trips has teamed up with the NFL to gift veterans his so-called 'Tankchair'.

Inventor Brad Soden was left distraught ten years ago when his wife Liz broke down in tears because she couldn't travel with their five kids to the country and resolved to solve the problem not just for her, but for others in the same situation.

Despite having no formal engineering training, Sodden created the first tankchair in his own garage using caterpillar tracks instead of wheels, so that driver could traverse most types of terrain, including low lying water and even snow.

'When you're in a wheelchair, it’s not just your problem,' said Soden to AZFamily. 'It’s a family problem because the family has to deal with it.'

'My poor wife. She tried to keep going and the wheelchair kept getting stuck,' he said.

'Our kids trying to push her, and get her going, and she started crying, said go on without me, and I just found that unacceptable.'

His first attempt at a modified wheelchair for his wife was based on an off-road cart, but he abandoned this because they would not be allowed at the majority of campgrounds nationwide because of their noise and restrictions on gas.

His father-in-law was the one who gave him inspiration when he asked, 'Wouldn't it be cool if you could put tracks on that like a tank?'

Soden, who had prior military experience as an infantryman who worked on tracked vehicles, used trial and error before his first genuine prototype was presented to his wife.

'The 10 million jumbo watt smile she had on her face when she came back from her hike was worth every minute I spent in the garage putting it together,' said Soden to KTAR.

Since then, Tankchair has expanded to improve the design of his invention with the help of Arizona firm, NPC Robotics and began selling the chairs.

He noticed that a large majority of his clients for his customized chairs were injured servicemen and women.

Relief: Each chair is customized to the user's specifications and cost upwards of $15,000 and are all assembled in Brad Soden's own garage

Each tankchair is built to order and costs around $15,000 and many of the parts are assembled by Soden in his own garage.

According to the Washington Post he has built versions that incorporate a fishing rod and a text-to-speech system for one man who was unable to speak.

Another version was built for a cop complete with an LED Incapacitator, which induces vomiting in suspects by flashing a pulsating light at them.

'The best part about building that one,' he said to the Washington Post, 'was that it helped the injured client, who was a cop, get back being a cop again.'

Joy: This veteran has taken delivery of his own 'Tankchair' and is now getting ready for his test-drive

Inspiration: Brad was consulted by the makers of the Pixar smash hit movie Wall-E 

So original was his idea that Soden was approached by the makers of the Pixar film Wall-E, who wanted his help in directing their artists to get the correct feel for the titular hero.

And over the next few weeks, Soden will be traveling the country delivering five new tankchairs to veterans backed by an NFl Hall of Famers initiative to get more disabled servicemen and women the chairs.

Since his wife's accident 15-years-ago, Soden has developed his chair to the point where he is testing a new model that could be capable of traveling up to 30 mph.

He calls it the Speedster according to the Washington Post, likening it to a Ferrari, whereas he calls the tankchair a 'truck'.

'For the longest time, we’ve been used to wheelchairs that limit people,' said Soden to the Washington Post.

'For me, it’s about changing the way people think about where you can go and what you can do with them.'
