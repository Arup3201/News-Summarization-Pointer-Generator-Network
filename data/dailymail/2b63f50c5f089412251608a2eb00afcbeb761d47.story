Education Secretary Michael today launches a consultation on new content for GCSE and A-level exams

Teenagers should learn about the ‘real world’ in school including maths lessons in mortality and health statistics.

Under plans to toughen up qualifications, the government said children should write their own programs in computer science GCSE and learn about the culture and ‘sociological issues’ of a country in language A-levels.

The move is designed to help students better compete for apprenticeships, university places and jobs in the global labour market.

The government is reforming A-levels following concerns from academics that current qualifications are not adequately preparing students for degree level courses.

GCSEs are also being revamped to make them more rigorous than previous specifications, placing them on a par with education systems across the world.  

Education Secretary Michael Gove will today launch consultations on new content for A and AS-levels in maths, further maths, geography, ancient languages, modern foreign languages, PE, music and dance.

There is a new emphasis on problem solving in maths A-levels.

For the first time, students must interpret at least one real, large data set for example mortality and health statistics for countries across the world.

In geography A-level, there will be a ‘better balance between physical and human geography’ and a focus on fieldwork.

Students will be required to study global systems and governance, landscape systems as well as water and carbon cycling. 

This follows feedback from universities that students often arrive without any ‘substantive’ experience of independent research and fieldwork.

In modern foreign language A-levels, sixth-formers will be expected to ‘use language spontaneously’ in discussions.

They must learn about the ‘literature, culture and sociological issues in the countries where the language of study is spoken’, according to the Department for Education.

There was no requirement to learn about the society of a country under the previous specification.

In PE, students will have to demonstrate their ability to use modelling and data analysis to evaluate physical activity.

subjects, is designed to help students better compete for

Academics have complained that current A-level PE students have little experience of critical thinking, data analysis or research.

Mr Gove will also today publish proposed new content for GCSEs in art and design, dance, computer science, music and PE.

Computer science GCSEs will require teenagers to analyse and solve problems, write and refine programmes and understand key mathematical principles.

They must also learn about data representation and Boolean logic, a form of algebra in which all values are reduced to either ‘true’ or ‘false’.

These minimum requirements were developed with advice from organisations including the British Computer Society, E-Skills UK, Naace and the Royal Society of Engineers.

Music GCSE will also become more demanding, with teenagers facing new minimum requirements for the length of time they must spend performing and composing.  

PE has more ‘theoretical and scientific content’, requiring students to understand how anatomy and physiology, psychology and socio-cultural influences impact performance.

Dance GCSE students must understand the context of choreography and performance and pupils will have to better grasp the use of colour, line, tone and texture in art and design GCSEs.

All the subjects being consulted on will be taught in schools from 2016.

Charlie Stripp, chief executive of maths in education and industry, welcomed the greater stress on problem solving and modelling in maths A-levels.

He said: ‘This, along with the innovative approach to statistics involving the use of technology to analyse large sets of real data, can deepen students’ understanding of mathematics and how it is used.’

The Cultural Learning Alliance, a group of organisations working across the arts, cultural and educational sectors, said new content for arts subjects would help pupils develop critical thinking and ‘hone technical skills’.

'Coupled with real world, fit for purpose assessment it will provide a new foundation for developing demanding and inspiring GCSEs and A-levels that meet pupil and employer needs,’ a spokesman said.

A Department for Education spokesman added: ‘These rigorous new exams will equip our children with the best skills and education so they can fulfil their ambitions and succeed in a global workforce.’
