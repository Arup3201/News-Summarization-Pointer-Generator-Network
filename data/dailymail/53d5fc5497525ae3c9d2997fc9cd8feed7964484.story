Nestled quietly to the side of the M25, it appears to be like any other commuter village. 

But among the cluster of well-kept houses and  community centres lies a group of residents living life a little differently.

For the people of Spielplatz in Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire, form one of the country's few naked villages, having lived in the nude for more than 85 years.

A documentary exposing the lifestyle of a small community of naturists in a small village on London's commuter belt will be shown next month. Tina and Mark Yates (pictured above in the community's local pub) have been living in Spielplatz since visiting so that Mrs Yates could overcome body self-consciousness 

Their lifestyle has been laid bare in a new documentary offering the outside world a glimpse into naturism.  

Among those enjoying life in Spielplatz - which means playground in German - is Iseult ­Richardson, 82, whose father founded the community in 1929. 

'There is no difference between naturists and people who live up the street,' she insisted. 

'We all live normal lives but are just lucky enough to live in this extraordinary place.' 

Properties in the village mainly comprise of two-bedroom bungalows which sell for £85,000, the Mirror reports. 

The couple are among 34 home-owners who live permanently at the site that is a stone's throw from the M25

Everyday activities such as meal times and trips to the small, local pub are normally carried out in the nude 

Wellington boots are reserved for gardening while residents can also choose to wear clothes if feeling chilly. Vic Lightfoot, the club's financial director, has trouble persuading girlfriend Maggie (pictured left) to strip off

Residents also have the option to wear clothes if they want to when it is cold or they are doing daily chores

While residents prefer stripping off, they will adorn wellingtons, trousers or appropriate clothing when carrying out tasks like gardening. 

Trips to their own local pub, swimming sessions and meal times are all performed in the nude. 

Earlier this year one woman spoke of how life in the village cured her of body esteem issues. 

Tina Yates was self-conscious of a scar on her abdomen following an operation, and was taken to Spielplatz by her naturist husband in the hope it may cheer her up. 

Soon the pensioner had let go of all her previous body hang-ups, and the couple settled in permanently. 

While those living behind its fences are free of inhibitions, tensions are fraught over an ongoing debate about whether to force visitors to bare all when they come to see family.  

The Naked Village will be shown on More 4 on December 11 at 9pm.
