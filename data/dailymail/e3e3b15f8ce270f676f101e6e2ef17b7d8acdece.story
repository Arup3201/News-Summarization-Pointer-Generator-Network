The Massachusetts teen whose rapist now wants custody of their child is now swinging back at both him and the state of Massachusetts, which she says has allowed him to continue to victimize her using the court system.

The unnamed victim, 19, was 14-years-old at the time of the rape and says she is still trying to get away from him because a Bay State judge turned the case over to family court, allowing rapist Jamie Melendez, 24, to petition for visitation and other rights.

'That's what makes this case so barbaric,' said the victim's attorney Wendy Murphy.

'That's what makes this case so barbaric': The unnamed victim appeared in disguise alongside her attorney Wendy Murphy in a television interview in which she says she still being victimized by her rapist

Fatherly? An undated photo shows Jamie Melendez, who pleaded guilty to th 2009 statutory rape. He decided to sue for visitation rights only after he was ordered to pay child support

'This case was ordered to be transferred to family court,' she told CNN, 'by a judge who found a man guilty of rape.'

Melendez, then 20, pleaded guilty to a statutory rape that took place in the victim's own home in 2009 and led to her pregnancy. He was sentenced to 16 years probation.

Melendez was later ordered to pay $110 a week in child support to her by the family court.

But last year Melendez filed a petition in a family court to argue that he should have visitation rights if he is forced to pay child support to the girl. She is expected to now have to fight this in family court.

'He gets to then literally use the family court system to control his rape victim's life,' said Murphy.

He offered to no longer request these rights if the child maintenance order was made void. His victim was a middle school student at the time of the attack but recently graduated from high school.

Murphy criticised the original decision to force Melendez to pay child support as ‘outrageous’ and said it framed his behaviour as something ‘other than a serious crime’.

She told ABC: ‘My client is very worried she'll have to send her daughter off to this man she doesn't know, and tell her she'll be going off on visits with the man who raped her mother and created her.

‘She wants nothing to do with this guy. She doesn't want a 16-year relationship with him.’

The attorney added that the girl is concerned about 
risking losing the custody of her child if she does not participate in 
the family court proceedings.

Melendez - who had known his victim for 
three years before the attack - had gone to the girl’s house when he 
knew her mother would not be home, and pressured her into having sex 
with him.

She had asked a state criminal court judge to order Melendez to pay criminal restitution instead of child support - and free her from any legal relationship or proceedings with him.

But this was refused - and an application for review to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court also failed, as well as a further appeal. She is now suing the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in Federal Court and wants an annulment of the court order, reported Courthouse News.
