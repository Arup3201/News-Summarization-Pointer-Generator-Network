A Minnesota teen died Friday night after jumping into a lake as part of a 'Cold Water Challenge.'

Davis Colley, 16, texted his girlfriend before he jumped into Eagle Lake, his friends told the Associated Press. They also said they did not know why he did it or was alone.

Colley's body was found by deputies around 11pm, who earlier received word around 7:30pm that a teen went underwater but never came back up, 
the AP reports.

His death is still being investigated.

In the 'Cold Water Challenge,' individuals are 'nominated' to jump into a cold body of water. After their swim is taped and posted online, they nominate someone else.

If a nominee doesn't agree to jump, he or she usually makes a donation to charity, though rules may vary from region to region.

Colley was on the wrestling team at Central High School in Norwood Young America, according to his obituary. He is survived by parents Wayne and Shannon Colley-Davis, as well as siblings Ivan Davis and Kava Colley-Davis.

A Facebook memorial page has been set up in Colley's memory. A fundraiser page has also been set up to raise money for his family.
