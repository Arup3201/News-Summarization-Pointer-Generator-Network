Call to action: The Prime Minister said today that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon had made it clear she was 'up for a coalition' with the Labour party

David Cameron warned Scots that a vote for any party other than the Conservatives would let Ed Miliband into Downing Street - and allow Alex Salmond back into a position of power.

The Prime Minister said today that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon had made it clear she was 'up for a coalition' with the Labour party  in the event of a hung parliament.

He added this would lead to the 'very real prospect' of Alex Salmond, who is standing for election as an MP for the Scottish nationalists this May, having the 'decisive say' in the running of the country.  

Mr Cameron told the Scottish Conservative conference: 'If you vote for anyone else apart from the Conservatives you are voting for this outcome: Labour in government. Ed Miliband in Downing Street ... and the very real prospect of Alex Salmond coming in through the back door.'

On the return of Mr Salmond, who is standing for election in Gordon, Mr Cameron said that 'like a horror movie, he's back'.

The Prime Minister added: 'Only this time he's not running Scotland. He would have the decisive say in running a country he wants to see abolished, our United Kingdom.' 

He said it was 'appalling' that Labour and Mr Miliband had failed to rule out doing a deal with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament, branding them 'spineless, weak, unprincipled, short-termist'.

He told the conference: 'That is all anyone needs to know about today's Labour Party.' 

He added the Conservatives were the 'bedrock' of the pro-UK campaign in the run-up to last September's Scottish independence referendum.

But after 'battling' to keep the United Kingdom together, he warned that there was still a threat to Scotland's future from the prospect of a Labour government.

He told the conference 'a major risk to Scotland's future remains' from the economic policies of Labour if Ed Balls succeed in becoming the chancellor after the election.

He said: 'We fought to stop the risk of break-up. Now we have to fight to stave off the risk of bankruptcy.'

He hit out at the economic policies of Labour and the SNP, telling the conference: 'Our opponents bleat on about "austerity" but I tell you - if we don't grip these debts, they will grip us.

'And there will be less and less money for our schools, hospitals, communities, pensions - for everything that makes life worthwhile.'

After Ms Sturgeon made a speech in London where she blasted Conservative spending cuts as 'morally unjustifiable', Mr Cameron hit back at the SNP leader.

Decisive say: Cameron said if Labour was to come into power it would lead to the 'very real prospect' of Alex Salmond, right, having the 'decisive say' in the running of the country. Left, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon

'I'll tell you what is "morally unjustifiable", First Minister. And that is racking up more debt than our children and grandchildren could ever hope to re-pay. 

'Passing the buck like every other hopeless left-wing administration in history.

'And that's why it will be us - the Conservative Party - who will do the right thing, clear up this mess - and leave Scotland standing taller.'

The economic policies his party has pursued means 'we'll be able to look our children and grandchildren in the eye and know we did the right thing'.

In his speech today, Mr Cameron also defended the introduction of the benefits reforms introduced by the Government, saying: 'We came in with a mission to restore the right values. 

'No more something for nothing. No more taking without contributing. Above all - work must always pay. That's what the benefit cap is about. That's what Universal Credit is about. And it's working.'  

In a rallying cry Mr Cameron spoke about the country's spirit which 'really makes Britain special'. 

He also praised aid workers such as Pauline Cafferkey, who contracted Ebola while volunteering in Africa, speaking about their 'spirit of compassion'.

The Prime Minister told the conference: 'That is Britain. No other country on earth has this combination of guts and grit, heart and brains.

'And no other country on earth is such a powerful example of how people of all different faiths and beliefs and nationalities can live together.

'None of us are just English, or Scottish, or Welsh. Or a Londoner or a Glaswegian, or West Indian or Asian. We're all British too.

'That's what we are - all of us, whatever our background, wherever we're from. We're all British.

Warning: Mr Cameron, pictured today, said the Tories had 'battled' to keep the United Kingdom together, but warned that there was still a threat to Scotland's future from the prospect of a Labour government

'And our goal in this party is to show people, over the coming weeks and months and years - how we take these ingredients and make our country an even better place to live.'

But SNP deputy leader Stewart Hosie said: 'The Tories have been rejected in election after election in Scotland, and only a strong team of SNP MPs will be able to exert power at Westminster on behalf of the people of Scotland - standing up for Scottish interests, and opposing the Tory obsession with austerity.

'The Tories are right to be concerned that a strong SNP vote will stand in the way of their damaging agenda - a poll earlier this month showed that people in Scotland are backing the SNP to keep the Tories out of office.' 

Mr Cameron was also in Scotland to announce the backing of Scottish shipbuilding with an £859million investment in the next generation of Royal Navy frigates to be built on the River Clyde.

The Prime Minister said the money will be spent on developing the Type 26 warship and sustain 1,700 jobs across the country.
