Announcement: Barack Obama said his new policy on immigration was 'the right thing to do'

Barack Obama’s decision to allow up to allow up to 800,000 young illegal immigrants to remain in America has divided Republicans and was met with silence by his 2012 opponent Mitt Romney for nearly six hours.

The Obama administration’s announcement that it would stop deporting and begin granting work permits to younger illegal immigrants who came to the US as children and have led law-abiding lives caught Romney by surprise.

Eventually, Romney came out and said in almost conciliatory language that he believed Obama had addressed an ‘important matter’ with a short-term measure but the way it had been done ‘makes it more difficult to reach that long-term solution.

He said that he supported a statement by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who had been working on a proposal that Obama appeared to have hijacked.

Romney’s belated and muted reaction underlined just what a bind Republicans had been placed in.

Speaking in the Rose Garden about the announcement, Obama said it was a ‘just’ thing to do but not a permanent solution to the immigration issue. ‘This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It is not a permanent fix.’

By bypassing Congress and acting via executive order, Obama’s move is designed to tie Romney to an unpopular Capitol Hill as well as courting Latino voters, a key bloc in swing states like Florida, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado.

With some conservative sympathetic to Rubio’s proposal, not yet formally presented, and other against it, the Obama administration’s surprise announcement laid bare a split in the Republican party.

In a measured statement, Rubio, of Cuban parentage and a leading vice-presidential candidate for the Romney ticket, said it was ‘welcome news for many of these kids desperate for an answer’ but Obama was guilty of ‘ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress’.

Obama’s executive order was a ‘short term answer to a long term problem’, he added. ‘There is broad support for the idea that we should figure out a way to help kids who are undocumented through no fault of their own, but there is also broad consensus that it should be done in a way that does not encourage illegal immigration in the future.

‘This is a difficult balance to strike, one that this new policy, imposed by executive order, will make harder to achieve in the long run.’

Rick Santorum, runner up to Romney in
 the Republican primaries blasted Obama. ‘Here we are again on a Friday 
afternoon on a quiet summer weekend with no one paying attention and 
President Obama announces yet another abuse of power - a decision to 
stop deporting and grant work permits to nearly one million immigrants 
who entered or remained in the United States illegally as children,’ he 
said.

Representative Steve King of Iowa, a 
favourite among conservative hardliners, said the change in the law 
‘signifies to potential illegal aliens that border agents will turn a 
blind eye’.

Senator Lindsey Graham of South 
Carolina, said via twitter: ‘President Obama’s attempt to go around 
Congress and the American people is at best unwise and possibly 
illegal.’

He added: ‘This type of policy proposal, regardless of motivation, will entice people to break our laws.’

Obama’s order bypasses Congress and 
partially achieves the goals of the so-called DREAM Act, a long-sought 
but never enacted plan to establish a path toward citizenship for young 
people who came to the United States illegally as children but who 
attend college or join the military.

It came a week before Obama’s address
 the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials' 
annual conference in Orlando, Florida. Romney is due to speak there on 
Thursday.

Under the administration plan, 
illegal immigrants will be immune from deportation if they were brought 
to the US before age 16 and are younger than 30, have been in the 
country for at least five continuous years, have no criminal history, 
graduated from a US high school or earned a GED, or served in the 
military.

Should illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children but now lead law-abiding lives be allowed to stay?

They also can apply for a work permit that will be good for two years with no limits on how many times it can be renewed.

Janet Napolitano, Homeland Security 
Secretary, said in a memorandum: ‘Many of these young people have 
already contributed to our country in significant ways, Prosecutorial 
discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially 
justified here.'

The policy will not lead toward 
citizenship but will remove the threat of deportation and grant the 
ability to work legally, leaving eligible immigrants able to remain in 
the US for extended periods.

Obama's extraordinary move comes in an election year in which the Hispanic vote
 could be critical in swing states like Colorado, Nevada and Florida.

While Obama enjoys support from a majority of Hispanic voters, Latino 
enthusiasm for the president has been tempered by the slow economic 
recovery, his inability to win congressional support for a broad 
overhaul of immigration laws and by his administration's aggressive 
deportation policy.

Activists opposing his deportation 
policies last week mounted a hunger strike at an Obama campaign office 
in Denver, and other protests were planned for this weekend.

Significant pause? Romney did not use the opportunity to speak about Obama's immigration announcement

The change is likely to cause an outcry from congressional Republicans, who are sure to perceive Obama's actions as an end run around them. Republicans already have complained that previous administration uses of prosecutorial discretion in deportations amount to back-door amnesty.

Romney and many Republican lawmakers want tighter border security measures before considering changes in immigration law. Romney opposes offering legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college but has said he would do so for those who serve in the armed forces.

An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last
 month found Obama leading Romney among Hispanic voters 61 percent to 27
 percent. But his administration's deportation policies have come under 
fire, and Latino leaders have raised the subject in private meetings 
with the president. In 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
deported a record 396,906 people and is expected to deport about 400,000
 this year.

Plan: Obama's policy is the same proposed by Senator Marco Rubio

A December poll by the Pew Hispanic 
Center showed that 59 percent of Latinos disapproved of the president's 
handling of deportations.

The
 changes come a year after the administration announced plans to focus 
on deporting serious criminals, immigrants who pose threats to public 
safety and national security, and serious immigration law violators.

One
 of the officials said the latest policy change is just another step in 
the administration's evolving approach to immigration.

Under
 the plan, immigrants whose deportation cases are pending in immigration
 court will have to prove their eligibility for a reprieve to ICE, which
 will begin dealing with such cases in 60 days. Any immigrant who 
already has a deportation order and those who never have been 
encountered by immigration authorities will deal with the U.S. 
Citizenship and Immigration Services.

The
 exact details of how the program will work, including how much 
immigrants will have to pay to apply and what proof they will need, 
still are being worked out.

In
 making it harder to deport, the Obama administration is in essence 
employing the same eligibility requirements spelled out in the proposed 
DREAM Act.

The 
administration officials stopped short of calling the change an 
administrative DREAM Act — the name is an acronym for Development, 
Relief and Education for Alien Minors — but the qualifications meet 
those laid out in a 2010 version that failed in the Senate after passing
 in the House. They said the DREAM Act, in some form, and comprehensive 
overhaul of the immigration system remained an administration priority.

Illegal
 immigrant children won't be eligible to apply for the deportation 
waiver until they turn 16, but the officials said younger children won't
 be deported either.

Last 
year, Napolitano announced plans to review about 300,000 pending 
deportation cases and indefinitely suspend those that didn't meet 
department priorities. So far, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has 
reviewed more than 232,000 cases and decided to stop working on about 
20,000. About 4,000 of those 20,000 have opted to keep fighting in court
 to stay in the United States legally. For the people who opted to close
 their cases, work permits are not guaranteed.
