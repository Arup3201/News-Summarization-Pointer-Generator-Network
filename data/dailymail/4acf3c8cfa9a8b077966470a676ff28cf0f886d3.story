UEFA have announced that they players will no longer miss the Champions League or Europa League final through suspension for the accumulation of yellow cards.

Players' booking will be wiped out after the quarter-final stages of European club competitions.

Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso was suspended for the Champions League final in May after picking up a third knockout phase booking in the second leg of his team's semi-final.

Missing: Paul Scholes and Roy Keane missed the 1999 Champions League final for Manchester United through suspension but players will no longer be banned for accumulating yellow cards throughout the tournament

Famously, Paul Scholes and Roy Keane missed Manchester United 1999 Champions League final victory over Bayern Munich due to an accumulation of yellow cards. 

In a statement, UEFA said: '(Our) emergency panel decided that, as of this season, all yellow cards from the beginning of the group stage will expire on completion of the quarterfinals. Bookings will therefore not be carried forward to the semi-finals.'

The rule is already in force in the international area during the European Championships.
