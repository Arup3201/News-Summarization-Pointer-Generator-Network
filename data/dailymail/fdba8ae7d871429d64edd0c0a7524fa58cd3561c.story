Former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said his children feel persecuted just as Jewish families did in Nazi Germany because he is being hounded by the country's magistrates who want to eliminate him politically.

Berlusconi's comments came from an advance excerpt of an interview with him by Italian television journalist Bruno Vespa for his latest book.

Asked about whether his five children had asked him to sell his media empire and leave Italy to escape his legal troubles, Berlusconi said: 'My children say that they feel like Jewish families in Germany under Hitler's regime. Truly, everyone is against us.'

Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler murdered an estimated six million Jews during World War Two.

Berlusconi, who protests his innocence in a series of court cases which he blames on left-wing magistrates, is well-known for making controversial remarks, such as calling President Barack Obama 'suntanned' after he was first elected in 2008.

During a heated 2003 exchange in the European Parliament, Berlusconi compared Martin Schulz, a German Social Democrat who is now president of the assembly, to a Nazi concentration camp guard.

Berlusconi, 77, and his family rank among the 200 wealthiest billionaires in the world, with an estimated fortune of 6.2 billion euros ($8.35 billion) according to Forbes magazine.

His conviction for tax fraud earlier this year poses a serious threat to his decades-long political career because it comes with a ban from public office, though polls show millions of Italians would still vote for him.

Berlusconi is also on trial on charges of having paid for sex with a minor and then abusing the powers of his office to have her released from jail after she was arrested for theft.

Berlusconi has threatened repeatedly to bring down Prime Minister Enrico Letta's broad left-right coalition government if the Senate votes on Nov. 27 to expel the media magnate from parliament.

With a litany of legal actions brought against him over the years, Silvio Berlusconi would be the first to tell you he’s had a rough time in the law courts.

But the former Italian premier has finally found a court that is on his side- a judge in Monza has cut his alimony payments in half - to a mere £1.2million a month.

He had previously been ordered to pay ex-wife Veronica Lario, whom he first met when he saw her topless on stage, a cool £2.5million a month.

The former actress had also wanted the
 £60million family villa but Mr Berlusconi, 77, whose personal fortune 
is estimated at £3.7billion, kept the villa near Milan as well as 
control of his business empire.

The
 playboy politician has complained bitterly about the payments which add
 up to £82,000 a day or £30million a year stating that the 'ridiculous 
settlement' was a scandal, decided by three 'feminist and communist' 
judges.

Miss Lario filed for divorce in 2009 after Berlusconi was photographed at an underwear model's 18th birthday party.

She said she could no longer stay with someone who spent time with 'minors' and pointed out that he had never turned up to any of his own children's 18th birthday parties.

Earlier in the year the billionaire had been forced to take out full-page adverts in the newspapers to apologise to her for telling a guest at a TV awards dinner that he wanted to marry her.

'If I wasn't married, I would marry you right away, ' he told showgirl turned politician Mara Carfagna. Berlusconi was married to Miss Lario for the best part of 20 years and has three children with her - Barbara, 29, Eleonora, 27, and Luigi, 25.

He was previously married to Carla Elvira Dell’Oglio with whom he had his first two children Marina, 47, and Pier Silvio, 44.

The controversial entrepreneur is now engaged to marry 28-year-old former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale.

Despite the legal victory, Berlusconi is still appealing two convictions, one for sex with an underage prostitute and one for illegally publishing police phone taps.
