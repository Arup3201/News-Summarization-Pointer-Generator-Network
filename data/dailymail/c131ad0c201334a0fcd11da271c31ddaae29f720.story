When it comes to Chandler Parsons new haircut, the inspiration wasn't a model in a magazine, a celebrity or a fellow sports star.

The 25-year-old Houston Rockets forward looked to his new friend, Patrick Hobbs-DeClaire.

After the Dallas game on Monday, he took out some clippers and shaved his head.

Patrick is a 10-year-old boy going through treatments for terminal cancer.

Off with your hair: Inspired by Patricks determination and fight in light of his battle with terminal cancer, Parsons decided to shave his head so the two would look similiar

The reveal: Parsons didn't tell Patrick he was going to shave his head, but told him to watch the game on ESPN on Christmas night

After meeting during a hospital visit last week, Parsons said he was inspired by Patrick's fight and determination, and returned for more visits.

'He is an unbelievable kid and the stuff he is going through really makes you realize how fortunate you are,' Parsons said.

Patrick is fighting Stage 4 Neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that attacks the autonomic nervous system.

'His dad was telling me how he isnâ€™t even scared of death,' Parsons said.

'He is more worried about not looking like his twin brother anymore, so me being his favorite player, I decided to shave my head to look more like him and hopefully give him some support and encouragement from me.

The 25-year-old put this photo on Twitter after the big chop. He said that, upon meeting Patrick, he was suffering back pain and a hangnail and that the magnitude of the 10-year-old's disease put life into perspective for him

'I was going through back spasms and had a hangnail on my toe and I went to see this 10-year-old fighting for his life so it really puts things in perspective.'

Parsons - who, as of 2012, earns $850,000 a year - said he didnâ€™t tell the young boy he was shaving his head, but let his family know to watch the Rockets play the Spurs on Christmas night.

'It will be a nice Christmas surprise for him,' Parsons said.

'He has a lot of support out there, from me and from the Rockets.'

Houston won the Christmas Night game against San Antonio 111-98.

Parsons has recently started dating Texan glamor model Robyn Crowley.
