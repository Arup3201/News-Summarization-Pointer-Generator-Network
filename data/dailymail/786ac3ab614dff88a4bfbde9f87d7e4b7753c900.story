A woman who was woken up by a truck crashing into her front yard was horrified after finding a dead man riddled with gunshot wounds inside. 

The homeowner inspected the vehicle through her bedroom window after it veered off the street towards her home in Houston, Texas, just before midnight on Thursday. 

After hearing the loud crash she then saw the man, believed to be in his 30s, slumped in the front seat of the gray Ford F-150 and called the police. 

Horrifying: A homeowner in Houston, Texas, woke up to find a track had crashed in her front yard. She then noticed a man who died from gunshot wounds slumped in front seat 

Authorities believe he was shot elsewhere and tried to drive through the neighborhood before collapsing and dying behind the wheel.

They insist it will be a challenge finding out what happened before the mysterious incident.

Steve Straughter from Houston Police's homicide unit told Click 2 Houston: 'It's going to be hard, because we've got to determine where this happened. 

'We've got to determine who [the man in the truck] is, and we also have to determine a motive. It's a big challenge.' 

They added that no shootings had been reported in the area, making it had to determine where the man was shot. 

Medical examiners have already recovered the body and the truck from the scene. 

Investigation: Authorities are now trying to determine where the victim, believed to be in his 30s, was shot
