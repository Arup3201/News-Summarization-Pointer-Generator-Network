An incredible finish produced two stoppage-time goals as Norwich came from behind for a second time to rescue a point.

No sooner had James Vaughan put Huddersfield 2-1 in front than Canaries substitute Jamar Loza plundered a point with almost the last kick.

Both goals came from close range. Vaughan was stupidly sent off after his, taking off his shirt in celebration to pick up a second yellow card within moments of each other.

Earlier, a goal disallowed after it had been awarded - and an amazing miss - beset Norwich in their top two challenge.

But they rallied to challenge strongly for all three at one stage.

Bradley Johnson was cautioned for handling the ball into the Huddersfield after referee Nigel Miller had signalled a goal from the Canaries first serious attack.

Late in the first half Gary Hooper somehow failed to make clean contact with the ball, let alone bury a sitter from six yards.

In between times, Norwich were stretched to stay on terms in a lively contest and eventually fell behind to Ishmael Miller after the break.

But substitute Wes Hoolahan slipped home from close range within five minutes of leaving the bench to round off a fine move triggered by Nathan Redmond.

The Johnson no-goal was a big talking point. He knocked the ball in almost on the line after Cameron Jerome had headed goalwards from Redmond's fine run and cross.

There was no flag from assistant referee Lisa Radhid but Miller was prompted to consult her amid strong Huddersfield protests.

The upshot was a booking for Johnson whose team mate Jerome was later lucky to escape at least a yellow for clattering over Tommy Smith.

James Vaughan, albeit a handful, failed with at least two chances to punish Norwich for whom keeper John Ruddy also denied Jacob Butterfield.

But Miller struck with a smart turn on the edge of the box to smash home with Ruddy caught out of position.

Jake Charles, 19 year old grandson of the great John Charles, was on the bench for Huddersfield in his first call up to the senior squad.

Chris Powell's team were fighting a rearguard action in the last 20 minutes as a more fluent Norwich found their rhythm.

The quick and clever Redmond was a constant source of danger down the right, forcing Town to substitute left back Jake Carroll.

Clearly manager Alex Neil was in no mood to settle for a point as Norwich looked to climb from fifth place.

Canaries appeals for a penalty were waved aside after Conor Coady was suspected of handling in the box.
