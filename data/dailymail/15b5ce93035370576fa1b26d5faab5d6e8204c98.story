Britain could be hit by a hike in food prices as large swathes of the world suffer from dry weather.

Farmers in Russia are being crippled by severe drought, which has caused a potentially devastating drop in the country's grain production.

Fears are mounting that the country, which exports the cheapest wheat, will impose an export ban, pushing up the price of food globally.

Russia is forecast to produce 75million tons of grain this year – a 30 per cent drop in the country’s usual yield.

Global wheat prices have already soared this summer after the worst drought in more than half a century hit Midwest America.

More
 than 60 per cent of the US is under moderate to exceptional drought, with some analysts saying the corn crop could be the smallest in a decade.

Russia last imposed a blanket ban on 
grain exports two years ago, in a move designed to keep 
domestic food prices under control.

The
 hard-line action, which resulted in a rise in bread prices, was prompted by the worst drought for the country in at least 50 
years.

Jack Watts, senior analyst at HGCA 
the Home-Grown Cereals Authority, said: ‘If there is a longer term 
period of higher prices then this may well end up with higher food 
prices.’

Speaking to Radio 4’s Farming Today programme today, he said: ‘Two years ago Russia had a blanket export ban in place very quickly.

‘In
 2012 the market is very fearful of this happening, there is no 
confirmation or real denial an export ban is going to happen, but the 
market is nervous based on a repeat of what we saw in 2010.’

The former Soviet Union is one of the world's biggest producers of wheat, barley and rye.

Mr
 Watts added: ‘With Russian being the cheapest exporter of wheat into 
key regions such as North Africa and Middle East, it almost make it a 
bit of a price setter.

‘So 
when we come into a season like this when exports are higher likely to 
be lower than where they were last season-the markets get a little bit 
nervous and tend to rise.

‘There
 is less competition for exports from the likes of the EU and US, so the
 world is essentially going to be more reliant on US wheat exports in 
the coming season.’

As the worst drought in more than half a century hit Midwest America, the price of corn surged by 20 per cent in July - the biggest two-month rally since the last major drought in 1988.

Lack
 of rain in America's breadbasket intensified at an unprecedented rate, 
driving concern food prices could soar even further if crops in the 
world's key producer are decimated.

Experts fear the US crisis, coupled with the problems in Russia, could cause further hikes in the price of grain.

Last year, Russia exported 28million 
tons of grain and the sheer volume of the country’s exports makes it a 
key player on the market.

But Russia's Volga Valley grain yields have already fallen by 50 per cent after a hot and dry spring.

Farmers in the drought-stricken province were used to 
shipping grain down the Volga River as far afield as Iran but this year's 
yields have halved, sending up local prices and prompting farms to hold 
onto grain in hope of further gains.

With a harvest of 700,000 tonnes this year, the region will 
be able to cover annual local demand of 300,000 tonnes with much less 
than usual to spare, Alexandr Chepukhin, agriculture minister of the 
Ulyanovsk region said.

Meanwhile in the US, nearly 220 counties in a dozen states have been added to the list of natural disaster areas as cash-strapped farmers and ranchers trying to grapple with the extreme heat and dryness.

The affected counties were designated primary disaster areas in the growing season, the vast majority of them mired in the drought.

In August 2010 Russia imposed a ban on grain imports after a severe drought and a spate of wildfires devastated crops.

Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said the move was necessary to protect his country’s population against wheat shortages.

The measures were designed to keep domestic food prices under control.

It was prompted by the worst drought in at least 50 years with a heat wave that included the highest temperatures recorded in 130 years.

This hit the grain harvest, with farmers harvesting 39.5m tons of grain - 22pc less than 2009.

Analysts at the time warned a loaf of bread in Britain could rise by as much as 15p as a result.

The US agriculture chief unveiled new help last week for farmers and ranchers  in counties in Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming.

Last week nearly half of the nation's corn crop was rated poor to very poor, according to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service.

That is the worst rating since the drought of 1988, which cut production by 20 per cent and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars.

About 37 per cent of the US soybeans were lumped into that category, while nearly three-quarters of U.S. cattle acreage were in drought-affected areas.

Yesterday Shenggen Fan, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute, an agricultural think tank warned drought in the U.S. farm belt may result in higher prices for poor people around the world.

He said the global spike in food prices in 2008 showed how poor crops and tight supplies have a wide impact.

The Agriculture Department was scheduled to make its first estimate of the fall harvest on Friday.

Some private analysts say the corn crop could be the smallest in a decade.
