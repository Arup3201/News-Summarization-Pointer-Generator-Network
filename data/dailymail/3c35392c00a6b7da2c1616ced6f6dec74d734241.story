A terror suspect who trained the ringleader of the 7/7 terrorist bombings in London has been allowed to set up an Islamic primary school, teaching children as young as three, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

As a member of a banned extremist group, Sajeel Shahid, 38, called for violence against British troops and ran a training camp in Pakistan where known terrorists learned how to make bombs and fire rocket- propelled grenades. 

One of his ‘graduates’ was Mohammed Siddique Khan, who led the gang of four suicide bombers on the deadliest terrorist attack ever committed in Britain, killing 52 people on the London Underground and a bus on July 7, 2005.

Shahid also allegedly trained four convicted terrorists who tried to blow up the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent and London’s  Ministry of Sound nightclub in a foiled plot. 

The jihadist – who was raised in Britain but spent years in Pakistan after the 9/11 attacks – was detained for three months in 2005 by the Pakistani security forces over his suspected links to Al Qaeda.

He had been running the Pakistan branch of the banned British extremist group Al-Muhajiroun. After his detention he was expelled from the country.

But despite being known to British security services, on his return to the UK he was given permission to set up an independent primary school, where he taught lessons and employed his brother – who also has a history of extremism – as head of IT.

The Department for Education said last night it was ‘urgently’ looking into Shahid’s case, which critics said exposed the lack of checks on potentially dangerous individuals who set up schools in the UK.

Lord Carlile, the Government’s former adviser on counter-terrorism, said: ‘It is a matter of real concern that somebody should be able to slip through the net and run a school where there has been substantial concern about his activities in the past.

'People who have been involved in terrorist activity anywhere in the world should not be allowed to run schools, unless there is the clearest evidence they have rejected the views that made them turn towards terrorism.’

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Committee which is investigating terrorism, including extremism in schools, said: ‘It’s extremely worrying a person with such a history, which should be of concern to the relevant authorities, should be in such a position. The DfE needs to look into this urgently.’

Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday show Shahid was registered as director and proprietor of the Ad-Deen Primary School in Ilford, Essex, which teaches 54 pupils aged three to 11. He is thought to have founded the £2,000-a-year school in 2009, where, using the pseudonym Abu Ibrahim, he taught children to recite the Koran.

He was able to operate his school for five years, despite the DfE launching a Due Diligence and Counter-Extremism Unit in 2010 to prevent individuals with a history of extremist beliefs running schools.

A cursory internet check on Shahid reveals his past as a terror suspect, as he even has a profile on Wikipedia stating his involvement with Al-Muhajiroun, the group founded by Omar Bakri Mohammed.

In 2001, Bakri sent Shahid and his elder brother Adeel, 39, also a member of Al-Muhajiroun, to Pakistan to set up a branch of the group there.

In December 2001, Shahid gave an interview to a British newspaper. He said: ‘We say the Pakistan army, navy and air-force should be fighting US and British forces which are killing our Islamic brothers and sisters in Afghanistan. We see the US and British governments as the biggest terrorists in the world.’

He also called on Muslims to rise up and ‘throw out their rulers implementing kufr [infidel] laws to be replaced by the Islamic law and order,’ adding, ‘jihad was the only solution for Muslim lands under occupation.’

More details of Shahid’s activities in
 Pakistan emerged at the Old Bailey trial of seven terrorists who 
plotted to blow up the Bluewater Centre and the Ministry of Sound with 
half a ton of fertiliser.

The
 court heard evidence from Muhammed Junaid Babar, 39, a US terrorist who
 became an FBI supergrass on Al Qaeda, who had met Shahid and his 
brother in Pakistan in 2001.

Babar
 revealed they accommodated British jihadists in safe houses in Lahore, 
before they left for Afghanistan to fight the Americans.

According
 to transcripts obtained by the MoS, Babar told the court that in 2003 
he and Shahid and two others travelled to a region near the Afghan 
border and set up a terrorist training camp in Malakand.

Babar
 told the jury that in August 2003, the would-be ringleader of the 7/7 
attacks, Mohammed Siddique Khan, 30, trained at the Malakand camp with 
Mohammed Shakil, 37, a friend from Leeds. He was jailed in 2009 for 
seven years for attending the camp.

Khan,
 who was known at the camp as Ibrahim, and Shakil, known as Zubair, were
 joined by four other Brits, who were led by Omar Khyam, 34, who was 
later convicted as the ringleader of the Bluewater plot.

In
 2005, the Shahid brothers were arrested by security forces in Pakistan 
on suspicion of supporting and having links with Al Qaeda and were 
detained for three months.

Security sources told The Mail on Sunday that Sajeel Shahid was ‘on MI5’s radar’ after he was expelled from Pakistan and returned to the UK, but slipped towards the bottom of their priority list as he was not deemed a national security threat. He has never been charged with any terrorism offences.

But last night, questions were asked as to how Shahid’s past was not uncovered by the DfE despite background vetting, which include enhanced criminal records checks. 

Electronic records sent to Companies House indicate that Shahid resigned from Ad-Deen early this month, although a staff member said that he ‘still goes in and out’ and can be reached at the school. He did not respond to our calls.

Ofsted inspected the school in 2011 and 2012 without apparently discovering Shahid’s past, concluding it met ‘all regulatory requirements’.

Last night, Ofsted refused to answer any questions on what checks it made on the background of Ad-Deen’s staff and proprietor.

The DfE spokesman said: ‘We will investigate any evidence put to us.’
