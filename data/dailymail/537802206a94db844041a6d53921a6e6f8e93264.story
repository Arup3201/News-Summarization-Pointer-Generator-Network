When 17-year-old Curt-Leigh Dixon stumbled across a mysterious dead body with spindly arms, a shrivelled head and giant teeth, he thought he'd found an alien corpse.

His 'groundbreaking' discovery sparked a frenzy of speculation online and in his hometown of Plettenberg Bay, South Africa, where villagers hailed it as proof extra-terrestrials live among us; others said it was, at the very least, a strange cross-breed between a seal and a monkey.

Either way, they knew it would make the town rich... until the local vet revealed it was a baby baboon.

You're taking the monkey: Some villagers hailed the find as proof extra-terrestrials live among us while others said it was, at the very least, a strange cross-breed between a seal and a monkey

Pictures of the strange beast taken by Curt-Leigh's father Llewellyn Dixon, a national park ranger, appeared to show a wrinkled and mummified beast unlike any on Earth.

The body was sent to local vet Dr Magdalena Braum who immediately scotched the discovery within seconds, saying: 'Anyone could see it was baby baboon.

'It was a newborn female baboon, with umbilical cord still attached to her body.

'It was most likely killed by the bite through her scull soon after birth, possibly infanticide, which is very common in some primate species when a new male takes over the troop.'

She said its strange shape and apparent mummification was down to the fact it had been carried around by its mother after death.

'We have seen it quite often in baboon research troops, when females carry the deceased infants sometimes for as long as three to four weeks on their tail section before finally discarding them,' Braum told Algoa FM.

It comes a month after a Chinese farmer was jailed for posing with an 'alien' that he claimed to have 
electrocuted after its UFO crash-landed on his farm but that he had really made from rubber.

The pictures of Mr Li standing next to the apparent extraterrestrial sparked a frenzy of speculation on social networking
sites across China.

Mr Li had claimed he saw a formation of UFOs buzzing across the night sky along the Yellow River in Binzhou Shangdong province.

But he has been forced to admit he made the whole thing up following five days in prison after police arrested him.

Despite originally sticking to his story that a craft plummeted to earth before Mr Li discovered the charred remains of an alien visitor in an electrified rabbit trap, he changed his mind following interrogation by police.

But he refused to admit the rubber doll was a fake - claiming he bought the 'body' from a villager and decided to keep it in his freezer.

However, when police discovered files on his computer that provided further evidence of the deception, Mr Li finally confessed.
