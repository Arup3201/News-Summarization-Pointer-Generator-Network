A triple amputee war hero, whose fight to walk again was featured in a TV documentary, is to quit the Army after complaining that a senior colleague had bullied him.

Paratrooper Corporal Tom Neathway, who lost both legs and an arm in a booby trap bomb in Afghanistan, became a symbol of courage when he starred in the BBC series Wounded.

After teaching himself to use artificial limbs, he skydived, carried a torch for the 2012 Olympic Games and participated in the Dakar car rally.

But in October 2011, Cpl Neathway, whose bravery has been praised by Prince Charles, launched an official complaint that a warrant officer had harassed him over his work and told him: ‘You’re not much of a paratrooper anymore.’

Cpl Neathway’s complaints of harassment were partially upheld in a November ruling.

But, having been suspended from his job at Brize Norton while the lengthy investigation took place, he was told he could not return to his clerical position at the Parachute Training Support Unit.

One friend said he had now told the Army that he intends to quit. ‘He is very upset with the way he has been treated over this. He has been demoralised and it has affected his health.’

An Army spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on individual serving soldiers.’
