Paul Bennett, 45, was spotted rubbing himself up and down on the postbox in a shopping centre

A man has admitted trying to having sex with a postbox after he was caught with his trousers round his ankles and shouting 'wow', a court heard.

Paul Bennett was spotted rubbing himself up and down on the pillar box in the Scholes Precinct shopping centre in Wigan, Greater Manchester, by a female passer-by who called the police.

The 45-year-old, who was drunk at the time, had been having an argument with a woman and after she walked away he lay down on a bench and started to shout.

His yelling caught the attention of the witness, who looked out her window and saw Bennett pulling down his trousers, exposing himself and performing a sex act.

He then moved over to the post box and rubbed himself up and down it with his trousers down, shouting 'wow', before pulling his pants up and checking his reflection in a window.

Katie Beattie, prosecuting, said: 'The victim was disgusted and alarmed by his behaviour. She rang the police.'

Bennett was found by police officers at the front of a shop in the precinct where he was still exposing himself and statement read to the prosecution described him as drunk.

The court heard Bennett became agitated and clenched his teeth as he shouted and swore at the officers. 

Defending Martin Jones said: 'The lady watched for sometime and was ashamed, disgusted and upset and my client accepts that. Clearly there are issues that need to be addressed.'

Bennett pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent exposure and using threatening and abusive words with abusive behaviour at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court. 

He was handed a 12-month community order with an alcohol treatment and supervision requirement.

He was also ordered to pay £50 compensation to the victim, £150 court costs and £60 victim surcharge and made to sign the Sex Offenders Register. 

Bennett admitted two charges of indecent exposure and was given a 12-month community order. We have decided to protect the identity of the postbox (pictured) in the Scholes Precinct shopping precinct in Wigan
