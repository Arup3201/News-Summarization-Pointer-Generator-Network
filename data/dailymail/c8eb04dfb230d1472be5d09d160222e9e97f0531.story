A 7th grade student has been kept out of class for two days because of her hair.

Neices Houston, of Lubbock, TX., has been banned from classes at Seagraves Junior High School because her mother bleached her hair as a reward for her getting good grades. School administrators insist her bleached her is against school dress code.

The dress code is enforced to prepare students for ‘the business world,’ the administrator told a local television station.

I earned it: Neices Houston said she earned her dyed hair through getting good grades

Despite being a straight-A student, Neices Houston has been banned from classes until she changes her hair back.

‘She gets up this morning, gets ready to go to school; she's not allowed to go to her class again,’ her mother told KCBD.

The honors student faces being placed in in-school suspension if her hair is not changed, the mother added.

‘Hair coloring or bleaching for the purpose of creating extreme differences in color,’ is deemed inappropriate grooming in the school’s student handbook, according to the station.

A school administrator defended removing the otherwise model student from class because of her hair.

‘Any color or bleach that creates two different colors that are extreme, opposite of the natural color, then that is violation of dress code,’ Superintendent Dr. Kevin Spiller told the station.

Despite the girl not being allowed in class and her mother telling KCBD her daughter has been threatened with in-school suspension, Mr Spiller told the station no disciplinary action had been taken – because of her hair.

Neices Houston refuted the uncompromising Mr Spiller’s claim.

‘You can't go to your normal classes until you get your hair changed and if you don't get it changed by a certain date then you're gonna be put in ISS,’ the upset girl told the station her principal said.

‘If it's still not changed by then, then we're either going to suspend you or go from there,’ Neices Houston further claimed she was told.

Mr Spiller also explained that students are normally given a timeline to resolve any violations, but both mother and daughter refuse to budge.

‘It's not hurting anybody but it's killing her not to be able to walk into a classroom and get her work done because in the long run she's gonna be behind…because of her hair?’ Watasha Houston asked.

‘I've waited two years to dye my hair and I've had to earn it by my grades,’ Neices Houston added.

Mail Online was unable to reach school administration for further comment.
