Nepalese tour guides killed when a blizzard struck a Himalayan trekking route were wearing trainers and even flip flops when they froze to death.

Few of the local workers, who earn as little as £9 a day as porters, had warm coats or boots to protect them from the freezing storm, said Captain Adhikari of the Nepalese Army.

At least 41 people were killed last week when a blizzard and avalanches swept the mountains of the Annapurna region in northern Nepal. Twenty were Nepalese guides, porters and villagers.

Some of the dead may not be found until the snows thaw next spring, authorities said.

Captain Adhikari, the Nepalese Army's top rescuer, led more than 70 hikers to safety after the storm - and personally recovered the bodies of 25.

He told Dean Nelson, who was in Jomsom, Nepal, for the Daily Telegraph: 'The worst thing was [seeing] the equipment and gear of the Nepali porters and guides because it meant they were dead, but they were not well-equipped.

'The Nepalis I saw were wearing normal dress, some of them in slippers, some had coats and some didn’t. They did not have proper clothes or protection from the snow...this could be a factor in why so many Nepalis died.'

Baburam Bhandari, the Nepal government’s chief district officer in charge of the rescue effort, echoed his comments. 'Porters had no trekking shoes or coats,' he said.

'They were in sports shoes and normal clothes because they’re poor - it is one of the causes of their deaths. Some of them died because they were too cold - it was freezing snow, five or six feet deep'

Today Nepalese officials said they will introduce new rules to try to make sure the disaster will not be repeated. Tourism Department official Tulasi Gautam said trekkers venturing to mountain trails will be required to take trained local guides, and will have to rent a GPS tracking unit to help authorities trace them in case of an emergency.

Mr Gautam said the government plans to announce the new rules nationwide before the next trekking season in the spring.

'The main reason for the high number of casualties is that those trekkers without proper guides were prompted to continue with their trek in attempts to beat the storm. So we plan to strictly enforce new rules of no trekking without porters or proper guides,' Mr Gautam said.

Many of the trekkers around the Annapurna Circuit trekking route are independent hikers generally called backpackers who do not hire guides. The route is also dotted with lodges and tea stalls that sell food, snacks and lodging.

Authorities also plan to improve the weather forecasting system and make it easier to deliver information to remote trekking routes.

The government also said all trekkers must now register at check posts while entering and exiting the trekking areas. Previously, foreign trekkers were required to buy permits or at least register before entering trekking areas, but Nepalese nationals were not. And no one was required to check out when they left.

Home Ministry Secretary Surya Prasad Silwal said rescuers were able to fly 518 stranded trekkers, including 310 foreigners, to safety before the search operation ended Monday.

'It was the biggest rescue operation in Nepal that included hundreds of soldiers, policemen and local officials. Swift response saved many lives,' Silwal said. He added that every available helicopter was used in the effort.
