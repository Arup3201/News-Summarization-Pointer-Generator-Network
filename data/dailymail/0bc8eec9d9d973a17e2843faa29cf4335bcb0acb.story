Intrepid traveler: James Asquith has become the youngest person to visit every country in the world

A British traveller has become the youngest person to visit every country in the world.

James Asquith spent a whopping £125,000 to achieve his dream.

Over the course of five years the 24-year-old, who now works as banker in London, managed to visit all 196 countries from Australia to Iraq and San Marino to Serbia.

He started travelling in 2008 after his best friends caught the travel bug and decided to pack his bags and see what the fuss was about.

Mr Asquith, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, said: 'Vietnam was the first independent country I went to and I spent nearly three months there.

'I also spent about five months in the US and Canada, getting to 27 states from Hawaii to Alaska.'

Spending his university holidays in far-flung destinations, Mr Asquith funded his travels through part-time jobs he's had since the age of 16.

He also picked up work along the way in bars and hostels.

It was only when he arrived in war-torn Egypt he realised he wanted to visit every country on the planet, including the unstable nations.

He added: 'I loved the adrenaline that 
went with it - but I always seemed to pick the worst timing to visit a 
lot of the countries.

'I went to Libya three weeks after 
Gaddafi fell, Afghanistan two weeks after the terrorist bombings in 
Mazar-i-Sharif, but generally I just found a local and tried to get an 
insight into each country.

'I spent most of my time in Libya with a local man showing me all the war damage, and in Iran I met the hotel owner's son who was my age who gave me a great local insight.

'The longest I spent anywhere was six
 months in Africa. I travelled overland from Senegal to the Congo and 
then over back up through the east.

'There
 were lots of small countries and tricky border crossings, putting trust
 in some people that drove me as much as three countries a time.

'But
 I haven't finished yet - I'm excited about Tahiti, Easter island, and 
Antarctica all of which I am hoping to go to next year.'
