Bolton will wear their 'military green' third kit, produced to aid injured soldiers, in their next match against Blackpool.

The Wanderers' strip, 1,000 of which have been made with part of the proceeds going to Blesma, the limbless veterans charity, will be sported by their players at Bloomfield Road on November 22.

The shirt, brought out to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the start of World War One, has the words ‘Lest We Forget’ embossed on the reverse and features an embroidered club crest.

Blesma, The Limbless Veterans is a national charity that supports servicemen and women who have lost limbs and the use of limbs or the loss of eyesight in military service.

The words from Laurence Binyon’s poem For the Fallen are inside the neck label. The shirt is on sale, with £10 going to the charity.

Bolton have already raised £10,000 for Blesma and they were presented with a cheque at the game against Cardiff at the Macron Stadium.

Bolton historically have a big link with the military.

The 'Wartime Wanderers', as they became known, were the first football team to sign up for the Second World War in 1939, when captain Harry Goslin addressed the crowd on the Burnden Park pitch and then marched his players to the nearest recruitment office.

Goslin, a sergeant in the 53rd (Bolton) Field Regiment, did not see out the end of the war. He died after a bomb exploded in Italy in 1943.
