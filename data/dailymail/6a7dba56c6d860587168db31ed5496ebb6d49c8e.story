In the Christmas battle of the next-generation games consoles, there already appears to a clear winner.

Sony’s PlayStation 4 has not only became the fastest selling console in UK history - selling a quarter of a million consoles in just 48 hours - it sold 100,000 more than rival Microsoft’s Xbox One in its opening weekend in the UK.

The sales numbers are not official and they have been compiled from retail sales across the country by market tracking firm GfK, although this means the figure could be even higher.

Figures from market tracker GfK claim Sony sold 250,000 consoles over the weekend. This beat the previous UK console sales record of 185,000 for the PlayStation Portable which launched in 2005. Sony also broke the record in the U.S. after it sold around a million consoles in the two days after launch last month

Hundreds of gamers camped for hours, 
and in some cases days, to be the first to get their hands on the 
fourth-generation console as shops across the UK opened at midnight on 
Thursday.

U.S. customers got the console 
two weeks earlier and the launch was just a week after rival Microsoft
 started selling its Xbox One.

The PS4 is the first major game machine the Japanese firm has built since the PlayStation 3 in 2006.

It comes with 8GB
 of DDR3 RAM powered by a custom 8-core AMD CPU plus a 500GB hard drive.
 The console also has the Blu-ray drive seen in its previous, 
third-generation model.

The
 new version of its DualShock controller includes a 'share' button that 
allows players to post gameplay footage and screenshots online. 

It has a two-point touchpad 
and six-axis Move motion sensor that works with a 3D camera placed near 
the TV set. Other features include a Light Bar, Vibration and a built-in
 mono speaker.

By comparison, Microsoft's Xbox One sold 150,000 in the UK during its launch weekend. Globally, however, it sold over a million within the first 24 hours, surpassing the sales figures of its previous Xbox 360 console

Friday's launch signalled the official start of the 
pre-Christmas console battle, yet many gamers could
 end up disappointed as retailers warned of low stocks. Other retailers sold out
 of pre-orders weeks ago.

Before the U.S. launch on November 15,
 London's OXO Tower was given a makeover with the iconic letters from 
the company's name transformed to look like the buttons from Sony's 
DualShock controller.

A PS4 lounge was also set up on the 
same day in Covent Garden so fans could play upcoming games before their
 official release.

Microsoft was the first to announce 
it would be releasing its next-generation console in time for Christmas 
during an unveiling at the Microsoft's Washington headquarters in May.

It
 costs $499 in the U.S. and £429 in the UK, making it £80 more expensive
 than Sony's model.Sony first gave a sneak preview of the PS4 a month 
later, in June.

Following its global launch on 15 November, Microsoft sold more than one million Xbox One consoles, surpassing first-day sales of the Xbox 360, the previous-generation model that went on sale eight years ago.

The new console was launched in 13 countries and the software giant said it sold had out almost immediately at most retailers.

Bookmakers Paddy Power slashed the odds on PlayStation 4 outselling the Xbox One in 2013 following the unveiling.

It chopped the odds on the 
PlayStation 4 being the top selling console in 2013 from 4/11 to 2/9 
while the Xbox One’s odds drifted from 15/8 to 11/4.

Similarly, IHS
 has predicted Sony will sell 2.4 million PS4 consoles by the end of 
2013, with Microsoft managing a similar amount of 2.2 million Xbox One 
consoles.

IHS expects 
existing geographical brand allegiance to continue with Xbox One 
outselling PS4 in North America, and PS4 outselling Xbox One across 
Europe combined.

Over 
the next five years, IHS predicts that Sony will sell 49 million 
consoles, while Microsoft will fall short by around 11 million.

Both companies are also expected to 
benefit from Nintendo's Wii U weak sales, with some past Wii users 
adopting the latest consoles instead of upgrading to Wii U.

According
 to media monitoring firm, Synthesio, there were 40 per cent more 
comments for the PS4 compared to the Xbox One across social networks. The comments were also 
three times more positive.

Just
 under half of comments about the latest Xbox cited 'issues', such as 
faulty hardware or problems with TV connections, but consumers have been 
impressed by the hand gesture and voice recognition functionality.

The most talked about issue in 
relation to the PS4 was the need to buy a separate camera, however fans 
did not appear to have been put off by the additional cost, with only 5 
per cent citing it as a negative.

Other main talking points included the PS4's graphics, competitive price and social features.

Catriona
 Oldershaw, Managing Director UK of Synthesio, said: 'Although the PS4 
has only just had its European launch, there is still a markedly higher 
level of online buzz compared to the Xbox.

'The
 Xbox One has received criticism in some quarters due to hardware 
glitches, however, consumers are still very positive about the hand 
gesture and voice recognition upgrades.

'If
 the Xbox hadn't experienced teething problems, we would have expected 
the proportion of positive comments to rival the PS4. However, it is 
clear that the PS4 has a much more vocal online consumer base. The 
question is whether these online advocates help to drive sales.'
