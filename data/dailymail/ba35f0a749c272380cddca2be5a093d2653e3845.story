Cult leader Warren Jeffs has spent the past six years behind bars after being arrested and later convicted of sexual abuse of young girls, but that has not stopped him from continuing to exude complete control over his polygamous community.

A Friday expose on ABC’s 20/20 has revealed the insulated world of The Fundamentalist Latter-Day Saints Church where Jeffs’ 8,000 followers continue to believe that he is a prophet and God who has been wrongly imprisoned.

‘Anybody who thinks that Warren Jeffs' incarceration ended his rule in this community has no idea what they're talking about,’ said reporter Mike Watkiss.

‘He is in many ways more powerful because now he's martyred.’

Innocent victims: Children living in Warren Jeffs' compound are taught that the self-proclaimed prophet convicted of child sex abuse is the U.S. president

A 2008 raid on Jeffs' FLDS stronghold in 
Eldorado, Texas, revealed the polygamous community which included 
pregnant child brides in pastel prairie dresses with elaborate braided 
hairdos. 

The FLDS holds polygamy as a fundamental belief and its men take multiple wives in what are termed 'celestial marriages' each performed in a ceremony called a 'sealing'.

The Utah-based church believes polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and arranged marriages  sometimes involve underage girls.

More than a year after his conviction of 
child sex abuse, it appears that little has changed in the remote 
Yearning for Zion compound in Colorado City housing the Fundamentalist 
Latter Day Saints, a radical wing of the Mormon Church.

Religious studies: Children in the local schoolhouse are taught Jeffs' proverbs in place of science or history

Oppressed: In the male-dominated community, the women live in polygamous marriages where each man has at least three sister wives

Styling tips: Fundamentalist Latter Day Saint women are not allowed to cut their hair because it is believed that they will need it to wash men's feet in heaven

Like in the past, Jeffs decides where people live, whom they marry and even what they eat and how they dress.

Children of cult members receive little 
more than a grade school education where science and history are ignored
 in favour of religious studies with an emphasis on Jeffs’ proverbs, and
 where every school book must be personally approved by the leader.

Totalitarian leader: Jeffs was convicted last year of molesting two teenage girls and sentenced to life in prison, but he continues to have control over his sect

One proverb reads: 'When you disobey there must and will always be a punishment.'

Children in the local schoolhouse are also taught that Jeffs was the president of the United States and that God led Neil Armstrong away from the moon during the Apollo 11.

When questioned by an ABC reporter about 
their general level of knowledge, a trio of girls who escaped the cult 
several months earlier along with their mother said that they had never 
heard of Ronald Reagan, Santa Claus or AIDS.

The women are always covered from neck to ankle because they believe their bodies are sacred.

Town dressmaker Lizzie Jeffs said: 'We believe in being modest.

'The Lord teaches us that if we can dress properly, it is easier to see each other as a whole person inside and out.'

Women must never cut their hair because it is believed that they will need it to wash men's feet in heaven.

They all live in polygamous marriages where each man has at least three sister wives.

The FLDS organization is protected by Utah’s homeschooling law, which means that state officials have no say about the content of the curriculum taught on the grounds of the secured compound.

In August 2011, Jeffs, 56, was found guilty of molesting two girls ages 12 and 15 whom he took as brides in 'spiritual marriages’.

Handpicked fathers: FLDS children bath in a river in their clothes for modesty in the cult where 15 men have been handpicked by Jeffs to father all the children. Married couples are banned from having sex

Banished: Jeffs ordered 500-600 men and women expelled from FLDS, among them Carling Steed (pictured with third wife Suzette)

Modesty is sacred: The women are always covered from neck to ankle because they believe their bodies are sacred. Town dressmaker Lizzie Jeffs (pictured) said the dresses 'make it easier to see each other as a whole person inside and out'

Apostates: Carling Steed's third wife, Suzette, second left, and their six daughters, left the community and the church in search of a normal life

Grim prediction: FLDS apostate Willie Steed said that as long as Jeffs lives, his community will remain loyal to him

Eleven other FLDS men were charged with 
crimes including sexual assault and bigamy. So far, all seven, who have 
been prosecuted, have been convicted - receiving prison sentences of 
between six and 75 years.

In recent months, it appears that the 
all-powerful self-proclaimed prophet has begun unraveling, issuing ever 
more bizarre edicts to the members of his community such as a ban on 
children’s toys and the consumption of corn.

More importantly, Jeffs has ordered married couples in his community to stop having sex or even touching one another.

Instead, he selected 15 men from among his trusted followers to father all the future FLDS children.

Now, if a woman wants to have a baby, she has to approach one of the men handpicked for the task by Jeffs. The sexual act must be witnessed by two other men from the group.

In a tragic twist, the jailed cult leader ordered that 500-600 men and women be banished without any explanation from the compound, which for many of them had been the only home they had ever known.

The effect of this decree issued from behind bars has been devastating to many families that were torn apart.

So absolute is Jeffs’ control over his flock that those members who were ordered to leave, severed all ties with their loved ones still living on the compound for fear of retribution.   

Willie Steed, 18, who left the group along with his mother, Suzette, and six sisters after their father Carling was banished, said that as long as Jeffs is alive, his spell over the insular community of Colorado City will not be broken.

‘He is their idol, and they worship him,’ he said.
