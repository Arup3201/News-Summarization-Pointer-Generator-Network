An aide to congresswoman Michele Bachmann was caught on hidden camera stealing from her chief of staff.

Javier Sanchez, 37, of Virginia, was arrested Thursday and charged with theft after a sting set up by U.S. Capitol Police caught him stealing envelopes of cash out of her chief of staff's desk.

Formerly a senior legislative assistant to Bachmann (R-MN), Sanchez is no longer a member of her staff, according to reports.

Sanchez was caught on hidden camera by U.S. Capitol Police stealing two separate envelopes from a desk in her chief of staff's office. One envelope was marked '$80 petty cash' and the other '$120 birthday money,' according to NBC Washington. The thefts took place in the Rayburn office building.

The former aide was arrested July 11 after investigators set up the sting in response to a string of thefts in the building, Fox News reported.

A prominent member of the tea party movement, Bachmann recently announced she will not seek re-election to the House. The outgoing congresswoman also ran an unsuccessful, but divisive and eventful, bid for the Republican nomination during the 2012 presidential election.

In a May YouTube video announcing her leave from Congress Bachmann compared her exit to that of a two term president, saying 'the law limits anyone from serving as president of the United States for more than eight years, and in my opinion, well, eight years is also long enough for an individual to serve as a representative for a specific Congressional district.'

Sanchez was charged with second degree misdemeanor theft and released on his own personal recognizance. He is due in court August 26 for a hearing, according to officials.

Still being investigated, a series of thefts in the building last year have not yet been linked to Sanchez, NBC Washington reported.
