Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today defended the NHS reforms, amid reports senior Tories fear it is the biggest strategic mistake they have made in government

Ministers were today forced to defend the controversial overhaul of the NHS amid claims senior Tories believe it is the biggest mistake they have made in government.

Insiders described the reforms as ‘unintelligible gobbledygook’ which had been a ‘huge strategic error’ for the Conservative’s reputation for looking after the health service.

As health workers went on strike over pay, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today insisted the changes had been ‘very, very important’ in saving money which could be used to hire more doctors and nurses.

In opposition, the Tories promised there would be no top-down reorganisation of the NHS.

The controversial shake-up, which was not included in either Coalition party’s manifesto, was drawn up by Andrew Lansley, when he was the health secretary.

One senior cabinet minister told The Times: ‘We’ve made three mistakes that I regret, the first being restructuring the NHS. The rest are minor.’

One ally of Mr Osborne, the Chancellor, said: ‘George kicks himself for not having spotted it and stopped it. He had the opportunity then and he didn’t take it.’

A former No 10 adviser said: ‘No one apart from Lansley had a clue what he was really embarking on, certainly not the prime minister.

‘He kept saying his grand plans had the backing of the medical establishment and we trusted him. In retrospect it was a mistake.’

The legislation was so badly written that it was amended some 2,000 times as it went through Parliament, with even supporters of the original plans saying the final outcome bore little relation to Mr Lansley’s vision.

The Health and Social Care Bill scrapped primary care trusts and put billions in spending in the hands of GP commissioning groups.

It was originally claimed it would save £7.7billion, but it was later downgraded to £6billion.

Critics have complained that managers given pay-offs after health bodies were axed were quickly rehired by new NHS groups.

An investigation by The Times found that a study carried out for ministers has found that at least £5billion is wasted every year on inefficiencies, such as overpaying for supplies, out-of-date drugs, agency workers and empty buildings.

Two fifths of NHS chief executives told the paper that charges to see a GP or stay in hospital will be needed without extra money for the health service.

Members of the armed forces today stepped in as more than 400,000 NHS staff staged their first walk out in more than 30 years, mounting picket lines outside hospitals.

But it emerged only a fraction of workers who belong to unions taking part, voted to strike in the row over pay.

Fewer than half those balloted for the controversial health strike voted in favour of the action, the Daily Mail can reveal.

And Unison, one of the biggest unions, could persuade fewer than one in ten – 9.5 per cent – of eligible members to vote for the controversial walkout.

None of the other six trade organisations involved managed to get a mandate from more than half of those balloted.

Yet 400,000 nurses, midwives, paramedics, specialist health staff and hospital porters and cleaners staged the walk out from 7am for four hours

The Times also found that ‘trolley waits’ to get into hospital from A&E are running at almost three times the level of 2011 and the cost of bed blockers is at a record high.

Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Let’s look at those reforms because they are very, very important.

‘What we are dealing with is an aging population, with cancer survival rates that we are trying to increase, with wanting to get better care for dementia… is a lot of pressure on the NHS which we need more staff for.

‘And what those reforms did, was we abolished the Primary Care Trust, the Strategic Health Authorities employed 19,00 people and we have put that money into the frontline. So, the NHS today has 7,000 more doctors, 3,500 more nurses overall than we had four years ago. Those are net savings.

“We have saved actually as a result of those reforms over a billion pounds a year net, including the costs of redundancy, including the cost of the transition, all that. And as a result of saving that billion pounds a year we have more doctors, more nurses on our front lines, shorter waiting times than we would otherwise have had.’

Simon Stevens, head of the NHS, said that the health service needed more radical change to cope with a lack of cash.

‘Recent methods of balancing the books are not going to be indefinitely repeatable,’ he said.

Clare Gerada, who led the fight against the reforms as chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, called the admission disgraceful. She said: ‘I think politicians and policymakers need to have a long, hard look at themselves.

‘They are saying this now but they should have said it then. The big issue is that nobody has been held accountable for it. If Mr Lansley was a doctor, he would have been referred to the General Medical Council.’
