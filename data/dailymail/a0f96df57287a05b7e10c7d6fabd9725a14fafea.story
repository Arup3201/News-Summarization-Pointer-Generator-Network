David Gregory has been fired as moderator of the venerable NBC interview show 'Meet the Press' after years of slumping ratings that saw the program falls behind rivals ABC and CBS.

The network announced that chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd will replace him a host on September 7.

Shortly before NBC made the change public, Gregory took to Twitter to announce he was leaving the network: 'I leave NBC as I came - humbled and grateful. I love journalism and serving as moderator of MTP was the highest honor there is.

'I have great respect for my colleagues at NBC News and wish them all well. To the viewers, I say thank you.'

Resignation: David Gregory told his 1.7million followers that he was leaving NBC. His resignation came before network executives could announce he was being replaced

A memo from NBC News President Deborah Turness praised Gregory's 'remarkable gift for holding leaders to account,' but several news sources report that he was forced out. He has led the the Sunday program since the death of Tim Russert six years ago.

According to CNN's Brian Stelter, he was not even allowed to host a final show before his dismissal.  Stelter reports that Gregory is currently vacationing in New Hampshire with his wife.

Todd currently has his own morning show on MSNBC, 'The Daily Rundown,' which airs weekdays at 9am. 

Ratings for 'Meet the Press' have been slumping for years. Last year, they hit 2.9million - the lowest level in 21 years as the show fell to third behind ABC rival 'This Week' and CBS' 'Face the Nation.' 

And ratings have continued to nose-dive.TV Newser reports that on August 3, just 2.1million people tuned in - and only 584,000 from the vital 25-54 age demographic.

Earlier this week, Politico reported that NBC had anointed Todd as its new 'Meet the Press' moderator.  

'The move is an effort by NBC News President Deborah Turness to restore passion and insider cred to a network treasure that has been adrift since the death in 2008 of the irreplaceable Tim Russert,' Politico's Mike Allen said. 

The white-haired Gregory was a rising star at NBC when he was appointed replace Russert - whose sudden death was widely mourned by the political establishment. 

Media watcher say NBC hopes Chuck Todd's sources and his 'political junkie' enthusiasm will draw viewers back in to the show, which is known for its long, in-depth interviews with politicians and other newsmakers. 

Todd, 42, grew up in Miami and is a devoted University of Miami Hurricanes fan. He attended George Washington University in Washington, DC. - first majoring in music, then in political science - but never graduated. 

He has served as NBC's chief White House Correspondent since 2008.

Politico reports that he has since developed a devoted following of  politicians, policymakers and other Washington insiders.

'Meet the Press' is one of NBC's marquee programs. On the air since November 6, 1947, it has the distinction of being the longest-running show on TV. Gregory is the 11th moderator of the show.
