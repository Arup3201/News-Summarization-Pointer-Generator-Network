'For me, Chelsea's best player is Branislav Ivanovic. He's the best defender in Europe. I don't understand why nobody talks about him. It’s strange because I think he’s complete. He’s got everything. He's very strong, he’s got a good jump, he's fast and he's got good technique. He's a warrior.' It's fair to say Robert Pires isn't a bad judge.

The former Arsenal and France international has won a thing or two but it is never easy to pour such glowing praise on your old enemy.

As he proved at the Parc des Princes again on Tuesday night though, Ivanovic is a player every man on the street would like on his team.

Branislav Ivanovic has scored seven goals in the Champions League since 2009, more than any other defender. 

He has netted 30 times in all competitions since joining Chelsea in 2008.

He is a throwback to the defenders of old, ruthless, uncompromising, takes no prisoners, leaves no-one behind; he is a leader of men and, for Chelsea, so often their saviour.

His blood-stained right boot worn in the bruising Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool is primed for Chelsea's academy. It is an example to aspiring players of what really matters in sport.

It's not money, not flash watches but the commitment, dedication and pain it takes to get to the very top.

The other white, relatively unblemished Nike boot is to be framed and mounted in Ivanovic's Surrey home - but only if Chelsea win the Capital One Cup.

At half-time against Liverpool, Ivanovic limped back to dressing room, poured the blood out of his boot and asked to be cleaned up. A bullet-hole wound caused by a stud on the bridge of his foot was plugged, strapped and Ivanovic asked for an injection.

'It was really painful during the game, a lot of swelling, like any wound, but it’s all right. It’s just a wound, it’s open. I didn’t have stitches because they didn’t want to close the wound because of the inflammation.' That's OK, then.

Days later when Jose Mourinho surveyed the walking wounded he was selecting to face champions Manchester City his eyes focused on the burly defender he holds in such esteem limping into the dressing room. 'Are you ok Bane?' he asked. 'Don't worry about me. Just look after the others,' came the reply. Mourinho didn't expect anything else.

Manchester City marked a milestone for Ivanovic as a Chelsea player. He needed the aid of an injection but there was no way he was missing this, his 300th game.

Not one for too many mementos, Ivanovic kept the boots and shirt from that game to frame. Sadly, opportunist thieves stole them from his car later that night.

He still didn't make a fuss, even though it has taken a lot of hard work to make it this far. The early days were ones of despair when Avram Grant barely played him.

Often he battled to impress his new club. Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic recalled getting caught in a fight with his compatriot during a typically combative United-Chelsea encounter. 

'I said: ''what are you doing? We are Serbs.'' Ivanovic said: ''Even if you were family I would fight you, I want to win''.'

As Ivanovic says: 'You need to motivate yourself. To go over the limit. Even if you don’t think someone is against you, you have to find motivation. It is important in winning matches to find extra motivation inside yourself. Sometimes we need to feel this extra pressure.'

Everton's James McCarthy may beg to differ after his throttling at the hands of Ivanovic, but that quality makes him a coach's dream.

Mourinho wanted Ivanovic when he went to Real Madrid. Monaco and Barcelona enquired and Paris Saint-Germain would still like to sign him now. Surprisingly, he has just 18 months left on contract and the fact he has turned 30 is Chelsea's excuse for, so far, postponing discussions over a new deal.

For Ivanovic, it's not about the money. It's about respect. Raheem Sterling said he is the scariest player he has faced, 'a human tank.'

His good friend, tennis star Novak Djokovic talks of a mutual admiration. Luis Suarez was grateful he didn't tell all about his infamous bite.

'Bane' shuns club attempts to get him on Facebook and Twitter. He turns down lucrative commercial deals because he simply doesn't see a need to take money for a product he doesn't like.

He drives the same Q7 Audi he bought when he joined Chelsea seven years ago. It's practical for taking his family around town.

An intensely private man, he enjoys nothing better than a family day with wife and childhood sweetheart Natasa, son Stefan and twins Andreja and Ana.

He doesn't wear a watch, the Rolex presented for being part of Chelsea's Champions League winning side gets an occasional dusting.

Parties and fashion are not his forte as his team-mates often jest - but he is still the man they turn to for advice. Ivanovic is on the Chelsea players' committee where senior figures help the younger ones with problems and liaise with management.

It's a compassionate and understanding side that many a trainee appreciates and he puts it to further use as the patron of 'Ballboys' a charity that fights the fight against testicular cancer. Newcastle's Jonas Gutierrez has been grateful for his support.

'A competitive animal, a big heart,' was how Jose Mourinho described him. Understated, yes, but that's just how Branislav Ivanovic likes to play it.
