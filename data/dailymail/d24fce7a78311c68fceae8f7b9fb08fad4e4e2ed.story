Trees were uprooted, cars were crushed and streets were flooded as wild weather battered NSW and Victoria overnight.

State Emergency Service volunteers in both states responded to hundreds of calls from residents reporting fallen trees while one homeowner in Kurnell, in Sydney's south, had their roof blown off as winds reached 98km/h.

And the dangerous conditions are not over yet, with officials in NSW warning people to stay inside as wind gusts are expected to peak at 110km/h on Sunday afternoon. A NSW SES spokeswoman says winds are started to pick up at about 11am.

Most calls for help in NSW involved fallen trees on Saturday

The SES received 500 calls for help on Saturday night into Sunday morning, mostly from the Sydney and Illawarra areas. In Victoria, they responded to 400 call outs.

'NSW SES teams have had another busy night,' a NSW SES spokeswoman said.

'About 300 of the jobs have been for trees down.'

The blustery conditions are being caused by a cold front moving across NSW which also dumped snow on the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.

In Liverpool, in Sydney's south-west, a tree fell on an ambulance station on Saturday afternoon, destroying five cars and an ambulance.

In Victoria, the worst affected areas included Portland, west of Melbourne.

During a lull on Sunday morning, the SES advised people to prepare their properties and to secure or stow any items that could become projectiles.

Strong winds are forecast for the Illawarra, Central Tablelands, Hunter, Southern Tablelands and the Snowy Mountains on Sunday afternoon, although Sydney has been taken off the Bureau of Meteorology severe weather warning.

The BOM predicts top wind gusts for the state of 104km/h at Nowra, 109km/h at Thredbo and 93km/h in Moss Vale in the southern highlands.

Authorities are warning more wild weather is on the way in the coming days

Sydney can expect winds of 60km/h later on Sunday, with gusts up to 90-110km/h. A BOM spokeswoman said they will ease at about 6pm.

'It's a day to stay indoors,' said SES spokeswoman Becky Gollings.

'When it's not too windy, have a look around the yard and tie down garden furniture and trampolines, and park cars under cover,' she said.

'It's not the day for sightseeing.'
