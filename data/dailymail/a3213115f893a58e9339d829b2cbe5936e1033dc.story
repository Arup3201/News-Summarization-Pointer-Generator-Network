An Australian teenager has been arrested after he tweeted a bomb threat to American popstar Pink as she performed a concert.

Shortly before the singer was due on stage for her Melbourne show, the unnamed 16-year-old posted: '@Pink I'm ready with my Bomb. Time to blow up #RodLaverArena. B****.'

Security spotted the tweet because the teenager used the Rod Laver Arena hashtag and managed to identify him in the 12,000-strong crowd thanks to his profile photo on the social networking site.

High alert: Pink was about to go on stage for her 'Truth About Love' tour in Melbourne when a fan in the audience sparked a security alert by tweeting that he was 'ready with my bomb'

In trouble now: The tweet the 16-year-old boy posted while at Road Laver Arena in Melbourne shortly before Pink was due on stage to perform

He was escorted out of the venue and held by police for three hours until his parents could drive to the venue from their home in Warrnambool, 165 miles away, and take him home.

The youngster, who had been at the concert with two friends, is now expected to be charged with uttering threats and causing a public nuisance when he appears in court later this week.

His Twitter profile has also been deleted.

The drama happened on Sunday night - the first of Pink's record-breaking run of 18 shows in Melbourne as part of her The Truth About Love world tour.

The boy's father, named as David King, told a Melbourne radio station that security at the venue overreacted.

'When he wrote that, he didn't have time to put "Timebomb",' he said. 'The policeman said to me, "If it was up to me, I would have booted him in the backside and said go home". But they demanded he be arrested.'

The boy's sister has also defended his actions, telling Australian media he was a 'grade-A student' and that he sent the tweet after the concert was delayed by an hour.

She said he also meant the message to refer to Pink's song, Timebomb, and not an actual bomb.

She said: 'He wrote it as in one of her songs is called Timebomb and he forgot to put the Time on there.

'We are a decent family and we don't have bombs and stuff like that. We're not terrorists and we don't want people to think that.

'Boys will be boys. It wasn't an issue that they had a bomb, it wasn't a prank or anything like that.

'He told us he was referring to lyrics in a song and it was just a "check-in" sort of thing.'

Charged: The teenager was escorted out of the concert and is expected to appear in court later this week over the incident

Describing what happened after he sent the tweet, she said security guards approached her brother inside the venue, showed him his Twitter profile pic and asked if it was him.

'Then seven people just jumped on him. It was just so violent,' she said. 'They pulled him, they threw him on the ground and locked him up.

'He's not a trouble maker. He's a grade-A student.

'We don't think it should be going to court because of the way they handled him.'

A police spokesman said: 'We can confirm we were called to the Rod Laver Arena at about 8.30pm on Sunday in relation to a bomb threat.

'A 16-year-old boy from Warrnambool has been interviewed and is expected to be charged on summons.'

A spokesman for the Rod Laver Arena said: 'We took swift and appropriate action in conjunction with Victoria Police to ensure the venue was secure and free from risk.'
