An Ohio couple committed a crime when they recently gave child welfare officials a 9-year-old boy they raised from infancy, prosecutors say.

Cleveland Cox, 49, and Lisa Cox, 52, pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor counts of nonsupport, allegedly left the boy with children's services after saying he was displaying aggressive behavior and earlier threatened the family with a knife.

This is the couples' first court appearance since they voluntary turned themselves into police November 15 after a three month search mounted by authorities.

Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser has said there are legal consequences to what he called 'reckless' abandonment.

Unthinkable: Cleveland and Lisa Cox (L, R), talk to their attorney, as they turn themselves in Friday, November 15. Authorities say the couple returned their 9-year-old adopted son to the county after raising him since infancy

No comment: Mrs. Cox and their husband have not spoken publicly about the case. They pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor charges of nonsupport on Wednesday

Adolfo Olivas, an attorney appointed by the court to protect the boy's interests, has said the emotionally hurt and confused child is now receiving help that the parents should have gotten for him.

A defence attorney and prosecutor declined to comment after the hearing. The couple was scheduled to be in juvenile court later overnight for a pretrial hearing regarding custody of the child.

People within the adoption community say they worry about emotional trauma to the child. They say giving up a child after so much time is rare and undermines the stability and commitment that adopted children need.

Christopher Hehn, of Greenwood, Indiana, knows the importance of commitment after being shuffled from foster home to foster home before a social worker adopted him at age 12.

'When the going got tough, it was out
the door for me,' Hehn said. 'But when I was adopted, my mother said it
was forever, no matter what. She stuck it out, and I was finally able 
to trust again.'

Sixto 
Cancel, a 21-year Virginia Commonwealth University junior in Richmond, 
Virginia, also stressed the importance of stability for adopted 
children.

Cancel said he experienced abuse and never found a good fit, moving from a troubled adoptive home to foster care homes.

As
an adoptee, 'you need reassurance that you are not alone,' said Cancel,
who also is an advocate for adopted and fostered children.

Charged: The couple surrendered Butler County, Ohio authorities on November 15 (pictured). They now face misdemeanor charges of nonsupport

Well-to-do: The couple lived in this lovely neighborhood where the median income is around $100,000. They'd raised their son since he was three months old

Not a money problem: The Coxes live in this home valued at more than $330,000 home in Liberty Township

Threatening? Neighbors said the Coxes are good parents and people. One of them described the 9-year-old adopted boy as a 'bad seed.' The couple claims the boy has threatened them with a knife

'These are the only parents he has ever known': County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser, who usually doesn't seek indictments but finds the nature of this case to be exceptional

Greg and Robin Smith, of New Richmond, about 17 miles southeast of Cincinnati, became adoptive parents in a ceremony last week, adopting four siblings — ages 5 to 12 — who they cared for as foster children for more than three years.

Robin Smith acknowledged some anger and other issues among the children, stemming from their experiences before coming to the Smiths.

'But you just can't give up on children, not matter how hard the situation is,' she said.

Two biological brothers adopted this month by the Rev. Edward Byers and wife Darnette, of Cincinnati, say they know the 9-year-old must feel depressed and lonely.

'I know what it's like to move from 
house to house,' said the youngest brother, 14-year-old Tyshawn. 'But I 
would tell him to stay in there and not give up.'

Butler County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser has said there are legal consequences to what he called 'reckless' abandonment.

Extraordinary case: County Prosecutor Michael Gmoser said he doesn't usually seek indictments in misdemeanor cases but views this as an exceptional case

National adoption advocates say failed adoptions or dissolutions are rare in cases where the child has been raised from infancy. They said such discord seems to occur more often with youths adopted at an older age.

But Kathleen Strottman, executive director of the Washington-based Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, said that while there seems to be less trauma in children placed with adoptive parents as infants, emotional and behavioral issues can surface long after adoption.

Strottman said she was concerned about the wellbeing of the Ohio child, but she also worried that the threat of criminal prosecution could discourage adoptive parents from seeking help.

'I'm hoping that ultimately there was a good cause for this prosecution,' she said. 'What everyone wants is a child protection system that first and always stays focused on the needs of the child.'
