Firebrand senator Jacqui Lambie has revealed Botox is partly responsible for her new look, describing the wrinkle-smoothing procedure as 'addictive'.

The former Palmer United Party member has also spoken out about being single and has again hit out Prime Minister Tony Abbott, saying he needs to 'grow a pair'.

The article, which features in January's issue of Australian Women's Weekly, is accompanied by pictures of Senator Lambie's promised new look, with her signature pulled-back bun replaced with loose tresses.

The former Palmer United Party member has also spoken out about being single and has again hit out Prime Minister Tony Abbott, saying he needs to 'grow a pair'

In one of the photos she is brandishing an Australian flag, which draws inspiration from her idol, former Nation One leader Pauline Hanson who has been arguably as controversial as the Tasmanian senator.

Senator Lambie spoke to the magazine candidly about Botox and fillers as she prepared for the shoot.

'It's addictive. It's like "Oh my God, here comes that wrinkle again",' she said.

Senator Lambie - who recently broke away from the Palmer United Party after a very public stoush over defence pay - also spoke about how she had been single for more than a decade.

'I basically haven't been with anyone for 10 or 11 years, ' she said.

'I'm open to it. It's just to have that human contact would be nice.'

Ms Lambie had two children by the time she was 27 years old. 

She became pregnant at 18 with Brentyn and was with child while she trained for the army, which meant five-kilometre runs and 100 push-ups up until she reached the 20-week mark.

Her second child, Dylan, was a result of a relationship with fellow soldier John Milverton at 22.

They separated after years together as Senator Lambie does not believe in 'staying together for the sake of the kids' as it was 'a coward's way'.

After this relationship break-up, her career with the army stalled due to an ongoing back injury during training.

To try and reduce the burden on her back, the army contributed funds to reduce Senator Lambie's double-D breasts after having two children, which she says 'were hanging down'.

But she finally had to give up her army dreams after a trip to East Timor on her first deployment after she was strapped into a flak jacket, which 'was the end of me'.

The drugs she took for her back pain, similar to those prescribed to schizophrenics which 'messes with the chemicals in your brain', led her to be cared for by her son, Dylan.

But when he started going down the wrong path in life, Senator Lambie had to take him to a youth crisis centre and then she began questioning her capabilities as a parent.

'I began thinking "What use am I to anyone? I might as well end it. I'm a waste of space",' she said.

This is the point where Senator Lambie attempted to take her own life when she was drunk and walked in front of a car.

Senator Lambie says Tony Abbott 'doesn't wear the pants' in his office but chief of staff Peta Credlin does

Having spent 20 years working on her depression, the mother-of-two turned to politics and the Tasmanian senator catapulted herself into the spotlight with her frank - and sometimes shocking - opinions.

Most infamously describing her ideal man as one with 'heaps of cash' and had 'a package between their legs', and her position on banning the burqa, which has landed her in hot water.

But the final straw for PUP leader Clive Palmer was when Senator Lambie said she would vote against all government legislation until a defence force pay deal was reconsidered.

Despite being very vocal about her opinions of her former boss in the past, this time Senator Lambie only had tough words for Prime Minister Tony Abbott who she says has to 'grow a pair'.

'Females scare the crap out of him but he's going to have to grow a pair because he has to deal with me,' she said.

'My vote's important so if I was Tony Abbott, I'd be saying "Hey, Jacqui Lambie, let's have a cup of coffee".

'But he can't do that, can he? Because he doesn't wear the pants. The female in his office [chief of staff] Peta Credlin – she's the one that wears the pants.'
