Leaked government documents have revealed a number of disturbing sex acts that have taken place amongst children in two residential state care centers in Victoria.

The report, viewed by the Herald Sun, includes accounts of group sex and rape between vulnerable children under the age of 10 as well as incidents involving older residents.

According to the Herald Sun, the report recorded a nine-year-old boy telling his visiting mother that he had been raped by a 12-year-old boy while on a hammock.

The 12-year-old was found to have been involved in a previous police investigation involving another rape accusation.

However the Herald Sun revealed that the Department of Human Services staff who allocate children to homes were not made aware of the investigation.

In a separate occurrence at a state home in Melbourne's west, the article reported that four children under 13 participated in group sex acts in which a 12-year-old girl was sexually penetrated.

The girl was moved from the facility after medical investigations.

Three children under 11-years-old were also recorded admitting to similar behaviour.

The Herald Sun is now pushing the Department of Human Services to provide answers as to why children were placed in the same residential care units despite having histories of sexualized behaviours.

Staff told the publication that it was not uncommon for allegations against children regarding sexualized behaviour to be kept from them.

A lack of staff, supervision and staff training on sexualised behaviour has so far been attributed to the incidents.
