A pregnant model, who is less a month away from giving birth, has come under fire from her Instagram followers after sharing a series of saucy lingerie-clad selfies flaunting her barely-there baby-bump.

Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist, has documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy earning herself a huge number of fans in the process. However, as her pregnancy has progressed, more and more people have begun criticizing the mother-to-be, claiming that her unusually trim and toned figure could be doing damage to her unborn child.

'I would be so nervous!' one critic wrote. 'The baby is probably really small and I would imagine she will have a hard time making milk.’

Mom-to-be: Sarah Stage, a Los Angeles-based lingerie model, has been documenting her changing pregnancy body and many of her 1.1m Instagram followers cannot believe she is eight months pregnant 

Another added: 'Feed the baby! She's just cares about her looks, not the growing of the baby. So sad that the baby [will be] so tiny when he comes into the world.'

The model’s pictures have garnered thousands more similar comments, many of which criticize her for being 'unhealthy' and unnaturally small for a pregnant woman.

But while Sarah has faced her fair share of criticisms, others were more complimentary with their comments.

'Everyone is body shaming her. It’s really sad how quick everyone is to judge her and say that she is starving her baby, before actually educating yourselves on why she may look so small,' one person wrote. 

Proud: Sarah refuses to hide her eight month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it in lingerie

Meanwhile, another fan noted: 'Cuteset bump ever!' 

Despite her critics, Sarah refuses to hide her eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes and prefers to flaunt it on social media for the world to see.

Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent and lives in Los Angeles, shuns baggy dresses and instead dresses her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all.

The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa, spinach and chicken. 

Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah has continued to model whilst carrying.

Sarah's first modelling gig was at the tender age of two and the star, who is signed to Elite Model Management, has since adorned billboards and starred in countless campaigns.

According to Malaysian Digest, Sarah indulges in occasional cheeseburgers and maintains her trim frame is down to daily gym visits.

Comments from her followers include ones such as: 'she looks like me on a normal day' and 'my belly after a burger'.

And despite some of her followers criticizing her unique physique, one medical professional claims that, if she feels healthy and happy, Sarah has no need to worry about her baby. 

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant.

'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. 

'Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.'

Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman.

When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy.

Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.
