A mother embroiled in a custody dispute has killed herself, her three-year-old son and their dog after setting their home on fire - just hours after posting a picture of the young boy to Facebook.

Katherine Halverson, 32, put rags in front of a closed bedroom door, doused them with accelerant and then lit a match. She had also poured accelerant over herself and her son, fire officials said.

A neighbour called 911 at 
7.17pm on Tuesday after seeing smoke billowing from the attic of the home in Scotch Plains, New Jersey and 
firefighters raced to the scene and extinguished the flames.

Tragic: Katherine Halverson and her son Jeremy have died after she locked them in a room and set it on fire

But it was too late; Halverson and her son, Jeremy Scott McDonald Jr., were found unconscious in the room and taken to hospital where they were pronounced dead from smoke inhalation.

Their dog, an Afghan hound, was also found dead at the scene.

The deaths came just hours after Halverson, who did not leave a suicide note, uploaded a picture of her young son wearing a Santa hat as her profile picture on her Facebook page.

Authorities said they believe she took her and her son's lives as she was in the midst of a bitter custody battle, ABC7 reported.

Law enforcement officials told the New Jersey Star-Ledger that Halverson had appeared in state Superior Court earlier that day for a custody hearing.

Loss: Jeremy Scott McDonald Jr., 3, was remembered by neighbours as a bubbly, beautiful young boy. His mother posted this picture of him in a Santa hat to Facebook just hours before she took their lives

Killed: Halverson doused the room in accelerant and lit a match, also killing the family's dog, pictured

Theodore Romankow, the Union County prosecutor, added that, due to the condition of the home, it appeared the mother suffered a mental condition, but did not elaborate.

Halverson also lived at the home with her own mother, but she was working at the time of the fire.

Neighbour Barbara Parry, who lives in the other half of the duplex, said she called police after a fire alarm led her upstairs and she discovered smoke in the attic. She called 911.

But as there were no lights on at the home and she had not heard a sound through the walls, she assumed no one was in the building.

'It
came as a complete shock to all of us when they brought Kathy and 
Jeremy out,' she said. 'It was horrible. Completely horrible.'

Damage: Windows in the house are boarded up following the deadly fire on Tuesday evening

Parry,
who said the family had only moved into the house in April, paid 
tribute to the youngster, who she remembered comparing the size of his 
dog to her tiny Shih Tzu.

'He was always so happy and bubbly 
and he’d say things to you like he was giving you a speech. You’d just 
have to pretend you understood him,' she said. 'Such a beautiful little boy.'

Some neighbours said that Halverson kept to herself, while others called her a 'loner'.

She attended nearby Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School as a teenager and played wide receiver on the varsity football 
team. She was just one of three girls in 
New Jersey playing on boys' teams.

'This means a lot to me,' she told 
The Star-Ledger in 1995. 'I’m making history at my school and when I 
look back on my life, I’ll know I did something.'
