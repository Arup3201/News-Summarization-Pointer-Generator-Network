The owners of an iconic home used in Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo have become so sick of it being a tourist attraction that they have erected a 6ft-fence around it.

After 23 years of visits by film buffs, Hanna and Sandy Suleiman decided to build the wall outside their San Francisco house where Jimmy Stewart's character lived in 
the 1958 thriller.

The house is listed on websites as part of a film fan tour so over the past two decades the couple have had tourists eagerly lining up outside their home.

They have had fans ringing their door bell hoping to catch a glimpse of the inside of the 
house,  strangers picnicking on their fence and others tossing garbage 
into their yard.

But now the changes have annoyed Hitchcock fans - they have also added a
new entryway, and the Suleimans have put stucco over the brick chimney, reports the San Francisco Chronicle.

Their son Sasha, who oversaw the design work, insists that when the job is completed, 'the house will retain the same feel.'

'I took the changes seriously,' he said. 'But this isn't historic value - it's pop culture history.'

'The bottom line,' said Hanna Suleiman, 'is it's our house, we paid for it, we maintain it and we want to enjoy it.'

The house is listed on Movie Locations website which says: 'Falling for the possessed woman act, Scottie rescues Madeleine and takes her back to his apartment. Scottie’s home stands, virtually unchanged, at 900 Lombard Street on the corner of Jones Street, just at the foot of the series of famous hairpin bends on the "Crookedest Street in the World", which you'll recognise from films such as The Love Bug.'

The house was flagged for review as 'a potential historic resource' - based partly on its age because it is over 60 years old and partly because it featured in the film.

But it was waived because it was concluded the $15,000 work wouldn't cause any 'material impairment'.
