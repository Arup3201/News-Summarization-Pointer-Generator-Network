A passenger from an Emirates flight allegedly called a flight attendant a 'f****t' in an altercation over luggage at a bag carousel at Sydney airport.

At least four Australian Federal Police officers were called to carousel four at the airport just after 7pm yesterday after the Emirates employee complained about the alleged homophobic attack.

Footage of the confrontation shows the flight attendant claiming he was called a 'f****t' by the passenger from flight EK413 from Auckland, who became upset when he was asked to move out of the way for the crew's luggage.Â

In the video the Emirates staffer says: 'This man's discriminating, he called me a f****t.'

'What's your problem?' he then asks the passenger.

The passenger can then be heard complaining about the large number of crew bags which are blocking access to the carousel.

Police were then seen speaking to both men and taking down details.

An AFP spokeswoman said officers were asked to speak to a man after it was alleged that he had insulted an airline employee yesterday evening.

The man was a passenger from flight EK413 which had arrived from Auckland

'The airline employee requested an apology, which the passenger then provided,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'The AFP considers this matter finalised.'

Daily Mail Australia has asked Emirates for comment.

Sydney Airport declined to comment.
