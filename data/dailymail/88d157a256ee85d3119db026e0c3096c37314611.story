A DVD cover for a film about an Aboriginal girl group has been labelled 'racist and sexist' for relegating its female stars to the background to give Irish actor Chris O'Dowd centre stage.

The original DVD cover for The Sapphires features the four singers in prominent positions, with O'Dowd - who plays the group's manager - at the back.

But on the U.S. version of the DVD, O'Dowd takes centre stage while The Sapphires fade into an entirely blue background.

Spot the difference: On the Australian DVD cover, left, the Sapphires take centre stage, but in the U.S. version, seen right, Chris O'Dowd dominates the cover while the Aboriginal singers fade into a blue background

The drastic change saw a petition launched against the 'whitewashed and gender-washed' cover for the film - which is based on a true story - on social media, a report in The Telegraph said.

Lucy Manne, who started the online petition, said: 'The Sapphires is a wonderful film about four Aboriginal women battling against racism and sexism in the entertainment industry of the 1960s.

'That's why so many of us were 
disappointed to see a whitewashed and gender-washed cover that 
reinforces the problems The Sapphires worked so hard to overcome.'

Blogger MaryAnn Johanson agreed, writing on flickfilosopher.com: 'The women are Aborigines. They are black black black black blackety-black black. Not blue.

'Oh, and they're women.'

More than 10,000 people put their names to the petition, and U.S. distributor Anchor Bay Entertainment has now apologised for the cover.

The real-life members of The Sapphires had also written to the U.S. civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People to ask it to add its support to the campaign.

The letter on behalf of Laurel Robinson, Lois Peeler and their cousins Beverley Briggs and Naomi Mayers said: 'As
I'm sure you can appreciate, the treatment of people of colour in 
Australia mirrored much of the trauma to which people in the United 
States were subjected.

'That trauma – and much of that treatment – remains alive and well in Australia today, as I know it does in the United States.'

Anchor Bay issued a statement which said it 'regrets any unintentional upset', adding that 'new cover art is being considered for future replenishment orders'.

On the Australian DVD the names of 
the lead actresses; Deborah Mailman, Jessica Mauboy, Shari Sebbens and 
Miranda Tapsell, were given equal billing along with O'Dowd.

On the U.S. cover, only Chris O'Dowd's name appears.

According to the report O'Dowd, who was catapulted into the A-list by his role in smash hit comedy Bridesmaids, is said to have tweeted that the U.S. cover was 'misleading, it's ill-judged, insensitive and 
everything the film wasn't'.

His tweet is then said to have been deleted.
