Evidence: Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's former spin doctor, appears at the Leveson inquiry today

Tony Blair took three calls from Rupert Murdoch during the frenetic run-up to the Iraq War, his former spin chief confirmed yesterday.

But Alastair Campbell insisted that the then Prime Minister was never told what to do by the media mogul.

He told the Leveson Inquiry into media standards that, in the three calls, he believed Mr Murdoch had just wanted ‘a chat about what is going on’.

He added: ‘I was never witness to and don’t believe there was ever a discussion that said, “Now, Tony, if you do this and this and this, my papers will back you”. It just never happened.’

Mr Blair faced criticism that his government had placed few restrictions on the operation of News Corp’s newspapers or BSkyB, in which News Corp owned a 39.1 per cent stake, during his time in office.

Mr Campbell admitted Mr Blair was grateful for Mr Murdoch’s backing, particularly during the build-up to the 2003 Iraq War, when the Prime Minister was accused of following U.S. leader George W Bush blindly into war.

He said: ‘It was perfectly clear that
most of the media were opposed to what we were doing and Mr Murdoch’s 
titles were in favour, and I think it’s also fair to say that the Prime 
Minister would have appreciated that support.’

Asked why Mr Blair made time for three
calls during a period of frantic diplomacy, Mr Campbell said: ‘What I 
think was going on is that Rupert Murdoch has placed a call and Tony 
Blair has taken that call, and Rupert Murdoch is just wanting to have a 
chat.

‘He is a news man. I 
think it is a combination of Rupert Murdoch trying to find out what is 
going on and also probably saying, “You know, we’re going to support you
on this”.’

Mr Campbell said Cabinet Office records showed the two men had spoken on the phone a total of only six times between 2002 and 2005.

He conceded that Mr Blair would have been ‘crazy’ not to want the media mogul’s backing but denied the two men had made a deal in 1995, when the Labour leader attended the News Corporation annual conference on Hayman Island, off Australia.

In written evidence to the inquiry, he said: ‘It’s simply not the case to say no big decision was taken without Murdoch’s reaction being taken into account. 

‘I could list dozens of policy decisions on which he would have had no advance knowledge, from Budgets to Queen’s Speeches to peace processes and military action.’

Mr Campbell said Mr Murdoch had tended to use the back door during his visits to Downing Street, but said other visitors had  employed the same method of entry if they wanted to avoid cameras outside the front door.

Mr Murdoch’s former right-hand man Les Hinton hit back yesterday at a parliamentary committee which had accused him of ‘selective amnesia’ while giving evidence into phone hacking.

In a damning report, MPs claimed the ex-chairman of News International had misled Parliament and was ‘complicit’ in a cover-up over the scale of the scandal at the News of the World.

But Mr Hinton described the findings as ‘unfair, unfounded and erroneous’ and demanded that the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s allegations be withdrawn.

Press reform: Alastair Campbell told the Leveson inquiry today he thought there was a lack of political will to reform the way the media is regulated

The Leveson inquiry website was today apparently brought down by hackers as Alastair Campbell gave evidence.

The website provides live video coverage of the hearing as well as copies of witness statements.

On Twitter users were blaming hacking group Anonymous - but no one had claimed responsibility for the site.

Anonymous and Lulzsec have previously claimed they have hacked into government and News International websites.

Users said the website homepage had gone blank - although others were having no difficulties getting on it at all.

It is possible that rather than being hacked there was an internal problem with the website.

A spokesman for the inquiry said they were investigating the problems.

Lack of political will: Michael Gove said the Leveson inquiry had given rise to a 'chilling atmosphere' which threatened freedom of speech in the UK

Alastair Campbell also said that David Cameron did not want to set up the Leveson inquiry and there was a lack of political will to reform press regulation.

Mr Campbell said comments made at a Westminster lunch by Michael Gove in February were part of a wider Government strategy.

The Education Secretary said the inquiry had given rise to a 'chilling atmosphere' which threatened freedom of speech in the UK.

When
asked if there was a political will to regulate the media, Mr Campbell 
replied: 'No, if I'm being frank. I thought that Michael Gove's speech 
to the parliamentary gallery was part of the political strategy.

'I don't think that David Cameron particularly wants to have to deal with this.

'I don't think he wanted to set up the inquiry. He had to in the end.

'I
think it will be very difficult for him not to go along with whatever 
recommendations - or at least a very large part of the recommendations -
the inquiry produces. But I don't think there's much of an appetite.'

Meanwhile, Mr Campbell said that Mr Blair and 
other members of the Labour government had long believed there was a 
'real problem' in the relationship between the press and politicians.However, they did not take action to address the issues.

'I think there was a political point 
of pragmatism that Tony Blair would have taken the view that it was not 
politically sensible,' he said. 'It is no secret that this was one of 
the few things that we argued about.'

He added: 'He was further of the view
that whereas it was possible to fight and win elections and to govern 
with consensus with some of the media offside, to seek to do so with all
of them offside and in kill mode is very difficult indeed.'
