Madonna has apologized for calling her son, Rocco Ritchie, the N-word in an Instagram picture following a public outcry.

The outspoken entertainer 
landed in hot water on Friday after using the bizarre hastag '#disn****' in a caption accompanying a photo of her 13-year-old son boxing.

While she's not known for bowing down to criticism, the Material Girl deleted the image within minutes of posting it and last night issued a heartfelt apology.

Unapologetic: The offensive comment was taken down minutes later and replaced with a profane message urging Madonna's critics to get off her 'd*** haters'

'I am sorry if I offended anyone with my use of the N-word on Instagram,' she said in a public statement posted on her Instagram and Facebook feeds.

'It was not meant as a racial slur. I am not a racist. There's no way to defend the use of the word. It was all about intention.

'It was used as a term of endearment toward my son who is white. I appreciate that it's a provocative word and I apologize if it gave people the wrong impression. Forgive me.'

On Friday night, the 55-year-old singer posted a picture of Rocco boxing with the comment: 'No one messes with Dirty Soap! Mama said knock you out! #disn****'  

The offensive hashtag sparked outrage among some of her fans, prompting the mother-of-four to take down the caption just minutes later.

Initially, the pop star was unapologetic about using the racial slur.

She replaced her previous comment with a foul-mouthed message addressed to her critics: 'Ok let me start this again. # get off my d*** haters!'

Some of her one million followers ripped into the superstar for her use of the offensive term.

Queen Madge: Many of her loyal fans came to Madonna's defense, slamming her critics for misinterpreting her words 

One commenter wrote: 'MADONNA U NEED TO TAKE UR arthritis medicine instead of trying to be hip on the internet.’

'Spreading ignorance is awful!' another user noted.

But thousands of Madge's loyal fans quickly came to her defense.

One supporter of the singer and filmmaker even went so far as to say that she deserves a pass for using the N-word because she 'has basically adopted half of Africa,' Vibe.com reported. 

Madonna has two adopted children from Malawi, David Banda and Mercy James, both eight-years-old.

She had her son Rocco with her former husband, director Guy Ritchie, in 2000.

She also has a 17-year-old daughter, Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon, from a previous relationship with Cuban-born personal trainer Carlos Leon.

'Bring
 it! 2014!' Madonna shared an Instagram snap Saturday of her 13-year-old
 son Rocco Ritchie clutching a bottle of 94-proof Bombay Sapphire gin

The kerfuffle over the N-word hashtag comes less than two weeks after Madonna posted another photo featuring her 13-year-old son brandishing a bottle of 94-proof Bombay Sapphire gin.

'The party has just begun! Bring it! 2014,' the pop diva gushed on her Instagram account.

The image of the minor clutching a bottle of hard liquor along with a couple of friends displaying Belvedere vodka was taken in Switzerland, where the legal drinking age is 16.
