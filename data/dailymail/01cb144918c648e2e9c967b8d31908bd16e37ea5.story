West Ham chairman David Gold is 'hopeful' Winston Reid will snub Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal by signing a new contract.

The New Zealand central defender is out of contract this summer and had looked set for a move to Tottenham on a £60,000-a-week deal while Arsenal also showed an interest.

Talks between West Ham and Reid have led to a contract offer and, with the club sitting ninth in the Barclays Premier League, the 26-year-old is close to agreeing to stay.

In reply to a question on Twitter about whether Reid will stay, Gold replied: 'I am hopeful that Winston will sign for us.'

It would reflect another step forward for West Ham as they look to qualify for Europe this season, despite losing 3-1 against Crystal Palace at home on Saturday.

Sam Allardyce's team welcome Chelsea to Upton Park on Wednesday night where defender Reid is likely to have his hands full against the Premier League's leaders.

Reid joined West Ham from Danish club FC Midtjylland in 2010 and has been an impressive performer at the heart of their defence since his arrival, playing a key role this season.
