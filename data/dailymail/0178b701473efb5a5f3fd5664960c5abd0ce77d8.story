Karen Lyle, 50, was jailed for 22 years after she drugged her husband before dousing him in fuel and setting him alight

A woman who drugged her husband before dousing him in fuel and setting him alight has been jailed for 22 years.

Karen Lyle, 50, searched the internet for 'ways to poison somebody' before secretly administering a strong anti-depressant to husband Andrew.

She waited until Mr Lyle, 47, became drowsy and fell asleep on their bed - and then continued with her plot to murder him.

The father-of-two was only saved by the fact he woke up halfway through the 'horrific' attack, which left himÂ traumatised and with life-changing burns, Portsmouth Crown Court heard.

Lyle denied attempting to murder her husband at their home in Fareham, Hampshire, but was convicted by a jury at trial.

Nobody else was at home when the attack took place on July 2 last year.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'An investigation by specialists from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service concluded that the cause of this fire was a naked flame upon an ignitable liquid.

'Mr Lyle was treated at Queen Alexandra Hospital and later airlifted to the burns unit at Salisbury hospital, where he was treated for significant injuries.

'He remained there for approximately a month.

'The police investigation showed that there was evidence of the drug Mirtazapine - which causes drowsiness - in Mr Lyle's system.

'It was revealed during the court case that Mrs Lyle had given this to her husband without his knowledge.

'Evidence to show that Mrs Lyle has been searching online for information about poisoning someone, was presented to the court.'

Mr Lyle said after the case: 'This was an horrific attack, which has left me with life changing injuries and could easily have been fatal.

'The incident has deeply affected me and my two sons.

'The court case was traumatic for all my family, but I am content that justice has been done.

Mr Lyle was treated at Queen Alexandra Hospital (pictured) and later airlifted to the burns unit at Salisbury hospital, where he was treated for significant injuries.

'I am grateful to all the professionals who helped us through this.

'They include the burns unit at Salisbury Hospital, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, and the prosecution team.'

Detective Constable Rob Lowe, who led the police investigation, said: 'We welcome the sentence handed to Mrs Lyle and are pleased to have secured a prosecution following a joint investigation with our colleagues at Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service.'
