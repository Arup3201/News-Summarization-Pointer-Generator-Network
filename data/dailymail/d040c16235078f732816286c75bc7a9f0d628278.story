Myth? Contemporary biographers have turned Lewis Carroll (pictured in later life) into a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls

Lewis Carroll has been cast by many modern biographers as a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls that led him to take hundreds of nude photographs of them.

But a leading authority on the author has now claimed this is a ‘myth’ created by spurious and sloppy research.

Edward Wakeling has criticised biographers who have given the author of two of literature’s greatest children’s classics - Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass - a disturbing modern reputation.

Previously-unpublished letters and reminiscences of those who knew him are among thousands of documents which Mr Wakeling has collected over four decades.

They offer evidence that Carroll was in fact a sociable man who enjoyed adult company as much as children’s, he said, adding: ‘It’s both. You can’t just say it’s one and not the other.’

From an opus of some 3,000 photographs, Mr Wakeling has calculated that nude photographs of children represent ‘no more than 1 per cent of Carroll’s output’.

While Katie Roiphe wrote a novel portraying Carroll as holding sexual feelings towards his muse, biographer Morton N Cohen observed that it would be ‘naïve’ to suggest that Carroll’s interest in children was ‘strictly artistic’.

But Mr Wakeling points to unpublished material, including reminiscences of Mabel Amy Burton, who was eight when she met Carroll in 1877.

She recalled: ‘As a small child I much disliked strangers, but the personality of this gentleman attracted me and I chatted away with him quite freely.’

Young girl: Alice Liddell (pictured) was photographed many times by Carroll. Pictured above in 1858, she was the daughter of family friend Henry George Liddell and the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland

On news of his death, she wrote of the ‘irreparable loss in the hearts of many who had been his child-friends’.

Mr Wakeling says: ‘It is about time we cleared up, once and for all, the pervading false myth about [Carroll’s] unhealthy relationship with children. He was a lover of children but he was not an abuser of children.’

He added: ‘There must be 30 or 40 biographies since his nephew wrote the first one in 1898.

‘People who decide to write about Carroll realise that they’re not going to get their book published unless they can find a new angle.

‘Quite a few of them have scratched their head and come up with something outrageous and controversial like Lewis Carroll was Jack the Ripper, that he didn’t write Alice - Queen Victoria did - that he was having a sexual affair with Alice’s mother, and a lot more nonsense…

‘Then there are biographers who really don’t do their homework. They read a few other biographies, regurgitate them, add a few bits of speculation - and that’s it.’

Also pictured by Carroll: Gertrude Chataway, photographed (above) in 1876, was one of the author's closest friends. The girl inspired his nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark

Then, he suggests, like Chinese whispers, untrue facts get shared and embellished.

He argues that, if biographers went back to the primary sources, they would discover a very different picture of Lewis Carroll, the pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson.

As a writer of children’s books, Carroll (above) needed to explore children, a leading authority says

Mr Wakeling is a former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, who regularly advises auctioneers and exhibitions worldwide.

His books include Carroll’s ten-volume Diaries, which he edited in 2007 following their release by the family.

He also owns one of the finest Carrollian collections, including a database of 6,000 letters, of which some 4,000 are unpublished: ‘So there’s a great wealth of material I can draw on.’

He publishes his research later this month in a new book titled Lewis Carroll: The Man and His Circle.

Numerous ‘myths’ that he challenges include those relating to Carroll’s photography, of which perhaps the most prevalent – ‘frequently used by writers, biographers and journalists’ – is the supposed large body of studies of nude children: ‘This is not borne out by the facts.’

He argues that picturing nude children and focussing his camera on girls was common practice among Victorian photographers and that, when Carroll visited family friends, boys were more likely to be away at school.

Vilifying a man who believed in girls’ education is therefore unjustified. Anyway, there are as well many photographs of boys and adults.

As a writer of children’s books, Carroll needed to explore children, Mr Wakeling pointed out: ‘His relationship with children is not an all-encompassing part of his life, which many of the biographers tried to suggest.

‘He was a teacher. He actually enjoyed the intellectual banter that he could have with children. Children in Victorian times found that very refreshing because it was very uncommon for someone to treat them as equals. Children were seen and not heard.’

Photographed: Carroll also took portraits of poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1857 (left) and Prince Leopold, the eighth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1875 (right)

For Carroll, Mr Wakeling added, ‘they were seen and heard’. Reviewing reminiscences by Carroll’s child-friends, Mr Wakeling could not find ‘a bad word spoken against him’.

Those friends included Edith Litton, who described Carroll as ‘one of my most delightful friends’ with a ‘sweet smile’.

She was seven when he read her the story of Hans Andersen’s Ugly Duckling: ‘Being very sensitive about my ugly little self, it greatly interested me.’ He told her that ‘it was better to be good, truthful’.

Mr Wakeling ridicules Carroll’s portrayal as an eccentric misfit: ‘The vast majority of the biographers say he was a shy, reclusive man. Nonsense. He was a socialite.

‘He mixed with the great and the good of Victorian society - all the Pre-Raphaelites, Arthur Sullivan [the composer], famous politicians.

‘He was a friend of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, whose parties he was often invited to. This man is not a recluse and he isn’t shy.’

His evidence includes an unpublished letter from Lady Georgina Salisbury, telling Carroll: ‘The children are very anxious you should come to their party… and, if you could come on the 31st and stay over the 3rd January, we should be delighted to see you.’

His circle of friends included Sir James Paget, surgeon to Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. 

In response to Carroll’s concern for a friend who was dying from cancer, Paget wrote: ‘I will gladly see the poor lady.’

‘Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it,’ thought Carroll, and in Mr Wakeling’s book it is clear: to defend him from his modern character assassins.

The book is published ahead of next year’s celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice, and include a major BBC documentary, books and exhibitions worldwide. 

But no doubt those with suspicious minds will be back.
