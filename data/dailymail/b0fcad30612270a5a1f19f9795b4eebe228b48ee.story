A video clip shows the incredible moment a kayaker gets up close to a 44,000-pound humpback whale that surfaced right underneath him.

Berthold Hinrichs was paddling to Gryllefjord Village, Norway, when he saw a pod of wales on all sides of him.

The video pans round and three whales can be seen rising out of the water just a few metres from his craft.

Shock: The huge form of the whale can be seen rising up right underneath the kayak

Splash: The force of the whale bumping the kayak nearly causes Mr Hinrichs to capsize

Whales: A pod of three whales can be seen swimming on all sides of the kayak

As Mr Hinrichs carries on paddling to shore, one of the whales emerges out of the water to the right of him.

Undeterred, he calmly carries on crossing the water but what happens next shows the power of the huge animal.

Suddenly, the whale rises out of the water almost directly under his kayak - causing him to nearly capsize.

The whale playfully blows out air before submerging and lazily drifting away.

Pawnation reports the whale could have been attracted to herring in the fjord or could have just been surfacing for air.

Mr Hinrichs managed to stay upright and calm even though he was shaken by the huge whale.

Writing on his Facebook page, he said: 'I am quite dizzy!'

The video already has more than 18,000 views on YouTube.

Humpback whales can grow up to 52ft long and weigh 79,000 pounds and their diet is mainly krill or small fish.
