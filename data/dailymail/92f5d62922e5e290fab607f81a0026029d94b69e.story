Killed: Anthony Grainger was shot in the chest during the swoop

Children fled in terror as armed police opened fired on a gang of robbery suspects and killed a convicted criminal whose drugs trial collapsed after a juror contacted a defendant on Facebook.

Youngsters in a playground ran for cover while teenagers cowered in a pizza takeaway shop as police gunned down Anthony Grainger in Culcheth, Cheshire.

The 35-year-old father was shot in the chest by officers who wore protective masks and let off CS gas as they moved in on a red 
Audi hatchback on Saturday night.

The fatal shot was fired through the windscreen and local reports suggested that the killer round may have penetrated his heart.

A police source said officers had been tracking the car for some time in the belief that those inside were about to carry out a robbery.

When the occupants were seen allegedly putting on balaclavas, armed officers surrounded the car and ordered the three men inside to put their hands up.

It is believed Grainger did not do so. Moments later, officers opened fire.

Two other men were held after the swoop, which Greater Manchester Police said was a 'pre-planned operation' following a tip-off.

They refused to say whether Grainger, from Bolton, was armed and it is not known if any weapons were recovered from the car.

He is the first person to be killed by police marksmen since the death of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, which sparked the riots last summer.

Saturday's
incident, which came two weeks after a machete-wielding gang robbed a 
Co-Op store, is now under investigation by the the Independent Police 
Complaints Commission (IPCC).

Witnesses described how terror spread across the village as officers from the Specialist Operations branch swooped on the village, which is 15 miles west on Manchester.

Jessica
Brown, 15, said she was with friends in the Village Pizza takeaway when
a couple came in and warned them to 'stand back against 
the wall'.

'I later looked out of the window and
saw three people in black clothing with gas masks on and saw other 
people chasing them,' she said.

'When we came outside there was gas in the air, you could smell it.

'I then saw a black van with three or 
four people inside drive towards the car park. One of them was leaning 
outside the window and I later heard shots.

'It all looked like something off a film. It did not feel real at all. It was horrible.'

Her father Anthony described his fear over 'mad men running around with guns shooting'.

He
said his first thought was to get children inside and added: 'You don't
want the kids outside when there's mad men running round with guns 
shooting.'

Jessica said a large number of her friends
were also congregated in a playground in Common Lane and many ran for 
cover towards the shopping precinct as the scene unfolded.

Grainger’s girlfriend Gail Hadfield, 
29, today condemned the ‘dirty b****** police who should never have 
fired on a man sat in a car in the corner of a car park’.

In a defiant misspelled message, she 
said: ‘You cant help who you fall in love with and they have been the 
best days of my life, not one regret, he is the most perfect caring man i
have ever known.

‘God only takes the good ones.

‘He will be my everything forever, 
until the day we can be 2gva again, i send my love to your poor 
children, who have also lost, and your family.
‘I know you are up there waiting for me babe x and i can only count the days till we are back together.... I LOVE YOU X X X X.’

In 2010 Grainger, had been accused
of being linked to a plot to corrupt a drugs squad officer into selling
secret information in return for a £20,000 BMW and other bribes.

But the trial collapsed – at a cost of
£6million – after it emerged that juror Joanne Fraill had discussed the
case on Facebook with one of his co-defendants, Jamie Sewart. Fraill, 
40, was jailed for eight months.

A fresh jury failed to reach a verdict
on drugs charges against Grainger, but he was jailed for 20 months for 
handling stolen goods.

Mr Grainger's brother Stuart was jailed in 2001 for the murder of Derek Ianson. He was gunned down at his home in Salford.

A spokesman for IPCC said Mr Grainger died of a single 
gunshot wound to the chest.

He added: 'An inquest will be formally opened this afternoon at Warrington Coroners Court.

'IPCC investigators are continuing with their investigation into the death and have been present at the scene since last night.

'The independent investigation will 
consider the actions of all the officers at the scene, as well as the 
planning, decision making and implementation of the operation which led 
to the death.'

It is understood the operation was 
part of an investigation led by Greater Manchester Police into a planned
robbery in the vicinity and did not involve other forces or the North 
West Regional Organised Crime Unit (Titan) which tackles serious and 
organised crime gangs.

His body was taken away from the 
scene yesterday by private ambulance. Flowers nearby were left 
together with a handwritten note, saying 'RIP bro' and adding 'from your
family'.

Greater
Manchester's Deputy Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: 'Officers from 
our Specialist Operations branch were involved in an pre-planned 
operation that resulted in a car being stopped in the Culcheth area of 
Cheshire.

'As part of the operation, shots were fired and one man inside the vehicle was injured.

'The officers involved performed 
first aid on the victim at the scene but he sadly died. Two other men 
who were inside the car were arrested and will be questioned later 
today.

'This incident has been referred to 
the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) who will carry out 
an independent inquiry to establish all the facts.

'I understand there will be a lot of 
anxious people both in the Cheshire community where this happened, and 
across Greater Manchester itself. I also understand there will 
inevitably be speculation about what happened and the events leading up 
to this man's death.

Held: Robert Rimmer (left) and David Totton have been charged with conspiracy to rob

Tributes: Flowers were left at the scene, with a handwritten note declaring 'RIP bro'

'Because there is an IPCC independent
investigation, I cannot go into the specific details of the operation 
but equally I do want to provide some reassurance to people.

'Firstly, our thoughts are with the 
man's family during what will clearly be a very difficult and emotional 
time, and specially trained family liaison officers have been in contact
with the family.

'I want to assure them that ourselves, Cheshire Police 
and the Independent Police Complaints Commission will carry out a 
thorough investigation which will establish all the facts.

'I also want to stress that the Force
is providing significant welfare and support to officers from the 
firearms team and we are working with the Police Federation and the 
Superintendents Association as part of that support process.

'We are also working very closely 
with both Cheshire Police and the wider communities who will be affected
by this incident to give those people the support they need over the 
coming days and weeks.

Scene: The grey car appeared to block the red car, which was left with what seemed to be a bullet hole in the windscreen, according to eyewitnesses who saw the shooting at around 7.20pm last night in the village of Culcheth, Cheshire

Taped off: A police officer at the scene where a man was shot after a car was stopped during 'a pre-planned operation'

Evidence: A forensic officer gathers evidence following the fatal shooting, which is being investigated by the IPCC

Investigation: Officers work on the case, following the incident which left residents terrified

'Again, there are some details we 
will not be able to go into because of the independent inquiry but we 
will continue to keep our communities updated with what information we 
can share.'

silver grey Audi was positioned in front of the red car sideways and appeared to be blocking it in.

Posts
on a local social networking website forum referred to a 'noticeably 
high presence of police' in Culcheth in the past few days.

'It's almost as if there was an anticipation of something going to happen last night,' one person wrote.

There was also speculation that the shooting may have arisen from an attempted robbery of a village shop.

The Co-op store was the scene of a recent robbery in which a machete was used.

Three men entered the Co-op on February 18 at 9.05pm with one of them carrying the weapon covered by a bag.

Cigarettes were taken from behind the counter and stuffed into a duvet before a male employee was punched in the face.

The robbers made off in a grey Audi on the A574 towards Glazebury before the vehicle was found abandoned nearby.

Earlier this week, Cheshire 
Constabulary issued CCTV stills of the balaclava-clad raiders inside the
shop as they appealed for more information.

Cheshire police said yesterday: 'Police patrols have been increased in the area, and the community of Culcheth 
should be reassured that this is an isolated incident and there is no 
risk to the community as a whole.' 

A GMP spokesman refused to comment on whether Grainger had been shot through the heart.

Three men appeared at Manchester Magistrates Court charged with conspiracy to commit robbery.

David Totton, 33, of Manchester; Joseph Travers, 27, of no fixed address; and Robert Rimmer, 26, of  New Moston, were remanded to appear at Manchester Crown Court on March 19.
