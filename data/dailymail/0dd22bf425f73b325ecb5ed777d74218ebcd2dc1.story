A two-year-old girl has died after accidentally shooting herself with a handgun she found lying around her home.

The toddler - named by neighbors as Coco - got hold of the 'unsecured' loaded weapon at the home in North Carolina, police said.

'The child sustained the injuries due to an unsecured handgun in the residence. We have obtained that handgun', Cpt. Charles Hunter with the Fayetteville Police Department told WNCN.com.

Police said the girl was not breathing when they arrived at the scene in the 2600 block area of Graham Road at 12.40 pm on Saturday.

She was taken to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center while medics battled to revive her but without success.

She was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.

Neighbor Byron Brown told WNCN.com: 'She was just in my yard playing with my dog and for something like this to happen you know it's devastating'.

He added: 'The gun shouldn't have been in her presence. She shouldn't have been able to look at it let alone touch it.

Dave Smith lives just a few blocks away from the home and said his daughter was planning on visiting soon, but now he won't let her come.

Felicia Brown said there's been one too many shootings in the neighborhood and that the latest shooting, albeit accidental, was the last straw. She's moving as soon as possible.

Currently no charges have been filed yet, but the police say as the investigation continues, that will most likely change.
