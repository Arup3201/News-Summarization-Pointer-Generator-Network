As an England ‘fan’, I’m still buzzing about that win over Wales, while the coach in me is trying not to get too carried away. There is no question, however, that the result was huge leap forward for Stuart Lancaster’s team - the night we started to see their World Cup team and gameplan take shape. What a start to 2015, which is Rugby Year.

England were comfortably better than Wales and would have won by more save for a few errors. But most important of all, Friday was also the night we saw a sea change in England’s mindset and attitude and that’s what excited me the most. It was like seeing boys suddenly becoming men.

It all started with Chris Robshaw and that stand-off in the tunnel before the game when he refused to lead England out until he got an assurance that Wales would follow within a minute.

8.00pm: England, led by Chris Robshaw, leave their changing room and stand in the tunnel.

8.01pm: Meanwhile, in their half, the Welsh replacements line the corridor waiting for the arrival of their starting XV. Robshaw, not keen to cede the advantage to Wales by waiting on the pitch, stands his ground in scenes reminiscent of 2003 when Martin Johnson refused to move to accommodate Ireland on the red carpet in Dublin.

8.02pm: Referee Jerome Garces urges Robshaw and his side to take to the pitch. Mike Brown has a word with his captain but he is unmoved, ball under his arm.

8.03pm: The BBC cameras flick between disgruntled-looking Welsh substitutes and Robshaw, who stares straight ahead with unblinking focus.

8.04pm: Robshaw gives the nod to the panicking officials. Garces confirms if the Welsh don’t follow inside a minute, he has licence to head back to the dressing room. England leave the tunnel, on their own terms, and are greeted by boos from the crowd.

8.07pm: Two minutes after the scheduled kick-off time, Sam Warburton leads out Wales.

8.10pm: After two emotional anthems the game finally kicks off, five minutes late.

England wouldn’t have been the first team to be left hanging out there for three or four minutes while Wales cranked things up and choreographed their big emotional entrance. They must spend days rehearsing all this nonsense.

I loved that stubborn defiance even if some of my commentating colleagues thought it disgraceful! It was brilliant, great theatre but very significant. 

Let me assure you that all sorts of things kick off behind the scenes at Six Nations matches and you need to stand your ground. Otherwise you will get trampled over or even bullied.

One of my concerns about this England team had been that they are just a bit too ‘nice’ and accommodating, which can win you friends but sometimes lose you matches. 

For example, they let others dictate the itinerary of their summer tour of New Zealand which left them without half of their best players for the vital first Test, which was always the key game. They are only now recovering from that.

So, inwardly, I was cheering loudly when Robshaw played hardball and refused to make life easy for the Six Nations officials and TV people trying to hurry England on to the pitch for the scheduled 8.05 kick-off. 

There was more than a hint of Martin Johnson and memories came flooding back of Dublin 2003, when Johnno refused to move to the other side of the halfway line for the presentations with the Irish president. It’s what champions do.

NO MORE MR NICE GUYS

Robshaw’s stance was absolutely justified as he sought assurance from the referee that Wales would be made to follow him out within a minute or he would take them back down the tunnel. And there was a bigger message there as well. ‘This is 2015, this is our year, we are England and we are not going to be pushed around. No more Mr Nice Guys’.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster hailed his side's 21-16 win against Wales as the best of his career 

Fantastic. That’s exactly the approach England must assume this year and I sensed a new bloody mindedness in their attitude on Friday night from one to 15. This was just brilliant and the essence of competitive sport.

It was a huge night for Robshaw and he came through with flying colours. James Haskell and Ben Youngs were my main contenders for man of the match but the England skipper was just half a stride behind them along with Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph. He absorbed all the lessons and hurt from two years ago when England were humbled and made them into a positive.

Robshaw led well and as a player he never falters, he goes the full 80 minutes and has an astonishing capacity for work. I have never doubted his place in the team, only his position, because I am sure he could go equally well at blindside or even No 8. But that debate is now over: openside flanker it is.

England scrum half Ben Youngs controlled matters beautifully from the base against Warren Gatland's side 

As for Haskell, his display at blindside is indicative of England’s new approach. Haskell is an aggressive, in-your-face player, the sort the opposition love to hate. He is pro-active and positive, whereas in the past England have been too defensive. With him and Robshaw in unison and Billy Vunipola going well for the full 80 -  the first time he has completed a Test, which again was a big statement - the England back row definitely outplayed their much vaunted opposite numbers.

THE BATH CONNECTION

Behind the scrum it wasn’t error free but it looked much livelier and I applaud the fact that the young Bath trio of George Ford, Joseph and Watson were picked for what they can bring to England’s attack regardless of any perceived defensive frailities.

When it comes to Test rugby, players invariably raise their defensive games anyway. The Bath boys were all rock solid in the tackle and Watson, as well as taking his try brilliantly, has the all-round defence you would expect from somebody who plays regularly at full-back.

Watson and Mike Brown are developing a good rapport down the right and Joseph’s try is exactly what you would expect from a player with flair and a bit of X-factor. These young guns just need a platform. They are not miracle workers and they won’t produce magic every time, but give them enough possession going forward, over a period of time, and they will conjure up something very nice. 

Ford impresses me more with every game. He is not playing by numbers, England are letting him run the show and under intense pressure he produced a mature performance. That big match-clinching penalty at the end will have done his goal-kicking confidence a power of good. Players remember moments like that when they present themselves again.

MEDICAL MATTERS

Away from England for a moment, I was a concerned with the handling of two Wales injuries. Dan Biggar picked up a horrible bloody cut to his face and clearly need to come straight off and get the wound sorted with haemostats, stitched and bandaged up properly. 

Rhys Priestland was on the bench as a straight blood replacement and it was a nonsense delaying the game and trying to treat Biggar on the pitch. The referee should have insisted he leave the field of play .

As for George North, to these eyes he clearly picked up a concussion in the second half after an accidental clash of heads with Richard Hibbard. The slow motion showed him go limp, which is usually the giveaway sign, and he looked very groggy. Yet he was allowed to continue.

George North copped a boot to the face from Attwood in the first half and then appeared to be knocked out after a clash of heads with Hibbard (above) but, incredibly, the Welsh winger finished the match on the pitch 

I welcome the news that the world governing body - World Rugby - are demanding a report from the WRU on the assessment of North during the game. He also suffered a kick in the head in the first half and went off for eight minutes. It’s not a matter of establishing any ‘guilt’ - if there is any - but we must make sure rugby has its protocols correct and we are implementing them properly.

Unfortunately, rugby seems to believe it is leading in this area but still lags behind other sports in its approach to player welfare when it comes to injuries. There is nothing more important than an individual’s health and we have too many players getting injured now. Why?
