A ramshackle garage in north London that does not even come with planning permission has gone on sale for £359,950.

The 640 square foot single-storey building is located in Springdale Mews in Stoke Newington - where the average house price is in excess of £614,000. 

A spokesman for Courtneys estate agent, who is advertising the garage, said:  'I know it seems crazy, but that's just the market. It could be a good investment.'

The 640 square foot single-storey garage in Stoke Newington is being advertised for £359,950

A Courtneys estate agent said: 'I know it seems crazy, but that's just the market. It could be a good investment'

The garage is the latest in a trend of tiny plots of land without planning permission that are being advertised or sold for huge sums because of the  shortage of housing in London

On the Courtneys website, it says: 'The property is in a very quiet and central area just north of Newington Green with Dalston and Stoke Newington Church Street also very close by.

'Based on a few other former garages in the same mews road being developed into residental premises, we believe that this property can be developed into a two-storey three-bedroom mews house.' 

According to the agents, a similar sized three-bed ex-council house in the area would cost in excess of £460,000.

A similar garage in the same road was converted into a home in 2007 – and is now being rented out for £350 a week. 

But specialist architect Martyn Brown, the managing director of Everchanging Mews, warned of the extra costs that come when developing garages.

He told the Evening Standard: 'I would estimate you could spend the same again as the purchase price - between £300,000 and £350,000. It could take between 12 and 18 months to do - depending on how long getting planning permission takes and the state of the property.

'Also, as it is one of the first in this row to be converted, you could be living on a building site for 10 years as the rest of them are turned into houses.'

The average price in Greater London hit £533,489 between April and June – up 12 per cent from last year

Because of the shortage of housing in London, tiny plots of land without planning permission are being sold

The garage is the latest in a trend of tiny plots of land without planning permission that are being advertised or sold for huge sums because of the chronic shortage of housing in London. 

Last month, a row of three 1950s garages near Wandsworth Common sold for £500,000 — four times the guide price — after an auction bidding frenzy.

The new owner is expected to apply to demolish the lock-ups and build a house on the site, in the desirable residential area.

In May, six garages in affluent Parsons Green sold for £700,000. 

And in April, a run-down garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court, off Peckham Road, went for £550,000 after a bidding war. 

The brick-built former coach house was used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car.  

In April, this garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court was sold for £550,000 in an auction

In August 2013, a 224sqft Highgate lock-up which was transformed into a studio flat sold for £250,000. Two months later, a double garage in the area sold for £251,000.

Across London as a whole, the average home is now worth more than half a million pounds, according to the latest Land Registry figures. 

The average price in Greater London hit £533,489 between April and June – up 12 per cent on the same time last year.

This compared to the average house price in England and Wales that reached £256,883 by June.

For the same price as the garage, buyers could get this castle in Clackmannanshire, Scotland

Buyers could also snap up the six-acre Caribbean island of 'Bonefish' cay in the Bahamas for £360,000

This Grade-II listed pub, Ye Old Star Inn, in East Yorkshire, that also has an 11 bedroom hotel and restaurant is being sold for the same price as the North London garage 

For the same price as the dilapidated North London garage, prospective buyers could snap up the six-acre Caribbean island of 'Bonefish' cay in the Bahamas. 

The luxury island that has two long, white beaches is currently unoccupied, but an area has been landscaped in preparation for a luxury house.

Alternatively, they could buy 'Mansion House' in Clackmannanshire, Scotland, part of a former Scots Baronial Castle close to the town of Dollar. The house is set within 5 acres of gardens and grounds. 

They could also purchase an East Yorkshire pub - the Grade-II listed Ye Old Star Inn - in the Old Town area of Bridlington that comprises an 11 bedroom hotel and a restaurant.

In 2010 a dilapidated row of storage units in Primrose Hill went on the market with a whopping £1.25million asking price.

In 2012 a six-metre long garage (pictured below) went on the market for £525,000, but that was because of its pricey postcode in Knightsbridge - home to Harrods and some of the world's richest people. 

The garage in Knightsbridge (pictured) is part of a trend that has seen sales in garages boom in recent years

In August 2013, a 224sqft Highgate lock-up which was transformed into a studio flat sold for £250,000. Two months later, a double garage in the area sold for £251,000. 

In April, a run-down garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court, off Peckham Road, went for £550,000 after a bidding war.
