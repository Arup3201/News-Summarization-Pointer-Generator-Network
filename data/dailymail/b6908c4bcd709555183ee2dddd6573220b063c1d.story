A toddler in Arizona was killed yesterday after getting in the middle of a fight between three pit bulls.

Two-year-old Daniel  was staying with a babysitter in Gilbert for the weekend with his siblings when the fight broke out around 11am .

The 28-year-old babysitter attempted to pull her dogs off of the boy, and was injured herself.

Quarantined: The three dogs will be held in quarantine for 10 days by the Maricopa County Animal Control. The above dogs are currently under quarantine at the control's west shelter. It's unclear if these are the pit bulls that attacked the boy

Victim: The 28-year-old babysitter was also injured in the fray and had to undergo surgery yesterday

When emergency responders arrived, the boy was transported to Gilbert Mercy Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

The babysitter was taken to Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn Medical Center with injuries on her arms and legs.

She underwent surgery and was last reported in stable condition.

Both of the boys parents were notified about the tragic death.

His mother was in Flagstaff and immediately left to return to Gilbert.

She told Fox 10 she is 'numb' and can't think straight after hearing of her son's death.

The three dogs have been seized by Maricopa County Animal Control where they will remain for 10 days under quarantine.

It's up to the babysitter after that on whether she wants to turn over the dogs or taken them back.

'We definitely don't want to put a dog back into a community if the dog has a history of being aggressive,' Melissa Gable, a representative for the center, told 12 News.

Police say they are currently investigating the incident, but so far believe it was just an accident.

'Right now we're looking at it as a tragic terrible accident,' said Gilbert Police Sgt Jesse Sanger. 'But if the investigators get in there and find something...there's always a possibility charges could be filed in this case.'

The other children at the house, two 9-year-old boys and two girls, ages 6 and 7, were uninjured.
