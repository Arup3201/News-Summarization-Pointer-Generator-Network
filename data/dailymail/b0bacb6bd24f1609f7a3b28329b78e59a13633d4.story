In the running: Anthony Weiner is about to announce his campaign to be Mayor of New York

Anthony Weiner is about to announce that he will run to be Mayor of New York City, it was reported today.

The disgraced former congressman has 
been flirting with the idea of a political comeback ever since he 
re-emerged into the public eye earlier this year.

Now he is believed to have appointed a campaign manager, and will officially announce his candidacy within the next few days.

Mr Weiner, 48, was forced to resign 
as U.S. congressman for a district in Queens in 2011 after it emerged 
that he had sent explicit pictures of himself to a 21-year-old woman.

Over the past few months the Democrat
has conducted a series of interviews in a bid to rehabilitate his 
public image, and has long been suspected of harbouring an ambition to 
succeed Michael Bloomberg as Mayor.

One poll last month put Mr Weiner at second place among New York voters, behind only the current favourite Christine Quinn.

Now sources have confirmed that he 
will announce his candidacy before Memorial Day on May 27 in order to 
meet the deadlines for filing election papers next month.

'He's definitely running,' a friend told the New York Post today.

A major step towards confirming his 
candidacy came this month when Mr Weiner hired Danny Kedem as his 
campaign manager, according to Politico.

Mr Kedem is an experienced Democratic
operative who was involved with a congressional campaign in Staten 
Island ahead of last year's elections.

The candidate has also hired a press secretary and is moving to appoint staff to other key roles.

Couple: Mr Weiner is married Huma Abedin, who is one of the top aides to Hillary Clinton

Mr Weiner suffered a blow this week 
when it emerged that he will not attract the support of Bill and Hillary
Clinton, who have distanced themselves from him despite their 
friendship with his wife Huma Abedin, one of the top aides to the former
Secretary of State.

'The Clintons wish Weiner would just 
disappear. Every time he pops up, it’s a reminder of Bill’s scandal with
Monica Lewinsky, and it isn’t helpful to Hillary’s hopes for 2016,' an 
unidentified Democrat told the New York Post's Page Six.

The references to Lewinsky will 
inevitably be a distraction if Hillary decides
to run as the Democratic nominee for president in the next election, 
and since many consider her the party's front runner, it is important 
for her to take steps to keep it that way.

Close: But Mrs Clinton and her husband are unlikely to support Mr Weiner's mayoral bid this year

Overlapping: Hillary, seen here when she was a Senator for New York, worked with then-congressman Anthony Weiner and knows him socially through her work with Huma

Mr
Weiner has been opening up publicly in the last month through a series 
of interviews to reintroduce himself to New Yorkers, and in one of the 
profiles Ms Abedin told The New York Times that Mrs Clinton was a major source of support for her when the scandal broke.

'We’ve had a lot of personal 
conversations, none of which I feel comfortable talking about. But what I
will say about her, and for that matter her entire family, the 
unconditional love and support they have given me has been a real gift,'
she told the Times.

It 
comes as little shock that Ms Abedin finds the former President a 
supportive friend as well, since he performed her wedding ceremony in 
2010.

The potential 
problems with a Weiner campaign are effectively connected to how close 
Ms Abedin is with her longtime boss, who is now considered favourite to 
be the next Democratic presidential nominee.
