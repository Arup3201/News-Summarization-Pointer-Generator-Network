'Career ruined': Model-maker Katie Ward (pictured) is suing an architecture firm for £280,000 after severing a finger on a circular during a work experience placement

A promising young artist who severed a finger on a circular saw during a work experience placement is suing the company for £280,000.

Katie Ward, 28, said her dream of a film industry career was destroyed when her left index finger was sliced off while operating the unguarded machinery on her second day at London-based architecture firm Allies & Morrison.

The finger was re-attached by surgeons, but says she has not been been able to use her left hand properly since.

She is now at the centre of a test case in which senior judges are being asked to define what is meant by 'disability'.

Miss Ward, of Royal Leamington Spa, was awarded around £80,000 damages at Coventry County Court in April last year, but her lawyers are now arguing at London's Appeal Court that it was nowhere near enough for the devastating impact on her future.

They say she should have received nearly £280,000.

Miss Ward graduated with a first-class honours degree in model making from Bournemouth Arts Institute in July 2006 and her ambition was to pursue a career making sets and props for film and theatre.

But disaster struck on the second day of a work experience placement with Allies & Morrison, when her left index finger was cut off by an unguarded circular saw while she was cutting wood - without supervision - for a model.

Although surgeons managed to re-attach her finger, she was left with reduced function in her left hand and her lawyers said the finger was 'more hindrance than help'.

She also continues to suffer pain in her left hand and post-traumatic stress disorder, which has affected her ability to work with machinery.

As a result of the accident, she had to take an administrative job at a college instead of pursuing her chosen career path.

During the hearing at the county court, Katie told Judge Anthony Cleary she was 'embarrassed' by a sculpture she created of a Wallace and Gromit character - made after her accident.

However, the judge said he could see 'little difference' in quality between that and her earlier work and he did not detect she had lost any of her 'artistic flair or skill'.

He added: 'I do not for one moment trivialise the injury, nor its consequences, but it is plain to me from what I have observed that the index finger is an inconvenience rather than a disability.'

The judge also accepted evidence from one of Katie's former visiting tutors that he had worked on the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film with a model maker who had a prosthetic hand.

Judge Cleary concluded: 'From the evidence which has been put before me, I am unable to find that this young woman, either as a matter of fact or law, fulfils the criteria of a disabled person.'

When it came to assessing her loss of future earnings, the judge said a career in model making was 'simply beyond' her - not because she lacked skill, but because she had lost motivation due to the accident and was now 'far behind the pack'.

However, he found she could earn at least as much in another field as she would have earned as a freelance model maker, without steady employment.

Challenging the judge's decision, Katie's lawyers argued he was wrong to find she was 'not disabled' - which greatly reduced her payout for loss of future earnings.

Her barrister, Theodore Huckle QC, said: 'The judge appears to have wrongly concluded that, because the claimant can and does still do things, including with her injured hand, and because she can continue to do things in part by avoiding use of that hand, then she is not to be regarded as "disabled" for these purposes.'

He also said the judge should have found that her ongoing phobia of machinery is a further disability and that, had he found she was disabled, her loss of future earnings would have been calculated differently.

Rohan Pershad QC, for Allies & Morrison, argued Judge Cleary reached the correct decision on the evidence before him and that the level of damages he awarded was appropriate.

Lord Justice Aikens, sitting with Lord Justice Kitchin and Sir Richard Buxton, reserved giving judgment on the case until an unspecified later date.
