The roles played by imprisoned Bernie Madoff's long-time secretary and subordinate staff during his decades-long fraudulent deals and alleged office affairs will soon be revealed in court.

The trial of the Ponzi king's associates - including one of the government's prize witnesses, Frank DiPascali, Madoff's former finance chief - is expected to last up to five months and begins tomorrow in federal court in Manhattan, New York City.

The government will for the first time show a jury what it has collected in its five-year probe of one of history's biggest frauds, which saw Madoff jailed for 150 years for duping thousands of investors out of nearly $20billion since the 1970s.

Office affairs: Details of alleged sexual relationships in Madoff's office are expected to be revealed during the decades-long Ponzi fraud that saw him jailed for 150 years

Details yet to be revealed are of alleged sexual and romantic activities that seemed to permeate Madoff's offices when he was perceived as a high flying Wall Street guru - so smart that he could ensure double-digit returns to his investors even when the economy was flat or in decline.

Pretrial maneuvers included an effort by prosecutors to exclude from evidence any mention of such affairs, but as yet, no decision has been made to block these details.

Prosecutors said in court papers: 'Suffice it to say that the government's investigation has revealed that, over the course of the multi-decade fraud alleged in the indictment, a number of Madoff Securities employees and customers - including expected witnesses, defendants, and others - were engaged in romantic or sexual relationships.'

The government said Madoff himself was engaged in a love triangle with one of the defendants. There are only two female defendants appearing in the trial - staffer Joann Crupi and Madoff's longtime secretary Annette Bongiorno.

U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain, a calm, thoughtful presence on the bench, has not yet said for sure whether the salacious allegations can be aired in the courtroom.

The government is counting on DiPascali to explain to jurors the roles played by each defendant.

Prosecutors say fictitious trades and phantom accounts were created with help from Madoff's secretary, Annette Bongiorno, a supervisor in his private investment business; Daniel Bonventre, his director of operations for investments; JoAnn Crupi, an account manager; and computer programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez. All have pleaded not guilty. Six others have pleaded guilty in the case, including DiPascali.

Amid a collapsing economy, Madoff was forced to reveal his fraud in December 2008, acknowledging that accounts he had told investors were worth nearly $68 billion only days earlier actually held only a few hundred million dollars.

He had lied to thousands of investors, including retirees, charities, school trusts and even Holocaust survivors.

He pleaded guilty to fraud charges a few months later and was sentenced to a 150-year prison term in Butner, N.C. Much of the money has since been recovered by a court-appointed trustee.

Madoff, 75, claimed during his guilty plea that he acted alone, but the government says that was not true and will use the trial to try to prove it.

Details of the lavish lifestyles of Madoff's associates will not be revealed, however, as Judge Swain has excluded much of this evidence, such as Madoff allegedly splashing them with tens of millions of dollars even as the Ponzi scheme grew closer to its abrupt culmination.

Jurors won't hear about Bongiorno's Mercedes or her vacation home or her shopping forays to pricey department stores.

As her lawyers wrote in persuading the judge to exclude personal expenses: 'The government seeks to tap into the public's generalized anger at `Wall Street Greed,' which has the potential to result in an unjust verdict `fabricated' from the jury's emotional response to proof that is not tethered to any element of the charges against Ms. Bongiorno.'

Crupi's lawyers made a similar argument, saying 'whether she purchased a beach house or not, went on vacation or not, bought a deluxe refrigerator or not, proves nothing about what happened ... or what Ms. Crupi knew.'

Assets: After his downfall Madoff had to sell several homes, including his Manhattan penthouse

For sale: The convicted fraudster had to give up his beach house in Montauk, Long Island

Still, the judge is allowing into evidence information about the beach house and a Caribbean vacation for another defendant because Madoff's firm directly helped fund them.

And the first trial may not be the last.

Just days ago, prosecutors charged a 77-year-old accounting executive, saying he directed others since at least the early 1990s to falsify records and help conceal Madoff's fraud. He, too, has pleaded not guilty.Â
