Usain Bolt has provided the Commonwealth Games with a huge boost after the Jamaican sprint sensation confirmed his availability for next month's competition in Glasgow.

The 27-year-old has been struggling with a foot injury and his participation may be limited to the relay, depending on the Jamaican selectors' stance towards Bolt missing the official trial.

There were major doubts over whether Bolt would be fit to compete, with the 100 and 200 metres world record holder pulling out of events in Paris and Ostrava earlier in the season.

He said in a statement on his website: 'I
 am not ready to compete at the Jamaican Championships this weekend but I
 have informed the JAAA’s that I am available for selection for the 
Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and have submitted the relevant 
documentation. 

'I do not 
wish to take the place of anyone who qualifies this weekend in an 
individual event but am available for relay duty if the selectors feel I
 can be an asset to the Jamaican team in Glasgow. 

'I
 have received lots of requests, invitations and messages of support 
from my fans in Scotland who are looking forward to a great event.'

Yohan Blake, Bolt's Jamaican team-mate and rival, last week announced that he will not be competing in the Games.
