Brendan Rodgers believes Liverpool will need another 23 points to reach the Champions League as he insisted sentiment will have no bearing on when he recalls Steven Gerrard.

Liverpool’s influential captain is fit again after recovering from a hamstring problem he sustained on February 10 but there is no guarantee that Rodgers will put him straight back into the starting line-up, as would have been the case during the majority of his career at Anfield.

During Gerrard’s absence, Liverpool won three consecutive Barclays Premier League games against Southampton, Manchester City and Burnley but Rodgers feels that sequence is going to have to continue in what will be a pivotal week for the club, with tonight’s trip to Swansea followed by next Sunday’s showdown with Manchester United.

Gerrard wants to help Liverpool finish in the top four and win the FA Cup before he joins LA Galaxy and while Rodgers is adamant the 34-year-old will have a say on how the campaign maps out, he won’t pick him on reputation alone.

‘We have 30 points to play for, so I am guessing it will be another 23 points,’ said Rodgers. ‘That is how competitive it has been this year. 

'We have won nine out of 11 in January and February, it has been a great run but now we have to be focused on these last 10 matches. Everything counts. 

'We have to be aggressive in our game and now we have to nail it in the last 10. I know the players are focused on that. 

‘Everyone is waiting to see if Stevie comes into the team or not, but it was the same with Daniel. Does he or does he not? What you have seen over my time here is that I rely on the team. 

'The team, of course, has to have good players in it, but ultimately it is about the team and what is going to benefit and how we can get results as a team. 

'I will repeat again the most important thing is Steven is back fit and we have Lucas Leiva coming back too.

‘That will add to the competition for places and with one game a week, barring the Cup game, then everyone is going to be fighting and being competitive about playing.

‘The beauty of this season is that everyone has had an opportunity in the first three or four months of the season and then we have found a way to win. It is something everyone has to respect. It is about the team and the spirit of the team and I will always pick the best team I feel to win a game.’

Rodgers added: ‘He still has big qualities that we will need between now and the end of the season (but) I don’t pick a team on whether I like someone or not. What I do know is that Stevie always puts the team first.’

Raheem Sterling’s future, meanwhile, continues to create background noise but Rodgers maintains the decision to put contract talks on hold until the end of the campaign has nothing to do with finance.

‘I still think he has a lot of development to go and this is the best place for him,’ said Rodgers. ‘It is pretty obvious that this is a great place for him to be and he has said that himself.’
