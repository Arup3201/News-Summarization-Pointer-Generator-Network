Two brothers arrested for the biggest pharmaceutical drug theft in U.S history might have got away with it had one of them not touched a bottle of water at the scene of the crime.

Charged in Florida on Thursday, Amaury Villa, 37 and Amed Villa, 46 are accused of stealing $80 million in drugs from a Connecticut warehouse in an elaborate scheme that could have come straight out of a Hollywood heist movie.

Brought in after a three-year FBI investigation, the crucial piece of evidence was a small bottle of water Amed touched, recovered from the 70,000 square-foot warehouse they robbed in Enfield, Connecticut.

The Cuban citizens, who reside in Miami, were described by the FBI as having run a sophisticated gang of warehouse thieves and truck-hijackers, responsible for millions of dollars worth of stolen goods being transferred across the East Coast and Midwest of the United States.

Prior to March 13, 2010, the Villa brothers and their crew allegedly traveled to Connecticut to spy on the warehouse belonging to pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly according to MSNBC.

And on the evening of March 13 and early morning of March 14 the gang allegedly of cut a hole into the roof of the warehouse and lowered themselves into the building using ropes.

Whilst inside they disabled the security system and over the course of five hours according to federal charges used a forklift to load 49 pallets of pharmaceutical goods into a waiting truck before making their get-away said the Hartford Courant.

Stealing Gemzar, a chemotherapy drug for lung cancer, anti-depressant Prozac, antipsychotic's Zyprexa and Cymbalta, the FBI and state authorities were stunned by the scope of the theft.

'As far as we know, this brazen crime was the biggest theft in the history of Connecticut and the largest theft of pharmaceuticals in the United States,' said Connecticut U.S Attorney David B. Fein.

The cross-state investigation dubbed, 'Operation Southern Hospitality' led to the Villa brothers being charged in Connecticut with theft and conspiracy related to the warehouse robbery.

One of the brothers, Amaury is also charged along with 10 others in Florida with selling and conspiring to sell stolen pharmaceuticals.

And in another related charge, federal authorities in Illinois have accused Amed Villa with the theft of 3,500 cases of cigarettes, which are valued at more than eight million dollars.

'This investigation represents the largest take-down in U.S. history involving cargo theft. The theft involves more than $100 million, including $80 million worth of pharmaceuticals,' said John V. Gillies, Special Agent in Charge for FBI Miami.

Using leased forklift trucks the brothers and their gang loaded 49 pallets of pharmaceutical drugs into a truck before transporting the goods cross country to South Florida

'Todayâ€™s arrests have dealt a major blow to this Miami-based criminal organisation.

'Cargo theft is a growing multi-billion-dollar crime that significantly impacts consumers, local governments, manufacturers, and shipping companies.'

While almost all of the stolen pharmaceutical drugs were recovered from a warehouse in South Florida in October 2011, authorities were still left open-jawed at the audacious operation mounted by the Villa brothers.

The charges against the Villa brothers, which date from March 12 and were unsealed on Thursday, outlined evidence of interstate travel, hotel layovers, equipment and vehicle rentals all related with the warehouse theft.

Federal authorities said the heist was planned over several months.

In January 2010, Amaury made his way from Miami to LaGuardia Airport, rented a car and drove to Connecticut checking into a hotel in Windsor.

The next day, Eli Lilly surveillance 
video recorded him looking through the front door of the Enfield 
warehouse, according to the federal indictment.

The following day, he returned to LaGuardia and took a flight back to Miami.

In February 2010, it is alleged one 
associate of Amaury hired two tractor-trailers from a firm called 
TransUSA Inc and Amaury is a registered agent of the firm.

The day prior to the robbery, Amaury 
again made his way LaGuardia and drove to hotel that he had stayed at 
previously in Windsor.

Security footage at the warehouse from 10:22 and 10:32 p.m. on March 13, 2010 shows images of more individuals.

After 10:30 p.m., people using tools 
purchased earlier that day at a Home Depot in New York made a hole in 
the warehouse's roof and disabled some of the security system, federal 
authorities said.

It is then alleged that over the next five hours, the Villa brothers stole the pharmaceutical goods from the warehouse.

The federal indictment states that 
the thieves left the property at 3.40 a.m and later that morning, Amaury
Villa checked out of his hotel room in Windsor and that his rental car 
passed through the southbound toll on the Whitestone Bridge in New York.

On March 15, he returned to Miami via La Guardia airport.

The Villa brothers both face a 
maximum five years in jail on one count of conspiracy to commit theft 
and four counts of theft from interstate shipment, each of which carries
a maximum of 10 years in prison.

While authorities were initially baffled by the audacious heist, their trail led them to a storage facility in Doral, Florida where they recovered the drugs in October 2011.

Piecing together the strands of their investigation, the arrests of the brothers on Thursday marked three years of FBI work across five different states.
