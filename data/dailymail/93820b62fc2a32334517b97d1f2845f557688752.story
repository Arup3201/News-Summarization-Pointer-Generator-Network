After screaming at her guests to ‘Get the f*** out of my house,’ Ampika storms outside with fellow housewife Leanne Brown. 

She then returns to the women and decides to explain why their family talk got her so upset.

Through her tears, she says: ‘As a child you read Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella - we all got this picture of the beautiful castle, husband and children and I'm never going to get that.

‘I've been a mistress for a number of years - six years.’

After Ampika makes her revelation at a dinner party she is hosting, the women are all shocked at the news.  but Magali Gorre looks the most disgusted and asks if the man is married to someone else already.

The women are all shocked at the news, but Magali Gorre looks the most disgusted and asks if the man is married to someone else already.

Ampika smiles and sways her head, refusing to give an answer as to if her flame is already in a relationship.

Magali can’t hide her disdain from her host and tells her: ‘Well I think it's wrong.’

Ampika tries to defend herself and claims that she is in love with the man she is seeing, but all of the ladies look unconvinced.

Dawn Ward and Leanne both later tells the cameras that they think Ampika was wrong to air her dirty laundry in public.

In a preview to episode three though, seen at the end of tonight's show, Ampika is seen explaining to housewife Tanya that the man she is seeing isn't actually married.

During another part of the programme, the housewives all unite against Queen Bee Dawn Ward.

The ladies are shocked when she reveals she advised one of the members of her daughter’s girl band that she had six weeks to lose weight before they performed at her Crème De La Crème ball, which was aired in the first episode of the series.

She tells the other women: ‘When you're in a girl band where everyone wants to look hot, you have to feel confident.

‘I know one of the girls didn't feel comfortable about the way she looked and I said to her, "You've got six weeks before the ball, what are you going to do about it?"’

Dawn talking to her daughter's girl band, who she is managing. Dawn reveals in the programme she advised one of the members that she had six weeks to lose weight before they performed at her Crème De La Crème ball 

The ladies are horrified at Dawn’s revelation and tell her that she should never tell a young woman to lose weight. 

WAG Tanya Bardsley says: 'You have to be so careful with young girls.’

But luckily for Dawn, the women are distracted after Ampika’s chef brings the main course to the dinner table – a rare fillet of beef each.

Four of the six women are horrified and Dawn even asks for her steak to be taken back to the kitchen and cooked properly, after claiming that it is mooing on her plate. 

Ampika is disgusted with her guests and tells her chef Eddie that the women are all peasants.

Tanya tries her hand at boxing in the programme 

Tanya is unphased by the comments and laughs – she proves herself to be the most down-to-earth of the group in the episode, admitting that she doesn’t send her children to private school because she attended state school as a child.

She also openly reveals to two of the women that she can no longer jump up and down when they are at a boxing lesson together earlier in the day because the motion makes her pass urine.

In the scene, she is dragged by Leanne and Ampika down to a boxing lesson at a gym in Hale and warns the instructor that she won’t be doing much sparring.

She tells him: ‘I don't do jumping because I'll wee myself.

‘Every time I skip - after (having) three kids, I wee myself a bit.’

Real Housewives of Cheshire airs tonight on ITVBe at 10pm.
