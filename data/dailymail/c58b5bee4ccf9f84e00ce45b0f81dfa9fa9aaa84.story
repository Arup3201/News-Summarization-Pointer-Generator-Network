From elaborate hats to colourful coats and skyscraper heels, this week's Cheltenham Festival has proved as memorable for its  fashion as it has for the drama unfolding on the course.

But today, racing fans were left shivering in their flimsy frocks as the heavens opened and gave everyone a soaking. Luckily, most had come prepared with umbrellas, turning the racecourse into a sea of bright colour as the brollies were unfurled.

Beneath them were racegoers dressed in an array of colourful ensembles, with some braving the downpour in bare legs and spike heels while trying desperately to keep their elaborate titfers dry.

Chilly: A couple of ladies chose to brave the cold weather in bare legs and platform shoes, even leaving warm coats at home

Brrrr! Racegoers were left shivering after the heavens opened on the fourth and final day of this year's Cheltenham Festival

Well prepared: Most had come prepared with umbrellas but a few chose to brave the chill in bare legs regardless

Hidden: A lady arrives well wrapped up in a chic green tweed coat but is almost totally obscured behind her umbrella

Watch the hair! Others took shelter beneath large hats but those wearing fascinators had no choice but to carry a brolly

Not put off: It might have been raining but that didn't stop many racegoers from ramping up the glamour in their spike heels

Not impressed: Although some appeared to be enjoying the rain, others - particularly those with suspect brollies - looked less thrilled

Others went down a more practical route, wrapping up in cosy fur coats and oversized hats. More still, perhaps with an eye to the weather rather than fashion, shucked off their finery and replaced it with waterproof cagoules.

Despite the downpours, most of the men and women arriving for the final day of racing action managed to look cheerful - perhaps with the prospect of seeing veteran jockey AP McCoy compete in the final Gold Cup of his career in mind.

McCoy, who has won the prestigious trophy no fewer than five times during his 20-year career, will compete for the final time aboard the hotly-tipped Irish bay gelding, Carlingford Lough.

'It's impossible to not back AP McCoy's last ever ride in the Gold Cup,' comments Ladbroke's Jessica Bridge. 'It would be a fairytale end to a glittering career for the 20-time champion jockey. 

Back again: Zara Tindall returned for the fourth day in a row and looked chic in her brown wool coat by Irish designer, Paul Costelloe

Good look: The Queen's granddaughter opted for a striking Rosie Olivia cocktail hat topped with traditional pheasant feathers

Family outing: Zara was later joined by her mother Princess Anne and her husband Mike Tindall

Day out: A beaming Strictly Come Dancing star Ola Jordan arrived hand-in-hand with husband James

'Silviniaco Conti might be the heavily backed favourite, yet there's still question marks whether he can finally make it third time lucky at Cheltenham, but for the old romantics there's only one man that can win this year's Gold Cup, and it's AP McCoy.'

Also on hand to see McCoy compete in his final Gold Cup was Zara Tindall who arrived looking glamorous in a brown wool coat by Irish designer Paul Costelloe and sporting a chic cocktail hat decorated with traditional pheasant feathers.

Zara's appearance made it a full four out of four for the Queen's granddaughter, who made her first visit to the racecourse on Tuesday where she saw her and husband Mike's horse Monbeg Dude fail to deliver and take a lowly 14th place in his race.

She reappeared for a second time on Ladies' Day and opted for another Costelloe ensemble, this time a black and grey checked coat and a detailed black cocktail hat.

For the second day in a row, she spent most of her time watching the action unfold from the grandstand and chose not to join her aunt, the Duchess of Cornwall, in her private box.

Today saw Zara joined for the event by her mother Princess Anne, who arrived in the early afternoon having come direct from a service held to honour the fallen of Afghanistan at St. Paul's Cathedral.
