A lawyer for a man fired from his job after being 
accused of slapping a baby and using a racial slur on an airplane denied
on Monday he was a racist and said she was getting hate mail over the 
assault case.

Joe Rickey Hundley of Hayden, Idaho
plans to plead not guilty to federal assault charges stemming from the 
February 8 incident in which he is accused of striking in the face a 
19-month-old boy on board a Delta Air Lines flight, said his lawyer Marcia Shein.

After saying 
publicly that Hundley intended to enter a plea of not guilty, his 
attorney said: 'I'm getting hate mail.'

Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land

Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that n****r baby up'

Accused: Joe Rickey Hundley is accused of first racially abusing, then physically assaulting 19-month old Jonah Bennett

The not-guilty plea is part of the initial legal 
process, and there is much more to the story that will be revealed 
later, Shein said.

'It's a process you have to go through but when you tell the public that, they just think you're nuts,' she said.

'He is not a racist,' she added of her client. 'I'm 
going to make that real clear because that's what people are suggesting.

'There's background information people don't know about, and in time it will come out.'

'I'm sorry the family is upset,' the attorney added. 'I can understand why they would be.'

Mother Jessica Bennett, 33, said she 
was scared to death as a ‘drunk’ fellow passenger slapped her son after 
spouting off a racial slur.

Suspicious: Bennett said Jonah no longer trusts strangers after being struck

Bennett was aboard the Delta flight 
from Minnesota to Atlanta with her adopted son Jonah on February 8 when 
the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears.'

She said she was shocked to hear the man seated next to her, Hundley, demand that she 'shut that n****r baby up.'

She told ABC News: 'I said, "What did you just say?" And he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to my ear and he said it directly into my ear.'

But she couldn't have imagined what happened next, as Hundley allegedly slapped Jonah.

When I looked at Jonah’s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death.'

Bennett, of Minneapolis, Minnesota, says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since.

Shein, told ABC News that no one should rush to judgment in her client's case, and he will be pleading not guilty.

But the task of proving his innocence may be difficult as Bennett family attorney John Thompson told the network that there were numerous witnesses who saw Hundley strike Jonah - including a federal air marshal.

According to The Smoking Gun, Hundley has been charged with simple assault after the incident.

Hundley was charged with simple 
assault in federal court in Atlanta last week. If convicted, he faces a maximum of one year in prison.

The 60-year-old, who is the president of an aircraft parts manufacturer based in
Idaho, denied slapping the child or using racial language. He claims 
that he did 'ask the mother to quiet the child.'

Hundley was fired from his job as president of Unitech Composites and Structures, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Al Haase, president and chief 
executive of AGC Aerospace and Defense, Composites Group - Unitech's 
parent company - said the firm was taking the matter seriously.

'In accordance with our company's 
personal conduct policy, we have suspended the employee pending 
investigation,' Al Haase, president and CEO of AGC, said in a statement.

'We wish to emphasize that the behavior that
has been described is contradictory to our values, embarrassing and 
does not in any way reflect the patriotic character of the men and women
of diverse backgrounds who work tirelessly in our business,' Haase added.

Shein believed it was unlikely Hundley would be able to successfully fight for his job back.

Hundley said he was traveling to Atlanta to visit a 
hospitalized relative, described his emotional state as 'distraught' and that he had one alcoholic drink on the aircraft.

However,
Bennett told The Smoking Gun that she believed Hundley was intoxicated.
The mother said that he 'reeked of alcohol', was 'stumbling around 
wasted' and he consumed several double vodkas during the flight.

Bennett says Hundley told her that Jonah was too big to be a 'lap baby.'

Agent Cheney added that Bennett 
received help from other passengers on the Delta flight.

Todd Wooten, 
who was seated 12 rows ahead, told authorities that he 'heard derogatory
language coming from the rear of the aircraft' and went to see what was
going on.

'According to Mr. Wooten,' Cheney wrote, 'he saw Joe Rickey Hundley strike' the child.

Hundley pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in 
2007 after he was arrested following a quarrel with his girlfriend.

He was first charged with simple assault, carrying a concealed weapon, and public intoxication. Hundley told The Smoking Gun that the weapon he was allegedly carrying was a corkscrew.

Final approach: The aircraft was about to land at Atlanta airport, pictured, when the child started to cry
