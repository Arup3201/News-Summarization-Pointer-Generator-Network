Coldpay's second album has been named the favourite of all time by Radio 2 listeners.

A Rush Of Blood To The Head triumphed in a poll which saw perennial favourites The Beatles score a highest placing of just number eight.

The top album was revealed yesterday by DJ Jo Whiley following a countdown of the 100 favourites throughout the day, starting in the early hours.

Coldplay’s winning album – which features hits such as Clocks, In My Place and The Scientist – was released in 2002 and topped the charts, going on to sell more than  2.8million copies in the UK.

Runner-up Hopes And Fears by Keane, which like the Coldplay release is piano-heavy, was the mostrecent album in the top ten, dating from 2004. Duran Duran’s Rio came third.

The poll was held to tie in with the  recent BBC season The Golden Age of the Album.

Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles – often viewed as one of the greatest and most influential albums ever made – took eighth spot.

A number of other classics figured highly  in the list. Pink Floyd’s Dark Side Of The Moon, released 40 years ago, was fourth and Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones was in sixth place.

Radio 2 head of music Jeff Smith said: ‘With albums ranging from Sinatra in the Fifties to Emeli Sande in the last year, the range of eras and genres exhibited by the chart is typical of the breadth of Radio 2 and its distinctive music policy.

‘Musicians such as Coldplay and Dido have struck a chord with listeners and are in good company in the top ten alongside legendary bands like The Rolling Stones and The Beatles, whose appeal remains undiminished after all these years.’
