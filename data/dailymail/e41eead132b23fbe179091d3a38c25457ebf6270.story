Kathleen Stimon revealed that she has suffered cyber-bulling by her husband since he was imprisoned in January

Kathleen Stimon, a school librarian in New Hampshire, has been married to Bruce Stimon, 47, for 22 years

‘I told him I didn't 
think I could be married to him anymore, that I wanted a divorce,’ she told ABC's 20/20.

Angered by his wife's response, Bruce Stimon began to terrorize her via the internet.

‘He shut off the utilities going in our house... my house, and our child's house,’ she said.

‘He took over anything he could 
online... my Facebook, my eBay, my PayPal. I thought I was safe because
he was in prison. I didn't think he was capable of doing anything 
during that time.’

She also received 
another unwanted surprise, a $50,000 bills for charges including
travel to see Hicks and gifts he gave Hicks during their romance - 
flowers, chocolates, lingerie and an iPhone he used to track Soraida 
Hicks' every move.

Bruce Stimon was sentenced to three years in January for stalking, identity theft and extortion. He sent nude photographs of Hicks to her co-workers and her daughter's friends and the harassment meant she lost her job in a bank and was forced her to change her name.

Kathleen Stimon says she was horrified when she found out about her husband's affair and his reign of cyber terror on Soraida Hicks.

‘The things he did to her, hour and hours of plotting and planning, were very devious, very ugly,’ she said. ‘And when you involve somebody's child, I mean, it's the lowest thing you do. It's just despicable.’

Soraida Hicks, 32, says didn't know Stimon was married when he harassed her. She is now suing him for $20 million after he posted photographs of her and her teenage daughter onto prostitution websites and then directed men to her home.

She told 20/20 that she is still afraid of what he might do to her. 

'I'm afraid that he's going to pay someone to kill me,' Hicks said.

Soraida Hicks and her daughter Pam were subjected to almost a year of cyber attacks and harassment by Hicks' ex-boyfriend Bruce Stimon

Arlington resident Hicks, met Stimon on a plane traveling from Boston to Washington in the fall of 2011.

The two started up a long-distance 
relationship and Stimon began to buy Hicks expensive gifts, including an
iPhone which he paid for on his own family plan.

However, the systematic abuse began when Stimon used the iPhone as a way to gain access to Hicks' emails and calls and began to send offensive messages from her number.

'He sent a message to people saying that I have an STD,' said Hicks, who quickly figured out that it was Stimon and then ended the relationship.

However, in January 2012, the level of Stimon's intrusion into her life was revealed when she learned he had 'created a web site advertising her services as a prostitute according to the lawsuit filed.

Stimon had posted Hicks' name, address and explicit photographs and listed her work supervisor as her point of contact. Stimon is also alleged to have uploaded online pornographic films he had made of the two without Hicks' knowledge.

Because of the cyber attack, men began to call her boss at the bank asking if she was available as a prostitute and because of this she was subsequently fired.

And then in a shocking escalation, Stimon sent a video of Hicks and himself to all of her daughter's friends Twitter accounts.

'It was devastating,' Pam said. 'I would go into the bathroom stall and just cry and would come back to class and act like everything was okay.'

'Everyone was asking me, 'oh, is your mom a porn star?' And I am like, no.'

Then, Stimon allegedly used porn sites to list 'mother and daughter' for sex and through a text messaging system sent potential clients to the women's home.

Around 60 men arrived looking for sex, but Arlington Police said that since Stimon was operating his vicious scheme from Boston, it was out of their jurisdiction.

'From January to probably about March, we were just trying to compile information and figure out what was going on,' said Detective Angela Comer of the Arlington County Police Department.

'The commonwealth attorneys, the tactical unit, just about every unit in our department had a hand on this case.'

The case came to a head when Stimson eventually left Massachusetts and came to Hicks' home and slashed her tires.

With surveillance officers watching the home, Arlington Police caught him with a knife in his hand and laptops full of evidence.

He was arrested and pleaded guilty.

'I cannot describe the happiness,' said Pam. 'It feels like a big relief.'

Soraida Hicks has since tried to have the sex tape taken 
off the internet, but authorities say once a video like that is posted 
in multiple places, it can be nearly impossible - and very costly - to
take down.
