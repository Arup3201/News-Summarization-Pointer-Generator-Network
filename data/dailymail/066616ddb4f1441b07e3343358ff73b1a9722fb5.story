Rangers striker Kris Boyd admitted he would be prepared to play for free if the financial crisis at Ibrox escalates.

The Glasgow giants will learn on Tuesday whether they will be allowed to appeal last Friday’s decision at the Court of Session that saw former director Imran Ahmad succeed in freezing £620,000 of the club’s cash.

Ruling in Ahmad’s favour, Lord Stewart declared there to be a ‘risk of Rangers becoming insolvent’ for the second time in just two years with the Championship side only currently having £1.2million in the bank.

Boyd turned his back on offers from Scottish Premiership clubs Aberdeen and Dundee United to step down a division with Rangers in the summer after leaving Kilmarnock.

But with cash in the bank from lucrative moves to Middlesbrough, Turkey and the United States, the 31-year-old star striker insists money was not his motivation for re-joining the Ibrox men.

Boyd said: I’d have walked through those doors for nothing because I was so desperate to play for this club. I wanted the jersey back on.

‘I don’t want to sound smart — or ignorant — but whatever I earn between now and the end of my career is not going to change the way I live.

‘I have managed my finances over the past few years to get what I hope for me and my family going forward is correct.

‘So whatever I do between now and (the end of my career) it’s just about getting myself back enjoying the game.

‘I started off as a young kid going on to a football field and scoring goals. I did that last year at Kilmarnock.

‘Did I ask for assurances about the state of Rangers before I signed? You can sit here and talk about assurances but I just want to do the same as I did at Kilmarnock last season and make up for lost time.’

Rangers need their forthcoming £4m ‘open’ share offer to be fully subscribed to enable them to pay player and staff wages, which fall due on the last Thursday of this month. On top of that, they still owe £1.5m in loans to Sandy Easdale and George Letham, debts that were originally due to have been paid off by the end of August.

The club also seem likely now to bring forward an EGM designed to seek permission for a larger scale share issue, which could allow prospective investors Mike Ashley or Dave King to plough much-needed funds into the club.

Almost 500 Rangers fans have signed up to a scheme seeking to buy a controlling stake in the club since the share issue was launched last month.

Backed by Supporters Direct Scotland, fans’ group Rangers First have set up a similar scheme to the one used to rescue Hearts from their administration battle.

They now say that have seen the number of members volunteering monthly donations rise to over 1,400.

At current totals, the scheme is pulling in almost £32,500 a month and organisers have now revealed they will use some of that income to take part in this month’s open offer.
