Host commentator

And that's the final whistle at Upton Park as a Lionel Messi penalty hands Argentina victory against a spirited Croatia side. 

91mins: Messi hits a 60-yard crossfield ball which Lamela collects, but a poor ball from the Spurs man see Croatia play the ball to safety.

88mins: Just a couple of minutes left at Upton Park as Argentina look set to stroll to victory. 

Perez swings in a corner which is eventually cleared before Tevez fouls Leovac to relieve the pressure. There will be three minutes so injury time. 

 It's all over in Amsterdam as Vela returns from international exile with a brilliant double. Manchester United midfielder Blind also found the net after a stunning volley from Sneijder. 

79mins: Messi's right-footed shot skims of the post after Pereira jinked through the Croatian defence. Unlucky. 

Half-time substitute Lukaku fires home a tap-in after good work from Mertens.

57mins: Tevez hasn't taken long to get into the game and has already stung the hands of Kalinic. The crowd have been cheering every time he gets the ball. 

Sami Mokbel: PA announcer has just described Tevez as a 'West Ham legend' #really?

The Upton Park faithful are on their feet as former West Ham striker Carlos Tevez enters the action. He replaces Aguero. 

You just can't keep him quiet can you? Aguero is brought down by the Croatia keeper and the diminutive forward steps up to sweep the penalty home. 

Sami Mokbel: Second biggest cheer of the night has just happened. Carlos Tevez has just started his warm-up.

All is forgiven in Mexico! Vela scores again in Amsterdam to put his side back in the lead. 

Aguero will claim it after Ansaldi's 25-yard strike deflects off the City forward.  

Croatia get the game back underway in east London. 

The players are back on the pitch for the second half at Upton Park. The good news for neutral fans is that Messi will not be substituted just yet...

Does he ever score a bad goal? Sneijder has just volleyed his team level with a strike to match Vela's opener.  

Adnan Januzaj produced a fantastic assist to set up a Lombaerts goal only for the opener to be cancelled out just minutes later. 

40mins: Messi eludes several challenges before a Perez cross is too long. Argentina have had most of the possession in this first half, but it's Croatia who have the goal. 

34mins: A deep cross from Di Maria finds Ansaldi but his header is cleared. Just minuted later, Messi almost pulls Argentina level after a neat one-two with Ansaldi found the Barca star in space.

Unfortunately, for perhaps everyone at Upton Park, Messi's shot hits the side-netting. 

27mins: Messi and Aguero combine brilliantly on the edge of Croatia's box, but the assistant referee raises his flag just as the Manchester City striker curls a shot wide of goal. 

19mins: Croatia are the team in control and have limited Argentina to shots from distance so far. 

Speaking of shots from distance, Aguero has just fired a brilliant 25-yard strike towards Kalinic's goal before Di Maria does exactly the same thing. The 6ft 7in keeper saves them both. 

Well the fans at Upton Park won't have expected that! It's Croatia that take the lead after a fine finish from Sharbini. 

5mins: Five minutes in and Messi gets his first touches on the ball and you can hear the Upton Park crowd gasp in anticipation. The Barca forward picked up the ball on the edge of the Croatia box before over-hitting his pass. 

3mins: Croatia start well and earn an early corner which is eventually cleared. Antolic picked up the loose ball and bombed down the right before seeing his cross cleared. 

We're underway at Upton Park and it's Argentina who start with the ball all in blue. 

That is a remarkable strike for the former Arsenal forward. It's been four years and five months since his last international goal and what a goal it was. 

Vela found space in the middle of the pitch before he rifled the ball home from 30-yards out with that brilliant left foot. 

5mins: Mexico have started on the front-foot in Holland as Depay fouls Hernandez to give the away side a chance to swing in a free-kick. Vlaar cleared well. 

Chelsea winger Willian gets in on the act after a driving Neymar run caused panic in the Turkey defence - the ball eventually dribbled back to Willian who guided a low shot into the net. 

42mins: Back in Istanbul and Brazil are looking extremely comfortable and lead by two goals. A curling effort from Turan is about as good as it's got for the Crescent-stars as Neymar and Co threaten to run riot. 

Messi, Di Maria and Aguero all start for Argentina at Upton Park and Tevez has to settle for a place on the bench. 

Argentina team vs Croatia: Romero; Zabaleta, Fazio, Vergini, Ansaldi; Perez, Mascherano, Banega; Messi, Aguero, Di Maria

28mins: Alves pulls off a brilliant save from a curling Turan strike which looked destined for the top corner. 

The home side have rarely look like threatening, but that was a chance.  

Norway: Nyland, Elabdellaoui, Nordtveit, Forren, Hogli, Skjelbred, Konradsen, Daehli, Johansen, Elyounoussi, Nielsen.

Referee: Martin Hansson (Sweden)

Unfortunately, Adriano is made to wait for his debut goal as the goal is given to Turkey defender Semih Kaya, who turned Willian's cross into his own net.  

Brazil double their lead and it's debutant Adriano who finds the net. 

We have a first goal of the evening and it's Neymar who puts Brazil ahead. The Barcelona forward found himself one on one with Demirel and finished with ease despite some pressure from the last defender. 

Holland team to play Mexico: Krul, VanRhijn, Veltman, Vlaar, Willems, Afellay, Sneijder, Blind, Robben, Huntelaar, Depay

Mexico team to play Holland: Ochoa, Aguilar, Reyes, M.Herrera, Alanis, Aldrete, Vazquez, H.Herrera, Guardado, Vela, Hernandez

13mins: Bekir whips in a dangerous cross as Turkey start to impose themselves slightly, but Filipe Luis is able to get a strong header on the ball to clear. 

9mins: Chelsea midfielder Oscar looks to have carried his Premier League form with him to Istanbul and has just been involved in Brazil's best move of the game.

He played a neat one-two with Neymar in the centre of the pitch before cutting in and firing a powerful shot towards Volkan Demirel who saved well. 

5mins: Turkey's first attack comes after a brilliant run for Hamit on the right, who jinked inside Filipe Luis before seeing the ball run into Diego Alves's arms. 

3mins: Willian has been in the thick of the action already, drawing a couple of fouls early on as his looks to cut inside. 

Brazil, as you'd expect have been in total control so far...

We're underway in Istanbul as Turkey look to claim a famous result against Dunga's Brazil.

Brazil, in yellow and blue, get us underway.

Lionel Messi warmed up for Wednesday's clash against Croatia in a training ground game against West Ham's Under 21 side.

But the elements battered the Barcelona superstar as a strong Argentina side were put through their paces at the Hammers' wet and windy Rush Green Academy base in Essex on Tuesday evening.

A large gathering of local schoolchildren waited for an hour outside the club's gates to catch a glimpse of their hero. They screamed hysterically when the team bus eventually arrived as Messi fever gripped the East End... Click here to read more
