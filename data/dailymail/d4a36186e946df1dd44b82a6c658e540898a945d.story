Today's christening of Prince William and Kate Middleton's son Prince George was both a private family occasion and a historic event.

The ceremony at St James's Palace was the first baptism of an heir to the throne in 31 years.

As a future King, George Alexander Louis's baptism in the 
little known Chapel Royal was performed by 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's baby was welcomed into the Christian faith surrounded by his immediate family and the close friends of his parents, including six godparents.

Christenings are the one royal occasion that are conducted in private, often lending themselves to unusually candid and tender images of the Royal family.

Here, we celebrate this century's Royal christenings in pictures.
