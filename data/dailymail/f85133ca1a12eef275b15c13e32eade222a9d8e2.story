The entry-level phone is the first Windows Phone from Nokia in the U.S. and is targeted at the 150 million Americans who have yet to make the transition to smartphones

It's a pairing of two also-rans - Nokia, the Finnish phone company whose phones have lost market share to rivals such as Apple and HTC, and T-Mobile, the no. 4 U.S. mobile service.

But Nokia's 'starter' smartphone, Lumia 710, might have the secret sauce required for succces - it's just $50.

It's aimed at the 150 million Americans who have yet to use touchscreen 'smartphones' such as iPhone.

Nokia's 'comeback' phone - running Microsoft's colourful, simple Windows Phone software - will launch in the U.S. on January 11, exclusive to T-Mobile.

It has a 3.7-inch colour touchscreen and five-megapixel camera - which puts it behind technology leaders such as iPhone 4S and Samsung's Galaxy S2.

But it offers internet, email and downloadable apps, just like its rivals - and also Angry Birds.

The phone will miss the crucial holiday sales season, though.

It's the first Nokia smartphone running Windows in the U.S. Windows Mobile has also failed to make a dent in the market so far - analysts Gartner said that the software only accounted for 1.6 per cent of the market worldwide earlier this year.

It's a make-or-break launch for both Nokia and Microsoft - and aimed squarely at first-time smartphone buyers.

Nokia's Lumia 710 will be available on T-Mobile's 4G network on January 11 next year - priced at just $50, and aimed at the 150 million Americans who don't use smartphones such as iPhone

The $49.99 price could be crucial in luring some of the 150 million U.S consumers who still use more basic phones.

But Nokia needs to convince bigger national operators to carry its handsets if it wants to be back in the game.

Nokia’s share of the U.S. smartphone market will be around 1 percent in 2011, according to Strategy Analytics analyst Neil Mawston. 

Nokia had promised in October that it was regaining U.S. operator support and would have a portfolio of new products for the U.S. market starting early 2012.   

Nokia Lumia 710 will offer hi-tech features such as apps, mapping, email and internet at a much lower price than rivals such as Apple's iPhone 4S

Chris Weber, the head of Nokia’s U.S. business, said the company would push hard to give operators a reason to carry Nokia devices. 

Since T-Mobile USA is the smallest of the national U.S. operators, Nokia investors will be anxious to hear when it expects to sell the smartphones with the bigger carriers like Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc and Sprint Nextel.     'We’ll have a full portfolio with multiple operators,' in the U.S. market in 2012, Weber promised.
