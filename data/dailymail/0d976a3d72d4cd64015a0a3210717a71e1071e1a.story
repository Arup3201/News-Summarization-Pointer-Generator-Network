The new girlfriend of a Washington man accused of bludgeoning to death his estranged wife gave a bizarre interview to a local TV station conceding he could be guilty.

Alan Smith has been named a suspect in the brutal murder of Susann Smith in her Bothell, Washington home, in February.

While Smith's new girlfriend of just over a month, Love Thai, stands by him, she made a startling admission to KOMO-TV in a recent sit-down interview about the possibility of Smith's guilt. 

'You know everyone has their breakdown,' she said.

'I don't know what his threshold is, but is the possibility and the capability there? Yeah.'

Murder suspect Alan Smith, 37, turned in his passport, posted bond Saturday night and got out of the Snohomish County Jail, early Sunday morning

Smith has long been a person of interest in his estranged wife's death, but he has not been charged with a crime relating to her death.

Susann Smith, 37, was found murdered in her home on February 12 with defensive wounds on her hands and arms, a fractured skull, 19 separate blunt force strikes and stab wounds to her face and hands, court documents state.

She had to be identified by her dental records.

Alan Smith now shares that home with Love Thai.

In a sit-down interview with KOMO-TV hours before he was arrested on Thursday, a barefoot Smith said he once loved Susann.

'She was the love of my life for a while and the mother of my children, and my heart breaks,' he said.

At the time of the murder, the pair were embroiled in a bitter custody dispute over their two children who are now in state custody.

ABC News reports police charged Smith with obstructing an officer Thursday in his Bothell home after they were unable to find his passport and he failed to turn it over in the murder investigation.

Smith posted bond Saturday and was released from Snohomish County Jail early Sunday morning.

He has now turned in his passport. Police believe he is a flight risk.

In
court documents, detectives say Smith had been looking into plane 
tickets to Venezuela around the time of the killing and checking Google 
for phrases such as 'Will Venezuela extradite to the U.S.?'

Detectives
say Smith had been purchasing 'disposable coveralls and masking tape' 
from Home Depot around the same time of the slaying.

Lab technicians also found traces of blood on his SUV's steering wheel, center console and floor mat, and records show he had purchased disposable coveralls, shoe covers and a rubber mallet before the murder.

According to search warrant documents, Mr Smith had also discussed how to kill his estranged wife with an ex-girlfriend.

Police planned to take Alan Smith’s footprint and compare it to footprints found at the scene of the crime.

Police have been called to the Bothell home a couple of times in the past month after complaints from neighbors.

On June 17, officers found Smith and his girlfriend having sex in the yard, Collins said. Police talked to them but did not have cause for an arrest.

Love Thai explained to KOMO News what happened: 'The story is we were there in the corner making sweet love. I said, "Hey, you came into our private yard".

'The cop let us know that a neighbor reported that they saw sexual activity and I looked through and I said, "Ok we're really sorry".

'If you're going to look into someone's private property and get upset about it, take ownership of that. But for you to call police is not OK.'
