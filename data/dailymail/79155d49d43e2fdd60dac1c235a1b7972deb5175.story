England twice surrendered the initiative and ultimately had to settle for a draw in their Under 20 international with Canada at Bournemouth on Wednesday night.

Aidy Bothroyd's team twice led in the contest, firstly through Arsenal's Chuba Akpom and then, with only five minutes left at the Goldsands Stadium, through local boy Baily Cargill.

But Canada had an answer to the Young Lions, equalising initially through Michael Petrasso shortly after half-time and then claiming a share of the spoils in stoppage time through Jordan Hamilton.

The result meant England remain unbeaten under Boothroyd but there will be slight disappointment that they couldn't hang on.

Since the former Watford manager was appointed, England have beaten Romania 6-0 and won a Four Nations tournament also involving Germany, Holland and Turkey last month.

Boothroyd named a mixture of establish youth internationals and debutants, one of whom was Bournemouth defender Cargill, who understandably received a warm welcome from the near-7,000 crowd.

The visiting Canucks gave England an early fright when Manny Aparicio darted through the England back line, only to fire off a tame shot that presented no problem for Exeter keeper Christy Pym.

England soon found their stride and took the lead on the quarter-hour. Captain Lewis Baker's cross was only partially cleared to his Chelsea team-mate John Swift on the edge of the box.

He lined up to shoot but feinted and returned it to Baker, whose cross was headed home by Akpom.

The Arsenal frontman saw a couple of other chances go begging before half-time as England continued to press, including a header that flashed inches wide of the post.

Despite a defensive reshuffle to compensate for the loss of Liverpool's Lloyd Jones to injury, England continued to press after the break and Southampton man Harrison Reed forced a finger-tip save from Marco Carducci.

But Canada left the hosts stunned when QPR winger Petrasso ran half the length of the field to fire home and equalise on 48 minutes.

Boothroyd, who had fielded an attack-minded 4-3-3 formation, further strengthened his forward line by introducing Josh Murphy, Jordon Ibe, James Wilson and Kwame Thomas in the second half.

But in the end it was Cargill, a defender, who restored their lead with a thumping header just five minutes from the end.

It looked as though England would claim a deserved victory but, in stoppage time, Pym failed to collect a free-kick from Hanson Boakal and Hamilton was left to fire into an empty net.

England have a quick opportunity to make amends when they travel to Coimbra to take on Portugal on Monday.
