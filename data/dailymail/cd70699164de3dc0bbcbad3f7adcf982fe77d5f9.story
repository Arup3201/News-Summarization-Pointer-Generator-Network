An Australian couple have allegedly left Thailand with their newborn twins, born last month via surrogate, according to ABC NewsRadio.

The report says that the same-sex couple are already in Singapore with their babies.

The news come after couples from the US and Australia, who were flying out with surrogate babies, have been barred from travel by immigration officials in Thailand, as its local government continues its crackdown on surrogacy laws.

A spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) tells Daily Mail Australia, 'The Australian Embassy in Bangkok is currently assisting Australians with children born by surrogacy in Thailand who have been prevented from departing the country in recent days.

DFAT warns that the new protocols in place by the Thai authorities will affect all Australians travelling to Thailand.

'The Australian Government's Smarttraveller travel advice for Thailand was updated on 14 August to advise that Thai authorities are enforcing strict documentation requirements upon exit of the country when they suspect a child has been born by surrogracy in Thailand,' said a DFAT spokesperson.

The alleged abandonment of baby Gammy - a child carried by surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua (pictured with the seven-month-old - sparked a surrogacy crackdown in Thailand

It is believed the couples, including the Australia were leaving from Bangkok international airport when they were stopped on Thursday afternoon, according to the ABC.

One of the couples was with a surrogate mother.

This discovery came after two American couples were also stopped for the same thing in the past 24 hours.

An Australian couple were also sent home from Bangkok on Sunday when they tried to leave the country with a baby born via a surrogate mother, Fairfax Media reported.

Unless a court order directs otherwise, immigration officials have the authority to stop surrogate babies leaving the country.

'While regulation of surrogacy is a matter for Thailand, we continue to encourage Thai authorities to adopt transitional arrangements for any new measures they may introduce, so concerned Australians are not unduly affected,' said the spokesperson for DFAT.

Consular assistance is available to Australians affected in Thailand by contacting the Australian Embassy in Bangkok or DFAT's Consular Emergency Centre.

Thailand's new government looks to push through legislation looking at halting commercial surrogacy.

Wendy and David Farnell, from Western Australia, were accused of abandoning Gammy and taking only his twin sister, Pipah, when they found out he had Down syndrome

Members of the Thai parliament are from the militia and its army general is trying to prevent Thailand from becoming a surrogacy hotbed for overseas couples by criminalising it.

The country's sudden crackdown on the industry was sparked by an Australian couple who caused international outcry when they were accused of leaving behind a Thai-born baby named Gammy when they found out he had Down syndrome, instead taking his twin sister home with them.

Gammy's surrogate mother, Pattaramon Chanbua, was the one who levelled the accusations at Western Australian couple David and Wendy Farnell.

In another twist in the story, it emerged David Farnell had been convicted of 22 child sex offences - including a victim aged just seven - in his 20s.

The couple appeared on 60 Minutes on Sunday to hit back at the claims made by Ms Pattaramon, 21

Farnell was sentenced to three years jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls in 'secretive meetings' in his shed or house, in 1982 and 1983, when the girls were aged seven and 10.

The couple hid their home for a week while media was camped outside and Western Australian government officials from the Department of Child Protection sought them out for a meeting after the news of Farnell's past surfaced.

David and Wendy Farnell appeared on Channel Nine's 60 Minutes on Sunday to hit back at reports circulating they had abandoned Gammy.

'It's been very stressing. We miss our little boy. I come home from work some days and Wendy has dressed our little girl (Gammy's twin sister Pipah) all in blue because she wants to remember the little boy,' Farnell told the news program.

'We said we want both babies to be born and we will think about this.'
