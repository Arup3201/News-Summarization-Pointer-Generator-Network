Infection control: Doctors wash their hands less often as they get more tired, meaning there is greater risk of spreading infection, a study warns

Doctors and nurses wash their hands less often as their shift progresses, increasing the risk they will spread infections among their patients, a study warns.

The demands placed on medics and carers by long shifts drained their mental reserves and led to them washing their hands less often as their days wore on, researchers found.

Tired and busy staff concentrate on their medical duties and see hand hygiene as a 'low priority'. And the more stress and workload, the less compliance with the rules.

Despite strict guidelines to stop bugs spreading, one in 16 people treated in an NHS hospital picks up an infection such as MRSA, according to the latest figures from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

Hengchen Dai, of the University of Pennsylvania, said: 'Just as the repeated exercise of muscles leads to physical fatigue, repeated use of executive resources produces a decline in an individual's self-regulatory capacity.

'Demanding jobs have the potential to energise employees, but the pressure may make them focus more on maintaining performance on their primary tasks, for example, patient assessment and medication distribution, particularly when they are fatigued.

'For hospital caregivers, hand-washing may be viewed as a lower-priority task and thus it appears compliance with hand hygiene guidelines suffers as the workday progresses.'

Mr Dai and his team looked at three years of hand-washing data from 4,157 caregivers in 35 U.S. hospitals.

In the study published by the American Psychologican Association, nurses accounted for 65 per cent of the sample, nursing assistants 12 per cent, therapists 7 per cent, doctors 4 per cent and the rest other hospital workers.

It found compliance with handwashing rules dropped by an average of 8.7 per cent during a typical 12-hour shift.

However if longer breaks broke up the shift hand-washing protocols were followed more carefully on when staff returned.

A previous study in Switzerland has shown hand-washing in hospitals can reduce infections by 3.9 per 1,000 patients. Another shows the cost per patient with a healthcare-acquired infection is £12,966.

Through using this data, the researchers concluded that there would be an additional 600,000 infections per year at a cost of approximately £12.5billion annually to U.S. hospitals alone.

The human hand harbours more harmful bacteria than public surfaces, a recent study found.

Researchers found the average pair of human hands is more unhygienic than escalators and benches in busy shopping centres and parks.

Yet only one in eight people always wash their hands before eating, the study shows.

The average person carries more than 10 million bacteria on the hands alone and a University of Arizona study found a typical kitchen sponge will contain several million.

Under NHS guidelines introduced to all clinical staff, they should clean their hands thoroughly with either soap and water or an alcohol-based handrub, both immediately before and immediately after coming into contact with a patient - even after wearing gloves.

NICE said hand hygiene in NHS hospitals has improved in recent years but good practice is still not universal.

Co-researcher Dr Katherine Milkman, said: 'We believe ours is the first study investigating whether accumulated work demands can affect rule compliance over the course of a single workday, as opposed to over weeks, months or years.

'We think this line of research could be applied to other types of workplace compliance, such as ethics standards in banking, safe driving behaviours in trucking and safety standards in manufacturing.'
