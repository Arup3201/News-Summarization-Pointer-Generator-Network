Hundreds of dolphins are seen diving through the sparkling waters as they migrate along the Eastern Cape of South Africa.

On the last leg of their annual 6,000mile migration, the dolphins can be seen joyfully breaking the surface, and jumping across the waves off the coast of Port Alfred.

The migration saw the dolphins move from Mossel Bay on the south coast of South Africa along the Tsitiskamma Landscapes up though Algoa Bay to Port Alfred on the east coast.

Long journey home: Thousands of migrating dolphins reach Port Alfred on their trip along the Eastern Cape of South Africa

Moving on: Coastal dolphins, such as these, are known to stay closer to the coastline and therefore do not travel as far as off shore dolphins, who prefer to live further out

Moving down the line: The large pod's migration has taken them from Mossel Bay on the south coast of South Africa, along the Tsitiskamma Landscapes, up though Algoa Bay to Port Alfred on the east coast

Photographer couple Silke and Rainer 
Schimpf followed the dolphins for seven months – from February to August
 - before they found the perfect conditions in Port Alfred, having spent a
 total of 440 hours and travelled 6,060miles on sea.

Silke said: ‘It suddenly all came into place.

‘We
 found the common dolphins close to the river and followed them out at 
sea for about 30 km, the light was perfect and the dolphins played 
along.

‘I love seeing them 'bow riding', breaching next to the boat, just for fun, and hunting fish.

‘Here and there we can spot a humpback whale - these animals live a life of paradise.’

Jump for joy: The dolphins migrate with the seasons and often travel in pods of up to 30 individuals

Catching a ride: The dolphins are not the only animals moving along the South African coastline, birds also follow in their wake

Dedication: Photographers Silke and Rainer Schimpf followed the dolphins for seven months - from February until August - before shooting the spectacular images

Absolute prefection: In order to find the perfect conditions to shoot the dolphins The Schimpfs spent a total of 440 hours and travelled more than 6,000 miles on sea

Onwards and upwards: Some of the dolphins breaks the surface inn a jump in the afternoon sun off the coast of the Eastern Cape near Post Alfred

A skip and a hop: Although the dolphins have been travelling a long way - 6,060miles - along the South African coast, there is still time for fun and play

All for one: The pods protect each other against predators, but also keep families together, hunt together and communicate
