Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has denied a charge of misconduct from the Football Association.

Van Gaal was charged for criticising referee Chris Foy after United's 0-0 draw with Cambridge in the FA Cup on January 23.

The FA charged Van Gaal last week, saying his words 'allege and/or imply bias on the part of the match referee and/or bring the game into disrepute.'

The Dutchman asked the Football Association for more time ahead of making his official appeal

'We knew in advance everything would be against us - but you have to survive,' the 63-year-old said after his side were forced to a rematch by a stubborn Cambridge performance at Abbey Stadium.

'And then you have seen the referee - its always the same. Everywhere I have coached these games, and I have coached them with other clubs, it's always the same.

'What was wrong with the referee? You can give your own opinion, I can't give mine.' 

Van Gaal always maintained he would contest the charge last week having requested an extra day from the FA to formalise his response.

Van Gaal made comments about referee Chris Foy after his side were forced into a replay against the U's 

The Dutchman said ahead of their clash at West Ham on Sunday: ‘I am not angry, I am very disappointed. I am now for nearly 30 years a trainer-coach or manager and I have never been charged. And still, up to now, I don’t think that I said something wrong.

‘I said already in our press conference (before the game) the same phrases, because I know in advance everything is in favour of the underdog.

‘I said it before the game and I said it after the game, only in the meaning of the general feeling of everybody, everybody for the underdog,' added van Gaal.

‘So I cannot imagine the FA has charged me. But, OK, it’s like that. Of course I will contest it. I never said anything wrong. You can confirm, as the media, that I never say anything about the referee, in all the matches.’ 

The FA confirmed the news on their Twitter page: 'Louis Van Gaal denies FA misconduct charge in relation to media comments and requests a personal hearing, date to be confirmed.'
