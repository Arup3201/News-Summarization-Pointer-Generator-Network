The story of their romance is something like a fairytale – boy meets girl, they fall in love and live happily ever after.

But forget the glass slippers and the midnight curfew, Steve, 34, and Kristy Davey, 34, met when they celebrated at Schoolies in 1998 and are now happily married with three kids - Joel, four, Joshua, three and Luke, 18 months.

The Schoolies sweethearts came from different towns – Kristy from Lismore, northeastern New South Wales and Steve from Narrabeen in northern Sydney – and both stayed in neighbouring apartments at the Surfers Del Ray Hotel.

‘When I first spotted Kristy arriving at the hotel, I thought “this could be a fun week”,’ Mr Davey told Daily Mail Australia.

‘All our friends got on really well and we had such a great time together.’

Mrs Davey told Daily Mail Australia: 'It sounds corny but could I say it was love at first sight?'

'I was taken back by his smile when I first saw him on the balcony - I still tell him now and I see that in my youngest son Luke.'

The couple tied the knot in 2009 and decided to move to Brisbane to start their family

But the week-long festivities didn’t end there. The pair continued their relationship for the next 12 months.

‘We exchanged numbers and decided to give the long distance a shot,’ Mr Davey said.

‘I went to Lismore and hung out with her family and friends and she would come see me in Sydney – I thought she had a really fun personality and a great sense of humour.

‘I also remember when my family organised a trip to the UK and my brother even insisted on paying for my flight but I told them that I was due to see my girlfriend.

‘One time we were sitting on the beach at Narrabeen and Kristy started crying because she knew she had to go back home. But I said: “Don’t worry, you should come and live with me”.

Kristy moved to Sydney and lived with Steve and his parents for three years while she studied a degree in registered nursing.

'Steve's parents were gracious enough for me to come and stay - providing I had a part time job,’ Mrs Davey said.

‘We moved out once I finished my degree and had full time work while Steve continued to study and complete his combined law and science degree and worked part time.'

In October this year, the family moved to the Gold Coast - where their fairytale story began

The pair lived in Sydney for 10 years before they tied the knot in February 2009 and had their first son Joel in February 2010.

‘We had a big wedding and we could overlook the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We relocated to Brisbane in mid-2010 and remained there for four years and had another two beautiful boys – Joshua and Luke,’ Mr Davey said.

‘We decided to move there because it would be a cheaper lifestyle and we couldn’t afford to buy a house in Sydney – also Kristy’s family lives in Lismore so it was closer to them and they could see the kids.'

But the family moved to the Gold Coast in October this year, which brought back the 'very fond memories' of their Schoolies experience.

‘We moved again to our favourite place and the place we met and now call home,’ Mrs Davey said.

‘On December 12th this year we will be celebrating 16 years together and I couldn't think of a better place to be than back living where it all began.

Despite Schoolies grabbing national headlines this year, the couple said they will not let their children miss the experience they once shared.

'We got to see them [school leavers] down here yahooing off the balcony and having a great time - I'm not going to take that experience away from my kids,' Mr Davey said.

'I had one of the best weeks of my life and they deserve to take over the town - I think the parties now are pretty much the same when we were there. Except we didn't have the digital cameras to document anyone passing out in the gutter and you could get away with it.

'Who knows? They could meet their soul mates there and an advice to Schoolies - Don't break all the girls' hearts because you'll just break your own heart in the process - it's corny but it's true. 

Mrs Davey added: 'We couldn't say no but I am nervous about sending the boys there when they finish high school. We were given the opportunity to go to Schoolies so we can't wrap them in cotton wool and stop them from going, could I?'
