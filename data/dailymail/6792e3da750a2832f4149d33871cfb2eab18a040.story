Cally Simpson, four, is fighting for her life after being found unconscious at the bottom of a Spanish pool

A four-year-old girl on her first holiday abroad is fighting for her life after being found at the bottom of a swimming pool in Spain.

Cally Simpson was on holiday at the Villa Marina resort in Salou, Catalonia, with her dad Steven and grandmother when she was found unconscious.

The girl, from Arbroath, Angus, was pulled from the pool by another tourist and attempts were made to resuscitate her.

She is now said be in a stable condition at the intensive care unit at a children's hospital in Barcelona.

Earlier today, her mother Kate fought her
 way through a strike by French air traffic controllers to get on a 
flight to Spain so she could be by her daughter's bedside.

Her distraught grandmother said they still did not know how the youngster ended up in the pool.

Wendy Simpson, also from Arbroath, said: 'This was her first ever holiday. She can't swim.

'We are all praying that she will pull through. There has been a slight improvement. They have started to raise her temperature to 36.5 degrees. She is now stable.

'We were all there, but we don't know what happened.

'The last time we saw her she was walking behind her dad to the main building. We have no idea how she came to be in the pool.

'A man called Ash found her after a couple of minutes in the pool, I don't know his full name.'

A Facebook page, Saving Cally Simpson, was set up to raise funds to pay for Kate's travel costs and now has more than 1,500 supporters.

Messages of support have flooded in on the site and Cally's family have been adding to the page to update people about the young girl's condition.

On the site, her mother wrote: 'Ill see use the moro at 4 oclock tea time wow cant believe how much support every1 has gave us. A massive thank you to all use guys we really appreciate it xxxx'

Sara Warren wrote: 'My heart goes out to you and your family.'

Family friend Koula McCracken said the whole of Arbroath is praying for Cally.

She said: 'Everyone is praying for Cally to pull through. We all did a whip round so Kate has money when she is in Spain. Kate is an amazing mum and Cally is her world.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident involving a British national in Spain. We are providing consular assistance.'
