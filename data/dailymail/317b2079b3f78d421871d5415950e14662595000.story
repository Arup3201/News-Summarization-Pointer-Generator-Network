Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored an outrageous flying back flick as Paris Saint-Germain trained in Hong Kong on Monday.

The frontman rose to pull off an audacious effort past goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu and executed the strike to perfection as the ball nestled inside the post.

Having previously played for Barcelona, Juventus and Ajax, Ibrahimovic is no stranger to scoring spectacular goals - his latest effort will remind fans of the exquisite propeller kick he scored for Sweden against England in November 2012.

The 32-year-old looked sharp as he 
continues his battle for full fitness ahead of the new Ligue 1 season 
with PSG.

The
 French champions are preparing to face local side Kitchee on Tuesday 
and the Sweden striker will be hoping to play some part after a 
football-free summer.

The Swedes failed to qualify for the World Cup in Brazil, allowing Ibrahimovic 
time to fully recover from the hamstring injury he picked up in the 
latter stages of last season.

Laurent 
Blanc's men have been put through their paces ahead of the first fixture
 of their tour of Asia and Ibrahimovic has spoken of his excitement at 
being in Hong Kong.

Speaking on Sunday, PSG's No 10 said: 
'I've very happy to be here. We plan on continuing our pre-season 
training here in Hong Kong.

Hopeful
 of landing Europe's major prize having reached the quarter-finals of 
last season's Champions League, Ibrahimovic continued: 'One of them is the
 Champions League. We have won two French championships in a row and the
 Coupe de la Ligue.

'Everyone dreams of winning the Champions League, and me too.'
