When a New Jersey girl learned that someone scrawled graffiti in her hometown making fun of her body, the 14-year-old decided to turn a mark of shame into a source of pride and inspiration.

Instead of brushing off the offensive writing referring to her rear end, 14-year-old Carleigh O'Connell, of Wall, marched down to the beach where the tag was left and posed with it for a selfie. 

'I wanted to show whoever decided to write that that I was stronger than that,’ she told TODAY.com. ‘It didn't impact me at all. I didn't put my head down, I didn't cry about it. I didn't give the kids the power they wanted.'

The high school student said she had been teased about her body in the past, so when her friend told her that someone spray-painted the words 'carleighs a**' on a cement block near the local beach, she knew at once it was about her.

With her mind made up, Carleigh went down to the beach dressed in a bikini, stood on top of the defaced rock with her back to the camera and posed for a picture.

Her mother told BuzzFeed said that at first the teen snapped a photo with her face turned away, but later decided to flash a smile for the camera to show her tormentors that she has nothing to be ashamed of.

'It felt very empowering,' Carleigh told TODAY of the experience. 'It felt really good.'

Carleigh’s mother, Daryl Lynn O'Connell, was proud of her daughter for taking a stand against bullies.

She posted the teen's photo on her Facebook page and asked her friends to share it as many times as possible.

'I 
hope it travels across the country and can help one teenager who is 
bullied or the victim of hurtful things,' the mother wrote.

In
 her lengthy post, Mrs O'Connell went on to say that Carleigh told her 
that she was going to be proud of her figure, and that she feels 
sympathy for kids all over the country who suffer bullying every day.

'She understands and wants all of them to find strength inside to rise above the nastiness and be empowered by who you are, how you are made and what is in your heart,' wrote the mother.

So far, the photo of Carleigh has been shared nearly 1,200 times on Facebook.

The 14-year-old high-schooler noted that in her view, the graffiti was not an act of bullying per se but rather a cruel, humourless joke.

In her emotional message, Carleigh's mother said this positive attitude will take her daughter very far in life.

On her part, Carleigh O’Connell said she hopes other teens facing bullying would learn from her experience the importance of staying strong.
