These music acts are so underground...they don't even exist. 

Talk show host and prankster Jimmy Kimmel fooled SXSW attendees for the second year in a row, by asking for their opinions on fake bands.

A television crew at the Austin, Texas, festival spoke with people in man-on-the-street interviews. Those interviewed seemed unaware it was for Kimmel's 'Lie Witness News,' which catches people fibbing.

All but one claimed to be familiar with the musical artists discussed, despite the fact none of them are real,  apparently in an attempt to be cool.

Liars: At SXSW, the woman on the left claimed to like the group 'Mary Kate and Nasty,' while the man on the left said he was a fan of 'DJ Underwire.' Both musical acts, however, do not exist 

In the clip, a female voice off-camera asks a woman in a scarf for her opinion on 'Mary Kate and Nasty,' in a twist on the names of Olsen twins Ashley and Mary Kate.

'I do love Mary Kate and Nasty,' the woman says. 'I really, really do.'

'I just like female singers generally, so I just their kind of - punky, poppy sound,' she says. 

A male attendee in a button-down offers a full explanation on his love for 'DJ Underwire.'

'Yeah, DJ Underwire is great,' the man says. 'He's really mixing it up with actually turntable-ism and bringing that back in, scratching, right? So it's something that is oftentimes lost on some of the newer-age DJs, and I think it's great how he's bringing that back in.' 

Another man at SXSW says he's a  'DJ Gluten' fan - though the interviewer says some find him 'hard to take.'

'I like it,' the man says. 'I listen - I have some of it on my phone, actually. I like some of it.' 

Pretending: The man on the left said he was a fan of 'DJ Cialis' - like the erectile dysfunction medication - and the man on the right said he was a fan of 'DJ Gluten'

The video shows one man with a full beard and hat describing the group 'Eddie and His Manpurse.' 

'Um, well, Manpurse, is, that's the band, and Eddie is the lead singer, so, you pretty much get to see the whole manpurse. Like, you get to see the whole band,' he explains. 

A man in glasses lies that he's familiar with 'DJ Cialis' - named for the erectile dysfunction medication.

'Yeah dude, he's got the beat,' the man says. 'He rolls it.' 

Jokingly referring to the drug's potential harm, the interviewer asks 'Is DJ Cialis a little dangerous if he lasts more than four hours at one of his sets?'

'Dangerous? Really?' the man says, puzzled.

He even says he's looking forward to hearing 'Jimmy and the Kimmels.'

'Wait, you said Jimmy and the Kimmels?' he asks. 'Not like Jimmy, like Kimmel, but just like, just like...'

'Like Lie Witness News,' the interviewer says.

'Okay, alright,' he says laughing. 'Why not man, why not?'

A woman lies that she knows the band 'Ashley and the Kale Chips' - and fibs she's seen the group in person, but 'only once.'

'I think they're awesome,' she says. 'They have a different sound. You know, it's not like everything so mainstream that you hear all the time.'

Interviewed: One woman (left) claimed to be a fan of 'Ashley and the Kale Chips,' while another (right) said she was a fan of 'Cheez Whiz Khalifa' and three other fake artists 

A woman in a pink shirt lies that she knows four different music acts.

Asked about 'Wiz Khalifa's little brother, Cheese Whiz Khalifa,' the woman says 'Yeah, he has a good sound. I definitely like it. Um, one of my friends is really into him, and so he's more - he's showed me a lot more of him than I've been exposed to.'

When quizzed about 'Vlad and the Putins' - a twist on the name of Russian president Vladimir Putin - she answers 'Okay, I have heard of them, I haven't listened to a lot of it.' 

She even says she is familiar with 'DJ Fictionnel.'

'I actually saw him in France, when I was in Lyon,' she exclaims. 

The interviewer says at one point 'Do you like the band Jimmy Kimmel Just Made Me Lie for Like 15 Minutes?'

'Yes,' the woman in pink replies, while laughing and putting her hand to her face.

A man in a hoodie gives a roundabout reply to a question calling for his opinion on fake music group 'So Much Marijuana.'

He says 'I like marijuana. I like a lot of marijuana. So, So Much Marijuana is a good name for a band. I endorse that.' 

He then goes on to say that marijuana should be legalized in 'all 52 states.'
