Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran may be shackled, blindfolded and executed by firing squad in the middle of the night.

The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death as early as next Sunday under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases.

The Australians may only be given several days notice if scheduled for execution, facing the imminent possibility of their death following the recent increase in criminal executions after a five year respite.

After living on death row in Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Indonesia, for almost a decade, and four failed clemency applications, Sukumaran and Chan are on a list of 26 prisoners Indonesia says will be executed this year. 

If Chan and Sukumaran are executed under the same conditions that previous inmates have faced, they will be taken from their cells at midnight to face their death with their hands and feet shackled.

The pair will be offered blindfolds to wear, and will have white aprons around their neck and a red target on their chest.

Chan and Sukumaran will also be given choice to stand, sit or lie down when the firing squad carries out their execution from a distance of between five and ten metres, reported The Sydney Morning Herald.

In 2008, Nigerian nationals Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Antonious Nwaolisa were strapped to crucifixes with black hoods over their heads before being shot, reported news.com.au.

'It was simple: one, two, three, then ‘bang’,' said Father Charlie Burrows, who witnessed their deaths.

The pair took nearly ten minutes to be pronounced dead, moaning and bleeding until they succumbed to their injuries.

'I think it is cruel, the torture...The blood came out slowly; they were in pain,' Father  Burrows said during his testimony before Indonesia’s Constitutional Court.

The members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 on charges of a plot to smuggle heroin into Australia

Inmate Marco Moreira, who is scheduled to die by firing squad on Sunday, is among four men and one woman scheduled to die just after midnight on Sunday morning, facing the 'Brimob'- five firing squads made up of 12 police. 

The Brazillian national was only given three days notice of his death by prison authorities who sat opposite him to break the news.

Sukamaran's mercy plea was rejected by the Indonesian government on December 30th, while Chan's plea is yet to be finalised.

Their fate rests heavily on Chan's clemency bid, as the pair have been informed that they will face execution together for their plot to smuggle over 8 kilograms of heroin into Australia.

Julian McMahon, the pair's Australian lawyer, said that executions were 'not clean killings', and that prisoners may be tied to a plank before being shot.

'If the prisoner isn’t dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head,' Mr McMahon said.

Mr McMahon said that Sukamaran and Chan were traumatised by their impending execution, and often dreamed of being shot in the heart by the prison's firing squad.

Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system

Sukamaran and Chan attended school together at Homebush Boys High School in Sydney's west, and Chan said the pair had been relying on each other in an attempt to 'trying to stay strong for our family and friends at this difficult time.'

'It is hard to think that our lives are in the hands of two men - Tony Abbott and Joko Widodo - who have the power to grant life and death - please pray for a change of heart for these men and for our families,' he wrote in comments passed onto the Facebook page Friends of Andrew Chan.

Mr McMahon labelled the potential executions 'chilling', and said that he could not fathom simply taking prisoners outside and shooting them.

'It seemed impossible to be true that they would take out these people on the weekend and just shoot them. That was my first reaction,' Mr McMahon said. 

News of the looming executions has galvanised Australians seeking clemency for Chan and Sukumaran, with 2,500 signatures on a petition begging Indonesian president Joko Widodo for mercy on their behalf.

Mr Abbott (with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, left) said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution

The petition was set up on Friday morning and had been attracting another signature every five seconds, reflecting the urgency of a previous Mercy Campaign petition which garnered more than 20,000 signatures.

Mercy Campaign co-founder Brigid Delaney called on Prime Minister Tony Abbott to increase his efforts to save the men's lives, calling his response 'very weak'.

Mr Abbott said earlier this month that his government would make 'the strongest possible representations' to Indonesia to seek a stay of execution, but admitted he would not risk jeopardising diplomatic relations.

'If this does go ahead I think there will be such visceral outrage and questions will be asked of Tony Abbott - why didn't you do more?,' Ms Delaney said. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop made a direct appeal to Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi, reported The Australian. 

'They [the Australian Government] tried their utmost, they asked us to reconsider our decisions because their citizens have shown remorse, have expressed their deepest regrets,' said a spokesperson for Indonesia's Foreign Ministry.

Mr McMahon labelled the 'injustice' of the situation 'heartbreaking' and said that the pair had made significant efforts to improve their lives and the lives of others in the Indonesian prison system. 

'Myuran and Andrew are not just reformed prisoners leading good lives. They have indisputably changed and improved the lives of many prisoners,' he said.
