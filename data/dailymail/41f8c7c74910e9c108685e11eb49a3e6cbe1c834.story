Charities and campaigning groups fear they could be hampered by new government plans designed to regulate lobbyists.

Ministers have drawn up rules which they say will make the links between politicians and big businesses more transparent.

But the legislation was fiercely attacked by dozens of charities and think-tanks who say it will prevent legitimate campaigning.

Charities and campaigning groups say the new rules passed yesterday at the House of Commons will prevent legitimate campaigning

The law would introduce a compulsory register of lobbyists for people working as independent consultants following scandals about attempts to influence government decision-making.

But it would also brings in caps on the spending of non-political organisations during the year before an election.

The rule, which is intended to target the power and funding leveraged by trade unions, means organisations will be able to spend only £390,000 nationally – down from £989,000.

In individual constituencies they will see their spending during election year capped at just £9,750.

The law managed to pass the House of Commons yesterday by 300 votes to 249. It is expected to face more difficulties in the House of Lords.

However former cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan told MPs that people who were fighting the HS2 rail  project ‘firmly believe the Bill contains provisions that will inhibit their effectiveness in ensuring that their voice is heard by the Government’.

Joe Rukin, campaign manager of Stop HS2 said: ‘It’s an absolute disaster. We feel we have been victims of our own success.

Former cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan told MPs that people fighting HS2 believe the Bill will 'inhibit' their voices being heard but Andrew Lansley insisted charities could make their case 'as forcefully as they wish'

'The government don’t like what we have been saying so they want to make our activities illegal. Campaign groups exist to change politicians opinions, so this could not be more against the principle of free speech, it’s insane and rotten to the core.

‘This bill is in the name of clipping the wings of big money cloak and dagger lobbying and yet, because it only affects those whose major business is lobbying, lots of them will actually miss the bullet.’

Jeremy Lefroy, the Tory MP for Stafford, pointed out that important campaigns ‘may only arise during an election campaign’.

And a group of major charities – including the Royal British Legion, Oxfam and the British Heart Association – have signed a letter to ministers explaining their opposition to the new rules.

But Leader of the House Andrew Lansley insisted charities could make their case ‘as forcefully as they wish’ unless they were using money to try and ensure the election of particular candidates.

And a Downing Street spokesman said: ‘This Bill will take the big money out of politics so you don’t have unaccountable funding pouring into constituencies. It will not substantially change the rules for charities.’
