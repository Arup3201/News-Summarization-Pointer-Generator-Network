Parents should tell their children they love them every day to help make them more ready for learning at school, according to new advice from head teachers.

Families often assume their sons or daughters feel loved but they need to hear the words frequently to boost their self-esteem.

They should also praise youngsters by repeating phrases such as ‘you are learning fast’, ‘that was a kind thing to do’ and ‘keep working on it, you’re nearly there’.

The recommendations are contained in a leaflet, Your Child’s Wellbeing: A Short Guide For Parents, issued by the school leaders’ union, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Family Action charity.

But education campaigners have condemned the advice as ‘nanny state meddling’, insisting that parents do not need ‘patronising’ reminders from head teachers about how to speak to their children.

The leaflets are being distributed to NAHT’s 28,500 members who will share them with parents at their schools.

They are the fifth in a series produced by the NAHT and Family Action, with other topics covering literacy and numeracy and speaking and listening.

The latest top tips for parents include trying to be a ‘positive role model’ by not shouting or swearing in front of children and establishing boundaries to help them ‘feel safe’.

They should praise their child’s efforts as well as achievements, for example telling them they’ve done well for trying hard and that it’s okay to make mistakes.

When their son or daughter does something wrong, they should ‘tell them, but focus on their action and how to do better next time’.

A section on raising self-esteem adds: ‘When things are difficult help your child to see it as part of life and learning and that it happens to all of us. Teach your child not go give up and to keep trying.

Bernadette Hunter, NAHT president, said: 'If children feel happy and healthy at home then they come into the classroom free from worries and ready to learn' (file picture)

‘Listen to your child and show them you value their views and opinions.’

Other tips include encouraging children to eat a balanced diet, bake and help prepare family meals and exercise vigorously for at least 30 minutes each day.

The leaflet suggests getting out and about as a family, playing tag in the park or going on a bike ride together.

Saying ‘well done’ will encourage children to ‘learn that taking on challenges and making mistakes is an essential part of learning’. Under ‘emotional well-being’, it adds: ‘Tell your child that you love them every day’.

But Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said that ‘99.9 per cent of parents’ don’t need that reminder and ‘instinctively’ say such things.

He said: ‘Head teachers need to trust parents more. Mostly parents don’t need that sort of advice. It’s nanny state, it’s interfering, it’s patronising and it’s unnecessary.

‘It’s almost discouraging parents from following their natural instincts and doing what’s right. By saying ‘we’re taking over’, you’re going to undermine parents and probably damage the children.

‘It’s yet another example of the State or the profession’s failure to understand that people don’t need to be told the obvious. It’s distrustful in that sense.’

But Bernadette Hunter, NAHT president 2013-14, said: ‘Modern life is so highly pressured for parents that it can be easy to forget to do the little things that can make a real difference to a child’s self-esteem.

‘For instance, sometimes we assume our children know that we love them but children need to hear the words.

‘If children feel happy and healthy at home then they come into the classroom free from worries and ready to learn. I believe parents are the best partners schools can have in helping pupils make the most of their education.’

She added: ‘The leaflet tells about the importance of helping a child persevere with tasks and reassuring them that it is ok to make mistakes. Trying out some of the suggestions can go a long way to giving children a sense of wellbeing which will give them a good starting point for school life.’

David Holmes, chief executive of Family Action, said: ‘If the practical advice in this simple leaflet makes a parent pause just for a second and reflect on the wellbeing of their child then it will have done a good job.’

* Three-quarters of 1,018 parents surveyed by the NAHT believe that introducing ‘too much change into schools too quickly’ damages their children’s education.
