New Yorkers still licking their wounds from one of the worst winters in recent memory may now have to contend with a brutally hot and humid summer.

The 2014 Farmer’s Almanac is predicting a summer with above average heat, humidity and precipitation for the tri-state area. Some are already half-jokingly referring to it as the 'Solar Vortex.'

The long-term forecasters at the Almanac are also calling for a major hurricane to take a similar path to Sandy and slam the region in the middle of September.

‘It looks like it’s going to be an oppressively hot and humid summer for the New York area,’ Sandi Duncan, the almanac’s managing editor, told the New York Post.

‘It’s going to be very humid and thundery,’ she added.

Temperatures will predictably heat up in mid-June, but will bring with them monsoon-like rains that will soak New Yorkers to the bone, according to the book.

The ‘Solar Vortex,’ as Gothamist has already called it, will inundate the metro region with heavy rains and high temperatures through Mid-August but somehow save a dry day for July 4.

Things will then begin to cool off and dry out as August draws to a close.

Gothamist forecaster Joe Schumacher seemed conflicted about the coming summer.

He said he enjoys reading the books, but ‘no forecast that predicts specific weather for specific days months in advance has any shred of credibility.

‘That sort of forecast, where the exact weather is predicted, shows no skill beyond about ten days and becomes theoretically impossible beyond 2-3 weeks,’ he added.

Weather predictions looking that far into the future play on probabilities, and that saying ‘a hurricane will threaten the East Coast from Sept. 16-19 is the equivalent of selling snake oil,’ said Schumacher.

But then he lent credence to the idea of a harsh summer.

‘There is some agreement among long-range forecasters that an El Nino, a warming of the eastern Pacific Ocean, will develop this summer.

‘El Niño is associated with fewer tropical storms bothering the northeast and warmer winters.’

Published since 1818, the Almanac claims to correct predict forecast 80 per cent of the time using astrological and mathematical formulas that take sunspot activity, lunar cycles and planetary alignment into account.

It did predict this year’s winter – almost to a T.
