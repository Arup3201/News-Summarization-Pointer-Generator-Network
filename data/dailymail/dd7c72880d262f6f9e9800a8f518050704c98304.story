One 13-year boy from san, Antonio Texas was shocked to tears on Thursday night after his mother he hadn't seen in eight months surprised him at a middle school baketball game.

Lt. Col. Cotina Jenkins-Sellers of the 386th Expeditionary Support Squadron  returned from Kuwait after a long stay and planned to surprise her 13-year-old son Derrick Jenkins while he made a free throw.

Coaches at Legacy Middle school and Derrick's father Michael Sellers arranged for a fake technical foul so that Jenkins' mother could sneak up behind her son and take him into her arms after so many months of being away.

Jenkins-Sellers had no idea how her son would react and jokingly told reporters at KSAT 12 that she was worried her son would be mad at her if he cried because he is 'in front of friends and girls his age.'

'Aw, that's alright Derrick,' Derek's mother said behind him when he didn't get a throw.

Derrick Jenkin's emotional reaction to hearing his mother is priceless. He was so shocked that he fell to the floor in the middle of the basketball game. His mother then went over to him and gave him a giant hug to make up for the lost time while she was away.

The crowd of students, teachers, and parents applauded unanimously.
