Workplace scandal: Mesa enjoyed sexual relations with four of her pupils at Colonial Forge High School, where both she and her husband worked as teachers 

In exchange for Mesa’s guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped four charges and reduced two others. 

Mesa, who has been in jail since her arrest last September, will be sentenced at Stafford Circuit Court on May 21, reports The Free Lance-Star.

Officials at the high school were tipped off by anonymous phone call informing them that the geometry and statistics teacher had allegedly had sex with a male student.

An investigation revealed that one of the students was 16 years old when the relationship began in late 2013.

Investigators also found out that Mesa allegedly sent nude photos of herself using her cell phone.

Most of the trysts allegedly happened at Mesa's home while her husband wasn't around and one had happened in her SUV.

Mesa admitted to having sex with one teen while another was in her basement waiting his turn. She told authorities she had done it because it made her feel 'attractive and wanted.'

The math teacher had worked at Colonial Forge High School since 2009. As well as losing her job, the teacher's marriage had also disolved as a result of her actions. 

Her husband of two years, Keith Mesa, works at Colonial Forge as a social studies teacher and head volleyball coach. Mesa had coached the volleyball team alongside her husband.

According to the couple's wedding site, the two had only got married July 21, 2012, in Michigan.

Mesa graduated from Concordia University Ann Arbor, where she studied secondary education with a concentration in math and biology, and played volleyball.

Defense attorney Mark Gardner said Mesa is not a pedophile and ‘was not preying on people who had no interest in participating.’

He had asked Judge Victoria Willis to release Mesa on bond until her sentencing, but the request was denied. 

Judge Willis said Mesa would have to 'clean up the mess you have made.'

Her guilty pleas means she will have to register as a sex offender.
