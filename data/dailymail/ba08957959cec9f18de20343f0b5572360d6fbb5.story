In his short career, he survived being shot down from the sky three times and escaped from the Nazis in occupied France.

Now, 70 years after his death, the 
diary of brave Battle of Britain fighter pilot George Barclay has 
brought his remarkable escapades back to life.

In what is thought to be the only 
record of its kind, the heroic Squadron Leader chronicles taking to the 
skies in the cockpits of Hurricanes and Spitfires – and even describes 
being shot down for the first time as a ‘most novel experience’.

A page from the secret diary of Battle of Britain pilot George Barclay. George kept a day-to-day record detailing his life in the skies. In this entry he illustrates wing formations for their next outing. He writes: 'We went off just before tea by ourselves and climbing up to 23,000ft over Maidstone... I was leading yellow section and looking after the squadron's tail'

Pilots were banned from keeping diaries for security reasons, so Barclay resorted to secretly recording his thoughts in exercise books.

His entries display the stiff upper lip that helped our heavily outnumbered pilots win the crucial aerial battle that thwarted Hitler’s invasion plans.

But tragically, they end before the 
Allies secured victory. Barclay was killed in action aged 22, commanding
a Hurricane squadron during the 1942 Battle of El Alamein in Egypt.

Previously his squadron had played a 
key role in the 1940 Battle of Britain, and it was then that the 
Cambridge-educated pilot began secretly putting pen to paper.

His first entry in September of that 
year begins: ‘Yesterday evening we were told we were to move to North 
Weald, Essex, today to relieve the war-weary and much shot up 56 
Squadron. We grabbed beds in the hut and slept soundly, wondering what 
the morrow held in store.’

Just six days later, on September 7, 
Barclay’s plane suffered a direct hit as he duelled with a group of 
German Me109 aircraft. But remarkably, his stricken plane landed ‘wheels
up’ in a field near his airfield.

Of the 12 British planes in his patrol that day, one pilot died and four – including Barclay – were injured.

He wrote afterwards: ‘The odds today 
have been unbelievable (and we are all really very shaken!). There are 
bombs and things falling around tonight and a terrific gun barrage. Has a
blitz begun?’

After being shot down a second time on
November 29 at 22,000ft he recalled: ‘I was shot down today – a most 
novel experience...

‘As I fell out and down on my back one of my boots fell off, apparently to me falling upwards as I left it behind.’

The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940.

It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain.

The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the 
English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences.

From 12 August, Hermann 
Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the
destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases. (Pictured above, RAF scrambling to their planes in 1940.)

Convinced that Fighter Command was 
now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter 
planes to break British strength.

However, Goering grew frustrated by 
the large number of British planes that were still fighting off his 
attacks.

Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on 
Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities.

Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the 
RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above 
London and the south coast.

He was shot down for a third time on 
September 20, 1941, after being ‘jumped’ by five Me109s as he flew over 
France in a Spitfire. His parents, Reverend Gilbert Barclay and wife 
Dorothy – who lost another son, Charles, in the war – received a letter 
reporting that he was missing.

It stated: ‘He was very popular in the Officers’ Mess and his cheerful personality will be greatly missed.’

Remarkably, however, Barclay  had 
survived, and ended up in a French field. He turned his uniform inside 
out to hide the insignia that would reveal his identity, and pretended 
to be a farm worker as Nazis came looking for him.

He was helped by many French civilians
and managed to escape through Spain over a three-month period. His 
diary entry on September 26 describes how he was given  shelter by a 
French woman called Madame Salingue.

He wrote: ‘I was given a very friendly
welcome. Immediately we arrived Madame cooked us two eggs  and chips 
each.

'Apparently that is what the troops asked for before Dunkirk. 
Burbare had quite a large number of British troops billeted there and 
wherever I went I was shown photos of them. The French liked them very 
much.’

After returning home to Cromer, 
Norfolk, Barclay was put in charge of battle-weary 238 Squadron and  led
them out to patrol the El Alamein area of Egypt – where he was fatally 
shot down.

He received a posthumous salute from England in January 1943, when he was Mentioned in Despatches in New Year Honours.

His parents did not discover his diary
until a few years after his death. A version was published in the 
1970s, but an extended edition has now been compiled by historians and 
his brother Richard, now 86, a retired banking director.

The father of four from 
Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire, said: ‘We had no idea that he was 
writing a diary, he never mentioned it when he was on leave.

‘It tells of squadron life and the 
numerous pressures and battles which demonstrate the extraordinary 
dedication and self-sacrifice of all the young men in the country.

He 
wrote his diary in such a straightforward way, you really feel as if you
are sat next to him on the plane.’

The book’s editor, Humphrey Wynn, a 
historian with the Ministry of Defence Air Historical Branch, said it 
was the only daily account of the Battle of Britain kept by a pilot of 
either side.
