Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer has unexpectedly announced his retirement, ending a 13-year reign at the head of the world's largest software company and sending the company's shares up nearly 6 per cent.

Ballmer, 57, took over from co-founder Bill Gates in January 2000, but his leadership was questioned throughout his tenure by Wall Street and Silicon Valley, as Microsoft's stock price floundered.

The company that drove the personal computer revolution has been overtaken in recent years by the likes of Apple and Google in the shift toward mobile computing.

There are no obvious candidates to succeed Ballmer at the company that has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history.

Only last month Ballmer launched a reorganisation to reshape Microsoft into a company 'focused on devices and services'.

Some industry watchers felt it was too little, too late in the effort to restore Microsoft as a technology leader.

'Since he took over in 2000, it is fair to say he missed a number of transitions: mobile, tablets, cloud,' said Zeus Kerravala, an analyst at ZK Research.

'Microsoft continues to live off traditional PC computing. Ballmer's strength is traditional PC computing.

Ballmer was born in 1956 and grew up just outside Detroit.

His father was a manager at the Ford motor company.

Ballmer graduated from Harvard with a degree in mathematics and economics.

He worked for two years at Procter & Gamble as an assistant product manager before dropping out of Stanford Graduate School of Business in 1980 and joining Microsoft.

Ballmer was the first business manager to be employed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

In February 1992 he become executive vice president, Sales and Support before being made president of Microsoft from July 1998.

In January 2000, Ballmer was officially named chief executive officer while Gates stayed on as chairman of the board.

During Ballmer's time as CEO Microsoft has more than tripled revenues and doubled profits.Â 

'He was a great guy for his era but times have changed and a new leadership is needed. It's hard to say his tenure has been a success.'

Ballmer has tripled Microsoft's revenues and more than doubled its profits since he became CEO, yet the company's share price has stayed relatively steady and flat over the last decade.

Shares peaked in late 1999 at a split-adjusted high of $59.97 but has failed to achieve this level since.

Following Ballmer's note to employees announcing his departure, Microsoft shares rose 5.7 percent to $34.26 on Nasdaq.

Ballmer is to retire within the next 12 months, once a special committee has selected a new CEO.

Although he has faced criticism for some time, his decision to retire surprised analysts.

'Yes, this was a surprise, especially considering how close it is to the recently announced strategic overhaul towards devices and services,' said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.

Ballmer himself acknowledged his decision was abrupt.

'There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,' he wrote in a memo to employees.

'This is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.'

Ballmer said in a statement he had originally considered retiring in the middle of the reorganisation, but eventually decided 'we need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.'

The committee to select a new CEO is to be chaired by John Thompson, the board's lead independent director, and includes Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates, as well as other board members Chuck Noski and Steve Luczo.

It will consider both external and internal candidates and work with executive recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles International, according to Microsoft.
