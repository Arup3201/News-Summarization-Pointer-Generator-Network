For all the sound-bites to the contrary, the early months of Ronny Deila’s tenure at Celtic had all the hallmarks of a man caught in the wrong movie.

If the affable Norwegian was cast as an innocent abroad, his senior players had the air of a band of brothers still loyal to the sheriff who’d just left town.

Three championships to the good and the scalp of Barcelona on the sideboard, their resistance to radical change instigated by a man whose very name had prompted a million Google searches was understandable.

Ronny Deila found it tough as he begun life at Celtic after leaving his manager's post at Stromsgodset

Whatever’s the former Stromsgodset manager’s script was, few appeared to be reading it.

‘I did (lie awake) a little at the beginning because it is not about pressure, it is about finding answers,’ Deila recalled on Friday.

‘The first two months, the team wasn’t prepared for the Champions League and that was a hard part to go through.

‘And it’s tough to come from Norway. You don’t get any extra (time) when you are Ronny Deila from Stromsgodset in Norway. It is not a big name.

‘If you see the way forward, I have no problem with pressure.But, if I see it is just crowded around me, and I can’t find the way to get out of the problems, then I am worried.

‘It was (crowded) in the beginning. It was too much in a short time and things I couldn’t handle.’

Those dark days — meek surrenders to Legia Warsaw, Maribor and Hamilton — now seem an age ago.

Of their last 17 domestic games, Celtic have drawn one and lost one. Deila’s side remains a work in progress but tangible signs of their labours are now visible.

By far the most significant victory came against Rangers last weekend. Under pressure to emerge victorious like no manager in Celtic’s history, his late night victory dance – to the strains of Eddie Grant – went viral. Changed days indeed.

‘It’s not the first time I’ve relaxed in this city,’ he smiled. ‘After a game I go to this restaurant with 15 Norwegians, ten of them from my family. I was dancing with my mother, so the mysterious girl was my mother.

‘It was a day my family will never forget.

‘When you sit back when you are 60 years old and talk about this, you were there and you remember.

‘I don’t mind (social media). ‘I’m a happy boy, I love to be social but I’m a hard-working guy as well and very focused.’

And yet, in a sense, Deila has changed over the past eight months. Call Kris Commons to the stand.

For so long a casualty of the break-neck rate of change Deila’s was trying to instigate at the club, the double player of the year winner seemed destined to be ousted at the next available juncture.

Somewhere along the line though, a middle ground has been found. Commons, who concurs with Deila’s belief that he was playing within himself previously, agreed to up his workload. Concurrently, Deila learned that not every outfield player needs to be capable of running at the speed of light.

‘I think Ronny’s changed as well as the squad,’ Commons stated.

‘Ronny’s had huge success in Norway and had a philosophy and a set of players he knew inside out.

‘That’s not guaranteed to bring success to a club like Celtic. So not only have we changed – Ronny has changed to get the best out of our group. We are all on the same page now and the last few performances have definitely shown that.’

Accordingly, the air just seems that bit clearer around Lennoxtown these days. It was not always thus. Commons can now admit to resistance to the new methodology in the early weeks.

‘We’d played the same way for probably the last four years,’ he said.

‘Any sort of little change can put you off the tracks.

‘You do start having doubts especially when you’ve been beaten a couple of times. When you get knocked out of the Champions League, you start scratching your head.

‘I don’t just believe the players have changed, I think Ronny and his backroom staff have too.’

Deila also believes everyone on the ship is now pulling in the one direction. Mutiny may not quite have been in the air as his side floundered in the autumn but uncertainty abounded.

‘I have learned a lot from Celtic and from the players,’ said the Norwegian.

‘We have to communicate together and find the right pattern, the right way.

‘I’ve learned the culture in the country and how important it is to win and to develop while winning.

‘I have learned about the game in Scotland. I have also seen that when you get into a new club with bigger stars who earn money, they are the same people you train in Norway and need the same things.

‘You have to have a smile on your face and we have to do this together with evolution and not revolution. Are we on the same page now? Yes. The team is in a good place.’

It can safely be assumed that Commons played as full a part as anyone. Beaming like a child on Christmas morning on Friday, the midfielder was man enough to admit that some of the demands Deila has made of him and his team-mates were perhaps not so unreasonable after all.

‘Being a No 10 you can get away, especially in the SPFL, probably with being a little bit lazy,’ he admitted.

‘I wouldn’t say I was lazy. I would just say you can probably get away with it. There are certain games where you don’t have to produce your best football.

‘He wasn’t asking me to do things I’m not capable of. At the minute I feel as fit as I have ever been.’

The two-year contract that seemed such a long shot is now documentary proof of Commons winning his manager over and vice versa.

‘He was probably a little bit sceptical of whether I could change the way I am, being 31,’ he added. ‘I think when you have a young kid of 19, 20 you can probably take a few seasons to adapt a player but I’m hoping that I have convinced him that I can do the job.’

What was the turning point?

‘I don’t know, probably not just one thing but hard work, dedication, showing him that I am willing to not so much change my game but adapt to give him what he wants.’

For Commons and his team-mates, the gain has not been without pain. Creatures of habit rarely embrace change. With hindsight, the groans that accompanied the banning of fizzy drinks and chips last year were as inevitable as day following night. But few are complaining now.

‘Since day one, Ronny has come here and wants us to try and play not like a Scottish team, he wanted us to play a Barcelona style, Bayern Munich,’ Commons explained.

‘He’s a real big fan of Pep Guardiola, the way he plays and treats his players.

‘He wants us to be elite athletes. 24 hours a day. That was a big hit for lads who had not done that for four years. But we are going in the right direction now.’

For long enough, Common’s sat-nav seemed set for Bolton. Instead, by belatedly embracing Deila’s words, his foot will be pressed to the floor with Celtic for another two seasons.

‘(I thought) Kris could develop 30 per cent more,’ Deila explained. ‘In the beginning, I didn’t see that kind of improvement from him. That’s why I waited to give him the contract that he wanted. But in the last month he has really bought into it and has been working really hard.’
