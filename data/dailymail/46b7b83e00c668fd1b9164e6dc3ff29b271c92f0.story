Fighter: Aimee Copeland, 24, has been upgraded to 'good' condition by doctors as her battle against the flesh-eating bacteria continues

The young woman who became the first 
person to fall victim to a flesh-eating disease has been suffering the 
worst pain of her entire ordeal, her father said.

Aimee Copeland's agony has become so overwhelming that she has now started taking morphine after initially refusing medication.

However in a Father's Day post on his blog, Andy Copeland said the painkillers were not enough to block his 24-year-old daughter's severe pain, which has spread beyond her amputation sites.

Miss Copeland developed necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a fall on May 1 from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river.

Her left leg, other foot and both hands have been amputated at Doctors Hospital in Augusta.

Despite her agony, Mr Copeland wrote on his blog that his daughter managed to wish him a happy Father's Day.

Last week doctors upgraded her condition to serious from critical after Miss Copeland fought back from the brink of the death.

On
 June 17, Mr Copeland wrote on his blog: 'Over the past 48 hours, Aimee 
has had the most difficult pain she’s experienced through her entire 
ordeal.'

He added: 'The surgery Aimee had on Friday is far more severe than any dressing change imaginable. Aimee is now taking pain medication in as liberal a dose as can be prescribed.

'If she even dared to refuse taking it, which she wouldn’t, then the doctors would most certainly administer it in an IV drip.'

Agony: Aimee Copeland had hoped to be treated with only holistic medicine but the extent of her injuries were too severe

Her father said she occasionally cries from the pain but has to stop because the crying hurts her stomach.

The
 student had originally indicated that she felt a 'traitor to her 
convictions' by using drugs to manage her pain, because she believed in 
holistic medicine.

Her father explained that his daughter had ‘struggled mightily’ with 
pains shooting in her hands – even though they had been amputated.

He
 wrote: 'Although her condition had improved significantly, 
her pain has been considerable. Phantom pain now plagues her ''hands''.'

The
 University of West Georgia student had to have her left leg amputated 
at the hip, her right foot and both hands in order to save her life 
after a cut to her leg became infected.

The
 pain has now spread from her amputation sites to a wound on her left 
side and her right thigh where she has had skin grafts.

The bacteria that attacked Miss Copeland's wound released a toxin that destroys skin, muscle and a layer of tissue below the skin known as fascia, her father said.

Despite the painful skin grafts, the student has crossed several milestones in recent weeks. She can breathe on her own and no longer needs dialysis.

She had been able to eat on her own but has trouble digesting solid food. Miss Copeland ate after her surgery on Friday but she ended up vomiting up everything during the night.

This weekend, thousands of people took part in a fundraising event outside Atlanta to help the family with medical expenses.

The two-day benefit concert in the family’s hometown of Snellville began at 5pm on Friday and ran  through to Saturday night.

Andy Copeland's blog has 
been an inspiration to many all over the world who admire the strength 
and courage of the 24-year-old and her family.

Progress: Aimee Copeland's condition has now been changed from serious to good at the Georgia hospital

Describing his daughter's phantom pains on the blog on June 6, Mr Copeland wrote:  'Although she has no hands, her brain
 is apparently still telling her body that the hands are there.

'I asked 
her if she could describe the pain and she told me, "It feels like I 
have been carrying bags of rocks".

'She said her ''fingers'' feel 
contorted and twisted. Nothing really helps her pain much.'

Aimee has been trying 
to keep positive about the extent of her injuries, but her father 
revealed she struggled to keep calm and accept what has 
happened to her.

He wrote: 'This past week the proverbial poopy hit the fan for Aimee. She was 
lashing out at her care givers, she was in pain, she was sick to her 
stomach, she was unable to tend to her own basic needs and she was very 
unhappy. She had every right to be unhappy.'

After praying, he said his daughter had gained a sense of clam and returned to her normal 'sweet self'.

'Prayer has changed and 
will continue to change much over the coming days, weeks, months and 
years,' he said.

When the student was able to say her first words, which they called Aimee Day, she said to her sister: 'Hello. Whoa. Wow, my mind is blown.'

Mr Copeland was in church at the time and had to wait until the next day to hear his daughter's voice.

When
 her father finally got into Copeland's room around 5pm, he asked her 
how she felt. He said he was thrilled to hear her respond: ‘It feels 
weird being able to talk.’

Andy
 Copeland described his daughter’s newly regained voice as weak and 
raspy, but said that she already has been joking with family, talking 
about her life at the hospital and asking what everyone else has been up
 to.

Miss Copeland has 
improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and 
well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up 
for his brave daughter.

She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read.

Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound.

Doctors at the local emergency room in
 Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it 
became infected within days.

On
 May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to
 Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital.

The
 flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off 
blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat 
and skin tissue.

Less than a month ago, doctors gave her
 little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite 
several major operations. Now she has spoken for the first time, 
although she is likely to remain in hospital for several months.

'This
 doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' 
Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely
 amazed.'
