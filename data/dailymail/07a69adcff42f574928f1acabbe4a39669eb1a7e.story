Aid to help women in poor countries give birth safely is being cut – as money to fight global warming in the Third World is increased.

Funds for doctors, nurses and midwives to help mothers and babies fell from £221million to £183million.

But at the same time, cash for climate change adaptation, low carbon development and protecting forests rose from £281million to £321million.

Spending by the Department for International Development on anti-malaria bed nets, crucial for protecting people from the disease, also fell sharply to £20.3million last year from £25million the previous year.

Critics questioned why money was being diverted from practical life-saving projects towards trendy schemes.

The controversy comes as it emerged David Cameron is due to announce this week that Britain will pump even more – up to £600million – into tackling global warming in the Third World.

Yesterday the Prime Minister insisted that helping people cope with climate change abroad can help reduce the pressure of immigration at home.

Figures in the DfID’s annual report indicate that last year, funding from taxpayers helped four times as many people deal with global warming as it helped mothers give birth safely.

Between 2012/13 and 2013/14, the number helped to ‘cope with the impacts of climate change’ soared from 200,000 to 2.9million.

But the number of mothers helped to give birth safely fell from 1million to 700,000. The number of insecticide-treated bed nets given out, another traditional aid activity, dropped from 11.2million to 9.1million.

Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘People want their money to be used for practical things such as malaria and childbirth – not climate change.’

He added that Britain should not be ‘wasting money on climate change, which I believe is siphoned off for corrupt purposes’.

The report showed that last year aid spending rose 30.5 per cent, higher than previously disclosed, to £11.4bilion. This equates to 0.72 per cent of the national budget.

Spending soared after the Coalition pledged to spend 0.7 per cent on aid, despite cuts to frontline services in the UK.

A section of the report on ‘impact indicators’ shows a rise in the number of those with access to financial services thanks to support from 19.6million to 26.7million. Britain also helped 60.6million people vote in elections, up from 26million.

In the Commons yesterday, Mr Cameron defended higher aid spending, saying: ‘Breaking our promise to the poorest people in the world would not be the right thing to do.

‘When I think about the problems we are facing, whether it’s the pressure of asylum-seekers or immigration, our aid budget is not the answer, it is part of the answer.

‘If you can solve some of the underlying problems in countries with instability, sometimes caused by climate change, then you are doing the right thing.’

Last night a spokesman for the DfID said Britain spent far more on health aid as a whole than on climate change: £1.3billion in 2013/14 compared to £321million. He added UK aid has saved the lives of 36,000 mothers and 64,000 newborns since 2010.
