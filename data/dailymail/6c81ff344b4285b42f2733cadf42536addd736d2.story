Women find men who have had five previous partners much less desirable than men who have had one or two

Women are instinctively turned off by men who have had too many or not enough previous partners.

The right amount? One or two previous girlfriends, according to researchers from James Cook University.

Ryan Anderson and Michele Surbey's study I Want What She's Having - Evidence of Human Mate Copying, published in the journal Human Nature, found that women like men who have been desirable to women in the past.

The phenomenon – known as 'mate copying' in the animal world – also exists among humans.

The study of university students aged between 17 and 40 found that women found men who had had one or two previous partners in the past four years most desirable.

They found men with zero previous partners or one current partner less desirable.

'Our study indicated that women want guys have been to an extent pre-approved,' Mr Anderson said.

'If a guy has been in a relationship with another female it says something about that guy, that he was able to attract this individual and maintain a relationship with her.

'Guys that have been in no relationships might be considered to be creepy or socially inept for whatever reason.'

But they found men who had had five previous partners in the past four years were the least desirable by far.

'They might be considered promiscuous or flaky or unwilling to commit,' Mr Anderson said.

Respondents in the James Cook University survey were also turned off by men who have had zero previous partners

The 123 respondents, who had an average age of 20, rated the sexual and relationship desirability of average looking photographed men, described as single and pictured alone or with one, two, or five female silhouettes, representing their number of previous relationships.

A fifth man was described as currently in a romantic relationship.

The study also found that a woman's self-perceived mate value (SMPV), which measures how desirable she thinks she is as a partner, has absolutely no bearing on her likelihood to mate copy.

'We thought that would be associated with mate copying, that woman that thought highly of themselves would be more likely to seek out men who had been pre-approved,' Mr Anderson said.

Men who have had too many partners 'might be considered promiscuous or flaky or unwilling to commit,' says study author Ryan Anderson

'We didn't really find that to be the case.'

The study also found that the younger a woman is, the more likely she is to mate copy.

'Young women are looking for additional information, they want to know what other people think of this man before they choose him,' he said.

'Older woman are possibly more confident in their decisions, they don't need to know what other people think.'
