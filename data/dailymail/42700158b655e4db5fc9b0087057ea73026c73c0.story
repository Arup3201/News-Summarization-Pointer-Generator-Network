This was the finest drive of Lewis Hamilton’s career in the greatest grand prix of the century.

It was a privilege to be in Bahrain, where Hamilton and his fellow Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg duelled and duelled again, only inches from perdition at up to 200mph. The action behind them was hardly less compelling.

The race rather made those who had criticised this year’s brand of Formula One as boring — not least Bernie Ecclestone and Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo — look as if they were speaking out of their exhaust pipes.

The victor was Hamilton, taking his 
second successive win and his 24th in all to equal Juan Manuel Fangio’s 
career total. It was a race that all the laws of logic decreed he should
 never have won.

He started 
second on the grid to Rosberg, having made a slip in qualifying, but 
stayed tight around the first corner to take the lead and then held off 
Rosberg’s counter-attack on the fourth turn.

Rosberg did not give up. At the start of the 18th and 19th laps he tried to wriggle past Hamilton.

The
 lead changed hands, by my estimation, five times. Rosberg said on the 
team radio: ‘What he did wasn’t on.’ It was heat-of-the-moment 
exasperation rather than a serious complaint.

Head-to-head: The fierce battle between Rosberg and Hamilton began at the outset of the race

Fortune
 favoured Rosberg when a spectacular shunt brought out the safety car. 
Esteban Gutierrez’s Sauber went into a 360 degree somersault when he was
 flipped by Pastor Maldonado’s Lotus. The two Mercedes immediately came 
in to be reshod. Hamilton had to change to the harder tyre, Rosberg 
could use the softer.

The 
softer rubber is faster so, once the safety car peeled away with 10 laps
 remaining, Rosberg would be able to pass his team-mate from a gap that 
had been reduced to virtually nothing by the break in racing.

So
 the theory went. ‘I remember our first race in karting,’ said  Hamilton
 afterwards. ‘Nico was leading all the way and I overtook him on the 
last lap. I thought that would happen to me today.’

So
 did we all. But, no, Hamilton produced his best ever defensive driving 
in repelling the relentless attack from behind. They were crawling over 
each other like  spiders. Rosberg would get in front but Hamilton — in a
 now-you-see-me-now-you-don’t flash — squirmed back ahead.

Credit
 here to Mercedes. Paddy Lowe, in the first serious test of his pit-wall
 nerve since taking over as technical director, came on to both men. He 
said: ‘This is Paddy.’

That made it clear it was the headmaster speaking and defiance would not be tolerated.

‘With 10 laps to race,’ he added, ‘let’s just make sure we bring both cars home.’

It was not an instruction to hold position, but an appeal for sense.

Credit, too, to both Hamilton and Rosberg for possessing the serenity and skill to follow the appeal meticulously.

The
 best drive of Hamilton’s career, we have asserted. A case can be made 
for Silverstone in 2008, when he dominated the wet conditions, 
Senna-like, to win by more than a minute.

But
 this was purer. Here, he was fighting a driver at the peak of his 
career in an equal car on better tyres in a crucial battle in a 
formative world championship rivalry.

So intense was the racing that Rosberg got out of his car and rugby tackled Hamilton through sheer adrenaline.

Moments
 afterwards, his thoughts calmer, the German admitted: ‘I strongly 
dislike losing to Lewis.’ So was this the best of grand prix of the 
century?

Hamilton’s title win in 2008 had a single epic moment of drama.

Jenson
 Button’s triumph in  Canada in 2011 was wet, mad and protracted. Mika 
Hakkinen’s  victory over Michael Schumacher at Spa in 2000 produced an 
overtaking move for the ages.

But has any race contained more wheel-to-wheel action throughout the field? Not that I can recall.

Force
 India fought Force India, with Sergio Perez finally winning through to 
take third after a joust with Nico Hulkenberg. Red Bull fought Red Bull,
 with Daniel  Ricciardo passing world champion Sebastian Vettel for 
fourth.

Williams fought Williams, with Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas going at each other hard.

All
 this was showcased breathtakingly under a necklace of lights in the 
desert. The special bulbs made the car liveries vivid and 
high-definition sharp.

Even 
the build-up to the race was febrile. Team principals walked in and out 
of the adjoining offices of Ecclestone and Jean Todt, the FIA president.

Ferrari
 chief Di Montezemolo told a phalanx of TV cameras that the drivers were
 being reduced to ‘taxi drivers’ because the new regulations placed an 
emphasis on such boring matters as fuel consumption. Ecclestone was in 
the same camp, as are Red Bull.

Not
 so Todt. Although he confirmed that the sport is looking  at ways to 
amplify the engine noise in the next few weeks, he favours the new, 
greener formula.

As does the McLaren chairman Ron Dennis, who rounded on  Vettel’s recent remark that the new turbos sounded ‘s***’.

Dennis, both of whose cars retired with clutch problems, said: ‘Being a world champion requires a dignified approach.

‘Putting aside the language for the moment, the sentiment is inappropriate.’

From rows to racing, it was the Formula One day that had everything under the stars.
