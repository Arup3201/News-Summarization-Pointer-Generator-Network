Charged: Dr Myles Bradbury, 41, was treating children with bone and blood marrow disorders when he allegedly abused boys aged 11 to 15 (file picture)

A children's doctor has been charged with a string of sexual offences against boys as young as 11.

Dr Myles Bradbury, 41, was a consultant paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge when he allegedly touched and photographed boys aged 11 to 15.

A jury will hear he allegedly touched an 11-year-old boy in September and November last year as well as a 12-year-old boy in November 2013.

Bradbury, who treated children with blood and bone marrow disorders, also faces two counts of repeatedly inciting a boy aged 13 to 15 to engage in sexual activity without penetration for a year and a half.

And he is said to have assaulted another boy aged 13 to 15 between December 2011 and July 2013. 

Bradbury, of Herringswell, Suffolk, is also charged with making 16,629 indecent still images and 20 indecent videos of children on or before December 18, 2013.

It is not known if the offences happened at the hospital but Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs Addenbrooke’s Hospital, has set up a helpline to be used 'if parents, patients or former patients have any concerns'. 

Other counts include voyeurism after he allegedly recording a person carrying out a private act for his own sexual gratification without their permission.

The doctor was charged on June 20 and will appear at Cambridge Magistrate's Court tomorrow.

It has not been confirmed whether any of the alleged offences took place at Addenbrooke’s.

A spokesman for Cambridge University Hospitals trust said Bradbury had not worked for them for six months and was no longer employed by them.

They said: 'We are aware of the allegations against Mr Bradbury and we have been working closely with Cambridgeshire police for some time.'
