Stephane Mbia is poised to make a return to the Premier League.

The 28-year-old Cameroon international is a free agent after his contract ran out at Queens Park Rangers in July.

The powerful midfielder enjoyed a successful loan spell at Sevilla last season which culminated in the Spanish side winning the Europa League final against Benfica and finishing fifth in La Liga.

On the up: Mbia has just recently been made Cameroon captain and is set for a return to the Premier League

Mbia, who converted his penalty in the shoot-out win over Benfica, was named in the Europa League ‘Team of the Year’ alongside teammate Ivan Rakitic.

He was appointed the new captain of Cameroon this week, taking over from Everton’s new signing Samuel Eto’o, and is ready to play in England again.

‘I have trust in my agent Willie McKay and his business partner Pierre Frelot to find me the right club,’ Mbia told Sportsmail. ‘They are looking for the best opportunity for me to play and I am absolutely ready for a new challenge.

Mbia, who has been linked with Arsenal this summer, added: ‘People didn’t see the true, 100 per cent me while I was at QPR and I want to show what I can do.

‘I had a very good season in Seville and I feel a lot more positive and happy about where I am. 

'It is not just about the individual but the team and the organisation of the club that helps a player and I rediscovered my confidence in Spain.’

Mbia is willing to take a one year contract for now to ensure a move to the Premier League as clubs search frantically for last minute bargains, although his free agent status allows him to move after the window closes at 11pm on Monday.
