Mia Farrow has continued her attacks on her ex Woody Allen in light of his Golden Globes tribute by bringing up the claims of sexual assault that one of her adopted daughters made against the famed director.

She posted a loaded question to her more than 370,000 Twitter followers on Monday, asking them to decide if Allen was a pedophile for what he did to her daughter Dylan in 1992.

The Twitter outrage came after Allen's former lover and muse Diane Keaton made a gushing tribute to the director at last night's Golden Globes where he was honored with the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille award.

While Keaton was praising the 'complicated' female roles that Allen writes for women, his estranged son Ronan Farrow and ex Mia took the opportunity to remind the world about the filmmaker's past history of alleged sexual assault.

Strong words: Woody's son and ex-girlfriend weren't happy about him receiving an honour at the Golden Globes

Continuing the story: Farrow promoted the Vanity Fair story as a way to show her side

Allen and Mia Farrow had a 
relationship for more than a decade, but that ended when she found out 
that he was having sex with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi. Her discovery 
of naked pictures that the director had taken of the then-teenage girl 
were coupled with sexual assault allegations made by her 7-year-old 
daughter Dylan- who she had adopted with Allen.

Diane Keaton accepted Woody Allen's Cecil B. DeMille award on his behalf at Sunday night's Golden Globes, and dedicated a large part of her glowing speech to the roles that he writes for women.

‘It's kind of hard for 
me to wrap my mind around the fact that 179 of the world's most 
captivating actresses have appeared in Woody's films and there's a 
reason for this. The reason is they wanted to,' she said at the ceremony.

‘They wanted to because Woody's women 
can't be compartmentalised, right? I mean, they struggle, they love, 
they fall apart, they dominate, they're funny, they're flawed. They are,
 in fact, the hallmark of Woody's work.

Allen was noticeably absent from the affair but that came as little surprise since he has made a point to never attend award ceremonies throughout his career.

Keaton, 68, ended the speech by bizarrely singing the Girl Scouts anthem.

Keaton and Allen dated in the 1970s and she starred in eight of his films including Annie Hall.

Dylan's
 case was never tried and charges were dropped against Allen, but they 
were heard in the custody hearings between Farrow and Allen, and on 
Sunday night, Ronan made sure that the world did not forget the charges 
either.

‘Missed the Woody Allen tribute - did 
they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at 
age 7 before or after Annie Hall?’ he tweeted.

Mia, who is also active on Twitter, made her dig slightly less pointed but direct all the same.

The Rosemary’s Baby star had been 
live tweeting the ceremony, but made it clear that as soon as Woody’s 
tribute was about to begin, she was switching off.

‘Time to grab some icecream & switch over to #GIRLS,’ she wrote, followed by a simple: ‘Nite all.’ [sic]

Allen has long denied the claims made by Dylan- as she said that he sexually assaulted her in the attic of Farrow's Connecticut home in 1992. 

The judge dropped the case in 1993 to avoid the trauma of Dylan having to appear in court but said he had ‘probable cause’ to prosecute him on sexual molestation charges.

Mia, now 68, and Woody, 78, separated 
after the actress discovered the director was having a sexual 
relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he is now married 
to and they now have children of their own.

Ronan has cut off all communication from Allen and Dylan has done the same but to an even greater degree. 

Speaking publicly for the first time in years, Dylan- who has since changed her name- told Vanity Fair that
 Allen tried contacting her twice after the court-ordered no-contact 
issuance ended when she turned 18-years-old. Both times, Dylan had a 
visceral reaction to her father's letters.

The Vanity Fair article- which also 
included Mia's suggestion that her ex-husband Frank Sinatra may have 
actually been Ronan's biological father- was published in November and 
written by Maureen Orth.

Ms
 Orth's son, Luke Russert, is Ronan's colleague at MSNBC and after 
Russert tweeted a link to the story during the Golden Globes, Mia 
retweeted it.

Outrage: Farrow continued to tweet about her daughter's allegations of sexual abuse on Monday

Back in the day: Mia and Woody (seen here in 1988, Mia holding Ronan and Woody holding Dylan) were together for more than a decade before they split amid allegations that he sexually assaulted Dylan when she was 7-years-old

Complicated: Mia Farrow adopted Soon-Yi (seen together in 1991) with her second husband Andre Previn but then went on to raise her with her later partner Woody Allen, who she split with when his sexual relationship with Soon-Yi was discovered. Soon-Yi and Woody stayed together and are now married (seen in September)

Mia then
 posted her own link to the story this morning, asking her more than 
370,000 followers to decide for themselves whether or not Allen is a 
pedophile.

Sunday 
night's tweet was not the first time that Ronan has bad-mouthed his 
father, slamming his relationship with Soon-Yi on Father's day in 2012.

'Happy father’s day — or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law’s day,' Ronan wrote at the time.

While his former family members may have
 been critical of their estranged father and partner, the stars in the 
room at the Golden Globes ceremony were filled with praise, as Diane 
Keaton accepted the Cecil B. Demille award on Allen's behalf.

The lifetime achievement award was voted on by members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and has previously been awarded to Jodie Foster, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg among many others.

Diane, 68, starred in Annie Hall, as well as seven other of Woody’s films, while 25-year-old Emma will be starring in his next project, Magic In The Moonlight.

Diane, even bizarrely sang a little song, and swore during the speech, said: ‘I think it's safe to say that Woody Allen is an anomaly.

‘He's made 74 movies in 48 years. He's directed them, he's starred in them, he's produced them and, of course, he's written them. He's written all of them, every one.’

Special honor: Diane Keaton (L) and Emma Stone accepted the Cecil B. DeMille award on Woody's behalf

‘They wanted to because Woody's women can't be compartmentalised, right? I mean, they struggle, they love, they fall apart, they dominate, they're funny, they're flawed. They are, in fact, the hallmark of Woody's work.

‘But what's even more remarkable is that absolutely nothing links these unforgettable characters from the fact that they came from the mind of Woody Allen. And there you have it.’

The end of Diane’s speech got cut off because she said how Allen would have been thinking 'get the hook and get her off the God damn stage' but overzealous censors bleeped out a longer portion of her speech.
