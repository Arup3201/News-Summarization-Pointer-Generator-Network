The body of Emylee Lonczak was found in shrubbery between two homes on Madrillon Estates Drive in Vienna on Friday morning

A 16-year-old Virginia girl who was discovered dead last month had used illegal drugs with a group of people and had experienced a medical emergency before her death, it was revealed today.

Emylee Lonczak was reported missing August 21 from her home in an affluent area of McLean, Virginia.

Two days later, her body turned up in the bushes between a pair of million-dollar homes in the well-heeled suburb of Vienna.

According to a search warrant obtained by The Washington Post, the McLean High School student left home August 21 with two men and then drove out of state to buy drugs from another man.

On the morning of August 22, Lonczak's companions realized that the teen was in medical distress, but did not seek help, the document stated.

The search warrant was filed in Fairfax Circuit Court to access the Facebook accounts of the deceased girl and the men she was with on the night of her death.

Police investigating Lonczak's death had previously interviewed one of the teen's companions, identified by NBC Washington as 19-year-old Kyle Alifom, and searched his parents' Vienna home.

Alifom, who attends Marshall High School, reportedly told officials that hours before the girl died, he and Emylee attended a party together where they drank beer and smoked marijuana.

Alifom later got a ride with the girl to his home in Vienna, where Lonczak remained for several hours before taking her leave on foot.

On August 23, police bloodhounds picked up Emylee's scent in the Tysons Corner area of Vienna, and quickly tracked down her body left in the shrubbery between two homes.

So far, no arrests have been made, but police are considering charging the men involved in the incident with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

According to online records, Alifom has had at least two run-ins with the law. Most recently, he was arrested in March on a public drunkenness charge.

A year before, Alifom was collared on a count of alcohol possession.

The state medical examiner's officer has yet to determine Lonczak's cause or manner of death.

McLean High School principal Ellen Reilly sent a letter to parents about the death of Lonczak on Monday, describing her as a 'cherished student'.

'It is with great sadness that I must inform you that one of our students died unexpectedly Friday.

'Emylee Lonczak was a rising 11th grader at our school. She was a cherished student who will be greatly missed by all who knew her,' the letter said.

Police found her body in this area of Vienna near a pipe stem, hidden by bushes between two houses, after they were tipped off to her whereabouts

Bud Walker, of Fairfax County police, said: 'I can certainly understand why people 
should be concerned. What I can say is that everything that is 
involved in this case has been identified by the police.

'There are no 
outstanding people, there are no outstanding items, there is no 
outstanding information. People in that neighborhood can rest assured 
that nothing from this case is a threat to them or their children.'
