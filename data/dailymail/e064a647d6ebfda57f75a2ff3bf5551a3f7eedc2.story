There are certain tools a teacher can employ when dealing with unruly pupils, whether it’s a stern look or slightly raised voice or perhaps the threat of a detention.

But for the head of Educating the East End’s Frederick Bremer, the greatest tactic is wearing sky-high stilettos, so she can tower over the teenagers in her school.

Jenny Smith, 41, has admitted she stores several pairs of high heels under her desk in a specially designated ‘shoe cupboard’.

It means she is always several inches above even the tallest pupils in her coeducational community school.

And she said the added height helps her command respect from insolent teens, despite not having the ‘natural authority’ of a male head.

Ms Smith’s school is the subject of Educating the East End, which is Channel 4’s latest fly-on-the-wall documentary series. 

It follows Educating Essex in 2011 and Educating Yorkshire in 2013, both of which threw a spotlight on the challenges faced by teachers, the unruly behaviour of their pupils as well as stories involving personal hardships.

Educating the East End follows the same format but this time the focus is on Frederick Bremer School in Walthamstow, east London. 

Speaking ahead of episode one tonight, Ms Smith said: ‘I do think there are challenges to being female. 

'It’s a different set of challenges, not least the fact that most of the population of the school are considerably taller than me which is why I have to wear such ridiculous heels all day.

‘I think there are times when people don’t see that I have the natural authority because of my gender. Therefore it takes longer for me to assert that authority, partly because people aren’t used to female leaders, because there aren’t enough of us.’

In both the previous series the head teachers have been men. But Ms Smith said she thought it was important for students to see women in top positions.

The opening episode features scenes of despairing teachers, teenagers answering back, and even a student calling her tutor a ‘d*******’. Ms Smith is pictured sitting behind her desk at the school

She said: ‘I think it’s a tremendous asset having a strong female team in a school. It’s brilliant for our kids to have strong female role models. 

'It’s important for both the girls and the boys in this school to see women taking on jobs that aren’t usual, or that they haven’t experienced before. That was one of the reasons I was very, very keen on doing the programme.’

When Educating the East End begins tonight, it will perhaps be clear why Ms Smith and her staff might at times feel a lack of respect from the children in their care.

In the past the schools in the Educating series have been criticised for not effectively disciplining their students (pictured is a scene from the show)

At one point a young teacher named Joe Bispham declares to his class he is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, before confiding in a fellow teacher that he is thinking about leaving his job, although Ms Smith has since claimed Mr Bispham was joking.

The girls wear piercings and large amounts of make-up. And one student is seen being punished after uploading a semi-naked photo of a class-mate onto Facebook.

In the past the schools in the Educating series have been criticised for not effectively disciplining their students. 

Last year Educating Yorkshire featured scenes of out of control classrooms and gangs ruling the playground at Thornhill Community Academy.

In Educating Essex, teachers at Passmores School and Technology College were heard calling their students ‘scumbags’, while in one episode the head teacher was seen making a lewd hand gesture at his deputy.
