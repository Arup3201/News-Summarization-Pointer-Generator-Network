Traditional missions to Mars involve large rockets for both blasting off and slowing down.

However, researchers believe there may be a simpler, cheaper way.

Rather than blasting to the red planet and using rockets to slow themselves down, future craft could simply use planetary gravity fields to 'drift' into the Martian atmosphere.

Called ballistic capture, the new method could help open the Martian frontier for more robotic missions, future manned expeditions and even colonization efforts, researchers say - and even Nasa is interested.

Traditional missions use rockets to shoot for the location Mars will be in its orbit where the spacecraft will meet it - known as a Hohmann transfer.

The new method puts the spacecraft into a Mars-like orbit so that it flies ahead of the planet, slowing down until it is pulled to the surface by the gravitational force.

While launch and cruise costs remain the same, the large, complex burn to slow down and hit the planet at the perfect speed is not needed.

Once at the red planet, Mars' own gravitational field could catch hold and pull them down.

Called ballistic capture, it could help open the Martian frontier for more robotic missions, future manned expeditions and even colonization efforts, researchers say - and even Nasa is interested. 

'It's an eye-opener,' James Green, director of Nasa's Planetary Science Division, told Scientific American.

'It could be a pretty big step for us and really save us resources and capability, which is always what we're looking for.'

'That's the magic of ballistic capture—it's like flying in formation,' says Edward Belbruno, a longtime Nasa employee and expert, and co-author, with Francesco Topputo of the Polytechnic University of Milan of the new paper, posted on arXiv, and submitted to the journal Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy. 

'We construct a new type of transfer from the Earth to Mars, which ends in ballistic capture,' the pair wrote. 

In 1990 Belbruno applied his ideas for low energy transfer orbits to the Japanese lunar probe Hiten, which had been designed only for lunar swing-by and had suffered a failure of the Hagoromo lunar orbiter. 

The main Hiten probe lacked the fuel to enter lunar orbit using a conventional Hohmann transfer trajectory, but Belbruno was able to devise a ballistic capture trajectory that would put it in lunar orbit using only a negligible amount of fuel. 

The probe entered lunar orbit in 1991, the first time that Belbruno's ideas had been put to the test.

'This results in a substantial savings in capture from that of a classical Hohmann transfer under certain conditions. 

'This transfer type may be of interest for Mars missions because of lower capture costs, moderate flight time, and flexibility of launch period from the Earth.' 

'This new class of transfers to Mars offers new mission possibilities for Mars missions.'

The method could one day be used for manned missions to Mars - although it would add several months to mission times.

Belbruno worked out how to let the competing gravities of Earth, the sun and moon gently pull a spacecraft into a desired lunar orbit. 

All three bodies can be thought of as creating bowl-like depressions in spacetime. 

By lining up the trajectory of a spacecraft through those bowls, such that momentum slackens along the route, a spacecraft can just 'roll' down at the end into the moon's small bowl, easing into orbit fuel-free. 

'It's a delicate dance,' Belbruno said.

Current missions use rocket to slow themselves as they approach planets

New, slower mission would be gradually 'grabbed' by martian gravity

Would add several months to mission - but make it cheaper
