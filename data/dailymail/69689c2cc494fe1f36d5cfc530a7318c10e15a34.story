For years a blurry picture of a woman posing with a parasol was believed to be Mary Bowser, the slave turned Union spy during the civil war.

But after several years of researching the elusive spy, who worked undercover as a slave in the Confederate White House, a historian and novelist has revealed the truth behind the picture.

As Lois Leveen researched her historical novel The Secrets of Mary Bowser, she was intrigued by the only image said to be of the Union spy.

Mystery: For years this picture of a woman named Mary Bowser was believed to be of a Union spy

Few details are known about the African American woman, who was freed by the Van Lew family in Richmond, Virginia, who sent her to the North to be educated.

The Civil War era diary of the Union spy Elizabeth Van Lew recalls how an African American named Mary had been a vital source of information.

About 50 years after the war, which ran between 1861 and 1865, Van Lew's niece identified the woman as Bowser.

'Mary was exceptionally intelligent, and displayed some acting skills,' according to The Guardian Express. 'Hoping to gain access to secret information, she became “Ellen Bond”, a dim-witted, crazy, but very able servant.' 

Because slaves were assumed to be illiterate and background characters, Bowser was able to listen in on vital conversations by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his men.

As she cleaned meeting rooms she was also able to examine documents and pass on details to the Van Lew family.

Clues: The original photograph was found to have been taken about 40 years after the Civil War

Misleading: The woman in the photograph was named Mary Bowser, but the picture was not of the spy

The first time a picture of Bowser was linked to her stories of espionage was in 2002, when a radio station's website ran the photo, crediting it to 'James A. Chambers, U.S. Army Deputy, Office of the Chief, Military Intelligence'.

But, as Leveen researched her book she became suspicious of the authenticity of the picture.

'My doubts about the image grew when I 
unearthed several post-war sources corroborating Bowser's participation 
in the Richmond espionage ring,' she told The Atlantic.

'One of these documents indicates that in
June of 1867, the slave-turned-spy, then using the surname Garvin, left
the U.S. for the West Indies; after that date, she disappears from the 
historical record.'

Leveen added that the dress and furniture in the photograph appeared to be from a later era.

She finally traced the original picture to the Library of Virginia, where the origins of the photograph were stated as Petersburg Studio C. R. Rees.

Rees began taken the cabinet style of picture, like the one said to be of Mary Bowser, in 1860, but did not open a studio in Pertersburg, Virginia, until 1880, making it unlikely that the woman in the photo was the spy.

A few months later, Leveen was given the chance to view the original, which would finally confirm if the picture was of the spy.

'This is the moment a historian lives for - cradling a rare primary source in hand. And it was just as informative as I'd hoped,' Leveen said.

Historical fact: Lois Leveen tracked down the truth behind the picture after writing about Mary Bowser's life

The back of the cabinet card captioned the photograph as Mary Bowser, and the name was repeated on the address on the back.

But, the date of the photograph was 1900, when Bowser would have been about 60.

Leveen pointed out that whoever cropped the original photograph, when it started circulating on the internet as being the spy, had removed the critical date proving it was of the wrong person.

She added that the lack of a picture of Bowser was a valuable insight into American history.

'Americans of all backgrounds contributed to our history. But the enormous holes in what we have of [Bowser's] biography remind us that gender, race, and class also shaped how millions of Americans went unrecorded,' she said.

Missing: Lois Leveen says the lack of a photograph is a reminder of how slaves were written out of history

'Wanting to commemorate an African American woman who played such a dramatic part in the Civil War is laudable. Expecting to have a photograph of her was borderline ludicrous.'

In 1995 the government honored Bowser's efforts by inducting her in the U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps hall of fame.

Her efforts were described as: 'a highly dangerous mission to the great benefit of the Union effort. She was one of the highest placed and most productive espionage agents of the Civil War. … Jefferson Davis never discovered the leak in his household staff, although he knew the Union somehow kept discovering Confederate plans.'
