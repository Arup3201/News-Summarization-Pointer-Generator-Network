Allegations: Lord Mandelson received the cash from a firm to funnel income from speaking engagements

Peter Mandelson has been accused of slashing his tax bill by giving himself a £400,000 loan.

The Labour grandee received the cash from a company he set up to funnel income from his book and public speaking engagements.

Instead of withdrawing the money in salary or dividend payments, which would have to be taxed, the former business secretary chose to receive it as a loan from the company of which he is the sole shareholder.

According to accounts filed at Companies House, Lord Mandelson’s firm, Willbury Limited, gave him a £400,000 loan in the 2013/14 financial year.

Provided that a minimum rate of interest specified by HM Revenue & Customs is charged, the borrowing is not liable to be taxed.

At the time of the loan, the official interest rate was 3.25 per cent.

Director’s loans can be used legally to delay the payment of tax on income – potentially indefinitely.

The accounts for Lord Mandelson’s company, which was set up two weeks after the 2010 general election, show it charged £15,211 in interest on the balance.

But no repayments were made, nor was any repayment schedule or loan term set out.

Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and director of Tax Research UK, said that it was likely the loan was being used as a way of avoiding tax.

‘How to extract cash from small companies whilst paying as little tax as possible on the way is a massive part of the UK tax avoidance industry,’ he told The Guardian.

‘Directors taking loans from companies they own is one way in which this is done, which has been widely condemned in the past when done by footballers and others.

‘It’s just about impossible to think this is motivated by anything but tax avoidance.

'All politicians, including members of the House of Lords, should not only be seen to comply with the spirit of the law on tax but should be required to do so as a condition of holding office.’

A spokesman for Lord Mandelson said: ‘[Willbury Limited] oversees all of Lord Mandelson’s writing, public speaking, broadcasting and personal commercial undertakings.

‘It pays all relevant UK corporate taxes and Lord Mandelson pays all relevant personal taxes.’
