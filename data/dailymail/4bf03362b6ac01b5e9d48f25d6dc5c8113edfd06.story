A mother who gave birth on a Manhattan sidewalk described her baby's dramatic arrival - and how one impatient New Yorker pinched the cab she was trying to take to hospital. 

Polly McCourt, 39, went into labor at around 4pm on Monday and was being helped to the street corner by her doorman Anton Rudovic  to hail a taxi.

However when they got to the corner of East 68th Street and Third Avenue - a woman jumped in front of her and stole the cab.

Mrs McCourt, who is originally from Oxfordshire in the UK, said: 'He [the doorman] was trying desperately to hail a cab and a lady walked out five meters in front of him and hailed a cab and got into it.

'And I went ''that's my cab, I want that cab!'''

With the baby's head already crowning, Mrs McCourt gave up trying to get to nearby Lenox Hill Hospital and sat down on the sidewalk. 

With doorman Mr Rudovic supporting her back and female bystanders holding the baby's head, the newborn arrived in under five minutes. People rushed to give their scarves and coats to wrap the baby as the temperature was in the chilly mid-30s.

Mrs McCourt's husband Cian McCourt, 40, who was stuck in traffic, told MailOnline today that he feared the worst when he came running up and saw his wife on the ground.

Mr McCourt, a partner at A&L Goodbody law firm, said: 'It was a complete shock. I came running up the street and I immediately knew it was my wife.

'I saw the crowd and I feared the worst, that she had been knocked down or something - it was really emotional.

'Then I saw the baby 
already in her arms. She was covered in scarves, shirts and coats, the people 
who helped were great.'

Cian McCourt told MailOnline today that he was extremely grateful to the bystanders who helped his wife

The mother-of-three is recovering with her healthy baby girl Ila Isabelle and is due to leave hospital today.

Mr McCourt said that his wife and new daughter, who weighs around 7lb, 'were doing great'.

Mr
 McCourt, who is originally from Dublin in Ireland, said they wanted to get in touch with a woman named Isabelle.

They were so grateful 
for her kind gesture of giving up her coat that they named their baby 
after her.

Mrs McCourt said: 'She was meant to be Ila Polly... but now she's Ila Isabelle. We're very happy with it.'

The
 couple also have a son Conor, six, and a four-year-old daughter Adele.

Mr McCourt said today that his son was aware of his new sister's dramatic arrival but was 'very blasé' about the whole thing.
