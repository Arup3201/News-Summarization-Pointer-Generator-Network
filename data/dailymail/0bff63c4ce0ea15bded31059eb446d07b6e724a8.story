Criticism: David Loughton, chief executive of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust

The NHS boss threatening to sack a whistleblower has spent more than £6million of taxpayers’ money getting rid of staff who raised the alarm about poor care in his hospitals.

David Loughton, who has earned £400,000 this year as chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust, last night faced calls to resign after details emerged of his attempts to drive out whistleblowers.

It was revealed earlier this week that Mr Loughton oversaw threats to punish a whistleblower for warning that his hospital was fiddling its death rate figures.

Sandra Haynes Kirkbright was suspended after claiming the hospital was manipulating records.

She was sent a threatening letter saying she had breached her contract by talking to the Daily Mail – despite repeated assurances from the Government and NHS bosses that whistleblowers will be protected.

Last night, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt vowed to support whistleblowers and praised the Mail.‘In light of the Daily Mail’s recent reporting it’s important to be absolutely clear that whistleblowers speaking out about poor care must be confident they will be listened to,’ he said.

‘An independent review will now establish the facts in this case. We need an open culture in the NHS where staff feel supported to raise concerns. Anything less is unacceptable.’

NHS bosses also announced there would be a ‘swift’ independent inquiry into Mr Loughton’s treatment of whistleblowers by the NHS Trust Development Authority, which monitors hospital performance. It will be conducted by human rights lawyer Lucy Scott-Moncrieff, the former president of the Law Society.

The Mail can now reveal that Mr Loughton has spent millions in public money cracking down on staff who raise concerns in the public interest.

He was forced to resign in shame from his previous job after his hospital was rated the worst in the country and was chastised for vilifying whistleblowers.

Mr Loughton has faced intense criticism this week after his trust wrote to whistleblower Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, 50, warning that she faced the sack for raising serious concerns about the hospital to the Mail in March last year.

Mrs Haynes Kirkbright only spoke out after repeatedly raising concerns with bosses that death figures were being manipulated.

After talking to the Mail, she was suspended and Mr Loughton wrote to her in December warning she faced disciplinary action for blowing the whistle. Mr Hunt intervened personally in her case, demanding all action against Mrs Haynes Kirkbright be frozen.

Last night, politicians and campaigners called for Mr Loughton to be sacked. Tory MP and former health minister Simon Burns spoke out against Mr Loughton in the Commons in 2002.

Last night, he said: ‘It is a disgrace. It is incomprehensible that someone who was removed from their job 12 years ago because of their attitude to whistleblowers and poor performance should then, like a revolving door, end up working again in the NHS on a high salary.

He should consider his position.’

As chief executive of Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry in the late 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, Mr Loughton openly spoke of a ‘hit list’ of five of his staff whom he was determined to get rid of.

At the time, his trust was given the worst ever rating by watchdog the Commission for Health Improvement. It was found to have been overcrowding  wards. 

The excess death rate for non-emergency patients is said to have been 60 per cent – more than double that of Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust at the height of the hospital scandal in 2005-2008.

Mr Loughton suspended two top surgeons who spoke out about high death rates. Alban Barros D’Sa, a leading surgeon, was accused of serious professional misconduct in 1999 after whistleblowing to bosses about a colleague’s worrying number of patient deaths.

But Mr Loughton would not give him his job back because he had displayed a ‘lack of confidence in the chief executive’.

Mr Loughton fought the case to the High Court twice and lost. After a 20-month legal battle, which cost the taxpayer £250,000, Mr Barros D’Sa, who is now 77, was cleared by an independent panel and given his job back.

Heart surgeon Raj Mattu was also suspended after speaking out repeatedly to his bosses about overcrowding causing deaths at the hospital.

Mr Mattu claims Mr Loughton tried to bribe him to leave quietly, but he says he rejected the offer. This claim has not yet been proven.

The surgeon was suspended in February 2002 and, in the longest running case of its kind, which has cost more than £6million, he is still fighting at tribunal.

David Loughton has earned £400,000 this year despite a history of failing patients and suppressing whistleblowers.

Records show the chief executive of Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust is paid a salary of £209,000 – more than eight times the average taken home by his staff.

After turning 60 in January, he now also gets a bonus tax free lump sum of up to £195,000 from his £1.5million NHS pension.

The pay package has emerged despite damning inspection reports and political anger over his performance running hospitals.

Mr Loughton, who lives with wife Deborah and their two children in a £800,000 detached property outside Warwick, has worked as an NHS chief executive for 27 years.

But over that time he has faced intense criticism for his ‘aggressive and bullying’ manner in covering up scandals to the detriment of patient safety.

After working as a local manager, Mr Loughton was made chief executive of Coventry’s Walsgrave Hospital in the mid-80s.

He ran it for 17 years, during which time he was accused in Parliament of ‘completely ruining a trust and the provision of health care in an area’.

Former watchdog the Commission for Health Improvement gave the hospital a ‘zero star rating’ in 2001.

Excess death rates for non-emergency patients were worse than those seen during the Mid Staffordshire scandal and serious concerns were raised about overcrowding.

The suppression of whistleblowers was also highlighted in a report, with bosses accused of creating a ‘culture of fear’ in which ‘doctors fear being victimised for voicing concerns’.

Despite the criticisms, Mr Loughton’s earnings increased by more than 15 per cent to £128,000 after the report was published.

Friend Gary Reay, who was chairman of the Walsgrave NHS Hospitals Trust until 2001, said Mr Loughton would get rid of anyone who crossed him, comparing him to former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

‘Like Fergie when Jaap Stam, Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Roy Keane started getting too big for their boots, David would get rid of anybody he considered a threat, unproductive or disloyal. He had no compulsion moving them out,’ he said.

‘What I liked about him was he was very hard working and had a good sense of humour, and nobody f***** him over. He’s an in-your-face tough guy who could, if you let him, bully.

‘This woman [Mrs Haynes Kirkbright] better watch out because once he’s marked her card he’ll be after her. He’s an unforgiving b******.’

In November 2001, seven cross-party MPs called on then health secretary John Hutton to sack Mr Loughton following the damning watchdog report and accusations of bullying whistleblowers.

Former North Warwickshire MP Mike O’Brien said: ‘There are a lot of excellent staff at the Walsgrave hospital who are doing a great job looking after patients, but they are handicapped by Mr Loughton’s increasingly desperate struggle to hold on to his own job.’

He added: ‘There is no confidence in Mr Loughton.’

Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry North West, said Mr Loughton was ‘impossible to reason with’ and ‘arrogant and dismissive’.
