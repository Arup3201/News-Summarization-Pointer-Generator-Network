Out with the old and in with the new. Warren Gatland’s loyalty towards his British and Irish Lions has at times been painfully frustrating but the Wales coach insists his starting XV for Saturday’s Test against Australia has been picked purely on form.

Fresh faces have been included in place of some ageing veterans, who may well have passed their peak.

It could signal the turning point as Wales bid to end a run of 20 straight defeats against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa — the southern hemisphere’s ‘big three’.

Warren Gatland has dropped four of his most experienced players for Saturday's Test against Australia 

Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb will start against the Wallabies in place of veteran number nine Mike Philips 

Adam Jones, the 95-cap tighthead prop, was left out of the squad completely, while 42-cap Bradley Davies and the Lions duo of Gethin Jenkins and Mike Phillips have been named on the bench.

In come Samson Lee, 21, Jake Ball, 23, Rhys Webb, 25, and Paul James, who is 32 but enjoying a new lease of life with Bath. ‘The criticism that has been levelled at me in the past is that I’ve been stubborn and not made changes,’ said Gatland.

‘So if you look at Webb and Dan Biggar, they’ve been the form nine and 10 for the Ospreys and they’ve been selected on form.

‘For us, there is a lot of logic in the decisions we have made and we are pretty excited and positive about the selection. From my point of view, they are pretty justifiable.’

There was an air of inevitability about the head coach’s press conference at the Vale Resort yesterday. Having not beaten a southern hemisphere side since the 21-18 win against the Wallabies in 2008, questions about ‘psychological barriers’ have become commonplace over the last few series of autumn internationals.

After that last victory, Gatland said his side were carrying the flag for the northern hemisphere. Six years later and the flag is at half mast. There have been moments of celebration — notably two Grand Slams, a World Cup semi-final and, most recently, a heavily Wales-influenced Lions Test series victory — but that all seemed like distant memories after this summer’s 38-16 thumping by South Africa in Durban.

‘Our primary focus over the next 12 months has to be getting out of our group in the World Cup,’ said Gatland. ‘Although we want to do exceptionally well in the autumn and Six Nations and those are important games for us, the long-term objective is getting out of that group and making the quarter-finals.’

Some of Gatland’s newer faces will not carry the fear that becomes engrained by defeat after defeat and this weekend is the best opportunity for a major autumn scalp. Australia have a new coach, Michael Cheika, following their recent off-field controversies, and looked slack defensively in their narrow victory over the Barbarians on Saturday.

Gatland, however, will not be caught cold.

Halfpenny; Cuthbert, North, Roberts, Williams; Biggar, Webb; James, Hibbard, Lee; Ball, A W Jones; Lydiate, Warburton (capt), Faletau. 

Subs: Baldwin, Jenkins, R Jones, Davies, Tipuric, Phillips, Priestland, Allen. 

‘You can’t underestimate them,’ said Gatland. ‘A lot of people have been talking about what’s happened with Kurtley Beale (he was fined £24,600 for sending an offensive picture message to an Australian Rugby Union female team official) and those sorts of things. Does that make them more vulnerable? With Australians, it makes them stronger. So we are expecting a really tough game.’

Outside centre Tevita Kuridrani keeps his place in the Wallaby XV and the 23-year-old’s showdown with George North, filling in for the injured Jonathan Davies, will be one of the most significant head-to-heads.

Gatland has complete faith in North’s ability, even suggesting a longer-term move for the Northampton wing.

‘There are a lot of class players who started on the wing and moved to the centre,’ said Gatland. 

‘There are two prime examples in Tana Umaga and Ma’a Nonu. So it’s an option for us (to make North’s long-term position centre). But it’s one position we feel we’ve got a bit of strength in depth in.’
