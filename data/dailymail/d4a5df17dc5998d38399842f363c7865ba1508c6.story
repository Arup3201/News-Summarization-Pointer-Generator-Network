Arturo Vidal has told Manchester United he is happy at Juventus as the January transfer window approaches.

The Chilean, who was heavily linked with a move to United in the summer, stayed put in Serie A, and is 'calm' at the Italian side with Juventus top of the league with just one defeat this season.

Louis van Gaal's priority in the transfer window should be a defender, but the Dutchman could continue his spending spree with a luxury player elsewhere.

'I feel content and happy here,' Vidal told Chilean radio station Cooperativa. 'This is my fourth year here and I feel right at home.

'Things have gone really well and we are returning to play at the maximum level.

'I am very happy with our results. There are always transfer rumours but I am calm.

'When a transfer window is about to open there are always reports but I never think about that, I have an agent that takes care of that.

'I'm only thinking about Juventus. I am 100 per cent, giving my all in training in order to become one of the best.'

Vidal earlier revealed he is still struggling with the knee injury that plagued him towards the end of last season.

He was forced to undergo knee surgery in May but returned in time to help Chile reach the last 16 of the World Cup - despite failing to complete a full 90 minutes in Brazil.

'The knee caused - and is causing - me problems,' Vidal told reporters after Juventus' 2-1 derby win over Torino in Serie A on Sunday. 'But I'm trying to get in top shape.'

Louis van Gaal may dip into the transfer market in January... and not just for a defender
