Winston Churchill's powerful speeches have long been credited with helping to win the war, but one leading academic says there is 'little evidence' his oratory inspired the British to beat Nazi Germany.

Professor Richard Toye also claims that the Second World War leader's 'finest hour' radio address, one of his most famous, lacked impact 'because many
 people thought that he was drunk'.

The University of Exeter academic claims in a new book that Churchill was not a decisive influence on the nation's willingness to fight on
 against Hitler when Britain was almost on its knees in 1940.

His research also found that when Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942, one Londoner said his rallying speech was 'f****** bull****' and a 'f****** cover-up'.

PM: After the war was won, Winston Churchill addresses a crowd of 20,000 at Walthamstow Stadium, London, but an academic has cast doubt on the effect Winston Churchill's wartime speeches had on the British public in a new book

Churchill's legendary oratory, which included unforgettable phrases like 'we shall fight on 
the beaches' and 'never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by 
so many to so few', had moved many to join up and fight the Nazis.

But Professor Toye denies the traditional view 
that Churchill was universally loved and said his speeches had led to 
criticism and controversy.

'Churchill's first speeches as prime minister in the dark days of 1940 were by no means universally acclaimed,' he said.

'Many
 people thought that he was drunk during his famous "finest hour" 
broadcast and there is little evidence that they made a decisive 
difference to the British people's will to fight on.'

Well-qualified: Exeter academic Richard Toye, who is an expert on Churchill, looks in detail at how people reacted to his speeches in his book, The Roar of the Lion

Prof Toye's new book - The Roar Of The Lion - examines government documents and surveys, as well as the diaries of ordinary people.

He used both the Home intelligence reports and the mass observational archives to analyse what people thought of Churchill's speeches at the time and separate that reaction from what people later remembered or thought they remembered their reactions to be.

And he admitted that even he was surprised by the results.

He said: 'I thought the established story was completely true I simply thought one had to check it out and find confirmatory evidence for it, I even thought it might be rather dull.

'But when I actually started analysing the records I realised that I wasn't finding the established story that I was expecting.

'I'm not saying Churchill's speeches were bad speeches but people often got depressed by them and that is perfectly understandable because they were often conveying very sobering messages.

'In July and August 1940 we do genuinely find people being excited by his speeches but this feeling then gets projected throughout the whole period and it's actually much more complicated than that.

'I would argue that by the summer of 1940 moral had actually improved on account of the British action in Africa and that bucked everybody up.

'That fact that moral had gone up improved the reception which Churchill's speeches got rather than his speeches improving moral.

'The material I used has all be around but no-one has ever looked at it for these purposes before - to systematically analyse the public response to Churchill's speeches.'

One of the most vivid accounts was written by a journalist who had joined the Army and had written down in shorthand the comments of his friend George, a 24-year-old French polisher from south London.

Hero: Sir Winston is regarded by many as the man who saved Britain from the clutches of Hitler's Nazi Germany

As George listened to Churchill's speech on the fall of Singapore in February 1942, he reportedly said: 'F****** bulls***. Get on with it. What a f****** cover-up. Any normal person could see it's just pulling the wool over their eyes.'

Prof Toye, who works in the Department of History at the University of Exeter, said: 'There was a complexity to people's reactions to Churchill's speeches at the time, as the evidence shows that they may have liked one bit of a speech and not another section, or liked some speeches but not others.

'People sometimes changed their minds following discussions with friends or after reading newspaper commentaries.

'There was not a blanket acceptance and positive reaction. A more measured response to his speeches is in evidence. This is possibly why the speeches didn't always have the effect now credited to them.'

Prof Toye said Churchill's famous 'We shall fight them on the beaches' speech of June 1940 was to the House of Commons, and never broadcast, but people convinced themselves they heard it.

'It was never broadcast, though it was reported on the BBC by an announcer and quoted in the press,' he said.

'However, people claim to remember having heard this famous speech from June 1940, even though they hadn't.

'It was recorded for posterity along with others of his wartime speeches nine years later.'

Mr Toye has some academic pedigree, after a PhD from Cambridge, his book Lloyd George and Churchill: Rivals for Greatness, won him awards, including The Times Higher Young Academic Author of the Year Award in 2007. 

Three years later he wrote the book: Churchill's Empire: The World that Made Him and the World He Made.

May 13 1940 in his first address as Prime Minister:'I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined the government: "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat."

'We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy?

'I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark and lamentable catalogue of human crime.

'That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: victory; victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.'

June 4 1940 following the evacuation of forces from Dunkirk:'We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.

'We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing-grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills.We shall never surrender!'

June 18 1940 following the collapse of France to Nazi forces:'Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilisation. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire.

'The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this island or lose the war. If we can stand up to him, all Europe may be free and the life of the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands.

'But if we fail, then the whole world, including the United States, including all that we have known and cared for, will sink into the abyss of a new Dark Age made more sinister, and perhaps more protracted, by the lights of perverted science.

'Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years, men will still say, "This was their Finest Hour."'August 20 1940 in tribute to the RAF:'The gratitude of every home in our island, in our Empire, and indeed throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British airmen who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger, are turning the tide of the world war by their prowess and by their devotion.

'Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.'September 9 1941 on Britain's increasing strength in battle:'The mood of Britain is wisely and rightly averse from every form of shallow or premature exultation.

'This is no time for boasts or glowing prophecies, but there is thisâ€”a year ago our position looked forlorn, and well nigh desperate, to all eyes but our own. Today we may say aloud before an awe-struck world, "We are still masters of our fate. We still are captain of our souls."'November 10 1942 following the victory at El Alameinin, North Africa: 'The Germans have received back again that measure of fire and steel which they have so often meted out to others. Now this is not the end.

'It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.'
