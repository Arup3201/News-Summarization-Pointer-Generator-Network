Shamed former energy secretary Chris Huhne had to wear make-up to disguise a black eye his ex-wife gave him, it was claimed yesterday.

Vicky Pryce repeatedly punched the then Lib Dem minister and dragged him through a window during an attack at their £2.5 million townhouse, a neighbour said.

Constance Briscoe said Miss Pryce, a former government economic adviser, was devastated because Mr Huhne had left her for his bisexual aide Carina Trimingham.

'Punch-up': According to Constance Briscoe, Vicky Pryce, left, attacked Chris Huhne, right, in their £2.5million townhouse in Clapham, south west London

'Relations with men': Chris Huhne, pictured right at the 2010 general election, allegedly gave Vicky Pryce, left, an STD. Pryce also allegedly said their marriage collapsed because he had had gay relationships in the past

She said the senior economist had 
likened Mr Huhne’s lover to a man, and had claimed he had had gay  
relationships. She added: ‘Vicky’s attitude was that Chris had run off 
with a man.’

Miss Pryce wanted to give a ‘tell-all’ newspaper interview, former confidante Briscoe said.

Briscoe,
 Britain’s best known black female judge, was giving evidence in her own
 defence against accusations she lied to police over her role in the 
speeding points scandal which led to both Mr Huhne and Miss Pryce being 
jailed.

She told Southwark 
Crown Court she had believed Miss Pryce should go ahead with the 
newspaper interview because it would be ‘good therapy’.

Briscoe,
 56, said Miss Pryce had told her in 2003 that Mr Huhne had asked her to
 take his speeding points to avoid losing his driving licence.

She
 said: ‘At that time I thought it was in the public interest for Chris 
to have to give an account of himself. I felt he was a bit of a 
hypocrite.

Claims: Constance Briscoe, pictured left at court today, revealed details of alleged conversations with Vicky Pryce, right

‘He was a 
politician playing fast and loose with speeding points. He was 
expressing ambitions to become deputy prime minister and he was telling 
lies.’

Briscoe, a former 
barrister and part-time judge, said she knew Miss Pryce because they 
lived on the same affluent Georgian estate in Clapham, south west 
London, and their children were friends.

She told the court that Miss Pryce did not mention the speeding points again until after their marriage break-up in 2010.

Following
 the split, Briscoe said the whole street  witnessed a furious argument 
between the pair, dubbed the ‘double punch-up black eye make-up 
episode’.

Affair: Hune, right, left Vicky Pryce for his bisexual lover Carina Trimingham, left

She said: ‘Chris 
had come back to the crescent to see Vicky and she punched him and 
blackened his eye. I saw it, the whole of the crescent saw it. She 
dragged him through a window and punched him a few times in the eye.

‘Vicky
 had given him quite a few good punches and it had landed well. He had 
to cover it up because he was on telly all the time.

'Family values': Briscoe told jurors that Pryce was angry with Chris Huhne for conducting a campaign based on family values while having an affair. Pictured is an election campaign leaflet showing a Huhne family photograph

‘When Chris had driven round to go back out [of the crescent], she punched him again – that was the double punch-up.’

It
 was not made clear if Briscoe was referring to Miss Pryce dragging Mr 
Huhne through a car window, although at least one punch appears to have 
been thrown while he was driving. Briscoe said Miss Pryce had wanted to 
speak to a journalist from The Mail on Sunday but believed Mr Huhne had 
bugged their home and hacked her emails, so asked her neighbour to act 
as her intermediary.

The 
lawyer said she forwarded emails and messages between the Greek-born 
economist and journalists Andrew Alderson and Dave Dillon.

Briscoe,
 a former Samaritans counsellor, added: ‘Apart from the breakdown of the
 relationship and blaming Chris Huhne’s sexuality, she wanted to discuss
 the fact that Chris had had relationships with men before they got 
married and all of that.

‘She
 also wanted to discuss when he had infected her with a sexually 
transmitted disease when he was a Euro MEP, and when she had confronted 
him with that, he said he got it from clean sheets in a hotel.’

Briscoe
 told the jury she had acted as an intermediary in discussions with The 
Mail on Sunday, but was not involved with Miss Pryce’s dealings with The
 Sunday Times.

A police 
investigation was launched in 2011 after both newspapers ran allegations
 that Mr Huhne had asked a family member to take his speeding points, 
and the subsequent scandal led to the MP’s resignation.

Mr Huhne and Miss Pryce were each jailed for eight months last year.

Briscoe
 is charged with  perverting the course of  justice by making 
‘inaccurate and misleading’ witness statements, and of falsifying a  
document. She denies the allegations, but has been  suspended from the 
judiciary since her arrest in 2012.

The trial continues.
