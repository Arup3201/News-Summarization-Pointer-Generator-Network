She's come a long way from finishing third on the BBC’s Saturday night talent show I’d Do Anything.

Five years later, Samantha Barks is well on the road to becoming a Hollywood star – with, perhaps, a Hollywood superstar on her arm to boot.

Miss Barks, 22, has been linked romantically with 48-year-old Russell Crowe, her co-star in the film Les Miserables.

Miss Barks has previously spoken about how she hit it off with Mr Crowe during filming of the musical.

She said in one interview: ‘We had the best time hanging out. It was awesome.’

Mr
 Crowe has also written about the actress and singer on his Twitter 
account revealing he had been ‘working out’ with her including a ‘4km 
walk, 30 mins elliptical, 4 mins prone hold, shoulder routine, lats, 
bench, Turkish stand’.

He also complimented her before her appearance at the Oscars on the social networking site.

He wrote: ‘Last tech rehearsals for the Big O done...next up...showtime..@SamanthaBarks will be looking amazing tonight, worth tuning in just for that.’

Miss Barks shared one of her own moments with Crowe on Instagram which showed the pair ‘having boxing lessons’ on set.

In January she also revealed told how the the pair have performed together. She said ‘Russell and I actually do gigs - I gig with his band so I speak him a lot.’

She added: ‘It’s very cool. We’ve done a few gigs in New York so far but whenever we’re all free, we all just love to have a little jam...it’s wicked.’

Despite the couple’s obvious closeness her family last night denied they are romantically involved.

Speaking from his home in Laxey, Isle of Man, Richard Barks said the pair were friendly but not in a relationship together.

Mr Crowe split up with his wife of nine years Danielle Spencer, 43, in October. The couple have two children.
