A cast of women aged between 65 and 92 have been chosen to model the new Karen Walker eyewear collection.

The New Zealand-based designer enlisted the help of New Yorker Ari Seth Cohen, the photographer behind hit fashion book and blog Advanced Style, to help select and shoot the four seniors.

Joyce Carpati, Linda Rodin, Lynn Dell and Ilona Royce Smithkin were all photographed in their own homes (against some rather extraordinary wallpapers) in statement shades from Ms Walker's latest eyewear offering.

Unique style: One-time opera singer Joyce Carpati, 80, (left) wears her hair in braids, while Ilona Royce Smithkin, 92, (right), is distinctive for her vibrant orange crop

They certainly make for sensational 
models, working the vintage-inspired shapes and bold hues to better 
effect than many of the current crop of catwalk models.

Joyce
Carpati, 80, from New York City, for example, wears her 
glitter-embellished shades with effortless nonchalance. In another 
frame, she makes a fan-shaped headpiece look easy to pull off.

Ilona
Royce Smithkin, 92, is distinctive for her vibrant orange crop - and 
the fact that she could be decades younger than her years.

The acclaimed artist and performer shows
no fear of clashing hues, teaming a red feather boa with a neon yellow
pair of frames, or a colorful polka dot cardigan with oversized pink 
shades.

Sense of play: Stylist Linda Rodin, 65, carries herself with the elegance of a supermodel

Fun with color: Dell works a monochrome turban and scarlet lipstick (left) while Rodin strikes a pose in a searing orange pair of frames (right)

Stylist Linda Rodin, 65, carries 
herself with the elegance of a supermodel, though each of her looks have
a brilliant sense of play.

And boutique-owner Lynn Dell, 78, is pure glamor in her turban headbands, scarlet lipstick and glossy dark gray locks.

The idea behind the campaign is to demonstrate that 'Karen Walker is for everybody, of all ages,' a press release explains.

From sophisticated to sensational: Carpati in tortoiseshell and leopard (left) and Royce Smithkin in a red feather boa with a neon yellow pair of frames (right)

Showstopping signatures: Carpati makes a fan-shaped headpiece look easy to pull off (left), Rodin works octagonal frames with a sequined top (right)

It certainly doesn't hurt that Ms Walker is a huge fan of Mr Cohen's work.

'What I've always loved about Ari's images, and his ladies, is the sense
of looking to the future rather than the past,' she says in the release.

'There's an optimism and excitement for the moment in his women
that I applaud.'
