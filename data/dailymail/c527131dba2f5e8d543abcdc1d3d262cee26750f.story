Roy Hodgson insists he did not mean to cause offence by making his ill-judged comment about Wayne Rooney's Scouse accent – because his wife is from Liverpool.

The England manager was defending his captain's ability to get his message across to the players when he said: 'Everyone knows Wayne is not the sort of person, with his Liverpool accent, who is going to be able to stand up in front of a lecture room of people.

'But he doesn't need to. All he has to do is make certain the players he is talking to understand where he is coming from.' Hodgson, in his pre-match press conference ahead of England facing San Marino on Thursday night, revealed that he offered an apology to Rooney.

Roy Hodgson says he did not mean to cause offence when he commented about Wayne Rooney's accent

Hodgson said: 'Wayne knows I would never wish to offend him or anyone from Liverpool – my wife is from there.

'I apologised to him for the headlines but he didn't even want one. And I've had no problem with my wife.' 

With Kevin Pietersen's allegations of bullying in the England cricket dressing room still fresh in the public consciousness, Hodgson was quick to point out that he has never had any such issues with the Three Lions and insisted the spirit within the dressing room was good.

Hodgson was also quick to add that team spirit within the England squad dressing room is good

The England boss (centre) added that he has never had an issue during his two years in charge to date

'I've been very lucky in the two years or so that I've had the privilege of leading the team. I must say I've haven't noticed any problems like that,' he said.

'I'm not particularly patting myself on the back or anyone on the back because dressing rooms can be very difficult places.'

He added: 'We haven't had that problem, we work very hard not to have that problem and we are working very hard at the moment to make sure that we are all singing off the same hymn sheet, that we are taking ownership of what we're trying to do.

Hodgson also revealed his delight at the form of Danny Welbeck leading up to England's two European Championship qualifiers. 

The form of Danny Welbeck since his £16million move to Arsenal has also pleased Hodgson

The 23-year-old scored his first professional hat-trick for Arsenal against Galatasaray earlier in the month and Hodgson is happy to see him hitting form with Daniel Sturridge absent due to injury.

'There have been periods and moments when for him it has not always been easy because he hasn't got an enormous amount of game time and he's had to spend a lot of time waiting for his chance,' he said.

'It's great now that he's made his move and he's one of the first names on the team sheet and I'm pleased for him.

'But he's taken that chance by playing well in the games he's done so far.'

Rooney was also quick to praise his former Manchester United team-mate, hailing the Gunners' striker qualities.

'Daniel is a fantastic footballer and sometimes he doesn't get the credit he deserves,' Rooney said.

'As a footballer he is very intelligent and obviously he's very quick and athletic. For me he is a top top player.
