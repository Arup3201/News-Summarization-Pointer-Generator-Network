By JAN MOIR FOR THE DAILY MAIL

On the last day of London Fashion Week, a revolution of sorts took place. For the first time ever, plus-sized clothes were shown on the catwalk.

You heard me right, sister. Fashion for fat birds, being paraded as if it was something to be proud of, rather than a collection of sludge-coloured, tent-sized garments to be hidden away in a dusty corner of a department store, never to be spoken of again.

Here, there were togs for the tubs, dresses for the messes; most of them bright, floaty, lovely things that a woman of a certain size and age might actually want to buy and try. Rather than buy and cry over because there was nothing else in the shop that fitted her, except a hideous tarpaulin that once might have kept a van dry in the rain but was now masquerading as a party frock. Or perhaps that was just me?

Catwalk revolution: Looks from the Evans show in London this week proving plus size clothes can be colourful and fashionable

On the catwalk for High Street brand Evans' inaugural show, models in silver sandals and peep-toe booties showed cleverly cut bustiers with matching palazzo pants; plissé dresses in fondant colours; wafty cardigans that floated down to the floor; lots of lovely shifts with sequinned straps; a metallic, pleated skirt that fluttered like gossamer and oyster satin blouses, alongside a number of hugely flattering, all-terrain, bulge-bustin', hip-skimming skirts and dresses.

True, there were some frocky horrors, too, but the Design Collective for Evans was a clever collaboration between six high-end designers and the plus-size specialists, which will be in shops next spring. In an innovative and mutually beneficial association, the fashion teams reworked designs from their own collections into plus sizes using the Evans in-house expertise.

Successful plus size is all about sculpting and cutting, not just adding more and more fabric and hoping for the best - although tragically, that seems to have been the template for about half a century.

The new designs from Clements Ribeiro, Vita Gottlieb, Giles Deacon, Hema Kaul, Lulu Liu and Jamie Wei Huang use an enticing range of fabrics and really are fresh and covetable. Well, almost all of them. I can’t be the only blub tub who is not quite ready for a laser-cut silver pleather skirt, or a bright green evening gown or getting my belly button out, as some of the two-piece combos and slash front tops encourage.

The show was the brainchild of clothing magnate Sir Philip Green, whose Arcadia empire owns Evans along with Topshop, Dorothy Perkins and other High Street - please don't take this personally, ladies - giants.

Green staged the show at the Freemasons' Hall in Covent Garden on Tuesday evening, just as Fashion Week ground to a close for another season. Inside the hall, the fashion Press packed on to white benches to see, with their very own eyes, perhaps for the first time, what anything above a size six might look like.

As the lights dimmed, the atmosphere was similar to those Victorian freak shows, when crowds gathered, consumed with equal parts revulsion and fascination, to view bearded ladies and midgets or perhaps a combination of both.

On the front rows, there was a noticeable lack of the kind of high-velocity celebrity big names that have garlanded other fashion shows this week. No Kate Moss, no Cara or Poppy Delevingne, no Downton Abbey girls, no Alexa Chung, for no big (famewise, not shapewise) star ever wants to be associated with the taint of tub; the fashion world equivalent of the black spot.

There was not even a glimpse of Katie Hopkins, the fat-shaming, burger-munching controversialist who has put on four stone to show fatsos how simple it is to lose it again. You'd think she could have had the decency to come and heckle, or to throw chocolate biscuits at the models. Who, it must be said, didn't look much over a size 16 anyway. And in the UK, that is an average size, not a plus size.

For the more daring: Crops tops and belly button flashing outfits

Meeting demand: The Evans show was the brainchild of clothing magnate Sir Philip Green who hopes it was the first of many at London Fashion Week

Those who did turn up for this momentous moment in the calendar of chub include swimwear designer Kimberley Garner and Tamsin Outhwaite - but she'd go to the opening of a powder compact. Still, she crossed her slim ankles and tried to look interested.

The models were traditionally grim-faced and everyone sipped water in that oddly self-important way. Apart from that, we were in uncharted waters, with shapely women sporting busts, curves and even the occasional cankle on the catwalk.

Why is this deemed so unusual? Perhaps it is because fashion and fat, like a squirt of astringent lemon on to a pool of double cream, have always separated and reacted badly to each other. They are natural enemies, not allies. Since for ever, fashion has been designed exclusively for tiny, doll-girl women with rosebud breasts and chihuahua hips. 

The rest of us have just had to suffer in silence, while wearing rather too many jersey separates in various shades of Gloom and Depressed, kidding ourselves that a glimpse of chiffon shirt tail takes about a stone off and no one will notice we’re overweight if we wear noir layers and a jaunty scarf.

Star support: Tamzin Outhwaite was on the front row for the Evans show

Well, according to our new saviour Philip Green, those dark days are over. After his plus-size show, he said: 'You cannot ignore the [plus-size] market place. And you can't be defensive about it, or apologise about it. Why should the category be any different from petite?'

Why indeed? A cynic might suppose that plus fashion was never economically viable before, but now that so much of the population is so overweight, all of a sudden the numbers add up.

For decades, High Street plus fashion has been - with a few honourable exceptions - not much more than a jumble sale of shapeless cardies and endless black leggings. Fat fashion didn't have a season or a theme or a message, it was just a sea of black polyester from spring to spring, an ocean of baggy sacks and waterfall cardigans and peasant smocks that no peasant would ever willingly wear,

45 per cent of British women are size 16 or over, yet the bestselling dress size is a 12, followed by a 14 

Nice clothes and pretty things? They were for the thin girls. The looks we had to choose between were limited and brutal, including Town Hall In Tights, Leopard Print Barrage Balloon, Hattie Jacques Special, Godzilla Secretary, Mad Granny, and my personal standby, The Black Cube.

Yet when I visited the Evans flagship store in London's Oxford Street this week, it was clear that change was in the air. Yes, there are still yards of black leggings and all-weather wraps, but Evans has quietly rebranded itself as 'shape specialists' who 'embrace the curve' in a shop that sells 'reworked designs for fuller-figured ladies.'

Items given pride of place include dresses from designers such as Scarlett & Jo and Lovedrobe, with prices ranging from around £30 to £70. There are also cheery assistants who are knowledgeable, helpful and encouraging. They know that if anyone is going to have a plus-size breakdown in the changing room it is going to be us.

A wonderful lady called Daisy encouraged me to try a pansy print frock that I would have run a mile from, but which actually looked very... nice.

Back at the show, Green suggested that Evans, which has more than 180 stores in the UK and Ireland, may even have a catwalk show every season. 'This is day one,' he said.

So is it just a gimmick or genuine change? Eyeing up a lovely Vita Gottlieb purple dress on the catwalk, the one with the scarlet ribbons and divine neckline, I do hope, hope, hope it is the former.
