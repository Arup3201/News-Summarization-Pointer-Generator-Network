Dead bodies, diseased lungs and a man on a ventilator were among the 
graphic images for revamped tobacco labels unveiled today by U.S. 
health officials.

In the most significant change to 
U.S. cigarette packs in 25 years, the nine new labels - which include phrases like 'Smoking can 
kill you' and 'Cigarettes cause cancer'  - must be on cigarette packages and in advertisements 
starting in October 2012.

Proposed in November under a law that put the multibillion-dollar 
tobacco industry under the control of the Food and Drug Administration, the labels send a clear message to consumers about the dangers of tobacco - responsible for about 443,000 
U.S. deaths a year.

New cigarette packs feature graphic images, such as rotting and diseased teeth and gums and a man with a tracheotomy smoking. Also included among the labels are and a mother holding her baby 
with smoke swirling around them.

Each label includes a national quit smoking hotline number.

The labels will take up the top half of a pack of cigarette packs. Warning labels also must appear in advertisements and constitute 20 per cent of an ad. Cigarette makers have until autumn 2012 to comply.

Mandates to introduce new graphic warning labels were part of a law passed in 2009 that, for the first time, gave the federal government authority to regulate tobacco, including setting guidelines for marketing and labelling, banning certain products and limiting nicotine.

The announcement follows reviews of 
scientific literature, public comments and results from an 
FDA-contracted study of 36 labels proposed last November.

In recent years, more than 30 countries or jurisdictions have introduced labels similar to those being introduced by the FDA. The U.S. first mandated the use of warning labels stating 'Cigarettes may be hazardous to your health' in 1965. Current warning labels - a small box with black and white text - were put on cigarette packs in the mid-1980s.

The FDA says the new labels will 'clearly and effectively convey the health risks of smoking' aimed at encouraging current smokers to quit and discourage non-smokers and youth from starting to use cigarettes.

American Cancer Society CEO John R Seffrin applauded the new labels in a statement, saying they have the potential to 'encourage adults to give up their deadly addiction to cigarettes and deter children from starting in the first place'.

The new labels come as the share of 
Americans who smoke has fallen dramatically since 1970, from nearly 40 
percent to about 20 percent. The rate has stalled since about 2004. 
About 46 million adults in the U.S. smoke cigarettes.

It's unclear why declines in smoking have stalled. Some experts have cited tobacco company discount coupons on cigarettes or lack of funding for programs to discourage smoking or to help smokers quit.

While it is impossible to say how many people quit because of the labels, various studies suggest the labels do spur people to quit. The new labels offer the opportunity for a pack-a-day smoker to see graphic warnings on the dangers of cigarettes more than 7,000 times per year.

The FDA estimates the new labels will
reduce the number of smokers by 213,000 in 2013, with smaller 
additional reductions through 2031.

The World Health Organization said in
a survey done in countries with graphic warning labels that a majority 
of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 per cent said the 
warnings led them to consider quitting.

While some have voiced concerns over the hard-hitting nature of some of the labels, those concerns should be trumped by the government's responsibility to warn people about the dangers of smoking, said David Hammond, a health behaviour researcher at the University of Waterloo in Canada, who worked with the firm designing the labels for the FDA.

'This isn't about doing what's 
pleasant for people. It's about fulfilling the government's mandate if 
they're going to allow these things to be sold,' Hammond said. 'What's 
bothering people is the risk associated with their behaviour, not the 
warnings themselves.'

In places like Canada, Hammond said 
smokers offended by some of the images on cigarettes packs there started
asking for different packs when they received ones with certain gory 
images, or used a case to cover them up. But smokers said those warnings
still had an effect on them.

Bad for branding: Tobacco makers have argued the warnings would relegate the companies' brands to the bottom half of the cigarette packaging, making them 'difficult, if not impossible, to see'

Canada introduced similar warning 
labels in 2000. Since then, its smoking rates have declined from about 
26 per cent to about 20 per cent. How much the warnings contributed to 
the decline is unclear because the country also implemented other 
tobacco control efforts.

The legality of the new labels also is part of a pending federal lawsuit filed by Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Reynolds American Inc, parent company of America's second-largest cigarette maker, RJ Reynolds; number three cigarette maker, Greensboro, North Carolina-based Lorillard Inc; and others.

Tobacco makers in the lawsuit have argued the warnings would relegate the companies' brands to the bottom half of the cigarette packaging, making them 'difficult, if not impossible, to see.'

A spokesman for Richmond, Virginia-based Altria Group Inc, parent company of the nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, said the company was looking at the final labels but would not comment further.
