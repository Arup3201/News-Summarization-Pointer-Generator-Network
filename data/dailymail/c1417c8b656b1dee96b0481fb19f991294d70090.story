One Manchester club has spent a shed load of money trying to keep up with their local rivals - and it is strange to think that it is United splashing the cash.

Last season they finished 22 points adrift of Premier League champions Manchester City and Louis van Gaal was brought in (and given a healthy amount to spend) to ensure this did not happen again.

Very noisy neighbours City are just as able to have another delve into the market place, of course, and turn the new order into a familiar one.

Manchester United can close the gap on City to five points by beating Southampton on Monday night. Van Gaal's team are on a good run of form with four straight wins and just one defeat in nine matches.

Perhaps 'just' is not the right word. Losing 1-0 to their inter-city rivals will rankle more than any other loss to most fans.

Yet the fact of the matter is that United are continuing to play catch-up with City, who in turn are hanging on to the coat tails of Chelsea.

The unthinkable could happen. United may well finish below City for a second successive season and that has not happened since Boney M topped the charts with Rivers of Babylon. In other words, May 1978.

United have been the undisputed kings of Manchester pretty much ever since. Even when City won the Premier League in 2012, it went to the wire with only goal difference separating the clubs.

That all changed with the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson. Since the wily Scot called it a day in May 2013, United have spent £215m on new players.

David Moyes has come and gone and, in his place, Dutchman van Gaal is beginning to make his mark at Old Trafford.

Last summer saw the arrival of the likes of Angel di Maria (£60m), Luke Shaw (£27m), Marcos Rojo (£16m), Ander Herrera (£29m) and Daley Blind (£13.8m). Radamel Falcao was signed on a £6m loan.

Quality players all, even though not all of them have hit the heights on a regular basis yet. Di Maria is now injured, as well, which makes it even harder for United to make in-roads on their close rivals.

Van Gaal is still dissatisfied and could step up the hunt for a world-class central defender, whether in January or in summer.

Striker Falcao is not regarded as fit enough to spearhead United's attack for 90 minutes, which means an over-reliance on Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney so that may also be a position which needs further strengthening. 

Look at the Premier League goals tally, and that says everything. Rooney has five, Juan Mata and RVP have scored four while Di Maria has chipped in with three – and we are in December.

United's best hope may be that Manuel Pellegrini is set to be without Sergio Aguero for the busy Christmas period. The Argentine's dodgy knee could be a blessing down the road.

Each time United added to their squad, the danger is that City can also recruit big. They were almost modest in their spending last summer, although Frenchman Eliaquim Mangala did cost £32m from Porto. 

The young defender was one of the hottest properties in Europe last season and once upon a time might have been the sort of player United could have tempted without a problem. Sadly for Van Gaal, he cannot even offer Champions League football as an incentive.

When Ferguson retired, the general consensus was that the squad required an overhaul simply to stay in the same place. 

Treading water is no good, however, when all around are swimming furiously. Chelsea have set the benchmark this season, followed closely by City.

United find themselves in a chasing pack which includes the likes of West Ham and Southampton. Last year they were so far behind City that there were no exhaust fumes to choke on.

The position has improved this year. United are making a fight of it, at least, despite a huge injury list which has decimated them of defenders and meant the likes of Ashley Young playing in defence.

Van Gaal is not a fan of the festive fixture jam but, maybe, he should look at it another way. There are a lot of matches for Aguero to miss!
