The widow of Chris Kyle, the former Navy SEAL depicted in the Oscar-nominated movie American Sniper, will be among the first witnesses to testify during the trial of his alleged killer in Texas.

Opening statements are expected Wednesday in the trial of Eddie Ray Routh. The former Marine is accused of fatally shooting Kyle and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield, as the pair tried to help Routh at a shooting range.

Erath County District Attorney Alan Nash said Tuesday that the prosecution's first two witnesses will be Taya Kyle and Littlefield's mother, Judy.

Possible outcome: Prosecutors won't seek the death penalty, but Routh faces life in prison without parole if convicted

The judge ruled that both women can stay in court to watch proceedings after testifying. The judge also said he would allow prosecutors to take photos of Routh's tattoos.

All eyes were on Routh Tuesday as he entered the courtroom in Erath County for a pretrial proceeding looking markedly different from his 2013 booking photo. 

Instead of a mop of shaggy hair and patchy beard covering his gaunt face, Routh appeared clean-shaven, sporting with close-cropped hair and a pair of dark-rimmed glasses.

With his bulkier frame filling out his black suit and pressed light-blue button-down shirt, the 27-year-old murder suspect looked nearly unrecognizable when compared to his arrest photos taken in February 2013. 

Routh, a former Marine, is charged with capital murder in the deaths of 38-year-old Chris Kyle and Kyle's friend, 35-year-old Chad Littlefield. Kyle and Littlefield were trying to help Routh when prosecutors say he shot them at a Texas gun range in 2013.

The Oscar-nominated  movie America Sniper based on Kyle's memoir as a celebrated sharpshooter who served four tours in Iraq has grossed nearly $300million.

Routh's attorneys plan to pursue an insanity defense. Prosecutors won't seek the death penalty. He faces life in prison without parole if convicted.

Family members have said Routh, 27, struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder after leaving the Marines in 2010. The small arms technician served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti. Kyle took Routh to the shooting range after Routh's mother asked if he could help her son.

Kyle made more than 300 kills as a sniper for SEAL Team 3, according to his own count and earned two Silver Stars for valor. After leaving the military, Kyle volunteered with veterans facing mental health problems, often taking them shooting.

About two hours after Kyle, Littlefield and Routh arrived at the upscale Rough Creek Lodge and Resort on Feb. 2, 2013, an employee discovered the bodies of Kyle and Littlefield at the remote range.

Authorities say Routh drove to his sister's house in Kyle's truck, telling her and her husband that he had killed Kyle and Littlefield.

His sister told police that Routh 'was out of his mind, saying people were sucking his soul and that he could smell the pigs.'
