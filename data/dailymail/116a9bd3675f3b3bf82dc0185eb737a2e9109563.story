When the ladies of The Only Way Is Essex burst onto our screens they put glamour on the map and made false eyelashes, fake tan and glitzy dresses their own.

And now, their looks are so admired that fans of the show have come up with a list of their assets that what would make the perfect TOWIE girl.

A mixture of Billie's bust, Chloe's  hair, Lauren Pope's waist and Lucy Mecklenburgh's overall look seems to be what most women would love to have.

A new survey asked females which body parts of the stars they admire and desire the most.

The ideal TOWIE woman would have the personality of Gemma Collins, the overall look of Lucy Meck, the bust of Billie Faiers and the waist of Lauren Pope

The majority of those polled, 56 per 
cent, would love to copy Lucy Mecklenburgh's look saying her sense of 
style and body shape were enough to turn them green with envy.

Pregnant Billie
 Faiers' boobs were a must for 31 per cent of women who believed they 
give her a shapely figure, while a third loved Lauren Popeâ€™s tiny 
waistline.

Her best friend, Chloe Sims, came out on top as the TOWIE celeb whose hair most women would love to be graced with.

Curvy Gemma Collins has got the personality it seems: 'bubbly and fun but tough when she needs to be' that women adored.

Most coveted: Over half of women in a new survey revealed they would most like to look like Lucy Mecklenburgh

Billie's sister Sam was notably absent from the perfect TOWIE girl mash-up.

When it came to the men of Essex, women loved Dan Osbourne's physique and adored Tom Pearce's eyes.

The impeccable sense of style of Charlie Sims would be a must on their perfect man, combined with Mario Falcone's chiseled jaw and Joey Essex's abs.

And the perfect personality from the TOWIE men? James 'Arg' Argent won hands down with the majority of women questioned loving his cheeky ways.

Bringing the fun to TOWIE: Gemma Collins and James Argent were voted as having the best personalities on the show

One woman who took part in the survey said: 'I admire the amount of effort the cast of TOWIE take in looking good. Lucy Mecklenburgh is my idol and I look to her for inspiration when it comes to things like weight loss. It is definitely easier to reach your goal of looking good when you have someone so gorgeous to aspire to.'

Another added: 'The TOWIE girls always look amazing. If I looked half as good as them I'd be one happy lady. I like different bits of each of them.

'I love Chloe's hair - it always looks so luscious and healthy and I adore Gemma's personality. She so funny and always stands up for herself when she needs to.'

Speaking about the men of TOWIE, one 
respondent said: 'They are are a sight to behold. They are amazingly 
well groomed, always wear the most stylish clothes, and are generally 
pretty gorgeous. If only my other half made as much effort.'

A
 spokesperson for Promotionalcodes.org.uk, who conducted the survey, 
said: 'It's interesting to see which aspects of TV stars people aspire 
to, however we were not surprised to see Joey Essex up there for his 
body rather than his brains.

'There are some great looking stars on TOWIE and it does no harm at all to aspire to little bits of them.'
