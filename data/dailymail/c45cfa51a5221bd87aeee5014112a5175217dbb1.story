Loom bands have already taken the celebrity world by storm, and now the bracelets made popular by the likes of David Beckham and the Duchess of Cambridge are the subject of a record attempt.

Pupils at St Joseph’s and St Teresa’s School in Wells, Somerset have created an incredible 650 foot long chain containing 60,000 loom bands.

Now they are hoping to break the world record the longest loom band chain - although they still have some way to go to beat the 29,040 foot chain created in California earlier this year.

Pupils at St Joseph’s and St Teresa’s came up with the challenge after they - like so many other schoolchildren around the country - became obsessed with the craze.

It sees youngsters link dozens of tiny, brightly coloured rubber bands together to create a bracelet.

Although loom bands were invented by an American engineer in 2011, they really took off when a number of celebrities were spotted wearing the bracelets earlier this year.

Now the St Joseph’s and St Teresa’s pupils are taking the craze to its logical, record-breaking conclusion.

'It started off with a girl in my class,
 she started coming in with bands, then we said we came up with the idea
 we should try and break the world record attempt,' said 10-year-old John Doyle.

'Then everyone in school joined in. I think there are 300 bands in a metre so it’s a lot of bands, but everyone is doing it,' he added.

'It is a lot of money, it’s cost me about £7 so far, I save up my pocket money and use that to buy them,' John went on to say.

The Duchess of Cambridge is just one celebrity known to sport a loom band.

She was spotted wearing a multi-colour bracelet - given to her as a gift by a little girl - during a royal tour of New Zealand earlier this year.

A few months after the Duchess was seen wearing the band, her parents Carole and Michael Middleton began selling a similar product through their mail-order company Party Pieces.

Sales of loom bands have since rocketed by more than 300 per cent and they're now as much a fashion statement as they are a children's fad.

Other well-known figures seen wearing them include former footballer David Beckham and One Direction's Harry Styles.

Although loom bands have won the  celebrity seal of approval, school children are the real driving force behind the brightly-coloured bracelets' popularity.

Ask anyone with children and they'll likely confirm Britain has gone loom band crazy in the months since the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one.

John's eight-year-old friend Summer Ansell said she has been making loom bands for the last three months and still really enjoys making the bracelets. 

'One day we will get the record. It will take a long while though,' she said.

'I enjoy making them, if you try as hard as you can you will achieve whatever you want to achieve,' she added.

Summer said she had heard older people at her school were attempting to break the world record, so asked if she could join in too.

'All my friends have joined in. They don’t mind at all - girls and boys. But girls are much better at making them,' she said.

Headteacher
 Angela Nolan said she first noticed the children making the bracelets 
two months ago - with the pastime quickly taking over the school.

But
 it was not until a few weeks later when she was walking through the 
playground that she saw the pupils coming together to link the bands 
into one giant creation.

'One morning I went out on the playground and I noticed they had started to put together longer chains,' she said.

'I
 asked them what they were trying to do and they said they wanted to 
break the world record for the longest chain. This was all at 8.45 in 
the morning,' she added.

Some way to go: Although there is not yet an official Guinness World Record, 500 people in Tustin, California built a 29,040 foot chain to raise money for a cancer sufferer in March this year

Ms Nolan said she was 'really surprised and really pleased' that the pupils were working together and had themselves such a lofty goal.

'They really believe that they absolutely can achieve anything they want,' she said.

The children have a long way to go before setting a record, however.

Although there is not yet an official Guinness World Record, 500 people in Tustin, California built a 29,040ft chain in March this year.

Their creation was part of fundraising attempt to raise money for a seven-year-old who was battling brain cancer.
