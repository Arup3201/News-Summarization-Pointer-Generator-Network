They are an ancient tribal group  famed for creating beautifully ornate gold objects and then hiding rich hoards in times of enemy invasions and unrest.

And it seems the Thracians, who were bordered by the Ancient Greeks to the south, were particularly skilled at making jewellery.

Archaeologists have uncovered a haul of ancient artefacts ranging from gold earrings, delicate beads and ornaments to pottery at the Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari in Bulgaria.

Dating back to the third century BC the well preserved tomb was discovered in 1982 and reveals that the culture was inspired by Hellenistic Greece, the period between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and 146 BC.

According to archaeologist Diana Gergova the relics date back to around the end of the fourth or beginning of the third century BC. 

The antiquity of Thrace dates back to ancient Greek legends and the first historical record of the group is found in the Iliad where they are described as allies of the Trojans in the Trojan War.

They inhabited a large area in Southeastern Europe with the Bosphorus Strait, the Balkan Mountains, and the Rhodope Mountains as geographical boundaries.

Modern-day Thrace consists of the southeastern regions of Bulgaria, northwestern Greece, and the parts of Turkey that separate the Black Sea from the Sea of Marmara.
