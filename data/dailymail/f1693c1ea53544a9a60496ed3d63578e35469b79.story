The BBC has decided to move Rod McKenzie the long-serving editor of Newsbeat, its youth news service, after complaints he bullied staff

The BBC has decided to move the long-serving  editor of Newsbeat, its youth news service, after complaints he bullied staff.

The allegations involving Rod McKenzie stretch over two decades. He is accused of having favourites in his team and to have ‘frozen out’ those he did not like. It is also claimed that he shouted at some employees in front of other staff.

Mr McKenzie has denied the claims during a BBC disciplinary procedure that has lasted for almost a year. Sources close to him believe he has been the victim of a social media campaign.

According to sources within the BBC, the number of bullying complaints made against Mr McKenzie, who is likely to be on a salary of more than £100,000 a year, are in the double digits but less than 30.

Mr McKenzie, who was editor of 1Xtra News as well Radio 1’s award-winning Newsbeat service, has not been sacked, but he is expected to be given another post outside the news division of the corporation.

It is understood that Mr McKenzie has been given a final written warning and is taking one month’s leave.

The allegations surrounding Mr McKenzie come days after it emerged that eight BBC staff were disciplined for bullying or sexual harassment in the first nine months of last year but only one was dismissed.

‘It’s not the case that there is no room for bullies at the BBC,’ said one source. ‘There are just different places for them.’

The
 complaints against Mr McKenzie formed part of a review last year led by
 Dinah Rose QC into allegations of bullying and other forms of 
harassment at the BBC. The corporation is under pressure to address 
internal  bullying after her review received submissions from 930 
people.

A source close to Mr McKenzie said: ‘He strongly rejects 
these claims and maintains that  his behaviour is entirely in keeping 
with a pressurised news environment.’

He is said to be pleased that 
some of the ‘most lurid’ claims about him were not upheld. He is 
believed to have disputed that he had favourites, arguing that ‘a 
favourite is a high achiever by another name’.

The BBC’s disciplinary
 process did not uphold claims against Mr McKenzie that he brought 
prejudices to the process of deciding which members of staff lost their 
positions as part of the BBC’s Delivering Quality First efficiency 
savings process.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘We do not discuss internal staff
 or disciplinary issues.’
