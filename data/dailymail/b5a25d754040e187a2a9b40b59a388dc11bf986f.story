Charles Bronson claims he is now a peace-loving artist and has changed his last name to Salvador, after the famous surrealist artist

He is one of Britain's most notorious and violent prisoners, spending the last 40 years locked in solitary confinement. 

During that time Charles Bronson has still managed to attack 20 prison officers, take 11 hostages, and during one standoff demanded a helicopter, a blow up doll and a cup of tea.

But it seems the 61-year-old has now reinvented himself as an artist named Salvador, and says he wants live out his remaining days in prison peacefully while focusing on his painting.

Born as Michael Gordon Peterson, Bronson changed his name in 1987 after a bare-knuckle boxing promoter advised that it would be good for his career. 

But in a recent note, penned from the inside of Full Sutton prison in York, Bronson announced he is changing his name to Charles Salvador, after the famous surrealist painter.

In the rambling letter, riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, he declares: 'Bronson come alive in 1987, he died in 2014.'

He adds: 'It's now Salvador all the way to Disneyland, your welcome to join the ride but its non-violent all the way.'

He also revealed his new motto, amor vincit omnia - Latin for 'love conquers all' - before declaring 'you work it out for yourselfs, like I had too.'

The letter finishes: 'Years from now you'll all forget about Bronson, I've already forgotten. I'd sooner pull my teeth out than go through that hell again.

'Welcome to my new dimension, is there any ladies want their a**** painting? Cost you though, I don't come cheap! Oh well, time to fly, I can feel an art coming on.'

Now he says his greatest wish is to be released from prison before his mother Eria, 84, dies.

In a rambling letter, the life-term prisoner says Bronson 'died in 2014' and announces 'it's Salvador all the way to Disneyland...but its's non-violent all the way'

Bronson declares his motto is amor vincit omnia - Latin for 'love conquers all' - before asking 'is there any ladies want their a**** painted?'

Speaking to The Sun, via his campaign secretary Lorraine Etherington, he said: 'It would mean so much to her to be with me again as a free man.

'I am a changed man. I have started my journey as a brand new character, a very happy soul, a born-again artist.

'All I want is the chance to express myself as the artist and man of peace I now am.'

Bronson was initially jailed in for seven years in 1974, then aged 22, for armed robbery, but quickly had his sentence increased by nine months after he attacked another prisoner with a glass jug.

A rooftop protest at Walton Gaol in 1985 earned him another year inside, during which time he also tried to strangle the governor of Wormwood Scrubs.

Bronson took up art in the mid-1990s while locked away  in the infamous 'Hannibal cell' at Wakefield prison

His art, much of which is posted online, includes self-portraits and surreal drawings about life in prison

He was released in 1987 and spent a total of 68 days outside prison, before being arrested for robbery. He was released again in 1992, but this time only managed 53 days outside before again being arrested for robbery and possession of a firearm.

Over the course of the next five years, he took a prison librarian hostage, before repeating the stunt with three inmates at Belmarsh prison - forcing them to call him 'General' and threatening to eat one unless his demands were met.

He was handed an indefinite life sentence in 1999 for kidnapping prison teacher Phil Danielson at Hull jail, and most recently attacked Alan Parkins, governor of Woodhill Prison, in February this year.

While Bronson is commonly known as Britain's most dangerous prisoner, campaigner for his release have long tried to argue that he only poses a danger to the prison system.

Miss Etherington, secretary of the Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund, handed a 10,000-signature petition to Downing Street last year asking for his release, saying he is 'no threat to the public.'

Bronson was initially jailed in 1974 for armed robbery, but is now serving an indefinite life sentence after repeatedly attacking prison guards, taking inmates hostage and staging protests

He says he is a changed man and hopes to be released before his mother Eira, 84, passes away
