A mother and her six-year-old son were brutally stabbed to death in a horrific double murder at their seaside home.

The alarm was raised yesterday morning after a concerned family member apparently alerted police.

Officers rushed round to the semi-detached dormer bungalow on a quiet suburban street and broke into the property.

Murder probe: Police stand guard outside the house in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire, where a woman and child were found dead yesterday

The little boy was found knifed to death in his upstairs bedroom while his 41-year-old mother was lying dead downstairs.

Police sources said the house was a scene of carnage with both victims suffering a sustained and frenzied knife attack.

It is understood the woman and her son were found lying in pools of their own blood and had been repeatedly stabbed.

A 34-year-old man, believed to be the father of the child and the woman’s partner, was found with serious knife wounds.

Probe: A police forensics officer outside the property yesterday as a double murder investigation got underway

He was arrested on suspicion of murder
and was airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital where his condition is 
described as serious.

Police said they were confronted with a
‘distressing scene’ as they entered the property, where the body of the
child was found in the front bedroom.

Detective Superintendent Paul Withers 
said: ‘This is a murder inquiry, but we are not looking for anybody else
in connection with the investigation.

‘It was a very distressing scene. The 
deceased people have been attacked with a knife. I can only imagine the 
stress the family is going through.’ Police discovered the gruesome 
scene at 11.40am yesterday morning in Bolton-le-Sands, near Carnforth, 
Lancashire.

The house is believed to have been rented by a couple who moved in with their son only three weeks ago.

It is understood they were refurbishing the property and carrying out other maintenance in recent days.

Neighbours reported seeing the downstairs lights on in the dormer bungalow into the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Police said yesterday that they 
believed the killings had happened ‘within the last 24 hours’ and post 
mortems were being carried out last night.

The suspect is being treated for knife
wounds and was said to be in a ‘serious condition’ with detectives 
monitoring his situation.

Neighbours said they were stunned and shocked that a brutal double murder could occur in a sleepy residential street.

Peter Hammersley, 46, a Tesco night 
manager, said: ‘You don’t think anything like this could happen in 
Bolton-le-Sands – anywhere but here. It is such a nice quiet place to 
live.

‘You just never know what kind of 
stress people are living under. It is such a shame for the family and 
everybody around here is in shock.’

Another neighbour, who didn’t want to
be named, said: ‘I’m horrified by what’s happened. Whatever went on, 
no-one deserves to be killed. What on earth did that little six-year-old
boy do to deserve that?’

Another local resident said: ‘I think
they had only just moved in to the house in the past couple of weeks. 
The only thing I noticed which was odd, was that when I got up in the 
middle of the night, their downstairs lights were always on, even at 
4am.’

Yesterday, the curtains of the little 
boy’s upstairs bedroom were drawn, with just a little England football 
mini-kit visible on the window.

The downstairs curtains were also drawn as forensic teams and detectives searched the property.

A white Peugeot van, believed to belong to the 34-year-old man, was parked outside the address.
