Chris Denning, 73, is to be prosecuted over 41 offences including indecent assault and another serious sexual offence between 1967 and 1985

A disc jockey who was part of the original Radio 1 line-up was yesterday charged with a string of sex attacks on 22 boys aged between nine and 16.

Chris Denning, 73, is to be prosecuted over 41 offences including indecent assault and another serious sexual offence between 1967 and 1985.

Although not a household name, Denning posed for a picture with a host of famous BBC DJs for the launch of Radio 1 and Radio 2 in 1967.

Among those alongside him were Tony Blackburn, Jimmy Young, Kenny Everett, Terry Wogan, Pete Murray, Ed Stewart, Pete Drummond and John Peel.

Denning was arrested last June as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation into child sexual abuse allegations, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

He is the fifth person to be prosecuted as part of the operation.

Baljit Ubhey, chief crown prosecutor for London, said: ‘We have carefully considered the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in relation to Christopher Denning.

‘Having completed our review, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest for Mr Denning to be charged with 41 offences, including 34 counts of indecent assault.

These date from between 1967 and 1985, and relate to 22 male complainants aged between nine and 16 at the time of the alleged offending.

‘The decision to prosecute has been taken in accordance with the code for crown prosecutors and Crown Prosecution Service legal guidance on rape and child sexual abuse.’

Denning will appear before Westminster Magistrates’ Court in Central London today.

The prosecutor added: ‘We have also decided that no further action should be taken in relation to three further allegations against Mr Denning, made by three further complainants, as we determined that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.’

She did not reveal details of where the alleged attacks happened and the circumstances in which Denning allegedly met his accusers.

The earliest allegations he faces concern two offences of indecent assault on a boy aged 12-14 between 1967 and 1970.

The two most recent allegations relate to two offences of indecent assault on a boy aged 16 between 1984 and 1985.

Denning was the first announcer heard on BBC2 when the TV channel took to the air in 1964.

He worked for Radio Luxembourg and Radio London before presenting Where It’s At with Kenny Everett on the BBC’s Light Programme.

He then became one of the original DJs on BBC Radio 1, where he continued presenting Where It’s At, had his own weekly show and deputised for Tony Blackburn when he was absent from his breakfast show.

Denning left Radio 1 in 1969 and worked for the record label Decca for two years.

He is said to have worked as a music producer for The Beatles and to have helped launch the Bay City Rollers and Gary Glitter.

He also ran his own music and video production business, and later moved overseas.

When arrested last year, the former DJ was staying at a hostel for the homeless in East London.
