A retired public school teacher drowned after his yacht capsized while he was on a sailing trip with friends.

Douglas Perrin, 66, died after the yacht ran into strong winds off the coast of Ireland.

His two friends, a retired couple, survived by swimming through stormy seas and climbing a cliff on a small uninhabited island where they spent the night.

Two passengers survived by swimming 300 yards to a small uninhabited island where they spent the night (pictured, the upturned hull of Mr Perrin's boat)

The survivors climbed a 40ft cliff on to uninhabited Castle Island where they spent the night before being found

They are now being treated for hypothermia.

The
 body of Mr Perrin, who was wearing a life jacket, was found yesterday 
morning in Roaring Water Bay shortly after his two friends were found.

Mr Perrin moved to picturesque Dunmanus Bay in County Cork three years ago after retiring as a teacher in Oxfordshire.

His
 wife Judith, 60, was at their coastal home when the drama unfolded on 
Wednesday evening. She contacted the emergency services after her 
husband and his friends failed to arrive for a dinner reservation.

The
 two friends – a man, 75, and woman, 66, understood to be husband and 
wife – were on holiday from England. After clinging to the upturned hull
 of the boat, they managed to swim around 300 yards in stormy waters 
before climbing a 40ft cliff to reach safety on Castle Island.

Their
 cries for help were heard by coastguards yesterday morning and they 
were airlifted to hospital. They said that Mr Perrin had drifted away 
from them as they battled to reach the island.

The man's body was found near Sherkin Island. The couple he was sailing with were rescued across the bay near Castle Island, near where their yacht was found capsized between Carthy's Island and Castle Island

A
 search and rescue source said: ‘One of the crew on board thought they 
heard somebody shouting so they stopped the boat to listen and they 
heard two people on the cliff on Castle Island.

‘The
 rescue boat then made its way to the shore and dropped off two crew 
members who then went to the casualties who were fairly shaken up and 
very cold. They were in their 60s and 70s, they had climbed a big cliff 
and had spent a night in the cold.’

Lifeboat
 spokesman Denis Quinlan said at first they had dismissed the sound of 
shouting for help as seagulls. The party had set off from the village of
 Schull and had been planning to take a two-hour trip around the bay 
before dinner.

Since 
retiring to Ireland, Mr  Perrin had become active in the local 
community, was a member of a ramblers’ association and had been 
appointed an honorary  secretary of Holy Trinity Church.

The three sailors were in a Drascombe Lugger, similar to the one pictured, on a trip around the bay when it ran into trouble last night. Friends of the sailors sounded the alarm at around 7pm when they failed to return

Church secretary Maud Swanton said yesterday: ‘He was a very nice man and very helpful.

‘The wife of the deceased told me they were due to meet at 7pm for dinner. When they didn’t turn up she got concerned.

‘She
 was quite confident when I spoke to her that they were all competent 
sailors, that they knew what they were doing and it wasn’t their first 
time out. These things can happen to the best of sailors.’

Mr
 Perrin taught government and politics at Bloxham School, a 
£30,000-a-year boarding school in Banbury, Oxfordshire before his 
retirement. Both he and his wife, who taught English at Headington 
private girls’ school in Oxford, did voluntary charity work as teachers 
in Zanzibar.

An air and sea 
search, co-ordinated by the Irish Coast Guard began when the group 
failed to make it to port as planned. The yacht was found upturned about
 one-and-a-half miles from shore near Castle Island.
