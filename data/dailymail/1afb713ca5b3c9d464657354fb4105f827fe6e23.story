Cayman Naib, 13, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound with a gun taken from his family's Pennsylvania home, the Delaware County medical examiner's office declared on Monday 

Grief counselors were sent to Bryn Mawr school on Monday and classmates remembered him as a ‘thoughtful, bright, fun-loving’ student at a candlelight vigil, hours after his body was found.

‘Cayman was such an admirable and interesting young man and our bonds and enjoyment to each other were continuously deepening as he was becoming a man,’ wrote his parents Farid Naib and Becky Malcolm-Naib on a Facebook page entitled 'Celebrating Cayman'.

'We are planning a memorial service on Saturday with details to follow. There is no getting away from the sad facts surrounding Cayman's death, but we want the memorial to be uplifting and celebrate his life.

'Our grief has been unbearable. It is only through the support of our many, many close friends and family that we can navigate these dark days.'

The Facebook page - previously been called 'Find Cayman' - had been created to aid the search effort.

The family had updated the page on Sunday afternoon with a message confirming Cayman's death.  

Cayman had left his home 30 minutes after getting an email from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr about late homework

A police source said a K-9 team found Cayman Naib's body in Darby Creek on Sunday at 1.30pm

They wrote: 'It is with a heavy heart that we share news that the family has just learned through the search and rescue team and local law enforcement that Cayman has been found deceased. 

'Please understand that the family is still processing and struggling with this most recent news but that they would like to thank all of the thousands of people over the last five days – friends, family, community, law enforcement, local, county, and federal, search and rescue, fire departments, the school communities, especially Shipley and Episcopal Academy, and even perfect strangers – who have come together to support the family to find Cayman.'

The family has asked for privacy and will not update the Facebook page while the investigation is ongoing.

They have a daughter as well.  

Police were investigating the matter as a runaway case, according to FOX 29. 

Before getting the heartbreaking news, Farid Naib, Cayman's father, called his son 'a great kid'.

He said: 'He was upset over a homework assignment and went out into the storm Wednesday night.'
