This extraordinary artwork gives a whole new meaning to the phrase 'my body is a temple'.

Body paint artist Trina Merry spent around nine hours painstakingly painting the 17 naked models and forming them into a living, breathing temple.

The work was released by Trina to promote her partnership with charity Beyond the Four Walls - an organisation that works with young women in Nepal to help improve their lives.

'Body art is the most traditional art form - it's the most ancient art form known to man and pre-dates even cave paintings,' the 34-year-old said. 'I enjoy the human-to-human intimate connection.'

Start of a big project: Models practice their positions before being painted

It took the models nine hours in total to be painted

Trina began making body art in 2006 and 
took it up full time in 2011 - her temple structure was displayed at 
WORKS gallery in San Jose, America in March.

Despite being posed up for only 20 minutes, some of the models found being a naked human canvass a little intimidating.

'Some people are uncomfortable when they are first nude in front of others,' added Trina.

'I try to be gentle and talk through things with each person and work with their levels of comfort so they feel safe.

'But when you're in a room full of 16 other nude people you get over your fears pretty quickly.

'It becomes more normal to be the nude person than the one with their clothes still on, so peer pressure works in my favor in those instances.'

The New Yorker is hoping the series of striking images will raise awareness for Beyond the Four Walls after she dedicated the work to them.

She added: 'We are excited to partner with them and bring awareness to these talented and beautiful women.

'Their work is signified by the central gold woman in the image - she represents the healed and loved women in Nepal.

'It is one of the only countries in the world where women have a shorter life expectancy then men.

'Many young girls are either sold into slavery to pay off family debts or married off as young as age eight.

'Women are responsible for all the hard labor and domestic duties of the house - 75% of women do not read or write.

'Beyond the Four Walls has created a solution to create internet cafes that the girls can run, bringing money to their families and simultaneously allowing them a chance to get an education online and use the internet as a tool for jobs or to launch entrepreneurial ventures.'
