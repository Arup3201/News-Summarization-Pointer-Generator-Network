Jose Mourinho won for the first time at Villa Park after five previous visits without a victory, while the home side ended the fourth-longest goal drought in Premier League history. But it seems some things never change.

The Mourinho camp was accused of being verbally abusive by Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert following a bad tempered exchange between the two dugouts in the first half of this thrusting encounter. Lambert threw his overcoat to the ground after someone on the opposite bench made a remark towards him midway through the half.

‘It was something said but not by Jose,’ said Lambert. ‘He is a great manager, it is fantastic what the guy has done, I would love to learn from him as football manager but I wouldn’t like to learn things off the pitch from somebody in his dugout. I don’t know what was said - I don’t speak Portuguese, maybe he doesn’t speak Glaswegian.’

Lambert also accused Mourinho of trying to ‘put pressure’ on him by calling the Villa squad, who are without a win at home in the league since early December, one of the best in the top tier. ‘I analyse teams by the quality of players and Villa have one of the best squads, very good players and a very good bench, lots of solutions.’ He even praised the home fans.

‘Maybe he is trying to put pressure on me, I don’t know,’ swiped Lambert, who also noted Mourinho was already ‘halfway down the pitch’ when he went to shake his hand at the end of the game.

Some animosity perhaps remains between the pair after Lambert refused to shake Mourinho’s hand when he attempted to leave the pitch before the final whistle when the sides met at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season, a game won 3-0 by Chelsea.

After a frosty encounter with journalists earlier in the week, Mourinho was notably subdued throughout the match, rarely straying from the dugout, except to celebrate Eden Hazard’s opening goal and Branislav Ivanovic’s superb winner. But at the final whistle, the Portuguese marched towards the travelling supporters in the Doug Ellis Stand and asked them for more applause. On the day main rivals Manchester City drew with Hull, did he sense this was the day Chelsea, who extended their lead at the top of the table to seven points, ran away with the title? Apparently not.

‘In another country I would say fantastic,’ said Mourinho, ‘in this country I would say it is difficult, every game is difficult. We still have 14 games left and 42 points to play for. I think it’s nothing. I am surprised with nothing. Somebody told me city’s result after the game but it doesn’t matter. When you are top of the league you don’t need other teams to lose points.’

Lambert was optimistic despite a fourth straight defeat and said a major psychological weight had been lifted by Jores Okore headed goal in the 48th minute, which ended a barren spell in the top flight of 660 minutes. The assist came from Carles Gil, who on early impressions looks good value for the £3.25million paid to Valencia for him. The Spaniard beat Oscar down the right flank and whipped an arching ball into the box for Okore to pounce on.

‘Getting a goal is a big moment for us,’ said Lambert, ‘If we get into a run of games where we play like that hopefully we can pick up a lot of points. It’s not just about getting 17th we want to get up as high as we can. I just told the players that in the dressing room. We were up against team who will be close to winning the Champions League so it was a good performance for us.’

Chelsea, without Diego Costa, serving the second of a three match ban for an apparent stamp on Liverpool’s Emre Can, and the injured Cesc Fabregas, hit their stride quickly. Eden Hazard put them ahead after just eight minutes. Oscar neatly brought the ball to his feet and supplied Willian whose angled ball into the box was slotted neatly past Brad Guzan by the Belgian.

After equalizing through Okore, the home fans erupted into a chorus of ‘we score when we want’ but 20 minutes later order was restored as Branislav Ivanovic nabbed the winner.

The ever reliable Serb struck sweetly with his right foot inside the box, firing into the top corner after Okore and Fabian Delph failed to clear a Cesar Azpilicueta cross.

Chelsea’s new signing Juan Cuadrado was also given a run out for the final 16 minutes. The 26-year-old from the tropical north coast of Colombia seemed to enjoy his brief trip to the wind beaten West Midlands, winning a corner with his first foray into the English game.
