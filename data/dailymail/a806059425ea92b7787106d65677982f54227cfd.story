A rare and valuable copy of William Shakespeare's First Folio - the first-ever compilation of the Bard's plays - has been uncovered in a provincial library in France.

The 1623 book, which is one of the most coveted in the world, lay undiscovered among hundreds of others in St-Omer, near Calais, for some 400 years.

Worth up to £3.5 million ($5.5 million), it was discovered when librarian Remy Cordonnier dusted off a book of Shakespeare's works for an exhibition.

Because it is in English, it is thought that French readers overlooked the work, despite its huge literary importance.

'It occurred to me that it could be an unidentified First Folio, with historic importance and great intellectual value,' Mr Cordonnier told AFP.

Shakespeare received comparatively little acclaim for his work up until his death in 1616 but, seven years later, two of his best friends, John Heminge and Henry Condell, produced a collection of 36 of his plays.

Known as the First Folio, it was an authentic record of comedies, histories and tragedies which originally sold for £1 ($1.60).

It was designed, according to the editors, 'only to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive, as was our Shakespeare'.

It is believed that the copy found in France was taken to Saint-Omer by English refugees from Anglican persecution, said Mr Cordonnier. 

The copy of the book, which was published seven years after Shakespeare's death, was authenticated on Saturday by First Folio expert Eric Rasmussen from the University of Nevada.

'It is the 231st copy found in the world and the second in France,' said Mr Cordonnier.

The book, a compilation of 36 of Shakespeare's plays, is in good condition but missing about 30 pages, including the title page, which could explain how it went unnoticed for centuries.

Dr Rasmussen wrote a book on the First Folio called The Shakespeare Thefts, detailing his thrilling global hunt for what remains of the initial 750 copies of the book, a favourite for thieves across the centuries.

He describes 'run-ins with heavily tattooed criminal street gangs in Tokyo, bizarre visits with eccentric, reclusive billionaires, and intense battles of wills with secretive librarians,' according to the publisher.

Dr Rasmussen's book speaks of several First Folios, which have had pages ripped out of them, and one with a bullet lodged in it.

The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington said on its website that the First Folio is the only source for 18 of Shakespeare's plays, including Macbeth, 'which would otherwise be lost.'

Was Shakespeare depressed? Simon Russell Beale, who played King Lear in Sam Mendes production at the National Theatre, left, says the Bard, right, must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature'

William Shakespeare was probably depressed when he wrote King Lear, featured in the First Folio, and decided to change its ending at the last minute to kill off all the major characters, experts have said.

Simon Russell Beale, who played the main character in Sam Mendes' recent production at the National Theatre, said it is so 'savage' the Bard must have been going through a 'bad patch'.

Shakespeare's celebrated tragedy, written between 1605 and 1606, ends with Lear collapsing and dying on top of his daughter Cordelia, after she is hanged.

Throughout the play, Lear's empire and his own health declines as he suffers disaster after disaster while deceitful, conniving and murderous characters help destroy his life.

Mr Beale, who has considered Shakespeare's state of mind for the BBC Four documentary The Secret Life of Books, said the playwright must have 'temporarily lost faith in human nature'.

He wrote Lear at the same time as Timon of Athens, and describes them both as 'savage'. 

'So perhaps, I'm suggesting, he himself was depressed. He temporarily lost faith in human nature.It must have been very depressing to write. It's as if Shakespeare can't stop this flow of invective and bile.' 

There was an engraved portrait of Shakespeare on the title page - one of the very few which have allowed people to get any idea of what the so-called 'Bard of Avon' actually looked like.

It is believed that the copy found in France was taken to Saint-Omer by English refugees from Anglican persecution, said Mr Cordonnier.

Library director Francoise Ducroquet said France would not sell the book, and that it would be stored in the library's safe with other precious items.
