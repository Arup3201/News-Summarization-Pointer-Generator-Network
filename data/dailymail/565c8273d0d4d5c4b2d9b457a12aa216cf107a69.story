The producers of hit BBC drama Sherlock are under pressure to fast-track new episodes in order to get the programme back on television in time for next Christmas.

Following the success of the New Year's Day episode of Sherlock, which attracted over 13 million viewers when catch-up services are factored in, the BBC is understood to be eager to bill the programme as the main event in its Christmas 2014 schedule.

The news comes after the BBC was rocked by a surge in people watching ITV over the festive period, with healthy numbers for both Downton Abbey and Coronation Street - the latter of which beat Eastenders' Christmas Day viewing figures for the first time in over a decade.

More than 10 million people are expected to have tuned in to last night's series three finale of Sherlock, which ended on a cliffhanger.

The series began with the New Year's Day special after a two year wait, and was criticised in some quarters for failing to answer questions about how the world's most famous detective 
faked his own death in the final episode of the previous series.

Speaking to the Sun, a BBC insider said: 'The BBC is desperate for a Sherlock Christmas Day special this year. It wants its biggest guns ready.'

Sherlock creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have already admitted sketching out ideas for a fourth and fifth series, with the current story arc leaving the door open for new episodes.

The long-awaited third series takes place two years after Sherlock was seen hurling himself from the roof of St Bart's Hospital, London, in an apparent suicide

All that is believed to be required for a Sherlock Christmas Day special to be confirmed is confirmation that its stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman can agree to start filming in spring.

Earlier this week it was revealed that Sherlock now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time, overtaking the 2011 Downton Abbey Christmas special, which received 3.1 million views through ITV Player.

The New Year's Day episode attracted over 10 million viewers during its initial broadcast, raising to 13 million when catch-up services are factored in.

Although so-called 'cult' dramas such as Sherlock are incredibly popular and therefore naturally attract a large numbers of views, it is thought that their fans also tend to watch them during their initial broadcast, then re-watch one or more times through a catch-up service.
