Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said wants to hit better-off homeowners with the mansion tax in the next financial year

Labour has asked the Treasury to start drawing up plans to levy its mansion tax on 100,000 expensive homes from day one of regaining power.

Despite a revolt from some Labour MPs over the annual levy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said he aimed to hit better-off homeowners in the next financial year.

Although it is unusual for a tax to be introduced in the course of a financial year, Mr Balls said he wanted to start raising money from the rich in order to plough it into the NHS as quickly as possible.

He said Treasury officials were already working on the proposals, in line with the civil service practice of making plans to implement the policies of parties that could win a forthcoming election.

Labour and Liberal Democrat plans for a mansion tax had been in doubt after George Osborne’s dramatic reform of stamp duty at the Autumn Statement, which have made buying a home worth £1million or more far more expensive.

Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said his party would stick with its policy of an annual levy – but suggested it may have to be amended following the Chancellor’s changes.

Labour opponents of the party’s own mansion tax scheme have also stepped up their campaign to persuade Mr Balls to shift his position.

But the Shadow Chancellor insisted in an interview with the Independent: ‘Saving the NHS will be at the heart of our first Budget. I would like to see that revenue coming in in the first year of a Labour government, before the end of the financial year. We will have to see the practicalities.’

Mr Balls denied charges could be imposed retrospectively. ‘A charge is paid in that year on the valuation on a date in that year. No one will have any doubt about our intentions,’ he insisted.

The Coalition has sought to undermine Mr Balls’s pledge to raise £2.5billion for the NHS through a combination of the mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and reducing tax avoidance by hedge funds by announcing its own £3billion boost.

Critics also pointed out that revenues from these measures were unlikely to start flowing in until the middle of the next Parliament.

However, Mr Balls said Labour could legislate for the mansion tax to start in the following financial year of 2016-17 ‘as a backstop’.

Labour’s mansion tax will be about £3,000 a year for homes in the £2million to £3million bracket. Experts say an average charge of £11,000 a year will need to be levied to raise the £1.2billion a year Labour predicts.

The Conservatives claim it will be extended to cover cheaper properties.
