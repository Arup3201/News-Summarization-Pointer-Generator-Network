A teenager appeared in court last night charged with killing a schoolboy at the weekend.

The 16-year-old, from Kilmarnock, was charged with murder over the death of 13-year-old Jon Wilson.

The schoolboy, from Gateside Place in Kilmarnock, was found with serious head injuries and was left fighting for his life after the attack in Queen's Drive in Kilmarnock in the early hours of Sunday morning.

He died at Crosshouse Hospital yesterday. His family are said to be 'devastated' at his death, a neighbour said.

Hundreds of Facebook messages have also been posted online paying tribute to the schoolboy.

Jon's aunt Irene Wilson paid tribute to her nephew.

She told the Daily Record: 'Jon was a quiet boy who spent most of his time playing with his Xbox. He didn't run in gangs or bring any bother to his door.

'He was a generous boy and he would give you his last.'

Cathy Jamieson, Scottish Labour MP for Kilmarnock, said: 'This is such a tragic waste of a young life'

She said the family, who were at his bedside when he died, had 'no idea' why he was in the street at that time of night.

The 16-year-old made no plea and no declaration when he appeared at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court and was remanded in custody. No date was fixed for his next appearance.

Gillian Cochrane, a neighbour of the Wilson family, said Jon's death was a 'tragedy'.

'His family are devastated,' she said.

Pupils at Kilmarnock Academy, where Jon was a student, are being offered counselling over the schoolboy's death.

An East Ayrshire Council spokeswoman said: 'Our thoughts are presently with his family and friends, to whom we extend our sincerest condolences.'

Cathy Jamieson, Scottish Labour MP for Kilmarnock, said: 'This is such a tragic waste of a young life.

'My thoughts are with the family of the victim and members of the Kilmarnock community who are as shocked as I am that such a terrible incident could take place on the town's streets.'
