My search for the A-List experience brings me to Grace Belgravia, the women-only members club that caters to London's health conscious elite.

Rumoured members include the ultra-fashionable Delevingne sisters; it's said that supermodel sister Cara prepped for one of her high profile runway shows through these very hallowed halls.

Turning up through the front doors I feel as if I've stepped into a billionaire's private home instead of being in a high-end medi spa.

'Prevention is the medicine of the millennium', says Dr Tim Evans, one of the country's most prominent physicians. 

It's immediately apparent to me, that when you are a member of the A-list, looking after your health means more than attending a Nutri-Bullet or a Kettlebell class once a week.

It's a full-body, bespoke, luxury experience.

I signed on for their three-day cleanse which is a combination of traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture, fitness, spa treatments, and nutritional advice and menus.

An MOT of sorts, the cleanse offers those seeking to overhaul their lifestyles a nudge in the right direction.

My first initiation is with TCM practitioner Ross Campbell who will help design my personal cleanse. His manner is warm and inviting and we speak about the birth of my baby, where my health can improve and how I can achieve my goals.

Notes based on my consultation will be put on file and all the other therapists will refer to them for the next three days, ensuring that everyone tailors their approach based on my specific needs.

Being A-list is all about personalised services; nothing is ever general. 

The cleanse kicks off with a blood test consultation with one of the country's most prominent physicians, Dr. Tim Evans. His private patient list is so exclusive I had to sign an NDA not to name names. He gives me an analysis of my blood test, going through virtually every single facet of my health.

He assures me that 'prevention is the medicine of the millennium' and encourages me to think proactively about my health, adding that 'good health begins with accepting responsibility for one's own health and wellbeing.'

Lofty words, but between this and the atmosphere – I spotted a willowy supermodel in the changing room – I have only been here a few hours and am already kind of sold on this place.

My day continues in the gym, set up by Matt Roberts who trains Samantha Cameron, Naomi Campbell and Amanda Holden. I have a Pilates session with handsome trainer Jason, who quickly picks up on the fact that my abdominal wall still hasn't closed since I gave birth. He recommends exercises I can do help the process. 

The spa is 'beyond gorgeous' and has the only flotation tank in the UK

This is swiftly followed by 'diet' lunch in the very glamorous restaurant which is comparable to any five-star restaurant. Honestly, if I could eat like this at every meal I would be super skinny by now. It's all been set up to be easily digestible; dishes are gluten-, sugar-, dairy- and caffeine-free.

As you can probably surmise, the spa is beyond gorgeous.

I have 'Face Therapy; which uses lymphatic suction and Chinese acupressure to tighten skin and fight wrinkles. I emerge looking less jowly and a little brighter.

Next is a Traditional Chinese Medicine body balancing treatment, followed by a gentle but thorough colonic, and then, probably the best massage of my life, performed by Makiko, a trained osteopath from Japan.

Then it's on to Hydrotherapy – water, steam, sea salt and essential oils all combined in a mixture of hot and cold temperatures.

I start with a blistering sauna after which I stand under at 15-foot Vichy Shower on the 'cool fog' setting. Note to Grace – it really should be called Arctic Fog.

Then it's into the steam room followed by the far more soothing 'Tropical Rain' setting.

The treatment continues with a sea salt scrub, and a spirulina body wrap. And ends with a shower therapy where jets of water sway up and down from the ceiling on top of me, offering a delightful kind of water massage.

I can't leave without stealing a few moments in the flotation tank. It's the only one in the UK, and I make sure to spend several moments gently buoyant on a soft, warm cushion atop waves.

After three days I literally feel as if I am floating out of the building when I leave for the evening.

At £1,900 the treatment doesn't come cheap. But it was, without exaggeration, some of loveliest days of my life and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

Grace Belgravia has launched a taster of the new cleanse for those keen to sample the lifestyle.

Grace Deli'Very, their new home food delivery service, has six menus which have been artfully devised by their expert team of nutritionists and chefs and is available on their website.

At £42.50 per day I'm seriously tempted to give it a go – maybe I can find a Kettlebell class somewhere too.
