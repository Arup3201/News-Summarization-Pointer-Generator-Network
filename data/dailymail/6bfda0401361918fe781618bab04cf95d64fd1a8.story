Jailed: PCSO Liam Austerfield was sentenced to 15 months today for grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl online

A police community support officer has been jailed today for grooming a 14-year-old schoolgirl online and begging her to send him explicit pictures.

Liam Austerfield, 28, had over 300 exchanges with the child by text and Facebook when police seized his mobile phone, laptop and computer.

During one exchange he sent an indecent picture of himself and told her: 'If you want to see more you have to show more'.

Today Austerfield was jailed for 15 months at Sheffield Crown Court.

He had admitted three counts of making indecent images of children, one count 
of possessing 13 indecent images of a child and one count of inciting a 
child to engage in sexual activity.

The 28-year-old was serving with the North West neighbourhood policing team in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, at the time of the offences.

He was suspended from duty while an investigation was carried out, prompted by concerns raised by the girl's parents, and he resigned from West Yorkshire  Police in April.

The court heard that communication between Austerfield and the girl 'started on innocent terms but after a short period of time it turned to topics of a sexual nature'.

Michael Rawlinson, prosecuting, said: 'He requested naked images of her but the girl didn't send naked images despite his requests.

'She sent pictures of herself in her pyjamas and her bra and knickers instead.

'He knew full well how old this complainant was.'

Jailing Austerfield, Judge Roger Keen QC said: 'Instead of behaving properly, you abused the trust the community placed in you in order to gain sexual satisfaction.

'You have brought a great deal of distress to your own family but more importantly your actions have had a profound effect on your victim and her  family.

'Your position if further aggravated because of your work at the time.

'You corrupted this girl and as a consequence her life has been greatly affected.

'Your position in the community takes this well outside the appropriate guidelines.'

After police seized his mobile phone and laptop following his arrest on March 21, they discovered Austerfield had searched the internet for 'pre-teen taboo'.

Mr Rawlinson said Austerfield claimed to be 'heavily intoxicated when the worst of the incidents took place and could recall very little about them'.

Describing the victim impact statements written by the girl's parents, Mr Rawlinson said: 'Her mum feels that the incident has destroyed her family due  to the stress of it.

'She has separated from the girl's father following so many arguments and she blames herself for what happened. She feels it has set her daughter back a very great deal.'

Alison Dorrell, mitigating, said: 'This is a serious breach of trust. He was well aware from the outset of her age.

'He has lost his good character. He has lost a career he enjoyed and he now has no prospect of ever becoming a police officer.

'He has thrown away all the progress he at 28 had made in his life. His family are dismayed at having to support him through a crown court case.

'He spent two years working in the community and he had been well thought of.'
