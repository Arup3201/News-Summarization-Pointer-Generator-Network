Comedian Margaret Cho's North Korea-mocking Golden Globes bit immediately earned her scorn from outraged viewers who called it cartoonish and racist.

Now the Korean-American funnygal, whose goose-stepping General Cho Young Ja character managed to stir more controversy than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's Bill Cosby jokes, has hit back at her detractors.

'I'm of mixed North/South Korean descent - you imprison, starve and brainwash my people you get made fun of by me #hatersgonhate #FreeSpeech,' Cho tweeted Monday morning.

Racist? Korean-American actress and comedian Margaret Cho was called out on Twitter following a Sony-hack inspired bit in which she played a cartoonish North Korean general at the Golden Globes

No regrets: Cho hit back at the accusations Monday morning on Twitter, where she refused to apologize

'Rice card': More than just unapologetic, cho responded to criticism with another joke that some might see as racially insensitive

For those who missed the controversial comedy bits, they began at the top of the show when Fey and Poehler introduced the general.

‘The Hollywood Foreign Association comprises journalists from all around the globe and we would like to now introduce you to our newest HFPA member. A contributor to Movies Wow magazine and a North Korean army general; Cho Yung Ja. Welcome.’

Movies Wow, it turned out, featured none other than supreme leader and the alleged vengeful mind behind the recent Sony email hacks--Kim Jong-un.

As Cho Yung Ja, Ms Cho demanded a photo opportunity with Streep, who gamely stood with the faux soldier and smiled for a photo snapped by Michael Keaton.

From behind, actor Benedict Cumberbatch leapt up for a photobomb. 

Too cartoonish? Cho has long imitated her Korean immigrant mother, but some viewers were appalled by her act on Sunday night

After the snap was taken, Fey said: ‘Thank you, crisis averted. God Bless.’

In a room full of movie stars - many affected by the embarrassing Sony hack - it all seemed like good fun. But then the Twitter reaction came hard and swift.

'I've always loved margaret cho but she needs to stop shuckin' for white folk,' wrote @LordeBarrington.

@HoJoLego agreed: 'This is the worst Margaret Cho joke ever. #GoldenGlobes'

As did @BougieBlackGurl: 'Margaret Cho that was freaking awful. Is she going to shuck and jive too? #GoldenGlobes #whenthechecksstopcoming.' 

The tweets kept coming. The Cho Yung Ja sketch did, too.

Later in the show, Cho appeared onstage in costume and shared her thoughts on the lesbian plot line between Orange Is The New Black characters Alex and Piper, calling their relationship 'very toxic'.

She then proceeded to goose-step off stage. And as their final act in their final Golden Globe hosting gig together, Fey and Poehler even gave Cho the last words of the entire show.

'Show over. I host next year. Good night,' she said in character as Cho Yung Ja while credits rolled. 

On Thursday, Cho was quick to defend her jokes, which she insisted weren't racist.

Margaret Cho had previously appeared in Tina Fey's creation 30 Rock as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il and his son Kim Jong-Un in 2011 (Cho is pictured left with Fey and right, with Tracy Morgan)

'I'm not playing the race card,' she tweeted. 'I'm playing the rice card. #hatersgonwait #winnersgonpun'

Cho appeared in 30 Rock in 2011, the NBC comedy series created by Tina Fey. The 46-year-old actress played North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il in one episode for which she received an Emmy nominaton for Outstanding Guest Actress.

She later returned to the show to play Kim Jon-Il's son Kim Jong-un.
