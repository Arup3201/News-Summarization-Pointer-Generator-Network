The Duchess has been enjoying hot vegetable curries during her pregnancy, made at the shop in her family’s village.

She first stumbled upon the tasty dinners when she went into Peach’s Spar, in Bucklebury, Berkshire, to buy bags of Haribo sweets – another firm favourite.

She then clocked what was cooking in the upstairs kitchen. Chan Shingadia, who runs the convenience store with wife Hash, said: ‘My wife was cooking.

Kate said it smelled lovely.’ Mrs Shingadia added: ‘She said she had a craving so I made her a big batch to take away with rice and flatbreads.’ 

The Gujarati curry proved such a hit Kate has been a regular visitor. ‘She last popped in a couple of weeks ago,’ said Mrs Shingadia.
