A school at the centre of the Islamist ‘Trojan Horse’ takeover plot has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism.

The report - made public yesterday but 
leaked to the Daily Mail on Monday - revealed Golden Hillock, in Birmingham, 
was doing 'too little to keep students safe from the risks associated 
with extremist views'.

It was placed in special measures after 
Ofsted noted ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex 
and relationships education was not taught properly.

Denial: Golden Hillock school (pictured) has refused to accept the findings of an Ofsted report that claimed it is failing to do enough to protect children from extremism. The charges were rejected as politically motivated

The charges have been rejected by the school’s management as being 
politically motivated. A statement from the school said it disputed the 
validity of the inspection.

Golden
 Hillock secondary school in Sparkbrook is one of three managed by the 
Park View Educational Trust - all of which are believed to have been 
rated inadequate.

A
 Trust spokesman said Ofsted found no evidence that Golden Hillock 
either promoted or tolerated extremism or radicalisation. It added it 
did not accept Ofsted findings that the school was inadequate.’

It
 said: 'The Trust does not accept the findings of the Ofsted report, 
which mischaracterises the school, and is now challenging it through the
 appropriate legal channels.'

Golden 
Hillock was one of 21 schools inspected after a letter - now widely 
believed to be a hoax - referred to an alleged plot by hard-line Muslims
 to seize control of governing boards in the city, dubbed Operation 
Trojan Horse.

The
 Trojan Horse letter, which was unsigned, undated and first sent to 
council officials and teaching unions late last year, has sparked 
several separate investigations including by Birmingham City Council, 
West Midlands Police, the Department for Education and Ofsted.

In
 its statement, PVET, said it believed that the inspections had been 
conducted 'in a climate of fear created by the 'Trojan Horse' letter'.

Controversy: Park View School, which is at the centre of the Trojan Horse plot allegations, has been accused of segregating women and children during lessons

Inspectors
 who visited Golden Hillock concluded that the school was not doing 
enough to raise students' awareness of 'risks of extremism', according 
to PVET's statement.

But
 the Trust said it was crucial to note that Ofsted's report contained no
 suggestion, or evidence, that the school either promotes or tolerates 
extremism or radicalisation.

It added 
that it disputed the inspectorate's finding that there had been slow 
progress in ensuring that staff had been trained in recognising the 
signs of radicalisation and how to tailor their teaching to counter 
this.

And it claimed a finding that students are not being properly prepared for life in modern Britain was a 'misrepresentation'.

It said: 'On behalf of the staff, students and parents who have worked so hard to improve their school, we are extremely disappointed to confirm that Ofsted has decided to place Golden Hillock in special measures.'

Education: Michael Gove has been accused of 'sitting on' warnings of Trojan Horse plots since 2010

'While we support the role of Ofsted in holding schools to account in a fair and transparent way, we wholeheartedly dispute the validity of these gradings. Golden Hillock is categorically not an inadequate school. It is also crucial to note that the school had been part of Park View Educational Trust for just five months at the time of the Ofsted inspection in March 2014.

'A number of the judgments are based on data and information that pre-date the Trust's involvement.'

PVET runs three schools, including Park View Academy which has been at the centre of some of the most serious allegations. In the past, Trust chairman Tahir Alam has called the allegations 'a witch-hunt.'

Earlier this week, it was revealed that three other schools inspected by Ofsted had been given a clean bill of health.

The Birmingham-based schools published letters received from the watchdog which all found governance and leadership to be either good or outstanding - the highest rating available - and concluding that child-safeguarding standards were being met.

Ninestiles School - an academy in Acocks Green - Small Heath School and Washwood Heath Academy were the first to publish the results of their inspections, after Education Secretary Michael Gove sent Ofsted in over the Trojan Horse allegations.

A separate over-arching report by the head of Ofsted and Chief Inspector of Schools Sir Michael Wilshaw is expected to be published next week, along with any remaining Ofsted reports for the individual schools concerned.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: 'Gender discrimination, undue influence of extremist views, the school curriculum influenced by hard-line beliefs. This report confirms that Michael Gove can no longer seek to distance himself from this episode. He is responsible.'

'In 2010, Michael Gove was warned by a highly respected Birmingham headteacher that this was going on. Four years on, he has failed to act and has not explained why.'

'Rightly, his record is now being called into question. Rather than rowing with Theresa May, he needs to answer why he has refused to act.'
