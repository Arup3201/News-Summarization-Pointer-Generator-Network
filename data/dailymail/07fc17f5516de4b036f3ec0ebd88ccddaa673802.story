British tennis found itself with a ready made second top 100 player on when Aljaz Bedene, the world No 83, announced that he is now a UK citizen.

The 25-year-old is originally from Slovenia but since 2008 has lived in Welwyn Garden City with his girlfriend Kimalie, a pop star in her native land who is a protegee of renowned record producer Jeff Wayne.

Bedene attended a citizenship ceremony in Hatfield on Tuesday and posted pictures of the occasion. He will formally receive his passport within the next two weeks and start entering tournaments as a British player.

Aljaz Bedene was born in the Slovenian capital of Ljublana in 1989 but has made the UK his home since 2008.

The 25-year-old lives in Hertfordshire and trains at Gosling Sports Park in Welwyn Garden City with British coach James Davidson and fitness trainer Martin Skinner.

Bedene's career-high ranking was No 71 in February 2013 and he reached his first ATP tour final earlier this year when he finished runner-up at the Chennai Open in January.

However, whether he can play Davis Cup for GB is a different matter, as he has three times been in the Slovenian squad, albeit never having played a 'live' rubber. He is appealing a new rule banning players from representing two nations on the basis that his citizenship application was being processed at the time. 

'Today is one of the most special days of my life,' said Bedene. 'This has been a long process and to gain citizenship almost seven years to the day after arriving is just overwhelming.

'This is something I have wanted since the moment I stepped foot in this beautiful country and I feel honoured to be able to compete under the Union Jack on the ATP Tour. Davis Cup is another dream and one I will have to fight for with everything I have.'

Bedene is the most significant British tennis import since Greg Rusedski. A quick and agile baseliner, he has already been ranked No 71 in the world and after being held back by injuries last year ought to be heading into the top 50 before too long.

He has long been managed by Stevenage-based firm Global Tennis Connections and has a British coach in James Davidson. He has actually represented Hertfordshire in the County Cup, the team being captained by tennis nut Wayne, famous for his War of the Worlds production.

Bedene will now slot in as British No 2 although it must be highly unlikely he could play in the Davis Cup quarter-final after Wimbledon against France, especially after James Ward's heroics against the USA in the first round. 

The likes of Ward, who has been a stalwart of the Davis Cup team through thick and thin, might understandably be peeved were Bedene suddenly to walk into the team. Otherwise there should not be too much friction as Bedene, who is certainly not a product of the LTA or the British game, is not competing for wildcards or funding.

Andy Murray has welcomed the news of Bedene's switch and feels that he could be a useful addition to the Davis Cup team in future years.

Murray told Sky Sports: 'I don't know him extremely well but I know that he's obviously playing some very good tennis right now.

'I think maybe in the future it's possible for him to be involved in the Davis Cup team but I'm not sure exactly what the rules are.

'I know the rules change a little bit this year, that you're not allowed to play for two countries, so I'm not 100 per cent sure if he's going to be eligible.

'This year we have a team that's being doing extremely well and I would expect that this year we would stick with that team and revisit it again in the future if he becomes eligible.'

British No 4 Liam Broady - who will drop to No 5 when Bedene officially starts representing Britain on the tour - was also warm in his reaction, tweeting: 'Welcome to GB mate.'
