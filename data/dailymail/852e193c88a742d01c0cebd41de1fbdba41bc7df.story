As crowds of jubilant well-wishers mobbed the front of St Mary's tonight to celebrate the birth of the new third-in-line to the throne, the Royal couple's bodyguards made another important delivery out of view.

Royal close-protection officers were seen delivering two pizzas to the rear entrance to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to her son this afternoon.

The snacks will be well-needed. Kate endured a labour of nearly half a day to deliver the baby boy, who was born at 4.24pm GMT weighing a healthy 8lb 6oz.

A much needed delivery... One of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's close-protection officers turns up with two pizzas from Zizzi's at 8.45pm, after leaving 10 minutes before the announcement of the Royal birth

The plain-clothes policeman arrived at the discreet back entrance to St Mary's at 8.45pm, having left ten minutes before the Palace made the announcement of the Royal birth.

His timing suggests that, having given themselves several hours private time after the birth of their son, the Duke and Duchess are now ready to settle down and observe the national celebration their happy arrival has prompted.

After her 11-hour labour, Kate will need to stock up her body with carbohydrates, with a pizza the ideal source of sustenance to top up her depleted energy reserves.

Without eating soon after the struggle of giving birth, there is the risk her body could go into ketosis - where the body starts burning fat for energy - which can lead to nausea, vomiting and headaches.

William, Kate and their child are to spend the night together on the private Lindo Ward at St Mary's, where specialists can make sure everything is okay.

Meanwhile, at the front of St Mary's: Self-proclaimed Town Crier Tony Appleton celebrates among the crowd outside the hospital after the birth of the Cambridges' new son was revealed to the world

Outside, waiting Royal fans burst into celebration when the news was announced.

Self-appointed town crier Tony Appleton stood in full ceremonial dress to lead the party as dozens of others dressed in Union flag regalia danced and sang in the streets.

The first indication many of those waiting in the streets may have had was when Royal aide Ed Perkins emerged from the front doors of St Mary's carrying a document in a folder which he passed to a waiting driver.

The document was then rushed across central London to Buckingham Palace, where the Queen's Press Secretary Ailsa Anderson with Badar Azim, a footman, placed the official document on an easel in view of crowds waiting there.

But in a digital age where news travels almost instantaneously, waiting well-wishers had an advance warning of the revelations.

One man shouted: 'It's a boy,' prompting crowds to erupt into spontaneous cheering, ahead of the easel being placed in the forecourt.

There were three cheers of 'hip hip hooray,' as the crowd outside the palace gates swelled to more than 10 deep. Euphoric fans sang happy birthday, welcoming the new prince into the world.

But unaware of the the scenes of jubilation he has caused, the newest addition to the Royal family will be in the loving arms of his parents as they come to terms with their new life as a family.Â
