Liverpool defender Jon Flanagan is keen to win back his place in the side once he regains full fitness.

The 21-year-old filled in at left-back for much of last season, making 25 appearances on the opposite flank to which he usually operates covering for the injured Jose Enrique.

Flanagan picked up an injury himself during pre-season which has prevented his involvement so far and the arrivals of Javier Manquillo and Alberto Moreno have increased competition in both full-back positions.

But the Reds academy graduate is eager to start putting pressure on the new signings.

'I don't think it will be too long now and I think I should be back after the international break if all goes well,' Flanagan told Liverpoolfc.com.

'It has been frustrating for me but I can't dwell on it. It was tough to pick up the injury in pre-season but I've just got to forget about that now and push on.

Increased competition: Full-back Alberto Moreno joined the club in the summer

'It's going to be tough but I'm more determined than ever. It's a massive season for me and I just can't wait to get back now.

'There's a lot more competition for places, which is good for us.

'The manager has strengthened the squad with the new signings, so I've got to continue to work hard and then hopefully get a chance.'
