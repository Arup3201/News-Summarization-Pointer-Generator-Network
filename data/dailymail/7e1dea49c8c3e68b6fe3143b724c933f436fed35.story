The reclusive widow of a wealthy property tycoon is battling her two stepsons in court over her share of her late husband's £7million fortune.

Clive Zola Berger warned his sons that he would be 'watching' from beyond the grave to ensure they did not clash with their stepmother Rosana Berger after his death. 

But Mrs Berger, 84, who barely leaves her £4.25million Surrey mansion, says her requests for more money from her husband's estate have been met with 'stony silence'.

Rosana Berger is locked in a court dispute with her two stepsons over her share of her late husband's fortune

She said her husband wanted her to live the rest of her days in comfort.

However, she claims her income is not enough to cover the cost of maintaining eight-bedroom Abbotswood, in Godalming and its 30 acres.

Mrs Berger said she also needs more money to cover the £33,000 a year she pays her domestic help.

She is now asking the courts to effectively re-write her husband's will to ensure that 'reasonable provision' is made for her in her autumn years.

However, her stepsons, Julian and Jonathan Berger, both high-powered solicitors, deny she has been hard done by and say her claim to need an income of over £220,000-a-year is over the top.

Mrs Berger was told by a judge last year that she had left it too late to make her claim, but Lord Justice Lloyd has now opened a new chapter in the dispute by granting her permission to mount a full Appeal Court challenge to that decision.

Penelope Reed QC, for Mrs Berger, said her husband, a solicitor turned property mogul, meant for his second wife to have a 'substantial' income after his death in June, 2005.

In a letter written his son Julian before his 
death, Mr Berger pleaded: 'Make absolutely sure that the estate is
not involved in the arguments and problems that can so often arise in 
probate. I shall be watching.'

The family's dispute has reached the Court of Appeal despite Clive Berger's pleas to his sons not to allow arguments between them and his warning that he will 'be watching' from beyond the grave

The couple both had children from 
previous relationships, lived together for 36 years and she helped to 
raise her step-children from a young age, the court heard.

Her husband's will directed that she be 
allowed to stay in Abbotswood rent free for life. He also left her his 
50 per cent stake in their £1.2million home in Arizona, which she has 
since sold, placing the proceeds in a U.S. trust for tax reasons, the QC
added.

Her children also received property.

The remainder of the estate - largely made up of at least £2.9million worth of shares in property company, Circle Land Ltd - was put into a trust, with Mr Berger issuing instructions that it be used to 'maximise' his widow's income for life.

Mrs Berger, who suffers from arthritis and angina, says dividends from the company are not enough.

'The result is that her capital has been steadily depleting,' Miss Reed told the court.

The widow, who says she lives 'largely as a recluse', hopes to sell Abbotswood - and replace it with a flat worth up to £3million in west London's upmarket Bayswater, the court heard.

And it is hoped that any money left over after a replacement property is found could be used to supplement her income - but that is only if Abbotswood sells for its massive valuation.

The widow claims that, when she told her stepsons she needed more money, she was 'met with a stony silence'.

They insist their stepmother's income demands are excessive and that she would have had ample funds if profits from the sale of the Arizona property were not tied up in a trust.

Judge Rodger Hayward Smith QC threw out Mrs Berger's bid to up her income last year on the basis that her case had been brought to court almost six years outside the normal six-month time limit, running from the date on which the will was admitted to probate.

Her stepsons - one a director of Circle Land and the other a 'de facto director' - had decided to plough much of the firm's income into refurbishing its property portfolio.

And the judge observed: 'Such a long-term investment strategy is likely to be of considerable benefit to Julian and Jonathan on Mrs Berger's death. It is now and likely to remain of little benefit to her unless she lives to a very great age'.

Judge Hayward Smith said that Mrs Berger had enjoyed 'a high standard of living' before her husband's death but described her request for an income of £222,540-a-year from his estate as 'very inflated'.

Giving her permission to appeal, however, Lord Justice Lloyd said: 'There seems to be a reasonable prospect of success, given the position of Mrs Berger as a widow.'

Her full appeal will be heard by three Appeal Court judges at a later date.
