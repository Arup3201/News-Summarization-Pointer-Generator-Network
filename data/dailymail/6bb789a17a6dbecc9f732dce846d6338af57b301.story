Sex attacker Robert Gwyn Lewis wrote a song about his victim which included the lyrics 'I hope you die'

A sex attacker wrote a song about his victim which included the lyrics ‘I hope you die’ and posted it on Facebook to try and intimidate her.

Robert Gwyn Lewis, 31, of Deeside, in Flintshire, North Wales, also threatened kill the woman in person to prevent her from giving evidence against him.

Lewis was jailed for nine years after he admitted sexual assault by penetration and physical assault on the woman at Mold Crown Court. He also admitted to perverting the course of justice.

Elen Owen, prosecuting, said the victim found the song particularly upsetting and felt sick when she saw it.

In the song, he repeated the chorus ‘I hope you die’ – and described her as ‘a scumbag and a liar’. The song also included the words ‘I hope you get AIDS’, and Lewis threatened to ‘poke out both your eyes.’

Later, when the two came face to face, he shouted at her, telling the woman he would kill her if she testified in court. He told her: ‘I can destroy your whole world.’

The earlier sex attacks had occurred when the defendant visited the victim’s home.

The crimes included an incident in which he gripped her around the throat and the woman thought she was going to die.

Judge Phillip Hughes said that the sexual offences were the most serious and jailed him for eight years. He received concurrent 12 month sentences for the physical assaults on her.

The judge also imposed an additional 12 month consecutive sentence for perverting the course of justice by trying to intimidate the victim out of giving evidence.

The judge described the song he performed on Facebook about her as ‘threatening, abusive, nasty [and] ugly’. He said it was intended to cause as much upset as he could.

Kim Halsall, defending, said that the defendant, who had no previous convictions, was full of shame and remorse at what he had done.

He had admitted the offences which had prevented the victim from reliving her ordeal in court.

The judge ordered Lewis - who closed his eyes when the nine year sentence was announced - to register with the police as a sex offender for life.

He also made a restraining order not to approach his victim in any way - including by social media.
