An investigation has been launched after thieves drilled through a pipeline underneath Nick Clegg's official country residence and siphoned £8.3million worth of fuel.

Police said the gang stole about 30,000 litres of fuel a day over a period of seven months from the pipe underneath Chevening House estate, which is shared by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary.

The fuel was funnelled along a 1,600 foot pipe to an area just outside the 3,500 acre estate near Sevenoaks, Kent, and pumped into huge plastic containers aboard lorries.

The theft was discovered on Wednesday after new security measures were introduced on Esso's South East Pipeline, The Sun reported.

The line, which is 120 miles long, carries fuel from Fawley Refinery in Hampshire to Purfleet Fuel Terminal and Gatwick.

Kent Police said initial indications were that it had been 'a well organised crime'.

A spokesman said: 'Kent Police was notified of some tampering to a fuel pipeline in the Sevenoaks area on August 6.

'Initial indications are that this was a well organised crime, employing highly specialist techniques to siphon fuel from pipelines which operate at very high pressure.'

A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: 'We are aware of an ongoing police investigation. For more details talk to Kent Police.'

Esso was not immediately available for comment.
