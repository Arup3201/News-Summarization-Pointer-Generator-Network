New Jersey Governor Chris Christie could be impeached if the team investigating the 'Bridgegate' scandal find he knew the motive behind the George Washington Bridge closures.

Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who is leading the investigation, said he didn't find Christie's denials credible when so many of his close aides appeared to be involved.

Christie, who was widely tipped to run for president in 2016, has denied any prior knowledge of an apparent plan to use lane closures on the bridge as payback against a mayor who failed to endorse his re-election.

Mr Wisniewski  told NBC he found it hard to accept Christie knew nothing until the morning of the press conference he held on Thursday, when he said he had been 'stunned by the abject stupidity' of the plan.

'These people travel with him, these 
people discuss things with him every single day. This is not an 
isolated, unknown story,' Mr Wisniewski said of Christie's aides, who were named in the emails and text messages.

'He knew there was an investigation. He knew
 people were looking at it, and his senior staff was involved [and] he 
expects us to believe he knew nothing? I just find that implausible.'

He added: 'Using the George Washington Bridge, a public resource, to exact a political vendetta, is a crime ... Having people use their official 
position to have a political game is a crime. So if those tie back to 
the governor in any way, it clearly becomes an impeachable offense.'

A special session is due to be held on Thursday to re-authorize subpoena power for the investigative committee.

Many are at odds over whether Governor Christie, who was tipped to run for President in 2016, was involved

Governor Christie is under pressure following revelations that his administration may have closed highway lanes to exact political retribution against a Democratic mayor

Mr Wisniewski says he plans to use that power to subpoena official and private emails, text messages and other documents from current and former aides, before calling them in 'one by one' to testify.

Assembly speaker-elect Vincent Prieto, who will head the session on Thursday, told CNN the revelations 'clearly show the need for a continued thorough investigation'.

'Many questions remain unanswered about this threat to public safety and abuse of power,' he added.

Christie's press secretary, Mike Drewniak, did not respond to NBC requests for comment. The Republican governor is still expected to visit Florida next week to help with Governor Rick Scott's re-election campaign.

New Jersey residents also think Christie is lying about Bridgegate, and think he should quit a poll found.

The poll, conducted on 800 likely voters after Christie’s press conference. by Rasmussen Reports, found that 54 per cent of the Garden State’s residents think he knew what was going on.

And 56 per cent said he should resign if it is proven that he approved of the tactic to retaliate against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who refused to endorse Christie’s re-election, according to the poll released by the New York Post.

Only 36 per cent believe Christie’s claim that he was unaware that a top aide orchestrated the politically motivated closing of George Washington Bridge access lanes, the survey showed.

The
 survey also found that 71 per cent suspect that other political figures
 who failed to back Christie had been targeted by the governor’s staff, according to the poll published by the New York Post.

And
 47 per cent believed that members of Christie’s staff who ordered the 
closing should be criminally prosecuted, while 31 per cent said they 
should not.

A poll taken
 by Quinnipiac University immediately before the bridge scandal found 
Christie was the 
‘hottest’ politician in the country when it came to ‘warmth’ and 
favorability, according to the Post.

Last week it was claimed that aides to Christie 
knew traffic closures they spitefully ordered on the George Washington 
Bridge were putting lives at risk after just a few hours – but carried 
on snarling traffic for another four days.

In a lengthy press briefing on Thursday, Christie forcefully denied any involvement.

A port authority employee warned  the bridge lane closures created safety risks, but they continued for four days
