Alexis Sanchez - the man Arsenal believe can fire them to the Barclays Premier League title - has sealed his £30million move from Barcelona.

The Chile superstar, who cut short his holiday to finalise the transfer in London, completed a medical and agreed a four-year contract - with the option of a further 12 months - worth up to £140,000-per-week. The package will put him on a par with current top earner Mesut Ozil.

'I’m so happy to be joining Arsenal, a club which has a great manager, a fantastic squad of players, huge support around the world and a great stadium in London,' said the 25-year-old.

The
 deal paves the way for Liverpool's Luis Suarez to replace him at the 
Nou Camp, with a sum of  £75m touted for the Uruguayan striker.

Ever since Arsene Wenger discovered Sanchez was available, the Chile international has been his No 1 summer transfer target.

And
 Wenger was purring after his first signing of the summer, adding: 'As 
many people have seen during the World Cup this summer, Alexis is a 
fantastic footballer and we are delighted that he is joining us at 
Arsenal.

He has consistently produced top-quality performances at the highest level for a number of seasons now and we are all excited to see him integrate into the Arsenal squad. I’m sure all Arsenal supporters will join me in welcoming Alexis to our club.'

Sanchez
 will improve Arsenal’s attacking options, which already include Mesut 
Ozil, Santi Cazorla, Lukas Podolski, Olivier Giroud, and Theo Walcott.

Sanchez will be joined at Arsenal by Newcastle right back Mathieu Debuchy, who will arrive in a deal worth £11million.

The
 pair will be expected to help the north London club maintain a title 
challenge this season after a fourth-placed finish last term.

Relief: Arsene Wenger celebrates winning the FA Cup in May and may be celebrating again now

Meanwhile, Mikel 
Arteta, speaking ahead of the club’s official Puma kit launch, said 
Arsenal’s new signings will help them build on May’s FA Cup win over 
Hull.

The Spaniard said: ‘All the top clubs will be strengthening and it is going to get even more difficult.

‘If we start very well again, people 
will say: “Arsenal will tire by February or March”.

'The only thing that 
will change that is if we get to that stage and go through it and win 
it.’

Looking back: Luis Suarez looks poised to move to La Liga to join Barca in a deal worth a £75m

Arteta reiterated his intention to extend his stay at Arsenal.

The midfielder has 12 months left on his current deal and will hold talks once Wenger returns from Brazil next week.

‘I’m really happy here,’ added Arteta.
