The financial crisis has been as devastating for family incomes as a world war, a senior Bank of England official warned yesterday.

It is likely that the costs will still be being paid by our grandchildren, Andrew Haldane added.

He said there was ‘every reason’ for people to feel ‘deeply upset and angry’ about the turmoil inflicted by the crash of 2008 and 2009.

In a sober analysis of the scale of 
the challenge facing Britain Mr Haldane, the Bank’s executive director 
for financial stability, said: ‘If we are fortunate, the cost of the 
crisis will be paid for by our children. More likely it will still be 
being paid for by our grandchildren.

‘In terms of the loss of incomes and outputs, this is as bad as a world war – that’s the scale we’re talking about.’

George Osborne will tomorrow 
acknowledge in his autumn statement that bringing the public finances 
back to order will take significantly longer than the Government had 
anticipated.

The Chancellor is expected to accept 
that debt as a proportion of GDP will not be falling by 2015-2016, one 
of his key fiscal targets.

To meet his main commitment, to 
eliminate the structural deficit, he is expected to have to find more 
than £23billion through further cuts and tax rises by 2017.

Key out-of-work benefits are expected to be frozen and the best-off can expect to lose some of their pension tax breaks.

'Devastating': Andrew Haldane said people had 'every reason' to feel 'deeply upset and angry' about the turmoil inflicted by the crash of 2008 and 2009

The Chancellor is expected to unveil a
series of measures to stimulate economic growth, including 
infrastructure projects backed by £40billion of state guarantees, help 
for smaller businesses that want to export, and a postponement of the 3p
a litre rise in fuel duty to put more money in people’s pockets.

Mr Haldane, making his world war 
comparison, told Radio 4’s the World at One: ‘It would be astonishing if
people weren’t fed up on the street, asking big questions about where 
finance has gone wrong. There is every reason why the general public 
ought to be deeply upset by what has happened and angry.’

In 2008 the then Chancellor, Alistair 
Darling, came under fire from allies of Gordon Brown for saying that the
economic times Britain was facing were ‘arguably the worst they’ve been
in 60 years’ and would be ‘more profound and long-lasting than people 
thought’.

His warning has proved only too 
accurate, according to Mr Haldane, based on the fall in the country’s 
economic output since the recession and in the aftermath of the Second 
World War.

Output has fallen rapidly since the 
recession, with real GDP currently 3.1 per cent below its 2008 peak. By 
comparison, it rebounded fairly sharply after the end of the war.

Mr Haldane said the banking industry 
reached a pivotal moment in June when the scandal about the fixing of 
Libor, a key interest rate, broke after a series of other events such as
the misselling of payment protection insurance.

He said: ‘It was partly that the 
public mistrust of the culture of banking had built up to such a point 
that banking itself said: ‘‘Look, this has gone wrong’’.’

Mr Haldane said he would be 
‘surprised’ if the gold-plated salaries and bonuses enjoyed by City  
executives – which have been a source of huge public anger – did not 
fall further.
