Police on a quest to find the Holy Grail raided a rural pub where they believed it was illegally stashed only to find an informant  got it mixed up with an old salad bowl from the kitchen.

The team of 12 officers and a sniffer dog shut down the Crown in Lea, Herefordshire, because they believed staff were hiding the priceless Nanteos Cup - stolen from a country house nearby.

The wooden chalice is believed to be the vessel Christ drank from at the Last Supper and later used to collect his blood at crucifixion, giving it special healing powers.

The hunt for the Grail consumed King Arthur and his knights and even Indiana Jones. 

But West Mercia Police were forced to join the search for the priceless medieval artefact after it was the only item stolen in a raid at a remote country house in Herefordshire last month.

Weeks after its disappearance police received 'intelligence' it was in the Crown pub, but all they found was wooden bowl used to serve salad to customers.

Landlady Di Franklyn said: 'I was amazed to see so many police - they said they had been given information that this Holy Grail had been shown off by someone here.

'But if somebody had stolen something as priceless as the Holy Grail I don't think it would be on show in my pub.

'But the police were taking the information very seriously because there were so many of them including a police dog handler.'

Crime scene: A dozen officers said they 'received intelligence' the Grail was seen here at the Crown in Lea, Herefordshire and believed staff may have been hiding it after its theft

Court order: Police went to magistrates to get a search warrant and said simply they believed the pub housed the Nanteos Cup

Legend has it that the cup has healing powers and was named after the vessel that Jesus drank out of during the Last Supper.

Staff at the  were not allowed to leave the premises during the search and a policeman stood guard during the early morning raid.

Mrs Franklin, 54, said: 'I have been shown a picture of the missing cup - if it had been here we would have thrown it on the fire because it is not whole any more.

'The only thing here that looks like it is an old salad bowl.'

The cup is said to have been brought to Britain by Joseph of Arimathea, the founder of a religious settlement in Glastonbury during the mediaeval period.

The grail then came into the possession of a group of Somerset monks who later fled with the cup to Strata Florida Abbey, near Tregaron in in Ceredigion.

For centuries the historic cup was kept at Nanteos Mansion in the village of at Rhydfelin near Aberystwyth.

But it was stolen while being cared for by Fiona Mirylees, from Weston-under-Penyard, Herefordshire, whose family once owned the mansion in Wales.

Police said the cup went missing after it had been loaned to a seriously-ill woman because of its healing powers.

When the fragile dark wooden cup was stolen, sometime between Monday July 7 and Monday July 14 - the remaining pieces were not taken.

West Mercia Police officers said the raid was carried out after they 'received intelligence' that the stolen cup had been seen in the pub.

A spokesman said: 'We were told it was still there and so executed a search warrant to try and find it.'

Holy moment: The Grail has been hunted for centuries as it was used by Christ on the eve of his death at the Last Supper, shown her in Leonardo da Vinci's painting 

It is considered the most holy artefact in the Christian world.

The search for the mythical religious artefact, known widely as the Holy Grail, has been hunted for since Jesus' death and even formed the plot for the Hollywood movie Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.

According to legend, the grail may either have been the drinking vessel used at the Last Supper, or used following the crucifixion to gather Christ’s blood.

But many believe it then made it was brought to Britain. 

Some believe it came to Glastonbury in the hands of  Joseph of Arimathea, when he founded an abbey there in the first century. 

Others say Joseph’s brother-in-law, Hebron, the ‘Fisher King’ of Arthurian legend, took the chalice to his son, Alain, in Britain.

From there, the grail myth divides again. While some believe it was taken to Nova Scotia in the 1300s, others believe the Knights Templar became custodians of the grail.

The Nanteos Cup was owned by the Powell family, who lived on the Nanteos estate, outside Aberystwyth, in the 19th century. It was kept behind glass at their Palladian mansion on the estate but in 1870 the vessel was exhibited at St David’s College, Lampeter, at a meeting of the Cambrian Archaeological Society. By then, it already had a reputation for healing. 

The cup was said to have been given to a Major Mirylees, who took it to Herefordshire, after the last of the Powells died in the 1950s.

Despite the Nanteos Cup’s long association with the legend of the Holy Grail, experts have repeatedly concluded that it is a 14th century example of a domestic vessel known as a mazer bowl made of wych elm, not the olive wood expected of a Middle Eastern artefact.
