An £8million artwork by Claude Monet all but destroyed when a man put his fist through it is back on display after a painstaking 18-month restoration.

The impressionist painting was ripped apart in a devastating three branch tear in June 2012 while it hung in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin. A man is awaiting trial over the vandalism.

The tears to the painting from 1874, called Argenteuil Basin With A Single Sailboat, laid end to end would have been about a foot long in an artwork less than four feet square.

Jean-Jacques Goran, managing director of BNP Paribas Foundation, who helped fun the repairs, and Claude Monet Paintings Conservation Fellow, Pearl O'Sullivan, unveil the restored artwork

The varnish that covers the oil paint was also cleaned before the artwork was returned to the gallery giving it a brighter finish more reminiscent of how it originally looked 140 years ago

Monet's painting, the only one in Ireland's national collection, depicts the shifting clouds, rippled water, golden leaves and a gliding yacht which gives a sense of transience

Sean Rainbird, director of the National Gallery of Ireland, likened the meticulous repair to microscopic needlework.

'It was huge damage, shocking damage,' he said.

'This project to restore and conserve one of the gallery's most popular impressionist works of art is testament to the outstanding expertise and dedication of our professional team of conservators.'

The oil painting - the only Monet in 
Ireland's national collection - is relatively small at 55cm by 65cm but 
is regarded as a classic.

It was painted at a time when Monet was using a boat as a floating studio on the Seine to paint scenes of the river and its banks.

It is now being housed behind protective glass - a low reflective, ultraviolet-filtered climate box with a humidity buffer.

Monet painted the scene in his own 
distinctive brushstroke style and contemporary colours in the same year 
that the first impressionist exhibition was held in Paris.

The director of the National Gallery of Ireland said the quality of the restoration was a testament to the 'outstanding expertise and dedication' of those involved in the lengthily project

It depicts the shifting clouds, rippled water, golden leaves and a gliding yacht which gives a sense of transience.

The painting was bequeathed to the Irish state by dramatist and politician Edward Martyn who bought it on the advice of his cousin, the writer George Moore.

The repair work involved gathering hundreds of microscopic fragments of paint which broke off the canvas during the vandalism - most measured 0.3-1mm across.

Seven per cent of the pieces could not be saved, some splitting into powdery dust, too tiny to reattach in the jigsaw restoration.

Conservationists removed the painting from its frame and delicately sewed together thousands of fine threads which made up the canvass.

Under a microscope and using surgical tools and special heaters, they reattached fine materials with a specially formulated adhesive.

The varnish which covers the oil paint was also been cleaned before the artwork returned to the gallery giving it a brighter and fresher feel, closer to what it the original work looked like 140 years ago.

The canvass has been lined across the back to provide additional support.

The restoration was supported by BNP Paribas, with Monet Paintings Conservation Fellow, Pearl O'Sullivan being hired to undertake the work.
