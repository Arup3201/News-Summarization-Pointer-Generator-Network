Tom Daley's Hollywood screenwriter boyfriend has denied he is to be called as a character witness in the sex abuse trial of X-Men director Bryan Singer.

Dustin Lance Black, 39, whose relationship with the 19-year-old Olympic diver was made public in December, was reportedly expected to be named as a witness in lawsuit filed against Singer in the U.S.

The director has been accused of hosting depraved sex parties and raping teenage boys by Michael Egan, 31, who says he was one of Singer's victims when he was 15.

Called up: Dustin Lance Black, pictured right with Tom Daley, is to be called as a character witness in the sex abuse trial

There is no suggestion that Mr Black, who will appear only as a character witness, had any knowledge or was present at the time of the alleged abuse.

But he is reportedly close to Singer, considering him a mentor figure, and has been seen attending a pool party hosted by the director, who has strenuously denied the allegations.

Accusations: Bryan Singer allegedly raped Michael Egan at pool parties in 1999 and 2000

A lawyer for Mr Egan had earlier confirmed the intention to call on Mr Black, telling the Daily Mirror: 'I intend to take ­depositions [statements] of all individuals who may have relevant information, including Singer’s friends.

An unnamed source told the paper: 'Dustin looked up to Singer as he was such an established film director in Hollywood'.

Today, a spokesman for Mr Black said there 'was no truth to reports' that Mr Black was to be called as a character witness.

Mr Daley came out in a touching Youtube video in December, and revealed that Mr Black - an Oscar-winning screenwriter - was his boyfriend a few weeks later.

Speaking about the relationship, Mr Daley said at the time: 'I’d never felt the feeling of love, it happened so quickly, I was completely overwhelmed by it to the point I can’t get him out of my head all the time.'

Mr Egan has sensationally claimed that he caught up in a paedophile sex ring involving Singer and other Hollywood figures when he was a teenager living in California around 1999 and 2000.

Speaking at a press conference last week he spoke of how Singer treated him like 'a piece of meat' and
 he claims he had 'a gun put in my mouth' by Hollywood power broker Mark
 Rector-Collins so he'd do as he was told.

'I
 wouldn't say it was a relationship [with Singer], you were a piece of 
meat,' Egan said of how he was treated at the parties that he allegedly began attending when he was just 14 or 15.

He said: 'Certain situations like at the house 
where the rules were no swimsuits by the pool areas. I was in the hot 
tub with Singer and other individuals, they grope you, shove your head 
under water, orally molest you, then they'd rape you by the side of hot 
tub. You were a piece of meat.'

Details: Michael Egan filed a lawsuit on Wednesday - and held a press conference yesterday claiming Bryan Singer drugged and raped him in California and Hawaii in the late 1990s

He claimed the men regularly threatened to ruin his dreams of becoming an actor if he didn't comply with their demands.

Mr Egan has been dismissed as a fantasist by Singer's representatives. Responding to the allegations, attorney Marty Singer - who is not related to the director - said: 'It is obvious 
that this case was filed in an attempt to get publicity,' ahead of the 
film's release.

'The 
claims made against Bryan Singer are completely without merit. We are 
very confident that Bryan will be vindicated in this absurd and 
defamatory lawsuit.'

'We look forward to our bringing a claim 
for malicious prosecution against Mr. Egan and his attorney after we 
prevail.'
