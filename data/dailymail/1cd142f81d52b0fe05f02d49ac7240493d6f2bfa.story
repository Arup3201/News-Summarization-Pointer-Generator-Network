Accused: Leon Lawrence, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court last year, denies charges of handling stolen goods and attempting to convert criminal property

Artwork by renowned graffiti artist Banksy was ripped from a hotel wall and put up for sale on eBay for £17,000, a court was told.

The work, known as Sperm Alarm and attributed to the famous guerrilla graffiti artist, was allegedly put on the online auction site by Leon Lawrence, 32, after it had been stolen from a wall outside the four-star Hesperia Hotel in central London.

Lawrence is said to have framed the piece, which shows 15 sperm swarming around a red sprinkler alarm, before putting it up for sale on eBay.

He is alleged to have used his eBay account to try and sell the artwork under the name LeonLeon, between February 9 and April 4 2011, Southwark Crown Court heard on Monday.

Staff at the hotel in Victoria contacted police when they saw the original work listed for sale online.

Edward Franklin, prosecuting, told the court how staff had noticed the artwork as soon as it appeared on a wall outside the Hesperia.

'You may have heard of the artist Banksy. He is a graffiti artist and he appears to have graffitied a panel of wall belonging to the Hesperia Hotel, by Victoria station,' he said.

'Staff realised it was there, and they also realised when someone had come along and taken their panel.

'That piece of panel, with Banksy's design on it, dubbed the 'Sperm Alarm', was later put for sale on eBay and they contacted the police,' Mr Franklin said.

'The seller on eBay was registered as LeonLeon, and by working out who that person was Mr Lawrence entered into their investigation.

'He was trying to sell this stolen art.'

Mr Franklin said it was the Crown's case that Mr Lawrence knew or believed the piece he was trying to sell was stolen.

'He did not manage to sell the item,' he added.

The jury at Southwark Crown Court was told police officers found images of the artwork on Lawrence's laptop.

Mr
Franklin said officers found a picture of the panel featuring the 
artwork, as well as a picture of the space left when the panel was 
removed from the hotel wall.

Now you see it: The artwork, which has been attributed to famous guerilla graffiti artist Banksy, appeared on a wall outside London's Hesperia Hotel

Now you don't: Hesperia staff contacted police when the artwork disappeared and later appeared on eBay with a price tag of £17,000

A picture showing the piece in the process of being framed was also found on the computer, he told the court.

'Also found were web pages of the auction site, where it would appear he (Lawrence) tried to sell the art work for £17,000,' Mr Franklin said.

High-profile art collectors have forked out huge sums to own a Banksy original. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie spent £1 million on works by the elusive street artist in 2007.

Lawrence, of Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, denies charges of handling stolen goods and attempting to convert criminal property.

The trial continues.
