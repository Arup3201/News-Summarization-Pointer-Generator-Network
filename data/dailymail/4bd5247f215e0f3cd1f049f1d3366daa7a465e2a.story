Celebrity chef Jimmy Garcia is convinced you can feed a family of four two courses for £9.58 - and he promises the meals are of restaurant quality 

Jimmy explains that post-Christmas blues and long dark days can leave us all longing for a treat, such as his 'gorgeous pork'.

'Pork is such a cheap meat but it's really in vogue and you'll find it in all the cool gastro pubs.' 

According to Jimmy, the costings are specific to the measurements used in the recipe and have been calculated using prices taken from mysupermarket.co.uk (as of 16 January, 2015) or via the supermarkets direct (Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose, Morrisons).

Where prices differ across supermarkets for the same ingredient an average cost was apparently used.

1 celery stick, roughly chopped into large chunks

3 dried apricots

1 cup water

Salt and black pepper

Juice and zest of 1 orange, (reserve the zest for the chocolate mousse)

2 Pears, peeled and sliced

Splash of vinegar

1 tsp cornflour (optional)

For the winter vegetable salad

2 pears

1 bag of salad, whichever variety you prefer

1 carrot, cut in to ribbons with a vegetable peeler

1 cooked beetroot, cut into chunky cubes

1 sweet potato peeled and cut into chunks

½ bag radishes – approximately 7 cut in half

Method

Preheat the oven to 180C for 2 ½ hours

For the pork belly, take a bowl and mix the honey, mustard and apricot jam together and pour over the pork belly. Marinate the pork belly in the honey mix for as long as possible - two hours will do - then wrap in cling film and place in the fridge for better results.

Put all the vegetables in the bottom of the roasting tray, place the pork belly on top of the vegetables and add water until it almost touches the bottom of the meat. Place in the oven at 180C for about 2 ½ hours.

Place the sweet potato onto a tray and drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper and bake for about 20 minutes at 180C. Put to one side for the salad.

After 2 ½ hours, remove the lid and place the pork onto a tray and back into the oven. Turn up the heat to 230C and cook for a further 30 minutes to get a lovely crispy crackling.

Meanwhile make the sauce vinaigrette by removing all the juices from the roasting tray and skimming off the fat. A good way of doing this is by placing the liquid into a tupperware and then into the freezer for about 15-20 minutes – this will allow the fat to freeze and it will mean that you can scrape the fat easily from the top leaving you with the base for your sauce.

Place the liquid into a saucepan and add the juice of the orange and a splash of vinegar if you have some. Add the sliced pears to the liquor and allow it to reduce over a medium heat for about 20 minutes. 

Once the pears are soft remove from the sauce and add a little corn flour to thicken if necessary. For the salad, place the leaves onto a serving plate and scatter over the carrot, beetroot, sweet potato, sliced pears and radish before drizzling over a little of the sauce.

For pudding Jimmy whips up a chocolate orange mousse and says you can add chocloate you have lying around your cupboards to the top

Jimmy Garcia's chocolate orange mousse

Ingredients

4 eggs

1 bar dark chocolate (approx. 100g -112g)

Zest of 1 orange

Method

Separate the eggs into two bowls. Take the egg whites and set the electric whisk to a slow speed and whisk until foamy - you are looking for soft peaks or until they have roughly reached twice their volume.

Melt the chocolate over a Bain Marie – a bowl placed over a saucepan with boiling water. Make sure the base of the bowl is not touching the water. Once the chocolate has melted remove the bowl from the Bain Marie and add the egg yolks and combine.

Gently fold the melted chocolate in to the egg whites and combine together. Stir through the orange zest and then place the mixture into a glass or ramekin to set for approximately 2 hours or overnight if you can.
