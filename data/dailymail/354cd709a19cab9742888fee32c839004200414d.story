Ellen Burkhardt, from Minnesota, has created a buzz on social media about her decision to stay a virgin until after she is married 

In the piece Burkhardt says she finds it difficult to explain to men she is dating that she will not have sex until after marriage, but she is planning to stick to her decision.

'I should be better at sharing this bit of information by now. I'm a 26-year-old woman with a college degree, a good job, an adorable duplex and no debt. 

'I have a solid group of friends, a supportive family and a clear awareness of who I am and who I want to be. 

'By most accounts, I am a successful human being. Yet the moment I have to tell the guy I'm dating that sex is not an option, I become a squirmy, awkward, fidgety girl who can't make eye contact or put together a complete sentence.'

In the article Burkhardt talks about being a Christian

Burkhardt, declares she is a 'Christian. Not a Bible-thumping, the-world-is-going-to-hell-in-a-handbasket Christian, but a (sexually) conservative, Bible-believing, traditionally raised Minnesota Lutheran girl who was taught that sex is for marriage and that's that.'

Burkhardt details her previous relationships in which the boys have either lost interest immediately or end it with her a few months down the line. 

She says a man she titles as 'Boy One' fell into the 'celibacy-then-bail category' and it ended with a drunken row about her choice. 

Another relationship 'Boy Two' was simply a rebound and Burkhardt admits she told him she did not see them going in the direction of marriage so sex was not an issue and they finished.

But she says 'Boy Three' who worked at her church was a devout and serious Christian, but he pressured her until she felt outside her 'comfort zone', and would throw a tantrium because she would not relent. 

Burkhardt insists her decision has not made her unhappy, but instead says: 'I've come to realize that of all the experiences and opportunities offered in life, to love someone is the most precious.'

After her article started gaining traction on social media Burkhardt gave an interview to CBS Local about its response. 

'Clearly I've hit a nerve, and maybe more people feel the way I do, then we realize and they've just been too intimidated to share that perspective,' she said.

Burkhardt said: 'Clearly I've hit a nerve, and maybe more people feel the way I do, then we realize'

She said she wants her article to help other people who are in the minority too.  

'Take the time to really find out who you are, what you want. 

'Once you figure that out, just stick to it,' she said. 

'For me, it's not having sex until I'm in love and married.'

Social media was hugely supportive of Burkhardt's confessional piece, with many claiming to have been inspired by her honesty.

On Twitter, user @Bre wrote that 'We need more people like Ellen Burkhardt in this world...she's just telling her story without judging others.'

In an article posted to her blog, Deadreamer, writer, Sarah Lampkin said that she didn't feel so isolated now that Burkhardt had penned her article.

'Being a vigin can feel like a bad thing in our society,' wrote Lampkin.

'It feels as though we are mocked for our virginity.'

'But after reading Ellen's article, I have some hope......I do hope you go and read her article. It is inspiring and helps give me a small peace of mind.'
