Phil Neville has revealed how the Old Trafford lap of honour after Tuesday’s 3-1 win over Hull City was the emptiest moment of his career. 

Neville could not hide his pain as he spoke about the traumas of a season that reduced England’s most successful club to an object of fun.

‘It’s been a real difficult season,’ said Neville. ‘A club that should be challenging for league titles to  finish seventh is obviously not good enough. And to see a man who, for the last eight years, has put so much confidence in me — to see him lose his job was probably one of the toughest days I’ve had in football.

‘Walking around the pitch after the Hull game was probably the emptiest I’ve ever felt on a football field. I took the job expecting to be walking around the last home game of the season either challenging for a league title or parading a league title. That’s what this club demands and we’ve got to make sure next season we are doing that.’

It has been the fall of Moyes that has particularly stung Neville. ‘He has taken the majority of criticism from outside the club, but if you speak to anyone inside then we’ve all got to take collective responsibility — from players, the staff, the coaching staff, everybody,’ said Neville.

‘It was really disappointing when David lost his job because I class him as a friend. As a player, I’ve never experienced anything like that with a manager — maybe once with Kevin Keegan at England, when he lost his job.

‘The thing we’ve all collectively failed on is definitely that we have lost eight games (in all competitions) at Old Trafford this season. That is not acceptable.

‘If we played all our games away, then we’d be champions. But we’ve lost games at Old Trafford against teams that we should be beating. That has been the biggest single failing.’

Neville’s future, and that of the rest of the Class of ’92 — Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes — is uncertain pending Van Gaal’s arrival after Sunday’s final game of the season against Southampton but Neville is keen to stay on.

‘I don’t know what’s around the corner for me in terms of my own personal job,’ said Neville.

‘But the season as a whole has just not been good enough. We’ve got to make sure next season, whoever is in charge and whoever is coaching, that we get back challenging for league titles.

‘I want to be part of United’s future, I’m a Manchester United person, I love the club.

‘Results aside, it’s been an incredible learning experience at a club that I love. I want to be here for the rest of my life, being involved with United. So that’s my hope.’
