The body of an American woman in her 20s traveling alone in Thailand and missing for five days was found over the weekend in a national park, apparently trampled by elephants.

Lily Glidden's body was so badly damaged that authorities immediately came to the startling conclusion after finding her January 18 following a manhunt that brought in 70 people.

She was found in Kaeng Krachan National Park, a preserve famous for its elephants, and authorities believe she was photographing them when she was killed.

Remote: Kaeng Krachan is Thailand's largest national forest and is well known for its elephants but attacks are rare

Park rangers announced Thursday they'd found the body in the park outside Bangkok.

Glidden was found crumpled in the woods after the search team was deployed.

'Her arms, her wrists and other parts of the body were broken, so we assumed she was trampled by elephants because no humans could have caused such powerful damage to the body,' said police Col. Woradet Suanklaai.

Police sent the body to a forensic institute in the capital to determine the cause of death, he said.

The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok confirmed the death, but gave no details.

Kaeng Krachan is the largest national park in Thailand, covering nearly 32,300 square feet of forest. It is 124 miles southwest of Bangkok.

Woradet said the Glidden was alone when she left a camping ground in the park.

'Looking at the pictures she took in her camera, we see a lot of animals, birds, snakes, lizards,' Woradet said. 'We assumed she wanted to take pictures of elephants because that's what the Kaeng Krachan National Park is famous for. We believed she wanted to find them and take some photos.'
