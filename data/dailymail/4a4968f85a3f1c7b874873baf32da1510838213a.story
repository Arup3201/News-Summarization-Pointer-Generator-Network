For anyone in the public eye, having pearly white teeth has fast become an essential part of a successful celebrity look.

TV mogul Simon Cowell, actress Nicole Kidman and singer Cheryl Cole have all confessed to having their teeth polished in the past to ensure they can flash a Hollywood smile.

But with cosmetic dentistry treatment costing up to £800 a time, cleaning up discoloured teeth is often out of reach of ordinary folk.

However, all that is about to change after Boots announced they were bringing an affordable, DIY home kit which claims to provide professional standard whitening to the High Street for the first time.

The store say they have been inundated with pre-order enquiries for Luster Pro Light – a best-seller in America -  which professes to make teeth up to six shades whiter in just 30 minutes.

At £49.99 the kit costs a fraction of cosmetic dentistry, but uses similar laser light technology for professional results.

In clinical trials on 240 people, 86 per cent said their teeth were noticeably whiter within 30 minutes. One in eight said their teeth were 50 per cent cleaner after just three uses.

Unlike other home whitening kits, which rely on teeth trays and whitening strips that can be fiddly and result in uneven bleaching, Luster Pro is the first ever home kit to use the same paint-on bleach and 'blue light' technology favoured by cosmetic dentists.

Tried and tested: Denise Silvester, 46, from Bromley, said the product worked for her

Users simply paint the gel, which is a non-peroxide bleach, onto their teeth, before pointing a special 'light gun' at them for two minutes. This heats up the gel to between 30C and 50C and speeds up the whitening process.

Manufacturers say the treatment is kinder to gums and eliminates soreness which can sometimes be experienced by users of regular home whitening products.

They say the treatment needs to repeated 10 times for the best results.

Denise Silvester, 46, from Bromley, Kent, who took part in a trial of Luster Pro, said: 'I've always wanted whiter teeth but I could never justify the price.  

'I've tried many whitening toothpastes and systems on the market but nothing really gave me significant results.

'But with the Luster kit the results are incredible. After 30 minutes my teeth were significantly whiter and two weeks on the results are amazing - I would recommend to anyone.'

It is due to go on sale in larger Boots stores and online later this month.
