David Cameron will today try to shame other EU leaders into doing more to tackle Ebola after warning they need to ‘wake up’ to the crisis posed by the killer disease.

The Prime Minister is expected to use a European Council leaders’ summit in Brussels to step up pressure on them to increase their contributions to fighting the outbreak.

Mr Cameron, who has challenged EU member states to provide a total of 1 billion euros (£790m) and 2,000 medical workers to tackle the outbreak, will point out how Britain’s giving has so far dwarfed that of other countries.

A Government source said: ‘We are very much out in front in Europe on this and leading the way. We have pledged £125m (156m euros), which is 40million euros ahead of the next highest country, Germany, in aid.

‘It is four times more than France has pledged to date and 50 times more than Spain, which has obviously had cases in Madrid.’

Following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg in Monday, it is thought that around 750 million euros (£593m) and around 1,000 personnel may be on the table today, but Mr Cameron will push for more cash, healthcare workers and equipment to assist Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, the three countries at the centre of the epidemic.

‘We are very clear that countries around the world need to recognise that by investing now to do more in the region, we help to protect ourselves from greater risk in the future,’ the source added.

‘If all 28 countries turned up at the Council and committed to do more, that would be quite a lot in terms of the three affected countries in the region.’

Mr Cameron will also use the summit to make clear that Britain regards the European Parliament's demand for a budget of 146.4 billion euros (£115.8billion) in 2015 - as well as extra top-up cash to cover overspending in 2014 - as unacceptable.

EU leaders agreed at a previous summit that next year's budget should be no more than 140 billion euros (£110.7billion), and the Government source said that the MEPs' bid was ‘unrealistic’.

‘Clearly we think that what the European Parliament are looking for is unrealistic in the current situation, at a time when families across the continent are dealing with the impact of the great recession,’ said the source.

‘We think they should be looking more ruthlessly at how they prioritise spending.’

Mr Cameron will also seek the support of all 28 member-states for the position on Ukraine taken by him and three other EU leaders in Milan last week, when they told Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that Europe wants to see the implementation of last month's Minsk peace agreement, including more action by Moscow to prevent the flow of weapons across the border.

Speaking about Ebola at the EU-Asia summit in Milan last week, Mr Cameron said: ‘This is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation.

‘Britain in my view has been leading the way. The action we’re taking in Sierra Leone, where we are committing well over £100million, 750 troops, we are going to be training 800 members of health staff in Sierra Leone, providing 700 beds.

‘We are doing a huge amount and I think it’s time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what Britain is doing in Sierra Leone, America’s doing in Liberia, France is doing in Guinea.

‘Other countries now need to step forward with the resources and the action Because taking action at source in west Africa, that is the best way to protect all of us here in Europe.’
