Mitt Romney has used a social media platform to share pictures of a recent family vacation he and his wife Ann took with five of their 22 grandchildren.

The Romney clan undertook what the former presidential candidate describes as a 'family tradition' of hiking through the American West.

'My Mom and Dad began the tradition, showing their grandchildren the majesty of our country and teaching them about the sacrifices and character of the pioneers,' Romney wrote.

Adventurous: The family hiked 50 miles on their educational trip through the American West

Along the way, he says, the Romneys taught their newest members a bit about their ancestry and their ties to the settlement of the American West, Romney wrote on Medium.

However, the Romneys got more than they bargained for, Mitt Romney writes in the short entry, with a close encounter with a a rattle snake and some 'unexpected obstacles.'

As the millionaire Mormon posted his family's bonding adventure, a new poll placed him ahead of President Obama in a hypothetical re-run of the 2012 election.

Romney is clearly enjoying his family life and the two-time presidential candidate has consistently stated that he is not considering a third run.

Imparting wisdom: Romney wanted to show his grandchildren the 'majesty of our country' and teach them about 'the sacrifices and character of the pioneers'

Family time: Romney has consistently denied he'll run in 2016, although a recent poll showed he'd win if the 2012 elections were held today

According to the CNN/ORC International poll, the businessman would take 53 per cent of the popular vote to Obama's 44 per cent.

But he'd lose to Hillary Clinton by 13 points, the poll found.

Now, with the primaries less than a year-and-a-half away, Romney's name is still being bandied about and there's evidence that he still has a loyal following in some parts of the country.

And Romney himself showed politics are never far from his mind.

As he and his grandchildren enjoyed such imaginatively named sites as Goblin Valley, Spooky Gulch, Peekaboo Slot Canyon and Rainbow Arch, the sobering events in the Ukraine and Israel were brought into perspective.

'As we experienced the grandeur of the West, our hearts went out to those millions in the world who suffer.'
