Stephen Lawrence's mother fears Scotland Yard is 'winding down' the hunt for her son's other killers after it emerged the detective who led the murder inquiry is being forced to step down.

Doreen Lawrence has admitted she is 'furious' that Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll is to hand 
over the job he has held for eight years.

The 61-year-old, who became a life peer last year, has demanded a meeting with Metropolitan Police 
Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe to discuss her concerns over the 
future of the investigation.

Worried: Doreen Lawrence is worried Scotland Yard is 'winding down' the hunt for her son's Stephen's other killers

The Met said today that Mr Driscoll had after 30 years reached his 'natural retirement' but the officer said that the decision was made by those above his head.

'I'm absolutely furious Clive is being taken off the investigation,' Baroness Lawrence told the Daily Mirror.

'It seems the clearest sign yet that the Met is planning on winding down the investigation and that is wrong.

'He is the first officer I have trusted and the only one to have delivered in the investigation.'

Talks: Mrs Lawrence has demanded a meeting with Metropolitan Police Chief Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe as she wants reassurances that the investigation into her son's death is not being shut down

Mr
 Driscoll, who in 2012 helped secure the convictions of two men for the 
attack, told the newspaper: 'The decision has been made above me and I 
will always help Stephen's family and friends if I can.'

A spokesman 
for Scotland Yard said Mr Driscoll was among a number of detectives on 
the case who had served for three decades and had reached 'natural 
retirement'. 

A-level student Stephen Lawrence, an 18-year-old aspiring architect, was 
stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked 
racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Well Hall Road, Eltham, 
south-east London, with a friend on April 22 1993.

Police bungled the initial probe and it was nearly 19 years before the Lawrence family had the satisfaction of seeing some of his killers jailed.

A public inquiry found ‘institutionalised’ racism within the Metropolitan Police was one of the primary causes of their failure to solve the case.

Two of the original five prime suspects named by the Daily Mail in 1997 as being Stephen’s killers - Gary Dobson, 38, and David Norris, 37 - were convicted of his murder in 2012 after a belated forensic breakthrough in the case.

But the other three young men accused of his murder - Neil and Jamie Acourt, and their friend, Luke Knight - remain on the streets.

Bernard Hogan-Howe said they should not 'rest easy in bed', but Mrs Lawrence will demand to know if this has changed.

Guilty: Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris went
 on trial for the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 2011 and having denied the charge were found guilty in January 2012

A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: 'DCI Driscoll is due to retire later this year.

'The
 MPS has a dedicated team of detectives that continues to investigate 
the murder of Stephen Lawrence to bring any remaining offenders to 
justice.

'A number of these detectives have exceeded their 30 years 
police service and are due for natural retirement. As part of our 
succession planning and to provide resilience, new officers will join 
the team in early 2014 and replace those due for retirement.'
