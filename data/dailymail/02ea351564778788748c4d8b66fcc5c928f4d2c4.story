When suffering a mid-life crisis, most men consider buying a sports car or signing up for the gym.

But married IT consultant Ian Penfold, 50, decided instead to act out his life long dream - headlining his own rock concert.

The father-of-two, from Wokingham in Berkshire, spent £26,000 on the gig at the Hammersmith Apollo so he could perform in front of 2,000 friends with his band, Hidden Agenda, to mark his 50th birthday.

Star: The father-of-two spent £26,000 renting out the venue and setting it up for the gig for his 50th birthday

The goal was to follow in the 
footsteps of global names who have played there before, such as Bob 
Dylan, Eric Clapton, Iron Maiden and Blondie.

However,
 it was a daunting task for Mr Penfold, who, with his disco tribute act,
 normally plays in front of a feeble crowd of around 100 people.

He spent two years planning and organising the event and faced the prospect of a huge financial loss if his dream failed.

It
 costs £12,000 to hire the venue and, on top of this, Mr Penfold and 
Hidden Agenda would have to pay for all of the lighting, sound and cost 
of publicising the event.

This
 came to more than £26,000. Despite never having done anything like this
 before, the band managed to sell more than 1,600 tickets at £18 each 
before giving around 400 to charities to give away.

His name in lights: Mr Penfold said there was a 'huge build-up', but he was relaxed when it came to the performance itself

Mr Penfold, from Wokingham, Berkshire, played bass guitar at the gig, which took place last weekend.

He said: 'My 50th birthday was on the horizon and I wanted to do something special, and slightly silly.

'So in May 2012 I approached the Apollo and they were super helpful.

'I asked the manager if anyone had done this before and he just gave me a look, but I saw this as a challenge and it spurred me on.

Preparation: Mr Penfold, who lives in Wokingham, Berkshire, spent two years planning the concert

'When you hire out the Apollo, you 
simply get an empty room. You have to sort out the sound, the lighting, 
the tickets and promotion. It took over mine and my wife Janet’s lives.

'I
 didn’t have £26,000 to lose so it was a big risk but we took a leap of 
faith and managed to break even which was a real achievement.'

After the warm-up acts, Me Penfold and the rest of Hidden Agenda went out onto stage to perform in front of the 2,000 spectators.

Miffy Scally and Alana Warner were the singers, Angela Neil was on sax, Patrick Moore on guitar, Rob Hodgkinson on keyboards, Colin Bibby on drums and Ian on bass.

They opened up with ‘Rock That’, by Earth, Wind and Fire and played classics like ‘Car Wash’ by Rose Royce and ‘Superstition’ by Stevie Wonder.

The gig finished with a standing ovation as the group thrashed out ‘Hot Stuff’ by Donna Summer.

He added: 'It was very enjoyable and more relaxing than expected. It all came along and there were more than 2,000 people watch.

'Seeing my name in lights outside was really special. Strangely, when it got to the performance I was really relaxed about it.

'There was a huge build-up but it ended up going really well. Everyone was up on their feet dancing.

'The
 biggest thing was the organisation, going out there and performing felt
 like the easy thing. I went out on stage and the crowd sang Happy 
Birthday and then I played.

'It was a fantastic feeling, although I’m not sure I’d do it again too soon.'
