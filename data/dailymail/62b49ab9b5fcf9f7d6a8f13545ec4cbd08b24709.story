Senior Italian officials and ten mafia bosses appeared in court yesterday accused of making deals to stop mob murders in the 1990s.

It was held in a secret bunker court house near Palermo, reported The Daily telegraph.

Former interior minister Nicola Mancino and Marcello Dell’Utri, an aid to Silvio Berlusconi, have been charged.

They went to court alongside the jailed Cosa Nostra boss, Toto Riina.

There are 1,788 witnesses expected to give evidence, including Italian president Giorgio Napolitano.

Former mob boss Salvatore Toto Riina has also been charged with the offence

It is alleged that politicians arranged for negotiations between Mafia bosses and the police to halt a series of bombings in mainland Italy.

They were also attempting to stop the murder of two anti-Mafia magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borselino in 1992.

In return, the Mafia sought relaxed prison sentences for jailed Mafia members.

Also accused is a former official with the Carabinieri parliamentary office, Mario Mori, who was allegedly a go-between for the police. 

Mafia informant Gaspare Spatuzza slaimed that Mr Berlusconi had discussed a halt to the bombings with the mafia before he entered politics.

Mr Dell’Utri also awaits the final verdict one a separate conviction related to ties with the Mafia.

He has worked for Mr Berlusconi since the 1970s and it is claimed he was an intermediary between him and the Mafia.

Mr Manciono said that he should not be tried alongside Mafia members: ‘I have always fought the Mafia, I cannot stay in the same trial where there are Mafioso.’

This year is the 20th anniversary of the attack on Florence in 1993.

It has been alleged that Silvio Berlusconi entered into negotiations with the Mafia before he entered politics

The trial was held in Palermo, where some of the murders where reported to have been planned
