Xabi Alonso is on the verge of joining Bayern Munich from Real Madrid for around £5million. 

The Spanish midfielder who announced his international retirement on Wednesday had been linked with a return to the Premier League in the past with Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea a possible destination.

He was even understood to be on Manchester United’s radar although his text message to Angel Di Maria this week wishing him ‘good luck even thought it’s United’ seemed to confirm that was not going to be possible.

Now it seems he has opted for the Bundesliga instead with Pep Guardiola – so often one of his 'Clasico' enemies in Spain – as his new coach.

Real Madrid had expected to sell Sami Khedira this summer but his excessive wage demands put off Arsenal and now it seems Alonso who will be 33 in November will leave instead.

After a long-term injury to Bayern Munich midfielder Javi Martinez the German champions have been on the lookout for a replacement and although chairman Karl-Heinze Rummenigge favoured the younger Khedira Guardiola has insisted on Alonso.

Alonso's move could be sealed on Thursday with the former Liverpool midfielder who has won the European Cup twice earning around £150,000-a-week in a two-year deal.
