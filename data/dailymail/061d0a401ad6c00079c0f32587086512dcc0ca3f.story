Lava from Hawaii's Kilauea volcano continues to move slowly through a vacant lot in a rural subdivision.

Hawaii County spokesman Kevin Dayton says it looks like the lava will bypass homes in the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision.

He says that as of Tuesday, the lava is about 19 days from reaching Pahoa Village Road.

Hawaii County spokesman Kevin Dayton said the slow-moving lava is expected to bypass homes in the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision, and the lava is about 5 days from reaching Pahoa Village Road

The road is the main drag though Pahoa Village and from there, it could reach Highway 130. The highway is a lifeline for residents living on the Big Island's Puna district.

Workers continue to prepare unpaved roads to be used as alternate routes in case lava crosses the highway.

The lava has slowed in recent days. Hawaii County Civil Defense says it advanced 270 yards since Monday. The flow is about 100 yards wide.

 Hawaiian Volcano Observatory scientists say the lava has moved an average of about 890 feet a day since Monday, slightly higher than the rate of about 705 feet a day between Friday and Sunday

According to today's report from the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, the flow continues to advance northeast through thick forest, moving at an average of 890 feet a day in the last three days, traveling 11.3 miles from the vent.

Smoke billows from where the lava 'engulfs trees and other vegetation,' the report notes, though fires are fortunately not spreading away from the flow. Scientists predict it could cross Pāhoa Village Road, fewer than 2.7 miles away, as early as September 24, and then move onto block Hwy. 130.

But unpredictability is part of the problem: The flow emerged June 27, but went underground for quite a while before returning to the surface in late August, with several disappearances and re-emergences since then. 

The direction and speed of the flow have also shifted slightly — though not for the better — since scientists began monitoring it.

Kilauea has been erupting continuously since 1983. Scientists issued a warning last week when a lava flow that has been advancing through cracks in the earth for the past few months moved to within a mile of a rural subdivision.

The flow since has slowed, but the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said it could reach the northwest edge of Kaohe Homesteads in a day-and-a-half. The county hasn't ordered any evacuations, however.

Officials also are preparing for the possibility that the lava will cross Highway 130, which links Pahoa and the sprawling, mostly rural district of Puna to Hilo. This could happen within weeks.

Hawaii County Civil Defense Director Darryl Oliveira said lava has covered other major Big Island roads in the past, like a state highway in Kalapana and Chain of Craters Road which is partially in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.

The part of Highway 130 that could be cut off is used by 7,000 to 11,000 vehicles per day, he said.

The county is quickly trying to prepare alternate routes for people to use

Those who live on the slopes of Kilauea volcano know lava could start creeping their way at any time but the area is still a powerful draw for many who value its community and affordability

Lava flow from the Kilauea volcano is approaching the boundary of the Kaohe Homesteads division on the Big Island of Hawaii. Hawaii has declared a state of emergency with lava  now less than 1.6 km from houses

A vent on the volcano began oozing lava on 27 June 2014, moving downhill at up to 240 meter per day

The flow emerged from a vent at Kilauea's Puu Oo crater in late June. Since then, it has traveled nearly 9 miles as the crow flies, or just over 10 miles if its twists and turns are accounted for.

The lava is creeping through thick forest, setting alight trees and generating smoke plumes. It is visible only from the air, unlike previous flows that tourists could watch drop into the ocean from coastal viewing areas.
