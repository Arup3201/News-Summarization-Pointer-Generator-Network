One of the men shot and killed by a 14-year-old boy during a deer-hunting trip in northeastern Oregon was the teenager's foster father, authorities revealed today.

The boy, who has not been named because of his age, allegedly shot his foster father Michael Piete, 43, and Kenneth C. Gilliland, 64, at midnight on Wednesday.

A hunting rifle and a revolver were used in the incident and one of the men was shot inside their cabin while the other was shot outside, Grant County Sheriff Glenn Palmer said.

Killed: Michael Piete, 43, has allegedly been shot dead by his foster son as they took a deer hunting trip in northeastern Oregon. The boy, who is 14, also shot dead another man before trying to flee

After the shootings, he fled the cabin but accidentally shot himself in the leg. He returned to the cabin to pleading for help, but another member of the hunting party inside tied him up with duct tape and held him at gunpoint.

While he was being watched, another man, who owns the cabin just outside the Umatilla National Forest, drove about nine miles to the town of Granite, where he woke someone who called for help.

Deputies arrived at the cabin and found the boy taped to a chair.

The teenager was taken by ambulance to a 
hospital in Baker City then flown with a state police trooper to St. 
Alphonsus Hospital in Boise.

Scene: One of the men was shot inside the cabin, pictured, while one was shot outside. When the boy tried to flee, he accidentally shot himself and when he returned for help, other hunters held him at gunpoint

He is expected to recover from the injury, police said, but a hospital official refused to confirm he 
was there or give his condition.

District Attorney Ryan Joslin has not said whether the boy would be charged and officers would not say whether a motive had been established.

The group, all from Baker City, Oregon, had been on a deer hunting trip at the cabin on private property in Oregon's Blue Mountains.

Mr Piete, who appears to have a large family in his Facebook photographs, is seen enjoying fishing, hunting and the outdoors on his social networking profile.

The group were staying in a cabin in Oregon's Blue Mountains when the incident happened. The 14-year-old boy received treatment in hospital, but it is not known whether he has been charged
