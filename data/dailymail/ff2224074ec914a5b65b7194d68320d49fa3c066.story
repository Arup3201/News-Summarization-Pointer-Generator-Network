Giving a nod to Mitt Romney’s heavy defeat on Tuesday, Saturday Night Live began their weekly show with the defeated Massachusetts governor drowning his sorrows – with milk.

Jason Sudeikis reprised his role as Romney during the cold open, sneaking dairy products on the back of his expansive balcony. ‘Darn it all to heck,’ he began.

Numerous members of his family – including Kate McKinnon as his wife Ann and Taran Killam as his sons Tag, Matt, and Josh – came outside to try and comfort him, to no avail. Killam as Tag said that his father’s loss made him want to ‘punch America in the face.’

Does the body good: Sudeikis drowned his sorrow in milk, one hidden in the shrubs and another in his shoe; Romney was pictured with a gallon of chocolate milk following his loss

SNL took it aim on the Republican presidential candidate, after he lost the Electoral College vote tally 332 to 206 in Tuesday’s election. In the skit, Romney’s family was throwing a dignified post-election soiree, but Sudeikis had retired to the balcony to chug Vitamin D milk.

Romney himself was pictured with a gallon of chocolate milk following the disappointing loss.

Sudeikis’ son, Killam as Tag Romney, came out to ask what more he wanted to accomplish. ‘I have so much I want to do,’ Sudeikis said. ‘I want to find out how mayonnaise is made.’

After ‘cracking open’ another carton of milk, Killam as Matt comes out, begging his father to come into the house. ‘Paul Ryan is doing feats of strength in the living room,’ he said.

Sudeikis responded with vitriol. ‘I would’ve liked to see him carry Wisconsin.’

A concerned Killam then asked, ‘Have you been drinking? You smell like a dairy.’ Sudeikis offers his son a drink, but Killam sounds horrified. ‘I’m only 38!’ he said.

A third son, Josh, tries to entice his father into the party. ‘Donald Trump is doing a very amusing thing where he’s racist,’ Killam said.

My way or the highway: Jay Pharoah again played Obama, saying that he was not going to let anything stand in his way during his second term

Four more years: Pharoah said he was a little surprised at the election outcome, saying Republicans had his defeat in the bag - high unemployment, high gas prices, and a bad first debate performance to boot

But it’s not until McKinnon comes out again that Sudeikis really gets fired up. He kisses her on the lips, causing McKinnon to say in shock: ‘My, oh my, what has gotten into you?’

Sudeikis responds: ‘Oh, I don’t know, about 10 gallons of milk.’

On Weekend Update, Seth Meyers celebrated ‘four...more…years…of gridlock,’ showing pictures of Republicans Nancy Pelosi and John Boehner.

Noting how the president won many unemployed and student voters, Meyers noted: ‘Basically, Obama became president the same way Budweiser became the king of beer.’

Meyers also commented on the David Petraeus scandal, noting the name of biographer Paula Broadwell’s biography on him, entitled ‘All In.’

‘When they first started working on the book,’ Meyers said, ‘it was called “Just The Tip.”’

Meyers was joined by Jay Pharoah, playing the newly re-elected President Obama. Asked if he was surprised by the result, Pharoah responded: ‘A little. Come on Republicans, what happened? This was yours to win!

Brokeback Maine-ton: Bill Hader, left, and Fred Armisen, right, played a gay couple from Maine dressed in fisherman's sweaters, wool caps, and waders

Angry: Bobby Moynihan played a drunk uncle on Weekend Update, bemoaning the fact that he never graduated from Electoral College

‘Five-dollar gas, eight percent unemployment, I even gave you a first-debate head start!  nd on top of that, I’m Black.’

But Pharoah said that as a second-term president, he wasn’t going to concede to those who were against him. ‘Look out!’ he said. ‘From here on out, we do it my way! Republicans don’t want to talk of immigration? Fine. Meanwhile, a gay Hispanic woman is born every 15 seconds.’

Speaking of what has traditionally been a bipartisan dead end between him and Boehner, he said: ‘Fine, you wanna be unreasonable, fine let’s be unreasonable. The military? Gone! If you want to go to war with Iran, you have to send in Ted Nugent.’

The ‘president’ seemed to be energized, and kept bouncing his shoulders. When Meyers commented, Pharoah responded: ‘Seth, I’m in a good place.

'I want to thank Mitt Romney. Governor, I admire your tenacity, even though watching you run for president was like watching someone in roller skates trying to climb stairs.’

Leading lady: This week's episode was hosted by Anne Hathaway, who plays Fantine in the upcoming film adaptation of Les Miserables

Though he said he was glad for four more years in office, Pharoah’s closing remarks were over how awful his job is. ‘Mainly, this is a terrible job and I hate it,’ he said.

Also appearing on Weekend Update were a gay couple from Maine, which just passed a gay marriage law, and a drunk uncle to talk about the election recount.

Anne Hathaway, who plays Fantine in the upcoming movie version of Les Miserables, hosted for a third time, and Rihanna was the musical guest.
