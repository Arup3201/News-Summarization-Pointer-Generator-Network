Neill Buchel was drunkenly murdered by friends after getting him to drunkenly perform humiliating ‘Jackass-style stunts’ - including rubbing chilli into his privates

Two men who murdered a friend after getting him to drunkenly perform humiliating ‘Jackass-style stunts’ - including rubbing chilli into his privates - are facing life behind bars.

Neill Buchel, 39, was beaten to death by Elvis Kwiatkowski, 36, and Chas Quye, 36, before his body was hacked into ten pieces and thrown into a lake in Essex.

The Old Bailey heard that the South African had willingly taken part in the violent games based on the hit TV series. 

But the extreme 'pranks' were often filmed by drinking buddies Scott ‘Gary’ Hunt, 42, and Quye, who could be heard laughing hysterically as he set fire to his own pubic hair, ate chillies and was shot at with a BB gun while wearing women’s underwear in clips shown to court.

In one clip they sing the Kings of Leon hit Sex on Fire as Mr Buchel rubs a scotch bonnet chilli pepper on his genitals.

His remains were discovered in White Hart lakes, in Dagenham, by a young fisherman  on 1 April last year.

The court heard that the young man had mistaken Mr Buchel's severed left thigh for a dead fish and had poked the body part with a stick. 

The rest of his body was recovered more than a fortnight after he had been reported missing by his worried family.

Mr Buchel, known as ‘Southy’, moved into a flat with Hunt after splitting up from his wife in December 2013 and the housemates would drink with Quye, who lived in a block of flats next to their building.

Their drinking sessions at Quye’s home would involve playing a game they called ‘Jackass-style stunts’, based on the US TV series. Mr Buchel was a willing participant in the stunts, but often bore the brunt of the injuries sustained.

Before the clips were played in court, Mr Justice Spencer warned the jury: ‘Steel yourselves for watching something unpleasant, but no more unpleasant than one sees on television in its extreme form these days.’

Mr Buchel's estranged wife Sharon cried as she told the court about an incident on 13 December 2013, just four weeks after her ex-husband had moved in to Hunt’s flat.

Mr Buchel was attacked by Hunt and Quye before being hit around the face with dumbbell weights.

‘He looked terrible’, Mrs Buchel said. ‘He looked like somebody from Star Wars. His head was swollen like a watermelon...his eyeballs were bleeding.

Buchel (pictured) had been drinking in a park before ending up, extremely drunk, at Quye’s flat, where he became a 'soft target' for the men

‘He had no eyebrows. His eyelashes had been singed. Some of his goatee was missing, it had been burnt off.

‘He had a sheet wrapped around him, which was covered in blood.

‘He just looked at me. I started crying... I dropped to my knees. I said "What have they done to you?"

‘He was trying to talk but some blood was coming from his mouth.’

Mr Buchel was not seen alive after the night of 13 March last year - exactly three months after the incident his wife described.

He had been drinking in a park before ending up, extremely drunk, at Quye’s flat, where a number of others were present throughout the evening, including Quye, Hunt, Kwiatkowski and Quinn.

‘Neill Buchel was rendered virtually helpless by drink and was a very soft target for the brutal and cowardly attack at the hands of those who professed to be his friends,’ said prosecutor Sally O’Neill QC.

Gary Hunt (left) was cleared of Buchel’s murder, but convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by hiding the body.  Bradley Andison, 47, admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice 

One witness described seeing Mr Buchel on his knees in the sitting room, with his head completely covered by material.

Quye and Kwiatowski were seen standing over him shouting abuse with Quye wielding a large rubber mallet.

Andison was later called to the flat, where by this time Mr Buchel’s lifeless body was in the bathroom, to help them dispose of the body by taking it away in a van.

Worried Mrs Buchel contacted police and a murder investigation was launched even before his left thigh turned up in the lake.

Alan Quinn, 28, was convicted of perverting the course of justice

Ms O’Neill said: ‘On 1 April 2014 a young fisherman who was walking around the lakes detected something he first thought was a dead fish.

‘It turned out to be a human thigh. The police were informed and the area was searched by police divers and using police dogs.

‘Over the next few days several other body parts were found in the same area - ten body parts.

‘The torso had been wrapped in a duvet and weighed down with stones.

‘Other body parts appeared to have been wrapped in red curtain, which had come loose.

‘They had clearly been in the water for some time, but all of the body was recovered, ten parts in all.’

The body parts were found to have multiple blunt force injuries most likely resulting from kicking or stamping.

Quye and Kwiatkowski denied murder, but were found guilty by a jury after more than 30 hours of deliberation.

Hunt was cleared of Buchel’s murder, but convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by hiding the body.

Alan Quinn, 28, was convicted of perverting the course of justice while Colin Bushaway, 61, was cleared of the charge and an alternative of preventing a lawful burial.

Bradley Andison, 47, admitted attempting to pervert the course of justice. 

The four defendants will be sentenced on 15 April.
