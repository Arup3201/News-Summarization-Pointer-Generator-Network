Coins lost down the back of couches and rubbish dumps are costing the Royal Australian Mint $110 million to replace.

According to the mint's chief executive officer, the 255 million coins it produces a year makes up for those that disappear.

It costs the Royal Australian Mint 6 cents a year to produce a 5-cent coin

Ross MacDiarmid made his first appearance before a treasury estimates hearing this week in Canberra and told bemused senators that each Australian loses 10 coins every year.

'We do not have excess coins and, if there are mutilated coins coming back, they are relatively small in number throughout the year,' he said.

'Most of the coins that we provide are against coins that disappear down the back of chairs, down the back of car seats, into rubbish dumps and, in some cases, are taken overseas.

'Or they are sitting in people's drawers for long periods of time or in jars.'

Every year, $110 million is spent to mint coins that are lost down the back of a couch and car seats, in rubbish dumps and taken overseas

Upon hearing this, NSW Senator Sam Dastyari said: 'That is the most interesting thing I have heard all day.'

Mr MacDiarmid also revealed it cost the mint 6c to produce one 5c coin.

He said the mint had submitted a proposal to review the range of coins it produced, which included the 5c piece.

Though it may be practical to scrap the coin, Mr MacDiarmid said it would depend on reactions from consumers, banks and other stakeholders, in particular charities who use it as a way to raise money.

'The demand for coins is actually diminishing,' he said.

'What we do not know at this stage is to what degree and over what time frame.

'Some countries around the world are seeing flatlining; other countries are seeing it decline faster.

'In our case, we are seeing a decline, which is why I think this review process is perfectly timed.'

Mr MacDiarmid said the drop in coin demand was because of technology advances in credit cards.

Currently, there are 5 billion coins in circulation in Australia - which according to Mr MacDiarmid is not a lot compared to international standards.

The CEO was appearing before the Economics Legislation Committee looking into the privatisation of the Royal Australian Mint.
