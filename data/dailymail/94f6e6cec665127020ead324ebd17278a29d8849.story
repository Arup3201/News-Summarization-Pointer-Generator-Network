The taxpayer has spent thousands of pounds on media training for gaffe-prone ministers to learn how not to looked daft on the television.

Eight government departments have been forced to admit at least 19 ministers have been dispatched to courses on how to smile for the camera, deliver soundbites and dodge tricky questions from journalists.

Companies hired by the government tell politicians how media interviews are ‘a mixture of opportunity and danger’ as ministers claimed that without the training, the public would not ‘understand’ what they were doing to the country.

Liberal Democrat Ed Davey has been sent on media training twice - once when a junior business minister and then again when he became Energy Secretary and joined the Cabinet

Several departments refused to say how much the courses cost, claiming it breached commercial confidentiality.

But the total bill is estimated to run into thousands of pounds.

Labour
MP Luciana Berger, who unearthed the figures, said ministers should 
stop worrying about how they look on TV and get on with running the 
country.

One
Cabinet minister - Energy Secretary Ed Davey - has been sent on media 
training twice, though Miss Berger questioned whether he got ‘value for 
money’.

In
June 2010 when a minister at the Department for Business, Innovation 
and Climate Change Mr Davey had £700 worth of media training.

Then
in July this year, the Department for Energy and Climate Change spent 
another £2,160 on extra training for Mr Davey with private firm Electric
Airwaves, which has previously worked with the Disney empire.

Earlier
this month Mr Davey was caught off guard by questions about David 
Cameron's shock announcement about forcing energy firms to give 
customers the lowest tariff. Mr Davey tore off his microphone and called
a halt to an interview.

According
to a series of parliamentary questions, 19 ministers have received 
media training since in coalition was formed in May 2012.

Miss Berger told MailOnline: ’It’s 
astounding that 19 out of touch ministers have spent at least £12,000 – the 
equivalent of one classroom assistant - on media training.

’Government departments are stocked full of press officers, why weren’t these minsters able to get training from them?

’Instead of worrying about how they look on TV minsters should focus on delivering for the public.’

Five ministers at the Ministry of Justice have been trained in how to deal with journalists.

Crispin
Blunt and Jonathan Djanogly, who were both fired in last month’s 
reshuffle, attended a £3,000 session with Lib Dem minister Lord McNally,
provided by the Chartered Institute of Public Relations on 19 July 
2010.

In-house training was also given to Mr Blunt and new ministers Jeremy Wright and Helen Grant.

Ms
Grant defended the spending, saying there is ‘a high level of interest 
in the work of the Ministry of Justice and it is right that the public 
know and understand the work of the Department’.

She
added: ‘The training was designed to aid ministers so they are able to 
clearly communicate to the public the work of the Ministry of Justice 
and the reforms that are being undertaken across our policy areas.’

Lord Henley, a former environment and crime minister, made the news last year - for winning first prize at the World Marmalade Awards

The Department for Work and Pensions said training had been given to welfare minister Lord Freud and Maria Miller, who was promoted to the Cabinet as Culture Secretary in last month’s reshuffle.

The training was given by Sara Jones Associates Ltd, but the ministry refused to say how much it cost.

Recycling minister Lord Taylor was given media training at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs twice, in October 2011 and again in February this year. He has since been promoted to the Home Office.

At the Foreign Office media training has been given to Henry Bellingham, who was sacked in the reshuffle, and Alistair Burt. Together with French lessons for Europe Minister David Lidington, the training bill came to £4,620.

The Department of Health paid £500 for one unnamed minister to be trained by private firm Millbank Media which warns clients that interviews ‘present a mixture of opportunity and danger’.

The company promises: ‘We’ll help you to work out what your story is, define your key messages and then show you how to articulate them in lively, accessible and persuasive language.’

In addition to Mr Davey’s £700 of training, the Business department spent another £1,400 to train John Hayes and Baroness Wilcox.

The Home Office said it had sent Lib Dem Lynne Featherstone on ‘a half-day media and presentation training session’. She is now at the Department for International Development.

Lord Henley, a former environment and crime prevention minister who last year won the top prize at the World Marmalade Awards, was also given a ‘two-hour media training session’.

The Ministry of Defence’s ’internal media and communications training organisation’ trained Lord Astor and Peter Luff, who was ousted in the reshuffle.

The departments for Education, Communities and Local Government, Transport, International Development, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the Cabinet Office said no ministers had been given media training.
