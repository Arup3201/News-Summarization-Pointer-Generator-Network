You can tell a lot by looking at someones possessions - personality, interests, likes and passions.

One Italian photographer has decided to paint a portrait of her family, but instead of using actual photographs of her relatives, we are left to imagine how they might appear based on what they own.

From leather satchels and handkerchiefs to blocks of cheese and cookware, Florence-based artist Camilla Catrambone's family album is curiously captivating.

The series is simply titled 'Portraits of my Family,' and displays a whole host of everyday treasures.

'I‘ve always been fascinated by objects, and I think somehow every person is represented by their personal objects, the objects they choose, the ones they are attached to, and the way they use them tells you a story,' Ms Catrambone states on her website.

'When I started doing this project, I felt that the objects belonged to my relatives, starting from the ones of my beloved grandparents, were still full of energy and were capable of reminding me moments I shared with them. I started to feel the need to use them to go back to a precise memory. In order to do that I started to reorganize these objects, to recall a specific image I had of that person.

Grandpa Antonio: If something needed fixing, Grandpa Antonio would be the one to do it

If I look for example at the image of my grandpa Mario, I can go back in time when we sat at his writing table and fully feel the mood of that moment.

The objects represented in every picture don’t talk about the entire life of my grandpa, but the portray deeply describes a moment I shared with him.

My mom no.2: It might be something of an Italian stereotype but one gets the feeling from these portraits that this is a family who loves their food and are pretty cook and cooking it too...

The aim of the project is to portray the people I’ve grown up with to build my family tree using the objects owned by them, giving the portray a very deep and intimate touch.'

The series explores how people are remembered and what we can tell of a person through their possessions.
