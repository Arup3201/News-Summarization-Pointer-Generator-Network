NBC's New Year's Eve coverage has been slammed as 'disgusting' after one guest mocked Pearl Harbor survivors for being so old that they could only chew soft food.

Comedienne Natasha Leggero made the cruel joke at the expense of veterans as she joined actors Jane Lynch and Anthony Anderson on the 'New Year's Eve with Carson Daly' show on Tuesday night.

Daly asked the guests about an insensitive tweet that Spaghettios sent on Peal Harbor Day.

Cruel: Natasha Leggero, right, appeared on Carson Daly's New Year's Eve show and joked that Pearl Harbor survivors are now so old they can only eat SpaghettiOs because they're softÂ 

The company had tweeted a picture of 
its SpaghettiOs mascot holding an American flag and asking people to 
'take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us' - which some saw as a 
tasteless marketing ploy.

'It offended a lot of people, corporations glomming on to, you know, 
sentimental American historic traditions, seemingly looking for people 
in business. It wasn't good. But you were offended for another reason,' 
Daly said.

'I'm offended because they were referring to SpaghettiOs as pasta,' said Jane Lynch, NewsBusters reported.

Leggero then added: 'It sucks that the only survivors of Pearl Harbor are being mocked by the only food they can still chew.'

Oops: Leggero's comment came as the guests spoke about an insensitive tweet that SpaghettiOs had sent out on Pearl Harbor Day

After Leggero mocked the veterans, Anthony Anderson whooped with laughter - and couldn't stop.

As the segment aired, viewers were not impressed.

'Natasha
 Leggero just made a joke about the SpaghettiOs Pearl Harbor tweet that 
was probably more offensive than the tweet itself,' one viewer wrote on 
Twitter.

'Making fun of Pearl Harbor vets? Changing channel. Disgusting. Really NBC?' another said.

One other viewer added on the network's Facebook page: 'Shame on you, NBC, for making fun of the WWII vets.'

Having a laugh: The other guests, especially actor Anthony Anderson, left, found her comment hilarious. Glee favorite Jany Lynch said what she found more offensive was SpaghettiOs being deemed 'a pasta'

After SpaghettiOs' insensitive tweet last month, the company issued an apology.

'We apologize for our recent tweet in remembrance of Pearl Harbor Day,' it wrote on its Twitter account. 'We meant to pay respect, not to offend.'
