A New York elementary school principal has been accused of forcing students whose families can't afford school books or breakfast to pay $110 each for an annual, over-the-top ball - and she is now the subject of a Department of Education probe.

Marcella Sills, principal at Queens' PS106, has held the decadent prom the past three years at rental venues such as Russo's on the Bay in Howard Beach.

She enforces a strict dress code of white wedding-type dresses for girls and rented tuxedos with tails for boys, according to The New York Post.

The educator, known for driving a BMW, sporting fur coats and regularly not showing up for school, reportedly acts as belle of the ball at the events, dressing in her own long, white bridal-style frock, often accessorized with elbow-length gloves.

Parents and former teachers told The Post
 students must foot the bill for their outfits, which Sills chooses 
herself at stores such as Men's Wearhouse and David's Bridal.

'It's absurd,' said one former teacher exclaimed to the newspaper.

'This
 is a school where children are given a free breakfast and free lunch, 
and you're asking them to pay money for a lavish, unnecessary event.'

Another teacher agreed basic necessities at the school should have been a priority.

'Some
 children didn't have materials because their parents couldn't afford 
them,' the teacher said. 'It was a struggle and a fight to get crayons, 
pencils and a notebook.'

According to The Post, PS106 is 
nicknamed 'the school of no' because it offers no gym, no art classes, 
no textbooks covering the Common Core standards and also has no nurse's 
office.

The newspaper's sources claim the school teaches its kindergarteners in rat-infested trailers and has movies playing daily for all grades, while Sills barely ever shows.

'She's evil,' former PS 106 teacher Patricia Walsh said of the principal who is on a base salary of $128,000. 'She finds pleasure in ruining people's lives.'

Prompted by the report, schools Chancellor Carmen Fari√±a announced an investigation into PS 106 Sunday, claiming the revelations about the school and its principal were 'deeply troubling.'

Sills has not yet returned MailOnline's request for comment.

On Sunday,
 The Post reported the 234 students at the Far Rockaway school have no 
math or reading and writing books for the rigorous Common Core 
curriculum.

The school's nurse has to make do without a sink, refrigerator or cot because there is no space for a medical office.

Instead of hiring a substitute when a teacher is away, students are divided between other classes, the Post reported.

A parent told the newspaper that the trailers where 40 kindergarteners attend classes reek of 'animal urine.'

Sills, 48, joined the school nine years ago but appears to have become lax in her attendance.Sources claimed she often takes days off and if she does come in she is rarely seen before 11 a.m.

'She strolls in whenever she wants,' one source said.

PS 106, an isolated, decrepit building surrounded by vacant, weed-filled lots a block and a half from the beach, is allocated $2.9 million to serve a low-income population.

Some 98 per cent of its students eligible for free lunches.
