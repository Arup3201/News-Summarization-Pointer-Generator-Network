Controversial media personality Derryn Hinch has posted a video slamming celebrities participating in the 'I Stand For Mercy' campaign as 'hypocritical' and declaring his support for the death penalty in Australia.

In a video labelled 'Derryn Hinch on Bali Nine Executions', the radio and television presenter expressed no sympathy when bluntly stating that Bali Nine ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan 'ran the risk' when they attempted to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia ten years ago.

'People like Alan Jones, Germaine Greer, Asher Keddie, David Wenham, they’ve all lined up and they’ve all signed up, and I think it’s hypocritical,' Hinch says in the video.

Derryn Hinch has slammed the Australian celebrities who participated in a video to help save Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan from facing the firing squad after attempting to smuggle heroin a decade ago

Australian media personalities, including Asher Keddie and her artist husband, Vincent Fantauzzo,  joined the campaign initiated by artist Ben Quilty to request mercy from Indonesian authorities

Never been one to hold back on his views, Hinch says in his video, posted on his website, Human Headline, that the Australian pair were fully aware of the ramifications if caught drug smuggling in Indonesia.

'It’s the same in China, in Malaysia, in Thailand, in Vietnam, that’s the risk you run,' he said bluntly.

Hinch went on to question the well-known Australian personalities' stance on the death penalty - asking whether the only sought mercy for their own countrymen.

'Did they stand up a week ago and say I stand for mercy for the Brazilian who was executed in Indonesia or the one from the Netherlands or the Indonesian woman or somebody from Malawi?' he asked.

'Are you against the death penalty for the terrorists?' he added in his rant.

He then expressed his support for the death penalty and believes that most Australians would stand right there alongside him.

'I support the death penalty for some crimes…but in cases of rapists, child murderers, people who kill policemen, people who kill prison guards, and terrorists, the death penalty should stand.

'We should have the death penalty in Australia. If we had a referendum, if Tony Abbott had the guts to do it, 75 per cent of Australians would agree with me.' 

Bryan Brown joins other Australian media personalities in showing support for Chan and Sukumaran

Australian war artist Ben Quilty is the person behind the campaign requesting mercy from Indonesian authorities and has produced a star-studded video called I Stand For Mercy.

The video contains a number of contributions from famous Australians saying how upset they are and that the men’s lives should be spared. It features the likes of actors Asher Keddie, Bryan Brown and Claudia Karvan, musicians Missy Higgins and Megan Washington, and broadcasters Alan Jones and Andrew Denton. 

Chan and Sukumaran face death by firing squad as early as next Sunday for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia, and their clemency bids have been ignored. 

Quilty became a mentor and close friend of Sukumaran after he was jailed, and has used his creative talents to create the powerful video in support of the two men.

'The message is just for the boys to know there are people walking with them in this very dark time,' Quilty told news.com.au. 

Richard Roxborough has also joined the I Stand For Mercy Campaign

The 41-year-old is trying to organise a candlelight vigil for the pair, to 'send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.' 

'I want the barristers to walk into that prison and tell the boys how many people are thinking of them and supporting them,' he said. 

The 41-year-old has recruited dozens of renowned musicians to ‘perform for clemency’ and send a message that the death penalty is unacceptable.

“It’s for Myu and Andrew - I’d do anything for those two boys,” he said. 

'I want to send a strong message to the men themselves and their families that there are a lot of prominent Australians in the arts, media and all parts of our community who are on their side.'

Co-founder of the Mercy Campaign, Brigid Delaney said the video highlighted the support for the two men on death row.

'It's amazing how much support the petition asking for clemency has received. We have more than 50,000 signatures, with thousands being added each day as the message of mercy spreads,' she said.

'This video is part of that campaign, respectfully asking the Indonesian government for mercy for Myuran and Andrew.'

A concert is also planned in Sydney on Thursday in support of the Mercy Campaign. Details on the event are still being finalised.

Chan and fellow inmate Myuran Sukumaran have been on death row since 2006

The families of Bali Nine ringleaders Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, have made a desperate plea to Indonesia's president to reconsider the pair's executions in light of the work they have done to improve the lives of fellow inmates.

On Thursday, Chan's last ditch attempt at a clemency bid was rejected by President Widodo, following Sukumaran's rejected bid in December, officially exhausting the  legal appeals against their death sentence for attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia. 

The relatives of Chan and Sukumaran said they were devastated to hear the decision about the clemency bids, and pleaded for the president to visit the pair in Kerobokan Jail.
