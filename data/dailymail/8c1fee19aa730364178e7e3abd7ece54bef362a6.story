Older than Stonehenge, taller than the White Cliffs of Dover and wider than 50 football pitches: this is the magical Iron Age hill fort that has been bought by the National Trust to preserve for the nation.

At more than 2,000 years old, Hambledon Hill in Dorset has a rich natural and archaeological story dating back to before the construction of Stonehenge. 

It is home to half the UK's butterfly population, having escaped the advances of agriculture.

And from the summit of the fort it is possible to see three counties - Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire.  

'Magical': This is Hambledon hill fort in Dorset, the 'magical' landscape that the National Trust has bought in a bid to preserve the 6,000-year-old pastures

The Iron Age fort is the first the trust has acquired for 30 years and overlies one of the most significant early neolithic landscapes in western Europe dating back almost 6,000 years, the trust said. 

Causeway enclosures seen on the hill date back 5,500 years, and together with nearby National Trust-owned Hod Hill the site tells the story of the beginnings of farming, the need for defence and the arrival of the Romans in Britain, the trust said.

The fort is also a national nature reserve, with 28 species of butterfly including the Adonis blue, dark green fritillary and green hairstreak recorded on the nationally important chalk grassland site.

And it is home to at least five species of orchids, including the autumn lady's tresses, as well as glow worms, brown hares, kestrels and meadow pipits.

Historical: It is the size of 50 football pitches, twice the height of the White Cliffs of Dover, older than Stonehenge, and home to half the UK's butterfly population

Preserved: The pastures in Dorset have managed to maintain the population of wildlife as farmers have avoided the area as agriculture has advanced over the years

Simon Ford, National Trust wildlife adviser, said: 'The beauty of a magical place like Hambledon Hill is the combination of a rich natural and archaeological story that goes back thousands of years.

'Wandering around a site whose human history pre-dates Stonehenge and takes you back to the early days of farming makes the heart skip a beat.

'The sound of a skylark ascending above the rich grassland and sight of a cloud of Adonis blue butterflies in flight touches the soul. This is a place where you feel totally connected to the world around you.'

Jerry Broadway, a National Trust volunteer working on Hambledon Hill, said: 'When I come here I feel like someone would when they go into St Paul's Cathedral.

Younger: The first stones at Stonehenge, near Salisbury, were thought to be raised in 2200 BC, making it far younger than the Iron Age hill fort bought by the Trust

Scale: The hill is twice the height of the White Cliffs of Dover, which stand at 350 feet, and from the summit, three counties are visible: Dorset, Somerset and Wiltshire

'When there is no one else around and I sit on the top of the hill looking at the view I feel very privileged. And to play a small part in looking after the hill is a good feeling.'

Hambledon Hill has been owned for the last three decades by the Hawthorn Trust and managed by Government conservation agency Natural England as a national nature reserve.

The purchase is being funded by a land purchase grant from Natural England and with money from a legacy left to the trust for the countryside in Dorset, and brings to seven the number of hill forts owned by the trust in the county.
