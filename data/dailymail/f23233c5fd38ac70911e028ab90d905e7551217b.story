A lost seal has been spotted 27 miles inland in a Lincolnshire town while fishing for food.

The common seal normally found living off the east coast was pictured at Low Locks, off the River Welland, near Deeping St James. 

Normally found in the Wash, it is thought to have arrived at its current location during the last week. 

The seal was spotted by photographer Paul Marriott at the bottom of a residential garden 27 miles inland 

A seal expert said it was rare for them to receive a call regarding a seal like this one discovered on land 

RSPCA officer Sarah Angell said: 'We have received a number of calls about a seal that has been spotted in the rivers around Deeping St James, in Lincolnshire. 

'One of our inspectors has gone out to check it and he is happy this seal is fit and healthy.

'Seals will swim down rivers in search of food. This seal appears to be following a dredger that is turning up fish, it is likely this easy meal is what has brought the seal inland.' 

Normally found in the Wash, it is thought to have arrived at its current location during the past week

The RSPCA said the seal appears to be healthy and should find its own way back in time 

The seal was found 27 miles from the nearest water, the River Welland in Lincolnshire (above)

Nigel Croasdale, general manager of the Hunstanton sea life centre, told MailOnline: 'We get alerted to one or two seals every year that have come up stream from an estuary and ended up in river water. 

'It's rare, as the seal is typically on the coast in salty water.

'My advice to people would be to not approach the seal as it is a wild animal and it could bite. It could also be dangerous for dogs.'

He added: 'It is very hard to catch a seal when it's healthy, it is an enormous risk. 

'More often than not, when you approach a seal on land it will go back into the water. 

'But if it's poorly then you have more chance of catching them and we can then give them an immediate inspection and bring them back to a rescue centre.'
