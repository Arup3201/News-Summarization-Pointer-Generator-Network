In the last two days of his life, Tyler Clementi visited his roommate's Twitter page 38 times and saved screen shots of two messages posted there.

One proclaimed that the roommate saw Mr Clementi ‘making out with a dude’.

The other ‘dared’ friends to use a web chat program to watch when Mr Clementi was due to have a second encounter with the man.

Jurors learned those details Tuesday 
during the testimony of Gary Charydczak, a detective in the Middlesex 
County Prosecutor's Office who testified in roommate Dharun Ravi's 
criminal trial.

The detective said he learned about Mr
Clementi's computer use from examining the hard drive of the laptop 
that was found in his Rutgers University dorm room.

He displayed the Tweets that he said were saved to Mr Clementi's hard drive under the names ‘untitled.jpg’ and ‘secondtime.jpg’.

Twenty-year-old Ravi faces 15 counts 
including bias intimidation and invasion of privacy against Mr Clementi,
who jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge on September 
22, 2010- one day after authorities say Ravi attempted to spy on him.

Prosecutors say Ravi used Twitter 
first to tell followers that he had seen his roommate ‘making out with a
dude’ on September 19, and two days later to ‘dare’ them to video chat 
him when Mr Clementi had again asked to have the room to himself so he 
could have a guest over.

Authorities also say Ravi told friends about the expected dorm-room liaison through other means, including text messages.

During testimony Monday, jurors were shown texts he sent to a friend from high school who was then attending Cornell University.

Textual evidence: Ravi's friend from high school Michelle Huang testified on Monday saying that he told her that he was planning to host a 'viewing party' for the second time that Mr Clementi asked for the room

In one part of the exchange, the friend, Michelle Huang, texted Ravi: ‘Watch out, he may come for you when you're sleeping.’

Ravi responded that he had his computer set to alert him if anyone was in his bed when he wasn't there.

‘It keeps the gays away,’ he said.

The exchange may help prosecutors show
that Ravi had malice toward gays - a necessary element to persuade 
jurors to convict Ravi on the bias intimidation charges he faces. But he
and his friend went on to talk about some of their gay friends.

In testimony earlier Tuesday, Rutgers 
computer system manager Timothy Hayes told jurors it appears Ravi's 
computer was used in two video chats on September 21, 2010.

That doesn't prove that Ravi spied on 
his roommate, but it may bolster the prosecution's case that he was 
preparing to attempt to spy on Mr Clementi that night, just one day 
before Mr Clementi committed suicide.

Tragic end: Rutgers student Tyler Clementi jumped off the George Washington Bridge in 2010 after webcam footage showing he and another man kissing circulated the internet

Residence hall: Clementi and Ravi lived in Room 30 of Davidson Hall

Authorities say Ravi used his webcam 
to see his roommate and another man kissing on September 19 and viewed 
it from the room across the hall from his own.

Mr Hayes told jurors that the data the
university collected was not able to show online interactions between 
two computers on the same wing of the dorm.

Records show that the computers of 
both Ravi and another dorm resident, Molly Wei, had a record of a video 
chat September 19 at about the time she said that they briefly used it 
to see Mr Clementi and the other man kissing.

Mystery witness: A man who identifies himself only as M.B. told the court today that he noticed the webcam in Clementi and Ravi's room and that he and Clementi met on a gay dating website

Prosecutors also have been building the case that Ravi went to the rooms of dorm mates that evening to test his webcam.

They tried to use Hayes' testimony to 
corroborate that. He said there was a web chat between his computer and 
Lokesh Ojha's at 6.58pm that evening, and another with Alissa Agarwal 
starting 46 minutes later.

Both those students testified that Ravi showed them how they could use a web chat program to see what was happening in his room.

There has been no evidence that anyone used a videochat service to spy on Mr Clementi that night.

Court documents suggest that Ravi's computer was unplugged before his guest arrived.

Mr Hayes said it seems that Ravi's computer was unplugged for about two hours that night, beginning at 9.25pm.

Meanwhile, Ravi told a former high
