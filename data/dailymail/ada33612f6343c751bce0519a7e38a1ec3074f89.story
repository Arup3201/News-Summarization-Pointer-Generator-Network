A mystery benefactor tweeting clues to hidden cash sparked a frenzy in Los Angeles last night, with hundreds of people swarming the area searching for dollar bills.

Throngs of people scavenged through garden beds, searched under bus stops and, police say, caused a traffic nightmare, in Burbank as they hunted for envelopes of cash, according to NBC.

Within an hour of the anonymous donor posting a clue on his Twitter account @HiddenCash, the area around the local shopping center was inundated with people.

The unknown donor began their pay-it-forward scavenger hunt on May 22 in San Francisco, claiming they were a successful real estate investor who wanted to share their wealth.

It is now spreading throughout the West Coast, with the donor promising to make it 'bigger and better'.

Chris Treichel and his co-worker found the first cash drop of $135.

About 20 minutes later, 14-year-old Tatiana Ramirez spotted an envelope full of cash she said she wanted to put toward her grandmother's medical bills.

Sean Zerbe and his friends found the last envelope of the night, and tweeted their victory photo from the car, according to KTLA-TV Channel 5.

A young woman ran right in front of my car a few days ago. I will do my best to pick locations that are safe, but please use common sense and caution,' they wrote.

'Please also be respectful to the locations themselves and surrounding businesses. And be kind and happy with each other, as that's what this is all about.'

However the unknown giver also tweeted that he or she 'had no plans to stop' and wanted to 'keep getting bigger and better'.

The donor has also chosen to remain anonymous, in case people who know him or her criticize the decision to give away so much money.

'This is my way of giving back to the community and also having fun,' the donor said.

'The bigger idea is just to give back, both financially and a sense of fun to the community that has made me wealthy.'
