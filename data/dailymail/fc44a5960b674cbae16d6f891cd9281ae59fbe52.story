As far as cross-sport dream teams go, it doesn't get much better than Michael Jordan and Tom Brady.

The NBA legend and the NFL icon teamed up in the Bahamas in a game of basketball.

Four-time Super Bowl champion Brady showed he is quite handy at basketball as well, draining a shot from the top of the key.

Brady had recently posted a video on Facebook of a daring cliff dive while on holiday with wife Gisele Bundchen.

He is taking a well earned break during the NFL off-season after guiding the New England Patriots to victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX at Glendale, Arizona on February 1.

Jordan, meanwhile, is widely regarded as the best basketball player ever having won six NBA titles, five MVP crowns and two Olympic gold medals.
