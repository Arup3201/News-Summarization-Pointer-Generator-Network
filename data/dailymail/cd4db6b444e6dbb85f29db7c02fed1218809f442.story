James Ward-Prowse has shown his determination to make a swift comeback from injury after hitting the gym... wearing his foot brace.

The Southampton starlet was ruled out for 10 weeks after he suffered a fractured foot in his team's 1-0 Premier League win against Swansea in September.

But while he would be forgiven for putting his feet up at home, the 19-year-old midfielder is wasting no time in his rehabilitation as he lifts heavy weights in the Saints' fitness room.

Southampton boss Ronald Koeman, speaking after Ward-Prowse suffered the injury blow in September, has tipped the youngster to come back stronger.

'It's unlucky but okay,' said the Dutchman.

'The boy has to keep going and it's difficult because he had a great start to the season.

'But it's part of the football and he will come back'.
