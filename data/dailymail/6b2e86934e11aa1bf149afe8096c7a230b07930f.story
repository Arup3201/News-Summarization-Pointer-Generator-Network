Helena Costa, football's first female professional coach, has remained tight-lipped over why she decided to step down as coach of Clermont Foot, but stressed that it was her decision.

Costa became the first female coach of a professional men's club in the top two tiers of any European league when she was appointed last month.

Costa, 36, said that she had gone through her reasons with club president Claude Michy and that she would not disclose them publicly.

Game changer: It was less than a month ago that 36-year-old Helena Costa was heralded as a dynamic force for change in a sport traditionally dominated by men upon being appointed coach of Clermont Foot

'I had a lot of points that I discussed personally with the president and after that discussion I took my decision,' she said.

'The president knows exactly what it is and he's the only person that I have to discuss (it with).'

Despite her resignation, Costa is targeting future opportunities to continue her managerial career.

'I thought over my holidays so of course I would appreciate if I could continue but it was my decision so I have no reasons to be sad,' she added.

'I hope in the future other opportunities will come. Only the president knows the reason for my decision.

'I hope this won’t cause prejudice towards women in the sport. I want to be viewed as a coach.'

Career: Helena Costa has previously worked with youth players at Benfica, and coached the women's national teams of Qatar and Iran (pictured), as well as scouting for Celtic

Costa suggested that she had least broken a glass ceiling, by becoming the first female football manager ever - albeit without actually taking charge of a training session, let alone a game.

There was speculation that Muslim players had not wanted to work with a woman boss, but club president Claude Michy played this down as an unfounded rumour, saying: ‘I won’t return to this subject’.
