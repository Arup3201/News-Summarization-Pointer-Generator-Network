They are some of the largest creatures on the planet, swallowing tonnes of tiny fish and zooplankton in a single gulp.

But it seems that despite their vast appetites, whales are unable to enjoy their food - they have lost the ability to taste sweet, bitter and the savoury taste known as umami.

New genetic research on whales has discovered that these giant sea mammals lack the key bits of DNA needed to detect these tastes in food.

Indeed, some whales are even unable to detect whether their food has gone off, say the researchers. 

Penguins lost three of the five basic vertebrate tastes—sweet, bitter and umami—more than 20 million years ago and never regained them, a recent study found.

Researchers at the University of Michigan say the genes were lost after cold Antarctic temperatures interfered with taste perception.

They say the findings suggest that as penguins are meat eaters, they may not be able to detect the flavour of the fish they consume as they lack the umami receptor genes. 

Compared with mammals, birds are thought to be poor tasters, due in part to the observations that they have fewer taste buds on their tongues and lack teeth for chewing food. 

Previous genetic studies showed that the sweet taste receptor gene is absent from the genomes of all birds examined to date. 

However, it appears that penguin's are particularly impoverished when it comes to taste. 

The researchers say it could explain why whales often die after eating inedible debris.

Dr Takushi Kishida, a biologist at the wildlife research centre of Kyoto University in Japan, who led the research, said: 'We found that all modern cetaceans are revealed to have lost the functional taste receptors.

'These results strongly indicate that profound changes in the chemosensory capabilities had occurred in the cetacean lineage during the period when ancestral whales migrated from land to water.'

The researchers, whose work is published in the journal of Zoological Letters, compared the genomes of minke whales from the Antarctic with DNA from bottlenose dolphins and cows.

They also used DNA sequences from Dall's porpoise and a Sei whale - the fourth biggest whale in the oceans.

They also studied the fossilised skulls of several extinct species of whale.

They found that the minke whales and dolphins all lacked genes for the taste receptors needed to detect sweet, umami and bitter.

Indeed, previous research on DNA from other whale species has shown that some also lack many of the receptors needed to taste sour.

It suggests that whales' palette is largely limited to salt - something that may be overwhelming in the salty seawater environment where they live.

By analysing the genomes, the researchers concluded that whales lost the ability to taste shortly after splitting from a common ancestor they share with cows.

Dr Kishida said that modern whales had a greatly reduced 'gustatory capability' as a result.

Toothed whales like killer whales and sperm whales also appear to have completely lost the ability to smell as they lack the parts of the nervous system required to detect and process smells.

Previous research by Dr Kishida and his team has shown that baleen whales - filter feeders that include the blue whale, humpback and minke whale - also have a limited sense of smell.

While they have olfactory nerves concentrated in their nasal cavities much like mammals on land, their air passages are closed while they dive.

It is thought instead that they can sniff the air, but in the most recent study the researchers also found that minke whales lack genes that allow them to smell whether food has spoiled.

They were also found to lack genes that are used by land mammals to detect the presence of predators nearby - such as the smell of urine from carnivores.

This ability to detect predators by scent is a common ability among most mammals on land. 

Dr Kishida said that the ability to smell predators may have disappeared as whales evolved as sharks and killer whales cannot be detected by smelling in the air.

As whales keep their nasal passages closed when diving they would also not be able to smell under water.

Chewing is also considered to be important in releasing the flavour from food, and as many cetaceans swallow their food whole, this may explain why they have lost many taste genes.

Writing in the journal of Zoological Letters, Dr Kishida said: 'This study indicates that all modern cetaceans lack innate avoidance behavior against spoiled smells, and the sense of tastes.

'This could be one of the reasons why cetaceans often die from ingesting inedible debris, and has implications for whale conservation.'
