A senior RAF airman who sold guns under the name 'Dr Evil' on a black market website with help from his wife has been jailed for six years.

John Yelland, 28, downloaded instruction manuals on how to build sub-machine guns among other weapons before buying materials on eBay to build them.

He then took to illegal trade website Black Market Reloaded with 25 firearms up for sale.

Jailed: John Yelland, 28, tried to sell 25 sub-machine guns on the black market after serving in Afghanistan. He has now been jailed for six years after being arrested at work

The RAF Senior Aircraftsman, who served in Afghanistan, also set up his own website in a bid to sell a range of Tasers, batons and pepper spray.

And his wife was jailed for helping ferry a gun over to his RAF base.

Jailing him for six years, the judge at Norwich Crown Court condemned Yelland's 'sinister' actions that he appeared to 'relish'.

Yelland, based at RAF Marham, Norfolk, had become increasingly 'paranoid and isolated' after returning from tours in Cyprus, Norfolk and Qatar.

He was arrested at work after a parcel was intercepted.

He ordered the package to go to his mother-in-law's address in County Durham - though she was uninvolved in the scam.

She immediately forwarded the parcel to his RAF base, but it was spotted by mailing staff in Tyneside, County Durham.

The package contained a Taurus self-loading pistol and three magazines - one of which contained an illegal dummy bullet.

Raiding his home, Norfolk Police and RAF Police seized two laptops, a stun gun and pepper spray in a joint operation.

They also arrested his now-estranged 
wife Maimie, 25, who has been jailed for making a 60-second phone call 
to her mother warning her to forward the incriminating parcel.

Yesterday,
 Yelland admitted two counts of attempting to sell prohibited weapons, 
possession of a prohibited weapon and attempting to possess a prohibited
 weapon.

He also admitted 
attempting to manufacture a prohibited weapon, two further counts of 
possessing prohibited weapons and one of possessing ammunition without a
 firearms certificate.

Judge
 Anthony Bate condemned his actions, telling him he was a 'trusted' 
individual who was highly regarded and utilised for 'high profile 
visits' to the base.

Judge Bate told Yelland: 'You gave no indication to anyone else at that station to the dark side of your character.

'It’s plain in my view from the postings on the dark web that you appeared to relish dealing with like-minded individuals. The messages all had sinister undertones.'

He said Yelland appeared to enjoy the 'technical challenge' of building sub machine guns.

Help: His wife Maimie, 25, has also been jailed after the parcel was sent to her mother and she called to get her to forward it

Yelland will also be banned from using an encrypted communication device and have tightly-restricted internet access.

His
 estranged wife Maimie appeared alongside him and admitted transferring 
criminal property in relation to a call she made to her mother asking 
her to send the pistol.

Jailing
 her for six months, Judge Bate said anyone who plays a part, however 
brief, in the movement of a firearm must expect a 'robust' punishment to
 'deter others'.

Susannah Stevens, defending Yelland, said he had done 'incredibly well' in the RAF.

But Miss Stevens said it started to go wrong in 2010 when he was transferred to Cyprus and had to work under 'difficult conditions' due to lack of resources.

She said Yelland asked for help as he was worried about his mental state, began to feel increasingly isolated and depressed, and was bullied because he has a stutter.

'It doesn’t take a genius to work out some of the unpleasant sights he would have had to have dealt with,' added Miss Stevens.

She said Yelland was almost run over near an air base in Qatar and saw a man blown up in front of him in a rocket attack.

Miss Stevens added that when he returned to RAF Marham he became increasingly 'paranoid and isolated'.

She said there was further concern about Yelland after the barbaric murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London, in May 2013.

Miss Stevens said he had suffered such a devastating fall from grace that he had 'lost everything', including his career, 'his name, his reputation, but also his relationship with his wife'.

Neil Guest, defending Maimie Yelland, said she was in a 'traumatic position' of thinking her mother might be arrested after being sent the gun.

'She didn’t have time for mature thought,' added Mr Guest. 'It was a knee jerk reaction.'

Last night Ch Supt Nick Davison, of Norfolk Police, said it was good to see Yelland behind bars.

He said: 'Yelland thought nothing of making and storing the weapons and it is pleasing to see this man behind bars with a lengthy custodial sentence.'
