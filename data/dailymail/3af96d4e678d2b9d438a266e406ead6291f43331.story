A congressman and his wife have reunited two-year-old twin girls who were living in separate homes by adopting them into their own family.

Oklahoma congressman Markwayne Mullin told NewsOK that he was hesitant at first to expand his brood of three to five, but his wife convinced him otherwise.

Now, little Ivy and Lynette - who were born into 'kind of a bad situation' - are fully integrated into the Mullin family and they 'could not be happier,' says the congressman.

Before the adoption was approved on August 21, the blonde twins were living with distant relations of Mr Mullin's wife Christie, in separate but 'very loving' homes.

But the relatives, a grandmother and great aunt, had told Mrs Mullin that they hoped they'd live long enough to see the girls graduate.

The congressman's wife approached him several times about adopting the girls, but he told her it was a huge time commitment, and they already had their hands full with two sons, nine and eight, and a five-year-old girl.

He suggested he write a check, telling her 'it's easier sometimes to give money than it is to give time.'

Seeking guidance: The congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, said: '[God] opened our hearts to the idea of adoption' (pictured with wife Christie, sons Jim and Andrew, and daughter Larra)

But then Mrs Mullin pulled what her husband calls the 'trump card'. She asked him: 'Would you pray about it?'

'How do you pray about that?' said Congressman Mullin at a town meeting in Henryetta, Oklahoma, last week.

'I mean, really. "Hey Lord, would you please, please make her heart as selfish as mine"?'

So instead he prayed that God would change his own mind, 'And man did He ever,' he says.

The Congressman, who himself is the youngest of seven, told TheHill: 'Our family prayed for God's will and He opened our hearts to the idea of adoption.

'We were unsure about whether, at this time, we could handle the extra responsibility,' he added. 'But God's timing is always perfect.'

Now the congressman - who is part of the Cherokee nation, just like his twin girls - says Lynette and Ivy have taught him more than he ever expected.

'People say, "Man, you're going to be 
such a blessing to those girls,"' he said at the town meeting.

'And I'm going to tell you right now - if you're someone 
who's thinking about adoption - you're going to be blessed more by them 
than you will ever be a blessing to them.'

As for the girls themselves, they have apparently been doing well since being reunited.

'If you talk to anybody, they say twins 
need to be together. The bond between them is just amazing,' said Congressman Mullin.

'They can 
have a conversation with each other for hours and nobody else can 
understand it,' he added.

Loving couple: Congressman Mullin has been married to his high school sweetheart Christie for 16 years

Home sweet home: Congressman Mullin and his wife Christie live in Oklahoma with their five children

Congressman Mullin has been married to his wife and high school sweetheart Christie for 16 years.

When he was just 20, he and his wife took over his family's plumbing business after his father fell ill, and they struggled through financial troubles with just six employees.

Now, Mullin Plumbing is well-recognized in the area and proudly employs over 100 Oklahomans.

On his campaign website, the congressman describes himself as: 'an eastern Oklahoma native, successful businessman, rancher, family man and youth leader in his church.'

In a statement, the father-of-five said: 'The new Mullin seven look forward to all that life has to offer our family!'
