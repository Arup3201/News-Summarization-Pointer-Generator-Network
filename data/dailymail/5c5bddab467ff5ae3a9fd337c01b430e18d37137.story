Channel 4’s racing coverage have been dealt a blow with news that flagship presenter Clare Balding is to cut back her appearances from 40 to only nine per year.

In 2015, Balding will only front the Channel’s racing output from the Cheltenham Festival and Royal Ascot.

The station can take some comfort from the fact that Balding has signed a two-year deal and will also present their coverage of the Crufts dog show and 2016 Paralympics in Rio.

The fact that Balding, 43, has cut back on her work in racing was expected. She is in an in-demand presenter whose profile has soared way beyond the narrow confines of the racing world.

But not chosing to present coverage of the Boat race over the Grand National in April and also step down from the Derby at Epsom in June is a bitter blow.

Nick Luck, who will now assume the position of lead presenter, is a hugely talented broadcaster, but, without Balding, there is no-one on the team who can claim national recognition with appeal to a broader constituency of viewers.

Balding said: ‘I have been lucky and honoured to work as a racing broadcaster for the past 20 years and will continue to promote the sport on and off screen.

‘I look forward to working with the enormously talented Channel 4 Racing team at Cheltenham and Royal Ascot next year and, of course, to the Paralympics in Rio in 2016.

Ed Havard, Channel 4’s Head of Live Events said: ‘Clare is a broadcaster at the very top of her game and I’m delighted that we will be continuing to work with her on our racing coverage and the Rio Paralympics in 2016.’

On Balding’s decision to choose the Boat Race over the Grand National, a Channel 4 spokeswoman said: ‘She is very big supporter of female sport and wants to be involved with the first ever televised female Boat Race which will be an historical event.’
