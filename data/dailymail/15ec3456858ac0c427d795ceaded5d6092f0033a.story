England captain Eoin Morgan believes the growing debate over the size of modern bats is 'absolutely ridiculous' as the International Cricket Council considers a clampdown.

ICC chief executive Dave Richardson suggested earlier this week that lawmakers could look to reduce the size of bats - most significantly their depth - amid fears the balance of the game has shifted too far towards batsmen.

A host of batting records have fallen in the recent past with South Africa's AB de Villiers clubbing the fastest one-day century, from 31 balls, last month while India opener Rohit Sharma hit a record 264 in November last year.

Morgan, however, thinks those blaming bat sizes are missing the point.

Instead the 28-year-old believes recent rule changes in the 50-over format have conspired to boost scoring with the move to allow a maximum of four fielders outside the ring at any point, plus the use of two new balls, more likely factors.

'I think it is ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous,' he said.

'The fact that you can concentrate on the bat size when the rule change has been made so that you bowl with two new balls - the ball is never any older than 25 overs and you have an extra man in the circle.

'I think that is a point in itself. The bat size (debate) is ridiculous.'

At present the length and width of the bats is regulated, but the depth has become the talking point as manufacturers have developed new ways to increase the size of the 'sweet spot'.

Last year a report commissioned by the Marylebone Cricket Club - the lawmakers of the game - found the thickness of edges on modern bats had increased 300 per cent and in turn the 'sweet spot' has grown two-and-a-half times larger.

Those figures have led Richardson to suggest the laws should at least be reviewed.

Only last July the MCC's World Cricket Committee - which features former Australia skipper Steve Waugh - elected not to change the rules regarding bat sizes.

Australia opener David Warner and West Indies' Chris Gayle are two players who have come into focus for the size of their bats but Morgan, a batsman himself, has not felt any unfair advantage has been gained.

'I haven't come across a bat yet where I've said: 'This is ridiculous, this should be outlawed',' he added.

Morgan was speaking in Sydney, where England have assembled for the final part of their World Cup preparations, and was equally bullish when asked to assess his side's chances of lifting the World Cup for the first time.

'We're here to win the World Cup. That's the bottom line,' he said.

'Like every other team we're here to get the best out of ourselves and us at our best we can win this World Cup.

'It is certainly the most talented squad I've ever been a part of.'

England's World Cup hopes had been written off by many even before they arrived in Australia last month for the Tri-Series, when they defied expectation to reach the final.

Twice they convincingly beat world champions India, although any growing belief was tempered with a third successive defeat to Australia in last week's final at the WACA Ground.

Morgan's men relinquished a winning position in Perth, just as they had in Hobart in the previous game, and while the captain knows performances must be turned into wins there is reason to believe they are closing the gap on the top sides.

'We're in good shape. We've had a very productive month or so,' Morgan added.

'We have got a lot out of playing against good opposition, particularly the games we've played against Australia.

'We've covered a lot of bases, probably more so than I thought we would to be in this position.'

Morgan concedes one area of minor concern is his own form.

After hitting a defiant century against Australia in the Tri-Series opener the left-hander has twice suffered first-ball dismissals and admits he would have liked to have played a match-winning hand.

'That's a big emphasis on the team and we've done that so far,' he said.

'I've not done it yet, which has been disappointing but I think I'm in a good place and a good head space for where we are at the moment.'

He will most likely get two more chances to let his bat do the talking with warm-up games against West Indies and Pakistan at the SCG scheduled for later this week before England head south for their mouth-watering tournament-opener against Australia in front of 90,000 fans at the MCG on Valentine's Day.
