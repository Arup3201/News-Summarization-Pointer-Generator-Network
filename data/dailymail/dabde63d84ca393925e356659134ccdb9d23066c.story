Mauricio Pochettino insists the Europa League is a priority for Tottenham despite the decision to leave a host of first-teamers behind for their clash against Partizan Belgrade.

Spurs kick of their European campaign here in Serbia tomorrow night, but they go into the clash without Emmanuel Adebayor, Younes Kaboul, Danny Rose, Moussa Dembele and Nacer Chadli who have all been left back in England.

Pochettino, however, insists his decision to leave behind a number of his top stars does not reflect his attitude towards the Europa League.

Star striker Emmanuel Adebayor is one of many Tottenham players not to travel to Serbia

'We have a strong squad and we need to choose the best players for Thursday and those in the best condition to play against Partizan Belgrade,' Pochettino said at his pre-match press conference when asked about his decision to leave several stars behind.

'We decided not bring Adebayor, Kaboul,  Rose, Dembele and Chadli for different reasons.

'Yes, yes, of course the Europa League is a priority for us. All competitions are priorities for us,' the Argentina added.

'This year it is very important because the Europa League gives you the possibility to play in the next Champions League. It is an important competition for us.

'For me all my players are stars. But when we come to a different period, or a different problem or situation we have to analyse the squad and see what is the best condition for us to get three points. but for me Tottenham have a strong squad with different names.'

Belgian international Moussa Dembele is another who wasn't selected in the matchday squad to play Partizan
