Steve McManaman has praised Gareth Bale for an 'incredible' first season at Real Madrid.

The Welshman moved to the Spanish capital for a world record fee of £85million last summer but McManaman believes Bale has excelled in his new environment and will only get better.

The 42-year-old ex-Liverpool midfielder spent four years in the Spanish capital after signing for Real on a free transfer from Liverpool in 1999.

And he has
 been impressed with how Bale has performed following the huge price tag and all the hype that surrounded the world record 
move.

He said: 'I thought Gareth Bale had an incredible season, I really did.

'When you 
play for Real Madrid and when you go to Real Madrid with the price tag 
he went with, there was a huge amount of pressure on him.

'The
 fact that he contributed so much while not having the perfect run-in 
with not having pre-season and having niggly injuries and moving to a new country and  what not - his
 numbers were incredible.'

The
 Welshman scored 22 goals in 40 appearances for Los Blancos and won the 
Champions League and Copa del Rey - netting in both finals.

McManaman was speaking at the launch of the Lucozade Sport Conditions Zone at Canary Wharf in London.

The

face in their World Cup opener against Italy in Manaus on June 14.

McManaman continued: 'The fact Bale scored two goals in two finals and won two trophies, how could it have gone any better?'

'Apart
 from getting greedy and wanting to win the league and score a goal in 
every game like Cristiano (Ronaldo) does, I really don't think it does.

'I mean he scored 22 goals – 22 goals in your first season, that in itself is phenomenal.

'I
 think moving to a new country, trying to learn a new language, and 
trying to adapt to a new lifestyle – for a relatively quiet, shy lad – I
 think he’s had an amazing, amazing season.

'And
 I don’t think we’ve seen the best of him, that’s the thing. I think 
we’ll see an even better Gareth Bale once he’s fit, he’s rested and he’s
 had a full pre-season.'

The Conditions Zone - created by Lucozade, the official sports drink of the England team - recreates the conditions of Manaus by pumping in moisture and raising the temperature in its indoor arena at Canary Wharf. Teams can sign up to play for free and each player will be given an analysis by sport scientists and their personal information monitored by STATSports Technologies.
