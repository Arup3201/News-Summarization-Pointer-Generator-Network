Leaving: Vicky Featherstone, outgoing artistic director for the National Theatre of Scotland, said she has been 'bullied' for being English

The outgoing director of the National Theatre of Scotland has revealed she almost quit over anti-English ‘bullying’.

Vicky Featherstone set up the company from scratch, producing plays that travelled the world, including Black Watch and Alan Cumming’s one-man Macbeth.

But now, leaving the job after six years, she has spoken out about the antagonism she  experienced for being English.

The Surrey-born NTS artistic director is one of those attacked by Scots author Alasdair Gray this week as being a ‘colonist’, taking one of the best jobs north of the Border before returning to England.

However, she said this was not the first time critics had used her nationality against her when questioning her work and accusing her of ignoring traditional Scottish plays.

She said: ‘It really upset me because, as with all kinds of bullying, you don’t have a voice – so the hardest thing for me was that if people had criticised the programme, I could have defended it, but when people are criticising the programme because I am English, that is indefensible.’

She added: ‘I had a period – not long, because I am very strong – of a few weeks where I thought, “I cannot do this job, I don’t know how to do it”, that I wasn’t the right person for it, and I questioned myself because I didn’t know how to make decisions any more.’

Twitter was abuzz yesterday with support for the mother of two, who launched the NTS in 2006.

David Greig, whose play The Strange 
Undoing of Prudencia Hart is one of the theatre’s  success stories, 
said: ‘Alasdair Gray’s got it so wrong. What people give to Scottish 
culture has nothing to do with birthplace or length of residency.’

Critical praise: National Theatre of Scotland has produced many acclaimed plays which have travelled the world, including Black Watch, pictured, about Scottish soldiers in Afghanistan

Mark Cousins, a film critic who set up a mobile cinema to tour Scotland with actress Tilda Swinton, said: ‘As a Northern Irish person who’s lived in  Scotland for 30 years, I’ve always felt so welcome here. Until, that is, Alasdair Gray’s recent remarks.’

Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh said: 
‘There’s obviously a point to be made but the rhetoric deployed and the 
naming of individuals was just plain wrong.’

'Anti-English bully': Scottish artist Alasdair Gray

Independence supporter Mr Gray, 77, has conceded his comments might be interpreted as ‘anti-English prejudice’ but added that ‘these colonists were invited here and employed by Scots without confidence in their own land and people’.

He named Miss Featherstone, along with Chris Carrell, a former head of the Scottish Arts Council, and an unnamed director of arts funding agency Creative Scotland.

Miss Featherstone, who is leaving to join the Royal Court Theatre in London, did not realise at first that her English background would cause her problems.

‘I’m sure it was a thing from the beginning but nobody ever communicated it to me,’ she said. ‘It became a thing, interestingly, because people didn’t like my programming.

‘And rather than articulating that, it was easier to say the reason my programming was wrong for Scotland was because I am English and therefore don’t understand how to programme for Scotland.’

Newspaper stories, letters and journal articles increasingly focused on her Englishness.

But last year she created Staging the Nation, a series of events debating the traditional Scottish plays she had been accused of neglecting. She also met one of her fiercest critics, writer Paul Henderson Scott, and listened to his views.

She decided the comments would not force her out of her job, adding: ‘I always felt it was from a small group of people and did not actually represent the relationships that we had created around the rest of Scotland.’

She will be replaced at NTS by Laurie Sansom, former head of Royal & Derngate in Northampton – and also English.

He said: ‘Edinburgh is almost like a second home, as it is for most people who work in theatre, but yes, I will in some ways be coming to it with fresh eyes, which will have advantages and disadvantages.’
