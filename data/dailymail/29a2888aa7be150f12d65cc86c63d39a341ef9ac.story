Gus Poyet will ditch Sunderland’s policy of signing players en masse as he bids to bring in the ‘quality’ which will bump them up the Match of the Day running order.

The Black Cats have made 18 permanent signings in the last 18 months – the bulk of which came under the disastrous tenure of Paolo Di Canio – but only six of those remain part of the first-team picture.

In addition, loan arrivals such as Sebastian Coates and Ricky Alvarez have failed to impact and it has instead been long-serving players such as John O’ Shea, Lee Cattermole, Seb Larsson and Connor Wickham who have kept the team clear of danger.

But with five goalless draws already this season – the most in the Premier League – Poyet concedes that he needs to add some attacking flair come January.

When asked about the run of appearing at the tail end of Match of the Day, he said: ‘Not in a million years would I be happy going out in each game to earn a point.

‘We need to win. We need to score, we need to play better, we need to be more clinical and create more chances.’

In order to achieve that, Poyet is targeting offensive additions in the New Year, with former loanee Fabio Borini again on the radar amid his struggle for first-team football at Liverpool.

The Uruguayan – whose 14th-placed side entertain West Ham, in fourth, on Saturday afternoon - added: ‘It's quality or nothing, not quantity. Quantity at this club is finished.

‘We're not signing quantity any more. I don't want any more, “maybe if in three months’ time (they will come good)”. There were too many of those in the last three years and in the end the team suffers. You can't progress with too many changes.

‘The more players we bring in to certain positions, the better and easier it will be for me. We're not playing even 50 per cent of the way I want.’

Meanwhile, Poyet will come up against son Diego for the first time at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. The 19-year-old signed for the Hammers from Charlton during the summer and has been involved with Sam Allardyce’s senior side this season.

Poyet, though, has cut all contact to his boy for fear of compromising his loyalty.

‘I'm trying to stay away from him so there's no misunderstandings or any kind of doubts,’ he said.

‘It's not nice but it's only for a few days, it's not like I'm not going to talk to him anymore.

‘I think it's better not to call him or for him to call me. I think it's clear that it would have been uncomfortable for him as well, even a joke can be taken the wrong way.

‘Maybe he could read something into me asking a harmless question like “what have you done today?”.

‘Today, I don't care how he does, I don't care. We say in Spanish there are no friends on the pitch and no family ties either. I don't care. After the game, we're fine, but during it, no.’
