What's the worst part of your job? Long hours? Rubbish pay? Crazy bosses? Well spare a thought for poor model/designer/DJ Alexa Chung, who claims that free champagne is just the worst thing about working in fashion.

The 31-year-old fashionista was quizzed by i-D magazine on the perils of working in the world's most glamorous industry and rather than take the opportunity to talk about body image or the plight of underpaid factory workers, the brunette singled out the posh fizz given out at parties as her biggest gripe. 

'Do you know what? I really hate champagne,' she says in a video short for the publication. 'And my least favourite part of fashion is that that's the thing that they love to give out free at everything.'

Ever the pro: Alexa Chung has revealed that she hates champagne in an interview with i-D magazine

But before you panic that party-loving Alexa has jumped on the wagon, the IT girl confirms that spirits are more her kind of thing, adding: 'I always wish whisky was associated with beautiful dresses because then I'd be having a much better time.' 

And in the past single Alexa has said that Maker's Mark bourbon and Coke on the rocks 'as strong as you can make it' is her favourite tipple. 

Not again: The presenter is often expected to sup free champagne at events and parties

When asked to describe the style industry the Vogue writer, who introduces herself as a girl who 'stands in parties in outfits' for a living, tells i-D that it is ridiculous: 'The fashion industry is just like Zoolander if Zoolander was a documentary,' she says. 

But for youngsters still wanting to make it in the ultra-competitive world of fashion she offers some sage advice: 'Find your voice and have a unique perspective on things. Have a clear vision that's new and fresh.'

Or failing that, she says, be so 'slamming hot' that you just get to be there. Works for some...
