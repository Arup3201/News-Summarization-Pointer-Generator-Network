Brian Williams has announced he is temporarily stepping down as anchor of the NBC Nightly News.

The 55-year-old Managing Editor of the United States' most watched network news program said in a statement Saturday he has become 'too much a part of the news'.

He  added: 'I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. 

'Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us.'

A source told the DailyMail.com Williams will not be involved in any of the day-to-day editing of the program during his absence.  

The scandal unfolded after the broadcaster admitted his personal account of an RPG attack on his helicopter in Iraq was false.

Holt, who hosted the weekend edition of the Nightly News on Saturday, mentioned the news about his colleague and read out a statement. However he did not elaborate and didn't mention the fact he will be taking over.

Brian Williams has announced he is temporarily stepping down from his job as anchor at NBC Nightly News 

Williams has also been accused of fabricating elements of his time in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.

While reporting on the ground he said he saw a body floating down the street, and caught dysentery from flood water.

As a result of the controversy, the veteran journalist is at risk from rivals who want his job, according to the New York Daily News.

Former NBC presenter, and current Yahoo! News personality Katie Couric, had been linked with the role, but a spokesman ruled her out on Saturday.

Williams confessed that he 'made a mistake recalling' a flight he took on a Chinook helicopter over Iraq in 2003.

'Made a mistake recalling': Williams, shown left in Iraq and right in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, has found his claims met with scrutiny

In the midst of a career spent covering and consuming news, it has become painfully apparent to me that I am presently too much a part of the news, due to my actions.'

As Managing Editor of NBC Nightly News, I have decided to take myself off of my daily broadcast for the next several days, and Lester Holt has kindly agreed to sit in for me to allow us to adequately deal with this issue. 

Upon my return, I will continue my career-long effort to be worthy of the trust of those who place their trust in us.

He has previously said the aircraft he was on was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade that miraculously didn't explode, and managed to land with no loss of life.

In the most extreme version of the tale, told to David Letterman in March 2013, he said: 'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire, including the one I was in, RPG and AK-47.'  

In fact, he was on a different aircraft entirely, which by some accounts was as much as an hour behind the one helicopter which was actually hit.

He recanted his account after being called out by veterans who really were on the chopper.

NBC has launched an official probe into Williams, lead by Richard Esposito, its top investigative journalist.

Since the apology, questions were also raised about statements Williams made on coverage of Hurricane Katrina, which was one of his proudest moments at NBC.

He claimed to see a body floating down the street in the French Quarter of New Orleans, past the Ritz-Carlton hotel where he was staying.

Sore spot: Williams's Friday broadcast opened with an exclusive story from Iraq - the country from which Williams's much-maligned error stemmed

In a 2006 interview he referenced the moment: 'When you look out of your hotel room window in the French Quarter and watch a man float by face down, when you see bodies that you last saw in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, and swore to yourself that you would never see in your country'.

Some are sceptical of the story, as the French Quarter was not extensively flooded in the disaster, bringing into question whether there would have been enough water for a body to float down the street.

He has also claimed that flood water gave him dysentery, which medics have said was not prevalent during Katrina.

Nonetheless, Williams's top two items tonight were on the very subjects under most scrutiny. He led the broadcast with a story from the struggle with ISIS in Iraq, then moved on to the impact of extreme weather in America, included flooding in California. 

As well as the internal probe, the Daily News also reported that 'a secret task-force' from the rival ABC network is also dredging up old footage of Williams in the hope of finding more claims which do not withstand scrutiny.

According to the newspaper, Ben Sherwood, the president of Disney-ABC Television Group, ordered the task-force himself - but the network has strongly denied such a group exists.

The News also outlined another threat allegedly closing in on Williams - his former NBC colleague Katie Couric, now a big-name anchor at Yahoo! Global News.

A source told the paper: 'Katie still has deep, deep contacts at NBC. She would love to return as the Nightly News anchor... She wants to be back in the big leagues again.'

Others denied she had designs on the NBC top spot.

Replacement: Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline

Lester Holt anchors the weekend editions of NBC's Today show and Dateline.

The 55-year-old also hosts the weekend edition of the Nightly News.  

He has already spent time in the role he is taking over - having covered for Williams when he was having knee replacement surgery in August 2013.

Holt's first job was as a DJ for a Country and Western station during college. 

Hoping for a career in the entertainment industry, he soon discovered he could only get a full-time job if he reported the news.

The broadcaster spent 19 years with CBS beginning in 1981, when he was hired as a reporter for WCBS-TV in New York City. 

In August 2005, he assumed full-time duties at NBC News, where he became a substitute anchor for NBC Nightly News and Today. 

He then became a full-time co-anchor of Weekend Today following the death of his predecessor David Bloom.

In September 2012 he faced embarrassment after turning up late to a Saturday morning show, because he overslept.

Holt took to Twitter to alert viewers of his frazzled morning.

'For the first time in 9 yrs of hosting weekend @todayshow I overslept!' he posted on his Twitter account.

The executive producer for the show ended up giving Holt a wake-up call at 5:45 a.m and he made a mad dash from his apartment, in the Flatiron District in New York City, to 30 Rock in midtown Manhattan where the show goes live at 7:00 a.m.

He took the lead role during NBC's coverage of the London Olympics in 2012.

And sleep also proved to be scarce for him during his stint across the pond.

He was enjoying a nap on a train ride from London to Alnmouth, in the north of England, when he overslept, missed his stop and ended up in Scotland on August 7.

He had to change trains four times over a time span of nine hours to get back where he needed to be.

But in his typical good humor, the newsman joked about the incident and shared it with his fans over Twitter.

'If ya gotta end up in the wrong place u can do worse than Edinburgh. Catching some quick sights,' he tweeted, adding that on his return trip he would be 'drinking LOTS of coffee.' 

During the coverage of the Sochi Winter Oylimpics in 2014, he downed a shot of vodka with co-host Natalie Morales.
