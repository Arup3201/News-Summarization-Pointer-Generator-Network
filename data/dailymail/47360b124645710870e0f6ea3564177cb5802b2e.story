When it comes to dealing with embarrassing little brothers, Prince William knows a thing or two – after suffering the headline grabbing antics of the party-loving Prince Harry.

So he may well be dishing out some sage advice to his wife the Duchess of Cambridge about how to cope after this set of pictures emerged of her brother at play.

The madcap snapshots prove that James Middleton, 26, has a wicked sense of fun that would no doubt appeal to Harry – but which may well have other members of the Royal Family, not least Kate, recoiling in horror.

His 'n' hers: James Middleton, pictured left with sister Kate, is on his best behaviour in a smart jacket as he attends a function, but, right, is transformed in a navy-blue polka-dot dress for a party at Edinburgh University

Macho man: James, right, strikes a rugged pose with hardy friends after a New Year's Day dip in the North Sea

One picture shows James looking the worse for wear in the ski resort of Tignes, apparently dozing on a nightclub pole.

Another sees him at a freshers’ party at Edinburgh University striking a pose in a navy-blue polka-dot dress that could almost have been taken straight out of Kate’s wardrobe.

Most of the pictures demonstrate James’s love of action and the outdoors, a fondness shared by Kate and their sister Pippa.

And he is clearly not shy, as  the snaps of him emerging from the sea prove.

Making hay: The 26-year-old emerges gurning from a stack of straw as he enjoys some farmyard high jinks

In times gone by, the photographs may have been seen as immensely compromising for a Royal in-law, yet like all well-connected young people these days, James has lived most of his adult life through the lens of social media websites such as Facebook, where images of parties, holidays – and embarrassing moments – are stored and freely shared.

But are James’s carefree days already over? 

He is dating socialite Donna Air, 34, who has a daughter, and friends say that he has matured rapidly and is focusing hard on making a success of his baking company, Nice Cakes.

At least Kate knows that her brother can be  relied upon to behave in a totally respectable and mature way when needed – he performed a perfect Bible reading at her wedding in 2011.
