Victim: Chef Henry Stangroom, 21, was stabbed to death by his flatmate Andrew Morris

A brilliant financier killed his girlfriend’s brother after she dumped him and ordered him to delete a sex tape, a court was told.

Andrew Morris, 30, fatally stabbed his 21-year-old flatmate Henry Stangroom after spending months in a blur of alcohol and cocaine.

The victim’s sister, Michelle, had told him she would not see him again unless he returned to his £120,000-a-year job, the Old Bailey heard.

The actuary had gone on sick leave for five months after suffering panic attacks during a £200million deal with finance giant Goldman Sachs.

She also ordered him to destroy a sex tape they had made on his mobile phone during a visit to the flat he shared with her brother in Battersea, South West London.

She was worried after a friend had been involved in a scandal involving England rugby player James Haskell, in which a couple were filmed secretly.

Highly-qualified Morris, who worked as a risk assessor handling huge business deals, killed Mr Stangroom three days later.

The young successful chef, who worked at the Criterion, in Piccadilly Circus, was stabbed repeatedly in the heart, lungs and head.

Morris was later found in the bathroom after attempting suicide, with wounds to both wrists and a harpoon spear in his neck.

He admits killing his friend, but claims he was mentally ill at the time after suffering from severe depression and the impact of his drug and alcohol abuse.

Miss Stangroom had moved out of the flat she shared with Morris and her brother six weeks before the attack.

Morris said she told him she was concerned a tape they had made could cause similar problems as it did for Mr Haskell, former captain of the England under 18s.

The rugby player was suspended from Wellington College after one of his friend’s was filmed having sex with his girlfriend on a camera planted in a dormitory cupboard.

‘She asked me to dispose of similar material we had made,’ Morris told the court. It was a tape. It was made on my mobile phone.

‘She said her friend had got into hot water making a similar tape with this England rugby player.’

Later, Morris sobbed as he claimed a furious row was behind the killing.

He said he stabbed Mr Stangroom while defending himself after taunting him over a fatal road tragedy some time earlier.

Mr Stangroom had killed 19-year-old Jack Bland as he drove to his family home in Odiham, Hampshire, after a wedding reception.

The chef assumed he had hit a deer and drove on with a smashed windscreen. He was later given a suspended sentence for dangerous driving.

Morris said the victim told him he would not let him ruin his sister’s life as they argued and stalked each other around the flat.

He told the jury: ‘I said it wasn’t me who ruined lives, it was him. I was referring to the accident he had. I went into the kitchen. I got hit on the back of the head.’

'As he came towards me I put the knife up in front of me and pushed it towards him. I wanted him to stop stabbing at me'

Morris then claimed the victim lashed out with a knife, inflicting a cut on his arm as he ran to the bedroom to get help.

‘It was my fault. I said some things that I shouldn’t have said. I probably said the most hurtful thing I could ever have said to him,’ Morris said.

He grabbed the spear gun before the pair grappled again and Morris said he picked up a second knife to defend himself.

‘As he came towards me I put the knife up in front of me and pushed it towards him. I wanted him to stop stabbing at me,’ he said.

It was then that the chef was fatally injured, said Morris, and he claims to have tried to stop the bleeding as he gave his friend mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Morris said he intended to kill himself by slashing his wrists, but simply ended up sitting in the hot water for two hours.

He then put the spear gun under his chin and used his toe to fire it. However, it did not inflict a fatal wound and he was later found by paramedics.

The jury has heard how Morris’ life spiralled into depression after he went on sick leave from his job in the City.

The father-of-one became a recluse, spending months inside his flat drinking up to two bottles of wine a day, inhaling nitrous oxide and snorting cocaine.

Morris gradually spent all his money and in the end could not afford to pay his bills and his credit was so bad he was refused a pay-day loan.

He attempted suicide several times and once slashed his wrists and sat in the bath fully clothed while his brother and best friend were in the flat.

In the weeks before the killing he Googled ‘murder mental illness’ and ‘sentence for murder in UK’ but told the jury they were linked to a TV show he was watching.

Morris, of St Neots, Cambridgeshire, denies murder. The trial continues.
