Apple has opened up its Chinese factories to independent examiners after claims that workers were subjected to appalling sweatshop conditions. 

The technology giant announced yesterday that members of the Washington-based Fair Labour Association would be checking the factories where iPads and iPhones are assembled. 

The team of observers began their inspections yesterday at Foxconn City in Shenzhen, China, a complex that employs and houses hundreds of thousands of workers.

According to reports, some Apple workers in China had to work 15-hour days for as little as £27-a-month.

As many as 100 workers have been injured by toxic chemical exposures and audits have revealed under age employees and examples of pay being withheld as punishment.

Apple said it has asked the anti-sweatshop group to carry out the ‘special voluntary audits.'

‘We believe that workers everywhere have the right to a safe and fair work environment, which is why we’ve asked the FLA to independently assess the performance of our largest suppliers,’ Apple chief executive Tim Cook said yesterday. 

‘The inspections now under way are unprecedented in the electronics industry, both in scale and scope,’ he added.

Foxconn City is a unit of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Company which employs up to 1.1million people in a series of huge factory complexes in China.

Apple shares hit an all-time high as the company announced it would investigate the alleged ‘sweat shop’ conditions in its supplier’s factories.

The shares broke through the $500 mark in early trading in New York yesterday, equivalent to £317 each.

It values the electronics monolith at just shy of £300billion ($460billion) - making it the most valuable company in the world.

It comes just seven months after shares topped the $400 mark.

The New York Times claimed last month that Apple found ‘consistent violations’ of its code of conduct after inspecting 396 of its facilities.

‘The workers assembling iPhones and iPads…work excessive overtime.

'Some say they stand so long that their legs swell until they can hardly walk,’ said the Times.

In 2009, a Foxconn employee fell or jumped from an apartment building after losing an iPhone prototype.

Over the next two years, at least 18 other Foxconn workers were linked to attempted suicides.

Despite claims to the contrary, the abuses appear to have continued.

Last month, 150 Foxconn employees 
threatened to leap from a three-story building after claiming of poor 
pay and pressurised working conditions.

The Chinese company – which also manufactures items for Sony, Nintendo and Hewlett Packard - has disputed allegations of back-to-back shifts and crowded living conditions. But the suppliers have agreed to give ‘unrestricted’ access to their plants, said Apple.

2010: 137 workers at Suzhou facility, owned by Apple suppliers Wintek, injured by poisonous chemical, n-hexane, used to clean iPhone screens because it dried faster.

May 2011: Four workers dead and 18  injured in dust explosion at Foxconn factory in Chengdu, which produces iPad parts.

December 2011: 61 workers injured in gas explosion at Riteng Computer Accessory Co factory in Shanghai, which was trialling aluminium iPad 2 back panels.

A month ago, the California-based firm took the step of becoming the first technology company to become a member of the non-profit Fair Labour Association, a group of businesses and universities focused on improving working conditions around the world.

The FLA plans to interview thousands of employees at several Apple suppliers. The audits will cover facilities where more than 90per cent of Apple products are put together.

The findings will be posted on the website www.fairlabor.org in early March.

But campaign group for Chinese workers, China Labour Watch, criticised Apple for just conducting a public relations exercise.

In an open letter to Mr Cook last week it demanded Apple accept lower profits so suppliers can raise wages, employ more staff and invest in improving safety.

And group activist Fan Yuan said: 'We already know what the conditions are like in the factories.

'What Apple needs to do right now is take action to solve the problems. This move is not really about solving the problems, but rather about Apple getting publicity and rebuilding its positive image.'
