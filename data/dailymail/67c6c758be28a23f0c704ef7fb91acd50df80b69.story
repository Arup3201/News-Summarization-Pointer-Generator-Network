Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o had conversations with hoaxer Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, who was posing as the footballer's fake online girlfriend Lennay Kekua.

The footballer had intimate conversations with Tuiasosopo, which were said to have cemented the relationship despite the pair never meeting.

Lawyer Milton Grimes said the footballer 'thought it was a female he was talking with'. He added: 'It was Ronaiah as Lennay.'

Duped: Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o training at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. A lawyer claims the footballer had phone conversations with a hoaxer pretending to be his girlfriend

Tuiasosopo is thought to have invented Lennay based on stolen pictures of Diane O’Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo.

Mr Grimes added: 'This wasn’t a prank to make fun. It was establishing a communication with someone.

'It was a person with a troubled existence trying to reach out and communicate and have a relationship.'

According to reports, Tuiasosopo's CV includes vocal and dramatic training, while he was president of his high school drama club and performs with a Christian band.

Mr Grimes insisted that former high school football star Tuiasosopo, 22, was not trying to hurt or humiliate Te’o.

The Notre Dame footballer was pictured running football drills at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.

Te'o says he has been the victim of an online hoax after claiming to have an online girlfriend who later turned out to be a fake.

Posing: Lawyer Milton Grimes said the linebacker thought he was talking to fictitious online girlfriend Lennay Kekua, who was posing as Ronaiah Tuiasosopo

He was interviewed by Katie Couric yesterday, telling her that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend, after discovering she didn't exist.

But he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax.

Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed that the girlfriend, called Lennay Kekua, had died of cancer.

'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said.

He replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12.'

Breaking down: Manti Te'o  appears to have cried during the interview which will air in full on Thursday

One-on-one: The interview took place on Tuesday, but will not be aired in full until Thursday

A segment of the interview with Te'o and his parents was broadcast on Good Morning America on Wednesday.

The Heisman Trophy runner-up said he only learned of the hoax when he received a phone call in December from a woman saying she was Kekua.

'Now I get a phone call on December 
6, saying that she's alive and then I'm going be put on national TV two 
days later. And to ask me about the same question. You know, what would 
you do?' Te'o said.

But reports suggested that he discussed the girlfriend in a Web interview on December 8 
and again in a newspaper interview published December 10.

Supportive: Te'o's parents Brian and Ottilla Te'o were also featured during the interview

Te'o's
father defended his son when Couric pointed out that many people don't 
believe the football star, suspecting he used the situation for personal
gain.

'People can 
speculate about what they think he is. I've known him 21 years of his 
life. And he's not a liar. He's a kid,' Brian Te'o said with tears in 
his eyes.

Unmasked: Diane O'Meara told NBC's Today show that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo used pictures of her without her knowledge in creating a fake woman called Lennay Kekua

On Tuesday, the woman whose photo was used as the 'face' of the Twitter account of Te'o's supposed girlfriend says the man allegedly behind the hoax confessed and apologized to her.

Diane O'Meara told NBC's Today show that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo used pictures of her without her knowledge in creating a fake woman called Lennay Kekua.

Pictures that Miss O'Meara had posted on Facebook and Instagram were used in the elaborate hoax, which she says is a case of identity theft.

She added: 'It's very bizarre and it's a very twisted and confusing scenario.'

'In the past five years, [Tuiasosopo has] literally been stalking my Facebook and stealing my photos.'

While Tuiasosopo has since called her
and expressed regret over the situation she was thrown into, Miss 
O'Meara says there's little he can do to make it better.

'Ronaiah
has called and I know he has confessed but he has also apologized. But I
don't think there’s anything he can say to me that would fix this.'

The New York Daily News reports
that Manti Te'o apparently also found the receipt for 
36-long-stem white roses that he sent to the girl's supposed funeral, 
and he hopes that that proves he was not in on the scam.

'My
dearest Lennay, although our time together was brief, I feel like I’ve 
known you all of my life. Till we meet again. I love you, Manti,' he 
wrote in the note that 1-800-FLOWERS attached to the bouquet.

Fake and original: The picture used by the 
hoaxers as the face of Lennay Kekua, left, was taken from this original 
photograph of Diane O'Meara, 23, a marketing executive living in Los 
Angeles

Fake: The Twitter account of Lennay Kekua with Diane's pictures has been exposed as completely false

The highly-anticipated interview will technically be the second time that Te'o has spoken publicly since the scandal broke, but it will be the first time that he does so on television.

The standout football player gave an off-camera interview with ESPN on Friday night that reportedly lasted for more than two-and-a-half hours.

He insists he was the victim of the hoax, not a participant.

He
admitted it was 'crazy' that he had a purely online relationship with a
girl but denied he was part of the con to gain publicity for his 
burgeoning football career at the college.

Facing the truth: Manti Te'o, who has had just one interview since the news broke that his girlfriend was a hoax, will sit down with Katie Couric in a show airing Thursday

'No. Never,' Te'o said in an interview Friday night with ESPN's Jeremy Schaap, 'I wasn't faking it. I wasn't part of this.'

The Heisman Trophy runner-up said he had an online romance with a woman he never met and in September was informed that the woman died from leukemia.

Te'o told ESPN that the person suspected of being the mastermind of the hoax has contacted him and apologized.
