Former Birmingham City striker Christian Benitez has tragically died of suspected heart failure at the age of 27.

The Ecuador international's death comes just a few weeks after his £10million switch to Qatari side El Jaish from Mexican team Club America.

As
footballers across the world took to Twitter to voice their grief at 
news of his death, the Ecuadorian Football Federation revealed he was 
rushed to hospital yesterday with 'severe stomach pain' before he died 
from a heart attack.

In a
statement on its website, the EFA said: '[Benitez] had severe stomach 
pain and was rushed to a hospital where, after a few hours, suffered 
cardio-respiratory arrest, which ended his life.'

They
added: 'The Ecuadorian Football Federation extends its heartfelt note 
of sympathy to the family members, parents, wife, children and friends 
of our striker Cristian Benitez.'

El Jaish also released a statement confirming the news. It said: 'The club would like to offer its sincere condolences to the family of the player.

'Benitez had recently joined the club from Club America for three seasons.

'The player participated for the first time with the team during yesterday's match against Qatar Sports Club in the Sheikh Jassem Cup without complaining of any health problems.

'His sudden departure is a big shock for each member of the technical and administrative staff.

'He was a player that over the short period he was here was regarded for his high moral character.'

A tweet from Club America read: 'You left as a champion, you will always be in our hearts. Rest in Peace Christian Benitez.'

He was diagnosed with appendicitis, but - according to his father-in-law Cleber Chala - this developed into peritonitis and complications led to a respiratory arrest.

Mr Chala, who spoke on Ecuadorian radio and cited by The Mirror, said: 'They called me at 3am to tell me that they had taken him to hospital as an emergency due to stomach pains.

'When he arrived, he was not seen to quickly.

'By the time he was admitted he was no longer responding. This happened in Qatar, my daughter is alone there.'

Benitez, nicknamed 'Chucho', was on loan at St. Andrew's for the 2009-10 season, making 36 appearances for the Blues. He won 58 caps for Ecuador, including appearances at the 2006 World Cup.

pay his respects, including posting a touching photo of the pair 
together.

As tributes for 
Benitez from around the game began to pour in, it became clear that the 
striker had an impact on team-mates during his short time in Birmingham.

Former
Blues star Craig Gardner, who now plays for Sunderland, took to his Twitter account to register his 
condolences, posting: 'Can't believe Christian Benitez aka chucho has 
died had the pleasure to play with him he was a top bloke. My thoughts 
go out to his family.'

The club also tweeted, saying: 'RIP Christian 'Chucho' Benitez. Forever in our hearts.

'The
thoughts of all at Birmingham City Football Club are with the friends 
and family of Chucho following this very sad news. #RIP'

The midlands side also revealed plans to commemorate Benitez in their opening Championship game at home to Watford.

Monaco's £52million star signing Falcao also posted his condolences in Spanish.

Football has been blighted by heart conditions hitting seemingly healthy young players.

Fabrice Muamba, 25, was forced to retire from the game after collapsing on the pitch from a cardiac arrest in March last year at Tottenham’s White Hart Lane ground.

The former England Under-21 midfielder was effectively dead for 78 minutes when his heart stopped beating during an FA Cup match for Bolton at Tottenham.

Just a month later an Italian footballer collapsed on the pitch and died from a heart attack in front of horrified teammates and supporters.

Former under 21 international Piermario Morosini, 25, who played for Livorno, was seen to tremble before falling to his knees and never regained consciousness.

The heart defect that most commonly kills young athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

There are a number of congenital heart defects that can hit sportsmen. The one which most commonly kills young athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

A genetic defect, it causes part of the heart muscle to thicken in about one in 500 people. It is most serious in the young and is exacerbated by exercise.

In some countries, such as Italy, screening for this condition is mandatory for footballers and sufferers are not allowed to play. But in Britain it is up to individual clubs.

Other, less common possible causes of sudden cardiac arrest include ARVD, another disorder of the heart muscle which causes part of it to turn to fat; faults with the heart’s electrical impulses; irregular rhythms; or defective heart valves.

The FA has made more than 900 defibrillators available to Premier League and Football League clubs.
