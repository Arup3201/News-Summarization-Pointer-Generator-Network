For nearly a decade, Denise Scott believed her husband had been killed on impact when United Airlines Flight 175 smashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.

But last year, just weeks before the 10-year anniversary of the horrific attack, she received a call that changed her life - and the story of her husband's death.

A note in his handwriting and with a smudge of his blood had been found, reading: '84th floor. West Office. 12 people trapped.'

Found: Randy Scott wrote a note, '84th floor, west office, 12 people trapped', before the south tower collapsed on 9/11. It also shows a smudge of his blood. His family thought he had died on impact

The note had drifted to the ground outside the building just moments before it collapsed - and left Randy Scott's wife and three children horrified that he had been alive to experience fear.

'I spent 10 years hoping that Randy wasn't trapped in that building,' Denise, 57, told the Stamford Advocate from her Stamford, Connecticut home.

'You don't want them to suffer. They're 
trapped in a burning building. It's just an unspeakable horror. And then
 you get this 10 years later. It just changes everything.'

Scott, 48, worked at Euro Brokers Inc. in the World Trade Center when he phoned the school where his wife taught to let her know that one of the Twin Towers had been hit by a plane.

Believing the first crash was minor, he 
asked to pass on the message that he was fine - and she only 
discovered the full horror when her daughter Rebecca called from college later that morning.

Loss: Randy Scott, 48, perished with his co-workers and thousands of others when the towers collapsed

In the days after the attacks, Denise 
and her three daughters checked bars, restaurants and hospitals for 
their husband and father, the Advocate reported.

Nearly 10 years later, in August 2011, Denise received a call from Dr. Barbara Butcher, chief of staff and director of Forensic Investigations at the  Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York.

Aware that the office called families if they came across fragments of victims, Denise asked what it was they had found.

'She said, "No, it's not a fragment. It's something written",' Denise said. 'And that's when I just fell apart.'

The
 note had been found on the street amid the chaos on 9/11 and handed to a
 guard at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As he reached for his 
radio to alert help, the tower crumbled.

The Federal Reserve kept the note and eventually turned it over to the National September 11 Memorial & 
Museum, which worked with the medical examiner's office.

It
 was linked to Randy Scott after a medical examiner carried out DNA 
tests on a dark spot on the note, and discovered it was Scott's blood.

After taking the phone call from the 
Medical Examiner's office, Denise travelled to New York with Randy's 
best friend to see the note.

'The minute I saw it I didn't need to see the DNA test,' she said. 'I saw the handwriting. It's Randy's handwriting.'

Shock: The women said they never wanted to believe he had been trapped or suffered in the building

She added: 'I'm speechless that they actually 
were able to identify it. This note was written on 
September 11. It came out of a window. Somebody had it. People had their
 hands all over it.'

Butcher
 from the Medical Examiner's office asked if the museum could exhibit 
the letter and Denise agreed - but asked for them to keep it quiet until
 she told her daughters.

But
 the months passed and the girl returned to college, and Denise 
struggled to find the right moment, she told the Advocate. When her 
father died in January, she realised it was time.

Her daughters, Rebecca, Alexandra, and Jessica, were stunned to hear of the note.

'I was bawling, because I recognised his handwriting,' Rebecca, 29, recalled. 'I thought he was killed instantly.'

Alexandra, 22, added: 'Everyone hoped that it was right on 
impact. That he didn't suffer.'

Impact: United Airlines Flight 175 smashed into the south tower of the 
World Trade Center hitting near to where Randy worked at Euro Brokers 
Inc. He survived to write a note - before the tower collapsed

Fallen: The note was found among the debris at the bottom of the towers and eventually passed to the Medical Examiner's office, which carried out DNA tests on the blood and matched it to Scott's

They had hoped the same for his 
colleagues, too, she said, who also had children and families. The 
Scotts began reaching out to other relatives of those killed alongside 
Randy, to tell them the truth.

Denise said that although it changed their knowledge of that day for the worse, she is so thankful she found out the truth - while other families have chosen not to be notified when fragments are found.

Jan Ramirez, chief curator of the museum, told the Advocate: 'It's so amazing to think that Randy 
Scott wrote it and it eventually ended up with his wife and three 
daughters, which is an amazing arc of a day.

'We are incredibly proud to be able to show it and I think it 
will be one of the most powerful artifacts in the museum.'

After the 2001 attacks on New York City, the Office 
of the Chief Medical Examiner had to contend with thousands of bodies, 
many completely shattered and unrecognisable, buried among the wreckage 
of the crumbled buildings.

A huge 1.8million tons was eventually moved to a landfill for workers to
 start sifting through, in the hopes of making positive IDs on the nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks.

Nearly 11 years on, a small group of scientists are still desperately working to give grieving families the justice they crave.

More than 9,000 pieces of bone, 
some the size of just a Tic Tac, are kept at Memorial Park, a building 
on 30th Street in Manhattan, New York Magazine reported last year.

Five dedicated staff inexhaustibly sift through crushed remains of bone taken from the scene day after day, cross-referencing any clues they get with DNA samples from the victims' families.

Last year, just two IDs were made, leaving 1,121 victims still unidentified. So far, the office has identified less than 60 per cent of the 2,753 people who died on 9/11.

Just 17 of the remains were identified by sight alone, 305 were determined by fingerprints, 25 by photographs, 78 by personal effects, 534 by dental or body X-rays and six by tattoos.

The work also involves profiling the DNA of the victims to match against the bones. Samples were collected by taking DNA from toothbrushes or by swabbing living relatives.

Even though it is painstaking, families have praised the work as vital.

Jim Riches, a former deputy chief of the FDNY who lost his son on 9/11, told the magazine: 'We recovered my son March 25, 2002 but it wasn't all of him. I would want to bring all his parts back to Queens and put them all in one place.'
