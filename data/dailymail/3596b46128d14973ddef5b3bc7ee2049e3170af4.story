A grandfather says he could have had a heart attack after an energy giant mistakenly sent him a power bill demanding £8,275.

Rob Gray, of Westley, Suffolk, was sent the bill for 30 times the amount he usually pays Scottish Power for his electricity.

Repeated attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful and the 66-year-old was then sent an email demanding he pay up.

The company has finally admitted its mistake and apologised to the pensioner for the blunder.

Rob Gray was left furious after it took Scottish Power weeks to sort out an £8,275 bill he was sent last month

Retired taxi driver Mr Gray received the initial request, covering a period of under six months, on December 5.

Mr Gray, of Westley, Suffolk, said: 'I tried to ring them, but couldn't get through. I tried booking a call back but none were available.

'Eventually I emailed them and they sent me the response saying they would phone within 10 days. They never did.'

His worries were made worse when he then got an email demanding 'prompt payment'.

He said: 'I  tried everything to get in touch with them. That email was the point at which I thought "that's enough".

'You would think someone at some point would have looked at the bill and noticed something was not right.

'I have had a few sleepless nights over this. It's not that I think I will have to pay it, but it is frustrating. I'm on heart pills - and this kind of bill could give you a heart attack.

'I would normally expect to pay £250 to £300 over the winter period, but this is mad. I don't even think a small business could use this much.'

The amount - which is 30 times his usual bill - was caused by an IT problem at the huge energy firm

Mr Gray has now finally received an apology from Scottish Power.

The electricity giant told Mr Gray that IT problems were to blame for the bungle and said his 'delayed' bill would be sent shortly.

'My bill was not delayed, it was just completely wrong,' Mr Gray said: 'They have not recognised that at all.'

An error in the estimated night time reading put the total usage for the period at 99,057kwh, compared to the equivalent last year of just 3,331kwh.

A spokesman for Scottish Power, which reported profits of £184million last year, said the company had launched an urgent investigation into the mistake.

It is not the first time the energy giant has bombarded a customer with electricity bills.

Earlier this year, Tina Jones, from Bridgnorth in Shropshire, received a series of energy bills for her terraced cottage holiday home in Gwynedd, North West Wales.

The livery yard owner had sleepless nights for three months after Scottish Power bombarded her with energy bills for her countryside bolt-hole. 

In June, she received a statement telling her she owed just over £12. This was par for the course given she only uses the storage heaters in winter and makes monthly payments of £28 set by the energy firm.

But in early September, out of the blue, she received a statement for a staggering £6,861.04. 

Calls to Scottish Power to resolve the issue resulted in Ms Jones, 66, receiving eight further statements between September 23 and December 3. On three occasions, she received two bills with the same statement date but for different amounts.

At the time, the firm told The Mail on Sunday it would be issuing Ms Jones and her husband Norman with an updated bill and agreed to make a goodwill payment for the error.
