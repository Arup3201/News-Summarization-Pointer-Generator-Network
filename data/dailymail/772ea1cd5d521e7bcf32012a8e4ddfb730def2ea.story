Women who live in fear of breast cancer coming back may be able to beat the disease by taking a drug for ten years after surgery, say doctors.

Using tamoxifen for ten rather than five years halves the risk of women dying from the most common kind of breast cancer, according to a study – described as a 'pivotal moment' in the fight against the disease.

The study looked at the benefits for women with tumours fuelled by the female hormone oestrogen – who account for three out of four patients – and found those taking tamoxifen for longer than the recommended five years are better protected against recurrence and are less likely to die from the disease.

Benefits: Taking tamoxifen for ten years after surgery halves the risk of the most common kind of breast cancer

Dr Julia Wilson, of Breakthrough 
Breast Cancer, said: 'These findings are extremely exciting. Tamoxifen 
is a well-established and cheap treatment.'

The Cancer Research UK trial involved 
almost 7,000 women with breast cancer who, after five years of taking 
tamoxifen, either continued taking the drug for another five years or 
stopped treatment.

Among women who took tamoxifen for ten
years, 25 per cent fewer had recurrences of breast cancer and 23 per 
cent fewer died, compared to those who took the drug for just five 
years.

The research was presented yesterday 
at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago.

Dr 
Daniel Rea, clinical lead researcher based at the University of 
Birmingham, said: 'These results are important as they establish that 
giving tamoxifen for longer than the current standard of five years 
significantly cuts the risk of breast cancer returning.

'Doctors are now likely to recommend 
continuing tamoxifen for an extra five years and this will result in 
many fewer breast cancer recurrences and breast cancer deaths worldwide.
Tamoxifen is cheap and widely available so this could have an immediate
impact.'

Despite its benefits, tamoxifen does 
have side effects, including some similar to menopausal symptoms, such 
as night sweats and hot flushes.

Rare but serious side effects include 
increased risk of endometrial cancer – cancer of the lining of the womb –
blood clots, and stroke.

Professor Richard Gray, based at the 
University of Oxford and presenting the findings in Chicago, said: 'This
study establishes that the benefits of taking tamoxifen for longer 
greatly outweigh the risks.'

Side effects: Although tamoxifen helps with breast cancer prevention, it can create symptoms similar to the menopause

Cancer specialist Professor Michael 
Baum was involved in the first trials on tamoxifen three decades ago.

He
said: 'This trial is very encouraging news for women. My group was the 
first to report the benefits of tamoxifen in 1983

'It's wonderful that 
30 years later, we have the proof that the benefits last even longer 
than we could have anticipated.'

Professor Baum added that doctors were
likely to offer the drug to more women after they had completed a 
five-year course of treatment after surgery – because many were asking 
for it.

He said: 'They are often very 
reluctant to come off it after five years.

'It becomes a psychological 
crutch that has helped them through a very difficult time, and now we 
have the evidence to say with confidence that if they want to continue, 
there are definite advantages.'  

Katherine Woods, of Breast Cancer 
Campaign, said: 'These findings herald a pivotal moment for one of the 
key weapons in the fight against breast cancer.

'We are delighted that 
this drug, one of the most significant in the history of breast cancer 
treatment, can have an even greater effect in preventing it from 
returning if women take it for longer.'

The Chicago conference also heard that
British researchers have discovered that a handful of so-called 
'superfoods' can help fight prostate cancer.

A six-month trial involving 203 men 
with prostate cancer found that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 
of those who took a capsule containing essence of pomegranate, green 
tea, turmeric and broccoli were 63 per cent lower than those who did 
not.

PSA is a level of the protein produced by the prostate gland which 
is an indicator of prostate cancer.

Professor Robert Thomas, a consultant 
oncologist at Addenbrooke and Bedford hospitals, said: 'We hope this 
will help millions of men to help combat the onset of prostate cancer.'
