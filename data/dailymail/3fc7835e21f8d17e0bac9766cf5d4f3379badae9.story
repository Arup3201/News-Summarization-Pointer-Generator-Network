The failure of Britain’s school system is putting huge strain on society by forcing businesses to turn to millions of foreign workers to fill low-skilled jobs.

Too many school leavers lack even the most basic skills to ‘look people in the eye and get out of bed’, according to immigration experts.

They are also given little incentive to work by the benefits system, the government-appointed Migration Advisory Committee claimed.

As a result, businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas who are better qualified, more reliable, confident and – unlike young Britons – have the good ‘manners’ needed to work in shops.

However, MAC said there were significant downsides of adding so many foreign workers to the population since 1997, with schools, hospitals and roads ‘struggling to cope’.

In a 350-page report, MAC said foreign-born workers now fill 16 per cent of low-skill jobs, compared with 7 per cent in 1997. At the same time, the number of British-born workers in low-skilled jobs has fallen by around one million.

It blamed a target-driven regime that is interested only in the academically gifted, at the expense of the less able.

There are now around 1.3million 16- to 24-year-olds who are not in full-time education or working, of whom around 600,000 have no ‘identifiable barrier’ to employment.

The panel also confirmed the wages of the low-paid Britons who do have jobs have been driven down, and cohesion and national ‘wellbeing’ are suffering.

There is also evidence that, in areas where there has been a large influx of migrants, house prices are falling as British people choose to move out.

The MAC, headed by Sir David Metcalf, carried out an investigation of the impact of low-skilled workers on British life and the reasons so many have arrived.

Between 1997 and 2013 there was a 1.1million expansion in the low-skilled immigrant workforce, filling jobs in shops, factories and processing plants, and taking the total to 2.1million.

One million of them have come in the past ten years, half from central and eastern Europe.

MAC said it did not believe the ‘recent deterioration in the youth labour  market was a direct consequence of increased competition for jobs following the inflow of migrant workers, especially after 2004’.

Sir David Metcalf instead laid much of the blame at the door of the education system, which focused on the brightest students, to the detriment of the less academically gifted.

He said: ‘Schools presently have an incentive to boost the number of A*-C grades in GCSE exams. ‘This may imply insufficient attention is given to those towards the bottom of the ability range. Many apprenticeships do not stretch the individual sufficiently and have too little employer input. 

‘Greater attention needs to be given to raising the awareness of, and adjusting aspirations towards, available opportunities and improving the soft skills of those at the lower end of the ability range.’   

The committee interviewed a string of major employers who suggested that migrant workers meet their requirements, ‘while British workers either do not or would not apply for the job in the first place’.

Sir David said many school leavers lack even the ability to ‘look people in the eye and get out of bed in the morning’.

Last night, immigration minister James Brokenshire told the Mail: ‘This report is a depressing indictment of Labour’s record, not just on immigration but right across the board: an education system that failed to equip too many people for the world of work, a skills policy that failed to help people with basic literacy and numeracy, and a welfare system that failed to help people off the dole.

‘The result was a reliance on low-skilled migrant labour and an immigration system that was out of control.

‘This is why it’s so important for government not just to reduce and control immigration, but to reform schools, reform welfare and get more people into training and apprenticeships.’    

The MAC report said it had found no significant evidence of migrants forcing Britons out of the jobs market or leading to a rise in crime.

But it concluded that the winners of mass immigration were the migrants themselves, who earn higher wages than are available at home. Their impact on GDP per head, productivity and prices – the crucial battleground between the two sides in the immigration debate – was ‘very modest’.

In response, Sir Andrew Green of Migrationwatch said: ‘This is a remarkably comprehensive report. It finds that the impact of low-skilled immigration on both GDP per head and productivity is “tiny”. 

‘It also acknowledges additional pressures on housing, health and education. So one has to ask why some people are so keen to promote mass immigration in the teeth of public opinion.’ 

The MAC also warned that future expansion of the European Union must be handled carefully.Standards in schools are a recurring concern among business leaders, several of whom have publicly aired their views.

Sir Stuart Rose, the former Marks and Spencer boss, said too many school leavers struggled with reading, writing and arithmetic.

The experts found wages of the British low-paid have been driven down and there is little enforcement of the payment of the minimum wage to migrants. 

Overall, just a quarter of councils have absorbed three-quarters of the 2.9million rise in the non-UK born population since 2001, putting pressure on education, health, and the housing market and potential problems around ‘cohesion, integration and wellbeing’. 

The biggest increases have come in Lincolnshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and London.

The report said the composition of many local areas had ‘altered rapidly’ creating ‘congestion’.

This includes pressure on maternity services, transport and schools, particularly from ‘churning’, where the children of migrant workers arrive or leave mid-term.
