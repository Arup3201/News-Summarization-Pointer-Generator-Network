The rise to the throne of Queen Victoria in 1837 marked the decline of the use of cosmetics and the era fast became synonymous with strict moral code, sexual restraint and minimal make-up.

But while cosmetics were considered to be immoral during this period, a book originally published in the Victorian era and republished for a modern audience today reveals that self-improvement was very much still on the agenda.

A Lady, Beauty, What It Is and How to Retain It, which was originally published in 1873, has been re-released by The British Library and sheds light on the tricks of the Victorian beauty trade.

Time capsule: A Lady, Beauty, What It Is and How to Retain It, which was first published in 1873, has been re-released and shares Victorian beauty secrets

The practical guide divulges beauty secrets and tips such as how to make your own hair tonics and face 
masks using products such as lard and beef marrow.

It also explains the value of brushing hair for a lengthy 20 minutes both night and day, and instructs women to use a soft badger-hair brush to clean their 
teeth. 

It adds: 'Paint is used, we believe, by some absurd women, on the lips - we need scarcely say to their ultimate injury and always at the user's peril.' 

At the time, it was actresses and prostitutes who wore bold make-up, whilst upper class women used very little and in very 
natural tones.

Still relevant: Much of the advice is still relevant for the modern day beauty fan and there is also a guide for men, The Gentleman's Art of Dressing, With Economy , written by 'A Lounger at the Clubs' in 1876

Much of the advice still has relevance to the modern reader, such as the comment that 'perfect cleanliness is essential to the preservation of the teeth', whilst other parts serve as a reminder of the age in which the book was written: 'The water used for washing the skin should be rain-water, but if London rain-water, it must be filtered to clear it from smuts.'

There is also a guide for men, The Gentleman's Art of Dressing, With Economy, written by 'A Lounger at the Clubs' in 1876.

The quirky guide, which is priced at £7.95 like its women's counterpart, offers advice on dealing with a wet top hat and emphasises the importance of not wearing the same trousers two days in a row.
