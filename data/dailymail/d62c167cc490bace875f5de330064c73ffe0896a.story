A northern Californian couple is praying for the safety of their family who are believed to have been captured by Islamic State militants in northern Syria.

Sharlet David and her husband, Romel, of Modesto, California, fear that as many as 12 family members were  taken from their homes on Monday morning.

'They came at four in the morning. They attacked them and they took them away. They were asleep,' said Sharlet.

Over 100 Assyrian Christian civilians were rounded up by ISIS as its fighters battled Kurdish and Christian militia for control of villages in the northern province of Hassakeh.

Sharlet fears that her brother, his son, his son's wife, and their two small children were among those ripped from their beds that morning.

'What we heard is that it was a sea of black uniforms marching through all the villages, burning down the churches, desecrating the crosses and wreaking havoc,' Romel told KCRA. 

Sharlet's 59-year-old brother had been a car salesman in Modesto, but had returned to war-torn Syria two years ago in the hopes of returning to America with his  son and his family.

They fear that those kidnapped by ISIS might suffer the same fate as the 21 Egyptian Christians beheaded on a beach in Libya earlier this month.

It is also possible that they could be used in a prisoner swap for captured ISIS militants. 

Some villagers were able to escape and one small group managed to contact a relative of Sharlet's, also in Modesto, and told her about the raid.

They said that her brother and his son were taken into the mountains, while his daughter-in-law and grandchildren remained in the village under armed guard.

The Davids did not want family members to be identified directly for fear of retribution.

'We pray,' Romel said. 'We pray all the time.'

The number of Assyrian Christians abducted by the Islamic State in Syria has risen to 220 - far more than was previously feared, according to activists.

Militants are said to have rounded up more hostages from a chain of villages along the strategic Khabur River in the past three days.

After the first abductions on Monday, it was reported that 150 Assyrian Christians were seized after ISIS took control of two communities from Kurdish forces.

Now the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that ISIS had picked up dozens more hostages from 11 communities near the town of Tal Tamr.
