A 14-year-old is accused of killing his grandmother in southwest Atlanta before going to school on Friday morning, turning up for class covered in blood.

Police say the 76-year-old victim, identified as Mary Price, appeared to have died from multiple stab wounds, but they are awaiting autopsy results for the official cause of death.

Price's body was found around 9am inside her home on Fairburn Road, which authorities were called to amid reports of a woman in distress, according to WSBTV.com.

Scene: The 14-year-old suspect is said to have lived in this house in the 1600 block of Fairburn Road, Atlanta, with his grandmother, Mary Price, who was found dead inside the home Friday morning

The boy is said to shown up for class at Therrell High School in clothes that were splattered with blood

'When we arrived we discovered an elderly female that was deceased from multiple injuries,' police spokesman Sgt. Greg Lyon said.

At the same time, the teen arrived a Therrell High School, with school resource officers noticing blood on his clothes.

The boy made also strange statements to people at the school.

He was arrested about 9.30am and later charged with murder.

The victim is the mother of an Atlanta police officer.

But it’s unclear how the suspect is related to the officer, though police said he is not the officer’s son.
