When Liberal supporters took to social media with the hashtag #ImstickingwithTony this weekend, their aim was to express their support for Prime Minister Tony Abbott ahead of a possible leadership spill.

However the tag was quickly hijacked by others, who used it to highlight the mistakes and broken promises of Mr Abbott and the government.

The top trend in Australia on both Saturday and Sunday, the hashtag has maintained momentum as more and more people voice their opinions. 

The 'I'm sticking with Tony' sentiment was sparked by a Facebook post written by Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, who listed all the reasons he would be standing by the prime minister.

'Therefore, even if he'd given a knighthood to Camilla – I'm sticking with Tony!!' the post ends.

Social media is alight with people tweeting under the hashtag #ImStickingWithTony, giving reasons for why they want Mr Abbott to remain as prime minister 

From his stance on asylum seekers and the number of women in cabinet to the similarities between the current political dynamic and Labor's spill, thousands have been using the tweet to ridicule the prime minister.

'#ImStickingWithTony because he gives my wife no excuse not to do the ironing', Herbert Vere Evatt wrote.

'#ImStickingwithTony until we find the suppository of all wisdom', another user Ali joked.

Mr Abbott's position as Minister For Women was also raised by many social media users, as was his Indigenous Australians and even his speech delivery technique.

But the hashtag was quickly hijacked by those making fun of the Prime Minister

Social media users took the Twitter with jokes, angering Liberal supporters who came up with the tag

Some criticised his speech giving abilities 

Others pointed out some of his opinions they didn't agree with

'#ImStickingWithTony because he's made saying the same thing twice, saying the same thing twice, cool again. He's made it cool again', Noel Hodda wrote. 

Despite the jokes Liberal supporters did jump to the defence of Mr Abbott, commending him on his achievements as leader, the Labor voices seemed louder.

This is just the latest in a series of gaffes which have left the prime minister red-faced and having to defend his position.

Most recent was Mr Abbott's decision to award a knighthood to Prince Phillip, dubbed a 'Knightmare' and widely ridiculed even within his own party.

Branded a 'stuff-up' by even the most conservative media commentators, the prime minister's decision to knight the Duke of Edinburgh was very poorly received.

Mr Abbott's declaration that he would shirtfront President Vladimir Putin at an upcoming G20 meeting was another of his widely criticised moves.

When Mr Abbott, live on ABC radio, winked after hearing the caller on had to work on a phone-sex line to make ends meet is another example of what some called poor judgement.

In a wink of an eye, Abbott became an internet sensation for his response to the phone-sex worker who called ABC talkback radio to complain about rising costs. 

Caught on camera winking to host Jon Faine before addressing the caller's concerns, Abbott earned the title 'creep' on social media. 

In Abbott's defence it was radio, although he appeared to have forgotten an important rule of politics - someone is always watching.

The unfortunate gaffe which saw him declare he was not the 'suppository of all wisdom' was delivered to a room of Liberal faithfuls during the 2013 election campaign.

'No one, however smart, however well-educated, however well experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom,' Mr Abbott declared. 

What he probably meant was repository. The linguistic fumble resulted in honorary website thesuppositroyofallwisdom.com, created purely to spit out Abbott quotes. 

Just one day after the suppository mix-up, Abbott relied on an interesting quality to link Fiona Scott, then Liberal candidate for the western Sydney seat Lindsay, and her predecessor Jackie Kelly. 

He told media they both had 'a bit of sex appeal'. Abbott played it down as exuberance and later dubbed it a daggy dad moment.

Then, in the final days of the 2013 election campaign, Abbott made a last-ditch plea to voters via the cast of reality show Big Brother. 

In a message to housemates, Abbott told them to vote for the 'guy with the not-bad-looking daughters'. It might have helped him get elected, but when you're prime minister relying on the looks of your daughters probably won't cut it. 

 Years before Abbott took the title of prime minister, a somewhat insensitive comment in Afghanistan landed the then opposition leader in hot water. 

While talking to soldiers about the loss of their comrade, Abbott said sometimes s*** happens. 

The gaffe was compounded in a subsequent interview when Abbott was asked to explain the comments. His reaction of 24 awkward seconds of silence made for compelling viewing.
