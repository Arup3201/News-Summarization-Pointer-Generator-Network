German Chancellor Angela Merkel has attempted to escape the heat of the current eurozone crisis, by donning her swimming costume for a spot of relaxation on the Italian island of Ischia.

Mrs Merkel was snapped as she enjoyed a dip while holidaying with her husband at the Hotel Miramare on the island, which is famous for its thermal baths off the coast of Naples.

The chancellor's holiday follows weeks of protest in Cyprus, 
focused on the German leader, over the terms of a euro zone rescue 
package for the island’s banks. It also comes as a senior Russian Cabinet member says his government won't protect Russian depositors who are losing money in Cyprus but may offer assistance to some Russian state companies.

Chancellor Angela Merkel, pictured with her husband Joachim Sauer, visited hotel worker Cristoforco Iacono when she heard he had been laid off

His daughter Marianna said Chanellor Merkel had lunch with the family, adding the visit was a 'pleasure'

But the Chancellor has been urged to consider the impact of the current economic crisis on those in difficulty like failed businesses and young unemployed during her Easter holiday

First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in televised remarks that
it would be a 'great pity' if Russians lose their money in Cyprus, but 
added that the Cabinet won't take any action to soften the blow.

He added, however, that while his government sees no reason for offering
any assistance to Cyprus, it may take unspecified action to help reduce
the damage for Russian state companies.

Big depositors at Cyprus' largest bank, including some Russians, may be 
forced to accept losses of up to 60 percent, far more than initially 
estimated under the European rescue package to save the country from 
bankruptcy.

Stefano Caldoro, president of the local Campania region, urged the Chancellor - nicknamed Merkiavelli for what some have dubbed her Machiavellian political tactics -  to consider the impact of the current economic crisis during her Easter holiday, the Telegraph reports.

Cypriots step in the streets to protest against massive cuts imposed by the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund

'Here there are 10 young unemployed for every young one without work in Germany,' Mr Caldoro said in a video message published by Italian media.

The video was entitled: 'Welcome to our ever hospitable land Mrs Merkel. But now look around you' and was aired with German subtitles.

In a strongly-worded message Mr Caldoro said Italians could not tolerate a 'double-sided Europe' nor anti-German sentiment.

'But Chancellor Merkel should reflect: here is a stronger country that today enjoys the benefits of the crisis from others,' he said. 'And this is a Europe that cannot continue.'
