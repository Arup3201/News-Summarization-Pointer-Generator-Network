Footage of a Victorian policeman joining a dance circle at an Australia Day music festival has gone viral

The video, which has garnered almost 20,000 views, shows the policeman dancing in the middle of a large, enthusiastic circle of music-lovers, at one point dropping to the ground in mimic of the revellers.

The police officer even takes off his hat and puts it on backwards while continuing to dance.

The crowd around him appears to be very receptive to the unexpected addition to the al fresco dance floor, dancing around him and responding to his movements. 

'I saw some people getting crazy in a small circle on the dancefloor while I was filming from our bar-rooftop,' said tech musician Gunner Guess, who performed at the four-day festival, on the video.

'Wondering why they're screamin [sic] out loud till I realized there was a special dancer with a yellow west, epic moment!!!' he said.

'More cops like this please... We are one family after all...' said one Facebook user.

'This kinda sums up rainbow serpent festival,' said another user.

Another Facebook user commented that 'Crime was down 99.9% in his jurisdiction'.

'I talked to him by coincidence hours before just whilst he was on duty and he was having a great day.' 

'Even the police are on cloud 9 and embrace the positive energy throughout the entire festival,' commented one Facebook user. 

While a spokesperson from Victorian police said that the crowd was generally well-behaved, but the festival was not without incident.

The ABC reported that a 35-year-old man was accused of assaulting a woman after following her into the women's tent.

A 38-year-old man and a 23-year-old man are also facing drug charges.
