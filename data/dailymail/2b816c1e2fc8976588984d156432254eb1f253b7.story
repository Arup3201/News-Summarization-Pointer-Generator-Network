A Kansas couple who love the filthy sport called mudbogging tied the knot Sunday in the most appropriate place possible: a giant, sloppy mud pit.

Jared Baylor and Taylor Ratcliff made their love official in a flash mob wedding at this weekend's Toronto Days Mud Run in Toronto, Kansas.

Before shocked friends and all the spectators of the event, which challenges drivers to plow as quickly as possible through a mud pit, Jared and Taylor traded I Do's in the back of a pick-up.

I do the mud! Jared Baylor and Taylor Ratcliff got married in a mud pit on Sunday

According to WIBW, the couple had managed to keep the wedding, which took place just east of Wichita, a secret until the last minute.

The processional began as Jared drove his pickup truck into the center of the competition mud pit. Instead of plowing ahead like a competitor, though, he stopped short.

With a little help, Taylor--with her classic white dress hiked up and a fistful of autumn-colored flowers--managed to climb into the back of the truck.

Beautiful bride: The couple love the sport of mud bogging, which challenges drivers to plow through mud pits as quickly as possible, so they decided to get married in the middle of a competition

Sweet: The wedding a surprise to many. The couple kept it a secret until the very last minute when they were wed at Kansas' Toronto Days Mud Run just east of Wichita

A passage from Corinthians was part of their vows, which lasted only a couple of minutes.

The groomsmen--who, like the groom, wore short-sleeved button shirts and khaki shorts--posed with the cowboy boot-wearing bridesmaids for a picture with the happy couple.

Mr. and Mrs. Baylor then drove off into the sunset.

As they did, Taylor's mud-speckled face and torso emerged from the cab of the truck to scream out her excitement one last time to the overjoyed crowd.
