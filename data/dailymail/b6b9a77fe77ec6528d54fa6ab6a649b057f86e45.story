The mystery buyer who paid a record £89million for Francis Bacon's Three Studies Of Lucian Freud is a member of the Qatari royal family dubbed the most powerful woman in art, it was claimed today.

Speculation has been rife about the identity of the successful bidder after the triptych last week made history by becoming the most expensive work of art ever to be sold at auction.

Today, the latest name to emerge is that of Sheikha Mayassa, the sister of the emir of Qatar who has  around $1billion a year to spend on art in her role as head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA).

Wealthy: Sheika Mayassa has been named this year's most powerful person in art due to Qatari royal family's spending power

Expensive: Francis Bacon's three-paneled painting Three Studies Of Lucian Freud, pictured, became the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction on Tuesday when it soared to $142.4 million at Christie's

Easel does it: Triptych 1976, by Francis Bacon (1909-1992), which was bought by Roman Abramovich in 2008

Auction: The 1969 triptych, never before offered at auction, carried a pre-sale estimate of about $85 million

Page Six says it has been told by 
'numerous sources' that the painting was bought by New York's respected 
Acquavella Gallery on behalf the Mayassa, whose official title is Her 
Excellency Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani.

Last
month, Mayassa was named the most influential figure in the art world 
in a 'power list' published by Britain's ArtReview magazine.

The 30-year-old climbed the list after coming in 11th place last year because of her 'sheer buying power', the magazine said.

The
QMA bought French post-impressionist Paul Cezanne's masterpiece The 
Card Players for $250 million last year, making it the most expensive 
painting sold to date.

'If 
and when Doha finds it has bought enough art, there's going to be a hole
in the market that no one else can fill,' ArtReview said.

A
spokesman for Acquavella declined to comment and calls by Page Six to 
the Embassy of Qatar in Washington, DC, were not returned.

New record: The jaw-dropping price easily broke the $86.3 million Bacon, pictured, record set in 2008, months before financial markets crashed and sent the art market into a brief decline

The 1969 triptych, never before 
offered at auction and which carried a pre-sale estimate of about $85 
million, easily eclipsed the $119.9 million price of Edvard Munch's The
Scream, achieved in May of last year at Sotheby's.

The
painting sold after a protracted bidding war in a packed New York 
salesroom and via telephone.

The
jaw-dropping price easily broke the 2008 Bacon record, months before 
financial markets crashed and sent the art market into a brief decline.

Since then, new, deep-pocketed collectors from around the globe have driven prices to record levels.

At
a recent preview, Christie's head of postwar and contemporary art, 
Brett Gorvy, noted that collectors from Asia, Russia and the Mideast 
flush with cash were determined to assemble world-class collections 
featuring trophy works.

Bacon (1909-1992) was born in Dublin to English parents and moved to London in 1926.

Although
he had no formal training as an artist, he started to exhibit his work 
in the 1930s and a decade later his angst-ridden paintings of twisted and 
mutated forms became a sensation in the artistic community. 

He died of a heart attack in Madrid in 1992.

Today, his work is among the most popular of 20th-century art at auction.

In May, Christie's achieved the highest total in the history of auctions when it sold $495 million worth of art at its postwar and contemporary sale.

The auction house said Bacon's three-paneled work, which depicts the Dublin-born painter's friend and fellow artist Lucian Freud on a chair, with a view from each side and one face on, was 'a true masterpiece that marks Bacon and Freud's relationship' and their 'creative and emotional kinship.'

'The juxtaposition of radiant sunshine yellow contrasting with the brutal physicality and immediacy of the brushstrokes in this celebrated life-size triptych is what makes Bacon's art so remarkable,' said Francis Outred, the head of European postwar and contemporary art for Christie's.

'This suddenly becomes a very important conversation between two masters,' Outred said in an interview.

He noted that Three Studies Of Lucian Freud is one of only two existing full-length triptychs of Freud, a grandson of the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud, and that the three panels were separated for 15 years in the 1970s before being reunited.

Christie's also offering a Warhol Coca-Cola, which carries an estimate of $40 million to $60 million, and a sculpture by Jeff Koons, Balloon Dog (Orange) expected to fetch $35 million to $55 million.

On Wednesday, Sotheby's will try to break the $71.7 million record price for a Warhol when if offers the monumental Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), which has an estimated sale price of $60 million to $80 million.
