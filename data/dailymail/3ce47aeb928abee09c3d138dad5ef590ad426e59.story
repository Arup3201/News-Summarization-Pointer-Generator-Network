'Falklands should be Argentinean': Roger Waters, 68, said he was ashamed of Britain's colonial past

Pink Floyd star Roger Waters has entered the debate over the Falkland Islands, declaring that they ‘should be Argentinian’.

In an interview with Chilean television, the 68-year-old said he was happy to say so as an Englishman because he was ashamed of Britain’s colonial past, ‘when we were out raping and plundering and stealing’.

Asked about the rights of the residents to decide their future, he conceded: ‘The Falkland Islanders are British ... so they have a point of view.’

It comes after actor Sean Penn a fortnight ago accused Britain of ‘ludicrous and archaic colonialism’ over the islands.

In recent weeks Argentina has increased its demands for sovereignty of the Falklands, which have been British territory since 1833.

Waters was speaking during in an interview with Chilean state television TVN, to be screened on Thursday in South America, where the Falklands are known as Las Malvinas.

Journalist Amaro Gomez-Pablos asked him: 'You’ve landed in South America in the middle of a diplomatic tug of war. Are the Falklands-Malvinas British or are they Argentinian?'

Waters, who sang and played bass with Pink Floyd, replied: 'I think they should be Argentinian.'

Contested: Roger Waters said the Falklands should be Argentinean just two weeks after Sean Penn accused Britain of 'ludicrous colonialism'

Asked if he had no qualms about saying that as an Englishman, he said: 'By and large I am as ashamed as I could possibly be of our colonial past.

'I take no pride in the fact that for 150 years or so the sun never set on the British empire, and that we were out raping and plundering and stealing as much as we could from everybody all over the world.

'That kind of imperialism is not something that as an Englishman I am proud of.'

Asked
about the argument that the Falkland Islanders have the right to decide
on their own future, he conceded: 'The Falkland Islanders are British, 
aren’t they, so they have a point of view and there is a case to be 
made.'

Waters also gave a press conference in the capital Santiago de Chile where he said: 'The 1982 (Falklands) war saved Margaret Thatcher’s political career but it cost the lives of many Argentinians and Brits.'

Outspoken: Sean Penn sparked fury by accusing Britain of 'ludicrous and archaic colonialism'

Waters first made his opinions on the Falklands War known in 1983 with the release of Pink Floyd’s album The Final Cut.

The concept album, written entirely 
by Waters, is said to be an attack on Margaret Thatcher’s response to 
Argentina’s 1982 invasion of the Falklands.

It’s first track The Post War Dream includes the lyric 'Oh Maggie, Maggie, what have we done?'

Politicians criticised the decision 
to send Prince William on a routine six-week RAF training exercise there
shortly before the 30th anniversary of the war.

And
on Monday tensions rose further when Argentinian officials stopped two 
British-owned cruise liners from docking as they arrived from the 
Falklands.

More than 
2,500 holidaymakers were prevented from visiting the city of Ushuaia 
after the Star Princess was refused entry to a port following a protest 
from war veterans.

A second ship, P&O owned Adonia, carrying 700 passengers, was also turned away.

David
Cameron has made it clear Britain will never negotiate sovereignty with
Argentina against the wishes of the islands’ population of 3,000.
