Richard Stubbs - a host on 774 ABC Melbourne radio

A leading ABC radio host has reportedly been forced to apologise to a room full of colleagues after claims that he bullied a number of female staff. 

Richard Stubbs - an afternoon presenter on 774 ABC Melbourne - has been the subject of an internal enquiry following a formal complaint lodged by a senior producer, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

It is understood the former stand up comedian has taken leave from the workplace since the apology and is expected to return sometime this month.

An ABC spokesman told Daily Mail Australia Mr Stubbs showed 'deep regret for any distress caused to his colleagues'.

'ABC management was made aware of workplace issues regarding Richard Stubbs and undertook an enquiry with concerned staff,' the spokesman said.

'The ABC is satisfied the matter has been resolved appropriately.

'He is on scheduled leave and will return in 2015 and is looking forward to a positive year with the team at 774.'

The spokesman was unable to confirm exactly when Mr Stubbs will be returning but said he is expected to be back at 'the commencement of the broadcasting year', believed to be mid-January.

The formal complaint was submitted two months ago which prompted the enquiry in November, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

Before his gig on radio, Mr Stubbs was a well-known stand up comedian and performed both nationally and internationally.

He also made regular appearances and also hosted TV show Hey Hey It's Saturday in 1998 and 1999.

Mr Stubbs joined the afternoon 774 ABC program in 2006 which airs weekdays from 1pm to 3pm.
