A carer left a disabled patient sitting in her car for two hours in freezing winter temperatures.

Wilma Goodbrand, 42, repeatedly left Stephen Armstrong - who was paralysed from the neck down and required 'constant supervision' - alone in her car while she attended to another client in Lanarkshire, a court heard.

Goodbrand narrowly escaped a prison sentence today following her conviction for willfully neglecting Mr Armstrong - who died in April this year - during the bitterly cold winter of 2011.

Mr Armstrong, who had learning difficulties, was left paralysed after falling down a flight of stairs while under sedation in 2008.

Goodbrand, a carer with Church of Scotland group Threshold West of Scotland, cruelly left him alone in her car on numerous occasions during November and December 2011 as she visited another client in East Kilbride.

Threshold had been sub-contracted by South Lanarkshire Council to provide care for Mr Armstrong, but sacked Goodbrand when her actions emerged.

Goodbrand, of Wishaw, was found guilty of willfully neglecting Stephen between November and December 2011 at Hamilton Sheriff court last month.

Today Sheriff Douglas Brown, who described Goodbrand's actions as 'an extraordinary way to treat someone', sentenced her to a maximum community payback order sentence of 300 hours unpaid work.

Mr Armstrong's sister, Katherine Alexander, told how she had trusted her brother's carer 'implicitly'.

The mother-of-one, 52, from Argyll, said: 'The important thing for me is that Wilma Goodbrand will never work in care again.

'I am appalled by what Wilma did and I trusted her implicitly. It was a huge shock when she was charged and an even bigger shock when she was convicted.

'Stephen has been hugely let down by the care sector. Care budgets are being squeezed and there are going to be more people in the same situation as Wilma.

She knew what she was doing was wrong but care workers are being overworked. They are asked to go the extra mile and work long hours.'

Ms Alexander said Goodbrand's employer should have been 'standing in the dock beside her'.

'I feel no sympathy for her but I do think employers should be held responsible too,' she said.

Defence lawyer Sandy Morrison said: 'The severity of the offence is not lost on her.

'She has a previous good character and hasn’t had any sort of blemishes or issues with her employers.  She is clearly fit to carry out unpaid work as an alternative to custody.'

Sentencing Goodbrand, Sheriff Douglas Brown said: 'It would have been an ordeal for anyone to be left in a vehicle.

'It was potentially dangerous as he required constant supervision and it was never explained why you did it. This seems an extraordinary way to treat someone but in your favour you have no previous convictions and this seems to be entirely out of character.

'I also accept that you have had significant punishment in that you have lost your job.

'I’ll make a community payback order with the maximum sentence of 300 hours unpaid work to be completed in six months as a direct alternative to custody,' he added.

A spokesman for CrossReach, the Social Care Council of the Church of Scotland, said: 'CrossReach sincerely regrets what occurred in the late winter of 2011 which resulted in a member of staff being dismissed as a result of failing to meet the standards expected our staff.

'Following the incident a Critical Incident Review, informed by a review of our safeguarding procedure, examined the event and an action plan, detailing actions to seek to prevent a re-occurrence, was implemented.  This is a high priority for CrossReach and will be kept under review.'
