The UK could launch a military strike against Syria without the support of the United Nations, government legal advice released today claims.

Downing Street published the official legal position suggesting Britain would not breach international law if it launched ‘military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting’ further use of chemical weapons.

And the government released an intelligence report – likened to the so-called Iraq dodgy dossier – which claimed it is ‘highly likely’ that the Syrian regime was responsible for a chemical attack in Damascus on August 21.

Legal advice: Prime Minister David Cameron leaves Downing Street for the Commons debate on Syria

David Cameron had hoped to secure the backing of the House of Commons for imminent military action in a crunch vote tonight.

But Labour leader Ed Miliband has refused to back the government, setting seven different conditions which would need to be met before the opposition would support an air strike.

MPs have been recalled to Parliament to debate the UK response to the use of chemical weapons against the Syrian people.

Mr Miliband wants the government to pursue any action through the United Nations, but both Russia and China have vowed to veto any UN resolution backing military action.

Ahead of this afternoon’s debate, Number 10 released its legal position insisting Britain could legally go it alone and support the United States in a targeted strike to act as a deterrent for future use of chemical weapons.

Justifiable: The two-page legal position insists
Britain could carry out a targeted military strike against Syria 
without securing a UN resolution

The legal advice states: ‘Previous 
attempts by the UK and its international partners to secure a resolution
of this conflict, end its associated humanitarian suffering and prevent
the use of chemical weapons through meaningful action by the Security 
Council have been blocked over the last two years.'

It argues that if Russia and China continue to block action through the UN Security Council there would be 'no practicable alternative' to the use of force to 'deter and degrade the capacity for the further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime'.

It adds: ‘In these circumstances, and as an exceptional measure on grounds of overwhelming humanitarian necessity, military intervention to strike specific targets with the aim of deterring and disrupting further such attacks would be necessary and proportionate and therefore legally justifiable.

‘Such an intervention would be directed exclusively to averting a humanitarian catastrophe, and the minimum judged necessary for that purpose.’

As the main party leaders briefed 
their MPs on their return to Westminster for the emergency recall of 
Parliament, six RAF Typhoon jets were deployed to Cyprus to protect UK 
interests and sovereign bases.

The
Prime Minister yesterday battled desperately to get a consensus for a 
missile attack, but was forced by Mr Miliband and Tory rebels to allow 
UN inspectors time to report on last week’s chemical weapons atrocity.

But a three page dossier from the Joint Intelligence Committee made clear that the Assad regime was responsible for the chemical weapons attack last week in which 350 died.

The JIC found there are 'no plausible alternative scenarios to Assad's regime being behind the attack and has given the Prime Minister full access to 'highly sensitive' intelligence.

It could not, however, come up with a 'precise motivation' for the attack.

It concludes: ‘It is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a chemical weapons attack on this scale.

‘The regime has used chemical weapons on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past.

‘There is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack. These factors make it highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible.’

Cabinet ministers were briefed on the latest intelligence this morning, ahead of the Commons debate.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The judgment of the Joint Intelligence Committee is that a chemical weapons attack did occur in Damascus last week; that it is highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible; that there is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability; and that no opposition group has the capability to conduct a chemical weapons attack on this scale.

‘Ministers agreed that it is fundamentally in our national interest to uphold the longstanding convention on chemical weapons and to make clear that they cannot be used with impunity.

‘Any response should be legal, proportionate and specifically in response to this attack and everyone around the Cabinet table agreed that it is not about taking sides in the Syrian conflict nor about trying to determine the outcome.’ 

Here is the full text of the Joint Intelligence Committee assessment of the Syrian chemical weapons attack, followed by a letter from Jon Day, chairman of the JIC, to the Prime Minister:JIC assessment of 27 August on Reported Chemical Weapons use in Damascus

A chemical attack occurred in Damascus on the morning of 21 August, resulting in at least 350 fatalities. It is not possible for the opposition to have carried out a CW [chemical weapons] attack on this scale.

The regime has used CW on a smaller scale on at least 14 occasions in the past. There is some intelligence to suggest regime culpability in this attack. These factors make it highly likely that the Syrian regime was responsible.

Extensive video footage attributed to the attack in eastern Damascus (which we assess would be very difficult to falsify) is consistent with the use of a nerve agent, such as sarin, and is not consistent with the use of blister or riot control agents.

There is no obvious political or military trigger for regime use of CW on an apparently larger scale now, particularly given the current presence in Syria of the UN investigation team. Permission to authorise CW has probably been delegated by President Asad to senior regime commanders, such as [*], but any deliberate change in the scale and nature of use would require his authorisation.

There is no credible evidence that any opposition group has used CW. A number continue to seek a CW capability, but none currently has the capability to conduct a CW attack on this scale.

Russia claims to have a 'good degree of confidence' that the attack was an 'opposition provocation' but has announced that they support an investigation into the incident. We expect them to maintain this line.

The Syrian regime has now announced that it will allow access to the sites by UN inspectors.

There is no immediate time limit over which environmental or physiological samples would have degraded beyond usefulness. However, the longer it takes inspectors to gain access to the affected sites, the more difficult it will be to establish the chain of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.

From Jon Day, chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee to the Prime Minister:

SYRIA: REPORTED CHEMICAL WEAPONS USE

Following the widespread open source reports of chemical weapons (CW) use in the suburbs of Damascus in the early hours of 21 August 2013, the JIC met on 25 August to agree an assessment.

At a subsequent meeting on 27 August we met again to review our level of confidence in the assessment relating to the regime's responsibility for the attack.

The JIC's conclusions were agreed by all Committee members. The final paper informed the National Security Council meeting on 28 August, at which I provided further background and a summary of the most recent reporting, analysis and challenge.

The paper's key judgements, based on the information and intelligence available to us as of 25 August, are attached.

It is important to put these JIC judgements in context. We have assessed previously that the Syrian regime used lethal CW on 14 occasions from 2012.

This judgement was made with the highest possible level of certainty following an exhaustive review by the Joint Intelligence Organisation of intelligence reports plus diplomatic and open sources.

We think that there have been other attacks although we do not have the same degree of confidence in the evidence. A clear pattern of regime use has therefore been established.

Unlike previous attacks, the degree of open source reporting of CW use on 21 August has been considerable. As a result, there is little serious dispute that chemical attacks causing mass casualties on a larger scale than hitherto (including, we judge, at least 350 fatalities) took place.

It is being claimed, including by the regime, that the attacks were either faked or undertaken by the Syrian Armed Opposition. We have tested this assertion using a wide range of intelligence and open sources, and invited HMG and outside experts to help us establish whether such a thing is possible.

There is no credible intelligence or other evidence to substantiate the claims or the possession of CW by the opposition. The JIC has therefore concluded that there are no plausible alternative scenarios to regime responsibility.

We also have a limited but growing body of intelligence which supports the judgement that the regime was responsible for the attacks and that they were conducted to help clear the Opposition from strategic parts of Damascus.

Some of this intelligence is highly sensitive but you have had access to it all.

Against that background, the JIC concluded that it is highly likely that the regime was responsible for the CW attacks on 21 August.

The JIC had high confidence in all of its assessments except in relation to the regime's precise motivation for carrying out an attack of this scale at this time - though intelligence may increase our confidence in the future.

There has been the closest possible cooperation with the Agencies in producing the JIC's assessment. We have also worked in concert with the US intelligence community and agree with the conclusions they have reached.
