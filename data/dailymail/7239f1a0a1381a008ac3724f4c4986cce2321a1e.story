A woman's eternal quest for youth and beauty can take her as far as... her kitchen cupboard.

Expensive new creams, lotions, scrubs and serums land on chemist shelves every day, each promising to reverse the hands of time and make our faces and hair smoother and more beautiful.

But British women prefer something much more basic when it comes to maintaining glowing cheeks and lustrous locks, according to research.

Rubbing coffee granules on thighs to combat cellulite and applying baking soda to teeth to make them whiter are revealed to be among women's weirdest beauty secrets.

Putting cold damp tea bags on tired eyes made the list, as did using honey as a face mask

Other tricks include rinsing hair with raw eggs or beer to make it shine, and dabbing toothpaste on spots and insect bites to help them heal.

The research - which delved into popular beauty regimes, habits and rituals - found that one in ten women would be prepared to try any tip, however bizarre, if it made them look better.

And 10 per cent said they were a sucker for the latest beauty fad.

Sleeping in socks full of moisturiser and brushing talcum powder through hair are also common.

The extreme lengths women go to were revealed following a study of 2,000 by skincare experts Simple.

Women in the survey also said they would be prepared to shell out £79 on average for the latest all-singing, all-dancing wonder product.

Some women put lipstick on their cheeks when they run out of blusher

A spokesman for Simple said: 'This bizarre list of beauty tips and tricks just shows the lengths some women will go to look beautiful and how confusing some of these tips are.

'Women have a different approach to products and beauty tips, some like to adopt the latest innovations and others prefer to stick to what they know.

'We wanted to poll women to find out what alternative beauty treatments they use and what their approach is to the latest 'must-have' products.'

More conventional remedies to stay 
looking youthful include drinking plenty of water, milk and cranberry 
juice, the survey found.

Other unconventional remedies include rubbing strawberries on the face to minimize the appearance of freckles and adding sugar to soap to exfoliate.

Wrinkle busting tips were listed as sleeping on your back to avoid lines on your face and investing in a silk pillow case.

The poll also delved into women's opinions of harsh cosmetic procedures, and one in five said those who go under the knife to stay youthful are 'vain and self-absorbed'. Nearly a third said they have 'more money than sense'.

When asked what the key to looking young was, three quarters of women said it was maintaining a healthy diet.

Two thirds hailed drinking lots of water as the key to keeping youthful, but 57 per cent said it was down to the genes you were born with.

Baking soda on teeth to make them whiter came number 13 in women's top beauty tips

A third attributed it to a good daily beauty routine and religiously removing make-up.

A dedicated 14 per cent eat particular foods in order to look young, with broccoli being the most popular, followed by oily fish.

Two thirds said they find conflicting claims from beauty products confusing, but ten per cent said 'anything was worth a shot'.

A spokesman for Simple added: 'This survey shows many women are prepared to go to extreme lengths to find the right beauty regime.

'Many women are prepared to go to extreme lengths to fight the aging process and that is their choice.

'But our advice would be to follow a healthy lifestyle instead of being pressured to try the latest fads or any invasive surgery.

'Adopt a healthy routine and your skin will thank you for it - you only have one skin, so look after it.

'At Simple we believe that taking care of your appearance should be straight-forward and uncomplicated.'
