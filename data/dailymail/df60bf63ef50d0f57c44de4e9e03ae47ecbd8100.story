The owner of a coach company was stunned after council bosses fined one of his staff for driving in a bus lane - even though he was in a bus.

John Henderson, owner of Henderson Travel, was baffled after the driver was slapped with a £60 penalty charge by Glasgow City Council.

The fine, which is reduced to £30 if it is paid within 14 days, was issued after a vehicle from his bus fleet drove on a city centre road designated for buses, taxis and cyclists only.

The number 329 bus was 'caught' on the morning of February 5 as it drove along Cathedral Street, when a council CCTV cameras snapped the registration plate.

John, 57, from Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, said he and his wife Linda were 'speechless' at the fine.

He said: 'It is sheer stupidity that a bus can be fined for driving in a bus lane. This was a proper bus.

'It's a small to medium sized bus with 27 seats - but it's still a bus. It's an over-zealous attack by the council.'

Cathedral Street has been revealed as the second most prolific money-generating street in Glasgow after a council crackdown on the illegal use of bus lanes.

More than £500,000 in fines has been made after almost 20,000 motorists were caught driving in the bus lane between April 23 - when the council launched its CCTV crackdown on bus lanes - and December 31 last year.

The city's biggest cash generator is Glassford Street's bus lane, which has netted around 28,000 drivers, allowing the council to rake in nearly £700,000 from fines.

John, who has owned the company for 30 years, accused council bosses of using the lanes as a way of raking in cash.

He said: 'This has reinforced to me that bus lanes are one big money-making exercise.

'This has nothing to do with trying to keep traffic running smoothly, which is what bus lanes are meant for.'

A Glasgow City Council spokesman said the fine was sent out in error. He said: 'Another vehicle was in the lane behind the bus lane and it was included in the picture taken by the bus lane camera.

'A notice was sent out by mistake and it has now been cancelled.'
