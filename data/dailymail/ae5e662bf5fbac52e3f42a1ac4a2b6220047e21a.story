George W. Bush has praised the 40 passengers and crew who fought back against their Flight 93 hijackers on 9/11 for carrying out what he described as one of the most courageous acts in U.S. history.

The former president was at a ceremony on Saturday dedicating a memorial at the nation's newest national park in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, as the U.S. marks the 10th anniversary of the terror attacks.

Americans will also come together on Sunday where the World Trade Center soared in Manhattan, New York, and in Washington D.C. where the Pentagon now stands as a fortress once breached.

The nation's focus will turn on Sunday
 to ceremonies at the Pentagon and in lower Manhattan for the dedication
 of the national September 11 memorial.

President
 Barack Obama planned to attend ceremonies at both sites, as well as the
 Pennsylvania memorial, and was scheduled to speak at a Sunday evening 
service at the Kennedy Center.

The
 New York ceremony begins at 8:30am local time, with a moment of silence 16 minutes
 later - coinciding with the exact time when the first tower of the World Trade Centre was struck by a hijacked jet.

And
 then, one by one, there will be the reading of names of the 2,977 
killed on September 11 - in New York, at the Pentagon and in rural 
Pennsylvania.

Where the twin towers of the World 
Trade Centre once stood now lies two granite pools in its footprints 
with waterfalls cascading 30 feet below.

On Saturday night the 'Tribute in 
Lights' could be seen shining into the sky as a mark of remembrance of 
the World Trade Centre twin towers in New York.

It is believed the Flight 93 hijackers
 wanted to crash the plane into the Capitol in Washington D.C. where the
 House and Senate were both in session - but the aircraft never made it 
there.

Mr Bush said the cockpit storming 
‘ranks among the most courageous acts in American history’ and former 
president Bill Clinton said the passengers and crew were ‘ordinary 
people given no time at all to decide’ what to do.

Mr
 Clinton likened the actions of those aboard Flight 93 to the defenders 
of the Alamo in Texas or the Spartans at the Battle of Thermopylae some 
2,500 years ago, who knew they were going to die.

'They
 gave the entire country an incalculable gift,’ Mr Clinton added. ‘They 
saved the capital from attack’ and avoided Al Qaeda’s a symbolic victory
 of ‘smashing the centre of American government.’

The remarks by Mr Bush and Mr Clinton 
drew standing ovations and loud cheers from the ceremony which drew 
about 5,000 people, including 4,000 invited guests including the crash 
victims' families.

Vice 
President Joe Biden was on hand to unveil the Wall of Names at the 
memorial - a set of 40 marble slabs, each inscribed with the name of a 
passenger or crew member who died.

Thoughtful: President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama visit section 60 at Arlington National Cemetery on September 10, which contains service members killed in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars

Service: Flags are carried into St. Patrick's Cathedral during a memorial ceremony on Saturday to honor New York firefighters that were killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center

Former first lady Laura Bush and Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Biden, were both seen to wipe tears away at the ceremony.

‘The
 moment America's democracy was under attack our citizens defied their 
captors by holding a vote,’ Mr Bush said, referring to when those on the
 plane decided to try to overpower the hijackers.

‘The choice they made would cost them 
their lives,’ he added. Mr Bush was joined at the ceremony by the 
Reverend Daniel Coughlin, who was the U.S. House chaplain at the time of
 the attacks.

Gordon Felt, president of the Families
 of Flight 93, whose brother Edward participated in the revolt by 
passengers and crew, described the memorial a ‘huge accomplishment’.

‘It's
 one that brings so much comfort to the families knowing, finally, that 
the sacred ground, the site where the flight came down and our loved 
ones rest in perpetuity, is finally protected,' he said.

Meanwhile,
 Americans will gather on Sunday to pray in cathedrals, lay roses before
 fire stations and remember the anniversary of the most devastating 
terrorist attacks since the nation's founding.

The weekend has been dedicated to 
remembrance, with hundreds of ceremonies across the country and around 
the globe, such as a memorial mass at St Patrick's Cathedral in New 
York.

In Brown City, 
Michigan, which has a population of about 1,300 and no direct link to 
the attacks, firemen plan to lay 343 roses on a 15,000-pound steel beam 
salvaged from the World Trade Center.

Since
 venturing to New York in June to claim the beam and bring it home, the 
Michigan firefighters have finished building a brick plaza, lighted 
around the clock and crowned by three flagpoles.

Elsewhere, people joined hands on Saturday morning in lower Manhattan at Battery Park City.

President Obama has already been 
paying tribute to America's resilience and the sacrifice of its war, 
after he made a pilgrimage to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia on
 Saturday.

He was seen strolling with his wife, 
Michelle, among graves filled with dead from the Afghanistan and Iraq 
wars – and said the U.S. cannot be broken by terrorism ‘no matter what 
comes our way’.

Mr Obama held hands with his wife and hugged other visitors among rows of white tombstones from the long wars that he is winding down after more than 6,000 American troop deaths.

‘The terrorists who attacked us that September morning are no match for the character of our people, the resilience of our nation, or the endurance of our values,’ he said in a weekly address.

Mr Obama was a little-known state senator in Illinois at the time of the attacks, but now has the responsibility to help lead the nation in remembrance of a trauma 10 years on.

Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who gave the weekly Republican address, said the terrorists achieved their goal of killing Americans, but failed to destroy the U.S. spirit.

‘The country was not broken, but rather, it was more united in the days after September 11 than at any time in my lifetime,’ Mr Giuliani said.
