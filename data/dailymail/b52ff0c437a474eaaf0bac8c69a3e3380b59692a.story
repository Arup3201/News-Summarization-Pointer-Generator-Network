France are coming to Twickenham to take on England in the Six Nations finale this weekend, but Olivier Giroud showed there is already one Frenchman in London with rugby ability.

The Arsenal striker was eager to show off his keep-ups skills, which were impressive, despite using a rugby ball.

The Gunners frontman managed 29 kick-ups before losing control of the ball and shrieking in frustration.

Giroud, who missed a large part of the season with injury, has been in superb form recently, scoring seven times in his last eight games.

He was on target against Monaco on Tuesday night as Arsenal attempted to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Champions League last 16, but fell just short.

On Thursday the 28-year-old was named in France's squad to play Brazil and Denmark next week.

But despite his goal, France striker Giroud was not able to inspire his team to an aggregate victory
