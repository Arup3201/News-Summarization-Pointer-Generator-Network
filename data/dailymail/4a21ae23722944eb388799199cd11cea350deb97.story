Police are reviewing surveillance footage and urging anyone with information to call a special hotline. Police Chief Darryl Forté also used Twitter to urge the shooter or shooters to surrender. The message said that Forté didn't believe the girl was the intended victim.

'Her name, Angel, it really fit her — she was just so sweet,' the girl's distraught mother, Charity Guinn, told KCTV5. 'She loved to sing and dance.'

The mother added: 'I just feel like none of this is real. She took the bullet for someone else and now she's not here.'

'She was my angel,' she told the Kansas City Star.

Angel was a smart little girl who 'loved to laugh, make good grades and play' with her younger brother, 1-year-old Michael, the Star reported. 

'She loved to read books, she loved math, she loved everything,' the mother, Charity, told KCTV5.

Her favorite books were the Berenstain Bears series.

'They get a kick out of just going around killing people for no reason,' Angel's grandmother, Marie Guinn, told KCTV5.

And mother has a plea for anyone with information about the senseless tragedy: 'Please don't keep quiet.

'I lost my child to a senseless crime,' she told KCTV5. 'It's not fair, it's really not fair.'
