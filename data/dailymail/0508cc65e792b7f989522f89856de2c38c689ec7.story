Already charged: Alleged 'Hollywood Ripper' Michael Gargiulo, 35, has been charged with killing three women

The accused 'Hollywood Ripper' suspected of killing actor Ashton Kutcher’s ex-girlfriend could be responsible for up to 10 murders, a detective claims.

Michael Gargiulo, 35, is already facing trial over the violent stabbing deaths of two female victims and was charged last week with murdering a third.

But a Los Angeles homicide detective claims Gargiulo may have allegedly killed up to 10 women he came into contact with as an air-conditioning repairman.

Gargiulo was charged with murder in 2008 of Los Angeles women Ashley Ellerin, 22, in 2001, who was dating Mr Kutcher, and mother-of-four Maria Bruno, 32, in 2005.

Then last week Gargiulo was also charged with murdering Tricia Pacaccio, 18, in 1993, in Chicago, Illinois - his third alleged victim.

But now Los Angeles County sheriff’s homicide detective Mark Lillienfeld has revealed a statement allegedly made by Gargiulo in jail.

Gargiulo told authorities in Los 
Angeles County Jail that his job took him to thousands of homes over the years, 
reported the Chicago Sun-Times.

But he allegedly added that just 
because 10 women in those homes were killed and his DNA was found does 
not mean he murdered anyone.

Police have only linked him to the 
murders of Ellerin, Bruno and Pacaccio so far, but Mr Lillienfeld 
believes there are other victims.

Statement: Ashton Kutcher, shown in January with wife Demi Moore, testified about the 2001 death of his ex-girlfriend

The statement was made public during a Los Angeles court hearing, Mr Lillienfeld claimed to the Chicago Sun-Times.

However Cook Country officials say 
they have listened to recordings of Gargiulo and looked back at court 
transcripts and found no incriminating statements.

A spokesman for Cook County State Attorney Anita Alvarez slammed Mr Lillienfeld’s comments as ‘inflammatory and misleading’.

‘In our assessment, there were no 
admissions made that could be used to connect and prove his involvement 
in other murders,’ the spokesman told the Chicago Sun-Times.

‘Clearly, if admissions were made 
that could be proven in a court of law, Gargiulo would likely be facing 
additional charges by prosecutors in Los Angeles.’

Gargiulo was arrested in 2008 after allegedly stabbing a Santa Monica woman who fought with an intruder who broke into her home.

DNA found at the scene matched that 
of Garguilo, and investigators then linked him to the murders of Ellerin
and Bruno - before Pacaccio last week.

Mr Kutcher, now married to Demi 
Moore, told police Ellerin never came to the door when he went to her 
home to pick her up for a Grammy Awards party. Her bloodstained body was found later inside the house.

Gargiulo has denied killing the three woman he has been charged with murdering.
