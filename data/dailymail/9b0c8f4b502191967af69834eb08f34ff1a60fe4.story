Riding across a river bareback is tricky enough ... let alone trying to do it on a bear's back.

But that didn't stop this plucky young cub from giving it a go, when he leapt aboard his mother as she tried to catch a salmon.

The youngster clung on for dear life as she galloped across the shallows after the slippery fish in scenes that better resembled a game of Buckaroo than a predator's hunt for her supper.

And as she was concentrating on her meal the young bear became a distraction.

So she sprung into life with him on her back before he was tossed into the water much to his delight. 

The snapper, from West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA, said: 'The mum just wanted to fish so she removed the cub from her back to try and catch food.

Mother's love: While the mother was clearly annoyed by her cub's playful antics, she allowed him to play despite giving him a ticking off

Golden opportunity: As the mother bear was concentrating on her meal the youngster became a distraction

Playful: So she sprung into life with him on her back before he was tossed into the water much to his delight

Stubborn: Each time he fell, he made sure she stopped just long enough for him to clamber back on

'The young grizzly would keep trying until its mother allowed it to climb on her back - only to be playfully thrown off time after time.

'What fascinates me most about bears is the difference between the reputation they have and their actual behaviour.

'They are strong and powerful, yet very gentle, beautiful and curious creatures.'
