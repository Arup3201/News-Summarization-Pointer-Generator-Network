A paedophile who sexually abused a 14-year-old girl months before she killed herself has been jailed.

Kevin Palmer was caught by a police officer engaging in sexual activity with Danielle Formosa in a tent.

Palmer, who was 39 at the time, first met the teenager four months earlier and told her he was a 19-year-old law student.

Danielle, who was in care at the time, arranged by text message to meet Palmer on June 29, 2013.

Robert Woodcock, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court how Danielle was a 'troubled young girl' who was extremely distressed and had been taken into foster care.

Mr Woodcock said: 'They met in Sunderland and bought some cigarettes and a can of pop.

'She noticed he had a rucksack with him and that contained a tent. They went to the park, he put up the tent and they listened to music off his phone.

'When they were in the tent, an officer checked up on them and they both gave false names.

'As he walked away, he heard Danielle refer to the male inside as "Kev", a different name to the one given to the officer.'

Another officer later arrived and told them to come out of the tent before asking for their name and age.

When Danielle gave her name and age to police, Palmer quickly packed up his tent and ran from the scene.

He was later arrested at his home address and interviewed in a the presence of a solicitor.

In December 2013, Danielle was found dead at East Farmhouse home in County Durham, aged 14.

Police said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.

Danielle, who went to St Anthony’s Catholic Girl’s Academy in Sunderland, was a Facebook friend of 14-year-old Sarah Clerkson who was found hanging at a house party in Spennymoor, County Durham, two weeks earlier.

Palmer, now 40, was originally accused of raping the schoolgirl and appeared at Newcastle Crown Court for trial.

Prosecutors made a special application for Danielle's video statement to be played to jurors.

Palmer's defence team objected on the basis he could not have a fair trial if the footage was allowed

to be used as evidence.

After hearing legal argument from both sides, Judge Penny Moreland ruled Danielle's video statement should be heard in court.

But before a jury was sworn to hear the case, Palmer pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity in the presence of Danielle and causing or inciting her to engage in sexual activity.

Nick Peacock, mitigating, said: 'This young lady obviously had troubles.

'Someone
 who goes to prison for an offence like this is treated differently by 
other prisoners then a normal prisoner. It is causing him a great deal 
of concern.

'When I spoke to him, he does show genuine remorse. He is upset about these offences and the death of Danielle.

'He has had a difficult life. He has himself witnessed domestic violence from his mother and father.

'He has been in and out of care. It had a devastating effect on him and it is something he has never really got over.'

Judge Penny Moreland told Palmer: 'In my view, what you did was groom her for sexual activity by persisting in seeing her.

taking a tent.

'She has since these offences taken her own life. You can’t be taken into account for that.

'I have no doubt what you did caused distress and upset. I am not satisfied you show remorse for what you did, I find no evidence of this.

'I accept you have had your own difficulties and your own life has not been straight forward, but that is no excuse for these offences.'

Judge Moreland sentenced Palmer, from Sunderland, to four-and-a-half years in prison.

He will also appear on the sex offences register for life and will be banned indefinitely from having contact with children under 16 without the presence of social services.
