Maverick Tory Nadine Dorries has backed Boris Johnson to be Prime Minister and accused David Cameron of a 'controlling' leadership.

She branded critics within her party of her decision to be the first serving MP to appear on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of here! as 'infantile and stupid.'

Ms Dorries was suspended by the Conservatives for taking a month away from Wesminster so she could take part in the reality show in the Australian jungle, but claimed the then Chief Whip 
Andrew Mitchell approved her absence.

The MP for Mid-Bedfordshire, who has described Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne as 'posh boys', hailed London Mayor Johnson as her 'king of the jungle'.

Nadine's 'hero': London Mayor Boris Johnson

In a interview published in the Sun today, she said: 'I long for the day Boris Johnson is Prime Minister. He is a good man and a hero of mine, and he can reach people other politicians can’t.

'I do believe this will happen, and 
that he will be Prime Minister. If he doesn’t it might be the day I 
consider giving up being an MP.'

She attacked a 'real control mechanism' of MPs under Mr Cameron claiming MPs and how they vote are 'tampered with.'

Mr Johnson, she said, would allow parliament to have a genuine free vote on issues like the abortion time limit.

She added: 'He wouldn’t tamper with 
people’s views, unlike what happens now in Cameron’s Westminster, and he
would be more statesmanlike.'

Ms
Dorries said that she had told Mr Mitchell she would be away for a 
month and that it would be 'controversial' - insisting she had missed 
just three parliamentary sessions and no legislation.

Mr
Mitchell quit as chief whip after a row over his confrontation with 
police at the gates of Downing Street in which he allegedly called the 
officers 'plebs.'

Ms 
Dorries told Sun writer Laura  Armstrong that new Chief Whip Sir George 
Young had asked for a meeting when she returns to Britain, but that she 
could not be de-selected.

She said she would 'justify' her activities to her constituents when she returned home.

The MP claimed that a 'degree of panic' had set in at Downing Street when it learned she would appear on the programme.

She said they feared she was going to 'damage' Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, adding: 'They thought, "What can we do to distance her and rubbish her quickly before she rubbishes us?" It was completely infantile and stupid.'

Ms Dorries is now holed up in a luxury hotel on Queensland's Gold Coast after being the first celebrity to be voted off the show by the public vote.

She was greeted by her partner, vet Chris Hammond, after surviving 12 days on the show and tackling some of its infamous Bushtucker Trials, which included eating an ostrich anus to win meals for her campmates

After leaving the jungle, she claimed to have gone straight back to her day job as a politician, but her bewildered constituency association said the MP, has still not been in contact.

Miss Dorries insisted she had started 
work within hours of being evicted from the Australian jungle, as seen 
by viewers of the ITV show on Wednesday night.

She said she was working from the Palazzo Versace resort, where a superior room costs £285 a night, and where she is due to stay until the series ends early next month.

The MP, who has been paid up to £40,000 to appear on the show, said: ‘There’s been an office set up in my hotel room and I’ve already been back at work actually.

'As soon as I got out of the jungle I was straight back to work.’

But Budge Wells, deputy chairman of the Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association, last night said he has still to hear from his MP, adding: ‘She has not been in contact with me or anyone else in the association.

‘As I understand it she has set up an 
office in her hotel and says she has gone straight back to work but we 
have not heard from her.’

There have been more than 100 complaints from constituents about her absence.

A poll in her constituency revealed almost 60 per cent of Conservatives ‘disapprove’ of her decision to abandon Parliament.

Asked to rate how they feel about Miss Dorries, ranked from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘extremely negative’, she scored just 2.82, while 58 per cent said David Cameron was right to suspend her.Just 8 per cent said they are now more likely to vote for her.

Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, who commissioned the survey, said: ‘Nadine said she was doing the show for the chance to talk to a huge audience about important questions, at a time when nobody pays attention to politicians.

'Unfortunately, her constituents are not buying this.

‘There is a long way to go to the next election and voters can be forgiving. But however well-intentioned, Nadine’s publicity stunt does not look like the triumph she hoped for.’

Labour MP Steve McCabe mocked Miss Dorries’s claim to be working, saying: ‘I’m sure her constituents will be greatly relieved to hear that she is going to do part of her job from her five-star hotel.’
