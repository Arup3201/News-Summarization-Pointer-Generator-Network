The CEO of a healthcare company has sparked a furious Twitter response after suggesting that women who wear high heels are not intelligent.

Jorge Cortell, of Katnerson Systems, posted a photo of a woman's stiletto pumps while at Reverse Demo Day, a conference for entrepreneurs in New York City.

His incendiary accompanying message read: 'Event supposed to be for entrepreneurs, VCs, but these heels (I've seen several like this)... WTF? #brainsnotrequired.'

Sexist: Jorge Cortell tweeted a photo of a women's stiletto pumps while at a conference for entrepreneurs in New York City. His accompanying message read: 'Event supposed to be for entrepreneurs, VCs, but these heels (I've seen several like this)... WTF? #brainsnotrequired'

Unsurprisingly, Twitter users, both male and female, were quick to share their shock at the sexist statement, which generated over 200 replies.

Dave Ambrose was among the first, writing: 'Seriously can't believe you shared this thought. Sexist, much?'

Others echoed his disbelief, with Amilia Karunaratne saying: 'Wow!!!! I can't believe @jorgecortell just made that #dumb comment 
w/pic tag #sexist totally & #ignorant Let women wear heels [sic]'

Debate: Mr Cortell attempted to defend his tweet by claiming he was concerned for the woman's health

And Caryn Vainio added: 'I'm unclear on the connection between a pair of shoes and the abilities or intellect of the woman wearing them.'

Mr Cortell attempted to defend his tweet by claiming he was concerned for the woman's health. He explained that he was 'not sexist. Logical. Perhaps a man was wearing those. Would be equally absurd. High heels are STUPID, bad for your health.'

The argument failed to wash with the growing number of users weighing in on the conversation.
