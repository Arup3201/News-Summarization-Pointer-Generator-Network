Glee beauty Naya Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey just six weeks after they revealed they were tying the knot, her new father-in-law revealed today.

Her marriage to Dorsey may have come as a shock to fans - but it came equally as a surprise to their parents.

Calling the intimate wedding, held at the Las Ventanas al Paraiso resort in Cabo San Lucas, 'beautiful', Ryan's father, Arnold Dorsey, 59, told MailOnline: 'We knew about the wedding six weeks ago, still, it was a bit of a shock!

'I met Naya a couple of weeks ago, I was working in California and I drove up to her house. She's very tiny, real petite, but real down to earth, not with her nose stuck up in the air.'

A beautiful spot: Naya Rivera and Ryan Dorsey tied the knot watched by just 12 guests at Las Ventanas al Paraiso in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on July 19

The couple wed on Ryan's 31st birthday on July 19, with just 12 guests and a minister in attendance.

Among the group were Naya's mother Yolanda and her stepfather - however the brunette's father, George Rivera, didn't attend.

Mr Dorsey, from Charleston, West Virginia, was at the wedding with his wife, Rhonda, while his ex-wife Cheryl, Ryan's mother, was there with her husband David.

He told how wedding guests, including Ryan's brother Aaron, dined on steak, shrimp, seabass and lobster as well as a selection of flatbreads - and that Naya had wanted to marry in Mexico as a birthday present to Ryan.

Despite the fact Naya only split with her ex-fiance Big Sean in April, Mr Dorsey told how she had actually met Ryan four years ago and revealed how she spotted him at a nightclub.

'I knew she met him at some kind of a party, she saw him across a dance club and she went to talk to him.

'He was a playboy, he didn't want to settle down, he wanted to concentrate on his work. But they remained friends and I guess they hooked up after the engagement from Big Sean was dropped', he said.

Mr Dorsey said he had not yet asked Naya about why her engagement ended, but added: 'In time if she wants to say anything about it, she can.'

For now, he says the newlyweds are like 'two lovebirds', and although it was 'strictly family' at their nuptials, friends came to help them celebrate the day afterwards.

According to Us Weekly, the bride tied the knot with Ryan on the same date she had planned to get married to ex Big Sean.

'Naya 
didnâ€™t tell most of her friends that she was marrying Ryan Dorsey, let 
alone that she was dating him!' the insider claimed. 'The whole thing is
 a complete surprise.'

Meanwhile another insider told Us Weekly that Naya used the same wedding hairstylist as Kim Kardashian, Clyde Haygood.

In addition the source also claimed Naya's Monique Lhuillier dress looked 'a lot like the one Kim married Kanye in'.

Naya and Dorsey's romance only became public last week after they were photographed holidaying together in Mexico.

The couple confirmed they had married in Cabo San Lucas on July 19, exclusively to People magazine.

In a joint 
statement, the couple said: 'We feel truly blessed to be joined as 
husband and wife. Our special day was fated and everything we could have
 ever asked for.

'True love always prevails.'

Naya, 27, walked down the aisle in a Monique Lhuillier gown while her groom looked dapper in a Dolce & Gabbana suit.

Ryan, who is from West Virginia, has starred in a series of TV shows and films, including Unspoken, Southland, Parks and Recreation and Mob City.

He recently wrapped filming on Blood Father alongside Mel Gibson and William H Macy.

Although the couple had only just started dating recently, they had been friends for four years.

Their friendship turned to love after Naya's six month engagement to rapper Big Sean ended in April.

Big Sean, real name Sean Anderson, said at the time it was his decision to end the engagement, but denied claims he had cheated on her.

His rep said: 'After careful thought and much consideration, Sean has made the difficult decision to call the wedding off.

'The recent rumours and accusations reported by so called or fake sources are simply untrue.

'Sean wishes Naya nothing but the best and it is still his hope that they can continue to work through their issues privately. We will not be commenting again on this matter.'

Prior to Big Sean, Naya also dated Glee writer Matthew Hodgson and her co-star Mark Salling.
