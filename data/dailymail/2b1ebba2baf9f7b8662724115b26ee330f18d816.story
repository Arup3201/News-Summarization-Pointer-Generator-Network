A couple from northern New York accused of kidnapping and sexually abusing two young Amish sisters in August are now facing 21 additional federal charges involving more victims.

The case against Stephen Howells and Nicole Vaisey now involves six victims, U.S. Attorney Richard Hartunian said Wednesday.

Howells and Vaisey, who live in Hermon, had previously been charged with crimes against three children, including the Amish girls, who were held for a day and released.

The new 21-count indictment had not been filed as of early Wednesday evening, so details weren't available. But Hartunian said Howells and Vaisey are charged with sexually exploiting three children between September 2013 and August 2014.

Howells is additionally charged with six counts involving four children at other times.

The 39-year-old man also is charged with five more counts of possessing child pornography found on five hard drives, including images and videos of children under the age of 12.

'Our goal is that they will never be near children again,' Hartunian told Syracuse.com.

Howells and Vaisey previously pleaded not guilty. Vaisey's lawyer, Bradford Riendeau, declined to comment Wednesday because he had not seen the superseding indictment.

He has said Vaisey, 25, was controlled by her older boyfriend in a master-slave relationship, in which she was the submissive one. Howells has three children of his own.

The 7- and 12-year-old Amish girls were abducted from their family farm stand in rural Oswegatchie after being lured into the kidnappers' car with a puppy in the backseat.

The abduction touched off a massive search in the community of about 4,000 people, but authorities were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls. The Amish typically avoid modern technology, and the family had to work with an artist to produce a sketch of the older girl.

Authorities say the girls were shackled to a bed and sexually abused before they were released 24 hours later and turned up safe at the door of a house in Bigelow, New York, belonging to Jeffrey and Pamela Stinson, who drove them home.

Howells, a registered nurse at Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center, and Vaisey, a former dog groomer, were arrested August 15 after voluntarily going to the sheriff's office for an interview.

The original federal indictment said another young girl, now about 8 years old, also was sexually abused by the couple during the two-year span.

The federal crimes Howells and Vaisey are accused of committing carry a range of prison terms upon conviction, including up to 30 years on the first count of conspiracy to sexually exploit children.

Howells and Vaisey initially were held on a state kidnapping charge following their arrests shortly after the Amish girls were released.

During a hearing in August, Vaisey revealed that she and Howells were on a 'shopping trip' for slaves on the day of the kidnapping. 

St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain said Wednesday additional state charges are possible but she will let the federal case go forward first.

She said she is pleased federal authorities are ‘pursuing charges which provide greater penalties than those New York law affords.’
