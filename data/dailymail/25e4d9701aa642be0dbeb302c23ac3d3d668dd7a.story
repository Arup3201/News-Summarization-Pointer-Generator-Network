Some enterprising New Yorkers appear to have seized the occasion of Banksy's artist residency in the city to make a few bucks.

Video and photos have emerged showing three men who've apparently taken over a corner where a Banksy piece was painted Thursday in East New York and they're charging $5 per viewing.

With a just a flimsy piece of cardboard, the men have turned the activist street artists work into a peep show.

No freebies: Some enterprising Brooklyn men decided to make a quick buck when a Banksy piece showed up in the East New York neighborhood

It's no Chelsea: Many of the eager art lovers showed up to see the Banksy, but left aghast that a man was charging for it

'Chill out!' says one woman in a video from the scene taken by Instagram user capnyc.

A man taking money from eager art lovers carrying cameras yells profanity at the woman as she apparently tries to explain thatÂ  Banksy's work is likely meant to be free.

He tells his business partner to let a woman who has paid him take a picture.

A piece of cardboard is moved away from a cement wall to reveal a beaver painted to look like it has felled a street sign.

'You want to take a picture, its gonna cost something,' the man, who appears to be the ringleader, says in another video. 'Or, the s**t can just get broke.'

Day 10: Banksy has said he intends to unveil a new piece for every day in October

'It don't matter to me. Now what does it matter to you,' the man asked incredulous visitors as he threatened to smash the painting

Good deal? For each reveal, the men charged $5

'It don't matter to me,' he says. 'Now what does it matter to you?'

When someone refuses to pay his fee, the man yells, 'Bye! That means you don't give a f**k about the artist!'

The piece showed up in the Brooklyn neighborhood, known to be one of its most crime-riddled, on October 10.

Banksy began painting and installing his pieces in New York on October 1 as part of a month-long artist's residency on the streets he's dubbed Better Out than In.

On October 9, the British artist's work showed up on the Lower East Side. The work is Banksy's comment on the Iraq war and is a spray-painted car set in front of charging horses wearing night-vision goggles.

The car is surrounded with oil barrels and Banksy has stenciled a number on the side of one.

The phone number takes callers to a disturbing 39-minute recording of an airstrike in Baghdad that was released by Wikileaks in 2010.

Eighteen people, including a Reuters photographer and two children, were killed in the strike.

Whether he meant his little beaver to be a statement or not, it has become a one.

A cultural rift is revealed as aghast art lovers walk away when a man from a tough side of Brooklyn demands their money to look at street graffiti in his neighborhood.
