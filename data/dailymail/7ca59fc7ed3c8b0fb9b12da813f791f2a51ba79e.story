Up to 11 party leaders could take part in election debates after Labour said Northern Ireland’s parties should not be excluded.

Broadcasters last week made a ‘take it or leave it’ offer for a seven-way debate between the leaders of the all the major political parties in England, Scotland and Wales.

It came after David Cameron threatened to boycott the debates unless the Green Party were invited to take part alongside Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip.

The new schedule proposed two debates involving seven leaders – one on BBC and one on ITV – with a third, on Channel 4 and Sky, which would be a head-to-head clash between Mr Cameron and Ed Miliband only.

Along with the Tories, Labour, Lib Dems and Ukip, TV executives have extended the invitation to the Green Party, the Scottish Nationalist Party and Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru.

Labour last week appeared to sign up to the deal – while the Tories and Lib Dems said they were ‘considering’ the proposal.

But a Labour source this evening suggested Northern Ireland’s political parties should not be kept out of the debate.

The source told the website Politics Home: ‘We can see no good reason to treat NI differently to the rest of the UK in these debates.’

If broadcasters accepted the proposal there would be at least eight parties involved – but possibly up to 11 if all Northern Ireland’s parties were also invited.

Sinn Fein – Northern Ireland’s second biggest party – do not take up their seats in Parliament but have warned they would challenge any attempt to discriminate against them.

A party spokesman said: ‘Sinn Fein will take every opportunity to present and promote its policies and positions.’

The DUP's leader, Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson, has written to the broadcasters and Ofcom stating that the proposal is ‘unacceptable’. 

The Tories pushed for the debates to happen in 2010, when Mr Clegg was seen to have have triumphed over Mr Cameron and Gordon Brown

He said: ‘In light of the extension of the debates to smaller and regional parties, the failure of the broadcasters to invite the DUP to participate is inexplicable.

‘The broadcasters' decision cannot logically or legally be defended.

George Galloway, the Respect Party’s sole MP, has also demanded his inclusion.

Mr Farage, who had been the main beneficiary of the original format proposed by the broadcasters, said the revised offer had made the programmes less likely to take place.

‘You can't have a debate with seven people on the podium. And if you are going to have seven, you have got to have the Northern Irish DUP, they are after all the fourth biggest party in Parliament,’ he told Channel 4 News.

‘The broadcasters made a decision, Ofcom backed that decision up: there are four major parties in British politics.

‘Mr Cameron, I'm afraid, has managed to upset the whole debate, to dilute the thing. And I think these debates are now looking less likely to happen than they were before.’

The PM had thrown scheduling plans into chaos after refusing to take part unless Green leader Natalie Bennett was offered a place at the podium.

Her inclusion put pressure on Downing Street to agree to the debates – even though ongoing unrest among other smaller and regional parties threatens to scupper the screenings altogether.

Broadcasters said they had made the changes after reviewing the ‘electoral landscape’ but issued a clear warning that they would ‘empty chair’ any leader who refused to turn up.

The original proposal was for one debate featuring the PM and Ed Miliband, a second including Mr Clegg and a third with the addition of Ukip leader Nigel Farage.

The row over the exclusion of the Greens has sparked an apparent surge in support for the party, which saw it pick up several points in the polls and thousands of new members.

Leader Miss Bennett described the decision to include her party as ‘groundbreaking’ and the apparent surge in support as a ‘Green Spring’.

The group of major broadcasters said that since the initial proposal they had monitored ‘the electoral landscape’ and taken into account polling data and ‘expressions of public support for the debates to go ahead and for a wider range of parties to be included in the debates’.

The proposed dates for the debates are April 2, 16 and 30 – with the final clash exactly a week ahead of the General Election poll on May 7.
