HSBC has been accused of bullying by a carpet shop who claims the bank cancelled their 25-year business account because they have the word 'Persian' in their name.

The bank told the owners of Persian Carpet Studio, based in Sudbury, Suffolk, that they had a month to find a new bank as their business account was being terminated - without any explanation.

The carpet business' secretary, Graham Barber, believes the decision was a result of new money- laundering and anti-terror legislation, which has left banks terrified of providing services to those it deems as risky.

Furious: Shop owners, Sara and Graham Barber, are angry with the way they have been treated by HSBC 

HSBC was recently accused of Islamophobia after pulling the plug on three other 'suspect' accounts including one belonging to the Finsbury Park Mosque, where jailed terrorist Abu Hamza preached.

In an identical letter to the Mosque and two Muslim charities, HSBC told the groups their business was outside the bank's 'risk appetite'.

Retired stockbroker, Mr Barber, said: 'It's absolutely monstrous. This is a bullying major bank.

'They claim they are in the business to support people with entrepreneurial flare, but they closed us down after 25 years with not even a meeting to explain why they are doing it.

'I know why, it's the word Persian but they will not tell us. When people think of Oriental carpets, everyone says Persian.

'We sell carpets from all over the Far East, we just happen to be called Persian Carpets. We do no direct banking with Iran and never have done.'

Mr Barber said HSBC made the decision to cancel their account after his daughter, Sara, the company's founder, bought three carpets from an Iranian businessman at a fair in Hamburg.

Payment for the first two carpets went through but the third was not honoured by HSBC - who wrote to them two days later telling them that their account was being closed.

Mr Barber added: 'That was in April and they wanted it closed by May. It really incensed us, we never had any meeting, no explanation was given at all, no excuse.

'There are not many Oriental carpet retailers and carpet restorers in the country and we are one of the biggest.

'But like all high street businesses we have be careful about our cash flow and this does not help.'

His 46-year-old daughter, Sara, who founded the business, added: 'We never had an explanation as to why. That made me extremely angry, it's been very badly handled.

'We can only assume it's because of the nature of my business, the fact I am importing items that originate from Iran.

The mother-of-one added that it had cost the business thousands in solicitor’s fees to open up a new account with Natwest.

Mr Barber claims the vast majority of Persian Carpet Studio's suppliers are based in London, with only a few in Europe.

After writing to his MP, Tim Yeo, he received a letter from the Treasury which confirmed the shop was 'perfectly in order to sell Persian carpets'.

He added: 'It said we never ever tried to send any money to Iran. We are not breaking any sanctions. The business was perfectly legitimate.'

He has accused the bank of being frightened of a US treasury department who are handing fines to banks linked to sanction- breaking or money laundering activities.

He went on: 'All our banks are so frightened of what the US Treasury department is doing to them, that they are running around like headless chickens and closing down anything to do with Iranian connections.

'Our Government is not doing anything to protect our banking industry. I think the US Treasury is trying to decimate the UK banking industry for their own gain.'

After writing to HSBC's chairman he was told the bank would now only accept correspondence from his solicitors.

In 2012, HSBC were forced to pay £1.2bn to settle allegations it allowed Mexican drug-traffickers to move money around the financial system. 

Commenting on the situation with Persian Carpet Studio, bank spokesman, Steve Gracey, said: 'We do not discuss individual customers, nor do we confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer.

'For context however, HSBC was fined US$1.9 billion in December 2012 by the US and UK governments and entered into a deferred prosecution agreement. 

'We are committed to adopting and enforcing the most effective standards to combat financial crime across our operations globally. 

'This includes ensuring we have appropriate policies for how we do business and with whom.

The bank is applying a programme of strategic assessments to all of its businesses. 

As a result of these ongoing reviews, we have ended relationships with business and personal customers in over 70 countries. 

'Decisions to end a customer relationship are not taken lightly. 

'We take our responsibilities to customers and society very seriously, and remain committed to supporting our small business and charity customers.'
