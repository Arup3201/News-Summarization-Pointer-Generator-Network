If there was ever the perfect example of why you should never talk about your boss behind his or her back, then this is it.

Joseph Lacher, 41, of insurance firm Allstate, was fired after reportedly telling agents in a bar that his boss Thomas Wilson was a ‘f*****g a*****e’.

His $3.2million job as president of the Illinois company’s home and vehicle insurance units came to an end eight weeks later.

Unfortunate end: Joseph Lacher, left, of Allstate, was fired after reportedly telling agents in a bar that his boss Thomas J. Wilson, right, was a ‘f*****g a*****e’

His departure sent the share price down five per cent in a day and executives were told to report directly to CEO Mr Wilson.

Mr Lacher was failing in turning around the home and vehicle insurance operations but sealed his fate in May, sources told the Wall Street Journal.

He was having drinks at a Ritz-Carlton hotel bar in Orlando, Florida, with some of Allstate’s top-selling agents at a company event.

His comments came after an earlier meeting saw the two men reveal plans to shrink the sales force and change commission calculation methods.

Large company: Allstate is the biggest publicly-traded home and vehicle insurer in the U.S., while it also sells life insurance and retirement products

The changes were not welcomed by some agents, and it was later at a bar that Mr Lacher helped end his 20-month career with two expletives.

Sources told the Wall Street Journal his
comments were the last straw because Mr Wilson was already unsatisfied 
with Mr Lacher's performance.

Neither Allstate or Mr Wilson would comment, but Mr Lacher said the firm has ‘tremendous opportunity and I wish them all the best’.

Allstate is the biggest publicly-traded home and vehicle insurer in the U.S.

Mr Lacher, who has a University of Notre Dame degree in aerospace engineering, was paid $3,221,395 last year, reported Bloomberg.
