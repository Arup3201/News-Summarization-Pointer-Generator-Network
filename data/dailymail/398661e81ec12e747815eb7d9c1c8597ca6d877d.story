Channel 4 has been labelled tawdry after paying Holocaust denier David Irving £3,000 for what he says is a lock of Adolf Hitler’s hair.

The strand will be DNA-tested in a TV show to be broadcast this week. Labour MP Ian Austin – whose Jewish father lost his family in the Treblinka extermination camp – said it was a ‘sick’ and ‘tawdry’ stunt.

He told the Daily Mirror: ‘It’s appalling that Channel 4 would get involved with a Holocaust denier in some bizarre and tawdry show purporting to be entertainment. It’s disgusting, and raises questions about Channel 4’s public broadcasting remit.’

Irving, 75, was convicted of Holocaust denial in Austria in 2006 and fined after claiming the Nazi leader did not order the annihilation of Jews. He has praised Hitler as ‘a great man’ and said his Gestapo were ‘fabulous policemen’.

Irving also insulted the memory of victims further in 2009 by trying to sell Nazi memorabilia online – including the hair – allegedly collected by Hitler’s barber using sticky tape on the sole of his shoe.

The hair will be used in Dead Famous DNA – which will also feature Marilyn Monroe, Napoleon and Charles Darwin – which starts on Wednesday night.

According to the Channel 4 website, the show ‘tracks down remains of some of history’s most important and infamous figures and uses cutting-edge DNA analysis to find out more about what made them who they were’.

A Channel 4 spokesman said that the DNA tests could provide a ‘key biological component’ to the dictator’s biography.

He added: ‘We believe the potential importance of the scientific and historical insight justified the purchase.’
