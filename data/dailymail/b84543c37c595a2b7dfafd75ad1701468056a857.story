A Philadelphia mom introduced her 15-year-old daughter to heroin and continued to snort and inject with the girl over a six-month period, driving her to dangerous drug corners over 100 times to score a hit, police allege.

Patricia Davenport, 35, was arrested and charged on Wednesday on multiple counts, including endangering the welfare of children and felony drug charges.

The Lower Salford mother is accused of first giving her teenage daughter heroin in April, when they snorted it off the kitchen counter together in their Harleysville apartment.

The girl then started injecting several times a week by summer, often in front of her eight-year-old brother, according to CBS Philly.

Charged: Patricia Davenport, 35, was arrested Wednesday after allegedly introducing her 15-year-old daughter to the drug heroin and continuing to do it with the teenager for six months

Bad mom: Police allege Davenport went over 100 trips car trips to pick up drugs from dangerous parts of North Philadelphia with her two children and her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend

'Incomprehensible': Police say at one point Patricia Davenport's eight-year-old son asked his mom about the syringe in her hand. She has been remanded in custody

Police say over the course of six months, Davenport drove her two children, as well as her daughter's 16-year-old boyfriend, to North Philadelphia to make drug pick-ups.

She would allegedly inject her daughter and the girl's boyfriend on the way home, police said.

Her eight-year-old son was often in the car and at one point asked about the syringe in his mother's hand, police said.

They made over 100 trips, CBS Philly reported.

Officials have said the little boy was not given heroin.

'His life has been very deeply impacted,' Risa Vetri Ferman, Montgomery County's district attorney, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 

Authorities credit one of the daughter's classmates with telling the school about her suspicions.

The 15-year-old was sent to a guidance counselor, who inspected her and found track marks on her forearms, according to an arrest warrant.

The school then called police.

At a loss: Montgomery County's district attorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, said she can't believe a parent would ever be capable of the behavior allegedly displayed by Patricia Davenport 

Davenport was arraigned on Wednesday, with a strong media contingent meeting her outside court.

She has been remanded in Montgomery County prison on $50,000 bail.

Her children were put in the care of family members by social services.

Ferman said the disturbing case outlines the current heroin epidemic.

'I've been doing this long enough, so I don't get surprised a lot,' she said at a news conference, according to CBS Philly.

'But I'm really at a loss for words.

'It's incomprehensible to me that a parent would introduce her child to these drugs.'
