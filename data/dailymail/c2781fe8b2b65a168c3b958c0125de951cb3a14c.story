Super Bowl advertisers are being careful not to offend with this weekend's television spots, going for cute, cuddly and sentimental as opposed to the sexy commercials of years past. 

The millions who tune in on Sunday can expect lots of puppies and relatable celebrities, as opposed to scantily clad women and sexual situations, with even the Victoria's Secret Angels fully clothed in the brand's teaser spot - although they reveal more in their actual Super Bowl ad.

And an anti-domestic abuse commercial will have a high profile-spot during the game after a year of domestic violence scandals in the NFL.

Budweiser will feature an adorable puppy, and a Clysdale in a commercial they premiered earlier this week

Mindy Kaling will get invisible in an ad for Nationwide

Carl's Jr. is sticking with the sex, and, as is tradition, will feature a model enjoying one of their burgers

That's not all either,  with Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan toning down the sexy and mocking themselves for T-Mobile and Esurance respectively, and one of America's most beloved sitcom actresses, Mindy Kaling, pretending she is invisible for a Nationwide ad that has already been heavily teased.

Of course, they aren't all devoid of sex, with Carl's Jr. going very sexy as usual with a naked model enjoying one of their burgers.

Advertisers have to find a balance between grabbing people's attention and not going too far to shock or offend a broad base of more than 110 million viewers. They want to be sure to make the estimated $4.5 million they're spending for a 30-second Super Bowl ad worth it. This year, that seems to mean erring on the side of caution.

'Companies are being more prudent,' said MediaPost columnist Barbara LIppert. 

'It's also a very weird atmosphere with all the coverage about deflated balls and domestic abuse. Maybe advertisers want to be a little more careful in that climate.'

 Wix.com went for non-edgy laughs with an ad that shows retired football players coming up with funny fictional businesses, like Brett Favre

It's a far cry from the dot.com commercial attempts in 2000, when an E*Trade ad showed a monkey in a garage and touted the fact that the company had just wasted $2 million dollars, but MediaPost's Lippert says it makes sense to be restrained.

Even GoDaddy, which made its name with racy Super Bowl spots since it began advertising 11 years ago, has been moving away from being edgy; last year one of its Super Bowl ads focused on a woman running a small business.

This year, they promised a warm and fuzzy ad featuring a puppy, spoofing a Budweiser ad from last year that also featured a puppy. 

But the twist at the end of GoDaddy's spot showed the puppy was being sold online via a web site created with Godaddy.com. After it debuted early, a social media storm erupted, with pet lovers finding the ad offensive. 

GoDaddy said late Tuesday it wouldn't air the ad.

'At the end of the day, our purpose at GoDaddy is to help small businesses around the world build a successful online presence,' said CEO Blake Irving. 

'We underestimated the emotional response." GoDaddy says it has another ad it plans to run.'

Wix.com, which helps people build web sites, has taken a lesson from GoDaddy. Instead of debuting as a Super Bowl advertiser with a racy spot like GoDaddy did when it was a new advertiser, Wix.com went for non-edgy laughs with an ad that shows retired football players coming up with funny fictional businesses. 

Brett Favre, for instance, invents a charcuteries business called Favre and Carve.

Other companies appear to be playing it safer too by not focusing so much on bare skin and sophomoric humor. 

A Victoria's Secret 90-second teaser ad showed supermodels fully dressed as football players. The actual Super Bowl ad shows the models dressed in Victoria's Secret lingerie, though.

And the NFL is airing a public service announcement from NoMore, a coalition of anti-domestic abuse organizations. The ad depicts a chilling 911 call from a battered woman to demonstrate the terror of domestic abuse.
