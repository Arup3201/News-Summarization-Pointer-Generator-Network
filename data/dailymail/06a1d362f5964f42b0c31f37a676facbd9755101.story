The routine is one that millions of women will recognise; you step out of the shower, dry yourself with a towel, then blast your armpits with a spray of super-strong, all-action, perfume-steeped, heavily marketed anti-perspirant deodorant.

Leaving the house without it would be akin to stepping outside naked.

Au Naturel: Heather Edwards prefers to sweat as nature intended

But not Heather Edwards. This 47-year-old beauty therapist from Oxfordshire hasn’t worn deodorant for seven years. Her armpits are washed and shaved and treated to a light dousing with essential oils, but that is it. She prefers to sweat as nature intended.

And before anyone assumes Heather reeks, she is quick to point out that she hasn’t had a single complaint in all the years she has avoided the chemicals.

Heather, who runs her own salon, is among a growing number of people who dare to leave their armpits unsprayed.

Actress Cameron Diaz said last month she hasn’t worn anti- perspirant for 20 years. Actors Matthew McConaughey and Bradley Cooper claim never to spray their underarms.

Cooper says the body ‘self-cleans’, relying on showers, sometimes several times a day, to keep him fresh and odour-free.

Diaz told her interviewer: ‘Anti-perspirant is really bad for you. Let it go and just trim your armpit hair so it doesn’t hold on to the scent. You’re stinky because you use anti-perspirant. It keeps all the stink in.’

Heather decided to change her lifestyle when her husband Stuart coughed and spluttered as she sprayed the heavily scented fumes one morning.

‘It occurred to me that applying a thick layer of chemicals to my body every morning might be something I should — and could — avoid,’ she says.

In recent years, some scientists have raised concerns about some underarm products.

They fear that chemicals called parabens and aluminium residues that block the pores to reduce sweating could be absorbed through the delicate skin under the arm — particularly after shaving the area — and trigger cancerous changes in breast tissue.

While cancer charities are adamant there’s no strong evidence that either deodorants or anti-perspirants increase the risk of breast cancer, women are concerned.

‘I thought it can’t be healthy to have all those chemicals so close to sensitive breast tissue. I really hated the idea of clogging my pores with artificial gunk,’ says Heather.

‘It wasn’t easy giving up deodorant. My job means I can get quite hot at times, and I can’t afford for my clients to think I smell.

‘I did notice I was slightly sweatier under the arms at first, but I was really fastidious about keeping my armpits clean and hair-free.

‘As far as I could tell, I didn’t smell and so far I’ve not had any complaints.’

At first, Heather used a crystal deodorant stick (around £5 in health stores), which you wet and apply. Fans claim the crystal residues and natural mineral salts inhibit growth of smell-inducing bacteria.

She then switched to an essential oil spray from Neal’s Yard Remedies (£8), which does not contain aluminium or preservatives, but claims to keep levels of  pong-causing bacteria down.

‘It smells divine and I’m confident it works with my body, not against it,’ she says.

Cameron Diaz’s theory about anti-perspirant being the cause of body odour may not be backed by science, but it is true that human sweat isn’t inherently smelly — it is almost odourless.

Any bad smell comes as bacteria break down proteins in the sweat into smaller molecules of acid. We have sweat glands all over our body (2.6 million of them), but sweat that smells is produced only by certain glands (apocrine glands) in the groin, armpits, lip and scalp, and develop at puberty.

Feeling cool: Despite getting hot at work, Heather didn't smell

Dr Marie-Helene Marion, a consultant neurologist and sweat expert at St George’s Hospital in London, explains there are two chemical processes at work in most products.

Deodorants, which spread a layer of antibacterial chemicals on the skin to inhibit the bacterial action, and anti- perspirants, which contain chemicals — usually aluminium salts — to reduce sweating by blocking sweat ducts.

But some people might not need to use anti-perspirant at all. Research studies have shown as many as one in 50 people could carry a mutated gene that means their armpits simply don’t smell.

People with the gene (called ABCC11) are missing a certain chemical in their armpits that odour-causing bacteria feed on.

The only way to know you’ve got the no-smell gene is to check your ear wax. If it’s dry, white and flaky rather than the normal dark and sticky, you might be an ABCC11 carrier.

Or YOU could always just stop using your anti-perspirant and see what happens. Sarah Newson, 36, from Northumberland, did. The mother of two stopped buying underarm products five years ago.

‘I was doing a lot of exercise — running and gym classes,’ she says. ‘I didn’t always remember to take my anti-perspirant to the gym and as the weeks went by it seemed superfluous anyway, as I was only ever a few hours away from my next session and my next shower.’

When she started a family, she found she didn’t need to use anti-perspirant at all.

‘I can be more relaxed because I’m at home with the children, not in an office where I might have to worry about whether or not I smell, but I’m pretty sure I don’t smell,’ she says.

Whether most of us are brave enough to put the theory to the test is another matter.
