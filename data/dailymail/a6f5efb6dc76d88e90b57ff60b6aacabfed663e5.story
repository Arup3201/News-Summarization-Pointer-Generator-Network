A horrifying video has emerged of three men being publicly executed in a town square in Syria.

The footage, filmed in the northern city of Raqqa, purportedly shows Islamist rebels shooting dead government soldiers.

Posted on the internet this week, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed Tuesday's killings.

Horrifying: Video has emerged of three men being executed in a public square in Syria

The two and a half minute clip shows three soldiers sitting on a plinth in the centre of the square, surrounded by masked gunmen.

They are wearing green blindfolds and holding their hands together anxiously as a crowd gathers in the background.

A masked gunman can be seen standing next to a van, reading from a piece of paper - it looks as if he is reading into a microphone.

Killed: After the speaker gives a gesture, a man wearing a dark flowing robe walks up to the first victim and shoots him in the head at close range, before he falls back. He then moves along the line and shots the other two men

Macabre celebrations: The trio are seen lying on the ground twitching as more men pump bullets into them while the militants raise their weapons in celebration

After the speaker gives a gesture, a man wearing a dark flowing robe walks up to the first victim and shoots him in the head at close range, before he falls back.

He then moves along the line and shots the other two men.

The trio are seen lying on the ground twitching as more men pump bullets into them while the militants raise their weapons in celebration.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said: 'Rebel fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Bilad al-Sham (Syria) have summarily executed three men in the middle of a square in Raqqa city,' the Observatory said.

Horrific: The amateur video posted on the Internet on Sunday shows Khalid al Hamad, a founder of the rebel Farouq Brigade who is well known to journalists as an insurgent from Homs, cutting into the torso of a dead soldier

Gory: Brandishing the organs for the camera to see, Al Hamad  continues his rant against Assad's government 

'The jihadis stated that the detainees were officers from the Syrian army.'

The video is the latest in a series of horrifying videos to emerge from the war-torn country.

Earlier this week a clip emerged of a Syrian rebel filmed cutting out and eating the lung of a dead government soldier.

The man in the brutal video identified himself as Khalid al Hamad and insists that the brutality of the regime had driven him to the extreme act.

He was seen standing over the uniformed corpse in a ditch while ranting against President Bashar al Assad.

Using a knife, the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog.'

He then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite.

Today it emerged eyewitnesses and victims are claiming that government helicopters 
have dropped at least two devices containing  poisonous gas on the town of 
Syrian town of Saraqeb.

Doctors say one woman died and seven others suffered side 
effects, according to the BBC. 

US
 President Barack Obama and Western leaders had warned Bashar al-Assad 
that using chemical weapons would be crossing a 'red line.'

Injured:
 A video posted on Facebook and YouTube appears to show victims of a 
Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth suggesting the use 
of sarin gas last month

If the the latest claims are correct it could lead to greater Western military involvement in the two-year war.

Intelligence
 gleaned by both the UK and US indicated there is evidence that the 
increasingly beleaguered regime of Syrian president Bashar Al Assad had 
used the weapons and in particular the devastating nerve agent sarin, 
officials said

Last 
month two Syrian officials have denied the government has used chemical 
weapons against rebel forces, saying the regime had no need for them.

Warning: U.S. President Barack Obama has said 
that the use of chemical weapons in Syria would be a 'game changer' 
while Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said
the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for 
their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalist

Syrian
 official Sharif Shehadeh called the U.S. claims 'lies' and likened them
 to false accusations that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction 
ahead of the U.S. invasion of that country.

The
 CIA believes Syria has had a chemical weapons programme for years. 
There is grave concern in the UK and US that its stockpile of chemical 
weapons – approximately 1,000 tons, stored in 50 towns – could fall into
 the hands of Al Qaeda to be turned on Western targets.

Last
 month a video posted on the Facebook page of a British-trained doctor 
appeared to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at
 the mouth and showing symptoms consistent with a chemical weapons 
attack.

Witnesses said that containers were dropped from an aircraft and scattered their contents across the area.

The video was posted on the Facebook page of British-trained doctor Niazi Habash, who treated some of the Aleppo victims.

He
 said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including 
foaming at the mouth, constricted pupils and difficulty breathing.

They were treated using chemical weapons antidote Atropine, Dr Habash claims.

Experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on Khan al-Assad, near Aleppo.

In the April 13 assault, 15 people were injured.

Four-month-old Yehia, 18-month-old Abu Bakr Younis and adult Ghadeer Neddaf all died from their injuries

The most likely chemical to 
have been used is sarin according to former British Army specialist and 
director Hamish de Bretton-Gordon.

He
 told the Telegraph: From what we've seen and the descriptions of the 
containers being dropped from the air, it certainly seems that the 
regime is using sarin in an unprepared state in these attacks.

'But, as in the Tokyo subway bombings, sarin does not need to be weaponised and placed in missiles to kill.

'It is still lethal when people are exposed to it.'

UK
 Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last month that a soil sample 
taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent.

A U.N. plan for a chemical weapons 
investigation has been blocked because Assad's government has refused to
 grant an international inspection team unfettered access in the 
country.

The government wants the team to inspect only Aleppo and not 
Homs, both sites of alleged chemical weapons attacks that the rebels and
 government accuse each other of perpetrating.

The Syrian conflict started with 
peaceful protests in March 2011, but when these were suppressed it 
gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which, 
according to one opposition monitoring group, has cost more than 80,000 
lives.
