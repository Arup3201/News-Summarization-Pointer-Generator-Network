Around 2.4 billion years ago, oxygen levels increased and gave rise to life as we know it.

Before this time, the lack of oxygen in Earth’s oceans and land would have made animal and plant life impossible.

But now scientists have found evidence of ‘oxygen oases’ that formed before the 2.4 billion year figure commonly cited, suggesting that the first steps toward life may have started earlier than first thought.

Researchers have 'found' ancient oxygen in so-called shallow shelf pools (stock image shown) and shallow seas. They were studying rocks 2.8 billion years old in Steep Rock Lake, Canada. Within the rocks they found limestone unchanged since its formation, which only could have formed with oxygen present

In a separate study, scientists say that life on Earth could have started in volcanic vents on the seafloor.

Researchers have developed a new approach to simulating the processes that may have led to the emergence of cell metabolism on Earth - a crucial biological function for all living organisms.

The research could help scientists understand whether it is possible for life to have emerged in similar environments on other worlds.

Co-author Terry Kee, of the University of Leeds, said: 'What we are trying to do is to bridge the gap between the geological processes of the early Earth and the emergence of biological life on this planet.'

Previously, some scientists have proposed that living organisms may have been transported to Earth by meteorites.

However, there is more support for the theory that life emerged on Earth in places like hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, forming from inanimate matter such as the chemical compounds found in gases and minerals.

The researchers, led by Dr Robert Riding of the University of Tennessee, collected 2.8-billion-year old rock samples from Steep Rock Lake in Ontario, Canada reports New Scientist.

The area they studied was once an isolated shallow sea in which limestone formed.

When analysing the rocks they found that the limestone had remained unchanged for 2.8 billion years - a key indicator oxygen was once there.

Limestone can only form when calcium carbonate - its main constituent - is stripped of its dissolved iron.

For this to happen oxygen must be present, as it interacts with dissolved iron to form iron-rich minerals.

The appearance of limestone pre-dating than 2.4 billion years ago, therefore, suggests that oxygen must have been forming before it became widespread.

The origin of this oxygen was likely bacteria, which pumped out oxygen from cleaner water.

And incredibly these oases were thought to exist for just 5 million years before sea levels rose and the oases were swallowed up.

Dr Robert Riding of the University of Tennessee and his colleagues collected rock samples 2.8 billion years old from Steep Rock Lake in Ontario, Canada (shown). The area they studied was once an isolated shallow sea in which limestone formed. And when analysing the rocks they found limestone that had remained unchanged

Current evidence suggests that eukaryotes, life such as algae [stock image shown], did not appear on Earth until about 2 billion years ago. Dr Riding says 'it is possible that the build-up of oxygen levels in early oases such as Steep Rock could have provided the conditions that first promoted eukaryote evolution'

However, 
the appearance of oxygen at the time would have been poisonous to most 
bacteria, meaning they would have had to evolve a defence mechanism from
 the gas before it went ‘global’.

And
 perhaps this early exposure to the once 'poisonous' gas gave organisms 
the ability they needed to become oxygen-breathers, and gave rise to 
life as we know it.

‘Figuring out just when and where oxygen first accumulated in abundance has been a puzzle,’ Dr Riding tells MailOnline.

‘Our
 suggestion that the limestones preserved at Steep Rock in Canada 
represent a 2800 million year old oxygen oasis is novel because it is 
the first time that an oxygen oasis has been specifically identified.’

Dr Riding continued: ‘Over the past 2,800 million years or more oxygen has built up progressively to the point where today’s oceans are almost entirely oxygenated and today’s atmosphere contains 20 per cent oxygen.

‘Oxygen is essential for eukaryotes (all animal and plant life).

‘Current evidence suggests that eukaryotes (such as algae) did not appear on Earth until about 2,000 million years ago or younger.

‘There is no evidence of eukaryotes at Steep Rock. But it is possible that the build-up of oxygen levels in early oases such as Steep Rock could have provided the conditions that first promoted eukaryote evolution.

‘However, as we point out, the Steep Rock oasis may not have survived for longer than about 5 million years, so the transient nature of these early oases could have been an obstacle to sustained development of early eukaryotes.’

Researchers from the University of Tennessee 'find' ancient oxygen

@highlight

Limestone could only have formed if oxygen had existed at the time

@highlight

But oxygen only began to enter the oceans about 2.4 billion years ago

@highlight

This suggests bacteria began forming oxygen before it went global

And to survive what was then a poisonous gas they would have needed to develop a defence mechanism - ultimately giving rise to life as we know it
