It may be more geared towards PR than performance.

But Aston Martin are set to unveil a 'green machine' that they hope will be the first hydrogen-powered car to complete a lap in an international motorsport competition.

The Hybrid Hydrogen Rapide S will debut at the Nürburgring 24 Hours endurance race in Germany this year, which coincides with the British car company's centenary year.

History-maker? The Aston Martin Hybrid Hydrogen Rapide S will be hoping to be the first of its kind to complete a lap of an international race

But the automaker are intent on proving its green potential for the future on what is one of the most demanding race circuits in the world.

Aston Martin have worked with hydrogen experts Alset Global in the hope of proving a CO2 race lap is possible.

The hydrogen, when mixed with oxygen in the air, will leave only a water-based substance.

The car has a six-litre, V12 engine, with the hybrid aspect being that it can run on pure gaseous hydrogen, pure gasoline or a combination.

Scene: The Nuerburgring, Germany, will be the venue for the Aston Martin's Rapide S' biggest challenge

The Rapide S can reach a top speed of 190mph and accelerate from 0-60mph in 4.7 seconds, however the exact performance on hydrogen only, will be tested to the full in Germany.

However, with the extra weight of the hydrogen canisters - two will be towards the rear of the car and two next to the driver, it is unlikely such performance levels will be reached using hydrogen only.

It is also unknown whether the car will complete any more than the one lap and then revert to it's hydrogen/gasoline combination capabilities.

But regardless of final position in the race, the company will pleased and proud of their efforts - providing they manage to complete a full lap.

The car may well be a hybrid, but if the automobile experts can achieve a hybrid of performance match with positive PR, they could be onto a winner.

The Nürburgring, Germany, will be the setting for hopefully history being made

@highlight

Will be first time a hydrogen-powered vehicle has completed a lap of an international racing competition

Only output from using hydrogen as oppose to gasoline is water, with no CO2 emissions

Unlikely with added weight of hydrogen canisters that car will reach top speed
