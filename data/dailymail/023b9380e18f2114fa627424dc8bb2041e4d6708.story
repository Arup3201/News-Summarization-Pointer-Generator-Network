A superyacht built for Apple CEO Steve Jobs has been impounded in Amsterdam because of a dispute over an unpaid bill to designer Philippe Starck.

Jobs, who died last year after making his name and fortune at Apple, never got to use the yacht - called Venus - but had commissioned the French designer to work on the vessel, which cost more than €100m (£80m) to build.

A lawyer representing Starck's company Ubik said his client had received €6m (£4.8m) out of a €9m commission for his work on the minimalist vessel and was now seeking to recover the rest of what he was owed.

Dispute: A superyacht built for Apple CEO Steve Jobs has been impounded in Amsterdam because of a dispute over an unpaid bill to designer Philippe Starck

Unseen: Jobs, who died last year after making his name and fortune at Apple, never got to use the yacht - called Venus - but had commissioned the French designer to work on the vessel, which cost more than 100 million euros to build

The 260ft yacht was impounded on Wednesday 
evening, the lawyer said, and will remain in Amsterdam port pending 
payment by lawyers representing Jobs' estate.

'The project has been going since 
2007 and there had been a lot of detailed talk between Jobs and Starck,'
Roelant Klaassen, a lawyer representing Ubik, said.

'These guys trusted each other, so there wasn't a very detailed contract,' he said.

Many thanks: Jobs died in October 2011. His 
family gave each worker at the shipyard a custom iPod Shuffle and a note
thanking them for their 'hard work and craftsmanship'

The lawyer representing Jobs' estate could not immediately be reached for comment.

The sleek ship is made of 
light-weight aluminum and Jobs employed the chief engineer of his Apple 
stores to help design special glass that allowed the ship to be 
installed with ten-foot-high windows across the hull.

It is christened Venus, after the Roman goddess of love.

The cost of the superyacht is unknown, though Jobs was obsessed with completing it near the end of his life.

'I know that it’s possible I will die and leave Laurene with a 
half-built boat,' he told biographer Walter Isaacson. 'But I have to keep going on it. If I don’t, 
it’s an admission that I’m about to die.'

Sadly, Jobs, who died in October 2011 of complications from pancreatic cancer, never saw his creation finished.

High tech: There are seven 27-inch iMacs set up on the bridge of the yacht

The Dutch technology blog One More Thing reports that the Jobs family will be on hand for the formal unveiling of the yacht at the Feadship custom yacht building company in Aalsmeer, Netherlands.

Jobs' family gave out custom iPod Shuffle mp3 players to each of the crew members who helped build the yacht. Each one came with a note thanking them for their 'hard work and craftsmanship.'

Among the high-tech features inside the ship are seven 27-inch iMac computers.

Jobs employed renowned designer Philippe Starck to lay out in the interior. 

It is unknown when the breathtaking ship will make its maiden voyage.

Feadship, the company that built Steve Jobs' luxury yacht has been crafting custom superyachts since the 1920s.

In addition to the Apple founder, the company has built dozens of vessels for some of the wealthiest and most famous captains of industry.

Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen bought a 200-foot yacht called the Méduse from the shipbuilders in 1996.

Michael J Saylor, founder of tech company Microstrategy, bought a 150-foot ship called the Harle in 2007.

John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool Football Club, ordered the 165-foot Iroquois in 1998.

Henry Ford was also reportedly a customer, as well as Malcolm Forbes, the founder of Forbes Magazine.
