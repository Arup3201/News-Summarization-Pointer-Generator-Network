Several big name beauty companies have been forced to remove a logo that declares them free of animal cruelty after they decided to sell their products in China.

L'Occitane, Yves Rocher and Caudalie are among the high end brands that can no longer use the internationally-recognised official Leaping Bunny logo to show their cosmetics are free from animal testing.

It comes after the firms decided to start selling to China where animal testing on beauty products for human use is still required by law.

Going global: Big-name beauty brands have changed their animal testing policies so they can start selling their products in China (posed by model)

Cosmetic sales in China increased by 18 per cent to £10billion last year - making it an attractive financial prospect.

But many companies selling their products in the country have been asked to fund animal testing of their products in Chinese laboratories in order for them to be sold to the public.

Cruelty Free International chief executive Michelle Thew said: 'The Humane Standards, symbolised by the 
Leaping Bunny logo, is the most rigorous international cruelty-free 
certification in the world.

'Each company is regularly audited to 
ensure that no animal testing takes place throughout each company’s 
entire supply chain.

'Where companies no longer comply with 
the Humane Standards, the right to use the Leaping Bunny logo is 
retracted.

'Following discussion with L’Occitane, its 
certification was retracted in mid-December.

'Some companies wish to bring ethical beauty to China, however this is not
currently possible until China changes its current policy which requires animal
testing.

'I am disappointed that certain companies have fallen prey to the lure
of the Chinese market and are letting animals pay the price. Consumer pressure
can make a difference.

The Leaping Bunny logo is used by brands that don't test on animals, useful for ethically-conscious beauty fans

'We certify over 400 companies around the world that refuse
to allow animal testing into their products, so there is plenty of choice for
everyone who wishes to eliminate this cruel, unnecessary and outdated practice.

'The only way that you can avoid animal testing in your toiletries and beauty
products is by looking for the Leaping Bunny logo, or checking www.GoCrueltyFree.org.'

Britain banned animal testing in 1998
 and several large cosmetics companies including Paul Mitchell, 
Sainbury's, The Co-operative, Superdrug, Marks & Spencer all have 
Leaping Bunny certification meaning they are cruelty-free.

Hair-care giant John Paul Mitchell Systems pulled out of China after being informed that the company would have to pay for animal tests in order to continue selling its products there.

Paul Mitchell CEO and co-founder John Paul DeJoria put sales in China on hold last year and confirmed they will not sell products in that country in order to remain committed to the company's cruelty-free policy.

Mr DeJoria said: 'Since Paul Mitchell was founded in 1980, we have been cruelty-free.

'We do not conduct or condone animal testing on our products, and we will not attempt to market our products in China until alternatives to animal testing methods have been accepted by the government.

'Paul Mitchell always has been and always will be cruelty-free.'

Leading the way: Marks & Spencer is one of several big UK firms that has cruelty-free Leaping Bunny approval for its own products

Dr Dan Lyons, Campaigns Director of 
internal animal protection organisation Uncaged, said it is down to individual companies to make a stand.

He continued: 'It's a 
fundamental decision companies need to make.

'It's much better if they stick to 
their principles and avoid China, which will put pressure on the 
government to change their own policies.

'It's unnecessary for China to require repeat and totally unnecessary testing on these products.'

Urban Decay has also recently decided to cancel its 
plans to enter the Chinese market after being informed of the animal 
testing requirements.

Spokesman for the charity People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Foundation, Alistair Currie, said: 'We are seeing welcome signs of progress in China but their current animal testing requirements are a major factor pushing up cosmetics tests on animals globally. 

'Companies who have turned their backs on their non-animal testing policies because of the lure of China have regressed a generation: their products are once again being dripped into rabbits' eyes and smeared onto animals' abraded skin.

'While many progressive and principled companies are sticking to their non-animal testing policies, others need more motivation.'

But the revelation that some large name brands are giving up their cruelty-free status to sell to China will come as a surprise to many shoppers.

Even more surprisingly, there are many huge international brands including Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Revlon, which have never been able to use the Leaping Bunny logo because of their animal testing policies.

And while an EU-wide ban on the marketing of animal-tested cosmetics is due to come into force next year, campaigners warn that the European Commission is now contemplating compromises or even delays to the legislation.

Mr Currie continued: 'It's vital that the EU protect its own ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics due in 2013.

'We've led the world on this issue – we mustn't take any steps backward right here in our own back yard.'

A spokesman for L'Occitane said: 'L'Occitane does not and never has tested its products on animals.

'Similarly, we insist that our suppliers certify that none of the ingredients we use are tested on animals.

'We do sell our products in China however and the Chinese government reserves the right to conduct tests, but we are hopeful that this situation will change soon.

'We are actively working with the BUAV, with whom we have a long term and constructive relationship, to influence the Chinese authorities to allow the alternative tests that apply elsewhere in the world.'

Jean-Christophe Samyn, Director of Caudalie UK, said: 'We are against animal testing. We do not test our ingredients and formulas on animals and never will.'
