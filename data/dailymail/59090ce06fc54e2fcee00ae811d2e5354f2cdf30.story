Glass has been found in some jars of Sainsbury’s olives, the store giant said yesterday.

No one had been injured or taken ill after eating the product, but the supermarket said it was recalling its own brand 350g green pitted olives as a precautionary measure.

A spokesman said: ‘Glass has been found in a small number of jars of Sainsbury's 350g 
green pitted olives.

Sainsbury's has recalled its own brand jars of green pitted olives (350g) after glass was found in a small quantity of the product. Customers who return the item to store will receive a full refund

'We take food safety very seriously and have removed
 them from sale as a precautionary measure.

'We are asking customers to 
return jars with a best before date of 13/1/17 to a Sainsbury's store 
for a full refund.'

She said the company was working closely with the
 supplier and an investigation was under way.

The supermarket giant was alerted to the issue through receiving a
 small number of customer complaints - it then removed the product from 
display and issued a public recall.

It was understood that the number of jars in which glass was found was in single figures.

Sainsbury’s was unable to say how many jars had been removed from sale.
