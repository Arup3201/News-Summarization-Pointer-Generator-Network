Steve Powell 'continues to put the community at risk' with violations of his parole, states a new report

Steve Powell - the father-in-law of Susan Powell, the Utah mother-of-two missing since 2009 – ‘continues to put the community at risk’ with violations of his parole, according to a new progress report from the Washington Department of Corrections.

Powell was released from state prison in March after serving 30 months in a voyeurism case, but since his release ‘has made no attempts or shown any desire to comply with the requirements of supervision or change his behavior’ the report states.

It also noted that Powell's actions and lack of cooperation with officials since being released from prison haven't allowed corrections officials to ‘thoroughly monitor his activities in order to maintain the safety of his victim(s) and the community. 

‘Mr. Powell's adjustment to supervision can only be described as extremely poor,’ the report says, while further noting that his behavior ‘constituted an obvious risk to officer and community safety.’

The report recommends 60 days of ‘total confinement’ for Powell. A court hearing on his parole violations is scheduled for November 21, reports KSL.

The violations mentioned in the report are the latest in a series of legal wows Powell, 64, has been involved with since his release eight months ago.

In May 2012 he was convicted of 14 counts of voyeurism for taking surreptitious photos of two young neighbor girls in the bathroom of their home in Puyallup, Washington.

Last month, prosecutors refiled a charge of possession of child pornography against him after an appeals court determined that the charge was wrongly dismissed during his original trial.

Police found Powell in a Jack in the Box in July and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors 

A pretrial hearing on the refiled charge is scheduled for Wednesday and if convicted Powell could be sent back to prison for another five years. 

On his release from prison in March, Powell was ordered to complete a sexual deviancy treatment program and undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation. 

He was also ordered to stay away from places where juveniles are typically found such as pools, parks, playgrounds and schools.

In May, Powell was given a Sexual History Disclosure Examination polygraph and some of his responses were determined to be 'not truthful,' according to the report.

In July, police found Powell in a Jack in the Box fast-food restaurant and he was sentenced to nine days in jail for visiting an establishment frequented by minors, the report states.

In August, Powell's counselor 'terminated treatment' because Powell refused to cooperate with the psychosexual evaluation, according to the report. 

His parole officer determined he was being 'manipulative,' and he was sentenced to 'three days confinement.'

Powell again refused to answer questions about his sexual behavior during treatment in October, according to the report.

He is the father of Josh Powell, who killed himself and his two sons - 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden - in 2012 after attacking them with a hatchet and blowing up their home.

Josh is suspected to have killed his wife, although family members have voiced their belief that Steven was complicit in her presumed death.

Thousands of images of Susan Powell were seized from the home that Steve Powell was sharing with his son in 2011 by police serving a search warrant.

The images - some sexually suggestive - showed the missing Utah mother walking in public and sitting in her car - apparently unaware that someone was taking her picture.

Other images seized during that search included those of the bathing young girls that were used to convict him of voyeurism charges in 2012.

Other photos showed a variety of women, apparently unaware that a camera was focused on them, as they walked along sidewalks, in the park or the mall.

Steve Powell has never been charged with any crimes related to images of Susan Powell, but the files show she was often the focus of his lens.

Some of the images zoomed close to Susan Powell's crotch or her backside, including a set of photos taken through blinds as she's bending over and doing laundry.

Child pornography charges have been reinstated and now Steve Powell faces up to five years in prison if convicted

None of the pictures, which were found on a disc in Steve Powell's bedroom, show her naked.

The folder dedicated to Susan Powell contains nearly 4,500 images.

In journals made public by authorities, Powell describes himself as a 'voyeur' and Susan as an 'exhibitionist.'

He talked about using a mirror to spy on her under the bathroom door, and he wrote about taking sexual pleasure in looking at images of Susan Powell that he kept on his computer.

Powell wrote in his journals about taking lots of video of Susan during a trip to Silver Falls in 2009, and a folder of images from the trip shows only photos of her backside as she's walking.

In one entry, dated a few months before Susan Powell’s disappearance, Steve Powell wrote that he had just woken up 'from a most pleasant dream about Susan.'

He described a sexually charged dream in which Susan asked him, 'Do you think I would make a good wife for you?'

Anne Bremner, an attorney who represents Susan Powell's parents, said the images support the family's assertion that Steve Powell had a concerning attraction for his daughter-in-law.

'When you look at those pictures, it's clearly surreptitious. It's clearly obsessive,' Bremner said.

The family believes Steve Powell knows something about Susan Powell's disappearance, and authorities have described him as uncooperative. 

Susan Powell, who was last seen at her West Valley City, Utah, home on Dec. 6, 2009, has never been found.

Records have shown that Utah investigators handling the case focused their attention primarily on her husband.
