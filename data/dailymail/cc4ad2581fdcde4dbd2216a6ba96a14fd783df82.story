Most new mothers can sympathise with gaining a little weight after childbirth.

Claire Simcox, 48, from Hertford, however, put on four stone during each of her two pregnancies.

At her heaviest, when she was 27st and a size 32, doctors told Claire that she wouldn’t live to her fifties.

But the style-conscious mother still cared desperately about her appearance, spending thousands of pounds on designer sunglasses, shoes and handbags.

She says: 'I was the most stylish fat person you could ever meet. I was a complete designer-holic.

'I had all the latest designer accessories but a lot of the best clothes were out of bounds to me because I was too big to fit into any of the sizes.

‘I was a stay-at-home mum, stuck in front of daytime TV and eating crisps every day. I'd eat biscuits chips and burgers and most nights I'd order a takeaway. 

'I was compensating for my weight by spending more and more on designer gear when I should have been losing weight and getting healthy.'

Claire finally went to see her doctor, who ordered her to lost weight immediately.

Feeling good: Before she dropped an astonishing 15st, doctors told Claire she might not live into her 50s. 'I completely changed my lifestyle,' she says

‘He told me I really needed to lose weight, that if I carried on as I was I wouldn’t make it to my fifties and was at risk of heart problems and diabetes,’ says Claire.

‘I cried and told him I didn’t want to die, so vowed to turn my life around.’

Claire began on a low-carb diet, swapping bread potatoes and pasta for chicken, eggs and lean meat.

Within a week, she had lost a stone.

And, after joining the No 1 Boot Camp in Norfolk, the weight continued to fall off.

'I'd never done any regular exercise before,' Claire explained.

'I'd never been to the gym, so it was quite a shock to my system working out at the camp each day.

'I was inspired by the other women around me - they all became great mates as we all lost weight together.

'I completely changed my whole lifestyle virtually overnight. No more daytime TV and more confidence daily.'

Claire also started visiting No 1 BootCamp's Ibiza retreat.

Over the next few years she lost a staggering 15st - going down from 27st to her current weight of 12st.

As part of her dramatic makeover, Claire also dyed her hair from blonde to black.

‘I would bump into old friends in the street and they wouldn't have a clue who they were talking to because my appearance had changed so much,’ she says.

‘I was thrilled that I had changed so much. It really hammered home just how out of shape I had become.

'Now I love being noticed and rarely go out without killer heels and skintight clothes.

'I know how hard it is to transform your life but I want people to realise that it's never too late.

'I'm fit, single and the happiest I've ever been.'

Claire is training to be a life coach and a motivation speaker at No 1 Boot Camp so she can help other women to lose weight as she did.
