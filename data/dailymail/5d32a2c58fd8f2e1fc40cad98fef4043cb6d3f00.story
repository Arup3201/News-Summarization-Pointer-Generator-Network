The national day brought some un-Australian weather to some of the nation's biggest cities this morning. But a bit of drizzle in parts of Sydney and Melbourne wasn't going to stop committed partygoers from making the most of Australia Day.

And other parts of the land of drought and flooding rains - namely Brisbane and Perth - were turning it on, resplendent in the sunshine.

Thousands of punters braved the gloom in the Harbour City, some waving miniature flags and others huddling together under umbrellas on the foreshore. 

Around 1000 swimmers dived into the water near the Opera House wearing only their trunks and a determined grimace as part of the Great Australian Swim series. They might not have been joined by many private vessels this year, but swimmers certainly had company in the HMAS Canberra. 

One of the Navy's biggest vessels, it blasted an impressive 21-gun salute at midday and played host to a dampened choir of yellow schoolchildren, who sung 'I Am Australian'. RAAF jets roared across the Harbour shortly afterwards but they could scarcely be seen under the dense cloud cover.

Down in Melbourne, conditions were likewise overcast. Despite grey skies, thousands turned out to cheer on the annual parade, which featured marching bands as well as an impromptu Indigenous protest. 

Tennis fans at Melbourne Park  shivered through a wintry 17 degrees and light showers triggered the closure of outside courts.
