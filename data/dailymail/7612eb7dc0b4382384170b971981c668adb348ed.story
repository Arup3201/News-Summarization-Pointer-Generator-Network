HTC may be better known for its smartphones, but the Taiwanese company today revealed it plans to enter the camera market.

In what has been described as a direct challenger to the likes of action camera GoPro and Polaroid's latest cubed device, HTC has launched its first standalone camera, dubbed RE.

The 16MP device, which also records videos in 1080p HD, features a unique cylindrical design and remote viewfinder.

A built-in grip sensor instantly activates the camera when its picked up, and its single shutter button allows one tap to capture photos, with a longer press being used for video recording.

The design also has a 146-degree wide-angle lens, as well as slow-motion and time-lapse recording, with a remote viewfinder that allows users to take shots through their mobiles.

An app, available for both iOS and Android, will automatically back everything stored on the camera to the user’s phone or the cloud to free up space on the camera.

In the future, RE will offer real-time video streaming to YouTube, allowing anyone to share events in their lives as they happen.

The periscope camera, called Re, is curious-looking. 

It stands around four inches tall and the cylinder design means it’s easy to grip and a hidden sensor means that as soon as you touch it, it’s ready to go.

The colour finishes look good and the Re feels solid and classy, much more so that just looking at it might suggest.

Holding it is a strange experience at first, especially as you don’t look at the back of it as you would a regular camera. 

In fact, it’s more akin to the way Victorian photographers would hold a flash aloft. Because it has a wide-angle lens you don’t need to have it in front of your face and it easily includes all that you’re looking at, so there are no worries about framing your shot. 

The lens does mean there’s a slight fish-eye lens effect.

The trigger button, a large chrome button on the rear of the device, means there’s no shutter lag and the simple way of shifting between stills and video (short press for images, long press for video) works well. Still, it’s light and small enough to hide in a pocket or bag easily. 

You can also trigger the shutter remotely from an Android or Apple smartphone, which is handy.

The four times slo-mo looks pristine, though the resolution is 720P, not full HD. The Re is a different product even from the lens-style cameras Sony has launched. The initial results looked promising and it feels good in the hand. 

Though whether the public is ready to embrace a hand-held periscope is anybody’s guess

Alongside its new camera, HTC also unveiled its latest HTC Desire model, the HTC Desire Eye. The smartphone has 13MP front and rear-facing cameras, and three microphones to increase sound quality

Alongside its new camera, HTC also unveiled its latest HTC Desire model, the HTC Desire Eye.

Size: 3.8-inch (96.7mm) x 1-inch (26.5 mm)

Weight: 65.5g

Memory: 8GB microSD included

Connectivity: BLE (Bluetooth 4.0), Wi-Fi, micro-USB, 1/4-inch tripod connection

Camera: 16mp, CMOS sensor, 146° lens, 1080p, 30fps FHD video, 720p, 4x slow motion video, time-lapse video recording

Battery: 820 mAh rechargeable battery (1,200 16MP photos; 1 hour 40 min of continuous FHD video recording) 

The smartphone has 13MP front and rear-facing cameras, and three microphones to increase sound quality.

Back-illuminated sensors capture crisp photos, even in low-light conditions, and dual-LED flash on both cameras means selfies are illuminated.

HTC Desire Eye has a 5.2-inch full HD display, waterproof casing, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and 4G connectivity.

As well as hardware, the HTC Eye has face-tracking capabilities that can follow four people in a room at the same time when using services such as Skype.

In direct competition with the RE camera, Polaroid recently launched its Cube device, a tiny action camera with a distinctive square design.

It measures 1.5 inches (3.8cm) on all sides and can capture high definition video at 1080 or 720p. 

In a similar format to RE, still images can also be taken at a resolution of 6MP with its one-button operation.

Three is the only UK operator to offer the HTC Desire Eye and RE Camera. The camera will also be available from EE from November for £169.99.  

 

The HTC Desire Eye is a big phone (thanks to its 5.2-inch screen) but feels comfortable enough in the hand. 

Snapping selfies is straightforward and the front-facing camera was fast and responsive, even in lower light.

The first thing you notice is a much bigger lens on the front of this phone than on any other, matched by the twin flash.

Video looked and sounded good thanks to Full HD resolution recording on both front and back cameras, and three microphones to pick up all the sound – this also promises better background noise cancellation for audio and video calls. 

The phone has HTC’s trademark BoomSound twin speakers at top and bottom of the screen to enhance sound whether you’re video-calling or playing back footage you’ve shot.

 

Commenting on the news, Ben Wood, Chief of Research at CCS Insight said:'The RE Camera’s quirky design is certainly distinctive, but HTC is going to have to provide some compelling reasons to buy one given most people are already carrying a smartphone with a great camera.

'HTC has doubtless had its head turned by the 3.8 million action cameras that GoPro sold in 2013 but it is going to be a stretch to expect consumers to embrace the RE camera as a compelling alternative for everyday action photography. 

The RE camera has a 146-degree wide-angle lens, as well as slow-motion and time-lapse recording, with a remote viewfinder that allows users to take shots through their mobiles

In regards the HTC Desire Eye, Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at uSwitch.com, said: 'HTC has  unleashed what can only be described as the ultimate selfie phone on the market right now.

'No other mobile maker has yet added a whopping 13MP camera to the front of a mass-market phone, so this handset could well feature under a few trees this year. 

'If priced right, the launch of the Desire Eye could be HTC's smartest move yet - an affordable phone, with flagship features, targeted at a younger market - just as we head towards the present buying time of year.'
