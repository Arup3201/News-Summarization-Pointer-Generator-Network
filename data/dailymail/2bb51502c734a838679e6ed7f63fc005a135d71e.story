She shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's petite model girlfriend on Made In Chelsea and while she was a lot more reserved than the rest of the E4 cast, Natalie Joel is making headlines now. 

Natalie has designed a brand new swimwear collection called Joel Swimwear - and showcases her incredibly toned body as she models a selection of pieces.

The range is described by the professional model and designer as a premium beachwear label dedicated to sexy, elegant and feminine bikinis.

New range: Natalie Joel, who shot to fame as Hugo Taylor's girlfriend on Made In Chelsea, has unveiled her debut swimwear collection

Speaking to MailOnline about her new range, the petite star said: 'Swimwear has always been a huge part of my life. I have been an avid collector since my early teens and having had a career as a swimwear and lingerie model has given me such a passion and enthusiasm for design in this field. 

'I have always enjoyed the feminine form and feel very privileged that I can help women express themselves on the beach and by the pool. I am also very proud to say Joel Swimwear is a British brand. We are very lucky to have our garments produced in England and also having the campaign shot on an English beach.' 

Natalie, 23, has drawn on her cultural heritage and says that she's infused the glamour and richness of the Mediterranean with her British passion for the highest possible design craft.

'I have countless sources of inspiration: inspiring people, art, architecture, literature, history, travel, London - I try and put as much of that into my work as I can,' she said.

'Joel is about been elegant and sexy. I love the challenge. It is such a tiny piece of fabric that you have to make an impact; creativity is key.'

Professional poser: Natalie works as a model, which is obvious from her latest beach-themed bikini shoot 

The debut collection, which is priced at around £140 per two-piece, has seven different colourways and she hopes the 'effortlessly sexy' shape of her designs will become iconic.

The designer, who knows how to accentuate her assets, has made sure her bikini bottoms have been cut in a Brazilian style to emphasise the female form, she explains.  

Natalie says her range  is all about supporting a healthy and positive feminine mind and body. 'Strong and confident girls run the world now! I love Jennifer Lawrence and Natalie Portman. They are both fearless and inspirational. If you can dream it do it. It's this attitude that I bring to my design and my own life,' she said.

Desribing her own style and how it has matured since her Made In Chelsea days, Natalie said: 'I feel that my own style is a combination of elegance and sexiness. I am not afraid to express myself. Having said that I adore comfortable and well made clothes so I am just as happy in a Balmain dress as I am in well fitted jeans and chunky knitwear. 

'I am only 5’2 so I must always be careful to dress correctly so suit my proportions. I am more adventurous now. I was so shy when I was filming MIC and I naturally wore a lot of black. Nowadays I love expressing myself as my confidence has grown.'

Research: Natalie says that she  analysed hundreds of different colour combinations to find the correct balance to suit a wide variety of skin tones ensuring that clients feel 'happy and effortlessly beautiful at all times'

The star showcases an enviably toned physique in the campaign imagery, so what's her secret?

'I love going to work out classes with my girlfriends and cousins,' she revealed.

'We like to act silly and enjoy our workout in a happy way. I think that’s the best way. Funky Bums, Tums and thighs is a personal favourite. Food wise, I try to eat little and often. My diet focuses on fresh and seasonal produce. I am slightly panicking though as I recently discovered Cronuts. Avoiding them is a real show of restraint. If you have ever tried one, girls, you will know what I mean! 

'I try not to deprive myself of anything I am craving though, I think it's important to treat yourself on occasion.'

Natalie joined the show in series three as 26-year-old Hugo's girlfriend. The pair broke up in June but were seen a few weeks later kissing outside trendy hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse. 

Speaking about the Taylor Morris sunglasses designer, she said: 'He adores my range. We have a little bet on to see which will be the best seller. As usual, he always thinks he is correct.'

So will the young designer be gracing our screens again any time soon? 'Right now I am so content with life. I have been given a wonderful opportunity to express my creativity and also demonstrate my business skill.

'If MIC came back around I would never say never but having a fashion start up takes a lot of time and focus.'
