An ESPN analyst and former NHL player who allegedly tried to steer an SUV that was missing a front tyre has been charged with drink-driving.

Matthew Barnaby, of Clarence, New York, was last night driving in a Porsche Cayenne with front-end damage and a sparking rim, police said.

The 38-year-old ice hockey analyst was arrested after allegedly driving erratically, failing field sobriety tests and refusing a breath test.

Barnaby had his license revoked and was given tickets to appear in Clarence Town Court. His lawyer has not yet commented.

Earlier on Sunday he was seen with friends at a bar watching the NFL game between the New York Giants and Washington Redskins.

The former pro broke into the NHL with the Buffalo Sabres during the 1992-93 season and has been with ESPN since 2008.

He also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins, New York Rangers, Colorado Avalanche, Chicago Blackhawks, Tampa Bay Lightning and Dallas Stars.

An ESPN spokesman would not comment while they probe the situation.

Earlier this year Barnaby was arrested
after a domestic incident with his estranged wife - which saw him 
perform 500 hours of community service.

He
allegedly caused $300 worth of damage as he kicked a garage door to try
to enter the home of his estranged wife and two children.

He
pleaded not guilty to five charges including criminal mischief - but 
accepted the community service sentence to have the charges dropped.
