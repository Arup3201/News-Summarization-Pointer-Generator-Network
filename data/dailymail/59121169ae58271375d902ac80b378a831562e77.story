An adorable Boston terrier has walked for the first time after undergoing intense therapy to counter a birth defect that left him unable to even stand.

The cute pet, named Mick, was turned over to the Mia Foundation in Rochester, New York when he was just six weeks old. 

He suffered from Swimmer Puppy Syndrome, which meant he was unable to walk, stand or even sit because all four of his legs were splayed out. He could only lay on his stomach.

But the foundation, which takes in animals with birth defects that might otherwise be put down, agreed to try help him.

First off, they propped Mick up at all times, to take weight off his chest.

They then hung him by a harness to ensure his legs were in the correct position. This happened in 15 minute sessions, four times a day.

Chest: Mick, right, was constantly propped up on a cushion to take the weight off his chest

The intense therapy also included having his legs taped in the proper position for the rest of the day.

But mostly the treatment saw him working his legs in the tub to build muscle. 

Just sleeping on his side was a major breakthrough.

Breakthrough: His therapists taped Mick's legs into position

Sitting: Before long, Mick was able to sit like a normal pup

New world: Then Mick could stand and now he is now able to walk and even run

But the hourly therapies worked wonders. First Mick cold sit up, like a normal puppy. 

Then he could stand and now he is now able to walk.

While his adorable waddle may look clumsy, the help he's received has changed this little guy's world.
