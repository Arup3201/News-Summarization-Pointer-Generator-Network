Tinder has bought a picture sharing site similar to Snapchat amid rumours it is set to add picture sharing to its app.

The firm already offers a 'moments' feature for users that allows them to share pictures with all their matches.

However, the new firm, Tappy, would allow Tinder to allow users to send individual users pictures.

Tinder has bought a picture sharing site similar to Snapchat amid rumours it is set to add picture sharing to its app.

Tappy is a mobile messenger that uses photos and ephemerality to put a new face on text messaging. 

All messages disappear after 24 hours, and Tappy's conversations must begin with a photo.

All Tappy messages disappear after 24 hours, and Tappy's conversations must begin with a photo.

From there, you can turn that particular photo into a chat thread, with a single individual or a group. 

Launched in July 2014, Tappy promised: 'It's like having a live chat room attached to your fun and wacky moments.' 

'We're growing and recruiting like crazy,'  Sean Rad, cofounder and CEO of Tinder told Techcrunch.

'It's incredibly difficult to find talented people to join us fast enough to keep up with our roadmap for 2015, which includes some ambitious plans. 

Rad also revealed Tinder is now seeing 1.5 billion swipes every day, 21 million matches each day, and just yesterday surpassed the 5 billion match mark.  

Tinder Moments is one feature from Tappy is expected to be used in.

The feature, used daily by more than fifty percent of Tinder's users, lets people send all their matches a photo message. 

However, Tinder has never allowed users to privately send each other photos through the app.  

'We're very good at connecting people, but there's this 'what happens after that?' moment that we want to improve,' said Rad. 

'We not only want to get better at the way we use criteria to connect people, but we want to broaden the reasons for connecting in the first place. 

'The Tappy team will help us tackle both fronts, the pre-match experience of creating that first connection and the post-match experience of communicating with that person.' 

Tappy is a mobile messenger that uses photos and ephemerality to put a new face on text messaging.

The new features could also be added to a new 'plus' version of the app.

A new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘undo’ button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service.

The app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called Passport, which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations.

Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations.

The new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations.

While this feature may well be used by well-travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook-ups, the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life. 

 

Tinder Plus will be the premium version of the free Tinder dating app.

It will be rolled out in the UK, Brazil and Germany first on a trial basis.

There is no set date for its launch, but in the beginning Tinder will charge differing amounts for the service to find its 'sweet spot'.

Prices will range from 99cents (62p and £20 (£12.50), before a global rate is set.

Tinder Plus will include an 'undo' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left.

A 'Passport' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations.
