Super Bowl's annual media day is an event where hundreds of reporters and broadcasters quiz NFL stars ahead of Sunday's blockbuster game.

Players are often left exhausted with the number of questions they have to answer from the world's media, but that wasn't the case for one man on Tuesday in Arizona.

Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch spent just under five minutes at the podium in front of a scrum of media and was asked 29 questions, to which he replied every time 'I'm here so I won't get fined'.

Around 200 reporters were crowded around Lynch from up to 15 minutes before he arrived, but the Seattle running back wasn't in a mood to answer questions.

But when Lynch arrived he sat down, set his timer, avoided 29 questions, and then after 4:51 he said 'time' and walked away.

The Seattle running back has been in trouble for his refusal to speak to the media before.

He was hit with a $50,000 fine in November for violating the NFL's media policy and has since been fined over $31,000 for making obscene gestures after scoring touchdowns.

According to ESPN.com, Lynch was threatened with a $500,000 fine if he refused to make himself available for the media day.

NFL players' contracts merely require players to make themselves available to the media.
