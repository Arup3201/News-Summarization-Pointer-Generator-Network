A computer programmer claims he increased his productivity at work by hiring a woman to slap him every time she catches him looking at Facebook.

Maneesh Sethi placed an advert on the classified website Craigslist to recruit someone willing to monitor what he was looking at on his laptop.

The computer expert and writer, from San Francisco, now pays a female employee £5 ($8) an hour to strike him in the face if she spots him wasting time on social media.

Slap happy: Maneesh Sethi , a computer programmer claims he increased his productivity at work by hiring a woman to slap him every time she catches him looking at Facebook

Mr Seethi claims the unusual motivational system has helped him boost his productivity from just 35 percent to around 98 percent during the working day.

Writing on his blog, he said he felt embarrassed after calculating he wasted around 19 hours every week looking at Facebook or other social media websites.

He wrote: 'Humans are social animals - we aren't designed to live and work alone.

'Now that the average worker's job is to sit in front of a computer, often with no supervision, it's no surprise that we are only productive a three days each week.

'Having worked mostly alone, on my computer, I found that the majority of my time is spent unproductively.'

He added: 'Nothing makes me more embarrassed than seeing the amount of hours I spend wasted on Reddit and Facebook chat.

'I figured 'This is stupid, why am I wasting this time doing nothing? When I have a boss, or someone of authority watching me, I always get my work done. How can I simulate the authority figure?'

'Naturally, I believe that an authority figure should have real authority.

Reprimanded: Mr Seethi dodges out of sight after he has been slapped

'So I went on Craigslist, put up an advertisement, and waited to see if anyone would bite.'

Mr Seethi published details on his blog of his Craigslist advert, which was entitled '(Domestic gigs) Slap me if I get off task'.

In it he wrote: 'I'm looking for someone who can work next to me at a defined location (my house or a cafe) and will make sure to watch what is happening on my screen.

'When I am wasting time, you'll have to yell at me or if need be, slap me.

'You can do your own work at the same time. Looking for help asap.

Mission accomplished: The smiling pair go back to work

'Compensation: $8 / hour, and you can do your own work from your computer at the same time.'

Mr Seethi said he was inundated with offers from potential slappers and quickly hired a volunteer he names only as Kara.

He wrote: 'Within minutes, my inbox began blowing up.

'I received 20 emails in less than an hour from people who loved the idea. I read through them, found one that stood out, and hired her to meet me at a cafe the day after.

'The next day, at 9am, I found Kara sitting and waiting for me.

'Pulling up a seat, I gave her the basic instructions - she would monitor me for the next few hours, and make sure that I was staying on task.

'I gave her a list of action items that I needed to accomplish, and made her promise to force me to stay on task.'

A hilarious video on Youtube shows Mr Seethi working in a cafe alongside his new employee.

Kara can be seen slapping him firming around the head when she spots him wasting time online.

The computer programmer claimed the ever-present threat of a physical assault helped him to radically boost his output by staying focused on his work.

He wrote: 'The Slap Challenge added a playful, silly element to working.

'It gave me a non-conventional reminder of what I was supposed to be doing - and it ended up being something I didn't want to happen again.'
