Jose Mourinho has hit out at an anti-Chelsea bias after once again jumping to the defence of Gary Cahill and Willian over accusations of diving.

Mourinho was angry last week that Cahill, Diego Costa and Willian were singled out in the win over Hull for alleged diving, and insisted on Saturday that a new system of video replays to clamp down on the offence would simply favour Chelsea’s rivals.

The Chelsea manager said the focus should instead be on the reckless challenge made by Tom Huddlestone on Filipe Luis, which earned the Hull midfielder a red card.

Mourinho said: ‘You speak one week about a dive that was not even a dive and you don’t speak about Filipe Luis who could be this moment in hospital with big surgery on his knee or leg.’

Ahead of Monday night’s trip to Stoke, Mourinho has again risked incurring the Premier League’s wrath by demanding referee Neil Swarbrick ‘does his job’ at the Britannia Stadium.

Under Premier League rules, managers are not allowed to discuss referees or anything to do with officiating ahead of a game, a move designed to stop the top bosses from piling pressure on officials.

But Mourinho has placed Swarbrick firmly in the spotlight after he was chosen to take charge of the match  against a Stoke side who are regularly criticised for being overly physical.

Mourinho said: ‘I like these matches. It’s no problem — with a good referee that can understand what is aggressivity, or when aggressivity finishes and when the rules of the game start.

‘We need a good, experienced referee who can understand exactly that, because what happens in both boxes in this kind of matches and we need important decisions: what is aggressivity and what goes beyond the rules of the game. But I like it.

‘I know that it is difficult for every team to play this kind of match but again I’m not worried. The referee is there exactly to judge what is aggressivity. And aggressivity I always welcome — it makes the game much more beautiful and difficult.

‘But one thing is aggressivity and one thing is to go beyond the rules.’

Chelsea lost 3-2 at Stoke last season but Mourinho had no issues with the referee in that game or with Stoke’s approach. But he will prepare Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois for the physical strength Stoke are likely to show in challenging him in the box, as well as Diego Costa for the battle he will have with Ryan Shawcross, both of whom are travelling to the Britannia for the first time.

Mourinho said: ‘I will speak with Courtois and we prepare him but the referee is there and the referee has to know what is allowed and what is not allowed according to the rules of the game and the rules of the game are the same everywhere so it should be no problem.’

On Costa’s duel with Shawcross, Mourinho said: ‘One is trying to score goals and one is trying to stop. It depends on the way he tries to stop.

‘If he stops in clean way and is successful, maybe I will be waiting in the tunnel to congratulate him. If he goes beyond what the rules allow, I hope the referee does his job.

‘We are physical, too, so it should be no problem for us. But we want to play football — and I hope the referee does his job.

‘We have our identity. We want to play football, we play beautiful football and that’s what we want to do — but we can cope with physicality, that’s no problem for us. But the referee is there and I’m not worried because he is there.’

Mourinho, though, is still nursing a grievance over the FA’s application of rules, which the Chelsea manager thinks is biased and disproportionate.

There is a panel of former referees who decide on which players to punish after matches on the basis of video evidence.

Last season Manchester City’s Yaya Toure appeared to kick out at Ricky van Wolfswinkel while the Norwich player was on the ground, but the panel ruled he did not have a case to answer.

Asked whether video analysis could cut out diving, Mourinho said: ‘The independent panels don’t do that job well in any case. When you go through to analyse and suspend players by video evidence, it’s a disaster. A disaster. I remember last season — and I don’t want to say the names of the clubs or the name of the players — you had players and clubs punished by panels and you had players and clubs protected by panels.

‘I saw someone kick someone on the floor in the back — no suspension. I saw others with minor things — suspended.

‘Players are punished for silly comments on Facebook and Instagram and players are not punished for other things.

‘So independent panels are the same ones that last season analysed my situation against Aston Villa and I was punished and suspended.’

An FA disciplinary panel fined Mourinho £8,000 last season for improper conduct for going on the pitch at Aston Villa after Ramires was sent off and a melee ensued.
