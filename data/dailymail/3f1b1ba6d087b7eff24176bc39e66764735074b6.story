Spanish and Moroccan police have swooped on a terror group which recruits women for ISIS, arresting seven suspected members in raids across both countries.

A statement by the Spanish interior ministry said four women, including one minor, were detained in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and a male suspect was arrested in the mainland city of Barcelona.

Moroccan authorities picked up two suspected male heads of the group in Castillejos – a town in Morocco near Ceuta, which is known in Arabic as Fnideq.

The cell was in contact with Moroccan commanders fighting with Islamic State who are feared to be planning attacks in the kingdom as well, added the Moroccan statement.

Both Spain and Morocco have arrested dozens of suspect jihadi militants and recruiters in recent years, with networks centred around northern Morocco and the Spanish enclaves.

Women are brought from Spain to north Africa and indoctrinated with jihadist theories.

European authorities have noticed a sharp increase in the recruitment of women from Europe for Islamic State in the past year, with at least 100 coming from France alone.

The women were to be used as suicide bombers or married off to jihadi fighters, said the Moroccan statement.

Accounts from the areas under Islamic State control in Syria describe large numbers of foreign women working as cooks, cleaners and in child care.

European officials say these networks, many of which operate online, target young people in search of their identity with the aim of planting multi-generational roots for an Islamic caliphate.

There are more than 1,200 Moroccans reportedly fighting in Syria, and more than 100 have been arrested upon their return.

In July, Morocco sounded the alarm over the threat of terrorist attacks from those returning from Syria and Iraq and boosted security in public places.
