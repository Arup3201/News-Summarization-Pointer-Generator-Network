A Pennsylvania man has taken has macabre fascination with serial killers and turned it into a business opportunity hawking mementos from known killers to others who share his bizarre passion.

Paul Duffy, who has a tattoo of serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett on his leg, has collected ‘murderabilia’ for years and since last month has also been profiting from his hobby by selling off some of his prized collection.

Some people are disgusted at the idea of profiting from others misfortune, but Duffy sees little wrong with his entrepreneurial efforts.

Duffy, 23, promotes his goods via a Facebook page called ‘Wholesale Murder.’

He says there is a lot of interest in 'murderabilia' because its taboo and morbid.

'There’s a big underground market for it,' he told CBS Philly.

He says he has already sold killers’ artwork, letters and even hair, blood and fingernail clippings.

Items currently for sale include a prison-ID card that belonged to cult killer Charles Manson, pornographic pencil drawings by 80′s Philadelphia sex strangler Harrison Marty Graham and a bag of blood belonging to Japanese cannibal killer Issei Sagawa.

However efforts are underway to have the Facebook site shut down by people who don’t believe he or anyone else should profit from other’s tragedy.

‘Collect all you want, but where I draw the line is when you’re selling items that were obtained from serial killers and high-profile killers for profit,’ Andy Kahan told The Reporter.

Kahan, a victim advocate in Houston, Texas has crusaded against 'murderabilia' sales since he first learned of them in 1999.

‘People who sell these items profit from the pain, misery and grief that (murder) victims suffered and give the killers an infamy and immortality they do not deserve,’ he said.

Duffy says he doesn't mean to hurt anyone.

'We are not throwing it in people’s faces. I sincerely care about these prisoners. They’re still people,' he said.

As well as collecting mementos of murder, Duffy has a tattoo in the likeness of serial killer Herman Webster Mudgett on his leg
