Smith, 29, was transferred to Hollesley Bay prison at Woodbridge, Suffolk, just weeks after being jailed for more than five years

A bank raider who has gone on the run from a notorious open jail was moved there just two months after he was locked up.

Kevin Smith, 29, was transferred to Hollesley Bay prison at Woodbridge, Suffolk, just weeks after being jailed for more than five years.

The bank raider escaped from the jail on Monday just 10 days after arriving.

Smith was part of a four-man gang who stole £34,000 from a Barclays Bank cash point at Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire, in September 2012 after ramming it with a JCB digger in a late-night raid.

Smith, of Spalding, Lincolnshire, was jailed for five years and three months at Peterborough Crown Court in July.

Smith was jailed for conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to steal a motor vehicle.

He had been remanded in custody since being arrested last December, which could explain why he was moved so quickly to the low-level security facility.

The Prison Officers' Association (POA) last night branded the decision to move him there 'absolutely ridiculous'.

The organisation also warned that fast-tracking inmates into insecure open jails is putting the public in danger.

Glyn Travis, POA assistant secretary and spokesman, stormed: 'It's absolutely ridiculous.

'This demonstrates that the tick-box mentality of allocating prisoners is not fit for purpose and puts the public at risk.

Prison staff contacted police at 5.45pm on Monday to report that he was not present at a 5pm security check

'The observation, classification and allocation of prisoners is outdated, inefficient, and doesn't do anything to serve the public.'

He added: 'The Government prison quota closure programme will do nothing other than endanger the public because prisoners are being moved down (to open prisons) far too early in their sentences and will no doubt commit more crimes at a significant cost to the taxpayer.'

Prison staff contacted police at 5.45pm on Monday to report that he was not present at a 5pm security check.

Lifer Gregory Dennett, 43, also went missing from Hollesley Bay on Monday - bringing the total for the last year to 12.

Dennett had been behind bars for nine years after carrying out a homophobic attack in Luton, Bedfordshire.

He failed to return after being given resettlement leave to Luton.

Dennett was serving a life sentence for wounding with intent to do GBH.

Police have warned the public not to approach either men, but to telephone 101 if anyone knows their whereabouts.

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'The number of absconds from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began, but we are determined to do more.

'We are working on plans to put prisoners on temporary release on a tag, which will allow us to better track their movements and enforce curfews and exclusion zones.

'This will ultimately help us to protect the public better.

'Anyone who does abscond - or fail to return to prison after a period of temporary release ~ will be returned to a closed prison and may face further criminal charges.'

Disgraced peer Jeffrey Archer served part of his four-year sentence at Hollesley Bay.

Lord Archer was freed in September 2003 after two years after being jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice.
