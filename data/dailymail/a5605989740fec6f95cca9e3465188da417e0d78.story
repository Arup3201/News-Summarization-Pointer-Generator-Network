Victor Wanyama wants to follow Mauricio Pochettino from Southampton to Tottenham.

The Kenyan midfielder made it clear his week that he felt Saints should have done more to keep the Argentinian boss.

Wanyama has benefited under Pochettino's coaching where he has been used as a defensive screen in midfield and has notably reduced the number of goals Southampton concede when in the side.

He joined for £12million last summer and has struggled to settle though Pochettino has become a key figure in his career.

Wanyama said: 'I learnt a lot from him, he taught me more and that's why I have grown as a player and there is a big difference compared to when I was at Celtic. Talking to Capital Sport, he added: 'He played a big role in my career development.

'I wanted him to remain because he had the passion for the club and I think the owners should not have let him go because the team can do better next season. It's a big blow because he had good connection with the players.'

Southampton already have offers for Luke 
Shaw and Adam Lallana while Jay Rodriguez, Dejan Lovren, Morgan 
Schneiderlin, Calum Chambers and Rickie Lambert are all attracting 
attention from other clubs too. Southampton's board cannot afford to let
 all of them go despite the temptation and that could affect Wanyama's 
hopes.

The 22-year-old had also been the subject of interest from Manchester City earlier in the season but they have been looking at other targets and a move to White Hart Lane would be his ideal.

Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger said: 'We are in control of all the player transfers. All the top players are under long term contracts. Any transfers that take place will be under our terms. We will decide the terms to potential transfers in and out of the club.

'We will involve the manager. That is important for everybody to know. That's why we have been able to not agree to any transfers to date, because we have control of the situation, and anybody who is saying anything else doesn't understand that we are in a strong position with the Saints.'

Erik Lamela will not be allowed to leave Tottenham on loan but the club are willing to sell for around £25million. That's the information being 
circulated around Italian clubs at the moment and was reported on Sky 
Italia on Thursday. Lamela's fortunes may change though under the tutelage of 
Mauricio Pochettino, who knows the player well.

Spurs misfit 
Roberto Soldado remains keen to go with Atletico Madrid very much in the
 frame. They have an interest in Romelu Lukaku but the Chelsea striker 
is understood to be reluctant to go to Spain.

Franco Baldini's role at Tottenham remains under question.

Manchester City have taken encouragement in developments with Mehdi Benatia at Roma.

Sportsmail reported City's interest in Benatia earlier this month as an alternative to Eiaquim Mangala of Porto who has declared a desire to join Chelsea.

Benatia, 27, is facing a fine from his club after an outburst in the Italian papers regarding the club's contract offer. The France-born Morocco defender said: 'I never said I want to leave. But Roma have not kept their promises. They had told me that they would make me a new contract offer if I had a great season.

'My agent is doing his job, I could go away but I could also stay and finish my career in Roma. But I was disappointed (with the new wage offer), I deserved more respect.

'I have received an unacceptable proposal, less than €3million per season. I replied that I would not sign it.

'I'm in love with Roma, I'm very fine here but my mistake was to be too correct with the club and too honest.'

Regarding speculation about him leaving, he added: 'I only said that anyone dreams of teams like Real, Bayern and City.

'My agent is doing his job, I could leave but I could also stay and finish my career in Roma. But I was disappointed (with the new wage offer), I deserved more respect.'

City remain interested in Malaga goalkeeper Willy Caballero also as competition for Joe Hart with Costel Pantilimon ready to look at a new club with Arsenal among those to have shown interest - although they have a few names on their list.

City are also understood to be exploring the possibility of 
signing David Villa for their New York City franchise. Villa, 32, has 
just won the Spanish league title and is looking at his next challenge.

City's franchise will be ready next year and they are recruiting big 
names now. Carles Puyol and Xavi have also been mooted with 
both players keen on the MLS project.

Sportsmail revealed that David 
Beckham was keen to get Xavi involved in his Miami franchise but that 
may be too far ahead for the 34-year-old. Xavi is due to hold 
talks over his future with new coach Luis Enrique prior to making his 
decision.

Wigan
 are showing an interest in Chelsea midfielder George Saville. The 
20-year-old is in the final year of his contract Stamford Bridge and 
they are ready to sell rather than loan him out again.

Saville had a 
successful loan spell at Brentford last season and Uwe Rosler has kept 
him mind ahead of his plans for the Championship next season.

The German is keen to stay at the DW Stadium and build for promotion again after going so close this year.

Saville
 is also attracting interest from Wolves and Chelsea would be looking 
for around £750,000 with the price eventually rising to £1million.

Former Liverpool and Oldham 
goalkeeper Dean Bouzanis will return to Australia after signing a 
two-year A-League deal with the Western Sydney Wanderers.

The 23-year-old has spent the past seven years playing in Europe and joins the fledgling club from Carlisle.

Bouzanis
 moved abroad in 2007 to link up with Liverpool and will join up with 
former Crystal Palace defender-turned-coach Tony Popovic.

He said: 'I've seen how good a coach Popa is with the results that he's got, and it all just went from there.'

Premier League and Championship clubs are keeping a check on St Patrick's Athletic winger Christopher Forrester. Scouts are expected at Friday night's game in Dublin with Derry City and the 21-year-old is understood to be the main attraction.

Everton and Sunderland have a long-held interest but West Ham and Leeds have also checked on his progress.

He has chipped in with some spectacular goals notably a 35-yard lob against Drogheda last month and St Patrick's rate him at around £200,000.
