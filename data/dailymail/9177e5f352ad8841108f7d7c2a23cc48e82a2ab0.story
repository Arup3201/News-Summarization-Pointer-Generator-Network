The new female face of the popular U.S. sport of drag racing is being hailed at the 'next generation driver' and already gaining the attention of lucrative sponsors.

Courtney Force - the youngest of four daughters is following in her father John Force's footsteps - one of America's most successful drag racers.

Miss Force will be making her debut in the most prestigious racing series of the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) - marking a breakthrough for women drivers in the sport long dominated by men.

Women drivers have participated in other forms of racing such as Formula One, where Maria Teresa de Filippis from Italy was the first to compete in a race in Monaco in 1958.

But the category of drag racing - also known in the industry as Funny Cars - was dominated by Miss Force's father, a 15-time national champion.

The 23-year-old recalled last week how she used to dream of racing her father by drawing pictures of herself in a car alongside him in a long skinny-nosed dragster.

She now has a promising 
career in her own right as she was rewarded with a new car - a Traxxas 
Ford Mustang on graduating from college.

The fierce vehicle lets her hit 300mph within seconds of flooring the 
accelerator.

She told The Sunday Times: 'Now I get my own 8,000hp, 300mph Ford, I can't wait to start beating up on the boys, especially my dad.'

A passion for racing clearly runs in the family as Courtney's elder sister Ashley was the first to demonstrate that female racers could compete successfully with men when she became the first woman to win a Funny Car event in 2008.

She exceeded 300mph, beating her father in the final quarter-mile event.

John Force, 62, is looking forward to competing against his daughter

Mike Jenkins of Traxxas, a maker of remote-controlled cars, which this year is sponsoring Courtney Force said: 'We are all motorheads, racers and adrenaline junkies.

'Our driver is Courtney Force, NHRA's newest hero. She's not just another girl at the racetrack, she's a girl that has real John Force DNA embedded in her and it shows'.

Force's popularity coincides with the success of established racing star, Danica Patrick, an American auto racing driver cited as a potential future Formula One racer.

The 29-year-old will be taking part in the Nascar Sprint Cup this season - the most prestigious U.S. stock car racing series.

Currently the most successful driver in U.S, automobile racing history, her third-place finish at the 2009 Indianapolis 500 is the best performance by a woman at America's most famous racing circuit.

Miss Force said: 'I loved going to the races as a kid and getting dirty working on the car, grease all over me.

'I have my girlie side too by I loved being a tomboy at the track.'

John Force who is still competing aged 62 said he looked forward to racing against his daughter.

'She's my baby girl, but she's on her own now.'
