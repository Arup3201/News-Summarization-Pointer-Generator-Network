A mother lied about four of her children being disabled to cheat £45,000 in benefits.

Marie Barber, 29, received tax credit top-ups in a scam which played two government departments off against each other.

The mother of six cried as she was told by judge Robert Atherton: 'Those people who have children who are disabled would be outraged.

'You did it for your own benefit - every
household in the country no doubt would say they would like to have 
more than they have got.'

Barber pretended that the children, aged between six months and eight, had 'severe' conditions in calls made to tax credit helplines over a three-year period.

In reality, all of her children were able-bodied.

At the time, Barber, of Worsley, Greater Manchester, was receiving disability living allowance for depression, and used her knowledge of the system in a series of frauds.  

Manchester Crown Court was told her husband, who she has since split up with, was earning around £23,000 a year throughout.

The tax credit system is run by Revenue and Customs and designed to help working families with low or uncertain incomes.

Barber, who began cheating the system in 2007, also lied about the amount of disability living allowance she was getting herself to increase her tax credit entitlement.

She also falsely claimed that her husband's wages had almost halved two years in a row.

By doing this, she boosted the amount of tax credits she was paid by more than £10,000 a year.

She was finally exposed by Revenue and Customs checks which revealed no disability living allowance award had been made for any of her children.

Barber pleaded guilty to ten offences against the Tax Credits Act. 

She was given a 52-week sentence, suspended, for two years.

Mike O'Grady, assistant director of Revenue and Customs' criminal investigations team, said, 'The vast majority of our customers are honest and claim only what they are entitled to, and we owe it to them to investigate and pursue fraudsters who cheat the system through pure greed.'
