These are some of the world's largest trees, rising majestically out of the snowy slopes along the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

Photographer Michael Nichols spent two weeks capturing images of the 'President' - the world's second-biggest tree which is at least 3,200 years old in Sequoia National Park, deep in the southern region. 

Sequoias only grow on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range which runs 400 miles through Nevada and California. Giant sequoias can reach 247-feet - the height of a 20-storey building.

Taking on the president: The world's second largest tree, a sequoia dubbed the president, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range

Tree of life: Sequoias are particular to the region and can grow as tall as 20-story buildings

Writer David Quammen's article accompanies the photographer's series. The following is an excerpt from the December issue of National Geographic magazine: 'It’s not quite the largest tree on Earth. It’s the second largest.

Stunning: The December issue of National Geographic Magazine

'Recent research by scientist Steve Sillett of Humboldt State University and his colleagues has confirmed that the President ranks number two among all big trees that have ever been measured—and Sillett’s team has measured quite a few.

It doesn’t stand so tall as the tallest of coast redwoods or of Eucalyptus regnans in Australia, but height isn’t everything; it’s far more massive than any coast redwood or eucalypt. 

'Its
 dead spire, blasted by lightning, rises to 247 feet. Its four great 
limbs, each as big as a sizable tree, elbow outward from the trunk 
around halfway up, billowing into a thick crown like a mushroom cloud 
flattening against the sky.

'Although
 its trunk isn’t quite so bulky as that of the largest giant, the 
General Sherman, its crown is fuller than the Sherman’s. The President 
holds nearly two billion leaves.

'Trees
 grow tall and wide-crowned as a measure of competition with other 
trees, racing upward, reaching outward for sunlight and water.

And a 
tree doesn’t stop getting larger—as a terrestrial mammal does, or a 
bird, their size constrained by gravity—once it’s sexually mature. A 
tree too is constrained by gravity, but not in the same way as a condor 
or a giraffe.

'It
 doesn’t need to locomote, and it fortifies its structure by continually
 adding more wood.

Given the constant imperative of seeking resources 
from the sky and the soil, and with sufficient time, a tree can become 
huge and then keep growing. Giant sequoias are gigantic because they are
 very, very old.'

Immense: The tallest sequoias are so large that it is impossible to look at them in one go

Intrepid: A researcher climbs a sequoia as part of an effort to measure and map the giant trees

Survivors: Many of the most impressive trees were destroyed soon after they were discovered by settlers in the 19th century

Gorgeous: The majestic plants are considered one of the greatest natural wonders in the U.S.

The 'rusty red' tree has a footprint 
as large as a room in an average home, and is so huge that it is almost 
impossible to look at.

Their giant size allows them to 
survive disasters which would wipe out many of their woodland 
competitors - they are unaffected by storms, resistant to forest fire 
and can live even after being struck by lightning.

And the trees never stop growing even
 when they are hundreds of feet tall - in fact, their rate of growth has
 been found to increase the older they are.

The trunk is constantly widening, while the upper limbs grow stronger even as the trees age.

Steve Sillett and his helpers proved 
this unexpected finding by climbing up the biggest trees and measuring 
them more thoroughly than had ever been done before.

Discovery: The trees were a source of huge fascination when they were found by settlers

Destruction: The early settlers were not afraid to cut down the giant trees for timber

The
 giant sequoia - Sequoiadendron giganteum - tends to live for many 
centuries, enabling it to grow larger than any other species of plant.

The
 trees are naturally found only in a small area of the Sierra Nevada in 
California, nearly all of which is covered by the Giant Sequoia National
 Monument.

While they 
have been successfully grown in other areas of North America and around 
the world, nowhere have they been standing long enough to challenge the 
size records set by the Sierra Nevada giants.

They can live for up to 3,500 years, reaching heights comparable to skyscrapers.

The
 tallest trees currently standing include the President, the General 
Sherman and the General Grant, all above 240ft - but they are far from 
the tallest known in history.

Soon
 after the sequoia was discovered by American settlers in the early 19th
 century, many of the most impressive specimens were cut down and 
exhibited to gawking crowds.

One
 of the biggest of them all was known as the Mother of the Forest, which
 stood in the area from 668 BC and was discovered by George Gale in 
1852.

He stripped the bark of the tree, leading to its swift demise, while a forest fire in 1908 destroyed what was left.

Champion: The General Sherman is the tallest tree in the world still standing, at a staggering 275ft
