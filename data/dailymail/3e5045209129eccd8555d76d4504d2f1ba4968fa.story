A husbandÂ who smothered his sick wife to end her suffering has been spared prison by a judge who described the case as 'desperately sad'.

John Crout, 63, killed his wife Sheila, 65, with a pillow as she slept on the sofa, before trying to commit suicide.

When he was pulled from the edge of a bridge, he told police officers: 'I have put my wife to sleep. She's not in pain any more.'

The couple, who met as teenagers and had been married for 44 years, had been looking forward to their retirement, but Mrs Crout's health deteriorated rapidly, leaving her barely able to move.

Her husband was handed a 12-month sentence suspended for two years after admitting manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. Judge Paul Sloan told him: 'This is a desperately sad case. You were devoted to your wife and regarded her as your soul mate.'

Mrs Crout had become housebound after developing severe arthritis and suffering from migraines.

The extent of his wife's suffering became apparent to Crout as he spent a prolonged period of time at their home in Brenwell, Newcastle, following a hip operation.

Mark Guiliani, prosecuting, told Newcastle Crown Court: 'She was in so much pain she could barely walk and she was more or less immobile.'

Crout was also suffering from a depressive illness and anxiety at the time he killed his wife, which was confirmed by psychiatrists.

The judge added: 'The reason you acted as you did was because of mental illness.'

Crout was stopped by police on Newcastle's Tyne Bridge, where he had travelled immediately after the killing, on June 25. Officers later arrested the distraught husband after finding Mrs Crout's body during a search of the house.

Describing the case as 'tragic', Crout's barrister Nicholas Lumley QC said: 'He met Sheila when he was 15. They had children and grandchildren together.

'They were looking forward to a well-earned retirement. But Sheila deteriorated physically and did not improve. Things were bad and it was against that background why he did what he did.

'Life was not worth living and he fully intended to end his life after ending his wife's.'

Mr Lumley added: 'His mental health has improved and his relationship with his family is as good as it can be under the circumstances. No one here is baying for heavy retribution.'

The barrister said credit should be given to Crout for his honesty from beginning to end, as he immediately admitted what he had done and did not try to sugar-coat his actions.

In a victim impact statement, the Crouts' daughter Nicola said: 'We fully understand that my father was suffering from a depressive illness. He was thinking he was doing the best for his wife by putting her out of her misery and pain.

'If my dad had not been as unwell as he was, he would not have harmed a hair on my mother's head. We all still love my father dearly and will continue to support him throughout.

'We all miss my mother Sheila terribly. We wish she was still with us.'

In a statement read out to the court, Crout said: 'I am very sorry for what I have done. I had no control over what happened.

'It's like a dream when I look back. All I have ever done in my life has been for Sheila.'
