Behind bars: PIP boss Jean-Claude Mas has been jailed while he awaits trial over the breast implant scandal after failing to pay his £83,000 bail (file picture)

The former multi-millionaire businessman at the centre of a worldwide breast implant health scare was behind bars today after failing to pay his bail money.

Jean-Claude Mas, 72, is facing a range of charges in his native France relating to the collapse of his Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) business.

Thousands of women, including many in Britain, want to sue him after the implants were found to have been filled with industrial silicon and were linked with a range of illnesses.

Mas was arrested earlier this year, but released from police custody on January 27 on bail of 100,000 euros (£83,000).

But after he failed to pay all of the bail money, police revisited him on Monday and took him to Baumettes prison in Marseilles.

He will remain there indefinitely until his trial for causing 'involuntary injuries', and also faces a charge of 'causing bodily harm'.

The French authorities took all the implants off the market in March 2010 because of concerns about the way they leaked so easily.

Last December, health officials in Paris recommended that all the implants should be surgically removed.

British health secretary Andrew Lansley has also ordered a review of the possible dangers, urging concerned women to visit their GPs.

Accused: The 72-year-old faces trial on charges of causing 'involuntary injuries' and bodily harm' after his cut-price implants were linked to various illnesses

Mas has, meanwhile, accused women who are trying to sue him of doing so solely 'for the money'.

He insists that there was nothing wrong with the cut-price implants which, at the height of his career as a medical supplies businessman, made him a millionaire many times over.

Mas has since claimed that all the money has gone, although investigators believe that much of his fortune was simply passed on to Dominique Lucciardi, his former girlfriend, and their two grown-up children.

Cheap: Thousands of women, including many in Britain, want to sue Mas over the implants, which contained a substandard gel that enabled him to save the company about £1million a year

Mas, a former travelling salesman who started out selling meat and wine, founded PIP in 1991 to take advantage of the booming market for cheap cosmetic implants.

Using a substandard gel enabled him to save the company about £1million a year and still increase sales.

A French police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that Mr Mas was arrested for not meeting his bail conditions. He is currently being held in prison in Marseilles.'
