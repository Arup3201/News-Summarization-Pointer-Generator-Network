A Saudi Arabian princess has caused a potential diplomatic row by seeking political asylum in the UK because she fears for her safety in her home country.

Princess Sara bint Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the niece of Saudi Arabia's ruler, is living in London after claiming she is being persecuted by her own family and the Saudi authorities.

The mother-of-four has accused senior Saudi officials of plotting to kidnap her and get her back to Riyadh, following 'baseless' claims she has sided with Saudi Arabia's political opponents.

Claims: Princess Sara said she wants to stay in the UK as she has been assaulted, threatened and persecuted by her family and members of the Saudi authorities

The 38-year-old also says to have been assaulted and threatened, and that there have been abduction attempts made against her children, all for political reasons.

Princess Sara, the pampered granddaughter of the Kingdom's founder, is now seeking political asylum in the UK and is living in a five-star London hotel with her four children and two dogs.

UK ministers will have to assess her claims and decide whether to offer her asylum, thereby defying Saudi officials who want her to return to her native country.

Princess Sara has already lived in the UK since 2007, after falling out with her 80-year-old father, Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud.

She has also been locked in a long-running inheritance battle with her brother, Prince Turki bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, over their dead mother’s £325 million fortune.

Princess Sara said in a statement she wanted political asylum as her and her children's leave to stay in the UK had expired.

She said: 'So, with deep regret, and 
as I have been left with no other choice, I have written to the UK Home 
Office to indicate that I, and my children, wish to be granted political
 asylum.

'My reputation has been besmirched in the media by a baseless and malicious smear campaign.

'For
 years I have endured all this in silence, while trying to resolve my 
situation with dignity through the normal channels, without fanfare or 
publicity.

'But my pleas to 
the Saudi authorities in the Kingdom have been obstructed and denied, 
and the Saudi embassy in London has turned its back on me.'

Princess
 Sara went on to say that she has 'nothing but respect for my uncle King
 Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and the 
people of Saudi Arabia'.

'All
 I have ever sought is my legitimate rights, so that my children and I 
can resume our lives with dignity and I can resume my civil society and 
development work.'

Princess 
Sara told the Sunday Telegraph the incident which saw her fall out with 
her father 'shook her world', but would not reveal more details about 
it.

Describing their relationship, she said: 'Everything goes back to a certain aspect that I don’t discuss in public. Something happened with my father and he didn’t take it lightly.

'He retaliated against me and wanted to crush me. I had been his closest; I had been his favourite.'

The Sunday Telegraph quoted a Saudi embassy diplomat as saying: 'The embassy has been involved in settling her visa issue and residency issue in the UK. We have tried to settle this issue.

'This matter is of a personal nature so there is only so much the government can do. It’s not a political matter.'
