Volte face: Sue Marsh campaigned against cuts before taking a £75,000-a-year job with the firm used by the Government to reform disability benefits

A leading campaigner against welfare cuts who claimed to be too sick to work has taken a £75,000-a-year job with the firm used by the Government to reform disability benefits.

Sue Marsh, a darling of the Left who has railed against Iain Duncan Smith’s reforms for the last five years, has been recruited by Maximus, the US company that has taken over a controversial ‘fitness for work’ test for benefit claimants.

Her extraordinary volte face has shocked and infuriated supporters, who have branded her a ‘Judas’ and a ‘sell-out’.

Mrs Marsh said she had undergone an ‘enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift’ that had led her to accept a job as the company’s new ‘head of customer experience’.

She had previously claimed that in Maximus, the Department for Work and Pensions had sought out the ‘worst provider they could find’ to assess claimants of disability benefits.

Mr Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, welcomed Mrs Marsh’s decision to jump ship and take a lucrative position with the firm.

‘I would be the first person to congratulate anyone who gets a job. I'm sure there will be some whose negative attitudes to our reforms mean they will criticise her move. They should be ignored,’ the minister told the Daily Mail last night.

Mrs Marsh ran a blog which she called the ‘Diary of a Benefits Scrounger’, detailing her own efforts to be declared unfit for work because of Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory bowel condition. She was eventually placed into the ‘support group’ for employment and support allowance, the main sickness benefit, which is for people judged e unable to work or even to attend interviews.

She was an architect of the Spartacus campaign, which produced a series of reports accusing the Government of cruelty and incompetence in its efforts to cut the welfare bill and was championed on Twitter by supporters including Lord Prescott, Alastair Campbell, Stephen Fry and Billy Bragg.

Mrs Marsh appeared at the Labour Party’s annual conference in 2013 and wrote regularly for the Guardian.

Announcing her new job, she admitted she had ‘agonised’ about how to tell her supporters of her decision. Late last year, Maximus was awarded a three-and-a-half year contract to take over delivery of the ‘work capability assessment’ – the test of claimants’ ability to work -- from the much-criticised Atos Healthcare.

Mrs Marsh insisted said she was motivated only by a desire to improve the system.

‘Those who doubt my intentions and goals and those with different goals to mine will almost certainly be critical, and, in a sense, I understand that response. If I didn't know me I might be sceptical too,’ she added.

Mrs Marsh said her own, successful application to be declared eligible for sickness benefits had been ‘threatening and scary’.

But she insisted: ‘It is not inherently a good thing for support group numbers to be high. If some of those people who qualify would actually rather like to work, but are terrified of an intimidating and farcical system of support, that actually leads to a life of fear of change,’ she said.

‘We are coming up to an election period. There will be a hiatus and a time to breathe and take stock. There is a new provider, Maximus… If there was ever a time to get significant and valuable changes to what now seems universally accepted to be a system that is in serious need of better delivery, it is now.’

She said Maximus had given her ‘fairly free rein to devise a strategy to bring about a wide range of improvements to the service from a customer perspective’.

‘Of course there are considerable benefits to both myself and Maximus in this development. I will be giving the same 300 per cent passion and commitment to them that I have been giving to campaigning.

‘Crucially, it's a campaigner's job to change things, not just to make a lot of noise. Whilst I have to make an enormous - almost cosmic - mindset shift to take this direction, Maximus also have to bring me into their trust and with very little to go on.

‘Someone is going to do it. I can do it, with all of my knowledge and personal experience of what is wrong with the system at the moment.’

One correspondent on Mrs Marsh’s website wrote: ‘I am so sorry to say this but I feel betrayed so much I can only now call you Judas.’

Another former supporter, Peter Farrington, said: ‘Sorry, I have to add my name to the list sickened by this decision. So sickened in fact I don't even want to try to explain why I find this a betrayal of the trust so many of us placed in you in recent years, Sue.’

Tony Cyphus branded Mrs Marsh a ‘sell-out, just like all the MPs who go on to work for the multinationals’.

‘So what happened to "I'm in so much pain I can't work, please give me DLA [Disability Living Allowance]”? I can't wait to see how much of a hypocrite you turn out to be. And be aware you have just marked yourself for a life of hate from people who really are true victims of this and future governments,’ he added.

Another activist wrote: ‘You've proudly displayed photos of yourself bed and hospital bound, yet it seems an offer of [reportedly] £75k per annum plus benefits has healed you. You've gone straight from the support group to full time employment - you truly are a modern day miracle. IDS's prayers have been answered.’

A spokesman for Maximus said: 'We believe, given her experience, that Sue will be able to contribute a great deal in making the customer experience of work capability assessments a better one.'
