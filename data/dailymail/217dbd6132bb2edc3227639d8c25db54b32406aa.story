There must have been times during the past nine months when Kyle Walker felt the lights had gone out on his career.

At the Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul, the lights did quite literally go out - but Walker was certainly back with a vengeance.

The right back suffered an abdominal injury way back in March. It curtailed his season with Tottenham and, worse still, precluded him from the World Cup with England, a tournament he almost certainly would have been picked for.

‘It was definitely my lowest point,’ Walker admitted this week as he recalled how he watched Roy Hodgson’s team flop out in Brazil from home, never knowing whether he could have improved things.

It didn’t help one bit that Walker had missed Euro 2012 with a broken toe. Was he cursed? It must have crossed his mind.

‘It has been a difficult long term injury to cope with, both mentally and physically. I had to dig deep,’ he added.

But here, on a miserable wet evening in Istanbul, in front of a half-empty arena which was plunged into darkness for a quarter-hour in the first-half, a fully-charged Walker made his return after that horribly long absence. And it didn’t look as though he’d missed a day.

In the post-Glen Johnson era, it looks like a fight between Walker and Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne to be England’s right back. Walker’s bid to impress Hodgson began here.

As his body recovered, Walker had ample time to dissect his game. Could tweaks be made? What could be done better?

He confessed in the build-up to his return that his positional play - in other words his defensive play - could be improved. That voice in his head that told him to get his head down and bomb forward at every opportunity needed to be hushed a little.

‘I think it will make me a better player,’ Walker said on the eve of this game.

So Walker has been deconstructed and reassembled. On this evidence, it’s to very promising effect. 

In many ways, this was the perfect match to be thrown back into. Since being declared match fit, Walker had only played 66 minutes of an Under 21 match with Manchester City at the Lamex Stadium in Stevenage.

So, from Hertfordshire to 'Hell' - or at least a pale imitation of it. With both sides already through, there was nothing riding on this one and it showed, with those assembled filling barely a third of the 76,000-capacity Olympic Stadium.

Walker could re-immerse himself with out the pressure of needing to win the match and he was straight into the thick of things.

Within seconds of the the start, Walker was making clearing headers and just three minutes in, he was off on his first charge forward, drawing a foul on the half-way line.

We were then plunged into darkness on eight minutes, the floodlights completely failing to leave only the sponsor boards and hundreds of mobile phone screens for illumination.

The players were off for 16 minutes in all, but it didn’t interrupt Walker’s power surges.

There one moment in particular when we knew the old player was back. Andros Townsend had the ball but, confronted by the Besiktas defence, had nowhere really to turn. Then, suddenly, like an express train, Walker had darted forward 30 yards to offer an overlap.

The resulting cross didn’t result in anything for Spurs but his willingness to support the attack was promising.

He was even more effective after the interval, getting into good positions and skinning his man on three or four occasions before swinging in a cross.

Walker was replaced on 76 minutes by Etienne Capoue, not as yet ready to play a full 90. But he’d done more than enough to suggest his best form won’t be too far away.
