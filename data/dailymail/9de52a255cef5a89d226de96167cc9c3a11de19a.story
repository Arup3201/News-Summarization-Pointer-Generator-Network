Two New Yorkers either don’t care about or don’t understand the city’s byzantine parking regulations.

Despite owing almost $350,000 for over 2,200 parking tickets between them, the two individuals aren’t even at the top of the list of worst scofflaws in New York. That honor goes to a New Jersey-based company that owes more than $316,000 for over 1,700 tickets, according to the city.

The 10 worst offenders were made public Monday by the New York Post.

Wallinton, NJ-based Consolidated Dairies owes a staggering $316,059 – including over $37,000 in interest – for 1,759 tickets racked up by drivers since 2005, according to the Post.

A message left for comment by MailOnline with the dairy products distributor was not returned.

The top 10 list, first reported by the Post, is made up almost entirely of companies - except for two people.

Manhattan resident John Caruso is indebted $176,821 for the 872 tickets he’s racked up in the past 8 years, including over $54,000 in interest, according to the Post, which speculated the reason he can’t be tracked down is because he’s never lived at the address listed for him in city records.

The Greenwich Street address the city has for him used to have mailboxes for non-residents, according to a doorman questioned by the Post.

Coming in just after Caruso is Brooklyn’s Anthony Grady, who owes $172,250 towards 1,404 tickets dating back to 2005. When the Post attempted to reach Grady, there was an eviction sign on the scofflaw’s door.

Former neighbors defended him, telling the Post that the parking signs in the area are confusing because of a nearby school.

‘The school has different schedules of when you can or can’t park on the road. The signs [are] a little bit hidden,’ Kelsea Baker told the paper.

City Finance Commissioner David Frankel expressed his frustration to the paper, saying that it’s ‘outrageous that a few New Yorkers cheat their fellow citizens.’

Frankel may be an outlier though, especially after the city’s rage-inducing parking signs were completely redesigned earlier this year.

Referring to the old parking signs as ‘a five-foot-high totem pole of confusing information,’ city Department of Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan said the new signs would be ‘ easier to read and take the stress out of figuring out where and when you can legally park’ at their January unveiling.

‘You shouldn't need a Ph.D in parking signage to understand where you are allowed to leave your car in New York," City Council Member Daniel Garodnick added.

Parking signs have long confused city drivers, and were even lampooned by comedian Louis C.K.

The city is still in the process of rolling out the new signs, but they – along with parking holidays in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy – may have contributed to the city issuing fewer tickets in fiscal year 2013 than in previous years.

Meter maids wrote just under 7.4million tickets totalling $466million between July 2012 and June 2013, according to the Post, a surprising drop from the 9million tickets and $512million in fines the previous year.

Deadbeat offenders owe about $570million in unpaid tickets, according to the Post. The city removes parking ticket debt from its books after eight years.
