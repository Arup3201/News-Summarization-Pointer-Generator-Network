Everton defender John Stones is confident he will never forget his maiden European away match.

Stones has experienced plenty of firsts in 2014 as his rapid rise to prominence continues, including starting a Barclays Premier League game early in the year and later going on to make his senior England debut.

The 20-year-old is now getting a taste of a continental campaign with his club in what is their return to European action after four seasons of not being involved.

The 20-year-old has had a stellar year, making his England debut on 30 May in a 3-0 win against Peru

Another milestone was Stones' first England start in a friendly against Norway on 3 September

And his latest new experience came on Thursday night as the Toffees played their first away fixture of Europa League Group H.

With the opponents being Russia's FK Krasnodar, the contest very much represented a journey into the unknown, even given the help Everton striker Samuel Eto'o and winger Aiden McGeady - both of whom have played in the country's premier division - tried to provide for their team-mates in the preparations.

It turned out to be an extremely tricky fixture for the Merseysiders from which they just salvaged a 1-1 draw, their stand-out seasoned European campaigner Eto'o notching an equaliser in the 82nd minute.

1 January 2014 - Stones makes his first Premier League start in a 1-1 draw against Stoke.

30 May 2014 - Two days after his 20th birthday, the defender makes his senior England debut in a 3-0 win over Peru.

3 September 2014 - Roy Hodgson names Stones in his starting line-up for his first England start in a friendly against Norway.

2 October 2014 - Another first for the Everton man as he features in his maiden European away game in a 1-1 draw against Krasnodar.

And reflecting upon the evening, Stones said: 'It is a big learning curve for me and one of these nights - you'll never forget the first one.

'It was hard - we don't get to see much of the Russian league, so we did our homework on them and got advice off Samuel and Aiden as much as we could.

'But you never really know until you get here and play them. It was pretty much a learning curve for us all.

'It is always hard when you are coming away to a such a hostile environment like here I suppose.

'It was very strange for us, something we are not used to.'

Everton were second-best for much of the game and fell behind in the 43rd minute when Ari capitalised on an error by Phil Jagielka and fired home.

Krasnodar created the bulk of the chances throughout and almost made it 2-0 in the second half when substitute Wanderson hit the bar.

Although there were a number of moments of uncertainty at the back for the visitors, Stones put in a fairly impressive individual display.

And he felt the team showed great character to snatch a 1-1 draw late on for a second successive match, having done the same in Saturday's Merseyside derby at Liverpool

It was a tricky affair, but Roberto Martinez's men held on to snatch a Europa League draw in Russia

Stones said: 'I think it is a very good point that we got out of the game.

'It was a bit sloppy for the first goal, but I thought the character we showed to come back and score the equaliser was credit to ourselves. 

'We dug in there and I thought we could even have had a few more. 

'It shows there is great character in the dressing room.'
