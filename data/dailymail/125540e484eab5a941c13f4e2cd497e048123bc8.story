A baby's first word is a precious moment in every parent's life, however you don't expect it to be the name of your local supermarket.

An adorable video records five-month-old Imogen Barnes saying her first word - and it's Asda.

The hilarious moment was captured on camera by her grandmother, Sandra.

Throughout the 44-second video, little Imogen is mainly gurgling indistinguishable noises as her grandmother gently rocks her and talks to her about their immenent trip to the supermarket.

Sandra is in the middle of talking when the infant 
suddenly and clearly wails 'Asda!'.

Imogen's mother, Rachel Holland, said: 'She was looking after Imogen and filmed loads of videos on her phone because Imogen had found her voice and was babbling away.

Imogen is the star of an adorable video where she says her first word.... Asda

'As soon as I came home Mum said "Oh my God you have got to look at this video!"

'I couldn't believe it when Imogen said "Asda". She said it twice. It was her first word and she hasn't said anything else since!'

Accounts Assistant, Rachel lives with her partner, Mark Barnes, in Valley Park, Southampton. The family regularly shop at nearby Asda Eastleigh.

She explains: 'I'm always at Asda! We do all our food shopping there and I love the George baby outfits too. They're really good quality.'

The video has divided people online with some calling it cute and others like @SamFullerPT commenting "Can you imagine this? Heartbreaking". Â
