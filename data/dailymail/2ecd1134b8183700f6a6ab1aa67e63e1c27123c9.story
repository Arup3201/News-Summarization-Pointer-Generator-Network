A Detroit father whose son had been missing for 11 days learned on live television that the boy had been found alive in his basement.

Charles Bothuell IV was on HLN to speak with Nancy Grace about the June 14 disappearance of his son Charlie, 12, when the host suddenly said she had new information.

'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said.

Bothuell was stunned - becoming visibly upset and clutching his chest as he struggled to speak.

It has since emerged that the father could face child abuse charges in the case. Police sources told WJBK that he allegedly beat his son with a PVC pipe and gave him a grueling exercise regime.

Stunned: Charlie Bothuell IV was shocked into silence on Wednesday when HLN's Nancy Grace told him his 12-year-old son had been found alive in his basement, 11 days after he vanished

Found: Charlie Bothuell V was found hiding in his father's basement after he'd been missing for 11 days

On the show, Grace repeated what she had said - this time importantly adding that he had been found 'alive'.

As the shocked father struggled to comprehend the news, Grace demanded to know whether or not he had checked his basement.

'I checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down there several times. We've all been checking.'

He said that authorities had even brought in dogs to check the basement of their Detroit townhouse but the boy had not been found.

Charlie Bothuell was discovered on Wednesday 
afternoon as authorities searched the home but it is not yet clear 
whether he had been there the whole week.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said 
when police found the boy, he appeared to be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did 
not announce himself.Â 

Overwhelmed: Bothuell clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found

Emotional: When Nancy Grace demanded to know if he'd checked the basement, he said repeatedly that he and his wife, as well as the FBI and the Detroit police had been down there

Craig said that he believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed the barrier himself. He was also behind a large plastic drum and bedding was found 
nearby.

'There's no way he could have erected this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' Craig told WJBK. 'He certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to actually talk and embrace Charlie.

'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.'

In
 the basement, a tunnel leads from apartment to apartment and to the 
outside, meaning he could have come and gone when he needed to, WJBK 
reported.

Sources told the news channel that the boy had claimed his stepmother, Monique, was helping him hide out and giving him food - but the family attorney has denied the claim.

His stepmother reportedly told police the boy didn't complete his daily exercise routine and when she told his father, Charlie ran away.

Sources also said that he often beat his son, who was homeschooled, with a PVC pipe and that blood was found in the boy's room - which is why police did not rule out homicide.

Police are investigating a serious case of child abuse we're told the father considered discipline.

WJBK reported that the father is expected to face child abuse charges in the next couple of days.

The boy was taken to hospital, where he was met by his biological mother. The extent of his injuries, if any, are unknown.

Relieved: The boy's father was so emotional when his son was discovered that he hugged a reporter

Charlie was last seen on June 14 when he took a break from working out and went to the bathroom - but never came back.

The boy lives in the home with his father and stepmother.

Just
 hours before he was found, Craig had told reporters that investigators 
were 'not ruling out the possibility of homicide' in the case.

After
 he emerged from the HLN interview, his father, Charlie Bothuell IV, 
said he was as surprised as anyone that his son was in the basement.

'I'm
 shocked. I looked. The Detroit police looked. The FBI looked,' he said.
 'To imply that I knew my son was in the basement is absurd.'

The elder Bothuell was swarmed by reporters outside the house when he arrived home Wednesday evening.

'I thought my son was dead,' he said as he broke down in tears and hugged a reporter.

Craig
 told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a 
polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother 
declined to do so.

Mr Bothuell's test came back inconclusive, WDIV reported.

He also told authorities that Charlie had ran away from home two years ago, but police found him after three hours.
