Celtic manager Ronny Deila admits he is reluctant to make too many changes for the midweek Europa League clash against Dinamo Zagreb after scraping a narrow 1-0 win at Motherwell.

The Hoops have already qualified for the last 32 of the competition, meaning Thursday's match in Croatia is effectively a dead rubber.

Deila has also expressed concerns about a hectic schedule having a detrimental effect on his players.

Celtic striker Anthony Stokes scored what turned out to be the winning goal for his side 

But, despite fears that fatigue could set in, the Celtic boss will resist the urge to make too many alterations from the side who secured their seventh league win in a row on Saturday.

He said: 'Some of them will get a chance but it's important also that we keep the consistency in the team as well.

'If we change too much, it's not good for the players who are playing.'

Deila will be seeking an improvement on the display at Fir Park, where an early Anthony Stokes goal was all that separated them from struggling Motherwell.

He added: 'I was a little bit angry because we had 20 very good minutes and then we started to be a little bit lazy and didn't work enough.

'Suddenly, Motherwell are a good team. We need to do the job for each other for 90 minutes.'

Deila was named SPFL Manager of the Month for November after guiding his side to four straight league wins 

However, Celtic's recent form overall has seen Deila rewarded with the SPFL Premiership manager of the month award for November.

He said: 'Of course it means a lot to me, that we have done well.

'Football is team work and my staff and I are working very close.

'I am a leader of the team and this is a reward for the whole team. We work very good together.

'We have worked really hard to get the results and this is a sign that we have done something right which is why I am very happy for everyone at Lennoxtown.

'I won manager of the year in Norway which I got last year when we won the league.'

Kenny Black is in the running to become the next manager of Motherwell on a permanent basis

Motherwell could name their new manager ahead of Saturday's clash with bottom side Ross County, with caretaker boss Kenny Black and former midfielder Rob Maaskant reported to be on the six-man shortlist to replace Stuart McCall.

Regardless of whether the new boss is in place or not, Black admits a win is crucial to start moving away from the Premiership danger zone.

He said: 'I think Ross County will bring their own game to the table. They showed a bit of spirit against Dundee United on Friday night.

'The four games I've had in charge were difficult games but, with the situation we're in just now, we'll have to battle and scrap for the remainder of the season like we did against Celtic.

'I think there's enough there with the players we have. We've got to do our talking on the park now and start getting some points and climbing the table.'
