Andy Vernon has hit back at Great Britain team-mate Mo Farah for labelling him 'an embarrassment' during their Twitter spat, insisting the double Olympic champion is 'very naive'.

The pair came to blows on the social networking site on Tuesday when Vernon questioned the quality of the field that Farah will come up against at this weekend Sainsbury’s Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham.

He tweeted: 'Another stellar field against Mo Farah on home turf this weekend at Birmingham.' #joke.’

The conversation quickly escalated as the two middle-distance runners aired their views on Twitter

Farah was from happy with Vernon's remarks, labelling the long-distance runner embarrassing while making a personal jibe at his expense - that singer Taylor Swift could probably run faster than he could.

'Shame you didn’t make the line up...again #ComeBackWhenYouWinSomethingDecent’, said Farah.

He added: 'That’s why they didn’t put you in the race mate.. Cos you’re an embarrassment!! Taylor swift can probably run faster than you!’

When speaking to the Portsmouth News Vernon gave his thoughts on the spat saying: 'He called me an embarrassment, but I find what he wrote is very naive.

‘Rather than me take offence to it – I feel it’s harsh on everyone else. 

‘If he thinks I am an embarrassment, then what does he think about the rest of us? It came across very arrogant from him.

‘Without blowing my own trumpet, I am, at the moment, the second best that the country has got.’

Vernon, who ended the argument by taking the higher ground, is currently recovering from a hamstring injury which he aggravated in the Great South Run in October.
