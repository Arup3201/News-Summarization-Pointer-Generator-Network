Thought your pet was a handful? Try a water-fighting dog, a tap-dancing parrot and a one-hamster 'shredding machine'.

The animals were just some of the 600 photographed by their owners for a contest to find Britain's most mischievous pets.

English springer spaniel Dexter, from Devon, took first prize after frolicking on his hind legs while being soaked with the hose by his owner Lucy Odell, now three.

Her father Matt said: 'It was a really hot day and they were having a lot of fun as Dexter absolutely loves water. We bought Dexter a couple of years ago and he is mischievous and hard work, but gets on really well with all the family. This was a lovely moment.'

Other images included a cat frolicking in a basin, a dog peeking through a cat flap and a lurcher puppy bringing its owner a flower to say sorry for digging up her garden.

The annual competition was run by the veterinary charity PetSavers. Chairman Pedro Martin Bartolome said: 'The quality of photographs submitted to the competition this year made for an enjoyable but difficult task for all those on the judging panel.'

Winner: Matt Odell from Devon took first prize in the contest for a photo of Dexter the springer spaniel having a water fight with his daughter Lucy. He said: 'It was a really hot day and they were having a lot of fun as Dexter absolutely loves water.' Judge Paul Walker said the image was a piece of 'timeless and brilliant comedy'

Ruff day? Emily Farrell, 15, from Northern Ireland, won the junior category with this photo of her pet dog Gypsey looking wide-eyed with surprise at a soaking

You drive me potty! Sean Goldie's photo was a runner-up in the contest, depicting his Jack Russell Alfie making off with the water-catching base for a garden plant

Rolling around: Eight-year-old whippet girl Willow was captured drying off on the beach after a swim in the sea in this runner-up image by her owner Alison Tew

I'm tired of baths! Donna Whitworth's four-month-old car Oreo yawns in a basin, left. Right, Suzie, the one-hamster shredding machine, practically lives in her owner Rosie Ray's waste paper basket where she shreds the contents, puts some of the paper in her pouches for her cage and then jumps out again

Forlorn: Alex Evans, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, took a runner-up prize with this photograph of his Labradoodle puppy Brynley - who has made a garden hideout in a bush. He said: 'He takes things in there he shouldn't including sticks, plants, water bottles and pots. We still love him to bits even if he is a bit devilish'

Puppy dog eyes: Hayley Marlow's runner-up photo showed her lurcher puppy Bourbon bringing her a flower to say sorry for destroying her garden. Right, Alexandria de Taranto's rose-crowned conure parrot, Chilli, 'tap dances' in the kitchen sink. Her owner said: 'She loves to run back and forth under the tap trying to catch the drips'

There's a good girl: Adam Higgins was a runner-up for this photograph of his Jack Russell Lily cooling off on a hot summer's day with an ice lolly treat from her owner

I don't want to go to school today: Kerry Jordan was a runner-up for this photograph of her dog hiding underneath a duvet

It won't fit! Katie Grisold's pet dog Harvey proved his mischievous qualities when he tried to sneak through a cat flap - but could not even get his head all the way in

Sarah Davies' runner-up photo, Billy at the Beach, showed her five-year-old cocker spaniel frolicking in the waves in incredible detail off the coast of Devon

A dog's life: Martyn Crookston captured this image of his pet Spencer in a Herefordshire stream. There were 600 entries to the competition which were praised by PetSavers chairman Pedro Martin Bartolome. He said: 'The quality of photographs submitted to the competition this year made for an enjoyable but difficult task'
