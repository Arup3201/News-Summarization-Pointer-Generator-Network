Metropolitan Police Chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the number of people arriving in Britain was causing a strain as newcomers 'find it difficult to integrate'

Mass migration to Britain has left police forces ‘struggling to cope’, the country’s top officer warned last night.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said that the large number of people arriving in Britain was causing a strain because they found it ‘difficult to integrate’.

The Scotland Yard chief told a law enforcement conference in New York: ‘What joins New York and London is that we’ve seen growth and with growth there is migration as an element of that.

‘All it means is that for the police to have community-based policing sometimes it can be more difficult to integrate with new populations.

‘People arrive with different languages, people arrive having different perceptions of police officers, so that in itself can be quite a challenge.

‘And in London we know that 25 per cent of the population growth of the United Kingdom arrived in London over the last ten years. We’ve all seen growth but not at the pace that we’ve seen it more recently.

‘So it’s just a simple logistical point that the more people arrive, the more quickly they arrive, all our bureaucracies struggle to cope with that, and the police are no different.

Sir Bernard has repeatedly highlighted the challenges faced by the criminal justice system in the face of foreign offenders. 

Earlier this year he said how more than half of all foreign criminals have a right to stay, which prevents them being deported.

He warned that the police and other agencies are not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration.

Police still struggle to obtain fast information on foreign suspects, such as Latvian convicted murdered Arnis Zalkalns - the prime suspect in the Alice Gross murder who has since killed himself

A third of crimes in the capital are committed by foreign offenders but the majority are EU citizens who may have the freedom to live and travel between member states. 

There have been repeated calls for the police to do more to stop those banned from Britain getting in and to kick out those who should no longer be here.

Police still struggle to obtain fast and accurate information on foreign suspects, which was highlighted in the recent murder of teenager Alice Gross.

Officers discovered Latvian prime suspect Arnis Zalkans, who later killed himself, was a convicted murderer who had repeatedly travelled to the UK.
