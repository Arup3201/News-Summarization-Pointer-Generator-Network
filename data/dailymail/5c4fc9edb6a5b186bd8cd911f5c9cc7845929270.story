A family-run, dry-cleaning business has come under fire for putting pro-life messages on wire coat hangers.

Springdale Cleaners, which has ten branches in Ohio, has for five years returned clean clothes to customers with a paper hanger cover which reads: 'Choose Life' and has a picture of the owner's baby granddaughter.

The business is owned by Paul Dehler, 66, and his wife Diane who have run the firm since 1969.

His son Paul Dehler Jr told MailOnline today that his father had introduced the coat hangers because his sister is a member of a pro-life group and they asked about advertising. 

Mr Dehler Jr, whose daughter features on the hanger, said: 'If anything it has helped the business. We have had letters saying people switched their business to us because of the hangers.'

He added that he did not believe that the hangers were offensive or insensitive and that they had a right to their say.

The coat hanger is long associated with the self-induced abortion, performed without medical staff and often by dangerous means.

The practice is for the most part illegal even when abortion is legal, due the the extreme risk of death.

Women have been known to attempt to remove the fetus with a coat hanger by inserting it into the uterus through the cervix. Resulting puncture wounds can lead to septicemia.

A 1968 study found around 1.2 million illegal abortions took place each year in the U.S.

The landmark supreme court decision of Roe v Wade made abortion widely available in the U.S.  It was decided that a woman's right to abortion must be balanced with protecting prenatal life and protecting women's health.

Mr Dehler Jr said that although the hanger cover is being redesigned the 'Choose Life' statement would remain.

The coat hanger has long been a symbol of 'back-alley' abortions.

Pro-choice supporters have used hangers in their campaigns 
to highlight the danger of banning abortion and show what desperate measures have been taken in the past.

One blogger
 called it the 'worst marketing decision ever' while on a Facebook 
pro-choice page, one user Lilithe Magdalene said she wrote to the 
cleaners about the hangers being 'beyond twisted'.

Springdale Cleaners is a family business which prides itself in 'exceptional customer service', according to its website.

The leader of the Ohio Senate put a 
stop last month to a bill that would have imposed the most stringent 
restriction on abortions in the nation.

The
 so-called ‘heartbeat’ bill would have banned abortion once a heartbeat 
is detected in the fetus with no exceptions for rape, incest or the 
health of the mother.
