Next-generation gaming may be around the corner, but it's no secret that Sony plan to prolong the Playstation 3's lifespan for as long as possible.

And what better way to do it by calling in the latest installment of heavy-hitting beat-em-up, Soulcalibur.

Lost Swords will be a PS3 exclusive and free-to-play, in the vein of Tekken Revolution. It works using a 'time-limited' model, meaning that once the initial demo hours have been completed, players must purchase tokens to continue playing the game.

Graphically, although obviously not up there with the likes of Killer Instinct, it's looking strong, too.
