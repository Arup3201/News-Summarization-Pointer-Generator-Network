Weather forecaster Michael Fish this morning became a victim of St Jude's Storm when a birch tree fell in his garden thanks to high winds.

The veteran broadcaster is best remembered for telling BBC viewers in 1987 that there was not a 'hurricane' on the way, hours before Britain was hit by the most destructive storm for 300 years.

Yesterday he joked that many people would believe the damage to his garden 'serves him right' for his incorrect prediction 26 years ago.

Mishap: Michael Fish in his garden, where a tree was blown over by St Jude's Storm

Destruction: Mr Fish claimed that his wife blamed his weather forecasting for the mishap

Mr Fish, 69, added that
 new computer models had allowed the Met Office to warn the public about
 the storm in good time, preventing 'horrendous loss of life'.

He
 told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I had a phone call from my wife 
not so long ago, and of course it was my fault that a tree has 
apparently gone down in my garden and over the neighbour's garage.

'So even I don't escape - and I can hear some of you saying, "Serves him right!"'

Asked if predictions of the storm's severity had proven to be exaggerated, he replied: 'No, no. It's been a terrific storm.

Joke: The veteran broadcaster quipped that the mishap 'serves him right' for his notorious error

Victim: Michael Fish, pictured during a broadcast in October 1987 shortly before the Great Storm, had a tree fall in his garden this morning

'There has been massive damage and if we hadn't been banging the drum for about a week or so there could have been some horrendous loss of life as well.

'I am hoping and praying that we have virtually avoided all that.'

Praising the accuracy of modern 
computer modelling, he said: 'It couldn't be done in my day. We were 
only able to do forecasts for one or two days ahead.'

Shortly
 before the Great Storm of October 16, 1987, Mr Fish told viewers: 
'Earlier on today apparently a lady rang the BBC and said she heard that
 there was a hurricane on the way.

Then: An uprooted tree lies across a car in London after the Great Storm on October 15, 1987

Now: A car in North London which was crushed by a falling tree this morning

'Well, don't worry if you're watching, there isn't.'

The iconic moment has achieved such notoriety that it even featured in the opening ceremony of last year's Olympic Games.

Mr Fish has always insisted that he was not in fact talking about Britain - but this time around, he was taking no chances.

The forecaster, who now broadcasts on a weather website after leaving the BBC, advised commuters to take the morning off work due to the difficulty of travelling.
