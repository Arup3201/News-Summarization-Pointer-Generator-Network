All eyes will be on President Obama at noon tomorrow when he makes his public inauguration address but come the evening the world's attention will inevitably turn to the First Lady and the gown she has chosen to wear to the couple's second inauguration ball.

Though Michelle Obama certainly has the knack for getting it right in the fashion stakes, she may want to cast her eye over some of the inauguration dresses chosen by First Ladies gone by.

The Smithsonian Museum of American History in Washington D.C. has a collection of the First Ladies choices going back 100 years, from Helen Taft to the present day. 

Donation: Helen Herron Taft, pictured right at her husband's 1909 
inauguration was the first First Lady to donate her gown to the 
Smithsonian Museum of American History.

Elegant: Eleanor Roosevelt chose this simple floor length number for the 1933 inauguration ball

Rhinestones: Mamie Eisenhower wore a pink full-skirted dress to her husband's inauguration in 1953. The dress was covered in hundreds of rhinestones

The dresses show how different styles appealed in different eras.

Grace
Coolidge wore a rare short dress to the occasion while Hillary 
Clinton's violet, jewel-encrusted dress worn to the 1993 inauguration is
one of the most elaborate and traditional ball-gowns on show.

The
tradition of donating an inauguration gown to the museum began with 
First Lady Helen Taft who donated her white silk chiffon dress by the 
Frances Smith Company from her husband's 1909 inauguration.

Since then every First Lady since has donated their dress from the occasion.

In March 2010, Michelle Obama donated the one-shouldered white Jason Wu dress she wore to her husband's 2009 inauguration. 

At
the time she said: 'When we look at the dress that Jackie Kennedy wore 
50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore 100 years before 
that, it takes us beyond the history books and the photographs and helps
us understand that history is made by talented people. The dress I 
donated today, made by Jason Wu, is a masterpiece. It’s simple, it’s 
elegant and it comes from the brilliant mind of someone who is living 
the American Dream.'

Own designs: Jackie Kennedy did her own sketches
for her 1961 inauguration dress. Ethel Frankau of Bergkorf Custom 
Design made the white dress which had a strapless bodice and chiffon 
overlay. It was worn with a matching cape, picture right

Keeping it simple: Claudia "Lady Bird"  Johnson made a departure from elaborate, detailed designs with a simple yellow dress and matching jacket by John Moore worn to the 1965 inauguration ball

Bolero: Pat Nixon opted for a short jacket and 
canary yellow dress combination. It was designed for the 1969 
inauguration ball by Karen Stark for Harvey Berin

Recycled: Rosalynn Carter caused some outrage by wearing this long-sleeved dress to the 1977 inauguration because  the First Lady had been seen wearing it previously. It was clearly a firm favorite and did her husband no harm by suggesting she was un-extravagant

The dress catapulted the designer to international fame and earned Michelle Obama full-marks from the fashion pack.

Industry
publications have been desperate to correctly guess what the 
fashion-forward First Lady will pick this time around  - and to see 
which lucky designer she has bestowed with the honor.

High Street pieces worn by the First Lady over the past four years, 
from the likes of Gap and J Crew, have flown off the shelves and more 
exclusive designers have also seen a surge in interest if she is 
photographed in their wares.

American designer Naeem Kahn is one name that has been put forward this time around.

Asymmetrical: Nancy Reagan wore an inauguration gown similar to the one Michelle Obama wore in 2009. The one-shouldered white embellished dress was designed by James Galanos. 'She knew her style very well, and it was always simple and elegant,' Galanos told the Los Angeles Times

Possible clash: Arnold Scaasi designed this gown for Barbara Bush. The designer had already sold three so he called his other clients to ensure they weren't wearing it to the 1989 ball

Purple reign: Hillary Clinton, often criticized by the fashion pack, took on an uncharacteristic glitzy style with this gown for the 1993 inauguration ball

First Lady in red: Laura Bush opted for this eye-catching Michael Faircloth gown for her husbands 2001 inauguration ball

The First Lady wore one of his dresses to a State Dinner in honor of Germany's Angela Merkel at the White House last year and she also wore one of his designs back in 2009.

Whoever she chooses, the fashion world say we may be in for something unusual this time around.

In the past, second inauguration dresses tend to defy expectations as First Ladies become more comfortable in their own skin and in the limelight. 

Getting it right: Michelle Obama chose a Jason Wu dress for the inauguration ball in 2009, left. The First Lady started the inauguration festivities in style yesterday opting for a simple and chic white shirt and black trousers. The fashion world has been speculating for weeks over who will design her gown for the balls tomorrow night

Well-received: Michelle Obama's Jason Wu gown from the 2009 inauguration was a hit among the fashion critics. There has been plenty of speculation about who she will wear tomorrow

'If you look back at many First Ladies’ second inaugural gowns they make more of a statement about the individual rather than the position and the moment,' Kate Betts, former editor of Harper’s Bazaar, told New York Magazine this week.

So far Mrs Obama seems to have got her inauguration weekend fashion choices spot on.

Looking chic with a new haircut for her husband's new term, she wore a simple white shirt and black trousers to a military family gala last night, offset by a bright and bejeweled belt.
