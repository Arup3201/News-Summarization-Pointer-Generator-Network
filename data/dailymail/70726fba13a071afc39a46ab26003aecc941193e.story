Sharp-eyed mobile internet users have spotted what could be a new logo for Google.

While the internet giant has not suggested it is searching for a new look, hints of a slicker logo have appeared in the latest version of its mobile internet browser.

If the 'new' logo spotted is indeed Google's latest look, the shadows and beveling has been removed from the primary coloured lettering.

Is this Google's new branding? The logo is hidden away in the latest beta release of Chrome for Android, which is largely used by app developers and is probably not meant to be seen yet

As well as the flat appearance of the letters, they are more muted in colour and the overall appearance of the logo looks more modern.

The logo is hidden away in the latest beta release of Chrome for Android, which is largely used by app developers and is probably not meant to be seen yet, ars technica reported.

The cleaner logo was being used for a new tab page but it was quickly pulled - presumably by someone who might have feared the cat had been let out of the bag.

Google's current logo is brighter and is composed of beveled letters with shading, unlike the 'new' one

However, Joshua Stewart spotted it can also be seen on Google's servers by changing the number in the URL of Google's current logo to: https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo5w.png.

The tech community has therefore deduced that the flat design of the logo has been produced by Google but there is no confirmation about whether it will be rolled out.

One person said to be familiar with the change in branding told The Verge that the flat logo will not replace the current branding in the near future

If the logo is introduced across Google's product range, it will be the first redesign of its logo since 2010 when it tweaked the colours to make it brighter and reduced the amount of shading in the letters.

Yahoo! recently unveiled a new logo to generally negative reviews after teasing the new design with a month of logos.

Yahoo's CEO Marissa Mayer wrote in a blog about the lengthy process of the re-design.

She said: 'We hadn’t updated our logo in 18 years...We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated. Modern and fresh, with a nod to our history.  Having a human touch, personal.  Proud.'
