Manchester United's new £750million kit deal has re-established them as the world’s most valuable sports team at a stroke, it was revealed on Tuesday, and now Louis van Gaal must engineer an equally dramatic transformation on the pitch.

The 62-year-old Dutchman will make his long-awaited arrival at United’s Carrington training complex this morning ready to meet his new staff and set about reviving the fallen giants of English football.

Van Gaal will address the players before overseeing the second of two training sessions.

Welcome back: United have announced a £750million ten-year-deal with Adidas starting in 2015

Manchester United - *Adidas - £75million

(*Begins at the start of the 2015-16 season)

Arsenal - Puma - £30million

Real Madrid - Adidas - £24million

Liverpool - Warrior - £23million

Barcelona - Nike - £22million

Bayern Munich - Adidas - £22million

Manchester United - **Nike - £21.6million

(**Ends after the 2014/15 season)

It will be his only contact with the 
squad before they leave for a pre-season tour of America on Friday 
because the players have been given Thursday off.

Van
 Gaal knows time is precious, with United opening their Premier League 
campaign at home to Swansea in exactly one month’s time.

The 2012-13 
title-holders slumped to a dismal seventh place under David Moyes last 
season and considerable progress must be made to establish them as 
contenders again.

At least 
Van Gaal takes over a club in a much healthier financial state following
 the announcement that adidas will replace Nike as United’s kit supplier
 from next season in a deal worth at least £75m a year over the next 
decade.

Pushed down: United's deal with Adidas moves them above Real as the world's most valuable club

Manchester United - Chevrolet - £53million

Barcelona - Qatar Airways - £26million

Bayern Munich - Deutsche Telekom - £23million

Real Madrid - Emirates - £23million

Liverpool - Standard Chartered - £18million

Sunderland - Invest in Africa - £18million

Shares rose almost 
five per cent on the New York Stock Exchange as a result yesterday, with
 United now valued at £2.1billion — restoring them to the top of the 
rich list above Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona.

However,
 there is also a feeling of uncertainty around the club ahead of Van 
Gaal’s arrival, with a number of players fearing for their futures and 
even coaching staff unsure of their roles in the new set-up.

Phil
 Neville, who returned to the club as first-team coach under Moyes, is 
understood to be still in the dark over his position, three months after
 the Scot was sacked.
