David Lancos, pictured, convinced a woman he was dying of cancer and conned her out of $15,000

A gambling addict convinced a woman he was dying from cancer for two years in order to con her out of $15,000 to pay for his habit, police say.

David Lancos, 59, from Pennsylvania, met Judith Brown, also 59, while watching harness racing - a type of horse racing - at a casino and racetrack in Butler County.

The pair began talking when Lancos told Ms Brown he was suffering from cancer and couldn't afford his treatment, it has been claimed.

Ms Brown took pity on Lancos and in December 2012 agreed to start paying him $300 per month, payments which continued until March 2014, according to police.

The charges against Lancos also state that he asked Ms Brown to pay an undisclosed amount for two trips that he claimed were to a cancer centre in Philadelphia.

He also allegedly demanded $9,000 is order to pay lawyers, saying he was left unable to work and had to liquidate his share of the family business.

Investigators say Ms Brown borrowed the $9,000 from a bank after Lancos promised to pay her back, but never received the money.

Shortly afterwards she discovered that Lancos didn't have cancer and contact police, but by that point was already $14,790 out of pocket.

When officers went to arrest Lancos they discovered he was already in jail on unrelated charges.

Police questioned him about the money, but he told them that none of it was left because he had already frittered it away gambling, investigators say.

Lancos has been charged with theft by deception and in being held in jail on a $10,000 bail. 

When he was arrested, Lancos, 59, told detectives he no longer had any of the cash as he had gambled it
