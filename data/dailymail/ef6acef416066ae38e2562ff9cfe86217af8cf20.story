These dramatic pictures show terrified passengers being evacuated from a plane that was about to leave Glasgow Airport but suddenly became filled with smoke.

At least 20 were injured in the incident this morning, where the pilot of a Jet2 aircraft bound for Alicante in Spain was forced to abort its take-off.

Four people were taken to hospital and another 13 people received treatment at the scene for minor injuries, after the evacuation at 7.40am.

In a shaky video filmed by one of the 189 passengers, several people are shown sliding down the plane's inflatable exit chutes.

Scary: Passengers, including a woman in green, were forced to slide down the Jet2 plane's emergency chute but some may have been injured in the process, bottom right 

The video hears the plane's alarms ringing out and some screaming while the person filming says simply 'this is crazy' and tells people sliding down to be careful.

Many of the people injured were hurt as they left the plane, and some may have clattered into eachother when going down the chutes, Jet2 has admitted.

Passenger Stephen McFadden said 'people started running' as the 737's pilot shouted 'get out get out after carrying out an emergency stop.

'We were careering up the runway and smoke started belting out of all the air vents with a smouldering smell,' he said.

'Then the brakes went on and the emergency chutes went out and we were all evacuated.

Evacuation: This Jet2 plane, stranded on the Tarmac at Glasgow Airport, was about to take-off when smoke was detected in its cabin, forcing a mass evacuation

'I have a nine-week-old daughter and a four-year-old daughter. I had my nine-week-old attached to my chest as I went down the emergency chute and my wife had our four-year-old and was in tears.

'It was like something out of a movie. There was panic, people started running and I shouted 'slow down', and then the pilot shouted "get out, get out".

"It was just sheer panic, something no-one would want to go through again."

Fellow passenger Graham Divers, 40, a businessman from Glasgow, said: 'We were going full throttle down the tarmac when me and the chap sitting next to me saw smoke swirling above our heads.

'He said he thought he saw it coming from the right engine.

'I didn't know what to do, so I was about to shout to the cabin crew when the pilot obviously sussed it.

'He slammed the brakes on really hard and put the engines into reverse.

'There was a stunned silence when we stopped, everyone was in shock.

'The captain called the cabin crew into the cockpit and a few minutes later yelled 'evacuate, evacuate'.

'The crew were brilliant. They ushered us onto the wing. I was a little worried because I could smell aviation fuel.

'The captain should be praised because I looked back and he was running up and down the cabin to make sure everyone else was off before him. And then afterwards he came round to us all to make sure we were all right.

'I saw at least a dozen people being treated by paramedics with breathing masks and a woman twisted her ankle and I saw a couple of pensioners being taken away in an ambulance.

'I am a frequent flier and I have never experienced anything like it.

A passenger plane has made a safe emergency landing at Dublin Airport today after crew detected smoke in the cockpit.

The Thomas Cook flight touched down at about 9.40am, a spokeswoman for the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) said.

The plane was en route from Manchester to Tenerife.

'The aircraft was en route from Manchester. There was a report of smoke in the cockpit,' the spokeswoman said.

All 323 passengers have been evacuated from the plane.

The DAA's full emergency response was put into action and backed up by at least a dozen fire and ambulance crews from across Dublin as a precaution.

'I think we were all in shock when it
was all happening. It was only afterwards that people began to shake 
and realise exactly what had happened.'

Alan Masterton, who was with his wife Sandra, said: 'The flight safety drill had been done and we were off on the runway 
when almost straight away the cabin started to fill up with smoke.

'I think it’s everybody’s worst nightmare on a plane. It was absolutely terrifying.'

A spokeswoman for the Scottish 
Ambulance Service said: 'We removed four casualties who were taken to 
the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.'

At least 12 flights were unable to take off from Glasgow and a number of others have been diverted to Edinburgh.

Managing director of Jet2 Ian Doubtfire travelled to Glasgow from the company's Leeds base to talk to staff and deal with the incident.

He said: 'During the very early part of the take-off, smoke was seen in the aircraft and the cabin crew informed the captain and he stopped the take-off.

'I've talked to the crew extensively about what happened and they said that the exit from the aeroplane was textbook.

'Obviously, they do a lot of training for this and they said that it was done in the required time, as you have to evacuate quickly with smoke on board.'

Mr Doubtfire said injuries when evacuating an aircraft via chutes are common.

'It is possible to get injured when evacuating quite fast,' he said.

'People often stop at the bottom and 
others may come and slide into them or whatever, but all the chutes 
operated normally and the evacuation was textbook.'

He added that the passengers onboard the flight will still be able to travel to Spain today.

'We have asked the passengers if they
wish to travel to Alicante and most of them want to do so, so we are 
arranging an aircraft to come and collect them this afternoon and leave 
around 3pm.'

Disruption: Flights were cancelled, delayed or diverted because of the incident

A
Strathclyde Police spokeswoman said this morning: 'We are currently dealing with an 
ongoing incident at Glasgow Airport involving a 737 aircraft following 
reports of smoke within the cabin.

'Emergency services are in attendance and the passengers have been evacuated as a precaution.

'One elderly woman sustained a minor injury leaving the plane.

'Inquiries are ongoing.'

A statement from Jet2 said: 'This morning's flight LS177 from Glasgow Airport to Alicante made an emergency stop on the runway just prior to take-off.

'The aircraft was forced to curtail take-off due to smoke in the cabin.

'All 189 passengers have disembarked the aircraft.'

Airport bosses said they had to close the runway.

A spokesman from Glasgow Airport said: 'Flight LS177 from
Glasgow Airport to Alicante was forced to make an emergency stop on the runway
just prior to take off.  The 737-800 Jet2.com aircraft was forced to
curtail take off due to smoke in the cabin.

'All 189 passengers were
disembarked. Glasgow Airport had to suspend flights until 10am when the runway
was reopened. This has resulted in delays and passengers are advised to check
with their airlines.'
