A desperate WWII veteran killed himself with a shotgun because he feared he would have to go into a care home and loose his independence, an inquest heard.

George Duckmanton, 88, whose eyesight was failing, was terrified by his deteriorating health and did not want to lose his freedom.

Mr Duckmanton, a retired sergeant who served with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, was ‘fiercely independent’ and desperately did not want to move out of his own home despite the fact he was going blind.

George Duckmanton, left age 22, in India during the Second World War, and right age 65 with his late wife Jean at home in Heighington, Lincoln.  He shot himself because he 'didn't want to go into a home'

Lincoln Coroner’s Court heard Mr Duckmanton climbed through a fence onto a railway embankment behind his home and shot himself.

The court heard the shotgun was an heirloom given to him by his father.

Nephew David Easton, 73, said today that George ‘hated institutions’ and was trying to cling on to his independence.

Grandfather-of-four Mr Easton, from Osbournby, Linconshire, said: ‘He was not on his own. He had a lovely community around him - some of his neighbours had lived next door to him for 40 years.

‘He was independent and enjoyed the company of his neighbours and going to church.

‘His road was like a caricature of what England used to be like. It had a real sense of community - he was extremely fortunate.

‘I think he worried what it would be like if he was taken out of the community. He hated institutions. It would have killed him being in a place like that - he was a proud man.

‘He felt the cold and he was worried about having enough income to heat his house.

‘His sight was slowly deteriorating, but he was fearful that he would go blind and then would not be able to look after himself.

‘He was fiercely independent and he was a proud man. I am too - it must be in the genes. Like many of us he wanted to be in control of his own life.

‘We were not planning to put him in a home in near future, it must have just been his anxieties. That was his problem, he worried about things that might not even happen.

‘He was probably a depressive personality and he took medication for anxiety.

‘I have four grandchildren so I have a reason to get up in the morning - he didn’t have any children and was a widower.’

Tragic Mr Duckmanton, who had no children, had lived alone in Heighington, Linconshire, after his wife died in 1999.

Lincoln Coroner’s Court heard at around 10.15am on March 16 Mr Duckmanton climbed through a fence onto a railway embankment behind his home.

He then shot himself with the firearm, which had been given to him by his father.

The inquest was told a neighbour heard a loud bang and saw Mr Duckmanton ‘fly in the air’.

Coroner Stuart Fisher recorded a verdict of suicide.

George served as a sergeant with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers in India during WW2.

Verdict: suicide.
