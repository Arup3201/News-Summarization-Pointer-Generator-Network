The edges are scuffed and some of the scarlet leather is peeling. But the lock and key still work beautifully, the inside is immaculate and you cannot fail to feel the hand of history the moment you grab the handle.

For there, inscribed in gold on the front, is the name: ‘The Rt Hon Winston S Churchill, MP’.

And next week, it could be yours.

Balancing act: Winston Churchill amuses his daughter Mary in 1943. Mary died last year aged 91

How on earth do you value the Despatch Box of a man who is regularly voted the greatest politician/Briton/leader of all time? How, for that matter, do you value his paintings — or the tiny silver spoons which his pet budgerigars used to play with on the dining room table?

These questions will be answered next week when the greatest single collection of Churchillian memorabilia comes under the hammer in a historic sale expected to pull in everyone from international art dealers to the car-boot sale crowd.

This delightful hotch-potch of treasures — what curators call ‘Churchilliana’ — contains some lots priced as low as £15 and others heading for £1 million. 

Because quite apart from being the man who led Britain through her darkest hour and on to victory, Churchill was also a genuinely accomplished artist.

The sale follows the death, earlier this year, of his youngest child, Mary Soames, at 91. Commander of a wartime ack-ack battery, she went on to become her father’s aide-de-camp and the diligent custodian of his memory for the best part of half a century.

She was also a distinguished public figure in her own right, as an author, chairman of the National Theatre and chatelaine of Government House in Rhodesia (where her late husband, Lord Soames, was the last governor).

Only three non-royal women in history have been admitted to the Order of the Garter and Lady Soames was one of them.

With the sale of her West London home, her worldly goods are now being dispersed. Some items, including 38 of her father’s paintings, have been left to the nation for display at Chartwell, the family home now maintained by the National Trust.

Other pieces have been distributed among Lady Soames’s five children and their families. But the remainder — ranging from a £15 stainless steel bell and a perfectly ordinary £200 sofa to some of Churchill’s finest canvases — will be sold at Sotheby’s on Wednesday in this grandest of house clearances.

Given the eclectic nature of the sale, the auctioneers are calling it, simply, Daughter Of History.

The art world will be watching works like Winston’s The Goldfish Pool At Chartwell, a Churchillian homage to the French Impressionists and widely regarded as one of his greatest paintings for its rich tones, depth and bold, sensuous brush-strokes. Churchill certainly thought so himself, picking it out for a special mention in his 1948 book, Painting As A Pastime.

‘He adored Chartwell — and he was the only one allowed to feed the goldfish. Anything from Chartwell is extremely personal,’ explains Sotheby’s Head of Modern Art, Frances Christie, who has put an estimate of £400,000 to £600,000 on the work, though it could go for considerably more. In 2007, Sotheby’s sold another Chartwell scene to a private collector for £1 million.

Among the 15 oil paintings in this sale, there is one of Chartwell’s walled garden, which Churchill built himself, some of Blenheim Palace, his grandfather’s ancestral seat, and a dazzling vision of the harbour at Cannes. Put together, the whole 256-lot show is conservatively valued at around £5 million.

But my gaze instantly lands on that battered Despatch Box. It’s neither the one he had as Chancellor nor as Prime Minister, but those are both national treasures on permanent public display. This one, engraved with his earlier Cabinet title, ‘Secretary of State For The Colonies’, is the only one the rest of us might ever own. I imagine it will exceed its catalogue estimate — £5,000-£7,000.

There will surely be a few politicians chasing this thing. Just last year, MPs were ordered to desist from the superstitious habit of touching ‘Churchill’s foot’ before a major speech as Sir Winston’s statue in the Members’ Lobby was starting to deteriorate.

You certainly wouldn’t need to bother rubbing his shoes if you had his Despatch Box. Just stick a copy of your speech in there to cook for a few minutes and — hey presto! — out pops an oratorical masterpiece.

Another box with a history is the 1930 yew and ivory-mounted cigar humidor from Asprey (estimated price: £1,500). Lady Soames, it turns out, not only inherited her father’s love of cigars, puffing away long into old age, but also competed with him.

‘I have vivid memories of my mother and Grandpapa seeing who could get the longest tail on the end of their cigar before it fell off,’ recalls Emma Soames, Churchill’s granddaughter.

Emma also recalls the ever-expanding menagerie at Chartwell.

‘Once something arrived, it stayed,’ she laughs. A particular favourite was a budgerigar called Toby who would be brought out of his cage after lunch and encouraged to walk up and down the table and grab the spoons out of the salt cellars with his beak.

‘I was three when I first saw this and was absolutely riveted. Grandpapa was much amused by it all.’

In 1960, the grandchildren even produced a montage purporting to be a birthday card from this multi-talented bird. ‘From Toby Churchill To Winston, November 30, 1960’ it says beneath some pretty bird scenes. Ostensibly valued at £40, it will surely go for substantially more.

Churchill was even more fond of his cats. To this day, in accordance with his wishes, there is a marmalade cat called Jock on the Chartwell payroll. Named after Churchill’s private secretary, Jock Colville, the current incumbent is Jock VI. But this sale offers touching reminders of Jock’s predecessor — Tango.

Churchill was besotted with Tango — or ‘Mr Cat’ as he called him. In her book, A Daughter’s Tale, Mary Soames noted: ‘He became the apple of my father’s eye. He had the cream from a saucer (sitting on a chair or on the table).’

When ‘Mr Cat’ was run over by a car in 1942, in the same week as the fall of Tobruk, the PM’s staff were instructed not to tell him until there was better news from the battlefront to soften the blow.

A regular visitor to Chartwell was the distinguished artist, Sir William Nicholson, who first turned up in 1933 to paint a portrait of Winston and his wife, Clementine, and became a family friend. He would also enjoy sketching ‘Mr Cat’ and then sent the family the results.

Several such portraits of Tango are in the sale, accompanied by inscriptions such as: ‘My love to your cat, please. WN.’

Apart from being a prolific painter, Churchill must have been the subject of more paintings than any other 20th century politician. Of all of them, Mary Soames’s favourite was Sir Oswald Birley’s 1950 portrait of Winston in one his trademark ‘siren’ boiler suits. Bids will start at the £100,000 mark.

There are plenty of books here, too. Churchill’s literary prowess rubbed off on Mary who would write several tomes herself, including an award-winning biography of her mother. The sale includes a bound volume of Churchill’s early wartime speeches signed: ‘Mary, from Papa March 1941.’ It is expected to fetch upwards of £3,500.

Given the eclectic nature of the sale, the auctioneers are calling it, simply, Daughter Of History.

For those on a tighter budget, there is a first edition of the 48-page Eagle comic strip — bound in red leather — called The Happy Warrior: The Life Of Sir Winston Churchill (starting price: £500). And in among it all is a delightful reminder that even the greatest leaders can leave the most important issues to the last minute. It would seem that on Clementine’s 70th birthday, in 1955, Churchill failed to get a card.

Instead, we find a piece of Downing Street stationery hastily inscribed: ‘With many happy returns from W.’ Underneath it, however, is a little drawing of a pig, Clementine’s nickname for her husband.

It must have gone down well for, rather than ending up in the bin, it ended up in a frame, along with the envelope. Bids will start at £2,000.

This no ordinary auction. Tomorrow, Sotheby’s will assemble historians, members of the family and Churchillian actor Edward Fox, plus his own daughter, actress Emilia Fox, for a day of readings and reminiscences about the special bond between Winston and his doting daughter.

As Britain prepares to mark next month’s 50th anniversary of Churchill’s state funeral, it is a reminder that the spell which the old boy managed to cast over his country remains as strong as ever.
