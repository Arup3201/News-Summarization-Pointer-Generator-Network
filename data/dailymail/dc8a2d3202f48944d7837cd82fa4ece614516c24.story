The colour of their shirts was symbolic and befitted the sombre occasion, matador red being replaced by funeral black.

Spain may have rounded off a demoralising few weeks with a comfortable 3-0 victory over Australia in Curitiba but there was little appetite for fiesta, no sense that they had achieved some kind of consolation. This, after all, was the end of an era.

From the line-up that had no place for those luminaries Xavi or Iker Casillas to the solemn trudge David Villa made to the touchline and the blank expression on Vicente del Bosque’s face at the final whistle, it felt like the time had come to say goodbye to those who have so entertained.

Man of the match: Andres Iniesta.

For Villa, 
who set the ball rolling with a cute 36th minute back-heel, 
international retirement looms, as it does for Xabi Alonso. Xavi and 
Casillas may well follow, while Del Bosque has offered to fall on his 
sword after overseeing such a dismal defence of the trophy they won in 
2010.

Changes, 
clearly, are afoot yet if the last two weeks have been a catastrophe for
 Spain, there can be no disputing that much of the previous six years 
have been breathtakingly glorious, a period in which our views on how 
football should be played were redefined.

It is why 
Spain’s exit from this carnival should be lamented. Holland and Chile, 
clearly, deserved to progress at their expense from Group B but you 
cannot help but feel the tournament will lack something when magicians 
like Andres Iniesta are no longer involved.

Iniesta, 
as has so often been the case, was the star of the show, his repertoire 
of passing too much for a limited Australia side to handle. This was his
 100th appearance for Spain and, typically, he used the ball with 
metronomic precision; long or short, quick or slow, he always picked the
 right option.

Del Bosque
 made seven changes to the team that was humbled by Chile in Rio de 
Janeiro last Wednesday but Iniesta’s place was sacrosanct and his 
presence helped Spain negotiate a tricky opening period to get on top in
 the 23rd minute.

He ushered
 in Juanfran with a ball that was both immaculately timed and 
beautifully weighted, taking advantage of the time and space Australia 
had given him; Juanfran, who had surged into Australia’s penalty area, 
picked out Villa, who nonchalantly did the rest.

This was 
what we have come to expect from Spain: the change of pace, the runs 
that pull defences apart, the artistic passing and the killer instinct. 
It may have come two games too late but it was proof their gifts had not
 deserted them.

It was 
also a reminder of Villa’s talent. A new adventure beckons in Melbourne,
 then New York, but it has to be lamented he is departing both the 
European and international scene.

He is a wonderful striker, one who has
 the talents to thrive in the Champions League.

Once Villa
 had put Spain in front, the outcome was never in doubt. The surface in 
Curibita may not have been smooth but they still passed Australia to 
death, Iniesta picking out Fernando Torres for the second in the 69th 
minute before Juan Mata converted a pinpoint Cesc Fabregas ball late on.

That gave 
the score a realistic look but there were no smiles or warm embraces at 
the final whistle, no mood for celebration.

Then again, we should not be
 surprised. This era, after all, was supposed to end in a blaze of 
glory, not with ignominious failure.
