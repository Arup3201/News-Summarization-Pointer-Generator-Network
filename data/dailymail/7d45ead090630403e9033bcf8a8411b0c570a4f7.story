As Newsnight’s fearsome interrogator, Jeremy Paxman has become notorious for extracting the truth from business leaders and politicians.

Now, however, he is putting his own employer under the spotlight.

The presenter has accused the BBC of pogonophobia – that is, an irrational fear of beards. And he is launching a one-man crusade to end discrimination against unshaven men.

Shock: Jeremy Paxman's near beard on Newsnight became one of the most talked about things on Twitter 

In on the act: Fellow Nerwsnight presenter Emily Maitlis joined in the fun and joked about growing a moustache

The 63-year-old’s appearance on Newsnight sporting a newly hirsute chin caused a media storm yesterday.

Although reactions to his new look 
were divided – with some viewers saying he looked like a ‘rubbish Doctor
Who’ – Paxman insisted he would not bow to demands to shave it off.

He said: ‘I have grown a beard for the last few summers, and suddenly wondered whether I really needed to shave it off.

‘Unless you’re lucky enough to be 
Uncle Albert on Only Fools and Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza, the 
BBC is generally as pogonophobic as the late-lamented Albanian dictator,
Enver Hoxha.

‘I may keep it or I may shave it off, but I think I’ll make my own decision.’

Communist Hoxha, who ruled Albania for
40 years until his death in 1985, made all beards in the country 
illegal because he regarded them as unhygienic.

Some had a similar aversion to Paxman’s effort when he unveiled it for the first time on Monday night.

Within minutes of his appearance, it 
became one of the most talked-about subjects on Twitter. Paxman’s 
colleague Emily Maitlis responded by joking: ‘Right that’s it. I’m 
working on a moustache for Thursday’s Newsnight.’

Before long, doctored photos of Miss 
Maitlis sporting a pair of handlebars were circulating online. She 
posted the image on her own Twitter profile, saying: ‘I remind myself of
Peter Mandelson.’

Shortly after Paxman’s comments, other BBC presenters came forward with their own tales of beard discrimination.

Ben Fogle, who shot to fame on 
Castaway in 2000 before presenting Countryfile, said: ‘Lots of stories 
about beardism out there. I was once told I’d lose my job if I didn’t 
lose the beard. I have Paxman beard envy.

‘Every time I grow one I get told to shave by television execs. TV hates a good beard.’

Meanwhile Robin Lustig, the retired 
presenter of Radio 4’s World Tonight programme, said: ‘I was told that 
if I seriously wanted to do more, I would have to get rid of my beard.’

Other BBC stars to face anti-beard 
diktats include newsreader Michael Buerk, who was ordered to shave in 
1999 after returning from a family holiday, and Keith Graves, who said 
he was taken off the shortlist to host the Nine O’Clock News because of 
his beard.

Paxman has not always been such a staunch supporter of the right to grow facial hair.

On Newsnight in 1997 he questioned why
Labour MP Frank Dobson had been made Health Secretary, adding in an 
exasperated tone: ‘But he’s got a beard!’
