A former amateur racing driver yesterday claimed that he was ‘hypnotised’ into falling in love with a petite blonde psychic who read his palm - after spending £12,000 on her during a ten-month affair.

Father-of-two Jim Gotobed, 50, of Romford, Essex, divorced his wife following the affair - and told a court that he came out of each Tarot session ‘more deeply in love’ with psychic Tracie Long, 48.

The story unravelled at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court as Mr Gotobed - who had divorced Josie, his wife of 25 years - was cleared of criminal activity after being accused of harassing the psychic.

Ms Long, of Chelmsford, had accused 
him of repeatedly texting her, writing to her parents, speaking to a 
local newspaper, reporting her to the Spiritual Workers Association and 
threatening to kill her.

But
the magistrates said they believed Mr Gotobed's version of events, 
saying Ms Long had been ‘evasive’ in her testimony, whereas Mr Gotobed 
had been ‘honest, straightforward and convincing’.

After the day-long trial at the 
magistrates' court, Mr Gotobed admitted he had been ‘gullible’, saying: 
‘I realise now she was after my money and am over her because of what 
she has done.’

He had known
the psychic 30 years earlier and their friendship was rekindled through
Facebook. Mr Gotobed said that Ms Long began doing Tarot readings for 
him - although she denied that in court.

On the first reading of the cards she 
spoke of a ‘dark force about him’, he told the court, adding that she 
had said it related to his marriage and that he should ‘get a quick 
divorce’.

Motor: The MG Midget which Mr Gotobed used to race all over the country. It was his pride and joy and he sold it on the advice of his Ms Long, a court heard

He told the court his readings ‘showed a need for money.’ As a result he sold his prized racing car, other cars, his guns and guitars. He said he did this because she said he should ‘unburden himself’.

Mr Gotobed also arranged for his wages to be paid into her account and then handed in his notice at an insulation firm in Barking, east London, after she told him he wasn't earning enough.

Asked if his decisions were of his own free will, Mr Gotobed told magistrates: ‘There were things I did which people know I would never have done. I would never have got divorced. I got divorced.’

He said she had told him their future 
was predicted in the cards and that he would marry her by Christmas last
year. In fact he is now back with his former wife and they are planning
to re-marry.

But he said 
he was distraught when Ms Long inexplicably ended their relationship. 
She had told the court: ‘He rang and said “I'm going to shoot you. I'm 
going to ruin your life”.’

Hearing: The story unravelled at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court (pictured) as Mr Gotobed - who had divorced Josie, his wife of 25 years - was cleared of criminal activity after being accused of harassing the psychic

But in his evidence he said he would ‘never have harmed her’.

Mr
Gotobed said he complained about Ms Long to the SWA, based in Bridgend,
Wales. He said she had caused him financial and mental trouble - and he
wanted to stop her ‘duping’ others.

However the SWA’s investigation concluded Ms Long had not broken its ethical code or breached consumer protection regulations - and reinstated her membership.

In her evidence, Ms Long, who also does readings by email and phone, claimed Mr Gotobed had thrown her out of his home last October.

She said she then made it clear she was no longer interested and told him to stop contacting her, but he carried on trying to win her back. She described his love as ‘obsessed’.

Ms Long said she felt anxious as he seemed erratic. She added that she was embarrassed he had complained to the spiritualist association and the local paper had run an article about her.

The psychic said she had only given him a non-professional ‘mini reading’ and denied telling him in a reading that they would be married by Christmas.
