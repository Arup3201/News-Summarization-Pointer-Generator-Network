Jailed: Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman was given a  10-year minimum life sentence

The wife of a marine jailed for executing a Taliban fighter has denied that he is a murderer.

Sergeant Alexander Blackman was given a life sentence for the killing earlier this month.

Video footage played at his trial showed Sgt Blackman shooting dead the captured insurgent at close range. The soldier, known throughout his trial as Marine A, must serve a minimum of ten years.

The head of the Armed Forces, General Sir Nick Houghton, was extremely critical of Sgt Blackman’s conduct, insisting he had committed a ‘heinous crime’ and that ‘murder is murder’.

But his wife Claire has criticised the sentence, insisting that her husband must not be compared to a common murderer.

‘He’s held his hands up,’ she said. ‘What he has not done in my eyes is commit murder. He genuinely thought, and I have absolutely no reason to disbelieve him, that that insurgent was already dead.’

She said her husband is ashamed of his actions, and that his behaviour was a moment of madness brought on by the mental strain of active service.

She told the Daily Telegraph: ‘He’s been convicted of murder, but everything that defines Al points me and everyone who knows him in completely the opposite direction – he is not made that way.

‘If you ask someone what murder is in this country, they might say someone stabbing a little old lady in the high street. Death on active service in a war zone in somewhere like Afghanistan is, sadly, an everyday occurrence. I can’t really imagine the horror or the pressure those lads were under.’

The case of Marine A provoked an outpouring of public support from those who believe his sentence was unduly harsh. By last night more than 41,000 people had signed a petition to Downing Street calling for his immediate release.

Shooting: Footage captured by a camera mounted on the helmet of a Royal Marine showing Sgt Alexander Blackman during a patrol in Afghanistan in which an insurgent was killed

Mrs Blackman, 42, said: ‘He should not have discharged his weapon into him – it was the madness of the moment – and he sure as hell wished he hadn’t either ... but he is not a murderer.

‘He can’t undo it, and he’s ashamed of it, but I still don’t think it should have led to where we are now.’

Sgt Blackman was convicted last week by a seven-strong military board. The killing had been inadvertently filmed on a helmet camera. The captured footage showed Sgt Blackman shooting the unnamed Taliban fighter in the chest at close range and then asking his colleagues not to tell anyone because he had ‘broken the Geneva Convention’.

Since the sentencing, Sgt Blackman has been placed under special protection measures in prison amid fears he could be attacked. His lawyers have said they will appeal against his sentence.
