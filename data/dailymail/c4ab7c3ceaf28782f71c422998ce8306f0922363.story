A Taliban leader who was the target of a Nato helicopter that crashed leaving 38 dead last month has been killed, military leaders said today.

Qari Tahir and a close associate were killed yesterday in Wardak province following a strike by coalition forces, NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in a statement.

Tahir was being hunted last month by a CH-47 Chinook helicopter when it was shot down rocket-propelled grenade in Wardak province, in eastern Afghanistan.

The crash killed 38 people, including 30 Americans. Many of the 30 Americans who died in the crash last month were Navy SEALs from the unit behind the killing of Al Qaeda's Osama Bin Laden.

It was the biggest single loss of life for international forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began 10 years ago.

The insurgents behind the attack were later killed in an F-16 air strike but Tahir had remained at large.

His death will be a breakthrough for U.S. troops as they struggle to contain insurgents.

'Tahir coordinated ambush attacks against Afghan forces and led fighters under his control to conduct hijackings of convoy vehicles. Additionally, he facilitated abductions and held his hostages for ransom,' ISAF said.

'Tahir was the Taliban's top leader in Tangi Valley and was the target of a previous combined operation on August 5, 2011, that resulted in the loss of the CH-47 Chinook last month.

'He led a group of insurgent fighters throughout the valley and was known to use roadside bombs and rockets to intimidate the local populace.'

The Chinook attack in August was the deadliest single mission of the Afghanistan war and the names.

The troops came from two dozen states and all corners of the nation, mostly young men in their twenties and thirties. Florida, Minnesota, Hawaii and Massachusetts are just some of the states represented.

The crash came amid fears that the country is far from stable even though U.S. and NATO forces have begun to leave Afghanistan. U.S. military officials have tried to counter those fears, saying that while the downing of the Chinook was a tragic setback, one crash will not determine the course of the war.

The total number of troops from coalition forces now killed so far in the Afghanistan conflict is 2,730 according to independent website iCasualties.org.
