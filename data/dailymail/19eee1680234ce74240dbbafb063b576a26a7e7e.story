The family of an Atlanta teen claim that doctors at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta have condemned him to a 'death sentence' because they will not place him on the transplant waiting list.

Suffering an enlarged heart, Anthony Stokes, 15, has only six months to live, but his hospital said last week that because he has failed to take his medication in the past, this history of 'non-compliance' rules him out.

His outraged family and civil rights groups claim that this is not the whole truth and say that it is Anthony's low grades at school and brushes with the law that mean Children's Healthcare will send him home from hospital with no hope of survival.

Desperate: Anthony Stokes, 15, needs a heart transplant or he will most likely die within six months

'He's been given a death sentence because of a broad and vague excuse of noncompliance. There was nothing specific in that decision. Just noncompliance,' said Christine Young Brown with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

Previously healthy, Anthony discovered last month that his heart was failing.

'Every day is up and down. He's OK one minute, the next minute he's not,' said Anthony's mother, Melencia Hamilton to CBS Atlanta.

Despite specialists informing Anthony and his family that he has less than a year to live, they also sent them a letter on August 7th, explaining why he wouldn't be put on the transplant list.

'The decision was made that Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of non-compliance, which is one of our center’s contraindications to listing for heart transplant,' explained the devastating letter.

'As we discussed today with Anthony’s mother, we will not place Anthony on the heart transplant waiting list at this time due to this decision,' the letter continues.

While the transplant list does have specific criteria for who qualifies for transplants, family and friends of Anthony allege that his low school grades and prior brushes with the law are the real reason he has been ruled out.

'The non-compliance is fabricating, because they don’t want to give him a heart,” said family friend Mack Major to WSBTV.com.

'This is unacceptable because he must lose his life because of a non-compliance.'

The hospital has refuted any claims of mismanagement in a statement in which they repeat their claims of careful management of the transplant list.

'The well-being of our patients is always our first priority. We are continuing to work with this family and looking at all options regarding this patient's health care,' said Children's Healthcare of Atlanta spokeswoman Patty Gregory.

'We follow very specific criteria in determining eligibility for a transplant of any kind.'

Anthony's mother described the moment she was told by the hospital her son would not be getting the transplant he needs to live.

'Doctor came in and said he's not a candidate. He's not a candidate for a heart transplant,' said Hamilton.

Family members said that the hospital explained that they fear that Anthony won't follow the strict plan of medication and follow-up treatments necessary for the transplant to succeed.

It is not clear what evidence of 'non-compliance' the hospital is basing their decision on.

'We must save Anthony's life. We don't have a lot of time to do it, but it's something that must be done,' said Mack Major, Stokes' mentor.
