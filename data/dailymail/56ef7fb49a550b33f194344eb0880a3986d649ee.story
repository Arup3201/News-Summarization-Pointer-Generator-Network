A man's plan to extract money from a female driver by pretending she had hit him with her car backfired spectacularly when the woman in question actually did run him over.

The bizarre incident took place in Fuzhou, capital of southern China's Fujian province, and was captured by the dash cam of a nearby car.

At the beginning of the clip, the man is seen walking towards a car, appearing to be trying to flag it down.

Flagging down: A suspected con man attempts to get the attention of a female driver

Ploy: After she stops the man dramatically falls over, seemingly not having touched the car 

Calamity: But then the driver of the car, apparently having been startled, moves forward and runs the suspected con artist over for real

The car, which is travelling at walking speed, comes to a halt – and the man dramatically falls over in front of it.

He doesn’t appear to make any contact with the car.

It is unknown if the woman driving the car failed to see him or simply became flustered when she was beeped from behind, but she suddenly steps on the accelerator and runs the man over for real.

Hearing his screams she stops the car, which is still pinning the man to the ground, and gets out.

Pinned down: The driver now has the man trapped underneath her car and screaming for help

How the scenario ends and the fates of the driver and the would-be con artist are unknown.

The video follows news of a brand new car that destroyed a house after being driven into it by accident.

The house belonged to the parents of the female driver, who just wanted to show the car off to them.

Ye Chia, 29, arrived at the property in Gaoli village in the city of Wenzhou in east China’s Zhejiang province, with her husband and two daughters, and attempted to park her shiny new white car at the front.

But she accidentally stepped on the accelerator instead of the brake and demolished not just her car, but part of her parents' house as well.
