He was taken off injured in the 81st minute as Bayern cruised to the Champions League knockout stage after their win over the Italians secured them top spot in Group E.

'There is a problem with David. He was injured,' Bayern coach Pep Guardiola told reporters. 'He will get checked out tomorrow when we will know more.'

The club later said on Twitter the player sustained 'a medial collateral ligament injury'.

Bayern were already without a string of key injured midfielders including Bastian Schweinsteiger, Javi Martinez and Thiago Alcantara.
