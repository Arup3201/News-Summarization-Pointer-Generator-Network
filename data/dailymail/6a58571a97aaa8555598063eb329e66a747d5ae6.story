Rising star James Vince and Jonathan Trott shared a century stand to preserve England Lions' chances of drawing the second unofficial Test against South Africa A.

The fourth-wicket pair joined forces still 80 runs behind, after Adam Lyth and Alex Lees had departed in quick succession following their own 77-run partnership on day three of four in Bloemfontein.

Vince (61no) and Trott (53) responded by keeping the home attack at bay for almost 29 overs, the captain reaching his half-century with his seventh four off the 80th ball he faced before being lbw to Test off-spinner Dane Piedt to end a stand of 115.

Heavy rain and bad light restricted play after tea, the Lions eventually closing on 212 for four - but only 51 in front - with Vince still unbeaten, having completed his 110-ball 50 with his ninth boundary.

Seamers Boyd Rankin (four for 78) and Liam Plunkett (three for 75) were earlier both in the wickets again as the hosts, resuming on 389 for seven, were all out for 421.

Trott's tourists conceded a lead of 161 and were almost immediately in more trouble when Test opener Sam Robson edged Rory Kleinveldt on to his stumps for a golden duck, his second single-figure failure of the match.

Opener Lyth and Lees tried to effect a lasting recovery, but the Lions were 81 for three after the Yorkshire left-handers fell in the space of two overs to teenage seamer Kagiso Rabada.

Lyth edged an attempted drive to slip, and then Lees was bowled off his pads.

Much therefore depended on Trott and Vince, who did not disappoint and made a stalemate marginally the most likely outcome on the final day - a result which would close out a 0-0 drawn series.
