It was a fight to the death, but in this case there were two winners.

Barack Obama continued a White House tradition today when he pardoned two turkeys destined for the Thanksgiving dinner table.

But it was his 12-year-old daughter Sasha who almost stole the show today in a bold outfit including red jeans and green Doc Marten boots with yellow laces.

Two birds from Badger, Minnesota, named Popcorn and Caramel ended up as the lucky pair pardoned by Obama, although only the former got to meet face-to-face with the President.

Obama joked at the ceremony that his office carries many responsibilities 'but this is not one of them'.

‘Quite literally the Hunger Games,’ joked the president. And while Popcorn was chosen by social media voters as the best, both birds Obama called the ‘top tributes’ will now safely live out their lives at Mount Vernon.

‘Even a turkey with a funny name can find a place in politics’ the president continued as the political themed turkey came one by one.

‘Carmel is already raising money for his next campaign,’ the president said, flanked by daughters Sasha and Malia.

The turkeys came from a farm in Badger, Minnesota, where most of the other birds will soon wind up on dinner tables.

But thanks to a tradition begun by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, one bird a year has avoided that fate ever since.

Stand up guy: The president took the festive opportunity of the National THanksgiving Turkey pardon to try his hand at comedy

This year, two birds will be spared, but only Popcorn has been named National Thanksgiving Turkey.’

He was chosen by voters on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram who hashtagged, regrammed, and ‘liked’ the 37 pound fowl to victory.

‘Now, before these turkeys get away,’ said the president, ‘I want to grant Popcorn a full reprieve.’

And with a wave of his executive hand, the deed was done.

Brother birds: Caramel and Popcorn are presented to the press one day before Popcorn was named the National Thanksgiving Turkey

Thin to win: The White House website has dedicated a full page to its chosen ones, brothers Caramel and Popcorn, who were the top two of some 80 birds. The site even offers visitors the chance to listen to the unique gobble of each respective bird. Popcorn, the lighter of the two, became the National Thanksgiving turkey on Wednesday

‘You have a full reprieve from cranberry sauce and stuffing,’ Obama said. ‘We’re gonna give caramel a break as well.’

The two turkeys will now live out their days at George Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon, Virginia.

They’ll be alone, though, because all the other pardoned turkeys are dead. Even the six pardoned by Barack Obama.

Something to crow about: Caramel and Popcorn will both survive the holiday season, and, if they are lucky, be able to live out their golden years for awhile yet

Settling in: One perk to being the National Thanksgiving Turkey is the real estate! Popcorn and Caramel will live out the remainder of their lives at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate in Virginia

That’s because the breed isn’t cut out for much besides filling up American tables and bellies on Turkey Day.

‘The
bird is bred for the table, not for longevity,’ Dean Norton, who’s in 
charge of livestock at Mount Vernon, told CNN. ‘Some of [the pardoned 
turkeys] have been pretty short lived.’

Domesticated turkeys are slaughtered at after living mere months, and often can’t survive much longer than that when spared.

But at least for now, Popcorn and Caramel will survive to cluck another day. Or so.

When all was said and done, both Popcorn and his brother Caramel were pardoned from being eaten on Thanksgiving. And they won't be eaten next year, either, since they'll both in all likelihood be dead

Candle in the wind: This turkey at a Massachusetts farm won't be as lucky as Popcorn and Caramel. But the domesticated turkeys won't live long even at Mount Vernon. Many don't even live as long as a year

Lonely at the top: Popcorn may have been riding high on the horse Wednesday afternoon, but he and Caramel will be the only turkeys at Mount Vernon because all the other National Thanksgiving Turkeys have gone to turkey heaven

For now, Popcorn can rest easy knowing that he'll be well fed, protected from foxes, and admired by tourists for the rest of his days at Mount Vernon in Virginia
