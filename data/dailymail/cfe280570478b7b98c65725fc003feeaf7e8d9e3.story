A dramatic video has captured the moment a pair of teenagers were airlifted off a 8,600-foot-high cliff in high winds.

The boys, aged 16 and 17, were rescued after becoming stranded on the cliff in the Sierra Buttes in Northern California on Saturday.

The pair had become stuck on the narrow shelf while hiking and a helicopter and a small plane were sent to rescue them by the California Highway Patrol.
