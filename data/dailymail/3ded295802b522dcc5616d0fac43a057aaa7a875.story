A former New Jersey firefighter has been charged with manslaughter for the death of his 10-week-old son two years ago.

Michael Marrara Jr., 33, of Boca Raton, Florida, caused a significant brain injury, broke three of the child’s ribs and left various bruises on him during his short life, authorities said. Andrew Marrara died March 26, 2012.

Marrara was first charged last June but charges have since been upgraded from assault to first-degree aggravated manslaughter, according to the Bergen Record.

He was a volunteer firefighter in Fort Lee before moving to Florida following his son’s death and has earned a living as an electrician since, according to his Facebook profile.

The Florida man was originally charged last year with aggravated assault, two counts of child endangerment and for lying to investigators, records showed

‘We believed that he was involved in the child’s death - it just took a little time for our work to be completed with the Medical Examiner’s Office,’ Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli told the Cliffview Pilot at the time.

The infant’s death was originally blamed
 on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

But authorities soon began 
insisting it was a homicide, and evidence uncovered during the course of the investigation led prosecutors to upgrade the charges.

Marrara appears to have moved on with his life in the months and years since his son’s death – posting grinning pictures to Facebook even including a fake mug shot while donning a zoot suit.

He even posted to Facebook a picture of a tattoo on his right arm of his dead son on Father’s Day.

His parents also insisted to the Record last year he did not have any involvement in the baby’s death.

‘The truth will come out,’ said father Michael Marrara.

Mother Katherine Marrara called her son ‘the most gentle, loving, tender father.’

Marrara and the child's mother have remained together in the time since, they are listed on Facebook as engaged.

An attorney for Marrara argued Monday in court that a medical expert retained by the defense team concluded Andrew Marrara died from blood clots on the brain, according to the Record.

He also claimed the child’s ribs were likely broken during his birth.

Marrara remains free on a $250,000 bond.
