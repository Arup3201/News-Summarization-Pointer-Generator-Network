The young man and the sea...

During a moment that would have made famed marlin hunter Ernest Hemingway jealous, a Brooklyn teenager hauled in the year's biggest blue marlin off the coast of Kona, Hawaii.

The fish 16-year-old Kai Rizzuto caught weighs 1,058lbs and measures 11 feet from tip to tail.

Rizzuto, the grandson of sport fishing writer Jim Rizzuto, snagged the rare 'grander' blue marlin earlier this week and the moment was captured on video.

When the five people on the boat finally got it aboard, the fish barely fit and its tail was hanging off the end

The teen was finally able to get the marlin aboard the 45-foot Monterey fishing boat he was on after a struggle that lasted for about a half an hour, HawaiiNewsNow reported. 

The so-called grander, which get its name because it weighs more than 1,000lbs, died during the fight. 

Rizzuto said: 'I'll tell you it was the hardest 30 minutes I've ever fought a fish. 

'When I saw that fish at the end of line I was just thinking, don't break off. Do not break off.'

When the fish was finally hauled in, it barely fit on the boat. 

It took all five people aboard the boat to secure the fish for measurements.

The boat's captain, McGrew Rice, called the catch, 'the fish of a lifetime', according to NBC News.

'That's like hitting a grand slam home run in the last inning of the World Series.'

It was the third grander Rice and his crew have ever brought aboard the boat.

The marlin was the first grander of the year off the coast of Kona and Rizzuto’s first blue marlin as well

It was Rizzuto’s first blue marlin and the first grander of the year in Kona, GrindTV reported.  

Rizzuto's uncle said his nephew 'doesn't have to worry about what he's going to write his college essay about'.

He added: 'Marlin meat is very nutritious and is used in a lot of dishes, from poke and sashimi to sausages, jerky, tacos, fish cake and other delicacies. 

'This fish was shared widely and there are probably more than 100 people enjoying it now.”

The largest marlin on record weighed 1,560lbs and was caught in 1953 off the coast of Peru.

 The meat on the fish, which is called a grander because it weighs more than 1,000lbs. did not go to waste
