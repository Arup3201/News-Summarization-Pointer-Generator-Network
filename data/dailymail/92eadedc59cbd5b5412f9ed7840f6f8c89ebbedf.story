Hillary Rodham Clinton says she has 'moved on' from the Monica Lewinsky scandal and told everyone else to do the same.

The former Secretary of State also revealed she did not read an essay Ms Lewinsky wrote for last month's Vanity Fair magazine that focuses on the scandal that dominated Bill Clinton's second term as president.

In an interview for this week's People magazine, Mrs Clinton said: 'I think everybody needs to look to the future,' referring to Ms Lewinsky.

She also refused to confirm or deny calling her a 'narcissistic looney toon' after the affair became public.

The comments are the first time Mrs Clinton has publicly addressed questions about Ms Lewinksky since the scandal was brought back into the spotlight earlier this year.

In January, Senator Rand Paul countered claims that the Republican Party had waged 'a war on women' by stating President Bill Clinton had taken advantage of a young intern in a 'predatory' fashion.

In February, The Washington Free Beacon published a collection of White House-era documents from Mrs Clinton's friend Diane D. Blair who died in 2000, which included diary entries based on conversations with Mrs Clinton about Ms Lewinsky.

Then came May's Vanity Fair piece. In the article, which features photos of a posed up Ms Lewinsky in a white dress, the former White House intern said she found Mrs Clinton's 'impulse to blame the woman - not only me, but herself - troubling.'

In the 
People interview, Mrs Clinton explains that becoming a grandmother - Chelsea 
Clinton's first child is due in the fall - may impact on whether she 
runs for president in 2016.

'I
 know I have a decision to make,' she told the magazine in what was her 
first at-home interview since the end of Mr Clinton's presidency in 
January 2001.

'But part of what I've been thinking about, is everything I'm interested in and everything I enjoy doing - and with the extra added joy of "I'm about to become a grandmother," I want to live in the moment.'

At the same time, however, she added: 'I am concerned about what I see happening in the country and in the world. Through the next months, I will think more about what role I can or, in my mind, should play.'

The comments come after her former boss - President Barack Obama - said he thinks she would be a 'very effective' president if she decides to run.

The President praised his former Secretary of State during an interview for Live with Kelly and Michael at the White House that aired last Friday.

'Hillary and I, we're buddies,' he said in the interview.

'I think because we ran in the longest primary in history and our staffs, I think, were doing battle politically, I think the perception was that this was always kind of a marriage of convenience when she came in as secretary of State.

'I always admired her. As soon as she got here, she couldn't have been more effective, more loyal and since that time, we've become really, really good friends.'

Discussing life after government, Mrs Clinton told People that while she fantasized for years about sleeping in, she only made it to 8a.m.

'That's good, huh?' she said with a chuckle.

Her new life also consists of binge-watching TV with her husband. Particularly the political drama  House of Cards.

Part of the appeal, she explained, was 'a little bit of the, "Oh, my gosh, I can't believe we can just sit here and do this" and "We're only going to watch one episode, oh, let's watch another. Okay, well, we have time, we're not going anywhere, let's watch a third." I know that sounds kind of devoid of content.'

Mrs Clinton told People she was enjoying not stressing about her hair now she's hit 66.

'Hair
 strategies are essential to everything in life, we know that. I'm at an
 age where I can pretty much do what I want: Here I am, whether you like
 my hair or not,' she said.

And responding to a question about her husband's thin frame, she said Bill was in good health.

'People say he's too thin. He doesn't think so and he has an enormous amount of energy.'

As well as catching up on lost sleep, Mrs Clinton has been heavily involved, as Chelsea now is, in the Clinton Foundation, advocating important projects to stop poaching elephants in Africa and to improve the global status of women and girls.

Now, With her state department memoir Hard Choices hitting shelves, she is back on the road, launching a nationwide book tour on June 10.
