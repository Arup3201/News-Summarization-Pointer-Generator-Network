A car which belonged to one of the biggest names in the history of Hollywood cowboy films is set to fetch more than £130,000 when it goes under the hammer in a UK auction.

With its impressive Hollywood history and a whopping a 7.7L engine, the incredible Rolls Royce Phantom I Playboy Roadster is expected to cause a stampede of interest from film buffs around the world.

Auctioneers estimate the hammer will fall in excess of £120,000 for the 1927 model once owned by Tom Mix, one of Hollywood’s finest stars during the 1920’s.

Cowboy Tom was the biggest names of the Hollywood silent film generation, appearing in a staggering 291 films between Between 1909 and 1935.

He bought the car in 1933 and  spruced it up with the latest features to ensure that it was special enough to be driven by a star such as himself.

The headlights were lowered, the wings underwent a radical updating, a fog light was added and an ultra-modern radio was built into the dash.

Despite being 85 years old, the beautiful motor still has a top speed of 90mph enough to send any bidder sailing happily into the sunset.

The lot is due to go under the hammer at Coys specialist motor auction this Saturday at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and has been drawing lots of attention from film fans with enough cash to splash.

Potential bidders have also been impressed by the chance to own a car with such a dazzling Hollywood history outside of the US.

Tom was fatally injured in a car crash with his other classic car, a Cord L29 in 1940 but this was not the end of the Rolls’ big screen roles.

Warner Brothers snapped up the car after Tom’s death and it spent the next three decades making appearances in some of their classic films.

The Hollywood great Robert Redford got behind the wheel of the Rolls Royce in the 1965 film Daisy Clover.

Since then two collectors have carefully maintained the Phantom to the pristine condition that it’s now being sold in.

Coys’ auctioneer, Chris Routledge said: 
'The valuation on this car is about what we’d expect but because of the 
brilliant history that comes with it, the sky really is the limit for 
how much this car will sell for.

'It’s the only car of this type in the world so we’ve had a lot of interest from Japan and America.

'The only reason that we have this car is because it’s coming from a deceased estate, otherwise it’s unlikely that anything of this sort would ever come up for sale.

'It’s always fascinating in this line of work when a car like this comes up for sale.

'It’s very exciting especially because of it’s California and Hollywood links.'

Thomas Edwin 'Tom' Mix  was Hollywood's first western megastar appearing in an incredible 291 films between 1909 and 1935.

A real-life cowboy, he worked as a ranch hand and was an excellent shot and and expert with a lasso.

His first film The Cowboy Millionaire, was released on October 21, 1909 after which his popularity exploded. As his fame grew he was able to command hefty sums for his appearances.

Married five times, his style would go on to define the Hollywood western genre and influence future screen cowboy's such as Ronald Reagan and John Wayne.

It was on the afternoon of October 12, 1940, that the 60-year-old Mix, was driving another of his cars, a 1937 Cord 812 Phaeton,on Arizona State Route 79 near Florence.

He had been visiting Pima County Sheriff Ed Nichols in Tucson but had stopped at a gambling and drinking den the Oracle Junction Inn,

He was reportedly driving at around 80mph when he rolled the car into a gulley.

On the package shelf behind him was an aluminum suitcase containing  a large amount of cash as well as traveller's cheques and jewels.

It reportedly slammed into back of the head, shattering his skull and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly.

There is a small memorial stone marking the site of his death and the nearby gully is named 'Tom Mix Wash'.

Mix famously appears on the cover of the Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band designed by Peter Blake.
