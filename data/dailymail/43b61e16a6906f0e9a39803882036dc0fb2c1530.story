A town was in shock last night after nine-year-old twins were killed by their brother in an appalling family tragedy.

Tommy and Patrick O’Driscoll were stabbed to death by their  22-year-old brother Jonathan, who fled the scene at Charleville, County Cork, Ireland and later took his own life.

Parents Thomas and Ellen O’Driscoll had been on a shopping trip – to a town just six miles away – and had left Jonathan in charge.

Twin boys have been found dead at a home in Deerpark, Charleville, County Cork while the body of a third member of the same family, a man in his 20s, was found 10 miles away in a suspected double murder and suicide

Sources
 close to the investigation said: ‘This is the most horrific crime we’ve
 ever had to deal with. It is hard to see what would spark something 
like this.’

It emerged last 
night that the bodies of the twin boys were discovered in separate 
bedrooms by their younger brothers who are aged three and five.

Neighbours
 who came running to the house after hearing the children’s cries for 
help saw a car being driving away at speed. Within an hour, the car was 
found in Buttevant, also in Co. Cork. Jonathan’s body was found nearby; 
foul play is not suspected in his death.

There
 was speculation last night that Jonathan had recently learned that he 
was adopted, and that he killed his brothers in a fit of rage.

Last night details about the tragedy were still emerging.

Earlier,
 the twins’ elder brother Jonathan had picked the boys up from school in
 nearby Banogue, and he had been tasked with minding his younger 
siblings.

Parents Thomas and Ellen, who have six children, had driven six miles to nearby Kilmallock on a shopping trip.

The two youngsters, aged nine, were found dead in their home just outside the town of Charleville in north county Cork in the Irish Republic shortly before 5pm today.
About an hour later, a relative of the boys, believed to be aged in his early 20s, was found dead in a forested area

The
 boys’ younger brothers – aged just three years and five years – 
discovered the twins’ bodies in separate bedrooms when they returned to 
their cottage home after playing outside.

A number of children ran to neighbours’ homes for help.

A
 security source said that children who had been playing near the 
O’Driscolls’ home raised the alarm. ‘Little kids found them and started 
screaming, and the alarm was raised,’ a security source said last night.

As neighbours ran to answer cries of panic, a car was seen driving away from the house at speed.

It emerged last night that children, aged ten and 14, later found the body of Jonathan O’Driscoll while playing near Buttevant.

A source said: ‘The body was found down at Buttevant Castle which lies on the edge of Buttevant, beside the Awbeg River.’

Last night, the twins’ bodies remained at the scene at Charleville, with the area sealed off for technical examination.

The office of the State Pathologist had been notified and post mortems are expected to be carried out today.

The schoolboys both received multiple stab wounds on the upper body, according to security sources last night.

Sources
 close to the investigation said that it was one of the most horrific 
scenes that they had ever encountered. ‘The family and the community are
 traumatised,’ the source said.

Up
 to 30 friends and relatives of the O’Driscoll family gathered outside 
the family home last night, where an armed patrol unit of An Garda 
Síochána was dispatched shortly after the devastating discoveries.

Late last night, the main Limerick-Cork road remained closed.

A
 spokesman for Charleville GAA Club said ‘the whole town had come to at a
 complete standstill’ and that it was ‘a tragedy for the town’.

It is understood a house has been sealed off in the Deerpark area of the town and at O'Rourke's Cross, the main Cork to Limerick Road has been closed to traffic as preliminary investigations continue

Fianna Fáil TD Michael Moynihan told the Mail that he was ‘shocked and deeply saddened’.

A
 friend of the family said last night: ‘I haven’t spoken to them yet, 
but this will kill them. Ellen was a devoted mother who worked hard to 
bring her children up right. She loved children and I think even 
fostered two and might have adopted a third. This is a terrible 
tragedy.’

The friend added: ‘It will hit both of them badly, but poor Thomas has only recently come out of hospital.’

Another
 friend told the Mail last night: ‘I don’t know all the details, but a 
neighbour heard a commotion and screams in the house. He then saw the 
older son running out of the house and then he called for help.

‘One
 of Thomas and Ellen’s sons came round very quickly, and I understand 
the two little lads were found in different rooms in the house.’

The
 brothers were pupils at Banogue NS in Croom, Co. Limerick. When 
contacted last night principal Sheila Cagney said she did not want to 
comment, saying only, ‘We are all terribly upset.’

Charleville
 priest Tom Naughton visited the grieving family last night. ‘I said 
prayers and comforted them and assured them of the ongoing support of 
everyone in Charleville,’ he said. ‘It’s just devastating.’

A well-informed source said: ‘Those poor little boys suffered a shocking death.’

Locals
 were stunned into silence for much of the day. However, as evening drew
 in, and the news began to filter through of the nature of the boys’ 
deaths, some in the town began to weep openly on the streets.
