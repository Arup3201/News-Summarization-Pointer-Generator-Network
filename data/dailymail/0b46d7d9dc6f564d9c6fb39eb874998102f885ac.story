A competition for school children has been launched to design a British-inspired, balanced meal for Major Peake (pictured) to eat during his mission to the ISS

The International Space Station may be 230miles (370km) above the Earth, but British Astronaut Tim Peake will still be able to get a taste of home thanks to a new competition.

Next year, he will begin his journey into space to spend six months on the ISS and will be able to dine on a meals created by school children – with the help of a famous chef.

The UK Space Agency has launched a competition for children between the ages of seven and 14 to design a British-inspired, balanced and exciting meal for Major Peake to enjoy during his mission.

The winning contestants will work with Heston Blumenthal to transform their ideas into real space food that will be blasted the astronaut’s temporary home.

They will also be invited to an event that will include a live link-up with Major Peake during his stay on the ISS.

‘This is a great opportunity to get people thinking about nutrition and healthy eating,’ Major Peake said.

‘I’m really excited that I’ll be able to eat a “Great British Space Dinner” onboard the space station and for me it will be a very special link back to planet Earth!’

‘I think that by blending the creativity from the competition and Heston’s expertise we can produce something that is not just fun, healthy and tasty but also food that will be really important for the future of space travel.’

Dinner time: To enter the competition, children have to take account of healthy eating principles as well as the constraints of space to design a British meal that can be packaged and preserved for the long trip. Here, astronauts show off their floating dinners aboard the ISS

A competition to name Major Peake's first mission to the ISS closed last month.

It was part of a long-held tradition in which the public choose mission names every time a European astronaut goes into orbit.

Previous mission names have included ‘Marco Polo’ for the Italian Astronaut Roberto Vittori and ‘Odissia’ for Belgian Frank de Winne.

Major Peake, 41, said: ‘The ISS is a cutting edge research laboratory that is pushing the boundaries of what is scientifically, technically and humanly possibly.

‘My six month stay onboard mankind's outpost in space is going to be both challenging and incredibly exciting.

‘The scientific experiments conducted will be wide ranging, covering areas such as medicine, human physiology, core science and material science.'

The winning entry, which has yet to be announced, will be incorporated into a logo.

Major Peake told BBC News that food on the ISS was not as 'nice as it could be' and while it is nutritious, it is often 'lacks taste and texture'.

'You don't want a mushy paste. You want something with texture and a crunch to recreate some of the memories of eating food on planet Earth,' he said.

To enter the competition to design a more satisfying meal, children have to take account of healthy eating principles as well as the constraints of space to design a British meal that can be packaged and preserved for the long trip.

There will be a winner from the primary level category and for secondary level children.

Mr Blumenthal said: ‘I’m unbelievably excited to be designing a delicious meal for Tim to enjoy in space; there are some real challenges ahead, things aren’t quite the same up there!

‘I’m really looking forward to seeing some incredible suggestions by the kids, and getting started on creating something that Tim will love up there in space.’

Lots of the food that is sent to the ISS is dehydrated and packed in vacuum bags so it is small and light. The crew mix up their food with water and often suck it straight out of the packets with straws.

As well as lacking texture, the food often seems bland to astronauts as they lose their sense of smell and therefore their taste. This happens because blood flows to their heads in zero gravity and makes their faces swell up, blocking their noses.

Before joining the Esa astronaut corps in 2009, Major Peake was a helicopter pilot and a test pilot.

He was assigned his mission in May 2013 and has been training non-stop to be part of Expedition 46/47 to the orbital outpost.

He is following a long line of British explorers and scientists, from the North Pole and the Nile to the Himalayas and now to outer space.

'As a former test-pilot I believe that knowledge is gained when we explore the boundaries of what is technically and humanly possible,' Major Peake said.

The winners of the competition will play a small part in British space history as Major Peake will become the first British astronaut to visit the International Space Station as well as the first official Briton in space.

A team of judges, which will include Major Peake, Heston Blumenthal and experts from the British Nutritional Foundation, will select the best entries from both the primary and secondary school age categories.

They will be looking for fun and healthy menus that excite Tim, have an element of Britishness, and have the potential to be transformed into a space dinner that could be flown to the ISS.

Entries must be submitted by noon on June 30 to the UK Space Agency.

There is a set of educational resources to accompany the competition entry form, which can be downloaded from the UK Space Agency’s website.
