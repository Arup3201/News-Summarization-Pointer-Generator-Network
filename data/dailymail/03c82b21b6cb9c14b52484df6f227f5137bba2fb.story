The final list for the St Louis Rams ten-player practice squad has been announced - and does not feature Michael Sam.

The defensive end, who was the first openly gay player drafted in the NFL, was among the last to be dropped on Saturday as the Missouri team announced its final pick for the 2014 season.

On Tuesday, the Rams signed ten players to their practice squad and  Sam was not among them.

So far no other team has taken the opportunity to pick him up. 

The Rams added two each at linebacker, offensive line, wide receiver and safety on Monday, fortifying needy positions. 

Sam starred at defensive line for Missouri but coach Jeff Fisher said the defensive line was the strongest group on the team. 

Rookie quarterback Garrett Gilbert and seven others were among the cuts that got the roster to 53 players.

The final announcement on the practice squad came as no surprise amid reports this weekend that Sam would be dropped.

While getting cut by the Rams means Sam's dreams of becoming the first gay NFL player have now been placed on hold, he was undeterred. He posted an upbeat message  to his Twitter account on Saturday despite his obstacles.

'The most worthwhile things in life rarely come easy, this is a lesson I've always known. The journey continues,' he wrote. 

His boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, also showed his support for Sam by tweeted a picture of the couple together, wearing shirts from the University of Missouri, where they both attended college.

Sam showed up for his face-to-face exit meeting with  Rams coach Jeff Fisher on Sunday.

He shook hands with two reporters and accepted well wishes but declined further comment before heading upstairs to see the coach. 

The Rams selected Sam, the SEC co-defensive player of the year at Missouri, with the 249th overall pick out of 256 overall during May's draft.

Sam came out following his final season at Missouri. 

Rams coach Jeff Fisher  made clear from the start that he chose Sam because he thought he had the talent to make it in the NFL. 

After he was drafted by the Rams, Sam kissed his boyfriend on live TV and arrived brimming with confidence at training camp - and with a quick retort for anyone who contended he was in the NFL only because he came out.

The cameras followed but the extra attention did not seem to faze Sam or his teammates. 

However a Buffalo Bills linebacker claimed this weekend that Sam's sexual orientation was the reason that he was no longer attached to an NFL team.   

Offensive lineman Eric Wood  blamed the media for focusing on the player's personal life.

Wood's comment came after sports commentator Ross Tucker publicly wondered on Twitter why 'Michael Sam performed much better than most expected and still isn't even on a practice squad?' 

''Blame that on espn,' Wood tweeted in response to Sam's inability to find an NFL home. 'No one wants the distraction.'' 

Sam had picked up the Arthur Ashe Courage award last month where he told the audience: 'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself.'
