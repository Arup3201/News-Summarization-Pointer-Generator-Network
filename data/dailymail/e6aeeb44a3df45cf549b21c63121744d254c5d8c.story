The grief stricken family of an honor roll student gunned while down driving home after a night playing video games joined hundreds of devastated mourners at his funeral yesterday.

A full Irish pipe and drum band sounded as a black hearse carrying Brendan Tevlin’s body arrived for the service in a long funeral procession, flanked by around a dozen police outriders.

Once inside Reverend Brian Needles paid tribute to the, ‘Amazing, gifted and respectful’ 19-year-old and spoke of his family’s, ‘unbearable pain and unrelenting grief’. He added that no one could understand why the model student’s life had been cut so tragically short.

Beloved: Hundreds of devastated mourners gathered for the funeral of 19-year-old Brendan Tevlin in Livingston, N.J., who was gunned down last week. Police remain baffled by what they say is a targeted murder

Life cut short: Rev. Brian Needles of the Church of St.Philomena officiated at the sad service. 'Brendan, an amazing gifted young man¿ with so much potential, so much to look forward to, so much to offer this world, never getting a chance, it¿s just not supposed to be like this,' he said

The pipes are calling: A full Irish pipe and drum band sounded to pay tribute to the fine young man. Brendan was also a bagpiper with the Essex County Shillelagh Pipes & Drums.

He went on to say, ‘It’s not supposed to be like this, a mother and father are not supposed to bury a child….

‘Brendan, an amazing gifted young man… with so much potential, so much to look forward to, so much to offer this world, never getting a chance, it’s just not supposed to be like this.’

At the end of the hour-and-a-half long Catholic service held at The Church of Saint Philomena, Livingston, New Jersey, Brendan’s two brothers Brian and Sean and sister Michaela paid tearful tributes to, ‘the best brother in the world’.

 

They also thanked the local community for the outpouring of grief and the countless offers of support the family has received since Brendan’s brutal slaying in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Between tears, Brendan’s sister Michaela told the congregation how he touched the lives of, ‘Every person he ever encountered’ and lived every day to the fullest. She also described him as someone who truly made a difference.

Close: Brendan, here with his younger brothers and sister Allison was the closest of siblings

At the end of the emotionally charged ceremony, that brought the small town of Livingston to a standstill, Brendan’s siblings, his father Michael, mother Allison and around a dozen other relatives comforted each other as they left the church.

They then drove off to a private burial service at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover, New Jersey.

Brendan’s family and friends have been absolutely devastated by his brutal slaying, which has left everyone who knew him utterly stunned.

After spending the evening at a friend’s house playing video games, he reportedly texted his mom to say he was heading home, before getting in the family’s Jeep Liberty between 11.30pm and 12.00am.

He stopped at a Seven Eleven, but was shot soon after. Bizarrely his car was then moved to an apartment complex around a mile away. Police found his body still in the Jeep.

The Essex County Prosecutor's Office said shortly after the attack that the killing was 'targeted.' However spokeswoman Katherine Carter would not say what evidence led detectives to conclude that Brendan was not killed at random.

Riding the waves: Brandon was an avid surfer and spent summers at the Jersey shore with his family

On Sunday police released surveillance photos showing two potential suspects racing down Walker Road and Northfield Avenue in West Orange, New Jersey around the same time that Brendan was shot.

'At this juncture of the investigation it does not appear to be random,' Anthony Ambrose, the chief of detectives for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, told The Star-Ledger.

The teen had finished his freshman year at the University of Richmond, where he was planning to major in business, the school said. He graduated last year from Seton Hall Preparatory School.

Matt Cannizzo, the director of admissions at Seton Hall, told MailOnline students and faculty are ‘stunned’ by the death.

‘He was never in any trouble. Nobody had a problem with him ever. He was a model citizen,’ Cannizzo told MailOnline.

Tevlin’s family is heavily involved in the school, where his uncle Patrick Tevlin is a former administrator and started the lacrosse program.

While at Seton Hall Prep he excelled in everything he did. According to local news source, http://thealternativepress.com/, he was a member of the Student Council and an outstanding student maintaining a 4.0 grade point average for all four years.
