From the outside, it looks very much like any other drab city high rise.

But take a peek inside, and this stunning apartment proves one should not always judge a book by its cover.

While the exterior is grey and dreary, inside the luxury pad in Gosforth, Newcastle, is sumptuously appointed, with the very best in modern design and decadent furnishings.

From the exterior, this flat in Gosforth, Newcastle, looks very much like any other city high rise

But inside, the luxury apartment of renowned interior designer George Bond is sumptuously appointed

George Bond, interior designer to 
stars such as Bianca Jagger, has lived in the apartment for the past 
year with his partner Bryan Coombs.

It
 has now been awarded the '5 star award' for 'Best Apartment Interior' 
at the International Property Awards - the first ever property outside 
London. 

The
 elegant three-bedroom flat worth around Â£500,000 has 360 degree views 
of Gosforth moor and is stuffed full to the brim with valuable antiques.

It is the first in the 19-year history of the property awards to have ever won the prestigious accolade.

The
 couple have travelled extensively throughout their lives picking up 
treasures from across the globe, and these have now been incorporated 
into the design of their palatial home.

The property is the result of meticulous planning and design by Mr Bond, and took a team of men four months to complete.

The 60-year-old, who has worked with a catalogue of famous people including Linda Barker and Carol Vorderman, said: 'I feel honoured to have won this award.

'The fact this apartment is the first outside of London to win it makes it extra special. It is wonderful to live in and when people come to visit they just say 'wow'. The dinner parties we hold here are fantastic.

'The last house we lived in was a huge mansion of a place I thought that I would feel claustrophobic moving to an apartment, but that hasn't been the case at all. The 360 degree views are amazing.'

The couple, who have been together for 34-years, moved from their Georgian farmhouse in Newcastle after 80-year-old Mr Coombs slipped on some ice and banged his head.

Sadly, Mr Coombs, who was head of business at Northumbria University, was left with a bleed on the brain which has led to dementia.

The pair decided to move because the neat open-space apartment meets their needs better than the sprawling mansion they recently sold.

Mr Bond's intention was to design a living space which was 'timeless' and 'elegant' but with a 'modern twist'.He took inspiration from his antique collection to create the 'relaxing haven' which he describes as 'a space to live, a space to move and a space to be'.

Mr Bond added: 'The award ceremony in London was a bit like the Oscars. It started at 6.30pm and my name wasn't called until 11pm. I had to stay sober until then in case I fell over.

'When my name was finally called I felt as though my feet were going to go from under me. It was a wonderful night.'
