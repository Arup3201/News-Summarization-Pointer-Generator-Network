A 22-year-old accused of gunning down his parents and brother at their home was planning a Columbine-style massacre at a local high school, police revealed.

Trey Eric Sesler, an online animation enthusiast and critic from Texas, was arrested on Tuesday after a daylong manhunt following the the discovery of the three bodies, which had multiple gunshot wounds.

Under questioning from police, he told them he and another former Waller High School student were planning a mass shooting at the school and now investigators are questioning the friend concerning the plot.

Plans: Trey Eric Sesler was said to be planning a Columbine-style massacre at the local school with a friend

Obsessed: Sesler appears to have had a fascination with guns and rifles and he posted many pictures of himself posing with them. he is believed to have shot his family with a high-powered rifle

According to the Houston Chronicle, Sesler had an obsession with the 1999 massacre in which two students shot dead 12 students and one teacher before killing themselves. He was also obsessed with guns and is believed to have had several - including handguns and high-powered rifles - at his home.

He has been charged with capital murder in the deaths of Lawton Ray Sesler Jr, 58, his wife Rhonda Wyse Sesler, 57, and their son, Mark Alan Sesler, 26, who were found dead at their one-story, ranch-style home. 

Writing was said to have been written over the walls of the home expressing remorse.

Michael Williams, a crime scene investigator and detective with the Waller Police Department, told the Chronicle that two weeks ago, Sesler made a strange call to police.

He said: 'He just called us one day about something bizarre. He said he was sitting in the backyard and that a bullet whizzed by his head and that he had gotten his guns and he was ready.'

Someone reported gunshots coming from the home on Monday evening but when police arrived they discovered nothing.

Waller County Sheriff Glenn Smith said: 'This was a scene that had a lot of violence. The house was ransacked.

'Evidence was obtained and it was pretty
 obvious the connection of the other brother and son to these people.'

Trey
 Sesler has no criminal record, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Suspected killer: A family member described Sesler as 'peculiar' but he has no criminal record and was an amine enthusiast who posted reviews online

Crime scene: The bodies of Sesler's parents and brother were discovered around 1pm at their Houston home after police received a call from concerned relatives

Waller Police Chief Phil Rehak said: 'The best way for me to describe the residence is it looked like a war zone – a tremendous amount of damage inside the residence, the crime scene was not contained to one area of the residence.

'It was from one end of the residence to the other, front to back, which is unusual.'

He was arrested at a friend's home just hours after the bodies were found. Investigators said Sesler had several guns with him at the time.

Police have said they don’t know why 
Sesler would want to kill his family, but that it was an exceptionally 
violent, angry crime.

For the last four years, he has used an 
online alter ego called Mr Anime, the star and producer of several short
 films and also a reviewer of Japanese animation.

He
 has a YouTube channel, with more than one million views which he calls 
Lenscap productions. Some of the amateur movies he made star his 
brother.

A large number of the anime he 
reviews have violent themes. For example, in one, which is called 
Highschool Of The Dead, Sesler has a large rifle in 
his hands while he talks to the camera.

YouTube: His onscreen persona is Mr Anime. He has more than 4,000 subscribers and more than one million video views

Dangerous props: In one of Sesler's YouTube videos, he waves around a large rifle while reviewing an anime called High School Of The Dead

At one point he seems to get very excited when talking about 
the zombies killing the mortals as there is 'blood everywhere'.

Yet another one is called Death Note 
and another one is called Slayers. The beginning of all of his reviews, 
he plays a short clip in which he shoots someone in the chest.

On his Facebook page he wrote: 'I 
really like to take it easy and have a nice time. I'm really interested 
in my education as a college student and am really excited about 
graduating in a few years.

'I plant things sometimes in the spring like peppers and strawberries. My car is currently the most exciting part of my days.'

Aunt Weda Frierson called her nephew 'peculiar' when interviewed by the Houston Chronicle.

She said: 'I'll have to admit, he was quite 
strange. But naturally, I wasn't going to tell Trey's parents that he 
acts peculiar.

'His father was a very private person and
 never really discussed him with me at all.'

She said she believed he was on some kind of medication for a health condition but didn't know what.

Lawton and Rhonda Sesler were married 34 years. She worked at the Waller Times. He taught at Robinson Elementary in the Cy-Fair Independent School District and grew up in Waller.

District officials said staff and students at Robinson were saddened by the news of Lawton Sesler's death.

'With more than 30 years of teaching experience, he made the difference in the lives of hundreds of students during his career,' officials said in a statement. 'He was a Spotlight teacher in 2000 and 2006, selected for his outstanding contributions as a teacher.'
