'Hard luck': Judge John Plumstead (pictured) has banned sex offender Richard Ford from having one-night stands because of his violent history towards women

A sex offender has been banned from having one-night stands because of his violent history towards women.

A judge said Richard Ford, 41, must refuse any 'offers on a plate' as unsuspecting women would not be aware of his background.

He was told to contact his probation officer if he wanted to start a relationship.

The restrictions were put in place when Ford appeared at St Albans Crown Court this week to admit to failing to notify police of a change of address after being placed on the sex offenders' register.

Judge John Plumstead  said the situation was exasperated by Ford, from New Road, Croxley Green, Rickmansworth, also breaking a restraining order.

He said: 'He has a history of violence towards women and children and has possessed images of sadism and torture. He is an extremely concerning man.

'He is not allowed to take advantage of a one-night stand offered on a plate by someone who doesn't know his background.

'He is not allowed to form relationships until probation know who with. The choice is that or jail - hard luck.'

He ordered that Ford is not allowed to stay at a woman's house, have a woman stay at his house, or stay elsewhere with a woman, unless the probation officer knows her name and address beforehand.

He said: 'Until this man sorts out 
whatever it is going on his head that makes him behave as he does, I 
have concerns about the danger he represents.

'I am going to defer the sentence so he can continue to make progress on his order. I want monthly updates on this man.

'It is crucial that he does not enter any relationships with anybody at all without the knowledge of his probation. His past of cruelty to children and violence to women is troubling.

'If he enters a relationship where there are already children, the public duty will be to inform the children's family and schools so they appropriate steps can be taken to safeguard them.'

The Judge decided not to send him to prison, but said he would force restrictions on his relationships to ensure the safety of women and children.

It was on May 24 this year when Ford appeared before Judge Plumstead at St Albans Crown Court, where he pleaded guilty to possessing extreme pornographic images, six charges of making indecent images of a child and four counts of possessing indecent images of a child.

He was sentenced to a 36-month community order and placed on supervision for 36 months and told he must attend the Thames Valley Sex Offenders Programme as directed by the probation service.

He was also made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order and his name was put on the sex offenders register for an indefinite period.

As a result, Ford was required to notify the police if he changed his address and it was his failure to do that landed him in trouble and back in court.

Deferring sentence on Ford on Wednesday, the judge told him: 'If you do not make the progress, I expect I will bring you back and sentence you to as long as I can without troubling the court of appeal.'
