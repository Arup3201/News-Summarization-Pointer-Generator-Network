Georgina Bloomberg, the daughter of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, showed off her fabulous figure just weeks after giving birth to her first child.

Miss Bloomberg, 30, who gave birth to son
 Jasper on Christmas Eve, also opened up about her new life as a mom - 
and the former mayor's new role as a grandfather.

The 30-year-old looked healthy and slim in a flowing, red strapless dress as she attended an event in Palm Beach, Florida on Sunday at the invitation of the Trump family.

Miss Bloomberg grinned as she posed for a picture alongside Ivanka Trump and her daughter Arabella at the second annual Trump Invitational Grand Prix.

Miss Bloomberg describes her 
former-mayor father as standoffish with babies, claiming that the only 
time she remembers seeing him handle one was while kissing them on the 
campaign trail.

But
 the first time he held his new grandson, Jasper Michael Brown Quintana,
 the former leader of Gotham appeared slightly more at home.

'He didn’t drop him!' Miss Bloomberg said in an exclusive interview with the New York Post on Sunday.

'He didn’t choke up or cry,' she continued, 'he was just very happy and thought Jasper was adorable.

'I’ve
 said in the past that my dad isn’t good around kids, but I guess when 
it’s your own flesh and blood, it comes more naturally.'

Shortly after little Jasper was born, her powerful father arrived at New York-Presbyterian Hospital carrying a bouquet of flowers and a gold charm bracelet for his daughter.

'He picked it out himself,' Miss Bloomberg, a 30-year-old professional horsewoman and animal rights activist, told the paper.

Georgina and the baby's father, fellow horseman Ramiro Quintana, are now sharing baby-sitting duties but she admits that she and her longtime boyfriend have hired people to help raise the young heir to the $11 billion Bloomberg fortune.

 pair: Ivanka and Georgina have more than a little in common, having 
both grown up the daughters of such powerful, wealthy men of influence

'I am lucky enough to be in a position to be able to afford help, but I 
really want to be involved and experience the responsibility and, of 
course, the bonding,' Georgina says. 'Having a baby is something I’ve 
always wanted and I’m obviously going to do as much for him myself as I 
possibly can.'

Georgina's decision to have a baby out of wedlock with her 36-year-old Argentinian-born boyfriend raised eyebrows amongst her friends and family, but she says people have accepted her non-traditional family situation, noting that becoming pregnant was 'a surprise'

'It was a happy surprise, something that we both wanted and were ready for,' she says.

'When
 it happened, we were very happy and so were our parents. My dad and I 
are different people, but we are 100 per cent supportive of each other.'

Georgina met Quintana when she was 15 and
 a member of the East Coast riding circuit. The couple dated on-and-off 
for years before becoming serious in October of 2012. The couple began 
trying to have a baby in the spring.

'Horse people': Georgina says her unorthodox living situation with boyfriend Ramiro Quintana has been accepted by their families

In September, Georgina sparked controversy when she opted to ride in the Hampton Classic while five months pregnant.

'I felt good and I just listened to my body about when it was time to 
stop,' says Georgina, who placed third in the competition. 'I was careful and chose horses which were less prone to anything 
happening.'

Georgina, it should be noted, is hoping to land a spot on the 2016 Olympic equestrian team.

While she and Quintana share an apartment in the posh Central Park West section of New York, the young heiress spends the majority of her time at her farm Upstate and at her estate in Florida.

Quintana spends his summers running a stable in Virginia.

Of their unorthodox living arrangements as young parents, Georgina says, 'Ramiro and I are horse people, first and foremost.

'That’s
 just the challenge of our lifestyle and [in the horse world] you’re not
 going to find somebody who can be by your side every day.

'At the same time, I’m not really sure I’m the sort of person who would want that either. We’re both very independent.'

The couple has no plans to marry, Georgina says, and she received no pressure from her family to tie the knot after she became pregnant.

'By now, my family has gotten used to the idea that I do things my own way,' she says.

'I love the idea of being with one person for the rest of your life, but I don’t think you need a piece of paper to do that.'
