Jump jockey Richie McGrath is facing a ban of up to 10 years after being hit with corruption charges by the BHA.

The 38-year-old, whose most prestigious win came in the 2003 Scottish Grand National on Ryalux, faces allegations that he passed on privileged inside information used for betting purposes and, most seriously, that this information came with the knowledge that McGrath would not ride his mounts on their merits to ensure either they did not win or were placed.

The BHA investigation covers 57 races from October 2009 until March 2012.

Jockey Richie McGrath has been investigated over allegations of corruption and could face a ban

McGrath hasn’t ridden since suffering a back fracture in a fall at Hexham on March 13.

The BHA has also served corruption charges on former trainer Kate Walton, McGrath’s mother-in-law, and five other licenced owners accused placing Lay Bets on Walton-trained Rumble of Thunder who figures in six of the races under scrutiny.

Central to this group is Mark Aspey, described in one report as a ‘professional gambler who makes his living betting in-running on Betfair.’

The highest profile horse he has owned is Nigel Twiston-Davies-trained Ascot and Cheltenham winner Ackertac.

A statement issued on behalf of McGrath by his legal team said: ‘Richie is shocked and bitterly disappointed to be facing charges, but vigorously maintains his innocence and intends to fight to clear his name, however financially straining that may be.‘ 

However, this case yet again highlights the vast imbalance in resources between the prosecuting authority and those who have to defend themselves, often with their livelihood at stake.

‘A fair hearing demands a level playing field, but these cases are rarely played out on such a surface.’

McGrath has stood down from his position as a Board member of the Professional Jockeys Association.

Seven days have been set aside for the hearing starting on November 11.
