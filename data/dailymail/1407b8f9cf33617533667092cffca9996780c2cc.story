Major James Bowman was shot during his sleep by Talib Hussein

Three British troops were slaughtered by a rogue Afghan soldier after a row over bottled water, an inquest heard.

Major James Bowman, 34, Lieutenant Neal Turkington, 26, and Corporal Arjun Purja Pun, 33, were killed after ‘incidents of friction’ between UK and Afghan forces.

The murderer launched a machine-gun and rocket-propelled grenade attack against the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles under cover of darkness.

Talib Hussein, 23, later claimed responsibility for the massacre, blaming ‘anger’ at British troops’ conduct at a military compound near Babaji in central Helmand.

Hussein, a sergeant, had been living, eating, sleeping and fighting with the Royal Gurkhas, who were training and mentoring the Afghan National Army (ANA).

Details surrounding the attack emerged for the first time yesterday at the inquest in Trowbridge, Wiltshire.

Lieutenant Colonel Gerald Strickland, the battalion’s commanding officer, told of tensions between British and Afghan troops at Patrol Base Three.

In May last year, a Gurkha religious temple in the fortress was vandalised after an Afghan soldier was reprimanded for taking bottles of chilled water.

A few weeks later a member of the ANA was accidentally shot dead by a Gurkha who mistakenly feared he was being attacked while on patrol.

Lt Col Strickland said: ‘There were no 
recriminations at all as a result of it. It was accepted by the Afghans 
as something that happened.’

Later however, at around 2.40am on July 13 last year, Hussein shot dead Major Bowman, of Salisbury, Wiltshire, as he slept in his tent.

Then he fired a rocket-propelled 
grenade into the shipping container used as the base’s command centre, 
killing Lt Turkington, of Craigavon, Northern Ireland, and Corporal Pun,
from Nepal, and wounding four other UK soldiers.

Hussein,
an intelligence officer, returned to the Afghan living quarters within 
the base, telling his commander: ‘Look out, the Taliban are attacking 
the ISAF.’ He then fled the base.

Lt Col Strickland told the inquest that he stopped Afghan forces from hunting down Hussein.

He said: ‘They were horrified. They were as surprised as we were and wanted to do anything to resolve the issue.’

Lt Col Strickland said there was no evidence that Hussein was either a Taliban infiltrator or high on drugs.

The inquest continues.
