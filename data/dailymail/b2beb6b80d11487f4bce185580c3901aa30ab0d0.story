Stress: Former aides say Bachmann may not be able to handle the stress of the campaign alone

Rep. Michele Bachmann suffers debilitating pain episodes that have landed her in hospital and call into question whether she could withstand the rigours of a campaign and the stress of serving as president.

Former aides of the Tea Party darling claim that she becomes 'incapacitated' by the stress-induced episodes that she has characterized as severe headaches.

The Daily Caller website, who quotes three former aides, said that on at least three occasions, Bachmann has landed in hospital as a result of these episodes.

But Bachmann released a statement today admitting that she suffers from migraines 'like nearly 30 million other Americans' but vehemently denied that they have ever caused her to function ineffectively.

When repeatedly questioned about the migraines at a press conference today, the 55-year-old ignored the journalist, who is then said to have been 'roughed up' by her security guards.

In late July 2010, her communications
director Dave Dziok told his boss that he planned to take a new job 
with a public relations firm.

Dziok had worked for Bachmann for two-and-a-half years and was leaving on good terms.

Staff turnover can frustrate any employer, but Bachmann responded more dramatically.

Dziok’s
departure triggered a debilitating medical episode that landed the 
congresswoman in urgent care, the Daily Caller reports.

A former aide said: 'Within 24 hours she was in the hospital.

Mrs Bachmann was admitted to a Washington D.C. hospital on Friday, July 30, and released that same day.

She flew home to Minnesota to recuperate, missing a scheduled campaign event.

Without specifying why Mrs Bachmann had been hospitalized, Mr Dziok said at the time: 'It’s nothing folks should worry about going forward.'

It was, according to the Daily Caller's three sources, not an isolated event.

The Minnesota Republican's stress-induced episodes occur once a week on average and can 'incapacitate' her for days at a time, they say.

But in a statement released today, the presidential candidate said: 'Let me be abundantly clear - my ability to function effectively has never been impeded by migraines and will not affect my ability to serve as Commander in Chief.

'As a presidential candidate and office holder, I am focused on performing my job, which has never been more important given the state of our economy and the millions of Americans that are out of work.

'While I appreciate the concern for me and my health, the greater concern should be the debate that is occurring in Washington over whether or not we will increase our debt, spending and taxes.'

At a rally in South Carolina earlier, ABC investigative reporter Brian Ross repeatedly asked her whether her migraines ever made her miss a House vote.

When she refused to answer, he dashed after her and followed her into a parking area where her SUV was waiting.

When Bachmann's bodyguards spotted him they 'pounced on him, grabbing and pushing him multiple times with what looked like unusual force' according to Time's reporter Michael Crowley who said he witnessed the event.

Mr Crowley said: 'I have never seen a reporter treated so roughly at a campaign event, especially not a presidential one.'

Another adviser to Bachmann, who was involved in her 2010 congressional campaign, said of her headaches: 'She has terrible migraine headaches. And they put her out of commission for a day or more at a time. They come out of nowhere, and they’re unpredictable.

'They level her. They put her down. It’s actually sad. It’s very painful.'

Some close to Mrs Bachmann fear she won’t be to handle to the stress of the campaign, let alone the presidency.

The adviser said: 'When she gets ‘em, frankly, she can’t function at all. It’s not like a little thing with a couple Advils. It’s bad.

'The migraines are so bad and so intense, she carries and takes all sorts of pills.

'Prevention pills. Pills during the migraine. Pills after the migraine, to keep them under control. She has to take these pills wherever she goes.'

To staff, Mrs Bachmann has implausibly blamed the headaches on uncomfortable high-heel shoes, but those who have worked closely with her cite stress, a busy schedule and anything going badly for Mrs Bachmann as causes.

On the evening of May 13, 2010, Mrs Bachmann flew to Los Angeles for a series of political and fundraising events.

In part because of complications with her flight schedule, Mrs Bachmann’s mood plunged.

During the entire six-hour flight, she was sick from headaches.

Her husband Marcus Bachmann met her at the airport and took her to a nearby urgent care centre.

Though Mrs Bachmann managed to attend several events in California, but she struggled through the weekend and was in pain throughout, according to a source.

On October 19, 2010, Mrs Bachmann fell apart at a Greenwich, Conn., fundraiser at the home of Craig Stevenson, CEO of Diamond S Shipping.

She was put in a bed at Stevenson’s home and later checked into an urgent care facility near LaGuardia Airport, the source said.

Back in February 2006, Mrs Bachmann checked into a hospital for what a press release called 'an appendicitis attack,' according to an archive of her website.

'Michele felt very well immediately after the surgery but then suffered from complications, including nausea and intense migraines,' the press release reads.

Of particular concern to some around her is the significant amount of medication Bachmann allegedly takes to address her condition.

The former aide alleges that Bachmann’s congressional staff is 'constantly' in contact with her doctors to tweak the types and amounts of medicine she is taking.

Marcus Bachmann helps her manage the episodes.

The sources spoke out because they're terrified about the impact the condition could have on Mr Bachmann’s performance if she actually became president, the website says.

They also worry that the issue could blow up in the general election campaign, giving President Obama an easy path to re-election.

Mrs Bachmann's released

Miss Stewart refused to discuss Bachmann's medical history in detail.

But she says Bachmann has been campaigning intensely for more than a month in 'stressful, hot' conditions without incident.

Miss Stewart says Mrs Bachmann's migraines are treated successfully with medication.
