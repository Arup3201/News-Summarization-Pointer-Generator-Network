When next season’s fixtures are released in June there is a strong possibility that neither Bournemouth or Millwall will be in the casting their eyes towards the Championship.

Eddie Howe’s side recorded their fifth win in a row to extend their unbeaten run to 14 games as they look set for promotion in May.

But Millwall could well be heading in the opposite direction after falling to their fourth successive home defeat to leave them hovering nervously above the relegation zone.

In reality this game was over and the points heading back to the South Coast before half time after goals from Yann Kermorgan and Harry Arter put Bournemouth in a commanding position at the break.

It would have been understandable if the travelling fans had been a little nervous having thrown away a 2-0 half time lead to the same side a month ago.

But there was to be no mistake this time and Bournemouth manager Howe was pleased his side learnt from their mistakes.

Howe said: ‘It was a big win for us. Whenever you come to Millwall you know it’s going to be difficult. It was very hostile and we dealt with that challenge well.

‘I didn’t feel we were ever under pressure. The goals came at good times and we took them both well.

‘We needed to learn from the previous game (in November). Second half we were professional and without being at our very best it was a comfortable win.’ 

Bournemouth stamped their authority on the game and took the lead just after the half hour mark when Lee Martin brought down Charlie Daniels on the edge of the area and referee David Coote had no hesitation in pointing to the spot - despite protests from the Millwall players that the foul happened outside the box.

Kermorgant stepped up and put Bournemouth ahead despite the best efforts of David Forde.

And Millwall were cursing their luck again 10 minutes later when Callum Wilson broke free of the offside trap and played a low cross which found Arter, who took his chance to shoot at the second attempt on the turn to double Bournemouth’s lead and score his fifth goal in five league games.

Holloway tried to change things again in the second half throwing on veteran striker Ricardo Fuller, but Bournemouth were professional without being spectacular and kept the ball well.

The game was up 10 minutes from time when Millwall were reduced to 10 men after Shaun Williams was shown a straight red card for an apparent stamp on Wilson after the Bournemouth man had fouled him.

The win extends Bournemouth’s lead at the top of the table to four points but Howe is keeping his feet firmly on the ground.

Howe added: ‘After finishing 10th last season we hoped to be in and around the top six but we are very pleased where we are.’

At the final whistle the cheers of the travelling supporters were drowned out by the boos from the home fans and pressure is certainly mounting on Holloway.

The Millwall manager said: ‘For the first goal I expected a free-kick to be given, not a penalty.

‘You’ve got to be 100 per cent sure, but the referee is 200 per cent wrong because it was outside the box.

‘I felt we deserved more than we got out there and a lack of confidence and spread quickly and we need to stop the rot because we want to stay in this division.’
