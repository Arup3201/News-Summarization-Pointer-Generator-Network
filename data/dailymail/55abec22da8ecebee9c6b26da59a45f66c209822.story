A man who ordered a sausage biscuit from McDonald's almost bit off more than he would have liked after discovering the snack had already been half-eaten.

Don Richardson was on his way to a football game to see Mississippi State play Texas A&M and was about to take a bite out of what he thought was a sausage biscuit when he discovered someone else had beaten him to it. 

His biscuit was actually an English muffin, buttered and covered in jelly, but worse was the fact someone had already taken several bites taken out of it.

Unwanted surprise: Don Richardson ordered a sausage biscuit but what he received was an English muffin, buttered and covered in jelly — with several bites taken out of it

'I was driving, hurrying  and nearly bit into it before I looked down and saw it,' said Mr Richardson to the Clarion Ledger. 

'Marie (his wife) wanted me to take it back, but we were already several miles down the road by then and didn't want to miss kickoff.'

Mr Richardson made a number of phone calls to the fast food giant and even went back to the same McDonald's store to tell them about his unwelcome surprise, however so far he has not heard anything from the chain.

'I still haven't gotten as much as a 'We're sorry this happened' or 'We'll check the videotape and see how this happened.' They act like they don't care that I received an order that somebody else — I'm assuming one of their employees — had been eating.'

Mr Richardson bought the offending items at the McDonald's at 1806 Spillway Road at the Reservoir in Rankin County as he was on on his way to see Mississippi State play Texas A&M. He says he just wants an apology

McDonald's reported Tuesday its profits dropped 30 percent over the last quarter from a year ago, from $1.52 billion to $1.07 billion.

It would appear that after this latest debacle McDonald's has lost at least one more customer. 

Richardson said he is upset about the situation because he was worried the person who ate the muffin before him may have had some sort of disease.

'I talked with a very nice young lady at the register, but the manager was no help whatsoever,' he said. 'She told me she couldn't replace my order because they were 'now on the lunch menu.' I told her I didn't want it replaced, I wanted an explanation. 

She then told me if I didn't get out of her line they would call 911. There wasn't even a line to get out of. She was rude and never even offered an 'I'm sorry.' I was astounded.' 

'I'm not out to get McDonald's, I'm not out to sue them. But I would like an apology. And I would like for them to care enough to go back and look at the videotape and try to find out how it happened so that it doesn't happen to somebody else. And then call me and tell me what happened. They have my number.'
