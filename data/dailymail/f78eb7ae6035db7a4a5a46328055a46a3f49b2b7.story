These are the shocking injuries suffered by a woman who was beaten by her husband after they were captured on a police body camera worn by a officer responding to her 999 call.

Police were called to Dawn Marmoy's home on the Isle of Wight in October last year after reports she was being attacked by her husband Michael Gregory.

The two responding officers were both wearing Body-Worn Video (BWV) cameras, which filmed Ms Marmoy's bruised and swollen face, which one officer described as the worst they had ever seen.  

The images captured on a police officer's body worn video camera showing the shocking injuries suffered by Dawn Marmoy after she was beaten by her husband Michael Gregory 

The pictures show Ms Marmoy after she was attacked and when police came to her home in the Isle of Wight after she dialled 999 

Ms Marmoy's face was left bruised and swollen following the attack and the footage shows how she was left in pain 

In the footage, which has been released by Hampshire Police, the two officers can be seen knocking on the front door, which is opened by Gregory.

As a dog barks loudly in the background, one of the officers ask Gregory if they can speak to his wife.

At first the 77-year-old is reluctant to let them in, saying 'who called you?'

But after eventually letting the officers into the home, the footage then shows a confused Ms Marmoy, aged 60, who has bruising around both eyes and swollen cheeks.

She can then be seen sitting in an armchair holding a cup wincing in pain from her injuries.

Gregory was then arrested and in May of this year pleaded guilty to assault and jailed at Portsmouth Crown Court.

Now the footage showing the night of the attack has been released with the consent of Ms Marmoy, who is urging other sufferers of domestic violence to speak up.

When officers first turned up at the couple's house in the Isle of Wight, Gregory answered the door and at first appeared reluctant to let the constables inside 

Gregory eventually relented, and the officers discovered Ms Marmoy and her injuries. Gregory has since been convicted of assault at Portsmouth Crown Court 

She said: 'You’ve got a life, and you deserve that life. These people make you feel worthless, completely useless; that’s not true.

'They deserve the punishment, you don’t, but until you tell someone, or say it’s "got to stop", it will carry on. Do what you’ve got to do, but do it sooner than I did it.

'The last time he was punching me, I thought "this is it", you’re going to die tonight.

'I was thinking of my children, my grandchildren. He just meant to do me harm, which he did, but I didn’t realise how much harm, I was terrified.

'They could see the emotion of how frightened I was. If they (police) had left that night and that camera wasn’t on, and it had been a little bit later, they wouldn’t have found me as they did, they would have found a body.'

She also appeared on the BBC Panorama programme earlier this week, where she spoke about her experiences.  

Police are now praising Ms Marmoy for speaking about her injuries and say the case highlights how usefel BWV cameras can be.

Ms Marmoy pictured now, has allowed Hampshire Police to release the footage of the night she was attacked in a bid to urge other survivors of domestic abuse to speak out 

Detective Superintendent Ben Snuggs said: 'The effects of domestic abuse can be profound and persistent for the survivors, their families and the wider community.

'We have the utmost respect and admiration for Dawn Marmoy and her decision to speak out and give strength to encourage other victims not to suffer in silence.

'Hampshire Constabulary is dedicated to supporting survivors like Dawn to ensure they have trust and confidence in reporting their experiences to police.

'This case provides a graphic insight into the power of Body-Worn Video (BWV) as an independent witness that captures crucial early evidence in an investigation.'
