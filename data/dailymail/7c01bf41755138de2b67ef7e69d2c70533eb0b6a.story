A former Christian radio host was called a 'wolf in sheep's clothing' on Thursday as he was sentenced to 40 years for raping an 11-year-old boy.

John Balyo, 36, of Caledonia, Michigan, was arrested in a June as part of a sex trafficking ring bust, and in September, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing the child in a hotel room. 

At the sentencing hearing, Judge Robert Holmes Bell said it was difficult to reconcile Balyo's public image as a newlywed expectant father, who was a camp counselor and missionary volunteer, with that of the sadistic pedophile which came to light in the police investigation.

Police found Balyo's lock-up where he stashed child pornography and practised a sexual kidnapping fantasy with a child-sized mannequin.

According to court records, reported by freep.com, Balyo also kept naked photos of victims, children's obituaries and articles on the infamous BTK (Bind, Torture, Kill) serial killer.

The Christian DJ also kept news articles about the death, torture and sexual abuse of children. 

A piece of notebook paper was found which contained boys' names and phrases like swimming, photo shoot, sleeping/napping, strapped down, boy/cub scout, headlock, abuse and swim lessons. 

He also had a bondage kit of rolls of duct tape, four pairs of handcuffs, parachute cord, nylon rope, 107 zip ties, a set of rubber gloves, two lengths of 18-inch chain and a padlock.

Balyo's 40-year sentence was on top of the 25 years handed down last month in Calhoun County for first-degree criminal sexual conduct.

The 36-year-old raped the 11-year-old boy in a Battle Creek motel in May - two weeks after his wedding. 

In August, Balyo pleaded guilty to photographing sex acts with the 11-year-old in May after paying him, then handcuffing the child to a bed. 

His wife, who is due to give birth to the couple's child in February, was granted a divorce last month. She was granted full custody of the child.  

In a sentencing statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tessa K. Hessmiller wrote: 'No one ever reported any misgivings or indiscretions about Balyo. But he was a wolf in sheep's clothing.

'But underneath the surface, he was feeding a morbid and sadistic fascination with children, creating and accumulating pedophilic materials, rehearsing a sexual kidnapping fantasy with a gun and a child-sized mannequin and meeting clandestinely in hotel rooms with young boys in bondage.

'Balyo's three meetings with (victim 1) resulted in sexual exploitation and degradation of a child in the most depraved ways.'

If he lives long enough to be released from prison, Balyo will be required to register as a sex offender and wear an electronic monitor for the rest of his life, Battle Creek Inquirer reported. 

In court last month, Balyo apologized to his 11-year-old victim.

He said: 'I just want to take this opportunity to say I am feeling very deep and constant remorse for my actions.

'And I want the family to know I am very sorry and wish I could do something to correct what has been done.'

Balyo added: 'I did take images of a child and they were sexually explicit involving bondage and nudity. I performed sex acts as described. I knew it was wrong.'

The victim's mother wrote in an impact statement, which was read in court during the sentencing hearing, saying that children should be loved and respected, not 'used and abused' by adults.

'No child should be scared of people or of life itself,' the woman stated. 'I think you should sit and rot in jail the rest of your miserable life.'

Balyo, a host at WCSG, was arrested in June at the Big Ticket Christian music festival in Gaylord, Michigan.

He admitted at the time that he had a rented storage unit where he kept a 'bondage kit', a federal spokesman confirmed to MailOnline. Handcuffs and other items were found in a suitcase after police searched a storage unit in Plainfield Township. 

Balyo paid another man, 41-year-old Ronald Moser, to arrange a sex session with a minor for him through a child sex trafficking website he ran.   

According to Mlive.com, in a photo album posted online by Moser, there were ten images of a young boy lying face down on a bed.

His hands and feet were bound and he was wearing only underwear, which had been rolled up to show his buttocks, according to a federal agent.

The albums had titles such as 'very cute boy,' and 'sexy boys', police said.

The FBI said Moser put images online and planned to trade in child porn. It is alleged that Moser ran a website providing sex with underage boys for money.

The investigation into the alleged pedophiles has involved multiple agencies as part of a larger 'Operation Predator'.
