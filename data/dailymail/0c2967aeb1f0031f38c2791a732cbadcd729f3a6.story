Scientists claim to have shed  light on how dinosaurs divided up their meals allowing them to co-exist in harsh prehistoric ecosystems.

Large, long-necked plant-eating dinosaurs, such as Diplodocus, dominated the land between 210 million and 65 million years ago and would have need huge amounts of food.

These sauropods were the largest land animals of all time, with the biggest weighing 80 tonnes - more than 11 elephants.

By analysing dinosaur skulls, scientists claim to have shed light on how dinosaurs divided up their meals allowing them to co-exist in harsh prehistoric ecosystems. Pictured is a completed skull model of the Late Jurassic North American sauropod dinosaur Camarasaurus

Researchers from the University of Bristol and the Natural History Museum in London believe that multiple sauropod species survived in the same habitats because of their different diets.

The Late Jurassic Morrison Formation - a distinctive sequence of sedimentary rock in the western United States - contained more than 10 species of sauropod.

In comparison,the highly diverse faunas seen in modern Africa only support one gigantic species, the elephant.

Experts studied a digital reconstruction of the skulls, jaws and neck muscles of the sauropods Camarasaurus and Diplodocus to investigate how they fed.

David Button, a PhD student at Bristol's School of Earth Sciences, said: 'Our results show that although neither could chew, the skulls of both dinosaurs were sophisticated cropping tools.

'Camarasaurus had a robust skull and strong bite, which would have allowed it to feed on tough leaves and branches.

'Meanwhile, the weaker bite and more delicate skull of Diplodocus would have restricted it to softer foods like ferns. 

Its fossilised right shinbone (right) and left hipbone (bottom) were found together and analysis showed the animal was different to other species found

A primitive meat-eating dinosaur that roamed the Earth about 200 million years ago has been dug up in South America.

The new species, about the size of a lion and found high up in the Venezuelan Andes, was an ancestor of Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus.

More than 6ft (1.8 metres) long, it is one of the few dinosaurs ever recovered from northern South America, and the first carnivorous member of the group discovered in Venezuela.

At the time all the planet’s landmass was wrapped up in one supercontinent Pangaea surrounded by a giant ocean and was just beginning to break up into the modern continents we now see today.

Named Tachiraptor admirabilis after Tachira state where it was unearthed, it was a predator theropod but would probably have snacked on the abundant ferns as well.

Tachiraptor was around at the beginning of the period known geologically as the Jurassic, and helps explain the spread of carvivorous dinosaurs following the Triassic mass extinction shortly before.

Half the world’s animals were mysteriously wiped out by either climate change, volcanic eruptions or an asteroid impact.

Its fossilised right shinbone and left hipbone were found together and analysis showed the animal was different to other species found, the study published in the journal Royal Society Open Science said.

'However, Diplodocus could also have used its strong neck muscles to help it detach plant material through movements of the head. 

'This indicates differences in diet between the two dinosaurs, which would have allowed them to co-exist.'

The researchers also used a series of biomechanical measurements from other sauropod species to calculate the difference in movement in their skulls and jaws. 

They found that other Morrison Formation sauropods were also highly varied in feeding adaptations, which suggests they had different diets.

Professor Emily Rayfield of the University of Bristol, co-author of the report, said: 'In modern animal communities differences in diet such as this - termed dietary niche partitioning - allow multiple similar species to co-exist by reducing competition for food.

'Although dietary niche partitioning has been suspected between Morrison Formation sauropods based on their structural features and patterns of tooth-wear, this is the first study to provide strong, numerical, biomechanical evidence for its presence in this fossil community.'

Co-author Professor Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum added: 'Our study provides insight not only into the ecology of dinosaurs but more generally into the mechanisms supporting species-richness in other animal communities, both from the fossil record and in the present day.'

The research, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council, was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
