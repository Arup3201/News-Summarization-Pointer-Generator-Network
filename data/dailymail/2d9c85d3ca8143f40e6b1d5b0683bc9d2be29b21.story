The next leader of Britain? Mayor Boris Johnson 
seen at the London Studios this morning prior to his appearance on ITV's
morning programme Daybreak

Boris Johnson has dismissed talk of him becoming the next prime minister, joking: 'How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire?'

The London mayor was repeatedly asked in an interview if he would like to be the next prime minister but dismissed speculation as a 'silly season' story.

He was shown footage of him stuck last week on a 150ft high, 1,000ft long zip wire at the London Live event in Victoria Park, east London, when he was left dangling over a crowd of people after losing momentum.

'There you have got it,' he said. 'How on earth could you elect that guy? How could anybody elect a prat who gets stuck in a zip wire?'

'I tell you what happened, I was trying to publicise our live site in Victoria Park, which is a wonderful place, by the way.'

Speaking on ITV Daybreak, he added that the experience had been 'slightly scarier' than it appeared, joking that his actions had been 'heroic'.

'After I got stuck on that thing, we did have a big increase in the number of visitors, so it wasn’t totally fatuous, contrary to appearances,' he said.

Asked by presenter Kate Garraway if he fancied being prime minister, he responded: 'No, of course not, because I have got four years of mayor of London ahead ... perhaps this is the moment to knock this once and for all on the head?'

'I am mayor of London and my cup runs over, and plus ... we have got the Paralympics and they are going to be fantastic too.'

Speculation has been rife that Mr Johnson is positioning himself to replace David Cameron in the Tory top spot before the next General Election in 2015.

Although he has publicly denied any ambition to lead the Conservatives, sources close to the London mayor say he is determined to succeed Mr Cameron.

It emerged on Monday that Mr Johnson will embark on an ambitious 'world tour' to capitalise on his Olympic popularity, which has only increased speculation as to his ambitions.

The London Mayor is hoping to capitalise on the so-called ‘Boris Bounce’ with a series of overseas trips to India, the Middle East, Brazil and China.

The official purpose of the trip will be to drum up trade for the capital, but senior Tories believe he is aiming to boost his image as an international statesman.

On your way to Number 10? Speculation has been 
rife that Mr Johnson is positioning himself to replace David Cameron in 
the Tory top spot before the next General Election in 2015

A number of Tory MPs are understood to be happy to stand aside to give him a safe Westminster seat and influential backbenchers like Nadine Dorries have said he is the party's only hope of avoiding electoral oblivion.

'On our present trajectory, the Conservatives are facing electoral oblivion under Mr Cameron,' Ms Dorries said.

'We are going to have our backsides metaphorically kicked in next year’s county council elections, we will suffer big losses to UKIP in the 2014 Euro elections and the year after that we face the prospect of defeat  in the General Election.'

She added: 'As last week’s events have shown, Boris has an appeal and charisma that David Cameron lacks. Which other political leader could get stuck dangling from a zip wire and come out of it smelling of roses?'

Today Mr Cameron, in an interview with London talk radio station LBC, dodged the question of whether his rival might make a good job leading the country.

‘I think that London is lucky to have him as mayor. He’s done a great job,' Mr Cameron said. ‘He got a huge amount to offer the country, but he’s got a term to serve as Mayor of London.

‘I have seen him every day during the Olympics and we work together extremely well.’

Worried, David? Mr Cameron appeared to dodge the question of whether Mr Johnson would make a good PM in an interview with LBC this morning

When asked whether he would want to share a rowing boat with either Boris or Nick Clegg he said: ‘For weight and strength you would go for Boris.

‘We are in the building where the rumble in the lift took place so we know he has it when he needs it.’ The PM was referring to Mr Johnson's furious spat with London mayoral rival Ken Livingstone following a joint radio interview earlier this year.

In an apparent attempt to head off a potential challenge by Mr Johnson, friends of Mr Cameron have insisted that the London mayor can never take the Tory top job because of his colourful private life and buffoonery.

One source said: ‘It is one thing for Boris to be London Mayor, but quite another to be Prime Minister.

'All the stuff in his private life would be in the media and people would not like it.

'They just won’t put up with that kind of thing from a Prime Minister.’

According to Tory aides, No 10 was irritated by Mr Johnson’s refusal to tell them which Olympic events he was to attend, risking an unforeseen situation where he and the PM were at the same event.

Friction between the two rivals was heightened by an opinion poll that suggested the Tories would have a better chance of winning the next General Election if Mr Cameron was replaced by Mr Johnson.

There are signs that Mr Johnson's colourful private life - which have earned him the moniker 'Bonking Boris' - may not be the handicap that Mr Cameron's cronies suggest.

Former Tory leader Michael Howard said over the weekend that he blundered when he fired  Mr Johnson as a frontbencher after his affair with writer Petronella Wyatt was revealed in 2004.

‘I think I was wrong to sack him, it is something I regret,’ Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4’s Profile in an episode on Mr Johnson.

Asked if the scandal had damaged Mr Johnson, Lord Howard said: ‘I am not entirely sure that it had any lasting effect because Boris is his own man and does what he thinks appropriate at whatever time and whatever situation he is in.’

Leading Tory donors have also thrown their weight behind Mr Johnson. Financier Peter Hall, who has given 
more than £450,000 to the Conservatives, told the Sunday Times that Mr 
Johnson could be the right leader for Britain if the country sinks into a
very deep recession.

'Boris's
great strength is his confidence and his optimism and his ability to, 
in an almost Churchillian way, inspire people to hope for a better 
future,' said Mr Hall.

However, Mr Johnson and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt have faced questions about their judgment after both were pictured with Rupert Murdoch at the Olympics.

Error of judgement? Mr Johnson sits next to media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his wife Wendy Deng to watch Rebecca Adlington swim in the 800m final at the Aquatics Centre last week

The mayor was criticised for inviting
the media mogul to watch the swimming with him last Friday. And Mr Hunt
was filmed smiling and shaking hands with Mr Murdoch at the Aquatics 
Centre on the same night.

Mr
Johnson has reportedly discussed with Mr Murdoch whether Mr Cameron 
will lead the Tories into the next Election. Critics said both men 
should have avoided contact with Mr Murdoch because of the investigation
into phone-hacking at the News of the World.

On Daybreak this morning, Mr Johnson insisted that the long-term economic benefit of the Olympics to London was 'massive'.

'Around the world people are looking at pictures of London. They are seeing a happy city, a city of fantastic places to visit and they are going to want to invest in this city,' he said.

'The long-term economic benefit is massive.'

He added that one of the most moving aspects of the Olympics had been the number of people who volunteered to help.

He said: 'They are doing stuff in their own free time. Wouldn’t it be a wonderful thing if we could mobilise them, and people who want to join them, through Team London to help with sport in schools?

'It is often not the shortage of facilities, the problem is a shortage of people who have got the CRB checks and all that stuff who are willing to come and help out.'
