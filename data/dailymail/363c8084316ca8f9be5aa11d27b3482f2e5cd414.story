They had smiled and posed for photographs on the red carpet and then enjoyed an animated conversation with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

And if Zindzi and Zenani Mandela had any idea that their father's long life was drawing to a close, they did not betray it for a minute.

Then, in a single instance, everything changed. As they were about to watch the London premiere of his incredible story, the sisters were apparently told that the 95-year-old had died peacefully at home after months of illness.

Tearful and flustered, they tried to compose themselves. The two women were said to have left the cinema immediately, but when asked if they wanted the film - Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom - to continue, they said yes.

It was an extraordinary premiere. Few in the Odeon auditorium in Leicester Square knew what had happened and settled down to enjoy an evening celebrating one of the most iconic figures of the 20th century.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were informed of his death discreetly by an aide shortly before the end of the movie.

The Queen today expressed her shock at
 the timing of Mr Mandela's death, saying: 'It was extraordinary because
 William and Catherine were at the film.

'They
 were clapping like mad and somebody came on and said, "can you just 
listen please, we have just heard he has died". It is amazing isn’t it. 
During the first night of his film.'

Visit: The Queen is shown a plaque dedicated to Mandela by John Bercow today where she revealed William and Kate were 'clapping like mad' at the end of Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom when they were informed the first black president of South Africa had passed away

It
 was only after the credits had rolled that the film's producer Anant 
Singh got on the stage to break the news to the rest of the audience. 
There were screams and gasps of shock while some burst into tears. A two
 minutes' silence was held.

Eleanor

 Simmonds, 54, from Croydon, who was at the premiere to support a 
Mandela charity, said: 'There was an audible sharp intake of breath. It 
was shocking news to hear at the end of the film. Everyone was shocked,'
 she said. 'I was really, really sad news because it was a wonderful 
evening.'

William
 and Kate looked ashen-faced as they walked down the stairs into the 
foyer. Speaking as he left the Odeon cinema, the Duke said: 'I just wanted to say it's 
extremely sad and tragic news. We were just reminded what an extraordinary and inspiring man Nelson Mandela was.

'My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. It's very sad.'

Shortly after the Royal couple left, shocked members of the audience began 
emerging from the cinema, in silence at first.

The cast, whose after-show party was promptly cancelled, 
were too upset to speak. In the foyer, security men surrounded Naomie 
Harris, who plays his wife, Winnie, as she walked slowly past, head down
 and close to tears.

In a statement 
Idris Elba, who is tipped for an Oscar for his portrayal of the great 
man, said in a statement: 'What an honour it was to step into the shoes 
of Nelson Mandela and portray a man who defied odds, broke down 
barriers, and championed human rights before the eyes of the world. My 
thoughts and prayers are with his family.'

Family affair: Nelson Mandela's daughter Zindzi Mandela on the red carpet at the Royal film performance of Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom

Zindzi took her seat alongside royalty, celebrities and fans of the former South African president in London's Leicester Square having revealed on the red carpet beforehand that she was 'hoping to see more of him'

John Battersby, 65, a South African journalist 
who knew Mandela personally and wrote the afterword to his authorised 
biography said: 'My daughter told me just before the announcement. Apparently he died half an hour before the film started.

'My
 phone was buzzing in my pocket but I just thought "who is calling me in
 the Mandela premiere?" In the protection of the darkness I shed a few 
tears.

'He was brilliantly portrayed in the film, what came through was the dignity.'

His daughter Anna said: 'I think it's very fitting that we were all here paying tribute to him at the moment of his passing.'

It was not clear what had happened to Mandela's daughter, Zindzi, but she did not leave with the rest of the audience.

Earlier in the evening she had appeared jovial and relaxed as she walked the red carpet.

Speaking before the showing, she said: 'My father is fine. He's 95 years old and he is pretty frail. We are hoping to see more of him.'

'(The film) is something that makes me feel really proud, what 
my family went through and the role my father played has been 
recognised. It is a reward (for him).

'When we document our history 
in this manner we do it not just for ourselves but also for the future 
generations, young people that my father is really passionate about.

'He has seen clips of the film and said he saw [Idris] that he thought it was him.'

She
 added: 'When my 11 year-old grandson saw the movie last week I asked 
him what did he thought and he said 'the dude who played grandad when he
 talks he kind of reminds me of him'.

'I said: "What about the lady who play big mammy [Winnie Mandela]?" He said: "That chick, I think she's hot!"'

Stopping the screening was discussed after she was informed of her father's death, but Mandela's daughters asked that the film continue, a spokesman with the production said last night.

'His two youngest daughters were told of their father's death during the screening and immediately left the cinema', a statement from the Nelson Mandela Foundation said.

Mandela's death was announced as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sat down to watch the screening of Long Walk To Freedom 

The death of former South African president Nelson Mandela was announced during the UK premiere of a film about his life

Starring British actor Idris Elba, 
'Mandela' follows the iconic anti-apartheid leader’s extraordinary life 
from childhood through to his 27-year imprisonment on Robben Island and,
 finally, his inauguration as the first democratically elected President
 of South Africa in 1994.

The
 film itself, which has been 16 years in the making, has received mixed 
reviews from critics, but Elba, who is best known for his role as a 
detective chief inspector in the hit TV series Luther, has been praised 
as ‘towering’ and ‘Oscar-worthy’.

Speaking
 on the red carpet last night he told Mail Online: 'Everyone knows who 
Mandela is, everyone has an idea of what he sounds and looks like. I 
worked really hard to pull in all the elements, from the sound of his 
voice to the way he walks.

'I
 don't look anything like him but it was really important the audience 
got a sense of who Mandela is because the likelihood is that we will 
never meet him in person.

'For somone who doesn't look like Mandela you have got to work harder to get the audience in there.

'I
 think he [Mandela] has seen parts of the film but ultimately it's about
 his life, he's been there, he's done it - so he might not even need to 
see it.

'Tonight is 
extra special because this is my country and when the royals come out to
 watch a film it's. a big deal. I feel very proud that it's my film, 
really proud.'

On
 Wednesday his daughter, Makaziwe Mandela, insisted he was ‘still with 
us, strong, courageous’ but admitted for the first time that he was on 
his 'deathbed’.

'Even 
for a lack of a better word... on his deathbed he is teaching us lessons
 - lessons in patience, in love, lessons of tolerance,’ she added.

'Every moment I get with him I'm amazed.

'There
 are times where I have to pinch myself that I come from this man who is
 a fighter even though you can see he is struggling, but the fighting 
spirit is still there with him.'

Each year the Royal Film Performance 
is staged to raise funds for the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund, 
which supports industry employees and their families in times of 
hardship.

Also 
benefitting from this year’s event is The Nelson Mandela Children’s 
Fund, which works with the disadvantaged youth of South Africa.
