For a man who had just made it to the Champions League quarter-finals and broken the record for goals scored in European competition, Cristiano Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure as he left the pitch shaking his head on Tuesday.

The mood of the world's best player hadn't changed when he emerged from the home-team dressing room and told waiting television crews that he would not be talking again publicly until the end of the season.

The significance of 'the end of the season' is that by then we will know just how much a campaign that promised so much for Real Madrid has delivered.

Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates after scoring, but he couldn't prevent his side slumping to a 4-3 defeat

Much more will also be known about the futures of Ronaldo - Real Madrid's top scorer — and also his team-mate Gareth Bale and his coach Carlo Ancelotti. Supporters at the Bernabeu turned on Ancelotti even before Real's 4-3 defeat by Schalke had started, with the manager's name jeered as it was announced before kick-off.

Bale was whistled at in the second half while goalkeeper Iker Casillas also bore the brunt of the discontent, more justifiably because he could have done more about Schalke's first two goals. When Casillas, as captain, summoned his team-mates into the centre-circle at the final whistle they went reluctant — Ronaldo more than most — but were met with more resounding boos and a show of white handkerchief protest.

Casillas has said he wants to stay until he is 40 but Real want Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea, and every day that passes without him signing a new deal at Old Trafford leads them to believe they still have a chance.

United will be watching the potential unravelling of Real's season closely.

The campaign could still end gloriously if important injured players like Sergio Ramos, James Rodriguez and the fit-again Luka Modric return to their best ahead of the Champions League latter rounds. But what if things don't end well?

United have made little secret of wanting Bale at the end of this campaign. He is happy in Spain but how many times can a player have his first mistake verbally chastised by his own fans before he starts to wonder if he might not be better off elsewhere?

The former Tottenham star is not a particularly social animal and has not put down any great emotional roots in the city. United must be encouraged by the fact that despite him winning four trophies in his first year at the club, supporters are doing nothing to cultivate a lasting bond.

United have also considered the impact that recapturing Ronaldo would create. And they were interested in Ancelotti before they turned to Louis van Gaal to replace David Moyes.

The Italian stayed at Madrid and won his third Champions League but he is now drawn to the idea of an English return and the wheels have been set in motion to push his profile in England – not that anyone needs reminding how well he did at Chelsea.

No-one at Madrid is suggesting Ronaldo, Bale and Ancelotti all park up at Old Trafford this summer with De Gea moving the other way but there is a sense that there will be an overhaul at the end of the season and with instability prevailing it might not just be squad players such as Alvaro Arbeloa, Fabio Coentrao, Asier Illaramendi and Sami Khedira who leave.

At any club such rumblings would be dismissed as ridiculous but the knee-jerk short-termism at Madrid is nothing new.

An online poll asking which striker should be dropped from the 'BBC' front three of Benzema, Bale and Cristiano (the one that was 'the best in the world' just three months ago) was carried out this week by Diario AS. Bale registered 40 per cent and Ronaldo 33 per cent. Ancelotti sticks up for both but no one sticks up for him.

As he said earlier this week: 'When we win it's got nothing to do with me, when we lose it's my fault.' Post match on Tuesday he was even asked if: 'Knowing the business as he does, would he be surprised if he was sacked after defeat to Schalke?'

He has them in the last eight of the Champions League in spite of an injury crisis; Ronaldo has already scored as many goals this season as last; and Real are only a win in next week's Clasico away from returning to the top of the league but you would never know it from the faces of those who were winning the European Cup just 10 months ago.
