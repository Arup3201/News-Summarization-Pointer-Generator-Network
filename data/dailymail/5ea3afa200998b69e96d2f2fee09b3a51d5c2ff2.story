Gareth Southgate has effectively ruled out selecting Raheem Sterling for this summer’s European Under 21 finals.

England head coach Roy Hodgson said in November that Southgate would have priority when picking his squad for the tournament in June, even though the seniors have a friendly against the Republic of Ireland and a Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia that month.

But Southgate said: ‘Realistically, Raheem has become a very important player for the senior team and for Liverpool. There is a huge demand on him. Part of my role is looking at the development of individuals and I’m not convinced another tournament in the summer would be right for him.

England Under 21 manager Southgate says Sterling doesn't need more tournament experience

‘If he plays another 20 or 30 games before the end of the season, I really can’t see him coming. God forbid, if something was to happen and the dynamic changed, in that he needed games, of course you would look at it. 

'But he has been to the Under 17s World Cup in Mexico and a World Cup last year in Brazil. He’s had tournament experience.

‘Of course he is a super player and, from a selfish point of view, it would be easy to try and grab all of those. But we have to look at the bigger picture.’

Sterling has featured 34 times already for club and country so far this season

Sterling last played for the Under 21s in a 9-0 win over San Marino in November 2013.

But while Southgate, who on Thursday signed a 12-month contract extension, is sure about Sterling, 20, the picture around Ross Barkley is less clear. 

The Everton midfielder won his sole Under 21 cap against Scotland in August 2013 but he could be involved in Euro 2015, particularly if he drops down to the Under 21s for the March friendlies against the Czech Republic and Germany. 

Everton midfielder Ross Barkley's England future remains uncertain

Southgate was at Goodison Park last Saturday to watch John Stones and Barkley in Everton’s 1-1 draw with Manchester City. 

The midfielder’s form has been indifferent and while there is no disputing his talent, he is not playing well enough to be an England regular at the highest level.

‘Ross is interesting as we haven’t had a chance to work with him yet,’ said Southgate. ‘He is someone myself and Roy will talk about. I will also talk to Roberto Martinez, who I get on with very well. The boys who have got us to this point are a tight group and I have to think about the dynamic.’

The FA have been looking to renew Southgate’s terms since England breezed past Croatia in the Euro 2015 play-off last October. He had 18 months left on his contract but this deal now runs until after the 2017 tournament

As yet, though, there is no indication about whether his influential assistant Steve Holland will commit to another qualifying cycle, given his workload with Chelsea.

‘That would be down to him,’ said Southgate. ‘Chelsea have been really good. He has been invaluable to the way we work. But it is a massive commitment and he will look at it at the end of this cycle. He has been huge for me.’
