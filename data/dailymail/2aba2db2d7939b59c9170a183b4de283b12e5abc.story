A Canadian newspaper has released a bombshell report, alleging the family of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was 'once deeply immersed in the illegal drug scene.'

The report in the Globe and Mail published the explosive claims on Saturday, which the family has adamantly denied.

Doug Ford, the mayor's brother who is also a Toronto City Councillor Doug is alleged to have sold hashish in the 1980s, another brother Randy is reported to have been involved in a drug-related kidnapping and Ford's sister Kathy has been alleged to have ties with the KKK.

Denial: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has denied ever using crack cocaine after scandal over an alleged video of him smoking the drug

Scandal: Rob Ford, far right with his wife, has been the object of scrutiny after reports of a video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine

In the article, it alleges the mayor's brother, Toronto City Councillor Doug, sold large quantities of hashish in the 1980s.

There are no records of him ever having been charged in relation to the alleged drug sale.

The article, that cited 10 anonymous sources, also claimed his brother Randy had been charged in a drug-related kidnapping.

Additionally Ford's sister was named as having connections to the KKK and having been involved in drug related violence.

Ford's brother Doug called the newspaper 'little sleaze bags' and 'a bunch of scums' for going after the family.

'I think it's pretty low, and a bunch of sleazy, sleazy journalism. It has gone to the bottom of the barrel â€¦ it makes me sick,' he told a Global News reporter.

Globe's editor-in-chief John Stackhouse defended the piece, telling CBC News that it was 'important to get this on the public record.'

Strain: Rob Ford, with his mother, said at a press conference on Friday that the scandal has taken a toll on his family

The Globe said that it has been 
working on the story for several months and decided to go public after 
Ford's public denial on Friday that he had ever used drugs.

'I
do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine,' Toronto
Mayor Rob Ford said in a press conference Friday afternoon, after a 
week of silence since reports of the video emerged.

'As for a video, I 
cannot comment on a video that I have not seen, or does not exist.'

Reading
from a piece of paper, Ford said the controversy had 'taken a great 
toll on my family and my friends and the great people of Toronto.'

'For
the past week, on the advice of my solicitor, I was advised not to say a
word I want to thank the people of this great city for their outpouring
of support,' he said.

The mayor took no questions and walked away as a reporter asked him whether he had ever used crack cocaine.

The press conference comes on the 
same day that members of his executive committee sent him a letter 
urging him to confront the allegations.

'The
allegations need to be addressed openly and transparently,' the letter 
reads.

'We are encouraging the Mayor to address this matter so that we 
can continue to focus on serving the people of Toronto.'

Reports on the gossip website Gawker
and in the Toronto Star say the video was recorded by men claiming that they had 
sold the drug to Ford.

The Star reported that two 
journalists had watched a video that appears to show Ford, sitting in a 
chair, inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe.

Gawker and the Star said the video was shown to them by a drug dealer who had been trying to sell it for a six-figure sum.

The video has not been released publicly and it's authenticity has not been verified.
