Roy Keane's court appearance has been rearranged at the request of the defence.

The former Manchester United star and current Republic of Ireland coach was due at Trafford Magistrates Court on Tuesday following an allegation that he was at the centre of a road rage rant with a taxi driver at a set of traffic lights. 

But the first hearing will now take place on Wednesday, April 8.

Roy Keane's court appearance for an allegation that he was at the centre of a road rage rant with a taxi driver, has been rearranged at the request of the defence

Keane was with the Ireland squad and manager Martin O'Neill for Sunday night's last-gasp 1-1 Euro 2016 qualifier draw with Poland in Dublin.

Sportsmail understands that the case was put back at the request of the ex-midfielder's representatives.

Keane, who managed Sunderland and Ipswich Town, is not required to attend court, but the postponement suggests that he may intend to do so. 

He was said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade and made obscene gestures after jumping out his Range Rover in Altrincham, Greater Manchester on the morning of January 30.

Taxi driver Fateh Kerar, 44, claims the row last month was sparked when he and his female passenger spotted the TV pundit at a cash machine in nearby Hale.

He says he said 'hello' to the 43-year-old and asked him to 'smile' before Keane got into his car and began following his taxi.

It is then alleged that when the cars stopped at traffic lights an 'angry' Keane, who lives in Bowdon, Cheshire, got out and started acting 'very aggressive'.

Police launched an investigation into the incident and Keane, previously a coach at Aston Villa, was interviewed under caution by officers at a police station earlier this month.

They have now decided to bring him to court.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'A summons was posted on 2 March 2015 for Roy Keane to his home address in Hale to appear before Trafford Magistrates court on 31 March 2015 for a Section 4A Public Order offence.

'This is in relation to an incident on Friday 30 January 2015 when police were called to Ashley Road, Altrincham to a report that a man had behaved aggressively towards another man.'
