Beyonce's little sister Solange is the cover star of the Edit, Net-A-Porter's online magazine

The Edit, weekly and free online at www.net-a-porter.com

Cover: Solange Knowles on a beach, in a J Crew sun dress. Just gorgeous and far less wintry than all those autumn/winter looks on the newsstand glossies.

The fashion: The best aspect of the fashion is you click, you buy. Now. With a selection of bikinis, flats, cover ups and sun dresses.

You can shop vacation beauty products, too (good selection, by the way, including Zelens and Hampton Sun).

Just brilliant, but of course, no High Street doppelgangers - the editor is Lucy Yeomans, who decamped from Harper's Bazaar to here, and it shows

The features: An interview with Solange Knowles. The writer explains to us the meaning of Chic, as in the band.

Thankfully, there is none of that dreadful, boring travel writing you get in the main glossies, just photos and the web site of cool new hotels.

A good idea to get the beauty editor of 
Australian Vogue to advise on skin care in the sun, and advice for Asian
skin. Cutting edge products.

Celebrity mutterings: Solange Knowles: ‘I dropped my phone at Glastonbury and someone gave it back to me later!’

Most useless piece of information: Miranda Kerr uses eyebrow gel.

 

Grazia. Weekly, £1.95

Liz gives her verdict on this week's Grazia magazine

The cover: On the day I am reviewing, it is Kate Middleton. A very busy cover that still manages to have class.

The fashion: Always very good, with new ideas, and always one vastly overpriced shoot to keep advertisers happy. Lots of High Street options. A sense of fun about the trends, too.

The weekly edit of things to buy now sometimes has dubious recommendations, such as a pair of white and red pointy boots, £540 at avenue32.com.

The features: I like its 10 hot stories item, but some of the features really go nowhere. There is lots of quoting of ‘sources’. 

The columnists don’t quite cut it, mainly because they are not allowed enough words: make the type smaller, particularly on Polly Vernon’s page. 

The beauty pages, as with every single mag I have reviewed, plug the new Chanel range. A whole page of shower gels is just not working hard enough.

Celebrity mutterings: Nothing of note!

Most useless piece of advice: An entire feature telling readers how to make conversation at a wedding! When talking about whistle blower Edward Snowden you should say, ‘He’s handsome, isn’t he?’

 

Marie Claire, £3.80

Jessie J stars in September's Marie Claire

The cover: Jessie J, who is a good choice, but I find the hair cut very unbecoming. The Gucci dress is stunning.

The fashion: Using catwalk photos, with cut outs of clothes you can buy, is very cheap to do, and a bit old hat, and nowhere near as clever as ELLE.

There's yet another plug for Penelope Cruz’s new lingerie line and ‘101 ideas’ is now 25 years old… it needs a revamp.

The main shoots feature clothes too expensive even for Vogue: a sequin and bead dress by Gucci, at £20,600!

The features: A piece on internet dating by Katie Glass which has this gem when she meets up with a man she met online: ‘His accent is Polish, which I couldn’t tell from texting.’

She sums up: ‘I worry about the false degree of safety assumed by women looking for love on the web.’

But a good piece on mothers in the workplace and how they don’t pull their weight, and male suicide.

The beauty pages seem very dated. One 
shoot over several pages featuring close ups of a face, which has been a
beauty page staple for three decades, and lots of cheap catwalk and 
stock beauty photos.

The back page needs work: it can’t just be a page that is all about pearls ‘not just for monarchs and first ladies’. Its readers are smarter than this!

Celebrity mutterings: From designer Mary Katrantzou: ‘Sometimes I see one of my sculpted dresses and think, if I were slimmer I would wear it.’

Jessie J: ‘Salad, it’s not real food.’

Most useless piece of advice: ‘Sleep more to eat less.'
