Price tag: Under Owen Patterson's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' proposal, a family of four would pay almost £200 for clean-ups

Hard-pressed families are apparently ready to pay extra taxes of hundreds of pounds a year to have more litter cleared from their streets, ministers were told yesterday.

Civil servants based their recommendation on the views of barely more than 500 people who answered a questionnaire.

They believe council tax payers will accept hikes of nearly 20 per cent for better litter clearance and more if town halls remove chewing gum from pavements or clean up dog mess.

The litter taxes calculated by Owen Paterson’s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs would cost a family of four almost £200 – and much more for other kinds of clean-up.

DEFRA, which tried under Gordon Brown to charge ‘pay-as-you-throw’ taxes to take household refuse away, drew up its scale of possible council tax rises on the basis of research it commissioned.

The Institute for Transport Studies, at the University of Leeds, and the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University picked 561 people in London, Manchester and Coventry and set them questionnaires asking how much extra council tax they were prepared to pay. 

The results were greeted with outrage from campaign groups, saying the litter tax scale amounted to a stealth increase to council tax.

DEFRA said that for improved litter clearance people would pay £3.95 a month for each person in a home, which amounts to £189.60 a year for a family of four.

In all, a four-person household would be willing to pay more than £900 for noticeable improvements in ten aspects of their local environment, DEFRA said.

The sum would mean a rise of almost 90 per cent on the average English council tax bill of £1,045.

The document said potential charges would be ‘assessed and reflected in the decision-making process’ and that the numbers could ‘usefully inform national decisions’.

A load of rubbish: Campaigners and taxpayers criticised the proposal, saying the survey was too limited and the council should be doing these jobs anyway

But campaigners said taxpayers should refuse to pay any extra charges on their council bills.

Christine Melsom, of the Is It Fair? group, said: ‘These are all things the councils should be doing already. 

‘I am not willing to pay another penny, and I am puzzled how DEFRA found anybody who said they were. 

‘The Government will have a revolt on its hands if it tries to do anything to get this money from people.

‘Thousands and thousands will just refuse to pay.’

Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘DEFRA has absolutely no business spending taxpayers’ money commissioning surveys with the aim of suggesting hikes in council tax.

A Defra spokesperson said following publication: “We have absolutely no plans to make anyone pay more to pick up litter. It’s clear people care about the local environment and find litter a real nuisance and the study is a reminder to local councils to take the issue seriously."
