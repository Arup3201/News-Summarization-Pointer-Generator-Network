A new entrepreneurial duo with a taste for the 'zen' approach want to help men and women dress like 'everyday billionaires' by selling them nothing by black V-necked shirts.

BlackV Club will launch in the next few weeks and is the brainchild of University of Pennsylvania graduates Edward Lando, 22, and Yagil Burowski, 25; who argue that the smartest, wealthiest cats around don't have the time or mental effort to be clad in anything but black.

'People we look up to, from President Obama to Mark Zuckerberg, wear the same kind of clothes every day to have one less thing to think about,' the founders tell MailOnline. 'Looking good shouldn’t be time-consuming and frustrating. It should be an effortless, delightful experience.'

The shade of success? BlackV Club hasn't yet released any visuals other than its logo (left) but plans to sell a 'billionaire's uniform' of five identical black V-neck t-shirts, perfect for the 'too rich to care' set

'You can have any shirt you want, as long as it's a black V-neck,' the aptly minimalist website reads.

Mr Lando and Mr Burowski both claim to wear black V-necks 'more than usual' these days.

Although they haven't quite settled on which brand to debut with yet, they say the style will be short sleeved, unisex, and in the 'affordable luxury' price bracket.

'We want to be the stage for cool, up-and-coming brands,' the duo explains. 'The first item we’re selling is a black V-neck, and we’re most likely going to sell them in bundles of five.'

'After that, we’re going to continue helping you restock your closet with things that will look great on you, one item at a time.'

Of the 'aha' moment that sealed their fate as black V-neck purveyors, Mr Lando says: 'We realized we were running out of clothes. We each bought five black V-necks.

'When we got home and had them stacked and slipped them into our drawer, it felt like a very zen moment.'

The start-up claims to have had plenty of interested consumers sign up for membership, many from 'top tech companies.'
