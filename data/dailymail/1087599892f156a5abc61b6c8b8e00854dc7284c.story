Colonel Gaddafi's fourth son was in the process of building a luxury cruise liner with a giant glass tank containing six sharks when his father's regime was overthrown last year.

Hannibal Gaddafi envisioned the 120-ton shark aquarium to form the centrepiece of the vessel so it could wow up-to-3,500 passengers.

Inside the tank, he wanted two sand sharks, two white sharks and two blacktip reef sharks.

A commander of a Libyan militia holding two British journalists last night said they have been handed over to state intelligence, accusing them of espionage.

Tripoli militia commander Faraj al-Swehli said the two journalists were found with classified documents and pictures, including a data base of mercenaries apparently hired by then-ruler Moammar Gadhafi.

The journalists were identified as reporter Nicholas Davies and cameraman Gareth Montgomery-Johnson.

They were detained at the end of February and were working for Press TV, an Iranian TV network.

Four biologists would have taken 
permanent residence on the ship - called the Phoenicia - so they could 
look after the fish, while a dedicated shark food shop would have looked
 after their nutritional needs.

The 36-year-old had decided the liner would come complete with large statues, marble columns and gold-framed mirrors.

He dreamt up the extravagant concept after becoming frustrated at his inability to charter cruise ships at short notice.

However,
 the vessel never saw the light of day thanks to last year's unrest in 
Libya that saw his father Muammar killed by rebels forces in October.

Construction
 on the Phoenicia came to a halt last June - it is now being purchased 
by cruise ship giant MSC Cruises, who have renamed it the MSC Preziosa.

Pierfrancesco Vago, the firm's chief executive, told the Financial Times: 'I personally don’t know why, but he wanted a shark tank.'

MSG Cruises is now investing £460million now plans to use the vessel for cruises around the Greek islands starting in March 2013.

Hannibal fled with his wife and other members of the Gaddafi family to neighbouring Algeria in August, where he remains in exile.

He began his sea-faring career in 1993 and quickly rose to take charge of Libya's maritime industry.

Hannibal had previously tried, unsuccessfully, to hire cruise liners at short notice from MSG.

Mr Vago said: 'They had great difficulty understanding that cruise ship holidays are sold a year in advance, so there’s no way you could ever find availability of a cruise vessel at the notice he gave.'
