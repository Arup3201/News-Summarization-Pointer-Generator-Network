Prince Harry’s romance with girlfriend Cressida Bonas is reportedly 'on the rocks' because she is not ready to marry.

The fun-loving Prince, 28, apparently wants to settle down and start a family.

But 24-year-old Cressida wants an acting career, and hates the idea of being a 'trophy wife', friends have said.

Harry has been pictured today carrying a bear given to him by a young girl as a present for Kate and William's baby during a visit to Nottingham. He promised to hand deliver it to the couple.

The Sunday People has reported that the relationship is not 'firing on all cylinders'.

A friend told the paper that Harry wants to get married and settle down with Cressida.

They added: 'Sadly for Harry, she thinks she is too young to do that. She likes to go out and enjoy herself and is a long, long way off being anyone’s wife let alone a royal wife.'

The friend said there are problems with the relationship which are 'irreconcilable'.

The paper said that Cressida has told friends she is far too young to settle down and is scared of Harry's talk of marriage.

Prince William and Kate are also believed to be unhappy about his choice of girlfriend.

William was once linked with Cressida’s half-sister Lady Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, 33, during a temporary split with Kate.

She is now married to Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson’s son Sam, 27.

Harry and Cressida began dating last June and have been regularly seen at  public events and clubs together.

They
were introduced by the Prince’s cousin, Princess Eugenie, 23, at a time
when Harry had been single for 18 months following his split from 
former girlfriend Chelsy Davey, 27.

Cressida's father is Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas, and her mother is Sixties cover girl Lady Mary-Gaye Curzon, 66.

Friends said despite Cressida having the credentials of a royal bride Harry is not getting what he had hoped from the relationship and is said to be growing 'tired with her dishing out ultimatums.'

The source told the paper: 'If it keeps happening it will be Harry who calls off this relationship.

Harry is also said to miss former girlfriend, Zimbabwean born Chelsy.

They dated for four years but split up for good in 2010.
