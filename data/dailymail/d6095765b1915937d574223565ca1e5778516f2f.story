A disabled Walmart customer claims he has been banned for life for trying to get the retail giant to honor its price-matching policy.

Joe Cantrell, 49, of Queen Creek, Arizona, shops at Walmart because he is disabled and unable to earn a living. When he tried to save a few more bucks by matching prices, he was handcuffed and banned from ever returning to another Walmart store for the rest of his life, he says.

But, Walmart says the that Mr Cantrell became aggressive while arguing for the price match and that the manager he was speaking to felt threatened.

The employee called the police because he feared for his safety, the company says.

Loyal shopper: Joe Cantrell used to shop twice a day at Walmart

Mr Cantrell currently faces charges of threatening, intimidation and disorderly conduct.

Mr
Cantrell was banned during a recent stop at the Sun Tan Valley Walmart 
while trying to buy ornaments for his family’s Christmas tree, he told ABC 15.

‘I was handcuffed, humiliated and embarrassed in front of everybody at Walmart,’ the loyal shopper recalled.

The former professional wrestler told the station he used to visit Walmart twice a day.

‘I just love Walmart and that's why I go,’ he added, before pausing to gather himself and apologizing.‘Sorry I get a little emotional about this, because I'm disabled.’

Mr Cantrell sustained a number of serious injuries in the ring that prohibit him from being able to make any significant income, ad matching was just another way to stretch his precious pennies even further.

Charged: The price matching guru now faces criminal charges for trying to save a few dollars

Walmart employees told him price matching wasn’t allowed in the store, soon the police arrived.

‘When I left, he turned around and called the Pinal County Sheriff's Office and said he felt intimidated and threatened,’ he explained.

‘I was upset, but never once did I say anything to the gentleman.’

A return visit three days later resulted in the penny pincher being handed a court summons and a notice from Walmart headquarters banning him from any location worldwide – all while he was in handcuffs.

‘I felt shamed,’ he recalled. ‘I felt like I was the bad guy, and I know I'm not a bad guy.’

The cops eventually set him loose, he was so relieved he cried over the thought of going back home to his family.

Walmart's price matching policy, which is posted online, allows customers to bring in any circular from any competing store

'If you find a lower advertised price on an identical product, tell us and we’ll match it,' the website brags.

A message left by MailOnline seeking comment from Walmart was not returned.

The most loyal shopper Walmart likely ever had now faces charges of disorderly conduct, intimidation and threatening – for which he cannot afford a lawyer.
