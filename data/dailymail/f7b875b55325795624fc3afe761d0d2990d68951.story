Pupils at a Birmingham school were shown a violent, extremist film promoting jihadism, MPs were told today.

Ian Kershaw, who led an inquiry into the 'Trojan Horse' allegations, told the education select committee about the video as an example of 'bad behaviour' he had come across during his investigation.

It came amid claims that other English schools could have seen attempts to impose a hardline Muslim agenda on pupils.

The education select committee is carrying out its own inquiry into allegations of extremism in schools.

It follows reports by Ofsted, the Education Funding Agency, ex-terror chief Peter Clarke and Mr Kershaw.

Today Mr Kershaw insisted he had not been presented with any evidence of attempts to coerce young people into 'extremist, violent, jihadist activity'.

But he added: 'That's not to say that there weren't examples of very bad behaviour by some individuals in schools that needed to be corrected and addressed.'

Pressed to give examples, Mr Kershaw said: 'One would be the showing of a film which is completely inappropriate to young people, that was known by a senior member of staff to have happened and that member of staff in a senior position did not address that as a disciplinary matter.'

He described this film as a 'violent, extremist video', and when committee chairman Graham Stuart asked if it was 'jihadist, violent, extremist promotional video', Mr Kershaw indicated that it was.

'It was shown in one classroom at one moment and that should have been stopped and that should not have happened,' Mr Kershaw said, who was asked to carry out his inquiry by Birmingham City Council.

Ex-terror chief Peter Clarke said he would be 'surprised' if moves to gain control and influence were only restricted to a few schools in east Birmingham

Mr Clarke also said he had heard of the video. 'There were some suggestions that that sort of film had been shown or copied by a technician within one of the schools,' he said. 'But I did not come across direct evidence of the promotion of direct extremism, no.'

Mr Clarke also told the committee that there had been clear evidence of people who had espoused, were sympathetic to, or did not challenge extremist views.

He said he would be 'surprised' if moves to gain control and influence were only restricted to a few schools in east Birmingham.

Giving evidence to the Commons education select committee, he said it was incumbent on the government to investigate the situation.

'I'm not a great believer in coincidence and I would find it very surprising if this was only happening in the few schools that we had the time and opportunity to look at in east Birmingham,' Mr Clarke told the cross-party group of MPs.

'Some of the people who were involved in promulgating these techniques of gaining control and influence in schools have had national roles in various educational bodies and I know have lectured and taken part in conferences in other cities.

'So I think it is incumbent on the Department for Education and others to take a very careful look now to see whether the sorts of things we found in Birmingham are indeed happening elsewhere.

'I don't know, I haven't looked, but I'd be, I suppose in a way surprised, if there weren't, at least, some symptoms elsewhere.'

The former head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit was asked by former Education Secretary Michael Gove in April to lead an inquiry in allegations that a number of Birmingham schools have been targeted by individuals pushing a hardline Islamist agenda.

His report, published in July, concluded that there was 'clear evidence' that there were a number of people, associated with each other and in positions of authority within schools who 'espouse, endorse or fail to challenge extremist views'.

The damning document was highly critical of Birmingham City Council, accusing the authority of failing to support under-pressure headteachers dealing with inappropriate behaviour by governors.

In his report, Mr Clarke said he 'neither specifically looked for, nor found, evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern in Birmingham'.

Four different investigations into the Trojan Horse allegations of a hardline Muslim takeover plot at a number of Birmingham schools have reported back. Here are the main findings of each:

Ian Kershaw report, ordered by Birmingham City Council

Found no evidence of a 'conspiracy to promote an anti-British agenda, violent extremism or radicalisation in schools in east Birmingham'.

It concluded that key individuals were 'promoting and encouraging certain Islamic principles' in Birmingham classrooms amid poor oversight from education chiefs.

He suggested problems were allowed to run 'unchecked' due to what he branded 'weaknesses in the system and poor oversight of governance' mainly by the city council, but also by Ofsted, the Education Funding Agency and the Department for Education.

Peter Clarke report, ordered by former education secretary Michael Gove

Mr Clarke’s inquiry did not look for, or find, evidence of terrorism, radicalisation or violent extremism in the schools of concern.

It concluded there was a deliberate effort by a number of individuals to introduce an 'intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos' into a number of Birmingham schools.

This was achieved in some schools by gaining influence on governing bodies, installing 'sympathetic' head teachers and senior staff, appointing 'like-minded' people to key positions, and removing heads who were not 'compliant' with a particular agenda.

The 129-page report was highly critical of Birmingham City Council, accusing the authority of failing to support under-pressure head teachers who were dealing with inappropriate behaviour by governors. 

Ofsted

The watchdog inspected 21 schools in the city, concluding that a 'culture of fear and intimidation' had developed in some schools.

Warned that Birmingham City Council failed to support a number of schools in the area in their efforts to protect pupils from the 'risks of radicalisation and extremism'.

Five schools placed in special measures as a result: Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust (PVET) - as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. A sixth - Alston Primary - was already in special measures.

Education Funding Agency

The EFA, which oversees academies, published highly critical reports on PVET and Oldknow Academy at the same time as the Ofsted findings were made public.

It said PVET had 'many weaknesses', breached its funding agreement, and had restricted its curriculum to a 'conservative Islamic perspective'.

A separate report following the inspection of Oldknow Academy in Small Heath found it was 'taking on the practices of an Islamic faith school' and had excluded non-Muslim staff and pupils from an annual trip to Saudi Arabia for three years running.
