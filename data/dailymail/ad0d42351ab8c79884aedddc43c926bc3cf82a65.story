A single charger will have to be compatible with all mobile phones after a vote in the European Parliament.

MEPs want to ban the plethora of chargers for sale to cut down on electronic ‘clutter’.

It would end the hassle of having to buy a separate charger when swapping phones or having to hunt for the right charger when a phone battery goes flat and you are nowhere near home.

But the move could also create headaches for manufacturers, as the rule could be enforced as early as 2017.

The European Union voted for it yesterday as part of a radio equipment directive, which was pushed by German MEP and socialist, Barbara Weiler.

The Social Democrat, who is part of the socialist grouping in Brussels, said that it would also prevent interference between different radio equipment devices.

She added, ‘I am especially pleased that
 we agreed on the introduction of a common charger. This serves the 
interests both of consumers and the environment. It will put an end to 
charger clutter and 51,000 tonnes of electronic waste annually.’

But critics warned the single charger rule would lead to red tape for business and could trigger higher charges for consumers.

Paul Nuttall, Ukip’s deputy leader, said: ‘This is a backwards step because imposing a single charger stifles innovation, curbs research, and may impose extra costs on the consumer. The alternative and better action is to encourage diversity, competition and greater development.

‘The EU is hamstrung by the ideology of one-size-fits-all, be it economic policy, currency, fisheries policy and now even phone chargers.

'The UKIP alternative is to allow diversity to flourish and let the consumer, not the legislator or regulator decide.’

The draft law was approved by 550 votes to 12, with eight abstentions.

It will still have to be formally approved by the Council of Europe made up of ministers from across the EU.

Member states will have two years to put the rules into their national laws and manufacturers will have an additional year to comply.

There are at least half a billion mobile phones in the EU.

Most of them use different chargers, even if they are the same brand but a slightly different model.

Experts estimate that there are some 30 different types of charger currently on the market.

But phone makes such as Apple, Nokia, Motorola, Samsung, Sony Ericsson and ALCATEL have all signed an agreement to make their phones compatible with a single, USB style charger.
