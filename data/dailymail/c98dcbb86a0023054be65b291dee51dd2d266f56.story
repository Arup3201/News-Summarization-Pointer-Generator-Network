A teenage boy and girl were imprisoned in a basement by their adoptive parents for a month, it has been claimed.

The 13-year-old girl and a boy, 14, were allegedly being disciplined by the couple who were charged on Wednesday with child abuse and false imprisonment.

Paul Alan Drake, 45, and his wife JoAnn Marie, 44, only allowed the children out of the basement to go to school in Ankeny, Iowa. 

Charged: Paul Alan Drake, 45, and JoAnn Marie Drake, 44, were charged with child abuse and false imprisonment in Ankeny, Iowa

Punished: The suburban home where an Iowa couple allegedly locked their adopted teenage children in the basement for the best part of a month

Ankeny police chief Gary Mikulec told MailOnline via email that when the children arrived home from school, they were required to go down into the basement. Their parents would push breakfast and dinner under the locked door.

Paul and JoAnn Drake told authorities that the children needed discipline due to behavior problems.

The abuse came to light in September after one of the children told a school employee and the Department of Human Services was informed. The boy and girl were removed from the home on October 5 as police investigated.

It is unclear when the two children, who cannot be identified, were adopted or how long they lived at the suburban home. There were three other children in the house, authorities said, but they did not suffer a similar treatment.

After being charged, the couple were released from Polk County Jail on
bail. A trial date has not been set but they face up to ten years in 
prison.

Calls to the Drake home by MailOnline were not returned.

Mr and Mrs Drake married in June 1989, according to Facebook, where Paul Drake lists 'Devotional Christian' and 'I'm a CHRISTIAN & I'm PROUD' among his interests.
