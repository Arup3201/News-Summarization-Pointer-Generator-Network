Gary Lineker used to be the person everybody associated with Leicester, according to the waitress setting down some glasses on our table.

'Now we have Richard III,' she exclaimed with a radiant smile.

In Leicester at the moment, people talk of little else.

Much maligned: A new visitor centre dedicated to Richard III (left), who died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 (right) has just opened in Leicester - telling the full story of a king who history has painted as an evil tyrant

The winter of this Midland city's discontent has - literally - been made glorious summer by the bones of one man.

'Richard III? He's our Robin Hood,' said a Leicester tourism executive.

Nearby Nottingham ('Home of Robin Hood') has built a significant business on the back of the legendary (as in 'probably fictitious') medieval outlaw. But when a mechanical digger began carefully scratching down into the tarmac of a Leicester municipal staff car park two years ago this month, few could have guessed the city was about to strike its own tourist gold.

Overview: The new KRIII Visitor Centre will assess Richard's legend in his final resting place, Leicester

A key piece of England's historic jigsaw: The KRIII Visitor Centre has cost £4million to put into operation

A speculative archaeological dig had been authorised in order to explore the idea that beneath the car park lay the remains of the Grey Friars Church in which it was long suspected Richard III had been buried in 1485 following his defeat by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth Field.

Maths students at the University of Leicester, whose archaeological department was in charge of the dig, estimated that the odds of locating Richard III's remains were more than a million to one against.

The odds against locating the Royal remains within the first two hours of the dig were probably a billion to one - but this is exactly what happened.

The digger hit the archaeological bull's-eye at the first attempt, although it took lengthy DNA analysis to confirm the skeleton's identity.

Remarkably, a historian was able to track down two of the King's direct descendants for the purpose of DNA-matching, but experts suggest that probably 14 million of us are less directly related to Richard.

On the map: The visitor centre will allow Leicester to steal some of Nottingham's thunder as a tourist city

The confirmation of the discovery has fuelled about of Richardmania that few could have predicted.

Celebrations in the city move up a gear this week with the opening of the stunning new £4 million King Richard III visitor centre (RIII: Dynasty, Death And Discovery) situated in an old grammar school building adjacent to the famous car park.

Events reach a climax next spring (the exact date has yet to be announced) when the remains are ceremonially interred in a magnificent new tomb created at an estimated cost of £2.5million in Leicester's cathedral, a stone's throw from the burial site.

The best way, it is said, to get your own back on your enemies is to outlive them.

Richard may have died in 1485, but his name has indelibly survived. By contrast, hardly anybody remembers his conqueror Henry VII, the first of the Tudors.

Richard III's name largely lingers because of the Shakespeare play famously filmed in 1955 with Laurence Olivier in the title role.

A blast from the past: Richard's skeleton was unearthed below a car park in Leicester early last year

Working under the Tudor Queen Elizabeth I, the Bard served up a dramatic dish aimed at delighting his ruler; the play presents Richard III as the very devil whom Henry Tudor had every right to topple.

This demonisation stimulated a growing campaign by present-day Richard-lovers - known as Ricardians - to set the record straight.

It was leading Ricardian Philippa Langley who was the driving force behind the car park excavation two years ago.

The new visitor centre wonderfully tells this whole story from medieval times up to the present. Robin Hood certainly has nothing on this.

Even more surprising to visitors will be that Leicester is one of England's loveliest historic cities, with a wealth of old buildings and lovely ancient streets.

If you have school-age children whose curriculum includes the Tudors, make a trip to Leicester this summer a must.

If Richard III had beaten Henry on that August day, there would have been no Tudors, no Henry VIII, no protestant reformation, perhaps no loss of our extensive colonies in France - imagine if the Dordogne was still British.

Grand arrival: Richard will be buried in Leicester Cathedral - where a plaque already remembers him - in 2015

Part of the reason our world changed has lain undisturbed for more than 500 years on a patch of land that became the staff car park of Leicester social services. You really couldn't make it up.

KRIII Visitor Centre (www.kriii.com)

By
 lavish use of high-tech presentation and a 3D-printed copy of his 
skeleton, the excellent new centre provides brilliantly concise accounts
 of the rise and fall of Richard III, his burial and his rediscovery in 
2012.

How
 did they know where to look? How did they know it was him when the 
bones were discovered? Was Richard as bad as Shakespeare suggested? This
 will grab the attention of all visitors aged three to 103, and is the 
perfect start to your Richard tour.

Leicester Cathedral (www.leicestercathedral.org)

Very
 close to the visitor centre, this is where King Richard's remains will 
be interred in a new tomb - expect a lavish, televised ceremony next 
spring.

As cathedrals go, Leicester's is modestly proportioned but very charming.

Blue Boar Inn

In
 1880, John Fulleylove made a famous painting of Richard III on 
horseback outside Leicester's Blue Boar Inn the day before the fatal 
battle.

Richard
 is believed to have spent the night at the Inn in his own bed. On the 
site of the Blue Boar Inn now stands… a Travelodge.

Bow Bridge

On
 his way to Bosworth, King Richard passed over this bridge 'with great 
triumph and pomp'. After the battle, his body was brought back to the 
city over the same bridge, his naked corpse slung over a horse. It was 
subsequently claimed - falsely as we know now - that Richard's body was 
dug up from his grave and thrown in the river here.

Leicester Castle

There
 is little to be seen of the ancient Norman castle that would have been 
well known to Richard III. The Great Hall was used, until fairly 
recently, as the Assizes Court where Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie was a 
frequent visitor as a court reporter.

Newarke

This
 is the ancient and thoroughly delightful heart of old Leicester. It was
 in a church here that Richard III's naked body was put on display - 
after being paraded through the streets.

Grey Friars spirited the body away for a hasty burial in their church.

Donington Le Heath Manor House (www.doningtonleheath.com)

This
 exquisite 13th Century property has what is claimed to be the very oak 
four-poster bed in which Richard III slept before heading to Bosworth.

Richard
 had the habit of taking his own bed with him when he travelled, so one 
presumes this four-poster is an early example of flat-pack furniture.

Bosworth (www.bosworthbattlefield.com)

Sixteen
 miles from Leicester, Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and Country 
Park provides a wonderfully vivid account of the battle.

The conflict was surprisingly quick - less than two hours.

And casualties were relatively slight: about 1,000 people died during the fighting.

Handle the terrible weapons and learn how the fatal blow was delivered to Richard - there's fun for all the family.

York

Although
 hardcore Ricardians The Plantagenet Alliance fought a protracted legal 
action to have Richard III buried at
 York Minster, actually his links with York are slight. Go, however, to 
look at the Minster's Richard window. And there are Henry VII and 
Richard III Experiences run by the people who operate the Jorvik Viking 
Centre.

Accommodation and restaurants

Turn
 your Richard III trip into a glorious short break by staying at the 
excellent Stapleford Park hotel (www.staplefordpark.com), a Downton 
Abbey experience in wonderful countryside about 30 minutes' drive from 
Leicester near Melton Mowbray. A double room costs from £160 per night.

Great
 restaurants in the area include The Red Lion Inn (www.theredlioninn.co.uk) in Stathern. In Leicester city centre itself, a short walk 
from the cathedral, is The Case restaurant (www.thecase.co.uk).
