James Grant was jailed for 18 months for perverting the course of justice after the letter he arranged to be written, which claimed that the alleged victim had made up the attack, caused the trial to be abandoned

An alleged rapist is being freed after derailing his trial by faking letters from his accuser declaring her ‘love’ for him.

James Grant, 27, handed the two documents to his lawyers – forcing the judge to abort the case for legal reasons.

The woman who said he raped her had already endured the trauma of giving evidence in court.

She could not face doing so again in a retrial, so withdrew her complaint. This meant it was not possible to retry him on the rape charge.

The letters had been sent to another inmate, passed on to Grant and handed to his legal team who treated them as new evidence.

He claimed they were written by one of his victim’s friends on her behalf but she denied this. A writing expert confirmed she did not write them.

Gerry Wareham, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said the letters were ‘fabrications’ and Grant’s actions were ‘devious and utterly callous’. He said the CPS ‘offered all possible support’ to address the woman’s concerns about a retrial.

Lawyers also considered reading out her original evidence but this was ruled out ‘due to the circumstances of the case’, said Mr Wareham. He added: ‘In the end, the case could not proceed without her testimony and we respect her wish not to give evidence a second time.’

Grant was prosecuted over the faked letters and other attempts to persuade the woman not to testify.

He admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for 18 months at Hull Crown Court on Wednesday. But he was due to be released immediately because of time spent on remand.

If convicted of rape, Grant, of Roos, near Withernsea, East Yorkshire, would almost certainly have been behind bars for years. The average jail term for rapists is eight years.

He was charged with raping the woman in August last year, after meeting her through social media, and remanded in custody.

In January, he went on trial and denied rape. Prosecutor David Bradshaw told this week’s case how the letters ‘caused the rape trial to be stopped’.

He continued: ‘Our understanding is the letters were written on Mr Grant’s say so, but he claimed they were written by the alleged victim.’

While inside Hull Prison, pictured, James Grant also persuaded a fellow inmate to send the alleged victim a letter offering her money to drop the case

Grant had 
made other attempts to force the woman to drop the case. Mr Bradshaw 
said: ‘He got another inmate to send a letter to the alleged victim’s 
grandma’s address.

‘While not threatening, it was full of innuendo and promises of money.’

Grant
 also contacted an ex-girlfriend telling her to ‘sort it’ although she 
does not appear to have taken any action, said Mr Bradshaw.

Another inmate, Darby Owen, 19, sent the woman a text message dictated by Grant.

Owen,
 of Hedon, Hull, admitted twice perverting the course of justice and was
 given four months in jail, He was due to be released yesterday because 
of time spent on remand.

Judge
 Mark Bury told Grant that faking the letters was ‘a particularly 
serious offence’. Passing sentence, he added: ‘The letters you wrote to 
the alleged victim were not abusive or threatening but they did amount 
to emotional blackmail.

‘There was a persistent series of attempts to persuade the woman not to give evidence.’

Grant was also given a restraining order to keep him away from his accuser.

Humberside Police refused to comment on the case.
