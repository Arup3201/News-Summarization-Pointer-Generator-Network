Residents in a sleepy Washington neighbourhood got a dramatic wakeup call on Friday morning after a low flying plane made an unexpected delivery.

A large piece of metal the size of a refrigerator door plummeted to the ground in Kent just before 7am - but it miraculously did not hit anyone.

'We heard a big crash, like a slap, slap,' Maureen Rinabarger told KOMO, 'And it did sound like a big large piece of metal.'

Breakaway: The metal is said to be a landing gear door from a Boeing 767 airplane

Witnesses say the landing gear door hit the ground and skipped about 30 feet before stopping in a street.

'We were grateful that no children were hurt and it didn't hit a house or a car,' said Ms Rinabarger.

A few feet more to its side, however, and it would have with a maroon Volkswagen seen parked by its crash site. And for neighbour John Hanson, who was returning from a coffee run that morning, any later and it could have been deadly for him too.

'Came back to turn into my driveway and there was a part of an airplane sitting here,' he told KING5 News.

Sight to see: Witnesses say the panel hit the ground and skipped about 30 feet (9 meters) before stopping in a street and narrowly missing a parked car

Identifying: An identification plate is seen tipping residents to the unusual object's origin at the time of its fall

Photos show part of an identification plate on the object that has the word 'aircraft' along with a serial number across it.

Neighbours say a cargo jet flew low over the area, about 15 miles south of Seattle, at about the same time the part came down.

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating with a Boeing 767 plane - a mid-size, wide-body twin-engine -  said to be responsible.

By Friday afternoon the FAA could not say if they had located the specific plane it came from.
