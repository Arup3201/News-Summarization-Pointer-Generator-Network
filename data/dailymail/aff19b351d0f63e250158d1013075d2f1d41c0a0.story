The controversial striker's unveiling was only allowed on Thursday after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) cleared the 27-year-old to train with his new team-mates and play in friendlies.

The £75million signing from Liverpool is currently serving a four-month ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during their World Cup Group D encounter.

He had initially been forced to train away from his new team-mates but since the softening of his suspension sanctions he is now expected to feature in the Catalan club's pre-season friendly on Monday night.

Luis Enrique's side face  Leon in the Gamper Cup at the Nou Camp, with the Spaniard confirming on Sunday that his new striker will play a part in the match.

'The impression is that he is a player of a very high standard,' the Barca coach was quoted as saying at a press conference.

'I know how we play and he fits how we play. I would like to give him some minutes (on Monday). He did a great job when he trained alone.'
