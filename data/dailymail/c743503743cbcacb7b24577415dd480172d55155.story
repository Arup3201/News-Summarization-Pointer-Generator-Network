The scientific consensus on climate change, to the tune of 97 per cent of experts, is that humans are changing Earth’s climate for the worse.

But some people continue to insist that some of these scientists are wrong, incurring anger among those trying to teach people about the dangers of climate change.

And one professor from Texas has had enough - he’s decided to offer £17,500 ($30,000) to anyone that can prove to him that climate change is not man-made.

Dr Christopher Keating is offering £17,500 ($30,000) to anyone that can prove to him that man-made activities (stock image shown) are causing Earth's climate to drastically alter. He is not expecting to have to stump up any cash, though, as he is certain that the theory on which their is an overwhelming consensus is correct

Dr Christopher Keating, who previously taught at the University of South Dakota, says the climate change deniers of today are engaged in a campaign that is similar to the one waged by tobacco advocates to deny a link between smoking and lung cancer.

1. Dr Keating will award £17,500 ($30,000) of his own money to anyone that can prove, via the scientific method, that man-made global climate change is not occurring.

2. There is no entry fee.

3. You must be 18 years old or older to enter.

4. Entries do not have to be original, they only need to be first.

5. Dr Keating is the final judge of all entries but will provide his comments on why any entry fails to prove the point.

Previously he had been offering £5,850 ($10,000) to the first person to prove climate changing wasn’t man-made but he has since upped the reward to £17,500 ($30,000).

All someone needs to do is show him evidence that unequivocally proves he is wrong on his blog.

The challenge is open to anyone over 18 and there is no entry fee.

'I will 
judge all entries and show why they fail or succeed in the challenge,' Dr Keating, also the author of Undeniable: Dialogues on Global Warming, said.

'Entries don’t even have to be original. They just have to be first.'

He has 
been involved, at some level, with climate change for 30 years, having 
been a professor of physics for over 20 years and teaching at the U.S. 
Naval Academy and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.

'Greenhouse gases are on the rise and the effects are evident: the earth is getting warmer, weather everywhere is changing, the oceans are warming at an alarming rate and ice caps are melting,' he says (right)

Dr Keating
 says he is more than willing to pay the money but doesn’t believe it 
will happen.

'I’m a scientist and I have to go where the science leads 
me.

'I
 have been studying climate change for a long time and I am certain my 
money is safe. They are in the business of denial and deception, not 
science.

'But, if someone could give me a scientific proof global warming isn’t real, it would be worth the money.'

And he says there are ulterior motives to the climate deniers, mainly that they are funded by organisations with a vested interest in fossil fuels.

‘A recent study done at Drexel University showed that denier organisations have received nearly $560 million [£330 million] over an eight-year period,’ he says.

‘They traced this money to about 140 different organisations, including many with ties to the fossil fuel industry.

‘These are the people that stand to lose money if we do something about climate change.

‘It simply shatters any credibility the deniers might have ever had.’

An analysis of global temperatures by Nasa scientists showed that 2013 was the seventh warmest year since 1880 (tied with 2006 and 2009). Nine of the 10 warmest years on record all have occurred since 2000, with 2010 and 2005 ranking as the warmest

Keating says the results of climate change science are so overwhelming that the only way to deny global warming is to deny science itself.

‘Greenhouse gases are on the rise and the effects are evident: the earth is getting warmer, weather everywhere is changing, the oceans are warming at an alarming rate and ice caps are melting.

‘Every where you look you see evidence of global warming. This isn’t something that is only going to occur in the future, it is happening right now.'

If someone can prove him otherwise, though, he is willing to change his tune - but at the moment he doesn't see that as being very likely.

He is so sure of his claim that he is not expecting to pay out any time soon
