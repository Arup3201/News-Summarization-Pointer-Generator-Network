A British fashion student who claims she was raped in a toilet on a college trip to Florence has been told she faces up to 12 years in an Italian jail on false allegation charges.

Serena Bowes, 21, who has waived her right to anonymity, was on an undergraduate visit to the city when she says she was raped in a nightclub toilet.

However, weeks after she returned home to Newcastle, she received a letter to say she faced charges for falsifying the rape - which she strongly denies.

Her family have until today to find legal representation to present her case in Italy, and if they fail they say the trial could go ahead in her absence.

Miss Bowes, who is hoping to join the Army after she graduates, said: 'I just don't talk about it. It's as if I'm telling someone else's story.

'I will never go back to Florence because of what happened, never mind going to prison there.

'If I receive a prison sentence somewhere between four and 12 years my life will be over.' 

Her mother Adele, 41, added: 'It's like my hands are tied behind my back and I'm waiting for them to kidnap my daughter.'

Miss Bowes, who is in her second year at Newcastle College, was on the trip to Italy in May as part of her fashion course.

She had visited the nightclub in the city's Via della Vigna Vecchia with a group of friends, and says she had started talking to a man inside. 

She claims that as the the pair were made their way to the VIP area of the club, she was taken to the unisex toilet and attacked.

The alleged assault was reported to police, and gave statements to officers, as well as being examined in hospital.

Italian news reports from the time the allegations were made said police had watched CCTV images which showed Miss Bowes leaving the bathroom together with her alleged attacker, who was known in the nightclub. He faced no further action. 

Reliving the experience: Miss Bowes returned to Newcastle and tried to put the trip behind her, until she was sent a letter from Italian police informing her she faced charges for falsifying the rape - which she  denies

Miss Bowes then returned to Newcastle and tried to put the trip behind her, until she was sent a letter from Italian police, which she took to a nearby police station to be translated.   

'I thought it was done with and I could get on with my life,' she said.

'I didn't think he was going to get prosecuted so I just wanted to get on with my life but this has brought everything back. It doesn't feel what actually happened is the problem any more - it feels like that has actually been forgotten about. Once this is all over that's when it's going to come back and hit me.'

Her mother is trying to find legal advice to help with the case, and has raised the issue with her local MPs and MEPs, but says she is yet to find the help Miss Bowes needs.   

Carole Kitching, Principal at Newcastle College, said: 'Twenty-one-year-old student, Serena Bowes, told us about a serious assault whilst on a undergraduate college trip to Italy earlier this year. It took place during their free time, and as soon as staff were alerted they contacted the police and accompanied Serena, with the police to the hospital.

'Serena has been offered counselling and we continue to support her through this difficult time. We have met with her family on a number of occasions and have been in contact with her local MP about her case.'

Under the Italian justice system if Miss Bowes is prosecuted she would not have to be present at the trial. If she were convicted she would be automatically entitled to two appeals.

If she lost those appeals, judges could then start extradition proceedings although this is very unlikely as in Italy most sentences are suspended, except for very serious crimes. 

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of an incident involving a British national in May 2014. We provided consular assistance when notified of this in October 2014.

'We stand ready to provide further support to the individual and their family at this difficult time.'

A Home Office spokesperson: 'As a matter of long standing policy and practice we neither confirm nor deny whether an extradition request has been made or received until such time as an arrest is made in relation to that request.'
