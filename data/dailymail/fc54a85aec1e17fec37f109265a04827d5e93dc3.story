A Royal Marines officer who spent a year training and fighting alongside Afghan tribesmen has been honoured for inspiring a local resistance to the Taliban – drawing comparisons with Lawrence of Arabia.

Captain Owen Davis, 25, who immersed himself in the culture and lifestyle of villagers in southern Afghanistan, has won the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC), Britain’s second-highest battlefield honour.

Since the UK-led campaign in Helmand Province began seven years ago, hundreds of British officers have attempted to mentor Afghan personnel, with varying success.

Captain Owen Davis of the Royal Marines immersed himself in Afghan culture, growing a beard, wearing a neck-scarf and learning to speak  Pashto

Few have gone to the lengths of Captain Davis, who spent every day and night with a 25-man unit of Afghan Local Police (ALP), cooking and eating with them, learning their language and gaining their trust.

Captain Davis has been credited with turning the hope for a functioning ALP force into a reality in Helmand’s strategically significant district of Nahr-e Saraj.

So successful was his influence that his commanders tore up the cultural advisors’ rulebook and granted Davis ‘artistic licence’ to live as an Afghan.

With a wispy beard hanging six inches from his jaw and a traditional black Afghan scarf wrapped around his neck, by day Davis led the local policemen on patrol missions and firefights with rebel insurgents.

In order to gain their trust completely, he also lived, ate, and slept with them, becoming so fluent in their Pashto language that he could participate in traditional night-time poetry recitals.  

The CGC – second only to the VC as a gallantry award – is intended to recognise his willingness to remain so perilously exposed for so long, and his bravery when confronted by the enemy.

Now his feats have attracted comparisons with T.E. Lawrence, the British officer who inspired the Arab revolt against Turkish Ottoman forces in Northern Africa during the First World War.

His exploits were celebrated in the epic 1962 adventure film starring Peter O’Toole.

Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Davis modestly dismissed any comparison and praised his bosses from the UK’s newly formed Defence Cultural Specialist Unit (DCSU) for giving him such personal freedom.

He said: ‘So long as I was providing intelligence I could just get on with it.

‘My job was to go into areas where we didn’t have a lot of knowledge, to speak to the villagers and to train the local police officers.

‘In these areas allegiances could change in a moment, everyone knew somebody in the Taliban. I would lead these Afghan elements in engagements against the insurgents.’

He added: ‘Sharing a bed with the Afghans wasn’t the done thing, nobody else was doing that. I suppose I went a bit bush, especially with the really horrible beard.

'I got accustomed to the title “Toran” too, which means captain in Pashto.

Owen Davis only joined the Marines after a back injury robbed him of his dream to row at the Beijing Olympics but has now been awarded The Conspicuous Gallantry Cross, the second highest honour

‘Fluency in Pashto was really important as I would have lost a lot of the wit and banter without that.

'We were getting attacked by the Taliban every day. Then in the evening we’d prepare food together and recite poetry.

‘The Pashtuns have a history of great poets. We’d listen to this verse, which is often set to dreadful disco beats, until about midnight then fall asleep together on mattresses or these wicker beds outside, gazing at the stars.

‘We’d tell jokes too. They had a good sense of humour, a lot of slapstick. If somebody fell over they’d burst out laughing.

'They loved cricket and being fairly ignorant about it I had to learn fast. We’d play together.

‘Family matters were also very important, so I’d always ask about their parents and children.

'These were young guys from the villages, eager to do their bit and after a month or two together I did trust them.

‘Had there been any insurgents among them I’m sure those ALP I was closest to would have protected me.’

Davis’s friendships with his Afghans were tested to the extreme on June 13 last year when the ALP joined soldiers from the Grenadier Guards on an operation to capture a Taliban sniper – a mission which cost the life of Lance Corporal James Ashworth, who was later awarded the VC.

Davis recalled: ‘Me and the Afghans knew there was enemy inside the compound so we pushed in.

'The guy with me was cut down pretty much straight away, killed after taking a burst of 15 to 20 rounds. He was touching distance from me.

‘As I moved forward to drag him out a grenade rolled around the corner. I jumped over a wall, landing upside down in a ditch. The guy who died was in his late 20s and was someone I was very close to. So I was really, really sad. Losing a close colleague is the worst feeling in the world.’

On a follow-up assault, L/Cpl Ashworth was killed trying to post a grenade through the window of a Taliban mud hut.

Davis cleared the remaining enemy from the building and rescued another British casualty.

Davis, who stands 6ft 4in and weighs 15 stone, joined the Marines after a serious back injury shattered his dreams of winning Olympic rowing glory in Beijing.

Now he is leaving the Marines to retrain as a doctor, and is hoping to work with medical charities in Africa. But Afghanistan will forever be in his heart.

‘I was distraught to leave that country and feel so privileged to have got so close to the people,’ he said.

‘My hope is that we’ve done enough in terms of security to allow the Afghans to be educated, because that is how the next generation will build their country.

'If we’ve provided that security then we’ve done a good job.’

Former British commander in Afghanistan, Colonel Richard Kemp, said: ‘He has shown the character, the empathy and the courage of T.E. Lawrence and achieved results far beyond what could be expected of one individual.

'Men of Davis’s calibre are most rare, even in the Royal Marines.’
