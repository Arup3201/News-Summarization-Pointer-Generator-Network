A man claims a botched skin graft has left him with a football-sized hernia sticking out from his stomach.

Yves Rivest, 36, says his problems began in 2003 when a rubbish truck ran him over while he was working.

He explained that he slid underneath the lorry while it was reversing. The front wheel then passed between his legs and drove up onto his stomach.

Yves Rivest, 36, developed a football sized hernia after having a skin graft on his stomach. He needed the operation after suffering serious stomach injuries when he was run over by a rubbish truck

The former sanitation worker, from Montreal, in Canada, was in a coma for three weeks and woke up to find his intestines outside his body.

Doctors sealed his abdominal wall but Mr Rivest says the repair failed and he needed a skin graft to cover the wound.

Speaking to the Toronto Sun he said: ‘After the accident, the surgeon came to see me and explained my intestines would be in bags for at least a year.

‘Once my intestines healed, they would reattach them, which they did, but it never lasted.

‘There was so much pressure in my stomach that the sutures gave way completely and my stomach began to open.'

Mr Rivest now wants surgery to remove the hernia but says surgeons are refusing to carry out the procedure unless he loses weight. He says it is impossible for him to lose weight as the hernia means he cannot workout

Mr Rivest said that he now weighs 17st but that he would only weigh 15st if the hernia was removed

He added that he was left with little skin on his stomach meaning he needed a skin graft from his leg in 2004.

However, he says the graft has now turned into the 28in hernia that weights more than 2st.

Mr Rivest says doctors are now refusing to operate unless he loses weight - but says he can't lose weight because of the hernia.

He explained that he has been told he must not push, pull or lift anything heavy because of the hernia and that this makes it impossible for him to workout.

He added that while he weighs 17st now, he would weigh 2st less if the hernia was removed.

The graft temporarily covered the wound successfully and held his intestines in but it then turned into the hernia which now weighs more than 2st
