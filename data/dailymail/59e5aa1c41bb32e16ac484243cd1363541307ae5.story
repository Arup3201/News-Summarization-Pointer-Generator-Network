The deadly Ebola outbreak will be ended in 2015, the outgoing chief of the United Nations team fighting the virus has said. 

Anthony Banbury said the number of Ebola cases would be brought down to zero by the close of the year, but admitted there was a 'long and difficult way to go'. 

He said: 'We are engaged in a big battle with this disease.'

Mr Banbury said the target of having 100 per cent burials by the end of the month was now on track 

The virus, first identified in Guinea's remote south-east in December 2013, has killed nearly 8,000 people, mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

Faced with criticism that not enough was being done to combat the disease, UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon set up the UN Ebola Emergency Response mission (UNMEER) in September. 

Mr Banbury, who headed that mission, said: 'We have a long and difficult path ahead of us. We have not come anywhere close to ending the crisis. 

'We have done a lot in 90 days. It has been a very successful response effort but we have a long way to go.

'In terms of looking forward we are engaged in a big battle with this disease that attacks people who shows acts of caring and kindness. 

'It is going to be extremely hard for us to bring it down to zero, but that is what we will do. I believe we will end Ebola in 2015.'

A spike of cases in Sierra Leone meant UNMEER missed its target of ensuring 70 per cent of all Ebola patients were being treated in isolation units by early December and the same number who died from Ebola were buried properly.

Mr Banbury said there were now enough functioning treatment centres in the region.

He said the target of 100 per cent safe burials by end of January 2015 was now on track.

Mr Banbury will be replaced by veteran humanitarian official Ould Cheikh Ahmed of Mauritania today. 

Pauline Cafferkey contracted Ebola while working for Save the Children treating the sick in Sierra Leone

The nurse was diagnosed with Ebola on Monday and was seen today walking from an ambulance at Glasgow Airport as she was moved by military aircraft to London yesterday

After being put on a cocooned bed Ms Cafferkey was loaded on to the jet, which took off on Monday morning and landed at RAF Northolt near Heathrow

Earlier this week, the World Health Organization said the number of people infected by the virus in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea had passed 20,000. 

Last week, Save the Children nurse Pauline Cafferkey was diagnosed with the virus in Glasgow upon her return from Sierra Leone. 

She is being treated with plasma from patients who have survived the virus and an experimental antiviral drug at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London. 

It is the same isolation unit that nursed William Pooley back to health after he contracted Ebola in August.

He recovered and has returned to West Africa to continue his mission.
