A 13-year-old Colorado boy suspected of shooting his father dead and concealing the killing for days made his first court appearance Monday as prosecutors weighed whether to charge him as an adult.

Kai Kelly was arrested last week on suspicion of first-degree murder in the death of his father, Joseph Kelly Jr, in the small mountain town of Gypsum, about 105 miles west of Denver.

Jill Sarmo, spokeswoman for the Eagle County District Attorney's Office, said the boy was appointed a public defender Monday and will be formally charged at a later date.

She said prosecutors have not decided whether to charge him as an adult.

The elder Kelly died from two gunshot wounds to the head fired from a .22-caliber rifle, Eagle County coroner Kara Bettis said.

‘One
 (shot) was to the back of the head and one to the temple,’ Bettis told 
reporters, adding that the shot to the temple was a ‘contact’ wound.

Based on the condition of the decomposing body, it appeared that the man had been dead for six days, Bettis said.

Authorities
 have not released a possible motive for the slaying but said Kai Kelly 
was under investigation for spray painting graffiti, and Joseph Kelly 
had failed to show for a meeting with police about the incident.

Kai was arrested last Monday after a tip from the unidentified employer led deputies to check on the family.

Authorities said the boy answered the door and told them his 50-year-old father was dead in the home.

Before the slaying, the boy was under 
scrutiny for spraying graffiti, the Eagle County Sheriff's Office said.

Mr Kelly didn't show up for a meeting with deputies last Wednesday to 
discuss the graffiti investigation in the western Colorado town, but it 
wasn't until the employer's tip that authorities went to investigate, 
sheriff's office spokeswoman Jessie Mosher said.

Kai Kelly was being held in a detention facility on suspicion of first-degree murder.

The
 sheriff's office said the boy's mother, Lynn Kelly, had not been living in the home 
with her son or ex-husband.

Neighbors
 told KCNC-TV that the man and his son lived in the home for more than a
 year, but no one heard anything out of the ordinary until deputies 
showed up.

Joseph Kelly's employer at the Eagle County ECO Transit Department said the son called in to report his father sick several days in a row. He grew suspicious and reported the situation at around 11.30am May 5.

'Several' types of weapons were in the home, according to VailDaily.

The Denver Post reported Kai Kelly is a student at St. Clare of Assisi Catholic School, and he also has been taking lessons at a karate school in Gypsum. In November, he took third place at the U.S. Karate Nationals.
