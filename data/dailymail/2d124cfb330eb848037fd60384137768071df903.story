A dozen people, including former Marseille sporting director Jose Anigo, have been held for questioning as part of an investigation into France striker Andre-Pierre Gignac’s transfer to the club, judicial sources said on Tuesday.

The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that people close to organised criminal gangs in Marseille were also being held.

Anigo, who now lives in Morocco, was arrested when he got off a plane late in the afternoon, a judicial source said.
