The soldier who helped propel Ron Paul into third place in Iowa allegedly violated military rules by wearing his uniform on the candidate’s podium.

Army Corporal Jesse Thorsen, 28, of West Des Moines, Iowa, has been a visible presence with the Texas Representative throughout his campaign.

U.S. military rules allow active-duty soldiers to support political candidates but they are banned from doing so as an armed forces representative.

‘I’m really excited about a lot of his ideas, especially when it comes to bringing the soldiers home,’ Corporal Thorsen told CNN in an interview.

‘I’ve been serving for ten years now and all ten years of those have been during wartime. I would like to see a little peace time army.’

The 10-year Iraq and Afghanistan veteran has already served abroad twice and has a 9/11 tattoo with ‘Remember’ and a Twin Towers picture.

CNN reporter Dana Bash then told him that some Republicans think Mr Paul’s ideas are dangerous because he wants to bring U.S. troops home.

‘I think it would be even more dangerous to start nit-picking wars with other countries,’ Corporal Thorson replied to Ms Bash.

He then went on to say ‘someone like Iran, Israel is more than capable of…’ before the video feed cut out and returned to host Wolf Blitzer.

Conspiracy theorists have claimed  the soldier was cut off because producers thought he ‘was too smart for his own good’, reported Mediaite.

The soldier was in fact breaking military rules by wearing his uniform while endorsing Mr Paul on camera and on stage, reported the Huffington Post.

The Defense Department Directive 1344.10 (4.1.1.9) says an active-duty serviceman can only attend political activities ‘when not in uniform’.

It adds they can only do this ‘when no inference or appearance of official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement can reasonably be drawn’.

'His foreign policy is by far hands down better than any candidates out there. We don't need to be picking fights overseas'

Corporal Thorsen was clearly endorsing Mr Paul on camera and on stage when he was invited by the candidate to speak at his rally.

'How about Ron Paul,’ Corporal Thorsen told the crowd on CNN. ‘If there's any man out there who's had a vision for this country it is definitely him.

'His foreign policy is by far hands down better than any candidates out there,’ he added. ‘We don't need to be picking fights overseas.’

'I'm flabbergasted,’ he said on CNN. ‘This is an incredible moment for me, I can't believe it - it's like meeting a rock-star.'
