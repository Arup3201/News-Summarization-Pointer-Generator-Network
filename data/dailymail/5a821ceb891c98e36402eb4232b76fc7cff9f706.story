A top designer has been forced to cancel his much-anticipated European press day after his entire spring/ summer collection was stolen from a train bound for London.

The 46-look range was due to go on show in the capital today - giving British fashion editors the chance to sample next year's trendsetters.

But in an e-mail circulated to the media yesterday, the company said it could no longer go ahead because of the theft.

Personal passion: Bright colours, zip-up tops and angular collars add a sporty twist to the ensemble

It said: 'Our press day tomorrow in 
the Marc Jacobs store is cancelled due to the theft of the spring/ 
summer 2012 collections during its transfer from Paris.'

There's no indication as yet on who 
was behind the heist or how such a daring raid could have been pulled 
off given the logistics required to lift the collection from a train.

As the pieces are effectively 
worthless because they are not yet in production, it has led to fears 
that counterfeiters may be involved.

The collection, which consisted of drop-waist skirts, cellophane cocktail dresses and translucent and tinsel fabrics, attempted to give the 'feel of a Southern dance hall', Jacobs said of his show in September.

Now editors won't be able to see the designs, which could mean fewer editorial placements for the brand in European publications.

When the collection debuted during New York Fashion Week, it was described by Newsweek/The Daily Beastâ€™s Robin Givhan as 'a refreshing collection because it went its own way.'

He added: 'The designer was unwilling to fall under the spell of fuchsia, cobalt blue, and bright orange. This was a personal passion.'

The suspected theft is further embarrassment for Marc Jacobs after an advert for his perfume Oh, Lola was banned because it appeared to 'sexualise a child'.

It featured 17-year-old actress Dakota Fanning, but she looked younger in the magazine advert, where she was sitting on the floor with the perfume bottle between her thighs.
