There is no doubting the significance of Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby now.

Debate has raged in Newcastle as to which their fans would rather see - a place in the Capital One Cup semi-final or a first win over Sunderland in six attempts. The majority sided with the former and a shot at a first domestic trophy since 1955.

That dream, however, is dead. Alan Pardew and his players had talked of a ‘massive’ week in their season. Well, it just got bigger.

For Alan Pardew's side, Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby takes on a new dimension now they're out of the cup

The manager had, in fairness, named just about the strongest XI available to him but it looked awfully weak against a Spurs side who were superior in every department.

The against-the-odds spirit that had inspired Newcastle’s 2-0 victory at Manchester City in the last round was missing. It was, in the end, a rather timid surrender.

Apart from Moussa Sissoko, the French battering ram who tried his best to barge his team forward, the visitors offered little.

Sissoko’s compatriots Yoan Gouffran, Remy Cabella and Emmanuel Riviere — a combined £20million worth of ‘talent’ — were passengers on a journey destined to end in defeat from the moment Jak Alnwick spilled Christian Eriksen’s corner and Nabil Bentaleb looped home the opening goal.

This has been a Newcastle team characterised by resistance and resilience, neither of which was in evidence.

It was their second heavy loss in north London in five days and such drubbings will do little for the team’s confidence come Sunday.

Pardew is the only manager in Newcastle’s history to lose three in a row against their North-East rivals and, with the mitigation of a cup run gone, he can ill afford another defeat this weekend.

It was after Spurs’ fourth goal — Roberto Soldado capitalising on another Alnwick spill — that Pardew turned his attention to the derby.

The thought of going into that game without Sissoko is a frightening one and, when he took what proved to be an innocuous knock to the knee, Pardew withdrew his star man almost immediately.

His effort was recognised by the 4,200 travelling fans and they sang until the last kick of an otherwise torrid evening.

Pardew acknowledged their support but will be in doubt about how fast such goodwill would evaporate should they fail to show against Gus Poyet’s side.

The debate on radio phone-ins and in the local newspaper had been ‘which of the two matches would you prefer to win?’ Losing both was never an option.

Pardew, of course, has done tremendously well to transform his own and Newcastle’s fortunes, but the mood can change quickly on Tyneside.

After this humiliation, Pardew will be only too aware of Sunday’s significance.
