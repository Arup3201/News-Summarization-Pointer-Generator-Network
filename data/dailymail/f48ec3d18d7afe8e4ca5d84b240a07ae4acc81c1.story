The parents of a boy who died after being denied a vital hospital scan have hit out at the NHS after it emerged the delay was caused by a computer glitch.

Three-year-old Samuel Starr died in his parents’ arms after being forced to wait almost two years for a check-up which might have saved his life.

He was one of dozens of children to have their treatment needlessly delayed because of blunders at Royal United Hospital (RUH) in Bath, it is claimed.

Samuel Starr, three, died after a computer glitch meant he did not have a check-up for 20 months. He was born with a heart condition and underwent surgery when he was nine months old

Freedom of information documents 
obtained by his parents suggest there were 63 missed paediatric cardiac 
appointments at the hospital, with some taking nearly two years to 
discover.

An inquest heard 
yesterday that  Samuel was making a good recovery  following surgery 
shortly after his birth in 2010, but that regular check-ups were needed.

Samuel,
 who was born with a complex congenital cardiac defect, was supposed to 
be under the supervision of RUH staff. His parents repeatedly chased the
 hospital but a ‘glitch’ meant Samuel was left without a crucial echo 
heart scan for 20 months.

Avon Coroner Maria Voisin ruled the failure of the booking system left Samuel without examination and treatment.

She
 said: ‘This overall failure led to a five-month delay in Samuel being 
seen by his cardiologist. This meant Samuel had not been seen for five 
months and had not had an echo for 20 months.’

By
 the time he was finally seen, Samuel’s condition had dramatically 
deteriorated and he required urgent heart  surgery at Bristol Royal 
Hospital for Children.

Samuel had an operation at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and he was recovering well initially. However, his heart then began to struggle but this was not picked up because he went for so long without a check-up

Samuel
 suffered a stroke during the procedure and died a month later, in 
September 2012, in the arms of his  devastated parents, Catherine Holley
 and Paul Starr.

Yesterday the couple, from Frome in Somerset, said the NHS had ‘failed’ their son.

Mr
 Starr said: ‘It was devastating to hear that an improperly implemented 
appointments system and a series of human errors resulted in the death 
of our son.

‘We accept that
 mistakes happen but we believe that leaving a child unmonitored for as 
long as Samuel was, with so many opportunities to attend to him, goes 
beyond simple error.

‘We 
know that Samuel’s case was not an isolated one and the computer  system
 that failed him put others at risk.’

Doctors diagnosed that Samuel had a
 restricted pulmonary artery – causing blood to easily flow away from 
his heart to his lungs – during a 20-week scan in pregnancy.

After
 his first open-heart surgery in 2010, he was discharged six days later 
and referred to the Paediatric Cardiac Clinic at RUH for check-ups. 
Samuel underwent only one echocardiogram – a scan vital to monitor his 
condition – immediately after his treatment. It was left to his parents 
to chase the hospital for a further scan, but they were unable to get an
 appointment.

Medical secretary Annabelle Attridge said a ‘glitch’ with a new bookings  system meant the appointment was not logged correctly.

Samuel was due to have his check ups at Royal United Hospital, Bath, but they became sporadic. A report has suggested a new computer-based patient booking system introduced at the RUH in 2011 was to blame

Following a three-day hearing in Flax Bourton (pictured), Bristol, Avon Coroner Maria Voisin ruled the 'failure' of the booking system left Samuel without examination and treatment

Miss Holley wept as she told the inquest of her devastation when Samuel was finally operated on – and did not survive.

She said: ‘As we read Samuel his favourite stories, he died in our arms.’

The
 coroner told the inquest in Flax Bourton, North Somerset, she would not
 make any recommendations to the hospitals, because changes had already 
been made.

A spokesman for 
RUH said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to the family of Samuel, and
 are very sorry for the delay in him being seen in the specialist 
outpatient clinic.’
