Vanishing act: The 'Forest Boy' has been missing for three months but is thought to remain in Germany

German authorities will not be able to sue the 'Forest Boy' over his false claim to be an amnesiac orphan and needed expensive care - because he has vanished.

Robin van Helsum, 20, turned up out of the blue in Berlin a year ago posing as a 17-year-old who had lived in a forest with his father for years until the man suddenly died.

'Ray' told the authorities that he had lost his memory after burying his father two weeks earlier.

He then lived in the city at the taxpayer's expense for ten months, until he was exposed as a fantasist in June, when his photo was circulated around the world and he was identified by his stepmother from the Netherlands.

Van Eslum had vanished from his hometown of Hengelo only days before his arrival in Berlin.

German youth authorities confirmed they 
would sue him for at least £20,000 - the cost of his care and 
searches to find his family.

Berlin social services paid for bed and board, clothing and German lessons for the English-speaking Dutchman. They also gave him a staggering £200 a month in pocket money.

However, he has now disappeared again, and has not been seen in nearly three months.

Now neither his stepmother, his ex-girlfriend from Hengelo or the German or Dutch police know where he is.

His stepmother Ellen told a Dutch 
newspaper last week: 'A day after his unmasking he phoned me and asked 
if he could come home because he needed to rest.

f course I said yes, 
you're welcome.

'He responded with the words: "I'll call
you tomorrow or the day after."

'But I have heard nothing more.

'I was 
assuming that he would show up one day on the pavement outside, but 
nothing.'

Berlin's youth authorities believed he might have taken up with a community of
itinerant fruit pickers moving from village to village throughout the 
summer.

But that work has come to an end now autumn has arrived.

His stepmother added: 'I think he is 
still in Germany but I don't know for sure.

'There were rumours he was 
sighted in Hengelo, but Robin is smart enough to know that he would have
problems if that was the case.'

Friends said Van Helsum left home because of 'personal problems' and to 'start a new life'.

Expensive: 'Ray' was looked after for ten months after he walked into the city claiming to have lost his memory

Possessions: Van Helsum said his mother had died when he was 12 and cut contact with family and friends

Schoolmates in Hengelo, however, spotted him on the news when the pictures were published around the world. His step-mother identified him and asked him to come back home - but she has no clue where he is now

The service youth and the police of Berlin Tempelhof-Schöneberg suspect he is hiding in Berlin and its surroundings. 

A district judge in Berlin has issued a 
decree that he has to pay back the money but there is little chance of 
that happening while he remains on the run.

'We have no idea where he 
is,' said a Berlin police spokesman.

Police spokesman Michael Maass told 
Die Welt at the time: 'It was a really frustrating case and took up a 
lot of time. That will have to be paid for and that will eventually end 
up at his door.'

Accommodation: The tent which Ray was apparently using when he was in the woods

Left without a word: The house of the father of the 'forest boy Ray' in Hengelo, the Netherlands

'It's no longer a joke. If the story is made up then he deliberately took us for fools, and he could be liable for the costs.'

Berlin social services were also angry after the 20-year-old failed to apologise for the hoax.

Van Heslum said he had been living in a forest with his father Ryan for five years after his mother, Doreen, died in a car accident when he was 12 - but he insisted he did not know his last name or where he is from.

In reality, he was an illegitimate child who simply wanted to disappear off the radar and start a new life.
