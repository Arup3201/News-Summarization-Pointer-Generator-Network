Welcome back to the second installment of Male Online, my blog about the goings on in E4 TV show Made In Chelsea, mixed up with a few of my favourite things - adrenalin sports, fine-dining, travel, fashion, health, fitness, fast cars, love and romance.

This week on Made In Chelsea I have been plagued by new girlfriend syndrome – the point when your new lady-friend decides it’s time to mould you into a better man.

It starts on the little things like your wardrobe and before you know it your whole world has been turned upside down.

Young love: Spencer Matthews introduced girlfriend Stephanie Pratt this week and says he has been struck by 'new girlfriend syndrome'

And so it was the case for my new GF Stephanie Pratt, going through the Spencer Matthews Autumn/Winter 2013 collection with a hyper-critical eye.

She did it under the sub-text of needing to free up some hangers for her own clothes (I believe IKEA do them for £1 each, and I don’t think they are in short supply) but as we don't have any Swedish flat-pack furniture stores nearby in Chelsea so it was a golden opportunity for Steph to veto a few more experimental clothing items in my repertoire.

'This can just go in the trash,' she charmingly pointed out after pulling out a leather jacket with some sparkly bits on it. 'Who do you think you are? Michael Jackson, so shocking honey.'

She then placed it neatly in the charity shop pile.

For those not familiar with the world of reality TV, Stephanie Pratt was also on the TV show The Hills in America. She is blonde, leggy, stunning and is the sister of Spencer Pratt, who appeared on Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year with his wife Heidi Montag.

I met Spencer when studying at film school in Los Angeles years ago, and lived with Brody Jenner, who was also in The Hills.

So when Stephanie planned a trip over to London, Spencer Pratt asked me to look after her for him. (The fact that I was given the task of looking after a stunning blonde was the source of some amusement for many of the cast of Made In Chelsea).

In this week's MIC show there have been several outbreaks of flirtatious behaviour – Alex Mytton and Fran, Jamie and Phoebe - but it’s our love affair with fashion that I want to focus on.

Phoebe was upset at Fran moving in on her ex-boyfriend Alex and vented her displeasure at Jamie, but as she opened up her heart about the painful situation, I increasingly found myself distracted by Jamie’s holographic rainbow-coloured leopard print sleeves. I found that if you stare at them for a long time they have a slightly hypnotic effect, which I’m sure Jamie used to its full advantage.

Other inspired fashion and style moves of the show included Proudlock’s cutting edge new haircut the Top Knot, and Stevie’s bold orange jacket at Guard's polo.

The polo was also a great opportunity to show off a wonderful collection of hats (for the girls) and sunglasses. Phoebe wore an amazing oversized hat which could have been seen from space and Fran opted for a more Boho style floppy option.

As for the sunglasses, they were most often worn on top of the head as Louise did with a fabulous pair of oversized white frames, whilst Fran went for a slightly Jackie O 60's style and Cheska went for a slightly surreal pair sun protectors which appeared to have model leopards draped over the top of her frames.

I have been continuing with my psychotherapy sessions – both on-and-off air – which I’ve got to say have been increasingly productive. (BTW during my TV session last night there was a neat close of up the book Culture of Narcissism by Christopher Lasch, which was a nice touch.)

This week my therapist helped me make a major breakthrough with the realisation that the feelings I hold from my exes may not be entirely appropriate, but it’s a work in progress and I’m clearly not fixed quite yet.

One downside to the week however was that it ended up being rather expensive – I was left to pay for Louise’s bill at Benihana restaurant, admittedly after gatecrashing her dinner date with Andy.

You might be justified in saying that I deserved that one but I also managed to pick up an eye-watering bar tab at Guard’s polo. I made the schoolboy error of keeping a card behind the bar.

All my MIC chums must have heard my tab number because they all waded in and by the end of the day I practically had to take out a second mortgage to pay it off.

Love and Kisses, Spencer.
