Newcastle have expressed interest in Hamburg striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga.

The 23-year-old was a target for English clubs in the summer when he was leaving Hertha Berlin yet opted to stay in Germany.

However, despite an impressive loan spell with Hamburg last season, the permanent move has failed to work out after he scored just two goals in 16 games and the club will listen to offers.

The German side are in Dubai to play a friendly against Manchester City on Wednesday but Lasogga is unlikely to figure as he has a thigh injury.

Newcastle are also in Dubai but they have known about Lasogga's situation for a couple of weeks now and are aware interest is gathering from other Premier League sides weighing up a gamble on the Germany Under 21 international.

West Brom, Swansea and Hull have all been asked to take a closer look. His mother Kerstin acts as his agent.

Newcastle, meanwhile, are understood to be continuing talks with representatives of potential new managers with Michael Laudrup in the frame. They are also willing to let John Carver see out the season in charge if necessary.
