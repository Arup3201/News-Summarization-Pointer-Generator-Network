Stuart Pearce points out that grappling, holding and shirt-pulling in the penalty area is simply bad defending - and insists only harsh action will get rid of it.

The former left back, now Nottingham Forest manager, is adamant that until referees start awarding penalties for every single instance which ends up deciding the results of matches, the practice will never stop.

In 17 matches this season he has not seen a single penalty awarded to his side or the opposition for the offence.

Stuart Pearce believes referees must start awarding penalties to eradicate grappling in penalty areas

The issue has come to the fore once more following Manchester United's 1-1 draw against Chelsea on Sunday

Liverpool's Martin Skrtel (centre) has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking and holding

HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is Sportsmail's new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box.

Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating.

And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League.

For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that.

So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

‘It has become a part of the game at the moment,’ Pearce (right) said. ‘Part of me thinks it’s poor defending, I see players not even looking at the ball. That can’t be right.

‘We’ve got to understand when you’re holding someone in the box, it’s bad play, because you’re actually giving a penalty away.

‘The only way it will get outlawed is if the officials start giving penalties for every individual hold that there is in the box.

‘You either ignore it in both boxes, which really seems to be what’s going on at this moment in time, or alternatively you stamp down on it and you might get three or four penalties and it might decide the result of games.’ 

It was never a tactic Pearce employed as a defender. He won 78 caps for England and made more than 700 appearances in English football. The 52-year-old claims that barely any grappling and holding happened in the area when he was a player.

‘I’ve got to say when I played there wasn’t anywhere near as much grappling in this country that I’m seeing in the game at the moment,’ he explained. ‘I think we only ever really saw it on the international stage, if I’m being honest.

‘But it has come into our game and myself as a manager and a footballing person would be quite happy to see the officials stamp on it a little bit more than they are at present.

‘It’s difficult for officials. If you isolated every individual one-on-one marking situation in the box, you’d probably see three or four penalties at every corner or free kicks.’

As a manager, this is not an aspect of the game Pearce encourages amongst his own teams.

He added: ‘You certainly don’t coach your team at set plays and say just ignore the ball and grapple hold of your striker. That’s common sense. You watch the ball, you watch your man and you deal with the ball and you attempt to head it before he does if it comes into your area. It’s as simple as that.’

Pearce’s playing career spanned 24 years, starting at Wealdstone in 1978 and ending in 2002 at Manchester City. He believes this scourge on the game has been brought on by the high demands placed on players and managers to get results.

‘The game’s become very clinical in this day and age, in regards to the organisation of teams and the pressure that’s put on the teams and the managers,’ Pearce said.
