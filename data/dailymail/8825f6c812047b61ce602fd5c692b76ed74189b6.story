A 'weather map' for a distant world where it rains molten iron has been produced by scientists.

The brown dwarf Luhman 16B - technically a 'failed star' - is 6.5 light years away and the closest object of its type to the sun.

Using novel techniques to analyse its atmosphere, scientists found that Luhman 16B is surrounded by a searingly hot blanket of patchy clouds made up of droplets of liquid iron and other minerals.

The clouds have a complex structure and temperatures exceeding 1000°C.

As the object rotates, bright and dark clouds move in and out of view and alter its brightness.

Using two telescopes in Chile, the researchers mapped a layer of the clouds and reconstructed what happens at different levels of the atmosphere.

It is hoped the findings published in Nature will lead to similar observations on giant planets in distant star systems.

The learn more about the weather, researchers used a technique 
called Doppler imaging which makes use of the fact light from a star is 
slightly shifted in frequency as it rotates.

From these a rough map of 
the stellar surface was reconstructed.

Dr Ian Crossfield, of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, said: 'Previous observations have inferred brown dwarfs have mottled surfaces but now we can start to directly map them.

'What we see is presumably patchy cloud cover - somewhat like we see on Jupiter.'

The maps correspond to very rough versions of satellite weather maps of our own planet.

Dr Crossfield said: 'In future we will be able to watch cloud patterns form, evolve and dissipate - eventually maybe exo-meteorologists will be able to predict whether a visit to Luhman 16B can expect clear or cloudy skies.'

In a second study Dr Beth Biller, formerly at Max Planck and now at Edinburgh University, reconstructed what happens in different layers of the atmosphere on the brown dwarfs.

'We’ve learned the weather patterns are quite complex. The cloud structure varies quite strongly as a function of atmospheric depth and cannot be explained with a single layer of clouds,' she said.

'The exciting bit is this is only the start. With the next generations of telescopes and in particular the 39 m European Extremely Large Telescope we will likely see surface maps of more distant brown dwarfs - and eventually a surface map for a young giant planet.'

Evidence of extraterrestrial clouds covering two of the most common types of planets in our galaxy have been discovered by the Hubble telescope earlier this month.

The atmospheres were discovered by two separate teams of scientists who were analysing the climate of planets GJ 436b and GJ 1214b.

The researchers claim their work is an important milestone in characterising potentially habitable, Earth-like worlds beyond the solar system.

GJ 436b is categorised as a 'warm Neptune' because it is much closer to its star than frigid Neptune is to our sun. The planet is located 36 light-years away in the constellation Leo.

GJ 1214b, meanwhile, is known as a 'super-Earth' type planet. Super-Earths have masses between that of Earth and Neptune.

'Both planets are telling us something about the diversity of planet types that occur outside of our own solar system; in this case we are discovering we may not know them as well as we thought,' said Heather Knutson of the California Institute of Technology.

The planets can be observed passing in front of, or transiting, their parent stars. This provides an opportunity to study these planets in more detail as starlight filters through their atmospheres.
