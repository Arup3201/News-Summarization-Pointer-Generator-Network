No one could understand how Willow the cat managed to get from her home in Colorado to the streets of New York - even though she had five years to make the almost 2,000-mile journey.

But now the mystery has been solved: Willow was flown on an airplane.

A man came forward today to claim he knows the person responsible for the calico cat's magical mystery tour after a number of media outlets printed Willow's story, trying to offer an explanation as to how she could have travelled so far.

Eyes have it: How Willow got to New York, which is more than 1,600 miles away, and the kind of life she lived in the city are both mysteries

The unidentified man - who said she was renamed Molly, told Gothamist.com: 'I had Willow (aka Molly) for three months, 
while her New York owner was away for work.

'He fell in love with her on a ski 
trip when she was a stray in Colorado, and flew her back to Brooklyn, 
thinking she was too amazing to leave behind.

'She was vetted prior to flying, and none of her history came up. While 
in Brooklyn she was loved and very spoiled ... she's had quite an 
adventure, but there's no great mystery behind her travels.

'Willow is a 
lovable cat who happens to fly well. She was brought to the shelter by 
someone who loved her very much, but was unable to give her all the time
and attention she deserves.

'I'm sure her Colorado family knows how extraordinary she is, and I am so thrilled she's able to go home.'

Journey: How Willow made the distance of more than 1,600 miles from Broomfield, Colorado, to Manhattan, New York, is still a mystery

Long trip: Willow disappeared from a home in Colorado, but was found on Wednesday in New York City and will soon be reunited with her owners

A photo was posted on the website of the cat in her Brooklyn home.

Willow was found in Gramercy park 
last week and her owners were located by a microchip which was implanted
when she was a kitten.

Jamie and Chris Squires, of Boulder, Colorado, said they were 'shocked' to hear of her whereabouts.

The family, who live near the Rocky Mountains, have two of three kids and one of two dogs who may still remember Willow.

'To be honest, there are tons of 
coyotes around here, and owls,' Mrs Squires said. 'She was just a little
thing, five and a half pounds.

'We put out the "Lost Cat" posters and the Craigslist thing, but we actually thought she'd been eaten by coyotes.'

The couple were ‘astounded’ when they 
got a call from Animal Care & Control in New York City, saying she 
had been found on East 20th Street.

Mrs
Squires added that her husband told her not to tell their children 
until they were sure it was indeed Willow that had been found.

‘Then we saw the picture, and it was Willow,’ she said. ‘It's been so long.’

Animal Care & Control Executive Director Julie Bank said a scanner found the microchip that led to the Squires family.

‘All our pets are microchipped,’ Mrs Squires said. ‘If I could microchip my kids, I would.’

The
children are aged 17, 10 and 3 - so the older two remember Willow. Mrs 
Squires said her 3-year-old saw a photo and remarked: 'She's a pretty cat.’

The Squires family also have a yellow labrador named Roscoe, who knew Willow, and an English mastiff named Zoe.

‘We
had another dog back then too, and I remember Willow would lie with 
them as they all waited to be fed,’ she said. 'She thought she was a 
dog.'

Mrs Squires said Willow escaped in late 2006 or early 2007 when contractors left a door open during a home renovation.

Jamie Squires was worried about a possible New York state of mind.

'I
don't know what kind of life she's had, so I don't know what her 
personality will be like,’ she said.

She described Willow when she 
disappeared as ‘a really cool cat, really sweet’.

Since then the family had moved about 
10 miles from Broomfield to Boulder, but kept its address current with 
the microchip company.

Ms Bank recommended that all pet owners use microchips.

The ACC and the Squires family were trying to arrange for transportation back to Colorado and health certificates.

They said it might be two weeks before the reunion. Willow may spend some time with a foster family in New York.

‘The kids can't wait to see her,’ Mrs Squires said. ‘And we still have her little Christmas stocking.’
