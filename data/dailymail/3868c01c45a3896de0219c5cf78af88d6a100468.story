On returning home from their two-and-half week tour of America, Louis van Gaal’s players will not be able to complain about a lack of opportunity to impress.

As the new Manchester United manager continues to seek the best way to implement his favoured 3-5-2 formation, there are few tweaks, twists and turns that he is not prepared to try.

On Tuesday night, for example, United began this game against Inter Milan at FedExField with Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck up front. They ended it with Nani and Wilfried Zaha playing in those positions.

Ashley Young, meanwhile, played at 
both left and right wing-back as the night progressed while Luke Shaw – 
declared unfit for purpose just 24 hours ago – was given a surprise 
outing on the left during the second half.

It
 didn’t add up to much in the end. United were the more progressive team
 against an Italian side that included their former captain Nemanja 
Vidic and created the better chances. They couldn’t score, though, and 
eventually won courtesy of an immaculate penalty shootout.

With
 Young, Javier Hernandez, Tom Cleverley, Shinji Kagawa and Darren 
Fletcher making it a perfect shootout for United, Inter were overcome 
after Marco Andreolli smacked his team’s fourth kick against 
the crossbar.

Van Gaal and 
his players were perhaps vindicated for thoroughness of their 
preparation. In each of their open training sessions on this tour, they 
have practised penalties.

In
 the United coach’s mind, however, none of this will really matter. One
 gets the feeling that the Dutch veteran is simply answering questions 
in his head about his players as he goes along.

As
 he explained here on Monday night, there are certain players who are 
going to have to adapt if they are fit his system. He has decided, for 
example, that Nani, Young and the much-maligned Zaha cannot function at 
wing-back. The only chance they will have of making his team, therefore,
 will be at centre forward.

It
 would appear unlikely that any of them will in the long-term, of 
course, but at least they are being handed their auditions by their new 
manager.

Here in Maryland, 
Young actually did quite well. There was more energy about his play than
 we are used to seeing. Nani and Zaha – on the other hand – were rather 
more fitful, even if the former did come close with a couple of low 
shots in the second half and the latter had a penalty appeal turned 
down.

Certainly, United maybe should have won.

After
 a slow start that was noticeable only for a diving heard from a corner 
by Phil Jones that was saved low to his left by Samir Handanovic, United
 grew in to the game and began to threaten on the back of some effective
 midfield passing between Juan Mata and Ander Herrera in particular.

Wayne
 Rooney curled one shot over the crossbar from 20 yards while a 22-pass 
move from United in the 38th minute almost created a chance only for 
Mata’s low cross from the right to be cut out by a defender.

Mata himself then drove a shot wide from 18 yards before Van Gaal made his changes at half-time.

Certainly
 the introduction of Shaw was peculiar. The 19-year-old defender was 
training here on the pitch with United fitness coach Tony Strudwick in 
the hours leading up to the game and wasn’t even listed as a substitute 
at kick-off by United’s own website.

However, he was thrown on at half-time and went on to do reasonably well.

Zaha
 certainly looked keen as he tried to make the most of his first 
opportunity on tour and one run down the left in the 55th minute left 
two defenders floundering before Vidic of all people made ground from a 
central position to take the ball from his toe.

The
 Serbian defender was also on hand to intervene when a low Young cross 
was about to cause problems and the more Vidic went about his business 
here, the harder it was not to think he would have fitted in quite 
well in Van Gaal’s new three-man defence.

As
 it was, both Zaha and Tom Cleverley both could have been given 
penalties late on before United substitute goalkeeper David de Gea was 
called in to action with a few minutes left, diving to his left to 
spectacularly touch away a free-kick from Inter midfielder Fredy 
Guarin. 

Extra training: United boss Louis van Gaal had said earlier in the week that new signing Luke Shaw wasn't fit enough and excluded him from the squad for this match. He did take part in the warm-up however
