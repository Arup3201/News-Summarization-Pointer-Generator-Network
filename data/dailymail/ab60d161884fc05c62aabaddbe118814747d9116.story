Pat Robertson believes gay men are knowingly spreading the HIV virus while shaking hands with others using a special ring.

The host of the 700 Club and founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network made the remarks Tuesday and said attacks are most prevalent in cities like San Francisco.

Robertson said his comments were taken out of context had CBN edit them from video posted online, however footage of the former Baptist minister’s odd claims can still be viewed elsewhere on the web.

Dead serious: Pat Robertson told 700 Club viewers Tuesday that gay men intentionally spread HIV using special rings that transmit the virus during a handshake

It began with a question and answer segment.

A viewer named Mary wrote in wondering what to do after she discovered her church had her unknowingly ferrying a man dying of AIDS to and from Sunday school for weeks.

‘I feel deceived,’ Mary wrote. ‘What if there had been an accident?’

Robertson began by admitting his ignorance in matters of HIV transmission.

‘I used to think it was transmitted by saliva and other things,’ the 83-year-old said. ‘Now they say it may be sexual contact.’

Robertson’s advice to Mary was, ‘don’t have sex with him.’

‘But that’s too simplistic,’ he continued, ‘There are laws now, I think the homosexual community has put these draconian laws on the books that prohibit people from discussing this particular affliction, you can tell somebody you had a heart attack, you can tell them they’ve got high blood pressure, but you can’t tell anybody you’ve got AIDS.’

This last remark and those that followed were edited from the video posted to CBN’s website and the YouTube videos of the full exchange that surfaced were promptly taken down on copyright claims.

However, Huffington Post’s video of the broadcast remains viewable.

‘You know what they do in San Francisco, some in the gay community there they want to get people so if they got the stuff they’ll have a ring, you shake hands, and the ring’s got a little thing where you cut your finger,’ Robertson said. ‘Really. It’s that kind of vicious stuff, which would be the equivalent of murder.’

Robertson later claimed that what he meant was gays from ‘years ago,’, not gays today.

‘Our organization sponsored a meeting years ago in San Francisco where trained security officers warned me about shaking hands,’ he told the Atlantic Wire. ‘In those days, certain AIDS-infected activists were deliberately trying to infect people like me by virtue of rings which would cut fingers and transfer blood.’
