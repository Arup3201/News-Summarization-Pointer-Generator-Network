Manchester City's Mr Versatile, James Milner, is hopeful there will be a breakthrough in his contract stalemate with the Premier League champions but is refusing to let the issue distract him on the pitch.

The England midfielder has emphasised his importance to City by playing as an emergency striker in the past two games after their entire front-line were wiped out through injury.

City are anxious for Milner to agree a four-and-a-half year extension to his current deal, which runs out at the end of the season, with Liverpool understood to be among the clubs ready to sign him on a free transfer if he decides to leave the Etihad after five years.

Milner turns 29 a week on Sunday and despite making a significant contribution this season, he is known to be concerned over his first-team opportunities once City’s injury problems ease.

Contract talks have stalled in the past two weeks but Milner is determined to stay focused as City strive to defend their title.

‘I hope it will be sorted,’ he said. ‘We’re still in talks. I’m waiting for the club to come back and hopefully they will soon. 

'But the main thing is to concentrate on football, there are so many games coming up.

‘If I’m not doing my job on the field because of off-the-field stuff then that’s no good. So I let others take care of it and I just concentrate on football.’

With Stevan Jovetic returning from injury on the bench at West Brom on Boxing Day, Milner’s short stint up front may come to an end at home to Burnley on Sunday.

The former Newcastle and Aston Villa midfielder has played seven different positions in his City career, and Milner revealed that it could have been eight after he nearly replaced goalkeeper Joe Hart on one occasion.

‘It was different playing up front,’ he added. ‘I haven’t played there for a while and I enjoyed it.

‘I played centre-back in a pre-season friendly. I nearly went in goal once when Joe got injured but he played on in the end. The team comes first and whatever you need to do...’

Manuel Pellegrini’s side have an ideal opportunity to extend a nine-game winning run in all competitions as they complete their Christmas programme with home games against Burnley and Sunderland. 

And having twice won League titles with City on the final day of the season, Milner warned that they are ready to push Chelsea all the way to the finishing line.

‘Experience of winning it always helps,’ he said. ‘You know what went wrong and you try to put it right. Winning titles on the last day means we know how long it is. 

'People have been writing us off, saying Chelsea have it won already. They are a strong team but we will fight them all the way for it.

‘It’s nice to know what it’s all about, to know you’ve got over the line before.

‘The fact not many teams have won back-to-back titles shows how difficult it is to do it. Hopefully we are making a better fist of it with the fact we’re still in there.’

Pellegrini confirmed strikers Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero are the only City players unavailable for Burnley’s visit to the Etihad.

‘Edin and Sergio are out for the game but all of the other players are available,’ he said.

The Chilean has been forced to shuffle his pack considerably in the pair’s absence, with Jovetic only returning from injury on Boxing Day, too.

Milner has been employed as a false nine, while 18-year-old Spanish forward Jose Pozo led the City line in their 1-0 win against Leicester on December 13.

‘It was a very difficult situation. It is not normal to have three strikers injured but I think we have intelligent players, we changed our style of play.

‘And we now have more possession of the ball so we have time to arrive for the second balls inside the box and they are scoring.’

Manchester City have twice won the title on the last day of the season - the latest coming in May 2014

On Milner’s reinvention as a centre forward, Pellegrini added: ‘I’m very pleased as he is a very intelligent player, maybe not the normal striker we are used to, but he works very hard to work the space.’

City host a Burnley side on Sunday afternoon that sit 19th in the Barclays Premier League table, however there are five points between Sean Dyche’s team and basement club Leicester.

‘I think it will be a very tough game,’ said Pellegrini. ‘It doesn’t matter that they are in the last three positions of the table.

‘They have good players. I hope we start the game with the attitude that we have to win three points. If we think we are going to have an easy game that would be a big mistake.’

Fernando, City’s £12million summer signing from Porto, was delighted to open the scoring in the 3-1 win at West Brom, in which City went three up in 36 minutes, seeing the game out amid a snowstorm.

‘Yes, it was my first goal,’ the Brazilian midfielder said. ‘I am very happy to help the team win. It was an excellent first goal. We needed this win.

‘I wasn’t expecting the snow. It snowed a lot. It worked against us in the second half. But we stayed together. We are in a good run and hopefully we keep winning games.’
