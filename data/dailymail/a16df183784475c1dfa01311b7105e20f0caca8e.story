Burger King has launched 'diet chips' in a bid to target health conscious consumers.

The fast-food chain says the new 'Satisfries', as they are called, contain 30 per cent less fat than standard fries.

The UK and Ireland launch comes just six months after the lower fat fries were introduced in the U.S. and Canada.

'Healthy option': The new Burger King 'Satisfries'
 (left) are said to have 30 per cent less fat than regular fries. A
 small portion of regular Burger King fries (right) contains 222 
calories, while Satisfries have 214

The company has worked with chip producer McCain to develop a new coating to block out more vegetable oil during frying.

'We will offer our guests a
 new fat-reduced option without compromising on taste,' said Bianca 
Shen, VP Marketing and Communications, Europe, Middle East & 
Africa, in a statement.

'Insight shows that guests are increasingly looking for reduced fat products... and Satisfries are the  first French fries to offer guests a reduced fat option.

'The difference is that the Satisfries recipe ensures that the 
 French fries absorb less fat during frying – offering a great tasting 
French fry that is crispy on the  outside and fluffy on the  nside.'

Yet some would argue it was barely worth swapping - a small portion of Satisfries has just eight fewer calories than standard one, with 214 rather than 222

Burger King has been trying to revamp its image in recent years, adding choices like cranberry apple salads and mango smoothies to its menus.

The fries – which will cost up to 20p more – will be made in the same fryers and cooked for the same length of time.

But
 executives refuse to say how ingredients in the oil-repellant  recipe 
have changed and insist McCain will not supply the ‘diet’ chips to any 
other fast-food chain.

Burger
 King insists the secret ingredient is so effective it cuts calories 
even though the new shape means there is a larger surface area for each 
fry.

The new chips will be available in 1,800 outlets, priced from £1.39.

Last year McDonalds released a yolk-free version of its Egg McMuffin as a 'healthy option' in the U.S.

The Egg White Delight is made with a wholegrain muffin and contains 260 calories compared to the 300 in a regular Egg McMuffin.

The move was intended to address criticism that fast food chains contribute to rising obesity rates.

How the different types of Burger King chips compare

When the lower fat fries launched in the U.S., MailOnline staff there performed a taste test...

'The full-fat fries definitely have more flavor than the new 
low-calorie option,' said one online journalist, who decided to stick 
with the regular version despite its 340 calories.

'I know it 
isn’t good for you but when you’re going for fast food fries, you have 
to go all out and get the full effect by having them loaded up with salt
 and grease,' she added.

A senior editor agreed. 'The crinkly 
don’t hold a candle to the regular. If they were 50 per cent fewer 
calories they MAY be worth eating, but they are no substitute. Also they
 are not salty enough,' she said.

Another reporter, who believes 
Burger King 'has always had the worst fast food French fries,' thinks 
the new low-calorie option is 'even worse'.

'They have a more 
potato-y flavour, but not in a good way. They are mushy and soggy on the
 inside and pale and limp on the outside,' he said. 'And who really 
wants to save calories at Burger King, anyway?'
