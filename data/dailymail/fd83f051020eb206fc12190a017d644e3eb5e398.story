John Travolta's former pilot has hit out at the Saturday Night Fever star for accusing him of 'wanting money' in a pending lawsuit between the pair.

Doug Gotterba - who claims he had a six-year gay affair with Travolta when he worked for him in the 1980s - released a statement to MailOnline refuting Travolta's comments.

In an interview with The Daily Beast this week Travolta, 60, was asked about the pending lawsuit with Gotterba, to which he replied: 'This is every celebrity's achilles heel. It's just about people wanting money. That's all. It happens on many levels.'

Lawsuit pending: Douglas Gotterba has sued superstar JohnTravolta to determine if a confidentiality agreement covering his employment was valid. Gotterba wants to write a book

Responding to Travolta's comments, Gotterba said: 'What John Travolta said about me in a recent 
interview is an inaccurate description of what our court case is about.

'Our dispute is purely about declaratory relief and will be a non-monetary judgement. This is about the truth and my right for a court to decide who is telling the truth, not for Mr Travolta to make a judgement.'

However, MailOnline has learned that according to Travolta's representative, Gotterba had asked for $10 million to settle the case out of court.

Gotterba was a pilot for Travolta's aircraft company Alto for six years before leaving voluntarily in 1987.

The
 former pilot alleges he and Travolta enjoyed a sexual relationship when
 he was under his employment and the pair are currently disputing 
whether Gotterba signed a confidentiality agreement.

Last July, a California appeals court ruled that Gotterba would be able to argue his case that he does not have a confidentiality agreement with Travolta.

When Gotterba left the actor's Alto airline company in 1987, he entered into a written termination agreement.

Gotterba decided to 'tell the story of his life and those involved in it', including his personal relationship with Travolta after he was 'unwillingly thrust' into the spotlight when another former Travolta employee spilled the beans about their purported gay relationship.

When Travolta’s attorney learned that 
Gotterba was planning to write a book, the pilot was warned that he would
 be breaching a confidentiality provision of the termination agreement. 
But the pilot asserted the agreement was ‘not authentic.’ It was an 
earlier draft that he did not agree to, he said.

He
 filed suit against Travolta, asking the court to decide about the 
validity of the agreement and the validity of the confidentiality 
clause.

Speaking about the fact he has been subject to several allegations from supposed former lovers in the past, Travolta
 told the Daily Beast: 'Also, I don't care that much about it. Other 
people may attack it back more than I do, but I let all the media stuff 
go a long time ago because I can't control it I think that's why it 
persists, to some degree.'

The star was dogged by gay rumors two years ago when an anonymous masseur sued him claiming sexual assault and battery and another masseur joined the lawsuit.

Both lawsuits were ultimately dropped by the masseurs.

Travolta said he has come to terms with being the target of such allegations.

'Also, I don't care that much about it. Other people may attack it back more than I do, but I let all the media stuff go a long time ago because I can't control it. I think that's why it persists to some degree,' the actor said.

Travolta's autistic teenage son Jett died in 2009 after suffering a seizure while on a Christmas vacation in The Bahamas and the star said he was disturbed by some of the media coverage.

'I found it most offensive with the 
loss of my son. I felt like that was the lowest I'd ever felt. Sex stuff
 is always going to be interesting to somebody, but you stay away from 
family. You really should. With that, I always felt like the media - not
 all of the media, but part of it - went too low there,' he said.

The Pulp Fiction star opened up while at the Toronto International Film Festival for his new film The Forger.

He
 portrays a second-generation art forger who agrees to take on a job 
with his father, played by 84-year-old Christopher Plummer, in order to 
spend time with his dying son.
