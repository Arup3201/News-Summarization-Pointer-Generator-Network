An Ohio teenager died last month just days before he was set to graduate high school because of a caffeine overdose.

Logan Stiner, 18, died on May 27 in his family's LaGrange home.

Stiner's autopsy showed his blood contained over 70 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of blood, Lorain County Coroner Dr. Stephen Evans told the Chronicle-Telegram - though only fifty micrograms of caffeine per milliliter is lethal.

Victim: Logan Stiner, pictured, died from a lethal caffeine overdose

Energy drinks, Evans said, contain a much lower amount - usually contain three to fifteen micrograms. 

'He was a young, healthy guy,' he said. 'People don’t realize [caffeine] could potentially kill you.'

Evans said Stiner did not suffer from any cardiac conditions.

He told the Chronicle-Telegram the caffeine powder caused Stiner to suffer cardiac arrythmia and a seizure and killed him.

'I think [caffeine powder] is dangerous,' he said.  'I didn’t realize it was sold in bulk over the Internet.'

Stiner was a student at Keystone High School and member of the wrestling team.

Deadly: Authorities found the blood of Logan Stiner, right, contained 70 micrograms of caffeine per milliliter of blood - 20 micrograms higher than a lethal dose

Stiner's mother Katie told the 
Chronicle-Telegram she found caffeine powder bags in the family's home 
the day Logan died - but that she didn't even know he was using it.

However, she said Logan told her he had been taking a 'pre-workout' mix.

'He had no clue what he was doing,' Katie Stiner said. 'We talked about everything.'

Katie Stiner told the paper she has been mourning her son's death for the last month.

'It’s been a month today and I don’t even know where the time went,' she said.

'Logan was at the height of his game in life.'

Stiner, who won prom king earlier this year, was remembered at Keystone High School's graduation ceremony, Fox8 reported. A moment of silence was held and students released balloons into the air.
