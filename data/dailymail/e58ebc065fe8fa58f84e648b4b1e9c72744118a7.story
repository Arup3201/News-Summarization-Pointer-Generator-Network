She has come a long way from her days as a Little Black Dress-clad Spice Girl.

Now Victoria Beckham has made the transition to globally respected fashion designer, silencing her critics  by launching a hugely successful brand loved by A-listers and fashion editors alike. 

The mother-of-four unveiled her AW15 collection at New York Fashion Week on Sunday to a stellar front row, including husband David and their sons Brooklyn, 15, Romeo, 12, Cruz, nine, and daughter Harper, three, sitting alongside Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, and stylist Rachel Zoe.

Shunning the trend for overexposure, currently championed by the likes of Kim Kardashian, Miley Cyrus and Miranda Kerr, Victoria's range was a much more modest affair.

Her designs were full of cream midi skirts, voluminous knits and calf-scraping culottes - proving that more really is more - in a sophisticated neutral palette of cream, taupe, black and navy. 

Following her footwear debut last season, Mrs Beckham designed the shoes too, with calf-length boots in black and beige featuring a substantial heel.

The entire collection went down a storm with Vogue's most esteemed fashion editors.

Victoria's chunky knits and midi skirt ensembles that barely revealed an inch of flesh have been hailed as 'the new kind of sexy'

Shunning the trend for overexposure loved on all the red carpets, Victoria's sophisticated and feminine collection still won plaudits 

Last year,  the fashion bible hinted that Victoria's collection was reminiscent of the stuff they had seen on the Celine runway  before and commented that they'd like to see a 'bit more of her' in her designs.

It seems she took note. With a new direction, 40-year-old Victoria's stand-out designs, which are clearly based on her own wardrobe, winning her plaudits.

'This was a sexy and sophisticated take that put shape at its centre for soft and womanly silhouettes,' wrote Vogue's Jessica Bumpus.

Legendary Vogue International Editor, Suzy Menkes OBE, added: 'Bringing back sexy - a slither of flesh at the waist or a jigsaw of fabrics forming five shades of black - was only a sidebar to the main story: Victoria Beckham has made it as a designer.

'I can’t think of another celebrity who has been willing and able to create a unique style.'

In her show notes, Mrs Beckham explained 'it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel.' 

The creative process for this collection was an altogether different style. Mrs Beckham explains how she decided to start with her classic designs and re-imagine them for a new season.

'I began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it,' she wrote. 'It was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process.

'Familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked. Volumes have been subverted, menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists, spirals, seams and asymmetry interplayed. Fabrics bounce and move, a swing is sculptural, and a more body conscious silhouette emerges...

'For me it is a collection full of possibilities.' 

Commenting on her range, The Telegraph's Ellie Pithers wrote: 'Equally successful were the mannish double-breasted navy cocoon coats with neat horn buttons; the herringbone coat with a bustle at the hip; the chunky cream and navy sweaters with ballooning sleeves; and the skirt made out of cream velvet bows - VB's answer to the "modern day red carpet" conundrum when worn with a simple chenille sweater.

Victoria Beckham seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this collection, with patent boots and luxurious coats 

Victoria's collection went down a storm on social media with fashion editors such as Jo Ellison, right, hailing it as 'sexy'

'Sure, it's not a problem that vexes most of us, but she's got all her bases covered.'

Fashion website WWD described the collection as 'a study in calm sexiness' and insisted plenty of women will be climbing over each other to wear it come autumn.  

This is the latest in a string of stylish hits for the star, who last year opened the doors to her flagship store on Dover Street. 

Then, she beat fashion powerhouse Alexander McQueen, a label loved by the Duchess of Cambridge, as well as her friend Stella McCartney for the prestigious title of Best Brand at the British Fashion Awards 2014. 

'Whatever fashion people say about “Team VB” doing all the work, added Suzy Menkes. 'I believe that the foundation and flow of this collection could have come only from her.'
