Secret recorded video of two New Jersey realtors kinky 'sexual escapades' inside a house they were supposed to be selling has been released today by the irate owner who claims they used his home like 'a cheap motel'.

The revealing footage of Coldwell Banker realtors Robert Lindsay and Jeannemarie Phelan comes as homeowners, Richard and Sandra Weiner sue the pair for damages, claiming they were promised the house would sell for $650,000.

According to Weiner, his home security cameras recorded affectionate Phelan and Lindsay having sex at least 10 times - including on his marital bed - and he claims the realtors listed his home above market value so that they could use the house for their lurid affair.

Caught: Robert Lindsay and Jeannemarie Phelan are believed to be pictured here after meeting at the New Jersey home of Richard and Sandra Weiner

Snippets of the sensational footage aired for the first time on Inside Edition as an angry Weiner hit back at the $1 million counter-suit launched by Lindsay and Phelan which alleges the Weiners tried to blackmail them with the footage.

But Richard Weiner claims this is not true, telling Inside Edition: 'We didnâ€™t ask them for a cent. We asked them for a meeting.'

Jeannemarie Phelan's attorney said, 'I have never seen a more exaggerated claim in 48 years of practice.'

Hal Maxwell, president of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in New Jersey, told Inside Edition in a statement,

'The alleged misconduct at the home does not in any way represent how we conduct business as a company and that immediately after learning of the allegation of improper behavior the company ceased affiliation with the agents.'

The Weiners also claim Lindsay, a former Passaic County Board of Realtors president, made a duplicate key and intentionally over-priced the home to discourage buyers from December 2011 to January 2012.

NorthJersey.com reports the couple is suing both Lindsay and Phelan for committing the 'ultimate breach of trust' and Coldwell for violating the realtor code of ethics.

According to the suit filed on December 6, the Weiners began working with Lindsay and Coldwell in early 2010 when Lindsay repeatedly told them the Wayne home would sell for $650,000.

The couple contracted him to list it in December 2011.

That's when the trouble allegedly began.

On December 27, 2011, security cameras allegedly captured the agents hugging and kissing in the kitchen before undressing and having sex on the Weiners' bed.

The suit says footage shows the pair allegedly hooking up many more times until they were busted by cops on January 23, 2012.

'Sandra Weiner happened to be checking the video cameras feed at the time and saw strange people in the house with what she thought were flashlights,' the suit states.

'The house was dark at the time. The Weiners called the local police, who then went to the house.

'The police opened the door to the house and found Lindsay pulling up his pants. Lindsay lied to police by telling them that he was there to prepare the house for an open house.

'Instead, Lindsay and Phelan were at the house to have sex.'

Richard and Sandra Weiner, claim the agents deliberately steered away potential buyers so they could use the house for their 'sexual escapades'

After watching the footage, the Weiners claim 'they could no longer use the bedroom or the remainder of the house' and 'were uncomfortable and disgusted even being in their house, UPI reports.

The suit accuses Coldwell of violating the Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice of the National Association of Realtors, which requires that 'shall not deliberately mislead the owner as to the market value.'

Hal Maxwell, president of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in New Jersey, told NorthJersey.com the company no longer works with Lindsay or Phelan.

'Immediately after learning of the allegation of improper behavior at the property by two independent contractors in January 2012, we ceased our affiliation with the agents,' he said.

'These agents have not listed or sold properties on our behalf since the allegation of misconduct at the home was first reported.'

The Weiners are seeking compensatory damages for invasion of privacy, infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, trespass of land and other civil counts.
