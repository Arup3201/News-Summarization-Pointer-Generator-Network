Joe Barlow, from Laindon, Essex, was jailed for five separate offences at Basildon Crown Court, including stealing £8,500 from his grandparents

A 20-year-old fugitive who taunted police on Facebook by posting ‘can’t catch me’ wept in the dock as he was jailed for stealing thousands of pounds from his grandparents and assaulting his mother.

Joe Barlow, from Laindon, Essex, was jailed for five separate offences at Basildon Crown Court, including stealing £8,500 from his grandparents’ savings to pay for drugs.

He was sent to prison after spending two and a half months on the run from police before his arrest 12 miles from his home in Stondon Massey, Essex.

He was jailed for eight months for five separate offences including assaulting his mother in February and breaching a suspended sentence he was handed in March 2012.

He was given the suspended sentence after he went to his grandparents’ home and took cash they had been saving to get their windows replaced before fleeing to Cornwall to spend it.

Earlier this year, Barlow also admitted assaulting his mother on Valentine’s Day and an offence of criminal damage at Basildon Magistrates’ Court.

His case was sent to Basildon Crown Court for sentence on March 26 but he didn’t turn up and the court issued a warrant for his arrest.

Essex Police posted his mugshot on its Facebook page on May 3, with an urgent appeal for members of the public to report sightings of him.

Hours later Barlow began his online taunts, writing: ‘Can’t catch me’, and said he would not turn himself in until he had a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron.

But he was arrested a short time later at a hideout in Stondon Massey, Essex, he was again ordered to attend court.

Barlow, who wore a red prison-issue tracksuit for the court appearance, sobbed throughout the hearing as his mother and girlfriend sat in the public gallery.

His solicitor, Mark Savage, said his time on the run stemmed from a fear of court and going to prison.

He said he committed a number of offences while in a ‘toxic relationship’ with an ex-partner.

He said: ‘This young man is clearly distressed at being back in front of the court.

‘This is not a man coming to court swaggering with bravado and his mother is here at court to support him.’

The court heard Barlow has a string of previous convictions for battery, destroying property and common assault.

Sentencing, Recorder Tim Clark said: ‘You are clearly an unstable young man who has a bad criminal record.

‘You continue to commit criminal offences which are aggravated by the fact the victims are members of your own family.

‘You are fortunate still to have the support of your family.

‘You cannot just not appear at court and put your head in the sand as an act of fear.’

He was jailed for eight months for common assault, criminal damage, breaching a suspended sentence order, committing an offence while subject to a suspended sentence order and failing to appear at court.
