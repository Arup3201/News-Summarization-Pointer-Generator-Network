Human evolution was driven by short, rapid waves of climate change.

This is according to researchers studying cone-shaped deposits of sediment in southeast Arabia that provide a 160,000 year record of the area's climate.

The deposits reveal that our early human ancestors left Africa on a journey to southern Asia around 75,000 to 130,000 years ago, during multiple phases.

The find contradicts another theory that claims human populations expanded rapidly from Africa to southern Asia via the coastlines of Arabia around 50,000 to 60,000 years ago.

The sediments reveal a period of increased rainfall, which scientists at Oxford University argue would have provided sufficient freshwater to support expanding populations.

'The dispersal of early human populations out of Africa is dynamically linked with the changing climate and environmental conditions of Arabia,' said Professor Ash Parton at Oxford University.

'Although now arid, at times the vast Arabian deserts were transformed into landscapes littered with freshwater lakes and active river systems.

The sediments – also known as alluvial fans - were found along the Western Haja in Al Sibetah, Oman. Pictured is a stock image of alluvial fan deposits

'Such episodes of dramatically increased rainfall were the result of the intensification and northward displacement of the Indian Ocean Monsoon, which caused rainfall to reach across much of the Arabian Peninsula.'

The sediments – also known as alluvial fans - were found along the Western Haja in Al Sibetah, Oman.

A previous study by University College London argued that the waxing and waning of huge lakes in the East African Rift valley was linked to the brain expansion of early human species.

Professor Mark Maslin, co-author of the study, said at the time: 'It seems modern humans were born from climate change.

'They had to deal with rapid switching from famine to feast - and back again - which drove the appearance of new species with bigger brains and also pushed them out of East Africa into Eurasia and South Africa.'

Long ago, humans left their evolutionary cradle in Africa and passed through the Middle East on their way to Europe. 

And in January, scientists found the first fossil remains that appear to document that journey, a partial skull from an Israeli cave.

The skull dates from around 55,000 years ago, fitting into the period when scientists had thought the migrants inhabited the area. 

And details of its anatomy resemble ancient skulls from Europe, Israel Hershkovitz of Tel Aviv University in Israel wrote in an email.

The skull, which lacks facial features and its base, was found in Manot Cave in the Galilee region of northern Israel.

The migrants are called modern humans because of their anatomy. The earliest remains of modern humans in Europe date to about 45,000 years ago.

They did so in multiple phases as a result of rapid bursts of rainfall

This contradicts theory they left all at once around 50,000 years ago
