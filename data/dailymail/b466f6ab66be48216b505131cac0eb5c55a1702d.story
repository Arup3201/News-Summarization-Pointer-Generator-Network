Roger Federer strolled on to a Centre Court that felt more like the venue for a  wake than a rocking sports arena, the crowd still reeling from seeing Andy Murray’s demise.

It was a more muted  reception than the seven-time  champion has become accustomed to and he offered little to immediately restore order, dropping the first set to fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka in 30 minutes.

But Federer was unruffled, smoothing a crease from his shirt and running a hand through his hair before grinding out the second set and  powering to a 3-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory. At the net he embraced his good friend and stopped to sign autographs as he left.

Federer looked more like a man who had enjoyed a brisk walk in the park than a 2hr 55min slog on the lawn. He now faces his 35th Grand Slam semi-final and his ninth at SW19.

Rather ominously for Friday’s opponent, 23-year-old Milos Raonic, he has gone on to reach the final on all but one of those occasions and the only time he has lost on the second Sunday at the All England Club was to Rafael Nadal in a 2008 epic.

‘It’s a comfortable place to be,’ said Federer. ‘You know there is a chance now to go a step further because you trust your game and you’ve been there before so many times.’

The 32-year-old has won all  four confrontations with big-serving Canadian Raonic, most recently at the Australian Open this year.

Raonic is one of an emerging group challenging the Big Four along with Grigor Dimitrov,  Kei Nishikori and Nick Kyrgios. Nadal and Murray have already fallen to this thrusting talent.

‘It’s exciting to see new faces,’ said Federer. ‘We still don’t have enough teenagers. It’s just hard breaking through for a youngster to win or be consistent over five matches in a row and get those ranking points.’

Classy: He lost the first set, but the king of grass looked his usual self thereafter

Federer’s progress has been so imperious that it was not until the fourth game of yesterday’s match — 6hr 9min into his title challenge — that his serve was broken for the first time.

Wawrinka converted the second and sealed the first set with a supersonic forehand.

He maintained his level in the second set, taking Federer to a tiebreak. But even as he ages Federer retains a magic touch and a beautiful volley set him up to take the set.

Wawrinka was reduced to a shell of a man thereafter and later admitted to being exhausted after playing for the third consecutive day.

Controversial scheduling meant his third-round match against Denis Istomin was held over from Friday to Monday.

‘It was tough to play three days in a row, especially when I played the third against Roger,’ said Wawrinka. ‘It cost me a lot of energy but Roger deserved to win.’

Support: Mirka Federer watches on from the box on Centre Court

Federer does not only have a youngster to deal with on court tomorrow but four more at home. He admitted to struggling to balance looking after his two sets of twins — five-year-old girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva and two-month-old boys Leo and Lenny.

‘I need to be on the same wavelength with my wife (Mirka) on how we raise our kids,’ Federer said. ‘They sleep much better now (but) the daytimes are very busy.’

Federer’s only real grumble was directed at the All England Club, who rigorously enforced their all-white outfit rule.

‘It’s too strict,’ he said. ‘If you look at the pictures of Edberg, Becker ... there was some  colours. But I respect. Maybe one day they’ll loosen the grip.’
