Wikileaks founder Julian Assange gave a rambling press conference yesterday claiming he would leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London ‘soon’ after two years inside.

He complained about the difficulty of living in a small room in the imposing six-storey townhouse and claimed his human rights had been violated. The 43-year-old  Australian added: ‘I can confirm I will be leaving the embassy soon.’

Assange is fighting extradition to Sweden where he is accused of rape, which he denies. He will be arrested if he leaves the building in Knightsbridge where police have been stationed outside round the clock since he arrived in June 2012.

The constant watch is thought to have cost taxpayers at least £7million so far. There were at least 20 officers outside the embassy yesterday.

Press conference: Julian Assange spoke at the Ecuadorian embassy today where he said he would leave 'soon' after two years there

Message: In a monologue Assange said he was 'imprisoned' in the embassy but denied problems with his health is the reason for wanting to leave

During the 
press conference Assange thanked the Government for making changes to 
extradition laws that allow those who have not been charged to remain at
 liberty.

He
 suggested Parliament had changed the law because of the ‘abuses of my
 rights’. But the Home Office said the changes would not apply 
retrospectively.

A
 spokesman said his case would be dealt with under the law as it stood 
when Sweden issued the European Arrest Warrant in 2010, when there was 
no requirement for prosecutors to have taken a charging decision before 
completing the paperwork.

Julian Assange's failing health looks likely to end his two year stay in the Ecuadorian embassy.

Assange
 is, according to a WikiLeaks source, suffering from the potentially 
life-threatening heart condition arrhythmia and has a chronic lung 
complaint and dangerously high blood pressure.

A
 severe shortage of Vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin, is impacting on his
 general health – in the long term, it can trigger asthma and diabetes, 
weaken bones and increase the risk of dementia.

The
 Ecuadorians have asked permission to take him to hospital – using a 
diplomatic car as an ambulance if the need arises – but it’s a request 
the Foreign Office has declined to answer.

In
 the meantime, he works out with a former SAS veteran who acts as his 
personal trainer and plays football alone in the embassy corridor in an 
effort to keep flexible.

He 
is thought to have stood in direct sunlight for only about 20 minutes 
during his incarceration, when he emerged on the balcony to address his 
supporters in August 2012.

He has a specially adapted lamp to mimic sunlight in his room — which measures just 15ft by 13ft.

Near a Victorian fireplace he has a 
treadmill donated by the Left-wing film-maker Ken Loach and in his first
 year at the embassy he notched up 744 miles on the running machine.

There has been speculation that Assange was planning to leave the embassy to seek hospital treatment.

He
 has been reported to be suffering from vitamin D deficiency due to a 
lack of sunlight, a chronic lung complaint because of life without fresh
 air, and arrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of the 
heartbeat. Assange said living inside a small room in a building that 
had no outside area would affect any ‘healthy person’.

‘The United Nations minimum standard for prisoners is one hour a day of outside exercise,’ he said.

Even when I was in Wandsworth prison in solitary confinement, that was respected.’

All change: The fugitive Australian WikiLeaks founder will give a news conference from his London hideout at 9am and may announce his intention to leave

But
 he said he was emerging for other reasons, although he did not say what
 these were. However, as the day wore on it became clear that the press 
conference had been a publicity stunt, with his representatives saying 
he would not be leaving while the extradition order remained.

His
 spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said Assange had no intention of handing 
himself over to the police and could only leave if the British 
Government ‘calls off the siege outside’.

Assange
 claims that if he is extradited to Sweden he will be sent on to the US 
where he could be tried for the largest information leak in the 
country’s history. WikiLeaks began releasing thousands of confidential 
US documents on the internet in 2010.

He walked into the Ecuadorean embassy on June 19, 2012, and was granted political asylum two months later.

He
 said he had been detained for four years, having spent time in prison 
and under house arrest before retreating to the embassy. Last week he 
lost a legal bid to have the arrest warrant against him cancelled.

Ecuador’s
 foreign minister Ricardo Patino said yesterday: ‘It is time to free 
Julian Assange. It is time for his human rights to be finally 
respected.’

He added: ‘Ecuador is obligated to protect Julian Assange in our embassy until he can fully enjoy his right to asylum.’

The Ecuador government said it wanted a meeting with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond to discuss freeing Assange.

The
 Foreign Office said he would be extradited if he left the embassy. ‘As 
ever we look to Ecuador to help bring this difficult, and costly, 
situation to an end,’ a spokesman said.
