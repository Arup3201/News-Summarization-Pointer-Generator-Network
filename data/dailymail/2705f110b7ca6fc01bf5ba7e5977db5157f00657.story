A determined tuna fish has made a marathon journey of nearly 4,000 miles from Spain to Venezuela.

Fishermen, working in partnership with researchers and scientists at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, tagged the Bonito Tuna while they were working off the coast of Spain near to the Spanish city of San Sebastian in 2006.

But they were shocked to find it has been found off the coast of Venezuela, South America, some seven years and 3,958 miles later.Â 

Mammoth journey: The tuna swam for seven years to make the huge trip

The tuna had doubled in size from 19.7 inches to 39 inches during the voyage, The Local reports.

It had also piled on the pounds going from weighing 5.5lb in 2006 to 48lb when it was recaptured after its trans-Atlantic journey.

Experts at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas say this is a record journey for the species.

A red tuna, caught by a fisherman in Massachusetts, US, in 2007, had travelled 3,833 miles.

Since 2001, Spanish fishermen have worked with governments, fishing association and researchers to study Atlantic fish.

Tuna migrate south annually either to mate or follow food sources.

Scientists have been tagging and studying fish for years in an effort to make sure there is enough tuna stocks around the world to meet commercial demand.

There are five fishing bodies across the globe, including the  International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas which work to prevent overfishing and preserve different species.
