Arsenal and Galatasaray will face UEFA charges following the behaviour of the Turkish fans at the Emirates Stadium on Wednesday night.

The Gunners will be charged because they were responsible for security and organisation at the stadium, and are likely to face a fine for 'insufficient organisation'.

Galatasaray have been charged with the conduct of their supporters, a more serious charge, which could result in the partial closure of their ground for future Champions League games. 

Sportsmail understands that Galatasaray fans were issued 3,000 tickets for the match and trouble started when around 500 Turkish supporters  let off flares as they marched to the ground.

Although 12 flares were confiscated at the turnstiles, fans managed to smuggle more into the ground - causing a disturbance when they were thrown on to the pitch during  the first half of Arsenal’s 4-1 win..

A fire steward was hit by a flare and Sportsmail also understands that Arsenal fans were pelted with coins and bottles, while over 100 seats at the stadium were damaged.

'There were also some flares thrown near to the Tollington Arms on Hornsey Road.
