And after posting pictures of his extraordinary ideas on the internet he was encouraged to put his ideas in recipe books.

His first, Funky Lunch, proved a huge hit with parents and children alike when it launched in 2009.

Recipes were made up of the least popular food items among children - including tomatoes and cucumber.

Incredibly, he managed to fashion a grand piano and a crocodile out of the vegetables.

Tomatoes and cucumbers have also been made to look irresistible to kids after being transformed in to a flying saucers.

And the ‘Monster Burger’ aims to get youngsters eating red peppers, which are cleverly disguised as the characters horns.

Mr Northeast, who lives with wife Lisa, 38, in Littlehampton, West Sussex, said: 'It all started because Oscar was a bit grumpy one day and he didn’t want to eat.

'The options were to let him starve, trying to force something down or making something he would eat.

Mark Northeast's children have inspired him to create the fun food and share it with the public

'So I decided to make a sandwich and made it in to a space rocket - he ate it instantly.

'By doing this I was able to get him to eat things he usually wouldn’t - like tomatoes.

'I made a SpongeBob Squarepants sandwich with a tomato for a tie.

'Oscar didn’t want to eat it but I said if he didn’t he couldn’t eat the rest so he did and now he eats tomatoes.

'To
 begin with it was purely just a bit of fun. I had a creative background
 and an interest in food so I started playing around with ideas.

'I
 put some of them online and got a bit of flack from friends. They 
thought it was a bit strange and joked I had too much time on my hands.

'But publisher saw my ideas and got in touch. It all took off from there.'

He
 added: 'We had such great feed back from parents saying that it would 
help their child eat different foods and try new things.

'Emails where coming in from across the globe from parents in places like South America, Canada and Australia.

'They were using the book to have fun with the fussy child and get them involved in creating their own food.

'I
 believe if a child takes the time to prepare and craft their own 
sandwich creation from a few simple ingredients, they are much more 
likely to try new foods.

'My two children love making their 
own funky lunch now, they come up with their own ideas and use just the 
ingredients we have in the fridge or cupboards.'

Mr Northeast's latest
 £7.99 book, called Funky Party, recently launched in the UK and is

goods, puddings, sweet treats and hot dinners, to drinks and snacks.

'There is a good helping of fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the recipes to keep within the ethos of encouraging children to eat healthily.

'I had two eager tasters on hand - both Oscar and Izzy gave me the thumbs up or down on how my ideas looked and tasted.

'They thought of ideas too - Oscar came up with the idea of frog with a raisin fly on it’s tongue. It was great that he wanted to include fruit.

'I’ve already given a few copies to mums on the playground and I’ve had a great response.'
