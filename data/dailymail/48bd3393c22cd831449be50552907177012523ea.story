A killer’s conviction has been thrown out and he must be tried again after a court stenographer erased the transcript of his murder trial by mistake.

Randy Chaviano, 26, of Hialeah, Florida, was convicted by a Miami jury in July 2009 of shooting dead Carlos Acosta in September 2005.

But stenographer Terlesa Cowart allegedly only had her transcript on an internal disc, then put it on her computer. Then a virus wiped everything.

‘The overturning of a murder conviction always means terrible pain for the victim’s family,’ a Miami-Dade State Attorney’s spokesman said.

He told the Miami Herald that it also causes ‘frustration for prosecutors and police’ - but this incident brings a ‘brand new level of pain and frustration’.

Mr Acosta had come to Chaviano’s house to buy drugs and they got into a heated argument which saw him shot dead by the defendant.

Chaviano then allegedly planted a gun on Mr Acosta’s body. His defence lawyer said this was only because he panicked after the killing.

But jurors still convicted Chaviano of second-degree murder with a weapon and armed drug dealing. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Chaviano’s lawyers claimed a medical examiner did not properly testify and there was little evidence to show where the shooting happened.

‘Hopefully, I will get to try it again,’ his defence lawyer Israel Encinosa told the Miami Herald. ‘I think I can win it this time. It was an injustice.’

Ms Cowart allegedly did not bring enough rolls of paper for her machines, her ex-employer Goldman Naccarato Patterson Vela & Associates said.

After the trail she transferred the data from the stenography machine’s internal disk onto her computer and then erased it from the machine.

But a virus on her computer meant she lost her notes and lawyers could only find a transcript of a pre-trial hearing and closing arguments.

Florida court stenographers are against moves to replace them with digital recorders to capture hearings, reported the Miami Herald.

Many courtrooms in Miami-Dade have already been wired and will soon start using digital recorders. Meanwhile, Ms Cowart was fired from her job.
