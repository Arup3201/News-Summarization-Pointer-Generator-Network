Richard Otunga, 37, repeatedly plunged a knife into Shamim Gabriel, 33, in a 'horrifying' and savage attack at their flat in Northolt, west London

A jealous Royal Mail worker who stabbed his wife 32 times for texting other men before inviting her father around to show him her dead body was jailed for life today.

Richard Otunga, 37, repeatedly plunged a knife into Shamim Gabriel, 33, in a 'horrifying' and savage attack at their flat in Northolt, west London.

The Old Bailey heard that Otunga had called his father-in-law and said that he had argued with his wife and that she had no serious injuries.

But Ms Gabriel’s father, Gabby, arrived to find his daughter lying in a pool of blood, wearing only her underwear.

He asked Otunga: 'Is this what you called me for, to show me the body of my daughter?'

He told the court that his son-in-law simply replied that he was 'very sorry'.

Otunga later told detectives his wife came at him with a knife and he was trying to defend himself.

He said: 'I killed her. She was getting text messages from men at work, we both work for Royal Mail.

'We argued and she went to the kitchen and picked up a knife and said she would kill herself, so I took it and killed her.'

The postmortem revealed Ms Gabriel had suffered 32 wounds.

Otunga,
 who had a history of domestic violence, claimed he had 'lost 
consciousness' during the incident on December 29, last year.

The
 court heard that Ms Gabriel had repeatedly complained to her family 
about Otunga’s jealous behaviour, and that in July 2013 he held a knife 
to her throat threatening to kill her.

A few months later he threatened to run the man who was texting his wife over with his car and murder Ms Gabriel as well.

Otunga, of Northolt, west London, was found guilty of murder. He had admitted manslaughter.

Sentencing Otunga, Judge Timothy Pontius said: 'This case and the evidence upon which the jury convicted you of murder presents a truly tragic picture of a marriage which was for much of the time happy and loving, but one which was polluted by your possessive and jealous behaviour towards your wife.'

He added: 'On 29 of December last, you took a kitchen knife, or knives, and attacked her with such unrelenting savagery that 32 stab wounds were identified by the pathologist, many of which were fatal.

'So ferocious was the attack that she did not stand a chance of survival. She had fallen pouring blood to the floor. More than half and hour passed before you rang 999, and only then upon the instinct of your father in law by which time of course, any chance of her life being saved - if any chance existed - had long gone.'

Judge Pontius said that he had attacked his wife with 'horrifying savagery', and added: 'It doesn’t take much imagination to picture the terror your wife must have felt as you struck those blows again and again.'

In a statement to the court, Mr Gabriel said he would never be able to forget seeing his daughter lying dead.

He added: 'Shamim was a very generous and caring person and would provide emotional assistance to her sisters.

'When she was alive she was the centre of our family. As far as I am concerned, Shamim’s death had effected me very badly. I will never ever forget seeing her lying on the kitchen floor with just her panties on.

'Shamim’s murder has left my family incomplete. Her murder had brought a sort of numbness to our family and emptiness.'
