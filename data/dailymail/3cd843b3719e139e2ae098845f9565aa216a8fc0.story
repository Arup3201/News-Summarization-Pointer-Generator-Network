Richard Sherman may have been condemned with racist abuse in the wake of his spirited post-game rant on Sunday, but according to his parents he is simply being misunderstood.

Sherman, who grew up in Compton, Los Angeles and was educated at Stanford University set tongues wagging at homes and online after he launched into a tirade on live television against San Francisco receiver Michael Crabtree.

Even though he justified his trash-talking because of the rush of victory in the NFC Championship game, thousands took to Twitter to criticize what they called classless comments - but in an interview on Monday his parents Kevin and Beverley denied their son was at fault.

Proud and supportive: Beverley and Kevin Sherman brushed off any criticism of their son Richard after his brash rant on live television on Sunday night

'People really misunderstand my son,' Sherman’s father Kevin told CBS2/KCAL9′s Bobby Kaple.

'My son off the field is probably one of the best people you want to know. I mean, everything he does is for other people.'

Sherman's parents were unaware of their son's controversial interview in which he called Crabtree a 'sorry receiver' and boasted about how he 'shut his mouth real quick' in a heated interview with Fox's Erin Andrews.

But his mother Beverley said that she is still so proud of her son, 'who never ceases to amaze me.'

Thousands of people took to Twitter to direct racially charged insults at Sherman, with many hate-filled posts suggesting the corner's race was behind his larger-than-life behavior.

Others including New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady criticised Sherman for a lack of professionalism.

And the Stanford educated straight-A student today blasted back, saying: 'Last night shows that racism is still alive and well... And that's so sad.... At Least some people respect MLKs dream'.

'It's a small part of who I am': Richard Sherman said adrenaline and a long-standing grudge made him launch his attack on Michael Crabtree

Crucial moment: Richard Sherman (25) hit the ball away from San Francisco's Michael Crabtree (15) to prevent a game winning touchdown in the dying moments of last night's NFC Championship game

He also penned a column titled ‘To Those Who Would Call Me A Thug’ in which he said that it was 'sad and unbelievable to me that the world is still this way, but it is. I can handle it.'

The
 carefully-worded piece in Sports Illustrated is not typical of a 
football player and has caused many to reconsider their opinion of 
Sherman after his rant, which he blames on 'adrenaline'.

Friends
 have also revealed that Crabtree and Sherman have been enemies since 
Crabtree allegedly tried to start a fight with Sherman at a fundraiser 
in Arizona held by receiver Larry Fitzgerald last year.

After preventing a game winning 
touchdown pass reaching Crabtree in the dying moments of last night’s 
game, Sherman said in a post-match interview: ‘When you try me with a 
sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's the result you're gonna get .... 
Don't you [Crabtree] ever talk about me! Don't you open your mouth about
 the best or I'm gonna shut it for you real quick.'

And he today defended his comments, blaming the adrenaline in his system but saying of Crabtree ‘I just don’t like him’

He
 wrote in Sports Illustrated: ‘It was loud, it was in the moment, and it 
was just a small part of the person I am. I don’t want to be a villain, 
because I’m not a villainous person.’

Sherman, who got straight As at
 high school in Compton, graduated second in his class and attended Stanford, 
penned the column after his actions attracted a wave of criticism. Much of it was racially charged, but others claimed his fired-up outburst was unprofessional.

His head coach Pete Carrol said he had talked to him about the outburst. He told ESPN: 'It's unfortunate that it was so crazed, but that's who he is. His mental make-up to get ready for that matchup was expressed right there so he could play the way he can play. Unfortunately, sharing with the world, it didn't come across so well."

Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady implied criticism of 
Sherman, when he told NESN.com that his team ‘wins with graciousness’ as
 opposed to the Seattle cornerback’s approach.

Sherman also attempted to defend himself on social media

Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander said Sherman would get a ‘high and tight fastball’ for the remarks.

The New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica said Sherman ‘acted and sounded like an idiot’.

Friends have revealed to the Seattle Times that Sherman vowed to humiliate Crabtree after the pair almost fought at a fundraiser held by Arizona receiver Larry Fitzgerald last year.

But others have sprung to Sherman’s defence, pointing out that the comments were made only moments after the game had finished.

There
 is a mandatory ten minute cooling off period for players before they 
talk to the media in the locker room after games, but this does not 
include on-field interviews.

USA Today writer Chris Chase wrote, ' 
Sherman is brash, loud and so self-centered he makes Kanye look like a 
wallflower. He’s also the best corner in the game and on his way to the 
Super Bowl.

'You don’t have to like it, Michael, but you at least need to
 understand it. Next time you beat Richard Sherman, you can talk all you
 want.'

Crabtree responded to Sherman's rant on Twitter by saying, 
'Film don't lie... @nflnetwork @espn pull up the tape of that game and 
show me where this guy is the best? #fake #fake #fake'
