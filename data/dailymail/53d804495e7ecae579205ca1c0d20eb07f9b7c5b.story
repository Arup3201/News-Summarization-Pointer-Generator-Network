There's been acai,  kale, chia, and goji berries. But another obscure superfood new on the market in Australia is being heralded for its multiple health and beauty benefits, which include aiding in weight loss, slowing down cellular ageing, energy boosting, reducing skin conditions such as eczema, and giving a glowing complexion.

While superfoods from the sea are nothing new, brown algae is being called superior due to its high levels of protein and fibre.

Victoria Beckham, Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow are among the stars said to have adopted brown algae into their lives and their bodies. Britney Spears is also a fan and reportedly even eats it raw.

Algae is any plant based organism that grows in water. So, when you’re talking about seaweed, you’re talking about algae. 

Spirulina lacks the same levels of fibre and is harvested from farms, leaving it open to possible contamination.

Brown algae is most familiar to people as kelp and is especially common in the cold clean waters of the Northern Hemisphere where it is sustainably harvested.

But how can this superfood help you lose weight? In one word, iodine.

Iodine is a crucial element in weight loss as it regulates the thyroid gland, a gland in your neck that hormones can either wreck havoc or cause balance in our bodies.

Natural benefits: Brown algae has a high concentration of iodine, one gram is reportedly equivalent to 50 times the recommended daily intake

Most Australians have an acute deficiency in Iodine because we don’t eat enough wild fish, seaweed or algae. This means a lot of Australians suffer hyperthyroidism or under stimulated thyroids leading to unnatural weight gain.

Now, brown algae has an extraordinarily high concentration of iodine, one gram is reportedly equivalent to 50 times the recommended daily intake. 

Because of our natural iodine deficiency, it’s argued that increasing your consumption can increase your metabolic rate and in turn help you burn more calories.

When it’s fresh it is slimy seaweed, and for this reason it is often dried, powered and consumed in capsule or shake form. Some recommend trying it with rice milk.

It reportedly contains unique antioxidants and fibres that have been linked to emerging studies that show anti-cancer, anti-viral and anti-bacterial benefits as well as promoting anti-senescence which is the process of slowing down cellular ageing.

Drink it down: As consuming slimy seaweed can be less than palatable, it is often dried and powdered. Divinita arrived on Australian shelves in November

Brown algae is also high in other nutrients like calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, chromium, copper, selenium and zinc and many B-vitamins

Professor Peer Schneck from Queensland University’s School of Agriculture and Food Sciences said his research shows that brown algae seaweed is more rich in antioxidants than acai berry and contain more vitamins that tomatoes and pumpkins.'

It also keeps you feeling fuller for longer. 

‘It comprises more protein than eggs and has a low GI,' said Professor Schneck. 

'This is particularly important because it allows the body to slowly digest the contents which may help with the feeling of satiety and allow for better absorption.’
