If you've noticed an unusually high number of teenage girls sporting pink hair or dressed up to the nines in Hello Kitty, Japan's kitsch 'Kawaii' trend could be to blame.

Translated as 'cuteness' or 'adorable', the look involves emphasising child-like features such as big eyes and wearing doll-like dresses in sugary pinks, blues and yellows.

So popular is Kawaii in Japan that even men are getting involved, attempting to adopt androgynous doll-like looks, and in the UK, meanwhile, Kawaii is taking the teen world by storm.

At Hyper Japan, an annual celebration of all things Japanese due held at London's Earl's Court at the end of July, you'll find more than a few British Kawaii girls.

That's because the show also hosts a Kawaii fashion show, this year dubbed the 'Tokyo Fashion Story', where models will take to the catwalk in sugary style.

Among those to take part in last year's show is Grace St. John, now a Hyper Japan model, and fan of the 'Sweet Lolita' style of Kawaii dressing, which includes piling on the lace, bows and frills in order to appear as sweet and girly as possible.

'I really enjoyed it,' she says of her appearance at the 2012 Kawaii show. 'It was really nice to be able to smile in a catwalk and wear the clothes that I really felt comfortable in and enjoy wearing.'

But she admits that the outlandish Kawaii look can sometimes lead to problems when she's out and about in London.

'Sometimes being a Kawaii girl can be hard as a lot of people don't understand the fashion, and will shout at you in the street,' she reveals.

'But I do get a lot of people coming up to me and telling me how much they like my style too. I went from loving Kawaii things to being a bit of a kawaii-aholic!'

'I've always loved cute and frilly things
so it was inevitable I would end up in love with Japanese fashion,' adds fellow Kawaii girl, Katie Carter.

'Where I live in Essex, there's not much like it so I'm always getting 
asked where I buy my clothes from and for what reason I'm "dressed up".' 

And Kawaii really is about dressing up. The commonest Kawaii style is called the 'classic Lolita', which despite referencing the Nabokov novel in the name, has nothing to do with looking sexy and everything to do with achieving a look that is as cute, girlish and pretty as possible.

Based on frilled and furbelowed Victorian styles combined with a hint of goth, girls hope to achieve a porcelain-doll look using lashings of lace, ribbons, bows, ruffles, bloomers, aprons, and ruffled petticoats.

Then there's the 'Sweet Lolita' look loved by St. John. Featuring even more ribbons, bows, and lace, than the 'Classic Lolita', it leaves out the gothic elements in favour of pastels.

Fairy Kei is also popular and involves giant bow headdresses or bonnets, teamed with lighter, less extreme make-up.

'My initial inspiration was from Japanese 
Lolita brands and the more classic style of Lolita fashion,' says long time Kawaii girl and Hyper Japan organiser, Pixie Late.

'I find it exciting and fun because being a
Kawaii girl means you can express your personal style creatively and 
make it your own.

'Fashion has always been something I'm passionate about
and when you love what you do you tend to do want to do it well. It is 
also great to share to everyone what Kawaii style is all about.'

For that, Late has set up her own Facebook group, Frills and Frolics, to try and show a wider audience what Kawaii is all about.

'It's a great way to meet like minded people,' she explains. 'I founded Frills & Frolics group so that Japanese street fashion enthusiasts from all walks of life in the UK can meet and learn and share 
their love for fashion.'

'I love Kawaii fashion as it makes me so 
happy,' adds St. John. 'I just wish more people were able to enjoy it in the UK. It gives
me a chance to experiment and it makes getting dressed fun again.'
