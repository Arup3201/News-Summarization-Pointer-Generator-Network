It is the daily routine that dog owners must get used to in order to keep their animals fit and healthy.

But the term 'walkies' has taken on a whole new meaning for Elizabeth Curran, who likes to take her ponies for a trot while she rides on her mobility scooter.

The 59-year-old, from Wythenshawe, Manchester, can often be found taking her miniature horses Tinkerbell and Jezabell for a canter along the roads in her housing estate.

At the same time, she holds the reins of her tiny pets or clips on a dog lead and drives her scooter along by their side.

The mother-of-two, who lives at Peel Hall, competed for many years as a long distance rider, but her career and hobby was cut short by weight issues.

But she has found a new way to spend time with her beloved horses - even if it is on a much smaller scale.

She said: 'It might be unusual for a woman with a mobility scooter to walk a horse, but Tinkerbell is only tiny and I can't ride her.

'I used to
 be able to ride but I can't now. Tinkerbell and Jezabell like to go out
 and meet people so I thought 'well, my scooter can be my legs'.

'Everybody knows me in Wythenshawe. People stop their cars and come running back and say 'can I take a photograph?'.'

There's a good horse: Elizabeth Curran leans over from her mobility scooter and rewards her horse Tinker Bell with a snack as she takes the animal for a walk around Wythenshawe in Manchester

Mrs Curran often takes Tinkerbell, eight, and Jezabell, 12, to care homes and charities and they are also at home on a stage, where they double as donkeys in nativities.

She bought the horses for Â£1,000 each from a stud farm in Cornwall.

Hairdresser Christine Williams, who runs the Reflections salon in Peel Hall, said: 'We see her out all the time, it's a lovely sight. It's particularly good at Christmas when she dresses them as reindeer.'

Grandfather-of-four Alan Millington, 62, said: 'I remember Liz moving in and thinking "oh my God, horses in Wythenshawe, that can't be right".

'But it really works. She's famous now, all the kids come to see the horses and she does lovely stuff for charities.'

Mrs Curran, who is married to Clifford and also has five dogs, added: "My animals give me a reason to get out of bed in the morning.'
