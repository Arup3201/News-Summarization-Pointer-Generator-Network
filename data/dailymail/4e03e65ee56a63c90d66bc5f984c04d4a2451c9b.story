A helicopter crash that killed three people in Russia was caused by the drunk pilot allowing an also-inebriated passenger to pilot the aircraft, according to an inquiry.

The US-made Robinson R44 went down in a forest near the town of Solnechnogorsk, northwest of Moscow, on the afternoon of December 8 after clipping some tree tops and spinning out of control.

An analysis of the pilot's blood after the crash revealed that he had a blood alcohol level of 0.9 per mil, above the UK legal driving limit of 0.8. The passengers had a level of 1.6 and 2.2 per mil.

The pilot was reportedly in the helicopter's front-left seat when the helicopter crashed. He would usually be expected to be in the front-right seat as it is fully equipped for flying the aircraft, reported Zee News.

This suggests it was being flown by the passenger, the Interstate Aviation Committee said in a report released Friday.

The commitee also said the pilot had used forged medical documents to obtaine his license illegally and neither the pilot nor the front-seat passenger was qualified to fly an R44 at night or in bad weather.

The helicopter crash took place just northwest of the Russian capital of Moscow
