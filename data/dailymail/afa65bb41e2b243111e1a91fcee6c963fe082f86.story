Lindsey Vonn, the reining Olympic downhill ski champion, had to be carted off a mountain in Colorado this morning after she crashed during a practice run.

Vonn's accident comes just three months before the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February.

Vonn, 29, had been rehabilitating her surgically-repaired knee after she tore her ACL in a crash at the World Championships in Austria in February. 

It is unknown whether she re-injured her right knee or whether the injury is severe enough to keep her out of the Olympics.

Lindsey Vonn won two medals at the Vancouver Olympic Games in 2010 - including a gold in the downhill skiing event. Her performance on the world stage turned her into an international superstar

Vonn, pictured here earlier this month, has been training hard in an effort to recover from her February injury and be back in shape in time for the Sochi Olympics

U.S. Ski Team spokesman Tom Kelly said Tuesday that Vonn is being evaluated at a hospital after being taken off the slope at Copper Mountain, Colorado, on a sled.

'We have no reason to believe it's anything significant right now,' he said.

The four-time overall World Cup champion tore her ACL and MCL in a crash at the world championships in February.

She has been aiming to return to Word Cup competition next week in Beaver Creek, Colorado.

She won the gold medal in downhill skiing and a bronze in the Super-G at the 2010 Vancouver Games. 

Before that, she won three consecutive World Cup titles - 2008, 2009 and 2010. She won a four in 2012 and became only the second American woman in history with four World Cup championships.

Vonn posted this picture of one of her practice runs on Instagram on Monday. She had been pushing herself to regain her form after her ACL surgery

Her victory in Vancouver turned her into an international superstar in the sport of alpine skiing.

If she is unable to compete in Sochi, the U.S. Ski Team would lose one of its foremost athletes and the U.S. Winter Olympic Team would lose one of its biggest stars.

On Monday she tweeted a photography of herself on the slopes with the message: 'Catching some air today in Downhill training.'

With her knee feeling so good - she was months ahead of schedule - Vonn thought about pushing up her return to competitive ski racing to the season-opening race in Soelden, Austria, late last month. But, she changed her mind and skipped it to train even more.

Vonn recently said her super-G is 'some of the best super-G I've ever skied, but my downhill still needs a little more time.'

She's been training at the team's speed center in Copper Mountain.

The 29-year-old Vonn showed up on the sideline Sunday night for the Chiefs-Broncos game with boyfriend Tiger Woods.
