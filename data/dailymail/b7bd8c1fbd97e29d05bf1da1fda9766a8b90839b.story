Arsenal go into their Champions League clash with Anderlecht facing a goalkeeping crisis with untested Emiliano Martinez set to be thrown in at the deep end.

The Gunners are without first choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny due to suspension following his red card against Galatasaray and second choice David Ospina is out with a thigh injury.

Third choice Martinez trained with the rest of his teammates ahead of the trip to Belgium alongside three other untried keepers.

Argentine Martinez, 22, is a product of Arsenal's youth system, he has played just twice for the club - his last appearance came in the kamikaze 7-5 Capital One Cup win over Reading two years ago.

Martinez spent a period on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last year.

He played 15 times for the Owls but the Champions League tie in Anderlecht will be the biggest match he has been involved in since his arrival in England.

Pat Jennings

The Nothern Irish international played for both Arsenal and Spurs during his career. He helped the Gunners to the FA Cup win in 1979.

Bob Wilson

Wilson was a one-club man joining the club in 1963 and was a key member of the Double winning side in the 1970-71 season.

David Seaman

The England No 1 played over 400 times for the Gunners winning the league three times and the FA Cup four times. He also helped the club win the League Cup and Cup Winners' Cup.

Ryan Huddart, Josh Vickers, Matt Macey all trained with the first team as Arsene Wenger prepares for the Gunners third group game.

Huddart was the Arsenal youth team goalkeeper last season and now features for the Under 21s on a frequent basis. He signed for Arsenal from Charlton and has England honours at schoolboy level and is expected to get the nod to start on the bench.

Vickers has spent the last two campaigns in Arsenal's youth team squad and finished 2013-14 on loan at Ryman Premier League side Canvey Island. He was able to participate in Arsenal's run to the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup last season, where they were knocked out by eventual winners Chelsea.

And Macey went straight into the Under 21 squad following a successful trial about a year ago that persuaded the Gunners to sign him from Bristol Rovers. He started 15 games for the U21 side and travelled with the first team squad for their pre-season training camp in Austria over the summer.

So far in the Champions League Arsenal have beaten Galatasaray but lost to Borussia Dortmund and have three points from a possible six.

There was some good news for Wenger as Aaron Ramsey trained with the squad as he prepares to make his first start in a month.

The Welsh international came off the bench during the draw with Hull at the weekend and is in line to start on Wednesday night.

There was further good news for Arsenal as Theo Walcott trained with the first team as he steps up his return from nine months out after rupturing knee ligaments against Tottenham Hotspur in January.

He played 45 minutes for the reserves on Friday night, but is not expected to feature against Anderlecht.
