These images capture the moment hammer wielding thugs raided a jewellers for half a million pounds worth of gold and diamonds - in a minute.

With up to 10 members of the armed gang thought to be involved the men swiped necklaces and other goods from show stands before making their hasty getaway.

The raid took place in Upton Park, London, just after 11am on Saturday and the owner of the shop, Zahid Khan, 56, said his staff were terrified and were lucky to escape without being harmed.

During the blitz at Pakeeza jewellers, four members of staff, three of which were women, took cover in a back office - locking themselves in until the ordeal was over.

Mr Khan said: 'They were very shaken up, it was a horrible experience.

“If I had been there I may have tried to tackle the gang which is not the thing to do in such a dangerous situation, so it was lucky I was out.

“The staff did well to hide from the gang, lives are much more important that what was taken.”

Mr Khan said he had been told by police the raiders could be eastern European criminals who travelled to Britain specifically to carry out robberies.

'The police have told me that they think the gang is Romanian,' said Mr Khan.

'They found masks and clothing dumped nearby after the robbery. There apparently could have been 10 people involved in all.'

Mr Khan said one man was at the front door waiting for customers — a woman and her mother — to leave. As the front door opened, the robber wedged a foot against it, allowing a second man to batter his way through the inner security glass shield with a sledgehammer.

Shoppers outside bravely attempted to tackle the men as they escaped along a busy street, with one trying unsuccessfully to rip the mask off a robber’s face.

Mr Khan, who has owned the shop for eight years, added: 'To carry out a raid like this in broad daylight is surprising with so many people around on a busy shopping day.'

He added that he believed his shop had been targeted because of the high-value 22 carat gold he stocks.

The shop had to be closed temporarily to repair the damage from the raid.

Officers from Scotland Yard’s flying squad are understood to be investigating possible links with other raids on jewellers across the UK.

A police spokesman said that an investigation into the robbery was ongoing.
