Swansea striker Wilfried Bony returns to Anfield on Monday night, seven years after his first visit to Merseyside.

Taking on Liverpool as the Premier League's top scorer in 2014 - having netted 20 times this calendar year - Bony will be keen to add to his tally against the club who rejected him.

The Ivory Coast international spent two weeks on trial with Rafa Bentiez's Liverpool in 2007 but failed to impress and was not offered a contract.

However, eventually earning a move to Europe with  Sparta Prague, Bony proved his credentials in front of goal with the Czech giants before finally catching the eye of Premier League clubs with 46 goals in 65 league matches for Dutch Eredivisie side Vitesse Arnhem.

Joining Swansea for £12million in 2013, Bony has since become one of the English top flight's most lethal marksmen.

Having scored against Liverpool during the Swans' 4-3 defeat last season, Bony admits it was nice to find the back of the net against the club who decided against signing him as a teenager.

Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Bony said: 'I scored there [against Liverpool at Anfield] last season and it was nice because I had been on trial there when I was younger. I was there for two weeks in 2007 when Rafa Benitez was the manager.

'They wanted to see what sort of a player I was and it was amazing as a young guy to get the chance to use facilities like that and to see a stadium like that.

'I remember sitting up in the stand there watching a game and I enjoyed the chance to go and play there because it was my first experience of English football.

'It is always nice to score at places where you have been and you were not able to make it. It's not that you have a particular point to prove, you always have a point to prove in football, but it is nice.'

Now 26, Bony was in fact the subject of interest from Liverpool during the summer transfer window and how Brendan Rodgers' side could do with the Swans frontman they will come up against on Monday.

Without last season's dynamic striking duo of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge - the former now a Barcelona player and the latter sidelined through injury - Liverpool have managed to find the net just 22 times this season. 

Compare that to the 44 goals the Reds had scored at the same stage of last season and it's not difficult to work out why they are struggling in mid-table.

A summer move for Bony may have seen a much bigger total in Liverpool's 'Goals For' column but instead they will have to do all they can to stop 2014's top scorer.

Liverpool have been interested in Bony in the past and the striker would surely  improve the Reds' goal tally

Having dropped goalkeeper Simon Mignolet - only to reinstate the Belgian following an injury to Brad Jones at Burnley on Boxing Day - Liverpool boss Rodgers will be desperate for his leaky defence to tighten up against the Swansea No 10, fully aware of the test that lies ahead for his backline.

Bony will be relishing the opportunity to add to the 20 goals he has netted in the last 12 months; particularly against a defence struggling to keep goals out.

It's his goals which have earned the striker plaudits but those who watch him week in, week out at the Liberty Stadium will tell you there is much more to Bony's game than just finding the back of the net.

Built like a giant with tree trunks for legs, Bony has  boasted a muscular physique since his early playing days - as seen during his time on the field in Prague - and uses it to his advantage.

At ease with his back to goal, holding the ball up for his Swansea team-mates and providing a huge presence as he leads the line,  Bony - who has created 35 chances this year - would aide any team in the Premier League.

Of course, having developed during eight years in Europe, Bony is a much improved player to the one that first visited Liverpool as a promising 18-year-old striker.

However, now Bony is one of the Premier League's most potent attackers, it would make sense for Liverpool to make another beeline for the one that got away. Especially if the striker impresses during his latest Anfield audition.
