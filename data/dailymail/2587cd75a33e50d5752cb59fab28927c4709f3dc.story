President Barack Obama brought the infamous shooting of Michael Brown, a Ferguson, Missouri teen, into his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, citing it as evidence that the U.S. has 'our own racial and ethnic tensions' that compare to the sectarian genocide and ethnic cleansing plaguing the Middle East.'

His remarks focused mostly on armed clashes in Ukraine and on a vicious jihad in Iraq and Syria where a terror group has beheaded journalists for a global Internet audience, where hundreds of thousands have died, and where millions have fled as refugees.

'I realize that America's critics will be quick to point out that at times we too have failed to live up to our ideals; that America has plenty of problems within our own borders,' he told representatives of 193 countries gathered in New York City. 'This is true.'

MILD: Michael Brown's police-shooting death followed his participation in a convenience-story robbery, but civil rights protesters descended on the town of Ferguson, Missouri to demand the cop's prosecution

'In a summer marked by instability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I know the world also took notice of the small American city of Ferguson, Missouri – where a young man was killed, and a community was divided. So yes, we have our own racial and ethnic tensions.'

Michael Brown, a black teen who had just committed a strong-arm robbery, was shot multiple times and killed on August 9 by a white police officer, following a physical altercation. 

The case brought American racial animus out from its periodic hibernation. Agitators from as far away as California and Maine descended on the St. Louis suburb for marches, looting and more than a week of nightly riots.

Attorney General Eric Holder personally visited Ferguson and hinted that the federal government could pursue a criminal case against the officer under federal civil rights laws, even if a Missouri Grand Jury decides no to indict him.

Reaction to Obama's inclusion of the Ferguson episode in a speech about global terrorism and military invasions was swift but mostly confined to social media.

Online critics complained that a moral equivalence between Ferguson and Erbil is unfair because – among many reasons – it allows dictators and terror ringleaders to dismiss their mass killings as comparable to a police action gone awry.

'It suggests they are morally equal,' former longtime American UN-mission spokesman Richard Grenell tweeted.

The worst of it: Looters descended on a convenience store during the riots that followed the Michael Brown shooting in August; no one was killed

Reaction online was immediate and overwhelmingly opposed to comparing Missouri with Syria or Iraq

A former spokesman for the US mission to the United Nations vented his disgust on Twitter

Washington Post chief White House correspondent Scott Wilson, however, had words of praise.

The Ferguson reference, he tweeted, was 'Obama at his best – a view of American exceptionalism that demands work, politics [and] change to make [the] country better.'

Few on Capitol Hill were willing to engage on the subject on Wednesday. Spokespersons for eight members of Congress, including four Republicans and three Democratic members of the Congressional Black Caucus, declined to comment on the record.

Only one House Republican official, who insisted on anonymity, was willing to speak to MailOnline.

He said the president was 'tone deaf to the Nth power' for suggesting 'the America's race squabbles are in the same universe as the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East.'

'If it weren't so outrageous,' he said, 'it would be outright hilarious.'

The others chose not to weigh in despite the language in which Obama couched his comparison of a lone policeman's controversial decision with the systematic execution of countless Muslims by other Muslims.

'We welcome the scrutiny of the world, he insisted, 'because what you see in America is a country that has steadily worked to address our problems and make our union more perfect.'

America is not the same as it was 100 years ago, 50 years ago, or even a decade ago,' Obama insisted, because the U.S. carves out 'a place for people of every race and religion.'
