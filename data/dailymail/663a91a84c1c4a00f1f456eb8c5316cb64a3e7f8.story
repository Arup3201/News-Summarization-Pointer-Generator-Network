Hannah Hawke, 25, a glamour model from Rawtenstall in Lancashire drove her car drunk and with her baby son in the back

A drunken mother who left two of her young children at home alone while she went for a drive in the early hours has avoided jail.

Aspiring model Hannah Hawke, who had drunk several glasses of wine, took her 12-month-old baby boy along in the car.

She left his six-year-old brother and three-year-old sister asleep in their beds, making sure the front door was unlocked – so they could ‘run out if there was a fire’. 

Police later found the bewildered children at the house, distressed and crying and searching for their mother.

Hawke, 25, a single mother, had started drinking after putting the children to bed at 8pm. 

In the early hours her lover rang and asked if she could pick him up from a night out. She decided to take her baby boy with her on the 3am trip as he had woken up.

At 3.45am police were alerted to reports of a couple arguing in a Tesco Express car park in Accrington, Lancashire, and of a woman drink-driving.

They arrived and found Hawke in the car with her baby boy crying in the back. Officers breathalysed her and she was found to be twice the legal limit. 

When questioned about the whereabouts of her two other children, Hawke lied and said they were with their aunt.

Police went to her sister’s home but when they realised the children weren’t there they went to Hawke’s address.

There they found the children in the ‘extremely untidy’ and ‘unclean’ house, desperately searching for their mother.

‘The front door to the property was closed but unlocked and upon entry they saw a little boy standing at the top of the stairs in his underclothes and could hear a young child crying,’ Stephen Parker, prosecuting, told Burnley Crown Court.

‘The girl was crying and had wet herself and her bed. The bed had no sheets covering the mattress and the mattress was wet. The three-year-old asked why her mummy wasn’t there.’

Hawke admitting to leaving the children unattended at her home in Rawtenstall, for perhaps ‘a little longer’ than half an hour and accepted it was wrong. 

She admitted drink-driving and child neglect but she escaped jail and was given an 18-month community order with a 10pm to 6am curfew.

 She was also banned from driving for 16 months and her children have been taken into care. James Heyworth, defending, said Hawke had a ‘regrettable lapse in judgment’ and is now ‘working hard’ to get her children back.

But Judge Jonathan Gibson said she would have to ‘bear the consequences’ of her behaviour.
