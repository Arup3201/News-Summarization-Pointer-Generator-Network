Scientists have developed a transparent eggshell that allows the growth of an embryo to be monitored in a laboratory.

While the ‘egg’ itself was artificial, the bird embryo inside is very much real - and allows the researchers a unique glimpse into how embryos develop .

The method could be used to perform test drugs and techniques on embryos grown in this way, rather than performing tests on laboratory animals.

Scientists in Beijing have created a see-through eggshell (shown looking at the top). They grew a real avian embryo for 17 days - three days before it hatched. The shell was made of a silicon-based organic polymer. It is the first time such an egg has been grown in a laboratory

The embryo featured in the video didn't hatch to grow into an adult bird, but scientists say their methods could allow embryos to be manipulated to understand how various biological processes work.

The method could be a breakthrough in ‘lab-on-a-chip’ technologies, which can simulate a variety of organs such as the heart, kidneys or skin.

Improvements in genetics are causing designer babies to near '100 per cent efficiency' in trials using mice, a leading scientist warned last month.

Dr Tony Perry, a geneticist at the University of Bath, said that society needed to be prepared for the day parents can choose certain traits in their children.

The warning followed a breakthrough in April in which scientists were able to cure a genetic liver disease in living, adult mice using the Crispr-Cas9 gene editing technique.

Unlike other gene-silencing tools, the Crispr system targets the genome's source material and permanently turns off genes at the DNA level.

Dr Perry told the BBC that it may soon find its way into fertility treatments.

'There are heritable diseases coded by mutations in DNA and some people could say, "I don't want my children to have these mutations,'" he said.

He said it is up to society, and not just scientists, to look at the implications and decide whether the technology is worth the risk. 

The goal is to use stem cells to make miniature replicas of organs and see how they react to drugs and treatments.

A benefit of doing this is that, rather performing tests on laboratory animals, the tests can be carried out on specific organs.

Embryos, though, are particularly hard to replicate.

This is the first time a so-called ‘egg-on-a-chip’ has been created in the laboratory.

The two scientists, from the Department of Biomedical Engineering, part of the School of Medicine, at Tsinghua University in Beijing, published their research in the journal Science China Technological Sciences.

The artificial shell matches the shape and curvature of a real eggshell, and uses a transparent layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) - a silicon-based organic polymer.

It is also soft, to mimic the texture of a real shell.

In experiments, carried out over the course of about two years, the scientists constructed a series of the artificial eggshells.

They then cultivated avian embryos for up to 17.5 days - slightly less time than the 20 days required for it to hatch, according to Science Alert.

In a video the embryo is seen moving around inside the egg, and provides an easier method of observing the evolution of an embryo over time.

The method could allow embryos to be altered to observe changes in how birds grow (stock image of an egg hatching sown). And there are hopes the method could be replicated for human embryos

Previously, scientists had to rely on a method known as ‘windowing’ to get a peek into the processes going on inside an egg. 

This essentially involved removing part of the shell and replacing it with a transparent material.

In their paper the researchers say the new method ‘promises a future strategy for “lab-on-an-egg” technology which may be important in a wide variety of either fundamental or practical areas.’

Practical applications are likely to include the injection of blood or any body fluidic specimens into this "egg-on-a-chip" for early diagnosis.

This is because an egg has the potential to function as an amplification system.

And there are also hopes that the method may be a precursor to similar laboratory experiments for human embryos.
