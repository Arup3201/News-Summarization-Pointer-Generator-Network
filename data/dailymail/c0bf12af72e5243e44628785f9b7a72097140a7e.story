The male giant panda at Edinburgh zoo poses seductively today as he gets ready to mate.

Yang Guang reclines in the sunshine and gets ready to mate with his female partner Tian Tian.

She has only a 36-hour annual fertility window when she can mate.

She was also photographed today as she relaxed by her pool while anxious staff wait for her hormone levels to peak.

Ready to mate: Yang Guang relaxes in as he prepares to mate with Tian Tian in the annual 36-hour window of opportunity

Come and get me! Yang Guang, here in his enclosure today, is kept apart from his female mate because of the risk they will attack each other until she is ready to mate

Experts believe she is now almost ready to accept the advances of the male because her grumpy behaviour and loss of appetite suggest she is in season.

When scientists believe the time is right, the pair will meet up to three times a day for 15 to 30-minute intervals.

The pair were introduced to each other during breeding season last year but they failed to mate.

Throughout the rest of the year the two giant pandas are kept apart because they are naturally territorial and could attack one another.

Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.

Edinburgh Zoo, where the pair have lived since their arrival from China in December 2011, has employed a number of measures to synchronise the breeding cycles of the pandas, including controlled lighting, urine testing for hormone levels and enclosure swapping.

If Tian Tian does fall pregnant, it will be July or the first half of August when Edinburgh Zoo experts will be able to confirm it by using ultrasound scans.

The majority of giant panda cubs are born at the very end of August or beginning of September. Although females may give birth to two young, usually only one survives.

The giant pandasâ€™ naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population in the wild from recovering quickly from illegal hunting, habitat loss, and other human-related causes of mortality.

A spokeswoman for the zoo said: 'Things are looking very positive. Tian Tian's hormones are continuing to rise and we are waiting for her to hit her peak.

'Yang Guang is ready to go. He has been doing lots of scent-marking. It's just a question of waiting now.'
