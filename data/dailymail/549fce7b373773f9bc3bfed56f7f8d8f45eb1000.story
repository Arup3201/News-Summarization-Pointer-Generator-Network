Around 200 volunteers swarmed the streets in search of the Ohio State football player who apologized to his mom for 'being an embarrassment' after suffering a concussion on the morning he disappeared.

Defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge has not been seen since he texted apology from his apartment in Columbus, Ohio, at about 1.30 am on Wednesday.

Today the 22-year-old's former wrestling coach Jeremiah Webber led a crowd of volunteers with flyers and maps of Karageorge's last-know steps.

Webber admitted he fears the worst.

A missing-person report filed with Columbus police Wednesday evening says defensive tackle Kosta Karageorge told his mother he was sorry if he was an embarrassment but concussions had his head messed up

'I'm very scared for him,' he told The Columbus Dispatch. 'I'm worried. I'm trying to remain optimistic. We love him, and we want him home.'

Webber urged anyone that may have seen him to contact police.

'If you think you saw a 6'5", 250lb man, there aren't many out there. Chances are, it's him,' he said. 

His appeal came as a group of former Ohio State players tweeted their offer of a $1,000 cash reward for information that leads to Karageorge, who also goes by his middle name Alex.

Ohio State University's football stadium went silent Saturday as an announcer called out his name and the missing poster appeared on the scoreboard.  

The senior was reported missing after he uncharacteristically skipped two practices.

His mother, Susan Karageorge, told police he has had several concussions and a few spells of being extremely confused.

The team's physician insists the squad would not have let Karageorge play after injury or illness if he weren't ready. 

Karageorge was last seen at his apartment around 2 am Wednesday, his sister, Sophia Karageorge told The Columbus Dispatch.

Uncharacteristic: Roommates say the 250lb defensive tackle left the apartment for a walk at 2am Wednesday

Roommates said he appeared upset and went for a walk, dressed in a black hat, black sweater, black pants, and black boots.

Ohio State coach Urban Meyer described Karageorge as a hard worker and an important player in practice.

'Our thoughts continue to be with the family of Kosta Karageorge, and we pray that he is safe and that he is found soon,' Meyer said in a Friday statement.

Karageorge, a former Buckeyes wrestler, joined the football team as a walk-on this season.

He has played in one game and is among two dozen seniors slated to be recognized at their final home game Saturday against rival Michigan. 

The team's physician said he's confident in the policies in which athletes are returned to play after injury

Karageorge's sister said he left without his wallet or his motorcycle. He has a history of concussions, including one a month ago, and might have become disoriented, she said.

'We're very concerned that he's not himself and that he maybe doesn't know what's going on,' she told the newspaper. 

She said after each concussion, he has followed trainers' instructions and received proper care, but 'his repercussions from (concussions) have been long-term or delayed.'

The team's physician, Dr Jim Borchers, said Friday that he could not comment on the medical care of student athletes.

But, Boarches said, 'We are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness.'

The Dispatch reports that about 100 people gathered Friday afternoon in Columbus to post fliers with the player's photo and description.
