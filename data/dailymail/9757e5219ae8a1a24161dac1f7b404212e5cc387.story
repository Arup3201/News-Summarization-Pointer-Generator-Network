The Cyprus financial crisis could infect banks across Europe including Britain, MPs warned last night, as the full horror of the raid on expats bank accounts was laid bare.

Savers in the island’s largest banks face 80 per cent of their deposits over £85,000 being wiped out, far more than anticipated, under the conditions of the EU bailout of their stricken economy.

Residents of the island, and expats hoping for a quiet life in the sunshine, have spoken of losing their businesses and life savings under the rescue deal they have dubbed ‘daylight robbery’.

MP Douglas Carswell has warned Britons to think carefully about which banks they put their money in

Savers at the Bank of Cyprus will see 37.5 per cent of any deposits over £85,000 converted into shares in the bank

When the £8.5billion bailout was announced it was suggested all those with money in Cypriot banks would be asked to pay the price, leading all of them to close their doors for two weeks.

But under the emergency rescue deal agreed last week, only ‘large depositors’ will now take a hammering to raise £5billion of the funds  – including the island’s 60,000 British residents.

Big depositors at Bank of Cyprus, the island’s largest bank may be forced to accept losses of up to 60 per cent, under the package to save the country from bankruptcy, officials said on Saturday.

Those who have invested more than £85,000 will lose 37.5 per cent in money that will be converted into bank shares. They will keep these, but there are fears their entire value could be wiped out.

And in a second raid, they could lose up to 22.5 per cent more, depending on how much is needed to prop up the bank’s reserves. Experts will determine this in the next 90 days. The size of the raid for such investors had been expected to be only 30 to 40 per cent.

Cypriot officials say large savers at Laiki, the second largest bank, could lose as much as 80 per cent of their savings.

Eurosceptic MP Douglas Carswell said yesterday the catastrophic bailout would send the island’s economy into collapse, and have serious consequences for the banking system across the Eurozone.

He said: ‘The thing that should frighten us all is that the clowns that have done this to Cyprus are still running the European Union, they are still presiding over us.

‘This isn’t a bailout, it’s the collapse of Cyprus’s financial system and this is the price. This is not about Russian oligarchs, it’s about ordinary paying to rescue the European elite from their own stupid euro project.

Laiki Bank customers are also reported to be facing the loss of 80 per cent of their deposits above the £85,000 limit

‘I think for the first time in living memory, people in Britain should make certain that they spread their risks and think carefully as to which bank you put your money in.

‘We’ve been led for generations to think deposits are safe but the modern banking system means there are more people who think they are owed money than there is money in the banks.

‘We should not feel smugness, as our Government like the rest of the Eurozone has been too busy trying to rescue bankers from our investment folly. Is this run by people you can trust?

‘They talked about monetary union creating stability in the Eurozone, in Cyprus it’s killed the economy and created real hardship and poverty. Nobody in their right mind would invest in Cyprus and southern Europe.

‘If people in Cyprus have lost 60-80 per cent of their deposits, who in their right mind have that much in their account in Spain or Greece or Portugal? It’s not just about Cyprus, it sends a powerful signal to the Eurozone.’

Cyprus’ Finance Minister Michalis Sarris said the measures were taken to put the Bank of Cyprus on a solid footing. He said: ‘We suffered a serious blow without doubt ... but we now have a bank which is reformed and ready to assume its role in the Cypriot economy.’

Experts predict a huge social impact, with unemployment on the island, currently at 15 per cent, set to soar, and many people vulnerable to losing their homes or being forced under the breadline.

Banks finally opened last week with a raft of restrictions, including daily withdrawal limits of £200 for individuals and £4200 for businesses, and caps on money that can be taken out of the country.

Tryfonas Neokleous, owner of a clothes shop in central Nicosia said: ‘Europe shouldn’t have allowed this disaster to happen here. Cyprus was paradise and they’ve turned it into hell. I don’t expect anything anymore. People are going to spend their money on food and everything else they’ve been deprived of the last 15 days.’

Pantelis Panayotou, a 70-year-old jeweller said: ‘People are numb.’
