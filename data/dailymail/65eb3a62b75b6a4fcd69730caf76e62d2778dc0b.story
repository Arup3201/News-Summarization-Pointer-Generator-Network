Save the Children has been hit by a furious backlash from its own staff for giving a high-profile award to Tony Blair.

Nearly 200 employees have signed a letter condemning the decision to give the former Prime Minister a ‘global legacy award’ as ‘morally reprehensible’ and ‘a betrayal’ of the charity’s principles.

Mr Blair was presented with the award – for the last Labour government’s aid spending – by the charity’s US arm at a star-studded ceremony in New York last week.

But dozens of staff have signed a petition saying the award ‘endangers our credibility’ and calling for it to be withdrawn. The letter demands a review of the charity’s decision-making process which led to the award being given to Mr Blair.

Extracts of the letter published by The Guardian stated: ‘We consider this award inappropriate and a betrayal to Save the Children’s founding principles and values. 

'Management staff in the region were not communicated with nor consulted about the award and were caught by surprise with this decision.’

The award renewed the focus on links between senior figures in the charity and Mr Blair. 

Save the Children’s UK chief executive is Justin Forsyth, who worked as an adviser for Mr Blair for three years and then for Gordon Brown. Jonathan Powell, who was Mr Blair’s chief of staff, is on the board of directors of Save the Children International.

One of the charity’s senior managers sent an email last week commenting on the backlash, and admitting the charity had received a ‘high volume of complaints and negative reactions’ regarding the award.

Global media manager Krista Armstrong accepted that Mr Blair was a ‘hugely controversial and divisive figure in many parts of the world’. 

She also listed questions received by outraged staff members asking why Save the Children would hand out one of its most prestigious awards ‘to a man accused of being a war criminal’.

Two former aides of Tony Blair have significant roles in Save the Children.

Poverty adviser to Blair: Justin Forsyth

Justin Forsyth, who worked in Downing Street from 2004 to 2010, is chief executive of Save the Children UK.

And 12 months ago, Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s chief of staff throughout his time in power, was appointed to the board of Save the Children International.

Mr Forsyth was recruited by Mr Blair to work in Downing Street as an adviser on poverty and climate change. He worked on the Government’s aid agenda, including the Make Poverty History campaign.

Mr Forsyth worked for Oxfam before entering No 10, and stayed on after Mr Blair left as Gordon Brown’s director of strategic communications and campaigns.

He was appointed as Save the Children UK’s chief executive soon after the General Election in September 2010.

Mr Forsyth attracted controversy two years ago when Save the Children UK warned some parents in the UK could not afford hot meals and shoes for their children. The Tories accused him of turning the charity into a political organisation.

His pay packet was also criticised last year when it emerged he was paid £163,000 a year. It has since fallen to £140,000.

As Mr Blair’s chief of staff, Mr Powell was among his most senior advisers, and played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process.

Mr Blair was presented with the award last Wednesday at an ‘Illumination Gala’ at the Plaza Hotel in New York. 

The ceremony’s guest of honour hobnobbed with Hollywood stars including Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner and Dakota Fanning.

He was praised for his ‘leadership on international development’ and the charity pointed to two major summits on debt relief for poor countries during his premiership.

Accepting the award, Mr Blair said: ‘From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest.

‘But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.’

Mr Blair set Britain on course to meet its target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. But critics of the ballooning aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – say the target is arbitrary, warn huge increases in spending will lead to waste, and point out that money is going to India, a country with its own space programme.

Much of the opposition to Mr Blair centres on his decision to take Britain to war in Iraq. But his consultancy work for the autocratic President of Kazakhstan has led to opposition leaders in the former Soviet state saying he has ‘blood on his hands’.

Mr Blair is said to have earned millions of pounds advising Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the former Soviet republic since 1989, on how to ‘spin’ a massacre of civilians by his regime.

Last night a Save the Children spokesman said: ‘Contrary to some reports, the award was not awarded by Save the Children UK or Justin Forsyth, its UK CEO. It was given to Tony Blair last week by Save the Children US at their gala event in New York.

‘He received the award because of his work on Africa and poverty when Prime Minister. He led the G8 nations at Gleneagles to agree a doubling of aid to Africa, debt cancellation and universal access to Aids treatment.

‘In a global organisation like ours of thousands of people, our staff have strong views on a whole range of issues and people and we respect that diversity of views.’

In a lengthy criticism of The Guardian posted on the website of The Office of Tony Blair last night, a spokesman said: ‘The award was in recognition of Tony Blair’s work in leading G8 nations at Gleneagles in 2005 to pledge to double aid to Africa and provide 100 per cent debt relief to eligible countries, as well as his ongoing work in partnership with African governments through his Foundation, the Africa Governance Initiative (AGI).

‘It is extraordinary that while ignoring the body of work undertaken by Tony Blair, the AGI and the people they work alongside in African governments . . . the article also sought to traduce the reputation of Save the Children, and was neither balanced nor fair.’
