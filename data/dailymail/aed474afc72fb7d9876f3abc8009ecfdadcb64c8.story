Scientists using
the Hubble Space Telescope have confirmed that the
Jupiter-orbiting moon Ganymede has an ocean beneath its icy
surface, raising the prospects for life, Nasa has revealed. 

The finding resolves a mystery about the largest moon in the
solar system after NASA's now-defunct Galileo spacecraft
provided hints that Ganymede has a subsurface ocean during
exploration of Jupiter and its moons from 1995 to 2003.

Scientists told reporters on a conference call that it took
some detective work to confirm the discovery.

In this artist’s concept, the moon Ganymede orbits the giant planet Jupiter. A saline ocean under the moon’s icy crust best explains shifting in the auroral belts measured by Hubble.

Scientists first suspected an ocean in Ganymede in the 1970s, based on models of the large moon. 

NASA's Galileo mission measured Ganymede's magnetic field in 2002, providing the first evidence supporting those suspicions.

The Galileo spacecraft took brief 'snapshot' measurements of the magnetic field in 20-minute intervals, but its observations were too brief to distinctly catch the cyclical rocking of the ocean's secondary magnetic field. 

Like Earth, Ganymede has a liquid iron core that generates a
magnetic field, though Ganymede's field is embedded within
Jupiter's magnetic field. 

That sets up an interesting dynamic
with telltale visuals - twin bands of glowing aurora around
Ganymede's northern and southern polar regions.

As Jupiter rotates, its magnetic field shifts, causing
Ganymede's aurora to rock. 

Scientists measured the motion and
found it fell short. 

Using computer models, they realized that a
salty, electrically conductive ocean beneath the moon's surface
was counteracting Jupiter's magnetic pull.

'Jupiter is like a lighthouse whose magnetic field changes
with the rotation of the lighthouse. It influences the aurora,'
said geophysicist Joachim Saur, with the University of Cologne
in Germany.

'With the ocean, the rocking is significantly
reduced.'

Scientists ran more than 100 computer models to see if
anything else could be having an impact on Ganymede's aurora. 

They also repeated the seven-hour, ultraviolet Hubble
observations and analyzed data for both belts of aurora.

'This gives us confidence in the measurement,' Saur said.

NASA Associate Administrator Jim Green called the finding
'an astounding demonstration.'

'They developed new approach to look inside a planetary body
with a telescope,' Green said.

Ganymede joins a growing list of moons in the outer solar
system with subsurface water. 

On Wednesday, scientists reported
that Saturn's moon Enceladus has hot springs beneath its icy
crust. 

Other water-rich worlds include Jupiter moons Europa and
Callisto.

NASA Hubble Space Telescope images of Ganymede's auroral belts (colored blue in this illustration) are overlaid on a Galileo orbiter image of the moon. The amount of rocking of the moon's magnetic field suggests that the moon has a subsurface saltwater ocean.

Scientists estimate the ocean is 60 miles (100 km) thick, 10
times deeper than Earth's oceans, and is buried under a 95-mile
(150-km) crust of mostly ice.

'It is one step further toward finding that habitable,
water-rich environment in our solar system,' said astronomer
Heidi Hammel with the Washington-based Association of
Universities for Research in Astronomy.
