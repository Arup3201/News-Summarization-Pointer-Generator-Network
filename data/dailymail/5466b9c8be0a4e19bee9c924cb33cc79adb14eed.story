The father of a 6-year-old victim of the Sandy Hook school shooting appeared on Piers Morgan Live today to talk about the looming one-year anniversary of the tragedy – and the pain of celebrating the holidays without his child.

Neil Heslin, whose son, Jesse Lewis, was shot dead in the December 14, 2012, massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, said that he expected Christmas spent without his boy to be just as difficult this year as the year before.

‘I will probably take the Christmas tree down that I never took down from last year,’ Heslin said.

He explained that he and Jesse set up the tree after Thanksgiving and were planning to decorate it on the weekend of the shooting.

With Jesse not there to trim it, the bare tree has been standing in the Heslin household ever since the shooting.

Mr Heslin also addressed the controversial decision to release today the harrowing audio recordings of 911 calls made during the massacre, saying he wished they remained sealed. 

‘It’s just a sad reminder of what happened and clearly the day is etched in my mind, December 14th,’ he said.

The grieving man compared the heart-breaking experience of losing a child to an amputation.

‘I guess the best description I could give is it's like losing a leg and an arm and not being able to support yourself,’ Neil Heslin told the interviewer.

On the event of the anniversary, Mr Morgan also spoke to Marsha Lanza, the aunt of the 20-year-old gunman, Adam Lanza, who revealed that the massacre has 'shaken their family to the core.'

Speaking from her home in Florida, Mrs
 Lanza, who is married to the brother of Adam's father, recalled how 
she first learned of the tragedy in Newtown.

The woman said that when she saw an early news report about the school shooting on TV, she thought to herself, 'Oh no, not another one,' not knowing at the time the identity of the killer.

When she learned that it was her nephew who murdered 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself, Marsha Lanza said she was shocked and immediately called her husband.

In the candid conversation about the tragedy, Adam Lanza's aunt said she is no stranger to loss and knows all too well how the victims' families feel.

‘My heart goes out to each and every family that has lost a child,’ she said. ‘Personally, I have lost two sons. I know what you feel, I know what you’ll feel five years from now and 10 years from now.’

She added: 'You can't dwell on the bad times...you will endure.’
