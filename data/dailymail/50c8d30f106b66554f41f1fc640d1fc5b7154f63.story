Norwich's Jacob Murphy has replaced his brother Josh in the England Under 20 squad. 

Josh has withdrawn from Aidy Bothroyd's selection after suffering a heel injury in the Capital One Cup defeat last month. 

The 19-year-old striker has since made three cameo appearances in the Championship, scoring his first league goal in the 3-1 win at Blackpool, but Canaries boss Neil Adams felt it was important to protect the young player.

But twin Jacob Murphy will replace his injury-stricken brother in the England Under 20 squad 

And Jacob will take his place in the squad as England travel to Holland to face the hosts, Germany and Turkey from October 9 to 13.

Josh came off the bench to score a stunning goal on his Under 20s in their 6-0 demolition of Romania during the last international break but this is Jacob's first call-up. 

Adams said: 'Josh is feeling some soreness and complaining of some pain in that area.'
