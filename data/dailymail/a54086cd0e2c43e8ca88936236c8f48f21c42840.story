Prince Harry's girlfriend stepped out for lunch with the matchmaker who introduced them yesterday, and the two girls seemed to be having a whale of a time in the London sunshine.

Princess Eugenie, Harry's cousin, orchestrated the meeting between her good friend Cressida Bonas, 24, and the Prince.

And the two were seen laughing and chatting over a leisurely lunch at Bumpkin in South Kensington with friends on Thursday.

Princess Eugenie, 23, wore a duck egg blue and black wrap dress.

The jersey cotton frock was cinched with a black leather belt and accessorised with black slipper shoes. The royal wore her hair down and relaxed and her nails were painted cherry red.

Meanwhile, Cressida wore her lock highlighted blonde locks in a loose ponytail.

The dance graduate and ski instructor was dressed down in a loose while T shirt and light blue faded jeans worn with crisp white trainers.

Cressida and Eugenie's lunch companions opted for sunglasses on the sunny afternoon.

The group were spotted laughing, joking and chatting as they relaxed and indulged in a spot of lunch at a chic restaurant in London's Kensington.

It comes after Cressida joined boyfriend Harry at the Boodles Boxing Ball held at the Grosvenor House Hotel on Saturday.

The two arrived separately but were among the last of the guests to leave the the annual charity fundraiser.

Cressida wore a simple black dress with 
thigh and cleavage split as she was sneaked through the rear entrance of
the hotel. Harry, wearing a classic black tuxedo, arrived in a car.

Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were also in attendance with their respective boyfriends Dave Clark and Jack Brooksbank.

Cressida,
a young ski instructor and dance student, left without Harry and in the
company of close friend Princess Eugenie and Royal Protection security 
staff.

Cressida is the daughter of Sixties model Lady Mary Gaye Curzon and Old Harrovian businessman Jeffrey Bonas.

Harry and Cressida made their first public appearance together on the slopes in February, at Swiss ski resort Verbier, where they were also reportedly 'kissing like lovestruck teenagers' in a club.

The
society beauty studied at Stowe School followed by Leeds University, 
where Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy also studied. She has modelled for Burberry in the past and finished her dance studies at the Trinity Laban 
Conservatoire at the beginning of the summer.
