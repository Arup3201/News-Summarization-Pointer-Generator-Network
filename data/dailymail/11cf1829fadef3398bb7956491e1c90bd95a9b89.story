Police investigating the deaths of a devout Catholic mother and her two young children in an affluent suburb of St. Louis have backtracked on an earlier suggestion that the tragedy was the result of a murder-suicide.

Officers arrived at the large house in the community of Glendale, Missouri after 11 a.m on Monday and found the bodies of Catherine Murch, 42, and her children in different parts of the home.

Police originally concluded that Murch shot her 10-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter before taking her own life while her husband, Mitch Murch II, was reading a book in a room downstairs.

Tragic: Cathy Murch and her children, Mitch and Mary Claire, were found shot dead at their home by husband Mitch Murch. Police originally thought it was a murder-suicide but have now backtracked

However, officials have since made a 
U-turn in the investigation, backing away from the initial 
murder-suicide theory and announcing that it is too early to draw any 
conclusions. 

Glendale 
police Lt. Tim Fagan said Mr Murch has been interviewed and is 
cooperating with investigators, and said police 'don't consider him a 
suspect'.

Fagan said Mr Murch's 911 calls and his 
account of the incident appear to line up with the evidence gathered so 
far at the scene.

On Tuesday, police removed at least three rifles from the home marked with evidence tags.

Officials are still waiting for results of crime lab tests to determine 
who fired the murder weapon. Also pending are autopsy results and more interviews 
with those connected with the case, according to CBS St. Louis.

Friends, neighbours and a police source told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Mrs Murch had battled depression for years - but the police chief would not comment on the claims.

Mitch Murch, 43, had also been terminated from his job in the marketing department of Centaur Building Services on July 1, the company's chief financial officer, Paul Simons, told the Post-Dispatch.

'The whole company is in shock over this; Mitch was well-respected here,' Simons said, but would not offer any further details about why Murch left.

He had alerted authorities after finding the bodies Monday morning.

He told officials he heard a gunshot, but thought that it came outside the house, 'so he ran to his front door and saw that his wife was laying in the kitchen, his son was laying in a side room and his daughter was on a bed in the second story of the home,' Glendale police Sgt. Bob Catlett said.

The case squad issued a news release Tuesday saying that it had assigned more than 20 investigators to the case.

Fagan said the size of the probe was necessary to 'get a very clear understanding of what happened'.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Fagan declined to address reports that Mrs Murch had been suffering from depression, or speculate whether the family had been experiencing marital or financial problems that would have explained the shootings.

Investigators did point out that there have been no previous calls to the home for any type of domestic disturbances.

Site of tragedy: The Murches lived in a well-appointed two-story brick house situated on a tree-lined street in the suburb of Glendale

Devastating scene: The body of Cathy Murch was discovered on the floor in the kitchen, while her children's bodies were found in a side room and in a second-floor bedroom

Yellow crime tape cordoned off the family's stately four-bedroom home which is located on what one neighbor described to Fox2Now as the 'primo street in Glendale' – an affluent community about 10 miles from St. Louis.  Court records show the Murches bought the home for $764,900 in 2007.

People
close to the family said the parents were devoted to their children and
the Catholic Church.

According to police, the father called and reported one gunshot at 10:57 a.m. He then called back sometime later and told a dispatcher that his wife was dead and he thought it was a murder-suicide.

When EMS arrived on the scene, they found Mr Murch performing CPR on his son. The boy and his sister, Mary Claire, were taken to area hospitals where they were pronounced dead.

Catherine Murch was pronounced dead at the scene. Police recovered a weapon from inside the home, but said no apparent suicide note was found.

Neighbors who gathered outside the 
family's home surrounded by a manicured lawn and nestled in lush 
shrubbery and flowers were shocked by the scene. 

Hidden problems? The Murches' acquaintances described them as devout Catholics who seemed happy, although one person said the mother appeared distraught just days before the tragedy 

'We
have a very nice neighborhood; no problems at all, but then you hear 
this and it hurts that this close it happened,' Phillip Henderson told 
the station KMOV.

Henderson
and his wife, Pat, said their neighbor talked to Mrs Murch just days 
before the incident and something seemed not right.

'She
did say she recently talked to the mother and asked well how are things
going, she said, "Ugh, well you know",' said Henderson. 'So maybe 
something's going on there she didn't know.'

Records show Catherine Murch graduated from the University of Missouri in 1992 with a degree in political science and received a nursing degree from Saint Louis University in 1994. Online records indicate she was a registered nurse.

Mitch Murch, 43, graduated from the University of Missouri, also in 1992. He owns a maintenance management company and is director of a business called The Maids International in Omaha, Nebraska, a cleaning company franchise, according to online records.

He has also previously worked as vice president to facilities management firms, and for Mitch Murch's Maintenance Management - a facilities company founded by his father and run by his brother.

Mrs Murch trained as a nurse and 
aided with clinical trial research. She was working as a Treatment 
Educator at Special Design Healthcare, according to her LinkedIn page.

The family was involved at Mary Queen
of Peace Church in nearby Webster Groves, where the mother frequently 
volunteered in the parish elementary school where her two children went.

The father also headed an anti-abortion 
initiative called the Respect Life Apostolate at the church, and the 
pastor said the family appeared to be a happy one.

Rev. Bob Reiker added: 'We’re just trying to piece it together and come to grips.'

Following the tragedy, the church staff 
said in a statement: ‘We are shocked and saddened to hear of the tragic 
loss of life involving a family in one of our parish communities.

'Mary Queen of Peace Pastor Fr. Bob 
Reiker and Associate Pastor Fr. Craig Holway are working with grieving 
family members and the MQP parish family to cope with the aftermath of 
this tragedy.'

Religious: The Murches were involved in Mary Queen of Peace Church, where the husband headed a pro-life initiative

Strong connection: Both Murch children attended the Mary Queen of Peace parish school where their mother helped parents of new students

Hundreds turned out for an impromptu hour-long prayer service at Mary Queen of Peace in Webster Groves held for the family on Monday night.

Rev. Reiker thanked the crowd during the service, adding: I thought we'd have maybe a dozen people or so.

'But this is proof how much people in our community care. May the Lord be with Mitch and his family and all those who are grieving.'

Craig Avery and his children attended the service and knew the family; Avery said his children attended camp with Mary Claire last week.

'I'm going to miss her so much,' one of his daughters told the Webster Groves Patch.
