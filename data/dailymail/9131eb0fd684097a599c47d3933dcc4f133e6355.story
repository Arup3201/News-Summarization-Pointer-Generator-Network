Lewis Hamilton had a morning to forget on Wednesday after he spun out of testing, hours after it emerged he had split from his long-term girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger.

The British driver had completed 43 laps on the final day of this season’s opening winter test in Jerez, before he appeared to lose control of his Mercedes.

Hamilton stepped out of the cockpit and cut a forlorn figure as he stared at his stricken car.

The session was temporarily red-flagged as track marshalls recovered the car in which Hamilton will bid to retain his world title.

Hamilton was back out on track later on Wednesday as the Formula One paddock gears up for the new campaign which begins on March 15 in Melbourne.

The world champion is bidding to join Sir Jackie Stewart on three world titles after last year’s triumph. He is the bookies’ favourite and Mercedes have enjoyed an impressive start to pre-season.

Hamilton’s team-mate and, arguably his greatest rival again for this year’s title Nico Rosberg, clocked up more than 300 laps during an impressive two days of testing in Jerez; the equivalent of driving from London to Rome. 

‘Last year our weakness was reliability which cost us points, so we have focused on that because we want a really reliable car this year,’ said Rosberg.

‘It's important to see the problems now, which has been the goal to start off, so anything we find here will be much easier to solve.’

It's been a tough Wednesday morning for Hamilton as he spun out after news of his split emerged

The incident came hours after Hamilton’s private life hit the headlines with news that his relationship with Scherzinger was over.

The pair had been together for seven years but the 36-year-old American singer, who supported Hamilton at last season’s title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi, has left the Briton due to the pressures of a long-distance relationship.

A source close to the star told MailOnline: 'It was a mutual decision. The long distance kept them apart for long periods of time.

'They both spent most of their time alone because they were in different countries all the time. Nicole is heartbroken and devastated.'

Scherzinger - currently starring in the West End revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, Cats, in London - primarily resides in Los Angeles, while Hamilton is based in Monaco.
