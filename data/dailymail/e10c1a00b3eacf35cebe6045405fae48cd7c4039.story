A replica taxi used in TV game show ‘Cash Cab’ struck and killed a pedestrian in Canada after finishing production for the day.

A 61-year-old man from Surrey, British Columbia, died in hospital after being hit by the mock yellow cab on Friday night in Vancouver.

The accident happened as a producer was driving the vehicle back to a storage facility after filming had ended for the day.

‘Cash Cab’ is broadcast in North America on the Discovery Channel,  originated in Britain in 2005 and features a replica yellow taxi.

It sees unassuming people who flag down the cab become instant contestants on a game show, answering trivia questions for cash prizes.

Circumstances leading to the accident are still being determined and no charges have been filed yet, a Vancouver police spokesman said.

There were no witnesses to the incident, which happened in the city's Downtown Eastside area on East Cordova Street, he said.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim and his friends and his family. My heart also goes out to the driver of the vehicle, a member of our technical staff, who is shaken and devastated by this tragic accident, as is our entire team'

Andrew Burnstein, president of Castlewood Productions, which produces the show in Canada, said the entire team was ‘shaken and devastated’.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim and his friends and his family,’ he said. ‘My heart also goes out to the driver of the vehicle.

'(He's) a member of our technical staff (and) is shaken and devastated by this tragic accident, as is our entire team.’

Yellow Cab GM Carolyn Bauer told the Vancouver Sun that her firm allows the production company to use their logo on the vehicle.

But she added: ‘It wasn't one of our drivers, it wasn't one of our taxis.’

The victim is not being identified at the request of the family.

The Canadian version of ‘Cash Cab’, hosted by licensed taxi driver and comedian Adam Growe, has been broadcast by Discovery Channel Canada since 2008.

The U.S. version, now filmed in New York and Chicago, has been broadcast on the Discovery Channel since 2005.
