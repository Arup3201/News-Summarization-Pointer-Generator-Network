The parents of two young sisters who died after the car they were in crashed into a roadside ditch just after Christmas have today paid tribute to their 'little angels'.

Tamzin Portor, aged 10, and seven-year-old Jessica, from Sutton Bridge in south Lincolnshire, died in hospital last Thursday after suffering serious head injuries in the accident on the A47 near Wisbech.

The girls' parents said the deaths, just two days after Christmas Day, have left them devastated.

Their father, Allan Portor, 38, was a 
front-seat passenger and his 43-year-old partner, who was driving the 
black Ford Focus, both suffered minor injuries.

The
girls, who live with their mother Lorraine Mason, 31, in Sutton Bridge,
Lincolnshire, were back-seat passengers with their brother Liam Portor,
12. Liam escaped with minor injuries.

In a statement they said: 'The loss of our little angels can never be replaced. The whole family and friends are devastated. The family would like to thank all the well-wishers who have passed on their condolences.'

The mother and father described the children's personalities - how they loved to sing and dance, eat chocolate and watch Doctor Who on television.

Jessica and Tamzin acted as bridesmaids at their motherâ€™s wedding to her new husband Daniel earlier this year.

Speaking about Tamzin, they said: 'Tamzin was a comical little girl. She was always happy and saw the funny side of things.

'She was a good student and helped out at school. She loved helping people. Tamzin loved to sing with her friends and would write her own lyrics.

'She loved to socialise and was a fun person to be around. Her latest craze was Moshi Monsters and Doctor Who.'

Paying tribute to Jessica, they said: 'Jessica was a lively girl who loved to dance and eat chocolate. She loved to wear make-up and going out.

'Jessica was also very comical and had bags of energy. She would bring alive any room she was in. Both Jessica and Tamzin loved music, singing and their pet dogs.'

Both sisters were declared dead after being taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn.

The siblings were travelling in a Ford Focus being driven by a 43-year-old woman when it left the road, overturned and came to rest on its side on the edge of the ditch.

Ambulance service staff treated Tamzin and Jessica at the scene of the accident, which happened at about 6.40pm near Walsoken.

The girls' brother, aged 12, their father, aged 38, and the driver of the car all sustained minor injuries and were released from hospital after treatment.
