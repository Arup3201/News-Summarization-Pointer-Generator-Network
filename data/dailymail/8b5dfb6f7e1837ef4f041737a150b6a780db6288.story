A substitute teacher has been barred from working at a New Jersey elementary school after students claimed that she taped their mouths closed.

Five children at Winfield Scott Elementary School claimed that the woman had placed decorative tape over their mouths last week.

The students said the alleged incident happened during a 'quiet time' the teacher had set for her class after their lunch break.Â

Scared: Munford Henderson says his daughter Angelique was terrified when a substitute teacher put tape over her mouth

The teacher, who has not been identified, has been removed from a list of approved fill-in staff at the school, but parents of the children involved say it isn't enough.

Munford Henderson told NBC New York that his daughter, Angelique, was left terrified after allegedly having tape put over her mouth.

'I don't understand what she was 
thinking. We're talking about kids. You're sworn to protect 
and teach, not to hurt them and put them in fear,' he said.

'She does not need to be teaching and 
being around kids if she can't control her emotions.'

Mr Henderson's nine-year-old daughter claimed that she and her friends had their mouths taped closed 'because we were jabbering too much'.

'My heart kept on beating fast,' the young girl said, adding that the tape almost covered her nostrils and that she felt 'pressured and scared'.

Police and state officials are investigating the alleged incident, and the school has taken steps to prevent the teacher from working as a substitute there.

School officials said that until the alleged incident, the teacher had a good record.
