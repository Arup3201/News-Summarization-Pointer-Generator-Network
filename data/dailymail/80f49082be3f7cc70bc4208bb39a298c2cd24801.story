Short, sharp bursts of exercise could transform the lives of the over-60s, research suggests.

Just two one-minute sessions a week for six weeks dramatically improved the health and physical fitness of men and women in this age group.

Blood pressure dropped and everyday tasks such as getting out of a chair or  carrying shopping became easier.

Improving health: Blood pressure dropped and everyday tasks such as getting out of a chair or carrying shopping became easier, after the participants had carried out two one-minute sessions a week for six weeks

The researchers from Abertay University in Dundee said short sessions of high intensity exercise could help ease the ‘astronomical’ cost of ill-health in the elderly.

High-intensity training, or HIT, purports to offer at least the same benefits as conventional activity but in the fraction of the time and is the subject of much research. The latest study is the first to focus on whether it may help older people.

Researcher John Babraj put six men and women aged over 60 through their paces in his lab twice a week for six weeks.

Each session began with them pedalling all-out on an exercise bike for six seconds before resting for at least a minute to allow their heart to recover and then giving it their all for another six seconds.

Although they began by doing six 
six-second sprints, by end of the study, they were able to do ten per 
session – adding up to 60 seconds of activity.

After
 just six weeks, blood pressure fell by 9 per cent and day-to-day 
activities were easier, the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 
reports.

Dr Babraj said: 
‘What we found with this study, which involves doing just one minute of 
exercise twice a week, is that it not only improved the participants’ 
physical health and ability to do these things, but also their 
perceptions of their own ability to engage in physical activity.

‘They enjoyed it, were delighted with the effects it had on their health and, on top of that, felt they could fit it into their lives, which is something they aren’t able to do with current exercise recommendations.

‘If people aren’t meeting the targets, we need to find ways to work with them when it comes to exercise, rather than just persisting with something that isn’t working.

‘High-intensity training is an achievable alternative that could make a real difference to people’s health and quality of life.’

Current guidelines say pensioners need to do at least two and a half hours of cycling or fast walking a week, plus two sessions of yoga, gardening or other activities that strengthen muscles.

Dr Babraj said that those who do not have an exercise bike can get the same benefit from six-second runs up a steep hill and added: ‘When it comes to the sprints, you don’t have to go at the speed of someone like Usain Bolt.

Tried it out: Andrew Marr has blamed the stroke he suffered on experimenting with high intensity exercise

‘As long as you are putting in your  maximal effort, whatever speed that happens to be, it will improve your health.’

He said it could be argued that short, sharp sessions put less strain on the heart than lengthier, less intensive ones.

BBC presenter Andrew Marr has blamed the stroke he suffered last year on experimenting with high intensity exercise. Dr Babraj cautioned that people should check with their doctor before embarking on a training programme.

Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ‘There is a really strong body of research demonstrating the importance of exercise in later life. However it’s important to find the right exercise for you and consult your GP before trying any radical new approaches.’
