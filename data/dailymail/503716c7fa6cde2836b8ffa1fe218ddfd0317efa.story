Premier League clubs are using facets of computer game Football Manager to scout potential signings from all over the world this summer.

More than 20 clubs in English football’s top three divisions and on the continent have signed up to a new initiative designed to hone the recruitment process, which leans heavily on the database of the world’s most popular management simulation.

The new software, called Recruiter, hasn’t yet been fully released, but is already making an impact during this transfer window.

Having a look: The way in which Liverpool and Co sign players (like Lazar Markovic, pictured) is changing 

New way of thinking: Managers are using facets of the computer game Football Manager to recruit 

Great tool: The new software, called Recruiter, is already being used by professional clubs 

Created by world-renowned Prozone in conjunction with Football Manager’s developers Sports Interactive, Recruiter has an astonishing 250,000 players on its database.

Details that scouts and managers can pore over include contract intricacies, ability and physical attributes. Those searches derive from the hours put in by Football Manager’s army of volunteers coupled with people from within the game, who meticulously go through their club from top to bottom in order to make the game as lifelike as possible.

This evolution has improved the first stage of trying to sign a player and could go a long way to weeding out the wasted days that scouts travel across the world in an initial phase of scouting.

With the level of initial detail available on Recruiter, it’s slightly less likely an over-worked scout will be found crashed out at a service station down the M1 after watching Yeovil lose at Sheffield United on a Tuesday night.

‘For years we’ve heard stories of real-life managers and scouts using our data to help with the recruitment process,’ Sports Interactive studio director Miles Jacobson said.

‘From now on, it’s official, real managers around the world will be finding and comparing players using data and a search system that will be very familiar to players of Football Manager.

‘The information gathered by our network of more than 1,300 scouts around the world, combined with Prozone’s amazing performance data, makes this an invaluable tool for any football club that takes player recruitment seriously.’
