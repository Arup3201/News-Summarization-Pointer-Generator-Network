Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself in 2012 after she was sexually assaulted at a party

One of three teenagers who admitted that they sexually assaulted a 15-year-old Northern California girl who later committed suicide has settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by her parents - because he said sorry.

In 2012, Audrie Pott fell asleep after drinking Gatorade laced with alcohol at a friend's party in their hometown of Saratoga. She awoke to find her pants off and lewd comments scribbled over her body.

Her family says she hanged herself days later after learning cellphone photos were taken of her during the assault and shared through text messages.

Three of Audrie's teenage classmates were prosecuted in private juvenile proceedings and sentenced to between 30 and 45 days in juvenile hall. 

Two continue to attend Saratoga High, while the third transferred to high school about an hour south in Gilroy.

Audrie's parents, Lawrence and Sheila Pott, filed a civil lawsuit against the boys to hold them more accountable for their actions. 

Their attorney, Bob Allard, said the parents decided to settle with one of the teens because he showed remorse and 'told the truth' about what happened to Audrie.

'He's accepted responsibility. He's told us the truth of what happened in that room. The others have not,' Allard said. 'They're still standing by their claim that Audrie was awake and consented to their acts.'

Allard said that had the two other teens apologized, they might not have been sued.

'If they had simply knocked on the door of the Pott household, apologized, accepted responsibility and jumped headfirst into our quest to educate our youth by, for example, speaking at high schools about the mistakes they made and how this can be prevented, there would be no civil lawsuit,' Allard said.

Audrie's parents led the campaign to pass a California law which allows prosecutors to seek harsher sentences for juvenile sex offenders who take pictures of their crimes and use them to bully the victims.

The trio of teenagers whom Daily Mail Online is not identifying because they are minors, pleaded guilty in January 2014 and were sentenced to 30 to 45 days each in a juvenile detention facility.

Pott, from Saratoga, California, hung herself September 10, 2012 - just eight days after the teens digitally penetrated her at an alcohol-fueled Labor Day party and took pictures of her in a compromised state.

The 15-year-old girl felt humiliated after she discovered that the cellphone photos showing her naked body covered in lewd comments written in marker had been shared with students at her school.

In February, Pott's parents tried to get all three expelled from their schools - which they returned to after their sentences.

They launched a petition on the site Change.org calling on the principals of Saratoga High School and Christopher High School to expel the three perpetrators responsible for Audrie’s 'slut-shaming.’

At a party in early September 2012, Audrie Pott drank alcohol-laced Gatorade and woke up without her shorts on, with her face painted black and with mocking comments written in indelible marker all over her body.

Over the course of the next week, Audrie learned that cellphone photos had been taken of her during the assault, which involved digital penetration, and shared with students at the school she attended with the three attackers.

'My life is over...I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' Audrie said to a classmate in the days following the incident.

She then pleaded with the boys to delete the photos.

'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.'

Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.'

Eight days after the attack, on September 12, 2012, Audrie hanged herself in a bathroom at her mother's house.

In police interviews, the teenagers admitted to coloring half of her face black with marker, then pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals.

They photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images.

Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school.

She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images.

'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.'

'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body.

She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her.

'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.'

She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.'
