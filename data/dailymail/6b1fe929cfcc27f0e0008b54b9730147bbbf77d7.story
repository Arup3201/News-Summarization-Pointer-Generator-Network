The victim of a home invasion in St Paul, Minnesota identified the three robbers who held him at gun-point last month by spotting them in rap videos on YouTube.

On September 25, neighbors spotted the three men walking around the 600 block of Winthrop Street near Margaret Avenue in East St Paul, seemingly handing out pamphlets.

But when the 31-year-old victim opened his door, one of the men, since identified as 33-year-old Teng Vang, thrust a gun in his face and another hit him.

Found: Accomplice Chozon Yang Chang managed to allude authorities longer than Vang and Thao. He was finally arrested yesterday

The three men then pushed their way into the house and zip-tied the victim's hands behind his back, demanding $200,000 in cash, drugs and to know where a man named 'Meng' was.

But the victim didn't know any 'Meng' and even proved it by showing them his cell phone phone book.

One of the suspects threatened the victim that 'they've done this before and know what they're doing'.

The men put on blue gloves and two of them started to search the home while Vang kept watch of the victim.

While the men were searching the house, Vang took the victim into his daughters bedroom where the 2-year-old was sleeping and pointed a gun at her, threatening to shoot if the victim didn't tell them where the money was.

In the end, the victim handed over $2,000 he intended for rent and a deposit. They also made off with a laptop, an iPad, two handguns and a couple of Michelob Golden Light beers.

Before leaving, the men took the victim down to the basement there they placed a black plastic shopping bag over his head, moved his hands in front of him and tied them with phone cords.

The man was eventually able to bite through the cords, grab his daughter and call police.

But just three days later, it was the victim and not police who brought the suspects to justice.

The victim was watching rap videos on YouTube when he came across a video that had all three of his attackers in it.

He called up police and told them that he was '100 per cent sure' he had 'definitely identified' all three of the men in such videos as 'All I do is Hustle' and 'Hooked on Money' - videos that have since been taken down. 

Police identified the men as Theng Thao, 33, Teng Vang, 33, and Chozon Yang Chang, 27. Both Thao and Vang have been arrested, but Chang has not yet been apprehended.

Thao and Vang were arrested on October 3 and Chang was booked in Ramsey County Jail yesterday.

Police say the suspects are members of the Mount Airy Boys and Oriental Ruthless Boys gangs.

All three have been charged with kidnapping, first-degree aggravated robbery and first-degree burglary.
