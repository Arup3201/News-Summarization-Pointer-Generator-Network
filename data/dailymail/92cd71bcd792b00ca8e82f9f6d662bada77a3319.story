Most women are still in recovery mode three months after the birth of a child. But mother-of-four Natalia Vodianova - who welcomed baby Maxim on May 2nd - is not most women.

The Russian supermodel, 32, stripped down to nothing but a fur stole for the September cover of Vanity Fair.

And in a candid accompanying interview, she speaks about her divorce from British aristocrat Justin Portman and her new life in Paris with LVMH heir Antoine Arnault.

She said of her 2010 marriage breakdown: 'If you try really hard at something and it doesn’t work, then you have to let go because it means it is not the right thing. You
 have to try really hard to make it work, but at the same time you have 
to know how to let go of something when it is time.'

Ms Vodianova and Viscount Portman, 45, had three children in their nine years together: Son Lucas, now nine, daughter Neva, eight and Viktor, six, who now live with their mother in Paris and spend half their holidays with their father.

The model confirmed she was dating Mr Arnault, the son of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault, in August 2011 and announced they were expecting a child together in November last year.

And it seems parenthood has only strengthened their relationship.

Ms Vodianova said of Mr Arnault: 'He 
gets up at 8am and goes to work with a big smile on his face. He 
loves what he does, loves my children so much, is a great father and 
stepfather and boyfriend.'

On a potential wedding in the future, she added: 'I guess he is still a boyfriend. I want to 
call him my husband because it feels right, whether we have the papers 
or not. He feels like a husband already, although it doesn’t make a 
difference, does it? I feel blessed. He is everything I love and 
respect.'

The accompanying photo spread in Vanity Fair sees Ms Vodianova pose in decadent eveningwear for celebrated photographer Mario Testino.

And while the rest of us may not be blessed with her supermodel looks, she makes posing for the camera sound easy.

'It’s really a matter of very little details,' she explains. 'Little angles, little tilts of the head. Eyebrows up to make the eyes look bigger. Mouth a little open. Shoulders down for a long neck. It’s a lot like sculpting.'

The September issue of Vanity Fair will be available in New York and Los Angeles, as well as on the iPhone, iPad, Kindle, and other devices, on August 7. The magazine will be on national newsstands and available in an audio edition August 15.
