A married 42-year-old Florida woman has been arrested after police say she had sex with two teenage boys, one of them as young as 13 years old, as other children watched.

The Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said that Jeanine Shimandale, of Bradenton, is now facing four counts of lewd and lascivious exhibition and two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor stemming from an incident that took place last month.

According to detectives, Shimandale had sex with two boys ages 17 and 13 on March 11 while house-sitting in Sarasota during Spring Break.

Another teenage boy and two girls who were also in the house listened to and at times watched the sex acts take place, according to sheriff's officials.

The 42-year-old woman also allegedly bought two bottles of cake- and cookie dough-flavored vodka for the teens, according to an arrest affidavit cited by the Sun-Sentinel.

MyFox Tampa Bay also reported that Mrs Shimandale allegedly threatened to hire a hit man to kill anyone who spoke of what happened between her and the teens. 

She is being held on bonds totaling $100,500, the Bradenton Herald reported. Her arraignment has been scheduled for May 11.       

According to her Facebook page, Shimandale, a Bronx, New York, native, is married and works as a manicurist.

Betrayed spouse: Shimandale's husband of more than three years, Tom, said he was shocked by the allegations against his wife

Her husband of more than three years, Tom Shimandale, told MyFox Tampa Bay that he was completely blindsided by his wife's arrest.

‘I'm confused I have no idea what's going on. I'm shocked and I'm saddened,’ he said. ‘You think you know somebody.’

Mr Shimandle recounted that when he met his wife in jail following her arrest, the 42-year-old did not bother to apologize to him for the betrayal, but begged him to bail her out in exchange for a divorce.
