She may be a successful actress and fashion designer with a wardrobe coveted around the world but Sarah Jessica Parker has admitted fame comes with a price.

The Sex and the City star told The Edit that she does not court publicity about her life as a wife and mother but she still has to deal with people attacking her over these roles.

Most recently, she was horrified when someone wrote a Tweet questioning the parentage of her twin daughters, Marion and Tabitha (who were carried by a surrogate). She was so outraged, she personally replied with a number of her own Tweets.

SJP is now a fashion designer herself but here wears a coat by Mary Katrantzou, left. The actress said she has sympathy for designers now she knows the pressure they are under

She explained: 'I see mean stuff every day: when I look
 at Twitter I scroll with one eye open and one closed. That particular 
day, it was just one of the things I saw.

'I kept scrolling and then I 
was like, "Wait a minute, did she just say that?" I went back and I 
thought, "Well, this isn't unhealthy paranoia, this is absolutely 
conscious. This was a choice. She, not subtly at all, said that my 
children are not my children."'

The 49-year-old, who is married to actor Matthew Broderick, says she doesn't understand why she is often the target of Twitter trolls.

Private: SJP, pictured in a top by Erdem, bra by Dolce & Gabbana and skirt by Simone Rocha, said she is often too embarrassed to talk of her accomplishments

'What is it about me? I am not somebody 
who shows off her good fortune; I don't travel with bodyguards, I don't 
live a very glamorous life - I am afraid of all that,' she told net-a-porter's magazine, as she poses for their photoshoot in springtime florals from some of London's best-known designers including Erdem and Jonathan Saunders.

She added: 'I don't talk about my marriage; I am circumspect about my children. I 
sometimes regret that people don't understand all that I do and all that
 I am because I am embarrassed to talk about what I've accomplished - I 
think it sounds self-centric and narcissistic.'

Referring to the woman who Tweeted about her children, she said: 'I can't figure out 
what she hated so much about me that she did that. And I just can't 
imagine anything lower than that.'

Loss: The star said she was saddened to learn of the death of her friend L'Wren Scott

But she said she can't let such incidents get to her: 'Other people can be mean, 
and that’s something I just have to make peace with.'

Through her best-known role as fashion-lover Carrie Bradshaw, Parker's own style has been emulated around the world and she's recently launched her own line of shoes and bags.

She said the process was far from easy and has given her a new-found respect for her peers in the fashion industry. In particular, she referred to L'Wren Scott, who was a personal friend to the star. 

She said: 'My heart goes out to designers. The expectations, the demands they put on themselves. They put everything on the line. It takes fortitude to survive it.

'I feel so sad about L'Wren,' she continues of the designer who committed suicide this year. 'I have friends who struggle for no good reason; incredibly talented people who have to fight for attention.'
