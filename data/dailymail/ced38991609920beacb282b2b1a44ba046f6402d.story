Holland is harbouring 22 'completely pointless' nuclear bombs belonging to the United States in secret underground bunkers, a senior Dutch politician has revealed.

Former prime minister Ruud Lubbers broke a mysterious political omerta by confirming the existence of American-owned weapons in Europe, which has been branded the 'worst-kept secret' on the continent.

The B-61 thermonuclear devices, whose secret storage has until now been held under a don't-ask-don't-tell pact among European statesmen, are part of a Cold War military arsenal described by Lubbers as 'absolutely pointless'.

Lubbers, whose Christian Democrat party ran the country between 1982 and 1994, told a dutch National Graphic documentary: 'I would never have thought those silly things would still be there in 2013.

'I think they are an absolutely pointless part of a tradition in military thinking.'

A spokesman for the Royal Dutch Air Force refused to confirm their existence at Volkel air base, adding that these issues 'are 
never spoken of'.

'He, as former prime minister, knows that well,' 
he said. 

Dutch officials told local media that the weapons are B-61 
thermonuclear bombs, capable of wreaking four times as much havoc as the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki towards the end of the Second World War.

speeds.

The 'poorly kept secret' of the existence of nuclear weapons in 
concrete vaults emerged in 2010 in the classified US documents published
by Wikileaks.

It was mentioned in a report on a conversation involving US 
Ambassador to Berlin Philip Murphy, US diplomat Phil Gordon and German 
Chancellor Angela Merkel's national security adviser, Christoph Heusgen.
