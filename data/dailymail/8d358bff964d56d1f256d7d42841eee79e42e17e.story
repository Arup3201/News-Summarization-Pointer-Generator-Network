Louise Mensch is sure to attract a new wave of anger from feminists with her new brutally self-depreciating blog.

While the former Corby MP constantly stresses her affiliation to the feminist cause, her website called Unfashionista is driven by the want to 'please your man'.

Mensch's first post is titled The Holy Grail of Heels, where she praises a pair of shoes that have a high heel and are also comfortable.

She continues to describe how, even though heels are uncomfortable, you should 'stuff your ballet flats' because men prefer you in heels.

She says they are 'the sine qua non of looking hot in a dress' and says 'your man wants to see you swing it'.

In the next, What Men Want: Face, Mensch says she got a tweet 'from an irate follower' that said 'Politics to man-pleasing fashion blogging; feminist you are not'.

'Man-pleasing. Wow. What a dreadful thing, eh?' writes Mensch.

'Well, stuff it. As a straight woman I do want to look attractive for my man. He committed to me, and if he likes something I will try to wear it.

'Everybody's tastes differ, but men do like to see a confident, groomed woman who's relaxed in her own skin.'

She then goes on to describe how one 
should apply what sort of make-up to 'be smooth' but 'not look "done".' 
Because that's what men want.

Mensch has dedicated a post to unflattering photos of herself and has captioned each one detailing faults

Mensch has even dedicated a post, calledÂ Oh Dear to unflattering photos of herself, and has captioned each one detailing the faults in her looks.

She told the Guardian since quitting politics and moving to New York six months ago, she's been 'getting more interested in fashion'.

'I felt I no longer had to wear the straitjacket of the uniform of the professional woman who goes into an office every day.

'I do think it's wrong to focus on women politicians based on style. That doesn't mean, however, that as a woman you have no interest in style whatsoever. And it's something that I've gradually fallen into as I've had a bit more time here.'

She tells them how, since moving to New York, she now gets dressed up each night for her husband.

'Even if I'm in my sweats I go upstairs, I wash my face, I put makeup on. The difference is now I've got someone to get dressed up for.'

In a post titled What Men Want: Figure, Mensch details how 'men like curves' and how to 'dress for men'.

Collective sigh of relief? Mensch says men were fed up with stick-thin, sexless models, until Kim Kardashian

She writes there was 'a collective sigh of relief' from men 'fed up to the back teeth with a constant diet of stick-thin, sexless models' when Kim Kardashian's 'celebrity' rose, 'mostly due to her incredible, glorious booty'.

'In general unfashionista thinks women should wear fitted clothes. All women - all shapes. Going baggy to cover it up never works. Adding bulk you don't have also never works.

'Men say they want a girl in a mini-skirt and heels but actually date and marry very differently. They want a woman who is confident, stylish and shows off what she has (whatever it might be) in an elegant manner.'

In another post, Fit Is A Feminist Issue, Mensch argues: 'Nobody should ever be ashamed of their body... But accepting your body and being proud of who you are does NOT mean you don't also try to change it.'

Whether you agree with her or not, she's not afraid to say it how she sees it.
