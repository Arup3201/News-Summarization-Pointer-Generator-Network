Simona Halep secured the biggest title of her career as she battled back from the brink to beat Jelena Jankovic to the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells.

The Romanian looked down and out on more than one occasion as she struggled with a foot problem and Jankovic gave her an almighty let-off when she passed up the chance to serve for a second Indian Wells title.

But in the end the battling qualities of Halep, coupled with the instability of Jankovic who virtually went to pieces as the match went on, got the third seed over the line 2-6, 7-5, 6-4.

'I want to congratulate Jelena you were amazing,' a gracious Halep said afterwards. 'At my age you won this tournament so well done for a great week, a great job and an amazing final.

'I am really happy I could win today. This tournament has been amazing, I thank all the Romanian people who come to support me everywhere. You make me want to fight until the end.

'I am really excited to win this, my biggest title, I will never forget it.'

It had not looked like being a celebration for Halep early on as Serbian Jankovic dominated. She secured the first advantage, taking the last of five break points to come her way in the opening game when Halep slapped a forehand long, but she was immediately broken back.

Serve held for two games after that, but Jankovic moved out in front again, turning a 30-0 deficit into a second break for 3-2. That would be the last of Halep in the set, as Jankovic served out two games and took another against the serve courtesy of a wild Halep forehand to take the set 6-2.

Halep called for the trainer and appeared to have work done to her left foot during the rest, but looked fine as she returned to the court and took the first game of the second, ending a five-game streak against her.

There was no question that she was in trouble, though, her discomfort obvious and the game her first since Wednesday owing to the fact her semi-final with Serena Williams was cancelled when the American pulled out injured.

But despite being broken early in the set, she hit back by taking Jankovic's serve to love. She had little to do as Jankovic imploded, sending a two-hander long and then hitting a short backhand into the net.

It appeared to be a momentary blip for Jankovic who broke straight back but three double faults when serving to go within a game of the title cost her and Halep nailed a backhand winner to level at 4-4.

But the see-saw nature of the match ensured she took the next, again securing a break as she took the second of two points, planting an overhead winner to break down Halep.

She had to call coach Chip Brooks to the chair in the break to calm her down, the pair having an emotional exchange, and tensions were higher at the end of the next game as she was broken again - a fifth game in a row - when she slapped a backhand into the net.

Halep was buzzing now and took the next game, a rare hold of serve, and then broke Jankovic - now the player looking pained - to take it to a decider.

Jankovic got the first break of it, a huge slice of fortune falling her way as a backhand clipped the net and dropped over, leaping Halep stranded and a break down.

It was soon 2-2, though, Jankovic raging as the chair umpire mistakenly called game on her serve only to rewind and call second serve, on which Halep took a break.

There was no surprise at all that Jankovic responded by winning on Halep's serve, and even fewer raised eyebrows as another break followed, before Halep held it together on her own delivery to go 4-3 ahead.

She then broke for what felt the countless time to go 5-3 up and on the brink of victory but in keeping with the match she coughed up her serve with a wild backhand before taking the title, fittingly, with a break as she came in short on a forehand and made no mistake.
