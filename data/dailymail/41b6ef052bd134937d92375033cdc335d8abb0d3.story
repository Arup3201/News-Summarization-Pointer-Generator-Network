Alter ego: Tom Adams, 14, as his drag queen alter ego Tamara

A proud mother has told how her schoolboy son has become a drag queen at the tender age of 14.

Tom Adams loves dressing in drag and has performed with his dance class dressed in a sparkly dress, blonde wig and full make-up.

Tom, from Hartlepool, County Durham, suffers name calling from school bullies because of his hobby, but he is determined to follow his dreams of becoming a performer.

He began using his mother Sharon's red lipsticks, nail varnish and high heels at the age of two and has continued to do so ever since – as his alter ego 'Tamara'.

Tom started dance classes at the age of 10 and began his drag act for regular shows and competitions last year on the recommendation of his teacher.

He said: ‘I love to entertain and this feels natural. I don't want to be a woman but I like the feeling of being in drag, it's glamorous.

‘Girls have so many fun accessories and I love trying them on. It doesn't matter what the bullies say, I'm my own person and this is what I enjoy.

‘I was worried what people might think at first, but as soon as I had my false eyelashes on I loved it.

‘Getting ready felt so exciting. I love everything from the false nails to the lipstick - I feel comfortable dressing up in woman's clothes and I like transforming myself.’

Tom idolises Lady Gaga and Katy Perry and has posters of them plastered across his bedroom walls.

He first took to the stage in front of proud Sharon and his father Jason, 42, in August last year, wearing full drag, including a padded bra.

Mother-of-two Sharon, 41, a shop assistant, said: ‘I didn't give him the idea, it was all his.

‘He never wanted to play football or rugby. Tom loved to dance ballet, jazz and tap. He's really outgoing so we encouraged him. It was completely his decision.

‘I felt so proud, he was wearing a short blue dress, false boobs, a short blonde wig and high heels.

‘He had false nails, eyelashes and green eye shadow - the works. It didn't freak me out a bit, it was an amazing performance.

‘Everyone was really supportive and said how brave he was to do it. I'm so chuffed he's strong enough to be his own person.’

Tom's dance teacher helps him apply make-up but he uses YouTube videos to perfect looks himself.

Even Tom's father Jason, who is currently unemployed, is proud of his son and promptly told his friends about his dressing up.

The schoolboy has performed in drag four times and regularly practices his act in his bedroom at home and is preparing for his latest show next month.

Tom added: ‘Of course the bullies get to me sometimes. They call me a 'girl' and 'gay'. I love how outrageous Lady Gaga is and how Katy Perry looks.

‘That's how I'd like to look in drag. Some of the judges in our dance competitions even think I am a girl. I don't mind, it's nice to think I look so glam.’

Sharon, who also has a daughter Sarah, 21, added: 'I take him to Boots and Superdrug for his make-up but his clothes are specially made by the dance group.

'It's fun shopping together. I've spent about £200 on his outfits.

'He's got an interest in woman's clothes. He helps me choose my outfits - he's the first to tell me if something doesn't look right.

'Tom's talented and he's his own person. If this is what he enjoys I support him. He looks great and he's brilliant on stage. He looks just like his sister.'
