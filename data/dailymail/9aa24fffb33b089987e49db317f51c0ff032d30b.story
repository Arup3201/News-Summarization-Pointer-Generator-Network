Disturbing: Athena Renee Doyle, 35, has been charged with trying to kill her two young sons by intentionally driving off a 300-foot cliff last month 

A Northern California mother is accused of trying to kill her two young sons by intentionally driving off a 300-foot cliff, injuring both children, after ranting online about a conspiracy against her family. 

Mendocino County sheriff's officials say 35-year-old Athena Renee Doyle was arrested on a warrant in Humboldt County last Friday in connection with the October 3 crash that injured her and her two boys, ages 2 and 4. 

Ms Doyle is now facing two felony counts of attempted murder.

Sheriff's Capt. Greg Van Patten told the Press Democrat of Santa Rosa that an investigation determined Doyle intentionally drove her 1992 Isuzu Rodeo SUV down a 300-foot cliff, where it came to rest on its roof on Chadbourn Gulch/Blues Beach off of Highway 1 north of Fort Bragg.

No one was around to witness the crash, and it was not until several hours later, just after 12pm, that California Highway Patrol got a call from a passing motorist about an SUV resting on its roof at the bottom of the hill.

Doyle and the boys, 2-year-old Nicodemus Doyle and 4-year-old Isaiah Hacket-Doyle, were airlifted to area hospitals to be treated for injuries. 

A witness told Lost Coast Outpost that one of the children suffered a broken arm, a broken femur and a head injury.

Both boys have since been discharged from the hospital. 

There is reason to believe that the mother of two suffers from mental health issues.

Rescue: Doyle and the boys, 2-year-old Nicodemus Doyle and 4-year-old Isaiah Hacket-Doyle were extracted hours after the crash by first responders 

The family were airlifted to area hospitals for treatment and were later released 

Close call: The woman and her two children, a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old, were found injured inside her overturned SUV resting on a beach near Fort Bragg, California, October 3 

Rambling rant: A day before the crash, Doyle wrote this paranoid Facebook status update accusing the Illumanti of trying to kill her family 

A day before the crash, Doyle wrote a rambling status update on her Facebook page claiming that a shadowy organization known as the Illuminati was out to get her and her sons.

'They have been threatening to kill us. I thought by taking down what I said before it would make them happy but they just want to kill my sons and I because of something we had no control of,' Doyle wrote. 

Advance warning: Doyle's mother contacted the authorities in August to warn them that her daughter might be suicidal 

'They started a show about me and it wasn't enough now they are going to kill me and my family (all of them). So please watch out for my brother and work to get them the justice they deserve for killing people who did nothing to them. Thanks.' 

Three weeks earlier, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office issued a bulletin warning law enforcement officials that the McKinleyville woman might be suicidal.

The warning went out after Doyle's mother contacted authorities saying she was concerned her daughter may harm herself or her children due to her mental problems.

The following day, August 14, Ms Doyle reached out to the sheriff's office herself and arranged a meeting with officials.

‘The deputy determined she was not having any mental health issues and she and the children were in good health,’ the Sheriff’s Office said in a press release. ‘She told the deputy she was in the process of moving out [of] the area with her children and her mother was upset about that.’
