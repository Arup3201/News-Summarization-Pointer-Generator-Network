Police are appealing to find a flasher who exposed himself twice to a roadside speed camera during boozy Australia Day celebrations.

Video footage released by Victoria Police shows a man taking off his clothes and climbing onto the front of a vehicle in the south-east Melbourne suburb of Rowville. 

Police said he was: ‘Exposing himself while yelling and screaming abuse at the operator inside.’

The man approached the mobile camera operator with a friend on Kelletts Road about 1.30pm on Monday 26 January.

He climbs onto the car's bonnet and sticks one hand in the air before thrusting his genitals, which have been 'starred out' by police in the video, at the camera.

The men, believed to be aged in their 30s walk away west along Kelletts Road and then returned about an hour later carrying alcohol.

With his beer in hand, he put on another show for the camera.
