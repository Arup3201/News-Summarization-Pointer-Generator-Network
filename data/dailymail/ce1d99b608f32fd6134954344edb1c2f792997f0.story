A middle-aged Tesco customer has been handed a restraining order banning him from being within five metres of a check-out girl after becoming 'irrationally fixated' with her. 

Photographer Nicholas Fenney, 56, developed a delusional view of his relationship with shop assistant Samantha Bryce, 22, after she served him in the store in Tetbury, Gloucester.

A court heard he had given her a calendar of his duck photographs at her checkout in an envelope with her name on, and had sent her a 'disgusting' Valentines card with rabbits on, telling her he 'loved her'.

She told Gloucester Crown Court that the first time she spoke to him he had handed her the envelope, which was addressed to her by first and second name, but she had never told him her second name and he had spelt it incorrectly.

Next time she saw him at her till he commented about the horse picture on her name badge and revealed that he knew she owned a grey horse, she said.

'That really freaked me out because my horse is a dappled grey but I had no idea how he knew that,' she said. 

'I tried to ignore it. When the transaction was finished he presented me with a piece of white paper when I gave him his receipt.

'The paper had his contact details on it. I alerted my parents about him that night.'

Her third encounter with him was some weeks later in early February when she got a text from a colleague telling her a Valentine card had arrived for her at work, she said.

'When I got to work I saw the card and it said "Samantha Janssen" on the envelope.

It also said "The petite blonde girl, half Danish."

'I'm not Danish so I don't know where he got that from. Although it said Jansen I am the only petite blonde Samantha in the store.

'The card inside had a picture of rabbits in bed doing God knows what. I thought it was disgusting. The insinuation in that card made me feel sick to my stomach.

'It had "I love you" written in pencil at the bottom of the card,'

A few days later, she said, she was told by her manager that Fenney had made a complaint to Tesco head office alleging he had heard staff calling her 'a mad b*tch' and a 'little sl*t' while reprimanding her.

A court heard he had given her a calendar of his duck photographs at her checkout in an envelope with her name on, and had sent her a 'disgusting' Valentines card with rabbits on, telling her he 'loved her' at the Tesco store in Tetbury 

But there had never been any such incident, she said. She had never been reprimanded or abused at work.

The court heard that in his letter to Tesco Fenney said: 'We have been trying to date one another for six months without success and there are complex personal issues involved.'

It was on hearing about his bizarre complaint that she called in the police and reported Fenney for stalking, she said.

Fenney, who describes himself on his website as a photographer, desktop publisher and French translator, was prosecuted for harassing Ms Bryce between 1st Dec 2013 and Feb 4th 2014 and was convicted by magistrates earlier this year.

But he appealed against his conviction to the crown court last Friday and his appeal was allowed - although the court said it accepted Ms Bryce's evidence and rejected Fenney's version of events.

Judge William Hart said the court found Fenney to be a 'delusional' and fixated fantastist' but his behaviour had not amounted to the legal definition of harassment or stalking.

Although the court allowed his appeal and quashed the harassment conviction it made a two year restraining order barring Fenney from contacting Ms Bryce in any way or going within five metres of her when shopping at the Tetbury Tesco.

In evidence, Fenney had claimed that Ms Bryce had once shouted at him loudly across the store suggesting he should ask her out on a date

He claimed she had seen his name on his Tesco Clubcard and looked up his website. Next time he saw her she told him she liked his photos of ducks so he took her the calendar, he said.

He denied putting her surname on the calendar, saying he did not even know her name at that time. 

Later, he said, she told him she was half Danish and when he put Janssen on the Valentine card it was just a guess at a Danish name.

And he claimed he had heard an incident when she was being abused in the store and he found it 'genuinely alarming' so he wrote to Tesco to complain.

Fenney, was convicted for harassing Ms Bryce. But he appealed against his conviction to Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) and his appeal was allowed - although the court said it accepted Ms Bryce's evidence and rejected Fenney's version of events 

Fenney said her evidence about him talking to her about her horse was false and 'off the wall.'

Allowing the appeal Judge Hart, who sat with two male magistrates, said: 'Samantha Bryce is 22. 

'Any objective observer would describe her undoubtedly as an extremely physically attractive young woman. The appellant, by contrast, is an ordinary looking man in his mid-fifties. That is not said to complain or condemn - it is just a statement of fact.

'We found Ms Bryce to be a believable and compelling witness. '

He said the court totally rejected Fenney's claim he had heard Ms Bryce being called a b*tch or sl*t.

'It is impossible to understand how any member of staff could refer to her as a little sl*t,' said the judge.

'Her demeanour and personality as we judge it is quite the opposite of that.

'This was indicative of the appellant's delusional view of his relationship with her. We unhesitatingly prefer her version of events wherever it differs from his.

'However although we find that his conduct did result in fear and distress to Ms Bryce one could not properly say that this was persistent conduct of a severely oppressive nature.

'What he has done is undoubtedly unattractive and unreasonable but does not cross the line into torment. For those reasons we allow his appeal.

'We find him to be someone who has formed and who still has a completely irrational interest in this innocent young woman. 

'He denies being fixated by this young woman but we have come to the view that unless he is subject to a restraining order he is likely to subject her to further conduct which will amount to harassment.'
