The controversial replacements for the Harrier jump jets may cost taxpayers even more than their £500million asking price - because the heat from take off could melt aircraft carriers' decks.

The fumes from the U.S. Joint Strike Fighters are so hot that special heat-resistant paint will be required to protect the take-off strip.

But American military experts are still developing the coating, which the Britain will now have to beg for as well as the new planes.

Takeoff: Fumes from the F-35 jump jet can damage ships' decks, US tests have revealed

The flaw is the latest problem to hit the ministry of defence's 6.2billion plan for two new aircraft carriers after scrapping the Ark Royal and selling off the Harriers.

It comes just two weeks after Defence Secretary Philip Hammond was forced into an embarrassing U-turn over the purchase of the new jets.

He scrapped plans to replace the Harriers with conventional F-35C planes, which take off from an runway, when the £2billion cost of fitting the new warships with catapult take-off systems was discovered.

The Government then had to revert to the previous Labour government's plan to purchase 12 F-35B 'jump jets', at a cost of up to £500million each.

The turnaround cost taxpayers an estimated £250million.

The new heat-resistant 'Thermion' coating has been developed in America after U.S. tests showed that exhausts from the jets could melt ships' decks.

Expense: The 170,000 square ft HMS Queen Elizabeth will have to be covered with heat-resistant paint

U-turn: The MoD committed to purchasing 12 £500m jump jets in an embarrassing turnaround this month

Wasted: The RAF's entire fleet of GR9A Harriers was refitted at a cost of millions just before Cameron's defence review scrapped the entire fleet and sold them to the U.S.

An MoD spokesman said the cost of the new paint would be 'negligible' and were 'greatly offset' by the savings from not fitting the £2billion 'cats and traps' to the aircraft carriers.

'Work to identify a suitable deck coat is ongoing so exact costs are not yet available,' the spokesman said.

The new aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, are set to be completed in 2020.

The project has been branded an 'omnishambles' by Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy.

A spokesman for the MOD said: 'The MoD will save £2BN by not fitting "cats and traps" and this will greatly offset the relatively small cost of specialist deck coating which has always been factored into our plans.

'Deck coating was always part of the STOVL variant ship specification. Work to identify a suitable deck coating paint is ongoing with our American partners in this project.'
