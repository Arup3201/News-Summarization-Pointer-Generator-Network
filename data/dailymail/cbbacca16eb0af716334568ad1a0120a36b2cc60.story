The actor, who has also appeared in The Bill, Holby City, Doctors and Family Affairs, has always denied the allegations

Soap star David Easter has spoken of his relief at being cleared of rape allegations as his lawyer accuses the alleged victim of trying to ‘cash in’ after the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The 54-year-old actor, who is the former husband of Loose Woman presenter Denise Welch, was accused of carrying out the assault 17 years ago by a woman now in her 40s.

He said today: 'I am relieved that this ordeal is now over and that I have been formally cleared.

'These allegations were always unfounded and I am focused now on my career, which has been understandably very difficult to manage over the last few months.'

Mr Easter was questioned by police in May as part of Operation Sapphire after the alleged victim spotted him playing Gil Keane in Emmerdale last December.

But officers have now said there is not enough evidence to prosecute.

Mr Easter’s lawyers now claim that the woman tried to use Operation Yewtree, which was launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, as a way of ‘cashing in’.

Lawyer Julian Lee told The Sun: ‘It was a 17-year-old allegation and the woman in question must have seen him on TV thousands of times during those years but she only waited until the Jimmy Savile bandwagon started and tried to cash in on it.

‘Thankfully it didn’t get anywhere – I hope David can get on with his life now.’

His agent,
 Mark Deitch, told MailOnline: ‘It is great news. We are, as is David, 
enormously relieved that this has been dropped and that no charges were 
brought against him.

‘He can now get on with his career.’

Mr
 Deitch was unable to confirm whether the actor would be making a return
 to Emmerdale after his last contract with the show ended in December.

He added: ‘He left before the allegations came to light when his contract was up at the end of last year.’

The actor, who has also appeared in The Bill, Holby City, Doctors and Family Affairs, has always denied the allegations.

He made his acting debut in the 1979 disco film The Music Machine, before playing Pat Hancock in the soap opera Brookside from 1984 to 1987.

Mr Easter married former Coronation street actress Denise Welch in 1985, but they divorced three years later.

He now lives with his long-term partner and five-year-old son in Hanwell, west London.
