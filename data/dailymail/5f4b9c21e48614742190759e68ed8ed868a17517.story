Dance teacher Nadia Wearn died hours after she was sent home from hospital after doctors failed to carry out the correct tests

A distressed mother died just hours after being sent home from A&E by a doctor who said her crippling pain was caused by holding her young daughter the wrong way.

The junior doctor prescribed Nadia Wearn painkillers, telling her that she was suffering from bad posture and a trapped nerve, possibly caused by holding her baby incorrectly.

But just over two hours after returning home the 31-year-old dance teacher collapsed and died from a heart attack in front of her family.

Her daughter Ava, who was just 13 weeks old when her mother died, has now been awarded damages after the hospital admitted liability.

Bosses said Mrs Wearn could have been saved if she had been tested more thoroughly.

The case comes two days after it emerged that a new blood test would help doctors spot ‘hidden’ heart attacks in women.

Mrs Wearn had complained of breathlessness and pains across her chest, abdomen and left arm when she visited South Tyneside Hospital in 2011. 

However, doctors failed to perform tests such as an ECG, which measures the heart’s electrical activity, and blood analysis. 

Both are commonly used to determine whether a patient is suffering cardio problems but diagnosis rates at A&E are significantly lower for women.

Soon after returning to her home in South Shields, Mrs Wearn collapsed as she sat next to her mother, Pauline Elleithy.

Miss Elleithy, who had 40 years’ nursing experience, desperately tried to revive her daughter but Mrs Wearn lost consciousness. She was taken to hospital and pronounced dead an hour later.

After the tragedy, Miss Elleithy said her daughter had complained about doctors dismissing her problems because of how she was holding Ava.

A court later found that the mother-of-one's life could have been saved if the correct tests were carried out

Mrs Wearn’s husband Jason, 38, and Ava, now three, were awarded undisclosed damages at the High Court this week.

South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust admitted liability and apologised for the failings.

After the hearing, the family’s solicitor Angela Curran said the trust agreed further tests should have been carried out.

‘Had those tests been undertaken, Nadia would still have been in hospital at the time of her cardiac arrest and in all likelihood would have been resuscitated,’ she said.

The damages will now be paid into the court and administered for Ava’s benefit. 

Mrs Wearn, who worked as a dance teacher at independent Newcastle High School for Girls, suffered from a hereditary blood condition as a child.

She went through several blood transfusions and surgery to remove her spleen at the age of eight.

But she overcame her health problems to enjoy an active adult life.

Dr Alan Rodgers, a medical director at South Tyneside District Hospital, said the hospital should have carried out more tests given the symptoms Mrs Wearn displayed.

‘In what Nadia presented, we were duty-bound to do more tests,’ he said.

A spokesman for the trust in charge of South Tyneside hospital said: 'We are extremely sorry about Nadia Wearn's tragic death'

Dr Soni Shrestha, who examined Mrs Wearn, told an inquest in 2012 that the findings from initial tests on the mother were ‘normal’. 

She said: ‘There was no indication for blood tests so I did not feel I had to do the blood tests. She did not appear anxious. All her vitals were fine.’

On Tuesday, it was revealed that a new £20 test that looks at levels of a protein produced by damaged heart cells could double the chances of spotting hidden heart attacks in women.

Existing checks are good at picking up cardiac trouble in men suffering chest pains, with a diagnosis rate of 19 per cent. However the rate for women is only 11 per cent.
