Airlines are on course to nose-dive into the red as the number of first and business class passengers are slashed across Europe because of economic turbulence, high taxes and cost-cutting, air industry bosses revealed today.

European carriers are expected to be worst affected and post combined losses of around £750million in 2012, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicted today.

The drop in lucrative First Class and Business Class travel mirrors the poor economic climate as firms cut costs by sending their executives in economy, or fly with low-cost budget airlines.

Cutbacks: Hard-pressed businesses are making more and more executives travel in economy class or with low cost airlines

Continental European countries hit by the eurozone debt and currency crisis are among the worst affected.

The forecast has intensified calls by British airlines to reduce or scrap completely UK’s controversial  Air Passenger Duty (APD) airport departure tax – dubbed the ‘poll-tax of the skies - which has increased steadily since its introduction in 1994.

IATA also hinted at the lack of a controversial Third runway at Heathrow which is bursting at the seams and operating at 99 per cent capacity as it noted: 'Not only is the economy weak with the eurozone crisis, Europe has some very unfriendly conditions for doing business—onerous regulations, high taxes, insufficient capacity at many key airports and an air traffic management system badly in need of modernization.’

IATA said  airlines in some countries were facing an ‘uphill struggle with high taxes, onerous regulation and insufficient infrastructure’.

It noted that in July, on the lucrative North Atlantic routes to and from the USA, first class and business class travel - known as premium travel - was 2.4% down on the same time last year.

But within Europe in July 2012 premium travel was down even more – by  3.5%.

'Poll-tax of the skies': The poor results will intensify calls for a reduction in UK Air Passenger Duty

IATA said: ‘European airlines are expected to post the largest loss of any region. While governments and the European Central Bank have taken measures to shore up confidence in the euro, these have been fraught with political difficulties.

‘Additionally, the region is plagued by high taxes, inefficient air traffic management infrastructure and an onerous regulatory environment.’

Overall, IATA predicted that world airline profits will reach around £2.56 billion in 2012 - a dip on the 2011 figure of around £5.25 billion in 2011 but higher than IATA’s forecast for this year made in June 2012.

Capacity: The report's criticisms will be siezed on by supporters of a third runway at Heathrow

Speaking in Singapore today, IATA director general and chief executive Tony Tyler said: ‘Aviation has an important role to play as the global economy struggles. Growth is the only way forward and a healthy aviation industry can stimulate that - linking stagnating developed economies to robust emerging markets.

‘Aviation connectivity spurs growth at both ends. That is why it is important for governments to ensure aviation’s ability to be a catalyst for growth is not constrained.

‘Unfortunately, in many parts of the world, it is an uphill struggle with high taxes, onerous regulation and insufficient infrastructure. All of this stunts industry growth to the detriment of the world economy.’

On a knife-edge: The airline industry has struggled to adapt to rising oil prices

He added:’Europe is among the regions most in need of the economic growth that aviation can provide. Yet we still see high taxes, cumbersome regulation and capacity constraints. There are lessons for Europe to learn from other parts of the world.’

Mr Tyler said that airlines were nevertheless doing well to cope with  the difficult economic times: ‘Even six years ago, generating a profit with oil at $110/barrel (Brent) would have been unthinkable. The industry has re-shaped itself to cope by investing in new fleets, adopting more efficient processes, carefully managing capacity and consolidating. But despite these efforts, the industry’s profitability still balances on a knife-edge, with profit margins that do not cover the cost of capital.’

He added:‘Aviation has an important role to play as the global economy struggles. Growth is the only way forward and a healthy aviation industry can stimulate that—linking stagnating developed economies to robust emerging markets.

Mixed fortunes: British Airways parent IAG says demand demand for premium leisure travel is up, but is heading towards a 'small operating loss' for 2012

British Airways’ parent company IAG, which also oversees Spain’s  Iberia,  said it did not  make specific  predictions on future premium traffic by region.

But it admitted it is heading towards ‘a small operating loss’ for this year.

It said it had bucked the trend in August and seen its global premium traffic rise by 12.6 per cent compared with last year. This, it said,  reflected British Airways’ successful commercial strategy to stimulate demand for first and business class leisure travel.

But in its trading outlook  disclosed on August  3  for its second quarter results, IAG reported: ‘We were previously targeting a break-even operating result this year, after the impact of restructuring costs and the short term earnings drag from the bmi acquisition.  However, in the light of the Spanish macro headwind, we now expect to make a small operating loss in 2012. ‘

Last month IAG added: ‘Underlying market conditions remain unchanged from guidance given at Quarter Two results. Trading conditions at our London hub remain firm. Performance at Madrid continues to be impacted by weak economic conditions, with short haul traffic particularly affected.’
