San Antonio regained the upper hand in the NBA Finals after blowing away the Miami Heat thanks to a stunning first-half performance in game three in Florida.

Having lost game two at home on Sunday, the Spurs responded with an emphatic statement to record a 111-92 victory on the road and take a 2-1 lead in the series.

The damage was done for San Antonio in the first half as they racked up 71 points, and a 21-point half-time lead.

Up and down: LeBron James scored 22 points but couldn't prevent Miami Heat losing to the San Antonio Spurs

Dunking: Kawhi Leonard scored 29 points and was one of five Spurs players to end in double figures

Tricky business: Not even the prowess of 22-point Dwyane Wade was enough for the Heat on Tuesday

The Spurs made 25 of their 33 shots in the opening two periods, a percentage of 75.8 per cent that ranks as the best seen in a single half in NBA Finals history.

Miami threatened a comeback in the third quarter as they closed the gap to seven points, helped by their raucous home crowd at American Airlines Arena.

But, after being held to 15 points in the third quarter, San Antonio regained control in the fourth and began to pull away once more.

After scoring just 18 points in games one and two combined, Kawhi Leonard exploded into life for the Spurs with 29 points including three 3-pointers.

San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said: ‘Kawhi was just himself. That's how he's played all year long. He's got that kind of talent.’

Danny Green (15), Tony Parker (15), Tim Duncan (14) and Manu Ginobili (11) also all reached double figures for San Antonio as their ball movement and unselfish shooting posed problems for Miami all night.

Ginobili said: 'There were no magic plays. We just moved the ball and everything went in. At the same time as that on offence, we were doing good on defence too. It was a great team effort.'

LeBron James and Dwyane Wade both scored 22 points for the Heat, but their defence was picked apart by a red hot Spurs team in the first half.

Game four takes place in Miami on Thursday.
