A Colorado couple was discovered dead on Sunday in a murder-suicide, it has emerged.

Chris Bankert, 26, shot his long-time girlfriend and high school sweetheart Kacey Heberlein, 23, before he turned the gun on himself, the Douglas County coroner's office said, according to Denver Westword.

Heberlein did not meet with a friend as planned Saturday, prompting police to look for her at Bankert's Castle Rock house, but police were not met by anyone inside the home, according to the wesbite.

The bodies were discovered the next day after a SWAT team was called by police and authorities went inside Bankert's home, Denver Westword reported.

Heberlein and Bankert first became a couple as Bear Creek High School students, the website said.

Though Heberlein did not graduate from Bear Creek High School, she received her degree through an online program in 2012, 9NEWS earlier reported.

The affiliate station noted that it doesn't seem Bankert earned a degree in the Jefferson County School District.

The home where she and Bankert were discovered was purchased by Bankert in June 2014, according to the affiliate station.

A friend of Heberlein's described her to 9NEWS as 'really funny, really down to earth, cool to hang around.'

The friend also said 'Everyone at work really liked her. Just a really fun person to be around.'

Heberlein's Facebook page says she started at Arapahoe Community College Foundation in June 2013, and as Denver Westword noted, says she became engaged to Bankert in 2010.
