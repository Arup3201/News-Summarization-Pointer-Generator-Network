A grieving father pictured in an iconic photograph from the Aurora shootings is leading the charge for gun control as memorials take place marking the one year anniversary of the massacre today.

When Alex Sullivan was one of 12 killed in the Aurora, Colorado shootings last year, his father Tom, was photographed and became a symbol of the devastation caused to families across the area. 

Today a 
candlelight vigil and a memorial service will be held in the suburban Denver town as campaigners continue to press for gun control.

'I think that Coloradans get it, that something must change, Sullivan told Time.

One of the more outspoken voices since the Aurora shootings, Sullivan has led a chorus of people calling for more stringent rules around gun sales and universal background checks, according to Time, which noted that Colorado is the only state since the Aurora massacre to scale back its gun controls.

Sullivan has also helped other families 
cope with the tragedy by helping to start Aurora Rise, a Batman-themed charity, 
and helping families return to the theater like he does as often as 
possible – sitting next to the seat his son died in, according to the 
Daily Beast.

Started after a fundraising event that attracted donations from comic book enthusiasts and artists around the country – including DC Comics – earned $22,000, Aurora Rise’s mission is to ‘make the days ahead of those affected… a little bit brighter.’ Sullivan and his daughter were invited by founder Jason Farnsworth to be board members, according to the Daily Beast.

Farnsworth, the owner of a local comic book store, and Sullivan came up with the idea of a series of sketches depicting comic book heroes guarding the entrance to Aurora’s Century 12 Theater, though sold online and at charity events for $7.20, it became invaluable to one survivor almost instantly. 

The idea for the sketchbook was born out of Sullivan wanting to cheer up a 12-year-old boy who had been part of his deceased son’s group in the theater the night of the shooting, Sullivan told the Daily Beast.

Having met the boy during his son’s casket viewing and remembering how a copy of Green Lantern he gave the boy helped him cope, Sullivan asked a local artist to make a sketch of the Green Lantern standing guard over the theater entrance, as if to tell the boy it was time go back to the movies, that idea turned into a sketchbook now sold online and at charity events, according to the charity’s site.

Saturday marks the one year anniversary since James Holmes' walked into the Century theater armed to the teeth and wearing tactical gear as he opened fire on moviegoers watching 'The Dark Knight Rises.' The shooting rampage left 12 dead and dozens injured, that more people didn't die was hailed at the time as a miracle by local officials.

A candlelight vigil held late Friday 
night attracted several residents of the grief-stricken town, many 
visibly distraught, all still wanting to know why this happened.

Calling for a 'day of meaningful remembrance, continued healing and positive community actions,' the city of Aurora has several events planned for the one year anniversary.

Saturday began with a memorial ceremony attended by Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper and Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan, survivors, victims' families and locals who all were handed cream colored roses.

Remembrance: Reeve Mooneyham, 18 months, wears a Batman shirt as he plays with a rose at Saturday's memorial ceremony in Aurora, CO.

Saying that one senseless act will not define his city, Mayor Hogan assured those in attendance that 'Aurora will never forget what happened to our community. We will never stop caring for victims of that horrible evening.'

Referring to both victims' families and survivors, Hogan said that 'as a community, we're past that grieving part. Now we're into that healing, but there needs to be a reminder that healing doesn't occur in the same way with everybody.'

Speaking before reading the names of the
12 victims, Hickenlooper told the hundreds in attendance that memories 
should not just be of the tragedy, but that people should also 'focus on
the actions that happened in those days after the shooting.

A bell tolled 12 times, once for each victim, and a high school choir sang 'Amazing Grace' and a local band, with a lead singer who lives a stone's throw from the theater, according to the Denver Post, played a remembrance song.
