A federal judge refused to set bail on Thursday for a New Jersey man charged in the notorious ‘cannibal cop’ case after a prosecutor said he discussed raping an infant during an online chat.

Michael Van Hise, 22, told an unidentified person he met online that he wanted to ‘do the newborn,’ Manhattan federal prosecutor Randall Jackson said.

Federal Judge William Pauley III said 
the allegations against Van Hise represented ‘really shocking, 
depraved and violent conduct.’

‘The conduct is so far beyond the pale, and presents such a great danger to the community, that there is no set of conditions the court can conceive of that could be set for bail for the defendant,' he said.

Defense lawyer Alice Fontier had attempted to explain away Van Hise's online conversations as pure fantasy and not something he ever intended to act upon, reports the New York Post.

Fontier told the judge on that Van Hise didn't mean anything he wrote on the darkfetishnet.com website that he frequently visited.

She also noted that after signing up to the website, which has more than 37,000 members, she had received a barrage of emails from people ‘offering to hang me, torture me, rape me, eat me.’

It was unclear if the child allegedly discussed during the chat was one of Van Hise's own. He and his wife, Bolice, have a 2-year-old son and a daughter born last month.

murder her after they met on the site.

Valle, 28, was denied bail by a federal appeals court on Tuesday. Charged with conspiring to rape, kill and eat women, he is now set for trial next month.

Further gruesome details about Van Hise's plans were revealed at a magistrates hearing earlier this month.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman heard how Van Hise had sent a photo of his wife’s seven-year-old niece to two people in an internet chat room, offering her and her nine-year-old sister for rape.

Prosecutor Assistant U.S. Attorney Randall Jackson alleged that Van Hise had similar plans for his own stepdaughter, whose identity has not been revealed for legal reasons.

Referring to the online message, posted on Yahoo.com, Jackson said: 'The three-year-old (stepdaughter) he wants to keep as his sex slave.'

He allegedly also posted the street in Hamilton, New Jersey, on which the girls live, adding: 'We can engage in other activities [with them]', the court was told.

Jackson said Van Hise told an FBI agent that he and Valle were 'serious' about their plans to kidnap and rape a woman before admitting he was sexually aroused around children.

Van Hise's estranged wife, Bolise, 22, defended him as a 'big teddy bear', adding: 'They make him out to be a monster. He’s not. He’s as hard-core as a baby.'

The alleged plot was unearthed after Valle's estranged wife Kathleen Mangan, 28, tipped off police when she found sick internet messages detailing plans to abduct, rape, cook and eat 100 female victims.

Files found on the father of one’s computer included one titled: ‘Abducting and Cooking Victim I: A Blueprint’. It listed materials required including chloroform and rope as well as chronicling the practicalities of fitting a victim into an oven – her legs, he noted, would have to be bent.

Valle also expressed a desire to cook one particular victim slowly – ‘tying her onto some form of apparatus’ and trying to ‘keep her alive as long as possible’.

In a particularly chilling section of the internet transcripts read out in Manhattan Federal Court during his bail hearing, Valle shared his hunger for ‘girl meat’ on Thanksgiving in an email exchange with an alleged co-conspirator.

His defense maintain these were nothing but fantasies and have pointed out that no women were hurt, although among his named ‘victims’ are women whom the FBI have established did indeed know Valle.

Two of them claim to have been ‘stalked in an intimidating way’ by the police officer, who served in Harlem for six years.

Valle plead not guilty to all charges, including illegally accessing the National Criminal Database to search out potential victims. He has been held without bail and if convicted faces life imprisonment.
