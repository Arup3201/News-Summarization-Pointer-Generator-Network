Devastated: Westlife singer Shane Filan, seen performing in Liverpool last night, is 'devastated' after he was declared bankrupt

He has sold more than 45million records as part of the boyband Westlife.

But singer Shane Filan has been declared bankrupt after his property empire crumbled.

The decision came after the 32-year-old was revealed to have debts of £18million.

Speaking to the Mirror Shane said: 'I 
have worked long and hard to try to reduce my debts, and I am devastated
that it came to this conclusion.'

Confirming the sad news, Irish heartthrob Shane explained he had spoken to several bankruptcy experts in an attempt to find a solution to his financial issues, but his efforts had failed.

Shane added that he would be concentrating on his commitments with Westlife, who are currently completing their final tour.

He said that after the tour has finished, he will be 'looking to rebuild a future for my wife, my 
three children and myself'.

Before the economic crisis hit, Shane and his brother Finbarr had borrowed millions from several banks in their native Ireland.

Their company Shafin developments had taken out a series of large loans to construct a 90-home estate in Dromahair, Co.Leitrim.

However, out of the 90 houses planned, only half of them were actually constructed - with many selling for less than they had cost to build.

At the end of last year, Shane made the decision to relocate from Ireland to Surrey so that his finances could be dealt with in the UK.

His bankruptcy could have lasted up to 12 years in Ireland but will last just one year if he complies with the rules.

After the boom of the Celtic Tiger in
the mid-2000s, the global recession hit Ireland hard as many who 
used cheap credit to take out mortgages suffered badly in the economic 
downturn.

The property booms in Ireland and Spain, built on a mountain of debt, were far bigger than anywhere else and saw the biggest slumps after lending collapsed and debts were called in during the credit crunch. In Ireland, vast estates remain half-built and new-builds stand empty.

Since the crash in 2007-2008, average house prices in the country have fallen by more than 60 per cent with commercial properties falling at a similar rate.

Bankruptcy rules in England and Wales were made more 'progressive' in 2004, making the process less onerous.

Bankrupts can be discharged within 12 months - and as little as four months. This compares with three years before, or two years when the debts came to less than £20,000.

You can apply to a court, and pay £700, to make yourself bankrupt. Your creditors can force you into bankruptcy if you owe more than £750. The order normally lasts up to one year, or until the court appointed trustee can decide what can be claimed from your assets to clear what you owe.

Your bank account may be frozen with a living allowance being agreed.Your home, car and other assets may be seized to clear your borrowing. Pensions are usually excluded.

Certain debts will remain even after bankruptcy: court fines, child maintenance and student loans. If your assets are insufficient, you might have to make monthly payments, if you can afford it, for three years.

A note remains on the credit files of bankrupts for six years, making it difficult to borrow money.

Debt Relief Orders (DRO), a simplified and cheaper alternative to bankruptcy, was introduced in 2009. It lasts for 12 months, after which, if their circumstances have not changed, the debt is written off. It costs just £90.

A survey at the beginning of the year
which looks at the performance of the world's mainstream housing 
markets placed Ireland firmly at the bottom.

At the end of March data from the 
Central Statistics Office revealed that residential property prices fell
by almost 18 per cent in the year to February.

At the end of last year, The Irish 
Taoiseach revealed tough new austerity measures including hiking VAT to 
23 per cent in a bid to save €3.8billion.

Enda Kenny pledged to get Ireland's budget deficit under an EU limit of 3 per cent of GDP by 2015 and said this budget would be the toughest in a four-year run of belt-tightening.

The proposals included rises in indirect taxes - including a 2 per cent hike in VAT, increases in excise duty, cuts in social welfare and reduced child benefit.

It also featured an increase in VAT, as well as a new property tax, taxes on luxury items and raising the pension age.

The property crash has also resulted 
in more than 1,600 ghost estates, with houses completely abandoned, 
across Ireland, including the Glenall development in Borris-in-Ossory, 
Co. Laois.

Westlife have scored 14 number one singles in the UK and more than two dozen top 10 hits.

In 2010, the group were estimated to 
have amassed a £31million fortune after shifting more than 44 million 
copies of their records around the world.

The group will bring to an end their 14-year career with a show at Croke Park in Dublin on June 23.

Following the end of Westlife, Shane will be concentrating on releasing his own solo album next year.

The group's manager Louis Walsh told the Mirror: 'Shane is going to have a massive career after Westlife.

'He’s 
going to have a great solo career and make millions. He’ll start all 
over again and remake the riches in no time at all.'

'He had no money when he started off before Westlife, and now he’ll make it all back when he becomes a massive star.'

Filan is just the latest celebrity to go bust due to property debts.

Many footballers, in particular, have been caught out as new developments have been left empty due to the slump in house prices.

Jason Euell, 33, who earned £6million over his career, which started at Wimbledon, but suffered from the collapse of a property investment and was declared bankrupt.

Others invested their money in films, largely because of the tax breaks, but these high-risk punts have failed to pay off.

Former England player and Aston Villa favourite Lee Hendrie was declared bankrupt in January after film and property investments failed.

The 34-year-old, who earned £24,000 a week at the peak of his career,  owed HM Revenue & Customs £200,000 in unpaid tax.

He had unsuccessfully tried to sell his £1.7million home in Solihull but officials discovered in any case that the mortgage exceeded the property's value.

Grant Bovey, husband of TV presenter Anthea Turner and failed buy-to-let investor, was discharged from bankruptcy last year - just a year after his property company collapsed with debts of £50m.

The 50-year-old entrepreneur managed to hold on to some of his lavish lifestyle, staying in a pretty cottage in Hascombe, Surrey, owned by his wife and the couple managed to keep their £4m French ski chalet.

Other high profile bankruptcies have included former Atomic Kitten singer and reality TV star Kerry Katona and TV presenter Miquita Oliver, aged 27, who faced a £170,000 unpaid tax bill.

Katona finally cleared her debts at the end of last year after being declared bankrupt in 2008 - it normally only takes one year to be discharged but she had failed to comply with the order.
