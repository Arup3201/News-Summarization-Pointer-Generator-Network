It must have been holy water that made Madonna and Child appear in the form of a giant bubble.

Jenny Heller, 44, captured the phenomenon – blown on a beach by a teenage boy - while snapping away with friends on holiday in Dunwich, Suffolk.

It was only when she arrived home in London and downloaded the photographs onto her computer that she instantly recognised the artwork of the Virgin Mary and Jesus, painted by Guido Reni in 1628.

She told the Mail: ‘A family nearby had a giant bubble making machine and they were blowing bubbles.

‘It was blind luck that I was there snapping away when the bubble just blew past us.

‘When I downloaded the photographs I never thought we would see something divine as there was so much wind and it wasn’t obvious what the image was.

‘But once I saw the photograph on the screen I recognised it immediately to be Madonna and Child in a giant soap bubble. It is extraordinary.’
