Kylie Radatti, 34, was given a six month jail sentence after she upset a stranger's child by spinning them too fast on a merry-go-round

A woman who upset a stranger's child by spinning them too fast on a merry-go-round has been given a six month jail sentence.

Kylie Jean Radatti, 34, was attending the Bongo Beat event at a Gold Coast park on Sunday where she was playing with a number of children at a public playground.

Ms Radatti asked a four-year-old boy if he wanted a turn but when she began spinning him around the boy became upset and screamed, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

On Monday, she pleaded guilty to one count of public nuisance and was handed a six month jail sentence but was released on parole.

Ms Radatti said she told the four-year-old she was going to go fast before he jumped on the merry-go-round at Justins Park in Burleigh Heads.

'He said he'd have a go. He had a bit of a scream then he got off and the other kids jumped on and off we went,' she told the Bulletin.

'There was one family that decided they wanted to ring the police and they hunted me down and handcuffed me in front of everyone.'

In Southport Magistrates Court, Prosecutor Ben Fotheringham told the court Ms Radatti spun the playground ride and caused the child to scream for help, adding that he was 'incredibly distressed' by being spun around fast.

Ms Radatti's solicitor said the Burleigh Waters woman was 'heavily intoxicated' at the time but that the matter did not involve violence.

'This is possibly what could best be described as poor decision making, but no other parents were opposed to this,' he said.

Magistrate Dermot Kehoe said Ms Radatti had risked injuring the four-year-old boy, and that she should not have been playing with strangers' children.

Court documents show Ms Radatti has a criminal history dating back to 2005.

She was convicted of a number of other offences including assault occasioning bodily harm, assaulting or obstructing a police officer, breaching probation and bail conditions, and other public nuisance offences.
