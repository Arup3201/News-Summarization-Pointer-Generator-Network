A teenage girl whose family claimed she was bullied to death by cyber-bullies after she committed suicide probably trolled herself, an inquest heard today.

Hannah Smith, 14, was found hanged in her bedroom by her older sister at her home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire, on August 2 last year.

Her father David Smith, 45, maintained that his daughter was driven to suicide by internet bullies posting vile messages on social networking site AskFM. 

Detectives believe troubled Hannah Smith, 14, sent herself abuse messages on ask.fm, before hanging herself last August at the family home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire

Dozens of abusive anonymous messages were found on Hannah's Ask.fm profile following her death - raising fears she had been targeted by trolls

But a police investigation into the 
death uncovered no evidence that she was the victim of internet 
bullying, an inquest has been told.

Asked
 by Leicester and South Leicestershire coroner Catherine Mason if there 
was 'any evidence' that Hannah Smith was subjected to cyber-bullying, 
Detective Sergeant Wayne Simmons said: 'No, there isn't.'

Det
 Sgt Simmons, of Leicestershire Police, added that on the 'balance of 
probabilities' the 'vile' messages about Hannah on the social media site
 were posted by the teenager herself in the run-up to her death on 
August 2 last year.

The inquest heard that Hannah had been attacked at a party in the months leading up to her death.

At the hearing at Leicester Town Hall, her father David Smith said his daughter had been bullied for some time and that he believed her eczema had been the reason she was targeted, adding that she would try to avoid getting changed in front of classmates.

Describing his daughter as 'self-confident', he said that after attending a party in March 2013, she was attacked by a former friend and afterwards 'her behaviour seemed to change' from that of a 'bubbly, happy' person to a more introverted young girl.

'She went to a party and had her head smashed against a wall, twice,' Mr Smith told the coroner.

He
 said his daughter, who attended Lutterworth High School, had also taken
 to spending more time in bed and was late for class about once a week 
but he put this down to her being what he jokingly referred to as 'a 
lazy teenager'.

Mr Smith 
said he had also spoken to his daughter about self-harming, but she had 
never raised the subject of wanting to take her own life.

Hannah's older sister Joanne Smith said on one occasion she had 'ripped out the hair' of a person she believed was bullying her sister at school and said her younger sibling had been targeted throughout years seven, eight and nine.

She added that whenever there was trouble, Hannah or her friends would alert her and she would 'deal with it'.

Describing the night of her sister's death, Miss Smith, 17, said she had been out late with friends and on arriving home had invited them all in.

They then decided to go and wake Hannah as a prank.

'My friend opened her bedroom door and said the little light was on but he couldn't see her,' said Miss Smith.

'We thought 'she's got to be around, and she'll probably jump out around the door and scare us'.

'Then I turned around and saw her.'

Earlier the inquest had heard that a pathologist's report had given the cause of death as hanging.
