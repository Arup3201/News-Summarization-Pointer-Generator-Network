Four in 10 doctors warned about their fitness to practice are from abroad, it has emerged.

The General Medical Council has issued ‘undertakings’ – the final sanction short of striking them off – to 476 doctors.

But amid a crackdown on doctors unable to speak English properly, it can revealed that 43 per cent of those sanctioned are from overseas.

 Doctors who fail to show they have ‘improved’ can then be referred to the Medical Pactitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) - which can strike them off

The GMC has released a list of the 476 doctors in the UK currently ‘on undertakings’ after concerns were raised about their conduct.

It means they have allowed the doctor to continue to treat patients, but under strict supervision and a raft of restrictions.

Undertakings are seen as a ‘final chance’ rather than strike doctors off the Medical Register.

A Freedom of Information request reveals that there are 476 doctors in the UK still working ‘on undertakings’ - with 43 per cent having been trained abroad.

In total 135 (28 per cent) of the doctors are from countries outside Europe, 66 (14 per cent) from EU countries, six from non-EU European counties (one per cent) and 269 (57 per cent) from the UK.

That means 207 of the doctors currently working under supervision are from abroad - a total of 43 per cent.

GMC rules state: ‘Where a doctor’s registration is subject to conditions or undertakings which restrict their practice they will still be entitled to hold a licence but must continue to adhere to any conditions or undertakings imposed on their registration.

‘If they do not, their licence and registration will be at risk.’

According to the GMC website, doctors who fail to show they have ‘improved’ can then be referred to the Medical Pactitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) - which can strike them off.

It states: “Doctors with undertakings as a result of deficient performance are likely to be required to undergo a performance assessment before they are discharged from any undertakings.

“If the doctor does not agree to the undertakings, or if the doctor subsequently fails to comply with the undertakings, the case will be referred to the MPTS for a fitness to practise panel hearing.”

New rules which came into force this summer will allow h

ealth regulators in charge of the UK's 1.4million health workers to bar professionals simply because their command of the English language is considered so poor as to 'impair their fitness to practise'.

The Law Commission's new draft Bill covers nine bodies ranging from the General Medical Council (GMC) to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). Social workers in England will also be covered.
