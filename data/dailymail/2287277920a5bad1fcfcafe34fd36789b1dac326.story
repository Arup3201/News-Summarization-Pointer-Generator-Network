A world-first study will use Facebook as an early intervention tool to help prevent people with Bipolar from lapsing into manic episodes.

The Facebook use in Affective Disorders study will analyse the changes in social media use by an individual before and during a bipolar relapse.

If the first part of the trial proves that the Facebook monitoring helps to avert people from experiencing relapses then an application will be designed for users to download.

People with bipolar can sign up to be part of a trial that monitors their behaviour patterns on Facebook to help prevent relapses

Users will have the option of an alert being sent to them, their doctor, a family member or friend if their social media pattern starts to suggest a possible relapse could occur.

The Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre (MAPrc) and School of Intelligent Systems at RMIT is being launched today by beyondblue chairman Jeff Kennett.

MAPrc Professor Paul Fitzgerald said the idea for the trail came about when patients were observed to have a change in social media patterns around the time of deterioration in their condition.

People with Bipolar disorder who use social media can show signs of their condition deteriorating when their posts and interaction become 'excessively social' .

The excessive behaviour is often a telltale sign that the person could be entering a manic stage

‘People with Bipolar disorder, particularly when they become manic, tend to become excessively socially engaged – the nature of the illness itself is very social, so that is a reason why we think Facebook usage is likely to increase above and beyond other forms of usage,’ he told the MailOnline.

This information will becollected to see if it is possible to predict an episode of mania by analysing changes in Facebook use.

Data on previous relapse episodes will be collected and compared to current data in order to have an accurate image of how Facebook use varies during a relapse episode.

This information is collected to see if there is a link between how the person uses Facebook and their mood at the time of use.

The study, which runs for 12 months, is looking for participants with bipolar aged between 18 and 30 who use Facebook.
