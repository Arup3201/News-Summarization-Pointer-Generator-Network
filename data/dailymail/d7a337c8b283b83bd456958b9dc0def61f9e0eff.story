LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling is certainly no stranger to allegations of racially charged incidents nor sordid sexual scandal.

Indeed, back in 2003 the billionaire real estate mogul was a regular client of a $500-an-hour prostitute, Alexandra Castro, regularly seeking her advice on team matters.

The Beverly Hills woman, who the-then 70-year-old Sterling described as a 'freak' with whom he had sex with 'all over my building, in my bathroom, upstairs, in the corner, in the elevator', was eventually sued by the Clipper's boss to get a home back he gifted her in 2003.

Controversy: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been in and out of the news over the past decade facing allegations of racism

Labeling her a 'piece of trash', Sterling described his relationship with Castro as 'purely sex for money, money for sex, sex for money, money for sex.'

'The girl was providing sex for money. ... I probably didn't tell my wife ... maybe I did something morally wrong.

'When you pay a woman for sex, you are not together with her,' he further testified.

'You're paying her for a few moments to use her body for sex. Is it clear? Is it clear?'

Lastest lawsuit: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling and Vanessa Stiviano, who is being sued by Sterling's estranged wife Rochelle for $1.8 million and who allegedly recorded him making racist remarks

The graphic testimony from Sterling was included in a 2009 lawsuit the real estate mogul launched to have the home returned to him from Castro.

Having previously denied that they had a three-year relationship with Castro from 1999 to 2002, Sterling changed his testimony for the 2009 case.

In explicit detail he recalled sexual encounters he spent with Castro, who Sterling said was expert in bed and whose 'best sex was better than words could express.'

During the relationship which reportedly lasted between 1999 and 2002, the Los Angeles Clippers owner had transferred the title of a Beverly Hills home he owned to Castro and her mother.

However Castro won the case in 2003 and kept the property, according to the report.

Speaking in 2009, Castro said  'During our relationship, Mr Sterling consulted me on issues he was considering almost every day including, among others, whether he should hire Alvin Gentry to coach the Los Angeles Clippers (although I had no experience in such matters).'

She added that he asked her: '..how he should respond to requests by players for the Los Angeles Clippers for increases in their compensation (Mr. Sterling and I often had dinner at the Arena Club with agents for a number of players)'

In addition her attorney Raymond Hersh said in a deposition about their relationship that; 'She cooked, drove, cleaned, was consulted on remodeling apartments, who went to dinner with agents, who should be hired -she didn’t make the decision, she said, but she was consulted about who to hire in the Clipper organization and what should be done, what he was thinking.'

That very same year, the US Department of Justice sued Sterling for racial discrimination in housing minorities in some of his properties in Los Agneles.

He agreed to a $2.76 million settlement that alleged discrimination against African Americans, Latinos and children at apartment buildings he owned.

Sterling denied all the charges leveled by the Justice Department and in two other lawsuits brought by former tenants.

They alleged that property managers hired by Sterling would user racial slurs against them and would lose rent checks and then claim that they had not paid.

In the settlement, Sterling did not admit any liability.

However, it was Sterling's conduct as revealed in a lawsuit in 2003 that brought accusations of racism and sexism.

Deadspin reprinted court depositions from 2009, which included the allegations from Sumner Davenport, one of Sterling's property supervisors that he wanted to cultivate a stern and intolerant image.

Davenport said that mean, 'no black, no Mexican-Americans, no children and government-housing-subsidy recipients as tenants.'

According the testimony of some of his tenants in 2003, Sterling 'made life difficult for residents.

'They refused rent checks, then accused renters of nonpayment. They refused to do repairs for black tenants and harassed them with surprise inspections, threatening residents with eviction for alleged violations of building rules.'

Sterling allegedly made a shocking remark when he walked into a newly acquired building he had bought that had African-American tenants.

'That's because of all the blacks in this building, they smell, they're not clean,' he said, according to Davenport's testimony.

'And it's because of all of the Mexicans that just sit around and smoke and drink all day.'

The allegations included Sterling’s properties not renting to non-Koreans in Koreatown or African Americans in Beverly Hills.

According to the lawsuit, Sterling believed Korean-American tenants 'will live in whatever conditions he gives them and still pay the rent without complaint.'

Donald Sterling’s affair with the girl who exposed him as a racist on Friday wasn’t ‘his first rodeo’ and the LA Clippers owner’s wife is the person ‘least fooled and least affected by his ‘grotesque lifestyle’, explosive court papers reveal.

Vanessa Stiviano’s lawyer set out a strident defense after Rochelle Sterling sued her for embezzling $1.8m – the total gifts and cash Sterling, 80, is said to have given his 31-year-old lover – including a condo, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover.

He said: ‘This is an action brought by a very angry wife whose husband is a highly public figure and who is well known to the 'keeping women' other than his wife and who has done so for very many years with a big toothy grin brandishing his sexual prowess in the faces of the Paparazzi and caring less what anyone else thought, the least of which, his own wife’.

The papers, in which Rochelle claims Stiviano has been having sex with Sterling since 2010, went on: ‘Donald Sterling has flaunted that grotesque lifestyle in front of and in his wife’s face for nearly their entire marriage of 50 years.

The person least fooled and least affected and least “robbed of her due” is Rochelle Sterling.

‘At minimum, she has been complicit for over 50 years and, here, particularly, has “looked the other way” if not put hands over her mouth, covered her eyes and attempted to cover her ears. Further, this is not the “first rodeo” as the expression goes.’

Stiviano’s lawyer, Mac E Nehoray continued: ‘It is clear from past conduct, that Mrs Sterling has at a minimum, either “enabled” Donald Sterling to do, over and over again what he does, or that she approved of the varied and many gifts as described in the complaint.

‘The “relationship” (whatever it may have been or not been) between Donald Sterling and V Stiviano was open, notorious, obvious and long standing.’

Elsewhere in the papers, he said: ‘Instead of chastising her philandering husband, let alone curtailing his carousing, Mrs Sterling seeks to punish Stiviano who has done nothing wrong.’

The news come as it emerged Sterling's his estranged wife Shelly Sterling dined with the NBA boss just hours after calling his comments despicable in a public statement.

'Our family is devastated by the racist comments made by my estranged husband,' Mrs Sterling said in a statement Sunday night.

'My children and I do not share these despicable views or prejudice. We will not let one man’s small mindedness poison the spirit of the fans and accomplishments of the team in the city we love.'

But according to the New York Post, soon after the pair were spotted leaving Fleming's steakhouse in LA.

When asked by a paparazzo 'Are you a racist, Mr. Sterling?' Shelly screamed that it was all untrue.
