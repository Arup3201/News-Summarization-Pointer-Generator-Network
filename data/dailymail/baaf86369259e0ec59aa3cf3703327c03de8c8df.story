'As the Louis Vuitton show notes stated: "Today is a new day. A big day",' says fashion expert Simon Glazin.

'Nicolas Ghesquiere, formally of Balenciaga, wrote them to welcome the 1000-strong audience witnessing his first collection for the fashion house that Marc Jacobs built.

'And it certainly was a new dawn. The first few looks had something uniquely Nicolas about them. His hand at turning a skirt or a zip-up into something uber cool translated here. Tiny waists were exaggerated with twisted belts and statement pockets - both features present throughout most of the collection.

'Emphasis on necklines meant you looked from top-to-bottom of each look, which, for a designer, is something you hope for from eager editors. Big winged collars, roll-necks and plunged lines were all there.

'Something resolutely 70s was the 
undertone to this collection. Thick floral prints, A-line shapes and 
various rich brown hues that remind me of Abigail's Party.

'A
 fabulous mix of textures - another technique that Nicolas brings with 
him from his Balenciaga years - created some stand-out pieces: those 
leather and tweed dresses (celebrity frocks for sure) and the shine of 
patent teamed with the matte of a roll-neck jumper.

'What we got here was something fresh and cool. Marc bought the glamour and sequins, Nicolas brings the future'

Sexy leather and deep plunge necklines also took centre stage as sixties and seventies hues reigned supreme
