A woman who plunged to her death from a bridge with her father and their pet Chihuahua had dreamed of becoming a model before battling with depression, her mother has revealed.

More details have emerged hinting at what could have sparked the suicides at Bond Bridge in Kansas City, Missouri on Thursday morning.

The father, who is believed to be in his 50s, and his 29-year-old daughter have still not been identified as her mother does not wish to name them and police have not released the details.

The pair, who lived together at a mobile home in Peculiar, jumped from the bridge while hand-in-hand and carrying their dog. They fell 120 feet to the water and their bodies have not been recovered.

The woman's mother, who divorced her 
husband two decades ago, said her daughter had struggled with depression
 but was happy in recent months and had been planning activities for the
 summer.

She said she was stunned by
 the fact that her ex-husband joined his daughter in jumping from the 
bridge, as he had been so instrumental in helping her get through her 
depression.

'This has literally blown me away,' the mother told the Kansas City Star, adding that her ex-husband had also previously suffered from depression. 'I'm just numb.'

She told the Star that her daughter 
was slender and six-feet tall and had dreamed of becoming a model - but
that they had been unable to afford her portfolio.

Friends remember how she worked 
different jobs after high school, but she quit when co-workers were mean
 to her. One friend told the Star that she simply did not learn things 
as quickly as others.

She began working as a babysitter and thrived at the job, her mother said.

But around 18 months ago, she had a 'dark period' and spoke of suicide, friend Ryan Wheale said.

'I tried to talk her out of it,' he said. 'But she wouldn't change her mind. She seemed at peace with it.'

Afterwards, she cut out many of her friends and started to take medication.

Her mother said she thought things began to get better and was planning fundraising events for the summer and told her mother she would download Skype so they could talk more.

Investigation: Authorities have not yet suggested why the father and his daughter jumped from the bridge

'She didnâ€™t seem to be in that state of 
mind, not when sheâ€™s texting about doing something that she thought 
would be so fun,' the mother said. 'There's no note. No nothing. I'm 
lost.'

Authorities called off the search for the pair hours after they were seen jumping from the Bond Bridge at 11.35 a.m. on Thursday.

Witnesses said they saw the two people get out of their truck, climb over the railing on the bridge and jump to the water 120 feet below, the Kansas City Star reported.

Police say the woman was holding 
something in a blanket that initially was thought to be a baby but more 
likely was the family's Chihuahua-mix, named Skeeter.

Authorities were granted a search 
warrant for the vehicle on Thursday night but found nothing inside apart
 from the father's cellphone. The truck was towed by police.

Emergency workers scoured the river by boats for more than an hour, while the Kansas City Fire Department put spotters on the Chouteau Bridge and at Interstate 435 for a view over the river.

The Missouri Highway Patrol estimated the water's temperature was in the 40s, but Jeff Grote from the Kansas City Fire Department said people are less likely to drown in cold water than warm water.

But a fire spokesman told FOX 4 that when someone jumps off a bridge, they typically do not resurface and tend to travel for miles under water before resurfacing.
