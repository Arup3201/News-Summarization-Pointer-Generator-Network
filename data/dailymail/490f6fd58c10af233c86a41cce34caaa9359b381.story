Its a brand famous for delicate porcelain figurines and crockery elegant enough to please the pickiest of decor fanatics but even Royal Doulton hasn't escaped the graffiti trend.

The latest collection from the iconic British tableware brand, which has supplied crockery to the Royal Family, focuses on street art and offers designs that range from colourful spray cans to a man throwing paint.

But while street art is free, the new crockery collection doesn't come cheap with mugs starting at £18 while plates cost an eye-watering £60 each.

New look: Royal Doulton's latest collection is a far cry from its trademark porcelain figurines

The unusual products have been created by cutting-edge artists Charles Uzzell Edwards and Nick Walker, who teamed up to design the special collection.

It includes eight 27cm limited edition plates, seven mugs and two collections of four 17cm plates, showcasing classic British design and progressive art.

Edwards, 45, a graffiti specialist better known as Pure Evil and a descendant of Henry VIII's chancellor, Sir Thomas More, is behind four of the designs: 'Bunny Fingers', 'Pure Evil in the Pillory', 'Beautiful Thing' and 'Marilyn Marlene Dali'.

Speaking about the project, the artist said: 'I like the heritage of Royal Doulton and what they stand for.'

The other four designs are by Bristol-based Walker, 45, and are called 'Love Vandal', 'Vandal Airways', 'The Morning After New' and 'Collage'.

Royal Doulton, based in Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, was established almost 200 years ago in 1815.

It holds Royal Warrants by Appointment for tableware and giftware for The Prince of Wales and Her Majesty The Queen.

A Royal Doulton spokeswoman added: 'The limited edition of large plates reinvigorates the concept of using ceramic as an interior design art form.

'These are pieces to be displayed and are bound to create conversation.'
