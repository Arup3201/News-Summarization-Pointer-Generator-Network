This is the terrifying moment conservationists were attacked by a group of furious falcons as they tried to tag their young.

In a scene that could have come straight from the famous Hitchcock film The Birds, university researchers are forced to defend themselves with wooden shields as the birds swoop down at them, talons bared.

The hairy moment was caught on head cameras worn by the team, as they tried to track the young birds at Toledo University, Ohio.

Experts at the university removed the chicks from the nests, on the university's premises, for approximately 45 minutes, in a bid to take blood samples, checking for the presence of toxic chemicals, weigh each one, and clamp them with an ID band.

But the angry parents were clearly furious that their nests were being targeted - and the staff from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources' Division of Wildlife were forced to turn out well prepared for attack.

Brave conservationists stand firm while being constantly attacked by the menacing birds - which have a wingspan of more than a metre.

And the parents' don't give up on their vicious attack until the workers have finished and retreat - when they are gratefully reunited with their chicks.

A spokesperson for the university said: 'Last year the adult birds, Belle and Allen, successfully raised four chicks, two males, Shikoba and Blue Jacket, and two females, Unity and Aura, bringing their tally since 2007 to 20.

'All adult falcons will defend their nests and their chicks, although these birds are particularly good at it, despite the obstacles presented by the layout of the university bell tower, where the nest is located.

'After the hatchlings are banded, they're returned to the nest, none the worse for wear.

'The parents quiet down once the chicks are returned and things are back to normal within an hour.

'Birds have a poor sense of smell, so there is no danger of them rejecting their babies after they've been handled by humans.'
