The only thing cuter than a soaking wet puppy, is one caught in slow-motion.

The frenetic scenario would be familiar to any dog owner at bath time - but for a new photo book the speedy motion has been slowed down using a high-speed camera, to capture every skin-flapping second. 

Carli Davidson, from Portland, Oregon has photographed puppies from just four weeks to a year-old for a book called 'Shake Puppies'. It follows on from an earlier book on adult dogs called Shake.

Photographer Carli Davidson has already produced one book called, Shake, which involves slow-motion pictures of adult dogs

Getting the low dog: A puppy clings to the ground and shakes side to side, to try and dry off during the photo shoot

One hundred cute canines shook their way through their individual hour-long photo shoots and predictably the young pups caused chaos on set.

When they weren't attacking shoelaces, or reliving themselves on camera bags they were falling asleep under the warm lights.

Ms Davidson visited pet owners and rescue shelters to find her furry subjects and in the process even took one in.

Saul, an eight-year-old schnauzer, needed a new home when his previous owner developed dementia and Ms Davidson was happy to take him in: 'He's a puppy to me, I've only had him for a few months.'

The wet puppy project was hardly work at all for Ms Davidson: 'I was drawn to the idea of surrounding myself with puppies. It was almost medicinal-spending the day overdosing on cuteness.' 

Puppies galore: Ms Davidson said the hardest things about the project was resisting the temptation to adopt all the puppies from pet shelters

Do you mind? A puppy looks bemused by the photo shoot and appears to be asking for some privacy while it dries off 

Naughty: Ms Davidson said when the puppies weren't attacking shoelaces, or relieving themselves on camera bags they were falling asleep under the warm lights; nevertheless, she said they were easier to photograph than adult dogs

Baby baths: The puppies involved in the project were aged from just four weeks to a year-old, so couldn't be cuter

Despite the occasional bout of naughtiness, Ms Davidson said the puppies were 'easier' to photograph than adult dogs, saying: 'I think they were just more sensitive to moisture and being tussled.'

The main challenge, Ms Davidson explained, was resisting adopting all the puppies she came across when recruiting dogs at pet shelters.  

She said: 'I had to resist becoming a puppy hoarder myself, and it was difficult to watch owners struggle with their new puppies behaviors. Watching two species struggle to communicate with each other is hard, and when one of them is a baby it is even harder.'
