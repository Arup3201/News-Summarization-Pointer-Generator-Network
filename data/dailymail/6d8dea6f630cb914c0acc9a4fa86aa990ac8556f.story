A boy of ten raped a classmate in the toilets of his primary school as he ‘acted out’ scenes from online pornography, a court was told.

The jury heard that he approached a fellow pupil during an English lesson and asked if he wanted to have sex with him. Thinking he was joking, the other boy replied: ‘No way.’

But after the lesson the alleged victim went to the toilets and, as he went to leave, the defendant was said to have walked in and grabbed him.

Allegations: A 10-year-old boy has been accused of raping a classmate, also aged 10, in the toilets of a school in Colwyn Bay. The boy has pleaded not guilty to two charges. The trial is being held at Mold Crown Court

The court heard the boy then pushed him over a sink and raped him.

The victim, also 10, told him to stop and after about 10 seconds the alleged attacker pulled away, and apparently said: ‘Oh come on, the party’s just starting.’

Yesterday Mold Crown Court in North Wales was told the schoolboy had carried out the rape after watching pornography online. Karl Scholz, prosecuting, said: ‘It is almost certain that in this case what was being done was to act out what had been seen in pornographic material.’

He said the jury may conclude that what lay behind the alleged incident was the availability of pornography on the internet. ‘It is that which may lie behind the corruption of the minds of the people involved in this case,’ said Mr Scholz.

The accused boy, who is now 12, faces a charge of rape and a second charge of inciting his classmate to engage in sexual activity.

The alleged rape happened at a primary school in Colwyn Bay. The boy was so embarrassed that he might be branded homosexual he did not tell anyone until he was interviewed by teachers over a separate incident.

The boy also claimed that on another occasion the defendant and another boy pretended to be gay in the toilets, kissing each other. Each was said to have exposed himself and the complainant was told to carry out a sex act on the one he preferred.

He alleged that he was grabbed by the second boy and his head was pushed down before he broke free and ran off. The other boy was not before the court.

Campaign: The Mail is pressing for tighter controls on internet porn, which is viewed by many under-18s

Mr Scholz claimed that in a further incident the defendant tried to pull the boy’s trousers down as he washed his hands after using the toilet and when the boy would not let him the defendant allegedly asked him: ‘Why not? It’s fun.’

The court heard that in March last year the alleged victim was spoken to by teachers following rumours in the school that he had touched his girlfriend intimately.

The boy claimed he made up the story to impress his friends, but it was while teachers were speaking to him about the issue that he accused the defendant of rape.

That night he told his parents and the matter was reported to the police. The alleged victim told officers that the defendant was a bully in the playground.

Mr Scholz said the complainant would not go into the playground during break times to avoid being picked on.

The accused boy admitted to police that he had been mean to his classmate on occasions but said he had not bullied him. He told police he had never asked him for sex and nothing of sexual nature had ever happened between them.

The defendant said he had asked the alleged victim once for a date but said it was a joke and later told him he had ‘dumped him’.

The case continues.

The Mail is campaigning for tighter controls on internet pornography. We reported on Monday that a new system is to be introduced in which users of UK-based porn websites will have to prove they are over 18.
