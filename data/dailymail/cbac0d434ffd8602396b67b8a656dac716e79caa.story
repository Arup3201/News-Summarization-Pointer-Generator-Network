The Berlin Wall came down almost 25 years ago. But in one leafy corner of Middle England, the Iron Curtain lives on.

A 300ft-long fence, thrown up by millionaire farmer Alan Brunt to keep dog-walkers off his land, has led to a bitter showdown with locals who treasured their strolls across the wild meadow.

Yesterday they gathered to make their first public protest at what they say is now a grim, metal corridor reminiscent of a Gulag prison boundary.

The six foot high fence that has been erected along a field in Frome, Somerset. The fields known locally as the Rodden Lake Stream Meadow have been used by families

Opponents are demanding that Mr Brunt – who bought the field at Frome, Somerset, eight months ago – rethinks the height and appearance of his 6ft-high spiked fence.

He says he is merely trying to protect and contain his stock, prevent dog fouling and keep scooter-riding youths from using it as a racetrack.

However, it appears the former haulier and beef farmer woefully underestimated the thwarted fury of Middle England’s ramblers when he erected the fence over the Easter Bank holiday.

Last autumn the meadow was bought at auction by local businessman Alan Brunt for £210,000

Wind turbines and solar panels are one thing. But obstructing the views of a muddy track said to have been used for three generations amounts to a declaration of war.

As Scotland’s William Wallace almost said, they can take our lives but they will never take our footpaths.

Ruth Knagg, who heads the opposition, has battled for months to persuade the 64-year-old farmer to lease the land – Rodden Lake Stream Meadows – back to the community.

She and a host of fellow residents had previously raised £100,000 to buy it at auction, only to be blown away by Mr Brunt’s bid of £230,000.

The 48-year-old charity fundraiser said: ‘People have been walking across these fields for 50 years. The local primary school used to come here on field trips, but no more.

‘I really don’t understand why he’s done this. He says he wants to grow hay and graze his beef cattle but why make it look like a Gulag? 

‘If he really wants to keep dogs off, what’s wrong with a good old-fashioned barbed wire fence?’

Mr Brunt, who recently sold his haulage business, bought the 29-acre plot last September after the previous owner – who had happily allowed open access  – died.

Mrs Knagg – who has walked here for 20 years – added: ‘We were all pleased when Mr Brunt bought the land because he was bidding against a property developer.

‘But, of course, now we all fear that he will one day develop this land. Why else spend a quarter of a million pounds on it? 

‘The tragedy is that this was one of the last great, green spaces in the town – these fields were the green lungs of Frome and now they’re lost to us for ever. Mr Brunt won’t even talk to us any more and we are powerless – it’s so frustrating.

‘Mr Brunt told me he bought the land as a means of keeping his money safe after he sold his  haulage business.

‘We fear he may plan to develop the land at some point but, to be honest, it’s not that well suited to building houses on.

‘There are power lines overhead and the train track runs alongside. But it’s a lovely place, full of wild flowers, that we all hold dear.’

Dozens of locals yesterday braved torrential rain to picket the fence, including Dave and Briony Clark, their eight-year-old son Ted, and two-year-old labradoodle Ramsey.

The couple have walked here every week for 13 years. Plumber Mr Clark, 53, said: ‘In the old days we’d probably have turned up with pitchforks – now our worst weapon is a dog whistle.

Anger has erupted over metal fencing in Frome, Somerset installed across wildlife meadows that were at the centre of a public campaign last year to save them

‘But if this chap didn’t think he was doing something wrong,  why put the fence up almost overnight, in secret? And this thing is just hideous.

‘No one in their right mind would think that open fields are the place for threatening metal spikes that belong in a military prison.

‘He has ruined this lovely place. And for what? A few bundles of hay and a dozen cows.’

Architect Terry Pinto, 48, added: ‘This is a beautiful landscape and the most alien thing you can imagine has utterly ruined it.’

Wine merchant Jason Yapp, 46, has also been walking here for 13 years. He said: ‘It’s a disgrace. The fence is an eyesore, a scar on the landscape that has no business here.

‘As well as putting up the fence, Mr Brunt has demolished a beautiful hedgerow.

‘The community is up in arms. We all need to protect our green, open spaces. There is absolutely no need for a high-security-style fence in open countryside. What next, razor wire? My children have played here happily all their lives. This man has destroyed a thing of beauty.’

Town clerk Paul Wynne, 50, said: ‘I went to see Mr Brunt when he first bought the fields to see if we could reach some arrangement.

‘We had managed to raise £100,000 so we thought we might be able at least to buy half of the land but he turned us down flat. I don’t know why he wants so much land – 29 acres is a huge area to graze cattle on and there’s no money in hay.’

Mr Brunt bought the land after Mendip District Council rejected a bid to protect the area by Mrs Knagg’s action group Save Open Spaces. The group attempted to register the open pasture as a community asset, which also failed.

The group then asked Mr Brunt to keep the walkway clear but his response was to erect the fence, insisting walkers stick to the designated path.

Mr Brunt claims he built the fence to protect his livestock from the risk of disease posed by dog faeces – and to protect dogs and walkers from his cattle.

He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I chose the design for health and safety reasons. If I’d used wood or wire, people would have just cut it or knocked it down. Then I would have animals wandering on to the road and railway line. The truth is that walkers have been trespassing on that land for years. If they had cared for it properly I might not have needed a fence like this.

‘But they allow their dogs to mess everywhere and me and my staff have to work in it.

‘I thought, “They don’t look after it, so I will.” I went to the footpath people and asked if I could put a fence up and they said it was my right, so I did.

‘We’ve also had people camping rough on there and taking on mopeds and scooters late at night. It has been horrendous for the local residents but we have now sorted the problem out.’

And one resident last night welcomed the fence.

Jean Dredge, 80, whose garden abuts the entrance to the path, said Mr Brunt was a ‘saviour’ who had restored peace to the area.

She said: ‘It’s been lovely to walk out of my door these past few weeks and not be confronted by piles of dog mess.

‘Neither are we woken up at 6am by people slamming their car  doors and shouting good morning to each other.’
