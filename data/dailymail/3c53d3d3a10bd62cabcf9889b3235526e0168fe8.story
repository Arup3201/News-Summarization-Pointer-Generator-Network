Amazon has caused outrage by defending the use of the c-word by a retailer on its website as 'light-heated' and inoffensive.

The internet retail giant argued the word - widely regarded as the most offensive of all swearwords -  was not likely to offend any particular group, such as women.

The Advertising Standards Authority banned the internet advert for a Christmas card which featured the text: 'You're a c***. Sorry, I meant to say "Merry Christmas".'

The ASA said it was banning the ad under harm and offence rules in the advertising code, and on the grounds that it was likely to cause serious or widespread offence.

Defending its use, Amazon wrote to the ASA claiming it should not have been banned because 'the card was not offensive, aggressive or lewd in its message. It was meant as a bit of light-hearted, irreverent fun', the Guardian reports.

It added that the card did not target any particular group, and was not likely to cause offence to any particular race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or age.

The company behind the card, Smellyourmum.com, used a BBC  documentary 
devoted to the word and its derivation as part of its defence.

It argued that as The History of the C-Word, broadcast on BBC3 in 2007, used the word 
repeatedly and reached a larger audience than its adverts, it was acceptable for the company to use it in its 
advertising.

It also said it had added 'Merry Christmas' as a 'positive qualifier'.

Nicola Mendelsohn, chairman of advertising agency Karmarama, told the Guardian she was stunned at Amazon's attitude, as it is one of the most 'vulgar, dreadful words.'

In its submission to the ASA Amazon said that just because a 'small minority' find the word offensive the product should not be banned from being made available for sale the public.

It also asked whether the ASA should be ruling on the card at all, as it was a product not an advert.

The ASA said that the product listing was an advertisement and therefore it was 'entirely appropriate' for it to be investigating the complaint.
