A five-year-old boy has been hailed a hero after coming to his mother's aid when she collapsed with a serious heart condition in their home in Charlestown, Northern NSW, in November.

When brave Myles found his mum, Mel Wellham, unconscious on the kitchen floor, he knew exactly what to do because he had been practicing on The Triple Zero Kids Challenge mobile phone app.

His mother had been diagnosed with Vasovagal Syncope in May last year after spending four days in intensive care. The condition means she can pass out with very little warning, so she decided to prepare Myles in case another episode occurred when she was alone with her son.

Myles Wellham has been hailed a hero for calling Triple-0 when his mother collapsed in November

‘He said he was really scared but we pre-warned him because he knew how sick I was,’ Ms Wellham told the MailOnline said. ‘We said to him "if something happens you just call because mummy’s heart will always kick back in, it’s just something that happens and mummy just needs help”.’

It clearly paid off in November with the 11-minute recording of the emergency call proving how calm and brave the little boy was despite admitting later he felt scared that his mother was unconscious on the kitchen floor.

Ms Wellham was playing Lego with Myles on his bedroom floor when she started to feel unwell.

‘I gave him my phone while I went to the kitchen to get a drink,' she said. ‘I said to him “if anything happens you know what to do”.’

‘He told me he came looking for me when I didn’t come back,’ she said. ‘He said he knew I was unconscious because of the game he plays on my phone.’

Myles knew to call the number which was saved in his mother’s phone with a picture of an ambulance on it.

‘My mum won't wake up,’ he can be heard telling Triple-0 operator Jason Brown in a recording from the day.

The courageous boy stayed on the phone talking to Mr Brown for the entire 11 minutes until the paramedics arrived at the home.

Only in kindergarten at school, Myles was able to tell Mr Brown that his mother was 40-years-old and that she was still regularly breathing by obligingly saying ‘now’ every time she took a breath.

He followed every instruction given by Mr Brown including shaking her shoulder and tilting her head to check for any foreign objects.

In a very sweet moment, when asked his mother’s name, Myle’s innocently replied with ‘Mummy’.

Myles was presented with a NSW Ambulance Star Award, which recognises bravery shown by children facing difficult medical situations on Tuesday.

Paramedic Ken Smith was at the Hillsborough Public School ceremony to hand the award over to Myles in front of his classmates.

His mother is beaming with proud about Myles' heroic efforts.

‘He was amazing – he did a great job – it makes me very emotional,’ she said. ‘I really hope more kids can take a little leaf out of his book and play with the app and learn.’

‘By calling Triple 0 people can work out where you are even with a little bit of information– miles didn’t even know our phone number and stumbled a bit on the address but he got it.’

Mel Wellham said Myles was quite overwhelmed with the attention he received at the award ceremony at Hillsborough Public School on Tuesday
