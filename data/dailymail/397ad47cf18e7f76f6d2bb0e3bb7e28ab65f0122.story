Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney hit the campaign trail hard this week for GOP hopefuls across the country, laying hefty criticism on the current occupant of the White House wherever he went.

President Barack Obama 'went around the world and apologized for America. Now it's time for him to apologize to America,' Romney said of the man who dashed his presidential dreams while speaking at a rally in Livonia, Michigan, for Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land on Thursday.

'It's just tragic the mistakes that have been made,' the Republican heavyweight told the same audience, according to a reporter for The Detroit News.

But don't take Romney's prolific campaigning against President Obama and his Democratic allies as a sign that the two-time presidential contender is applying to be the nation's Commander in Chief a third time. As Romney repeatedly told reporters this week, it's not going to happen.

'I'm not running, I'm not planning on running and I expect to be supporting one of the many people who I think are looking at this race,' the former Massachusetts governor said Thursday.

'We have a number of different voices within our party that have have different views about where america should go and I look forward to supporting one of them,' he added, according to The Courier-Journal.

'I don't know which one it will be.'

Romney was in Louisville, Kentucky, campaigning for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell when he attempted to make his presidential aspirations, or lack thereof, crystal clear. 

There, he also decried almost every major foreign policy decision Obama has made as president, accusing him of 'misjudging Russia's intentions and ambitions, misunderstanding what would happen if we did not support moderate voices in Syria and get them armed, misunderstanding what would happen if Iraq didn't have a status of forces agreement with American troops staying behind to help support the Iraqi military.'

In Michigan, the place of Romney's birth and the state his father George Romney served as governor, the former presidential nominee pleaded with his audience to elect Land to the Senate in November in order to place a check on President Obama.

The Senate is controlled by Democrats as present, but Republicans have a strong chance of swinging the pendulum their way in the upcoming midterm elections. 

'I need your help. Michigan definitely can be the difference between new leadership in the Senate, or more of [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid,' Romney said in remarked captured by CBS's Washington, D.C. affiliate.

Romney spent his week doing his part to help Republicans take a majority in the upper chamber, traveling to seven battleground states in the span of five days.

The amped up campaign schedule gave reporters and candidates alike multiple opportunities to press him on his plans in 2016.

At an appearance on Wednesday in Atlanta, Georgia, with Republican attorney general candidate Sam Olen, Romney reiterated that he's just trying to 'help people who are running for something' and isn't out on the trail this fall to further his own political ambitions.

'I was honored to become the Republican nominee, so I continue to have some voice. But I'm not running for anything,' he told reporters, according to CBS. 'And I'm making my effort known in the states that welcome me.'

CBS noted that Olen told Romney, 'I wish you were on 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.'

'I'm just sad I'm not able to be there either,' Romney replied, after a reporter prodded him about giving it another shot. 

'I'd like to be in the White House. I wish I would have had the chance,' Romney lamented.

Romney has said for months that he doesn't intend to seek his party's nomination to the presidency for a third time, but ambiguous statements about how 'circumstances can change' and comments from wife, Ann, about what it would take for Mitt to enter the race next year have left fans of the Republican politician hoping he'll give it another go after all.

The New York Times may have doused even more cold water on Romney's alleged 2016 plans this week when it reported that Mitt and Ann were permanently relocating to Utah be closer to their son Josh, who owns property adjacent to the land they've been building a 5,900 square foot home on for the last year and a half or so.

They also bought an $8.9 million home in the state last year and have been living in it part time ever since.

Romney's last two presidential campaigns were run out of Massachusetts, where he currently resides, by longtime aides - many of whom worked for him since his time as governor. A move to Utah would make little sense for the Romneys from an operational standpoint if Mitt secretly hopes to run again.
