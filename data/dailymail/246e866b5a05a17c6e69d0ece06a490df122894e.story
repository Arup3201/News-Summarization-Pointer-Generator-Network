It is one of the most natural things in the world to do, but for centuries women have been criticised and prevented from breastfeeding their child in public. 

Even in the 21st Century, western mothers are stopped from providing milk to their baby in everyday places like coffee shops, leisure centres and department stores.

But a new poll undertaken this week shows that 80 per cent of people now think it is ok for a woman to bare the boob in a restaurant or bar in order to feed a hungry baby and 67 per cent of people polled believe that a woman should be able to breastfeed anywhere in public.

Many mums still feel uncomfortable about breast feeding in public (as posed by model), although now 80 per cent of people in a new survey believe it is an acceptable practice in restaurants and bars. 

20 per cent of people still felt that anywhere that people eat or drink is an unacceptable place for a woman to breastfeed. 

Figures for mums undertaking the practice on public transport are better, with only 18 per cent of people claiming that they would be offended to see a woman openly breastfeeding on trains, buses or aeroplanes. 

The positive results come off the back of a surge in young female celebrities posting snaps of themselves breastfeeding their children on social networking sites like Instagram. 

Most recently, the actress Olivia Wilde posed while breastfeeding her newborn in a photo-shoot for Glamour magazine. 

She told the publication: 'Being shot with Otis is so perfect because any portrait of me right now isn't complete without my identity as a mother being part of that, breastfeeding is the most natural thing.

'I don't know, now it feels like Otis should always be on my breast.' 

Celebrity mums including Gisele Bundchen, Miranda Kerr and Gwen Stefani has also got in on the act, posted pictures of themselves breastfeeding to social networking sites. 

 Rosemary Dodds, Senior Policy Adviser for the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) said of the survey: 'The figures are positive overall but there is still work to do to bring the minority of people into the 21st century. 

'It’s important that not only families but businesses know it is illegal to discriminate against a woman because she is breastfeeding – a law that sits under the Equality Act 2010. 

'Whether formula feeding or breastfeeding, mothers needs to be able to feed their baby whenever and wherever they need it.' 

But while the large majority of the population believe that it is ok for a mum to breastfeed in public, there is still a minority who hold strong opinions about the practice not happening in several specific places. 

Gisele Bundchen posted a snap of herself feeding her daughter while having her hair, nails and make-up done to her Twitter page 

17 per cent of people still struggle to see breastfeeding in leisure centres or swimming pools areas though, which would still force women into damp changing rooms to nourish their baby. 

In the poll commissioned by myvouchercodes.co.uk, taking part in retail therapy would also be difficult for some mums, with 17 per cent of people believing it is inappropriate to breastfeed in shops. 

And 15.5 per cent of people wouldn't tolerate a glimpse of a woman's chest in a town or city centre altogether.

The last statistic echoes the experience of Emily Slough, 27, when a passer-by took a picture of her breastfeeding her child while sitting on a step in Rugeley, Staffordshire, and posted it on Facebook with the caption: 'I know the sun is out n all that but there's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town!!! Tramp'. 

The snap caused outrage among women's rights campaigners and mothers' groups, with several protest sit-ins taking place as a result. 

Emily later appeared on ITV's Daybreak to speak out:

'I was showing a lot less flesh than a lot of people do - I wasn't sitting there with my breast out.

'Breastfeeding mums aren't doing it to antagonise people or gain attention - they are doing it to meet their babies' needs. 

'Why should mothers who are doing the best by their children feel that they should be confined to a toilet or changing room to provide their baby with nutrients?

'Would you eat in a toilet or with a blanket draped over your face?' 

Over the past ten years, UK surveys of breastfeeding mums have shown less and less are having negative experiences while feeding their child in public spaces. 

In 2006, The National Public Breastfeeding Survey reported that more than one fifth of mothers had either been told to stop breastfeeding or were made to feel uncomfortable by something somebody said whilst they breastfed in public. 

In 2010, the Infant Feeding Survey reported that just over one in ten mums  said that they had been stopped in public or been made to feel uncomfortable doing so.
