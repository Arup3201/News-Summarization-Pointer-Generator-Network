Manuel Pellegrini has revealed the interests of Manchester City will come first when a decision is made about Frank Lampard's future.

City's sister club New York City FC want Lampard to join them as planned in January for the new MLS season, no matter how well he plays while on loan in the Barclays Premier League club in the meantime.

But City boss Pellegrini today underlined that the decision that is made will be motivated by his team's needs.

Frank Lampard is currently on loan at Manchester City from American franchise New York City FC

Pellegrini described Lampard, who scored twice against Sheffield Wednesday, as a very important City player

The midfielder's parent side New York City FC have insisted his loan stay at the Etihad will finish in the New Year but Pellegrini says the Manchester club will do what is in their best interests when that time comes

He said: 'I can clarify the situation. Lampard is playing and scored two goals in the last game. In this moment he's a very important player for us.

'He will stay with us here on loan is until January and we will see what happens in the future and it's not a problem we have to analyse in this moment.

'We will see after when the loan has finished what we are going to do.

'The possibility is to do the best for Manchester City. 

'Frank is a very important player for England and the Premier League. All of you want to continue to see Frank Lampard here.'

The Argentine brushed off the criticism of Arsene Wenger, who suggested Lampard's short-term deal with City was questionable on moral grounds. 'I don't analyse what other managers say,' said the City boss.

Pellegrini confirmed Sergio Aguero and David Silva could feature against Hull on Saturday, but Fernando and Stevan Jovetic will miss the game through injury.  

'We continue with Jovetic and Fernando out of the team,' said the 61-year-old. 'They will be ready next week and Samir Nasri also has a groin problem. 

'Sergio [Aguero] and David [Silva] are both okay.'

The Argentine boss was happy with the manner of City's 7-0 drubbing of Sheffield Wednesday on Wednesday

On their comprehensive 7-0 win against Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup, he said: 'I think it was very useful match for our team. We weren't scoring too many goals at home. 

'In the last four we didn't win, we are not playing bad but we didn't win. Important to win the way we did on Wednesday and we hope that can continue at Hull because in the PL we can't drop many points. 

'I don't know the reason [why more goals are being conceded by clubs in the Premier League]. The same statistic about our team is not so good because we scored more in the first five games last season.

'We didn't score against our rivals like Chelsea last year, and we did score this year, and similar against Stoke and Newcastle. In the whole of the Premier League I really don't know.'

Spanish starlet Jose Pozo scored in City's emphatic 7-0 Capital One Cup win against Sheffield Wednesday

Young midfielder Jose Pozo, who was on the scoresheet midweek, is one of a crop of youngsters that Pellegrini has high hopes for this campaign. 

'It's important when you have the opportunity to give a chance to the young player to see that you're not wrong,' said Pellegrini. 'Pozo is a very good player.

'Now he's coming back after a year out with his ankle. I'm happy to give him the opportunity and I'm happy because I see him work every day.'

On this weekend's opponents, he said: 'I think that Hull is a difficult team playing away. Last year was maybe not our best game because Vincent Kompany was sent off in the first 10 minutes. 

'We played really well and we won. I hope that his year we can do it in the same way but we will find it very tough at their home because they always play very strong.' 

Pellegrini said he sees James Milner as a valuable squad member at the Etihad, despite the England international struggling for playing time this season. 

'I think that what James Milner said is what every player would say,' he explained.

'They all want to play more games. James is an important player for our squad, he knows what I think about that. He's always involved, some starting from the beginning or as a substitute but he's always playing.'

'I don't agree that money is the important thing,' said Pellegrini, when addressing the balance of power in the Premier League. 

'Every team that wants to have chances to win the Premier League must spend money on good players. We didn't spend more money than Chelsea, United or Arsenal in the last 10 years. Every team has important players and has spent money but you don't win just with money.'

On the number of changes he made against City, which saw Joe Hart and Vincent Kompany drop out of the starting line-up, he replied: 'We had a squad and the whole squad will try to be a competitive team in the four competiions. That's why we tried to make some rotations but not with some special names. Kompany was rested.'

Pellegrini refused to confirm who would start in goal after Willy Caballero played against Sheffield Wednesday. 'We will see tomorrow who is starting,' he replied.
