A sex attacker who groped a young woman in the street at 4am has been jailed after she filmed him on her iPhone.

Luis Silva, 22, had fought with his girlfriend and 'drunk enough to sink a ship' when he exposed himself to the stranger, groped her and slapped her to the ground.

When she revealed she was filming him, Silva tried to take her phone by force - but she ran away and handed the footage to police, who issued the images to the public.

Silva was jailed yesterday for three-and-a-half years  after he admitted sexual assault, attempted robbery and indecent exposure.

Judge Robert Juckes QC said: 'The victim showed an extraordinary presence of mind and intelligence by recording the attack.'

The court heard Silva, of Repton, Derbyshire, had spent £150 on whisky after a row with his girlfriend.

He then went outside and wandered the streets of Evesham, Worcestershire, where he worked, until he found the victim.

Prosecutor Paul Whitfield told Worcester Crown Court: 'The defendant began to follow the woman through the town.

'He approached her at a junction and exposed himself.

'He then demanded she touched him and, when she got out her mobile phone to film him, he sexually assaulted her by touching her over her clothes.'

West Mercia Police used stills from the footage to appeal for witnesses and Silva was quickly recognised.

Sarah Holland, defending, told the court Silva did not remember the incident but was 'very ashamed' of his actions.

He had moved to Britain from his native Portugal in January this year looking for a better life, she added.

He had moved to be close to his girlfriend and had a job in a fish and chip shop in Evesham.

Miss Holland said on the night of the attack Silva had an argument with his girlfriend and her mother, who was visiting from Portugal, and had gone out to 'drown his sorrows'.
