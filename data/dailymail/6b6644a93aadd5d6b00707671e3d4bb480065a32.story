These two might have been fighting, but nobody watching on wanted to intervene as it was the cutest thing they’d ever seen.

Two adorable bear cubs were seen having a brawl by tourists on a road at Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, California.

A video of the loveable cubs was uploaded to YouTube by ‘Jmolyneaux77’ and it has already proven a hit, with more than 30,000 views.

Little scrap: Two adorable bear cubs were seen having a brawl by tourists on a road at Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, California

'That is the cutest,' one woman says, as the camera pans to show a bigger bear near the roadside watching what is happening.

‘They're like puppy size,’ another onlooker says. 'I want one,’ says one person watching the cubs, who were fighting in front of a parked car.

An onlooker says 'one of them is so small’, before joking: 'Oh please come to my car'. The cubs later go and follow an adult bear away from the road.

Yosemite National Park rangers often have problems with bears who pick up food from rubbish left out or unsecured bins.

There have been more than 20 incidents this year alone - and 12 bears have been hit by vehicles so far in the park in 2011.

Yosemite covers nearly 1,200 sq miles
- featuring waterfalls, deep valleys, meadows, ancient giant sequoias 
and a vast wilderness.
