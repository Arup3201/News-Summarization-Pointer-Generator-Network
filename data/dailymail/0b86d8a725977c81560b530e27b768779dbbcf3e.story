Former Wales and British Lions flanker Martyn Williams has called on the RBS 6 Nations organisers to change the way they draw up the Player of the Championship shortlist after Sam Warburton was left out of 12-man nominations.

Warburton, 26, was one of his country's best players throughout the competition but the Wales skipper is not up for the top gong, which is based upon performance statistics rather than balanced expert opinions.

Dan Biggar and Alun-Wyn Jones are the only Welsh nominations while Scotland, who lost every game, also have two players in the running in Jonny Gray and Stuart Hogg.

'Sam is the standout name not on that list,' Williams told Sportsmail. 'It was a big surprise. It's always very contentious, but it's picked using statistics and I don't think that's the way to do it. I prefer the way they do it for World Player of the Year where they use a panel of experts to get a general consensus. Sam can feel very hard done by for not making it. You could make a case for Leigh Halfpenny and Liam Williams as well.

'Sam's stats are always very high but penalties can count against you if you play on the edge. His influence on the team can't be measured through stats because they don't capture those big moments in a game where the big players stand up. 

'Sam will be the player to win a big turnover to win a big game; but that just counts as one turnover on a stat sheet. He's a fantastic role model and a leader by actions.'

After losing their opening Test against England, Wales went on to win all of their remaining fixtures and eventually finished third on points difference. Warren Gatland expects his side to be serious challengers at the World Cup and, if they can continue to build on their momentum, Williams believes they have the talent to make the final at Twickenham.

'This squad has more or less been together for four years, so they're in a really good place,' said Williams. 

'They will obviously be disappointed not to win the tournament but, in terms of the bigger picture, they're looking good for the World Cup. Can they be challengers? Yes, why not? The group stages are just as difficult as the quarter and semi finals. That's how finely balanced it is. If they win the group, then they could go all the way. Then again, they might not get out of their group at all.'
