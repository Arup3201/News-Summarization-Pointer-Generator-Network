A 21-year-old Missouri father has been charged with felony child abuse after his baby son died from a traumatic brain injury last month.

Cody Bunch of Festus told police three-month-old  Aiden was injured when he fell over while carrying him.

Aiden was hurt on January 6 and the infant died at St. Louis Children's Hospital after he was taken off life support four days later.

After doctor's discovered evidence of seven prior injuries, Bunch was charged on January 16 with 'child abuse resulting in death' and he is being held in the Jefferson County Jail on a $500,000, cash-only bond. 

If found guilty of the Class A felony, which is equivalent to a manslaughter or murder charge, Bunch faces a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum of life behind bars.

The infant was born on October 6. His memorial service was held on January 14 in Missouri 

Police arrived at the family's apartment around 2.15 am after Aiden’s mother, Brooke Besch, called 911 and reported the boy was not breathing.

When they arrived, Bunch told them he had fallen down while he was holding the boy, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. 

An autopsy revealed the boy had seven contusions inside his scalp, swollen neck ligaments and a subdural hematoma. 

A doctor found the injuries were caused by 'abusive head trauma' and not from a fall. 

Lieutenant Sgt. Jim Kausler of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department said: 'Through the course of the investigation we determined that there was some head trauma. 

'We questioned the last people to have custody, the mother and father.

'There was more than one injury that he [Bunch] wasn't telling us about.' 

Neighbors in Bunch's apartment complex said he was unemployed after recently losing his job, KTVI reported. 

A family member called the situation a 'nightmare'.

Bunch sent this message to a Missouri community page the day after his son's memorial service

In a Facebook post he sent to community page Jeffo 411 on January 15, the day after Aiden's memorial service, Bunch wrote: 'Hi, I'm Cody. I recently just had my 3 month old son pass away.

'Therefor [sic], I have ALOT of stuff that is going to be donated for people in need, and would like to help someone. 

'The smaller stuff we are just giving away, and some of the bigger stuff we will sell for a reasonable price. 

'If anyone is interested please let me know. Have a good night, and day.'
