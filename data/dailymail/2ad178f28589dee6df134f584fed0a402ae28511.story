An Oklahoma City Thunder cheerleader has spoken out with some choice words aimed at the female blogger who criticized her figure and then posted a poll asking whether she was 'too chunky' to cheer.

'Shame on you. I mean you are a woman … you know exactly what we all go through on a daily basis just being a woman,' Kelsey Williams said. 'Shame on you.'

Under the pen name 'Claire Crawford,' blogger Anna-Megan Raley wrote: '[Mrs Williams] has been criticized by some folks in [Oklahoma] for having 'pudginess' around her waistline... Is this chick 'too chunky' to be a cheerleader?'

Ms Raley's post was ultimately taken down from the website, but the damage had been done.

Mrs WIlliams, who has cheered for three-years on the squad, was pictured in the article 'at a bad angle' wrote some commentators.

Speaking to ABC News this morning Williams said her 'heart sank' when she read what the CBS Houston sports blogger writing under the name 'Claire Crawford' had written after seeing her cheer at a first-round NBA playoffs game between the Thunder and the Houston Rockets.

'The Rockets looked terrible in Game 1, but some say they weren’t the only bad-looking people on the court,' Crawford wrote on Houston’s SportsRadio 610 website.

In her blog, Crawford admitted that Kelsey Williams was a 'pretty blonde' but her blog drew criticism.

She also posted a poll asking readers to decide if 'this chick is too chunky to cheer'.

Three choices were offered: 'She has the perfect look to be an NBA cheerleader,' or 'She could use some tightening up in her midsection,' and finally, 'She has no business wearing that outfit in front of people.'

Speaking to Good Morning America, Williams said that she eats works out between three and four hours each day as well as eating correctly. She told viewers that she is a size 4.

'I have always had more of an athletic build, different than the slender ballerina that some people may think of as a dancer, and that’s just not me,' she said.

Williams said she is grateful for the positive comments she has received from her family, friends and fans online.

The cheerleader said the past few weeks had been difficult for her family, particularly her husband and dad.

'I have so much love in me,' she said. 'Sending hate her way would do nothing … what’s done is done. I’m just going to keep my chin up.'
