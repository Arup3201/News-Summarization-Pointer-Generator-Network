Climate change has been blamed for many things - from melting ice caps to extreme storms - but it’s now threatening a British staple.

The Tocklai tea station has been recording daily weather and tea production data for more than a century and has found a rise in temperature, coupled with erratic rainfall, is damaging tea leaves globally.

For example, ambient temperatures in Assam, India have risen from 35°C to upwards of 50°C and after 48°C, tea leaves stop breathing and are destroyed.

India produces a third of the world's tea and the Assam region, including the tea fields near Kaziranga National Park, pictured, produces more than half of it. According to the Tea Research Association, global temperatures are inching upwards globally, due to climate change, and all the tea-producing belts are affected

Lack of rainwater and droughts affect how much tea is produced, while floods destroy anything that does grow. 

In Assam, in particular, the ambient temperature has increased from 35°C to upwards of 50°C out of the shade.

Between
 35°C and 39°C photosynthesis slows down, and when temperatures reach 
48°C, the tea leaves stop breathing and are destroyed.

In
 addition, the use of pesticide is regulated in tea regions 
meaning when pests do infest the estates, they’re damage is more 
significant.

India produces a third of the world’s tea and the Assam region produces more than half of it.

Kenya, Sri Lanka and China are also major exporters of tea and the regions sit on what’s known as the tea-belt.

According to the Tea Research Association, global temperatures are inching upwards globally, and all the tea-producing belts are affected.

The Tocklai tea station, in particular, found the minimum temperature across the belts has risen by 1.5°C, while the annual rainfall has dropped by 200mm.

This not only affects the amount of tea that is produced, but also increases how much production costs.

Although the overall annual rainfall has dropped, the region is also subject to erratic storms, followed by droughts.

Manish Bargaria, who owns a tea estate in northern Assam told the BBC: ‘What we have been noticing over the decade is we get a lot of rainfall in one particular month or a couple of months and that erodes the topsoil of the tea garden.

‘While that already affects our production, the dry spell makes our bushes prone to pests, for which we have to use more pesticides and that means higher costs.’

In Assam, in particular, the ambient temperature has increased to upwards of 50°C in the sunshine. 

Aside from the changing weather, other conditions needed to produce the tea are affected.

Between 35°C and 39°C, for example, photosynthesis slows down, and when temperatures reach 48°C, the tea leaves are ruined.

In addition, the use of pesticide is regulated in tea regions meaning when pests do infest the estates, they’re damage is more significant.

Due to this fluctuating weather, the quality of the tea leaves that do grow is also affected.

Biologists from Tufts University have embarked on a study that will examine how climate change affects the concentration of chemical compounds found in tea, including their health benefits.

'Since the quality of tea is determined by a range of secondary chemicals that depend on climatic conditions, climate change can have significant consequences for tea markets," said lead Colin researcher Orians.

'People buy and drink tea for certain qualities. If those qualities are not there, then they may not buy the tea.'

Orians said that the team hopes to be able to work out exactly how climate change is affecting tea production in order to develop ways of adapting to the changes.
