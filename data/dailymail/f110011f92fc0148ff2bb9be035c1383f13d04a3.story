The British author behind best-selling novel One Day has revealed how his latest book was delayed by a computer program which starts deleting words if they are not written quickly enough.

David Nicholls had so much trouble starting his latest book Us that he downloaded Write or Die - a software package that promises a 'consequence' if the user does not write a certain number of words within the set time frame.

But the 47-year-old told the Cheltenham Literature Festival how the program ended up compounding his writer's block by making him feel as though he were writing 'with a gun' to his head.

Author David Nicholls, 47, from north London, says his latest novel Us was delayed after he downloaded a computer program which deletes words if the writer does not type quickly enough

The father-of-two, who lives in north London, was eventually forced to scrap his first draft of 35,000 words and start his novel again, more than two years later.

It means the highly-anticipated book - Us - has now been five years in the making.

According to The Times, he told the audience: 'At the lowest point, I downloaded this piece of software called Write or Die. You set it going and start to type and if you stop, it starts to delete what you've written.

'I produced huge piles of paper and I saw it was all rubbish. It was as if I was writing with a gun to my head.'

He added: 'I wrote 35,00 words and every one was agony. In December 2012, I showed it to my agent and friend. We met in January 2013 and they said "I think you should put this to one side".' 

Nicholls also revealed how he used programs Freedom and SelfControl while writing the book, both of which he found to be more successful.

The programs - designed to stop procrastination - prevent users from accessing certain sites online and have been hailed by White Teeth author Zadie Smith and Nick Hornby.

Us is told from the viewpoint of scientist Douglas Peterson, who goes on an InterRailing trip across Europe with his wife Connie and teenage son Albie.

But before the trip, Connie unexpectedly tells Douglas that she wants to leave him. The holiday becomes the chance to salvage not just his marriage, but his relationship with his son, with whom he has become somewhat estranged.

The storyline was inspired by Nicholls’s own experience of being on the road while promoting One Day five years ago. 

The book follows the mismatched trio on their adventures in Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Venice, Florence, Sienna, Madrid and Barcelona.

Each destination on the trip triggers a memory of happier times - and all three members of the family must question whether they have a future together.

Experts believe the story will have widespread appeal and could be a break-out hit among older audiences.

Young love: One Day was adapted for the big screen in 2011, starring Jim Sturgess and Anne Hathaway and there is already a battle for exclusive film rights to Us 

Gladiator star Russell Crowe is among the Hollywood A-listers already locked in a battle for the film rights. He reportedly wants to produce and star in the possible adaptation. 

Nicholls confirmed last month to MailOnline that there was interest in a film version of his new novel.

‘Yes, there has been talk about that. Of course I would love it to have another life like One Day,' he said.

One Day was adapted into a film in 2011 starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess as lovers whose relationship was charted on the same date over several years.  

There are now dozens of apps, computer programs and free downloads sweeping the internet which are designed to encourage writers into being more productive.

Write or Die - which is marketed using the catchphrase 'Putting the "prod" in productivity' - was designed by 'Dr Wicked' to encourage writers to just keep on typing.

Each person who downloads the program can chose a time goal or a word-count for which to aim. If they stop writing before this goal is reached, the 'consequences' begin.

The program can be used in a 'forgiving', 'strict' or 'evil' setting, varying the 'consequences' which are dished out. The writer is also allowed to pause the session once, for example if they need a toilet break.

The program then uses a variety of punishments, including sounding off noises which the writer has admitted to hating, playing out songs the write might loathe or projecting images onto the screen which they might find frightening. 

The ultimate consequence sees words deleted. In the latest version, there are also 'rewards for accomplishment'.

British novelist Helen Oyeyemi, the author of four novels - including White is for Witching and Mr Fox - previously told how she successfully used the software for some of her work. She encouraged other writers to download it.

Meanwhile, another program used by authors is Freedom, developed by Fred Stutzman. Used by Nick Hornby, Dave Eggers and Naomi Klein, it blocks the user from being able to access the internet.

Mr Stutzman also created Anti-Social, a less severe version of the program which blocks any social-media sites.

SelfControl, created in 2009 by American artist Steve Lambert, also allows users to block whichever websites they chose for the time period they decide upon.
