It took just four minutes for Marouane Fellaini to serve a reminder of his worth.

Thrown on with an attacking remit during Belgium’s World Cup opener against Algeria, he rose inside the penalty area, twisting his awkward frame and using his bushy barnet to flick home the equalising goal in a 2-1 victory – it was classic Fellaini, a vintage not witnessed since his time at Everton.

After 10 months without a goal for club or country, perhaps this was the turning point in his faltering career.

One man, however, was not for turning. For Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal had already decided that Fellaini was not for him.

The 26-year-old is available for transfer at Old Trafford, chief executive Ed Woodward having been instructed by the new Dutch manager to offload last summer’s £27.5million signing.

It charts the sorry demise of a player 
once feared by Premier League defences. And therein lies the 
accelerating factor behind Fellaini’s failure.

For David Moyes – the man who took Fellaini with him to United and knew his merits more than anyone – never once deployed him as a second striker, the role in which he had excelled, inspired and intimidated for the Toffees.

Instead, he was used as a holding midfielder, a position which exposed his shortcomings as a ball player, completely negating the effectiveness of his size, athleticism and hunger for goals.

He was so poor in the Champions League quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich that one foreign newspaper refused to even rate his performance.

Yet Fellaini never protested, seemingly content to drift through the campaign. Even when criticism became concentrated on the Belgian, Moyes refused to reposition his flop. The Scot’s stubbornness was staggering.

Indeed, there was an interesting exchange between former United defender Rio Ferdinand – not thought to have been a fan of Moyes – and BBC presenter Gary Lineker during coverage of Belgium’s second-round victory over USA.

Ferdinand offered: ‘I think his (Fellaini) best position is off the frontman. At Everton we played against him numerous times. I saw him play against Chelsea, Man City, his best games in an Everton shirt were off the frontman.

‘He's difficult to play against. He gets that ball into him, he's awkward, he puts his arms everywhere, and that's where he's most effective for me.’

Lineker replied: ‘Hence why he didn't fit in at Manchester United because he never got the chance to play there?’

To which Ferdinand came back: ‘Well I think you play players in their best positions and I think his best games for Everton were up there, causing problems for centre halves.’

Fellaini has started each of Belgium’s three matches since his game-changing impact against Algeria.

Like Moyes, however, Marc Wilmots has used him in a midfield berth and again he has struggled to exert any influence.

But Van Gaal, it would appear, had determined Fellaini’s fate before the tournament began.

Fellaini made just 16 starts for United and five more from the bench, failing to score in any of those.

Moyes paid the price and was sacked. It is likely that Fellaini will follow him out of the door.
