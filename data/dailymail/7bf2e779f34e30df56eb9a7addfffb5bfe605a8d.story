Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Superman - or Supermen - pulled over in a customised super car while flying down the M42 near Solihull, West Midlands.

Officers from the Central Motorway Policing Group - made up of officers and staff from West Midlands, West Mercia and Staffordshire police forces - stopped the vehicle on suspicion of driving without insurance.

The car had no rear window, but a piece of red fabric tied across the top of the opening.

It gave the vehicle its own superhero touch - with the fabric fluttering like Superman's cape in the wind as the vehicle drove down the motorway.

And officers did a double-take when the driver and passenger stepped out, both dressed as the comic book superhero in blue costumes - with Superman's iconic 'S' logo printed on their chests.

After stopping the car on Saturday night, Central Motorway Police Group tweeted: 'Even Superman needs insurance. We don't work for Lex Luthor, but we had to remove Superman's wheels from the road.'

Images of the two not-so superheroes soon spread across the globe.

The Oklahoma County Sheriff tweeted his West Midlands counterparts: 'Nice work! Not even Superman has a chance against police Kryptonite. He's much better at flying than driving, anyway. Stay Safe.'

The comment brought a swift response from the British officers: 'Great to have our American colleagues following us. Stay safe out there. We will send Superman back over to you.'
