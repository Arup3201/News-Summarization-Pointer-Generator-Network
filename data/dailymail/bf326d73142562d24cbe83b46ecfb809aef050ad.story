A young student was charged nearly $800 for a two mile journey after she was ripped off by a driver and failed to check the charge on a mobile credit card app.

Becky Siegel, 20, was taking a short cab ride in downtown Chicago, a journey which would normally cost her under $10, after running late to meet her friends in December last year.

Miss Siegel, from Winniteka, asked to pay by credit card, to which the driver responded that his machine was not working and that he would use a mobile device if she handed over her card.

Shortly afterwards, her mother Susan Siegel was shocked to find a $787.33 transaction on her credit card statement and when she confronted her daughter, Becky concluded that she must have been overcharged for the cab ride.

‘At the end of the trip he gave her a price and she thinks it was under ten dollars, and so she asked can I use a credit card, and he said my swiper isn't working, here give it to me and I'll do it on my Square,’ Miss Siegel told FOX 32.

She said she was given a price of under $10 and that she told the driver to add another two dollars in trips, before she signed off on the Square transaction on by using her finger on the smartphone screen.

A Square is a small card reader which can be plugged into any smartphone through the headphone jack.

The reader converts the magnetic card track data into audio form and transmits it to the phone, after which the payment is carried out through an app.

Mrs Siegel was sent the receipt from the taxi journey which showed that the driver had charged her daughter $656.11 and that Becky 'tipped' $131.22

When her mother discovered the overcharge she immediately contacted the credit card company, Chase credit which uses Visa, however as Becky had signed for the transaction there was nothing they could do.

Fortunately Mrs Seigel was provided with a full receipt for the fare, which had the cab company and the driver’s name on it.

But when she contacted the driver, a man named Ali Ghazanfari, he claimed the fare was valid.

It was not until Mrs Seigel contacted  the local newspaper’s problem-solver column which in turn got in touch with both Mr Ghazanfari and Chicago’s Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection.

Once the department, which regulates taxicabs, suspended Mr Ghazanfari’s public chauffeur licence, things changed.

‘He called me two or three times, and he was in a panic. What I know now is that he is really sorry he got caught,’ Mrs Seigel said.

Mrs Seigel has since been promised a full refund from Square.
