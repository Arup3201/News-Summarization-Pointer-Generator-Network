This could be considered his latest 'Shaq attack.'

Retired NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, 42, has officially become  a reserve police officer for the Doral Police Department in South Florida.

The former Miami Heat player was sworn in at a special ceremony on Tuesday by Doral Police Chief Donald De Lucca.

The ceremony was attended by the Mayor of Doral Luigi Borra, the city attorney, city manager and City Council. 

But now that O' Neal has his badge, Doral Police Department is trying to figure out how they'll be able to make a uniform that's big enough to fit the star who is 7ft 1in tall and weighs 324-pounds.

'His shoe size is huge, but nobody knows the exact number,' senior executive assistant to the chief, Carlos Arango said chuckling. 

'At some point we'll get him an official polo shirt, but for now he has his badge.' 

O' Neal had originally applied to become a member of Doral police in September. He went through the entire application process and submitted to a background check before he was taken on.

But  he will not receive a salary and will cover his own insurance costs.

According to the police department, O'Neal will commute to work from his homes in Fort Lauderdale and Orlando.

De Lucca told The Miami Herald that Shaq will mostly be doing community work and serving as a role model for children.

'I want them to be be able to say: 'If Mr. O'Neal can do it, I can do it,' he told The Miami Herald. 

But it's not his first time the NBA legend has worked to protect and serve.

He has previously served as a reserve police officer for Miami Beach and Golden Beach in Florida; in Tempe, Arizona; and the Port of Los Angeles.  

O'Neal has said that he considers police work to be his 'calling' and revealed that two of his uncles were police officers and his stepfather was an Army sergeant. 

Despite a glittering basketball career, he admits that he has been interested in law enforcement since he was a teenager. 

During Shaq's two-decade basketball career, he played in Orlando, Los Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, Cleveland and Boston.

While in Miami, he traveled back and forth to Virginia, where he worked on the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program.

And he admits that his long-term goal is to become a police chief or sheriff in Florida.

He said: 'When it's all said and done, [I'd like to work in] either Orange County, Dade County or Broward. But, I have to work from the ground up first.'

O'Neal, however, heaped praise on Doral's current Chief, who has served as police chief of Miami Beach and of Golden Beach while Shaq was a reserve officer.

He said: 'He's a great leader. I'm learning from him, watching him. He's a good friend of mine, and in order to become a great leader, you have to master their style and then create your own style.' 

In return, De Lucca praised O' Neal saying: 'We're honored to have him as part of our team, he's a role model for today's youth; he believes in the nobility of our profession.'
