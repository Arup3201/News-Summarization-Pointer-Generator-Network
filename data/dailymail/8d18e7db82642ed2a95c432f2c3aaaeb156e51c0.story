Britain's millionaires are some of the youngest in the world with an average age of just 55, a survey of the super-rich has found.

The UK sits well below the likes of France, Germany and America and beats the global average age of 57.

It also has some of the youngest multimillionaires - those with $30 million (£19 million) or more - with an average age of 57 compared to the global average of 60 years of age.

Some of Britain's youngest millionaires include Adele with a fortune of £30million and 17-year-old Nick D'Aloisio who sold his app Summly for £15million.

The figures mean Britain has the second youngest average 
age for both millionaires and multimillionaires in the G8 and the third 
youngest in the G20 after both Russia and China.

Millionaires and multimillionaires tend to be younger in the UK than elsewhere in the Western world because of several factors, says Spear's magazine which carried out the research in association with leading wealth consultancy company WealthInsight. 

Spear's editor Josh Spero said: 'First, we have a long history of entrepreneurialism, building companies which grow to span the world.

'Whether these have been industrial businesses in the Victorian era or financial services today, we have strong examples and a culture which supports it.

'Second, young Britons are often developers and early adopters of technologies, seizing on their potential for business.

'Finally,
we share an approach to business with America, where we try and 
encourage people to make it rather than wrapping them up in red tape and
strangling them with high tax rates, as too often happens in Europe.'

The average age of millionaires and multimillionaires reflects deeper trends in society.

'Japan and Italy have an ageing 
population who live longer and keep hold of their money longer, 
preventing it flowing down to successive generations, whereas Russia 
experiences a free-for-all after the Soviet Union collapsed and 
opportunistic young businessmen acted quickly to get hold of state 
assets.

'Western countries, with greater access to technologies, will be creating millionaires younger too as they take advantage of these new fields of business.

'I hope we see Africa starting to produce generations of millionaires. Its population is young and booming, giving vitality and innovation and a huge potential market.

'Now that technology is reaching Africa much more effectively, its younger generations will be able to bring its benefits to the continent through smart start-ups.

'Added to this is the continent's growing middle class, who need products and services, which businesses will spring up to provide.'

Argentina has the oldest average age of millionaire and multimillionaire in the G20 at 67.8 and 68.1 respectively, reflecting the economic crisis of the 1980s and 1990s which prevented young millionaire and multimillionaire growth.

According to Oliver Williams, an analyst at WealthInsight, these statistics could well change over the next decade.

'We're likely to see a lower average age of millionaires in the UK as 452,000 new millionaires enter the picture between now and 2017.'

However, it is not the same story for Russia:

'The average age difference between millionaires and multimillionaires in Russia - already above average - will further separate as the original oligarchy hold on to their empires into old age.'

Self-made millionaire: Nick D'Aloisio, 17, is one of the youngest self-made millionaires ever after selling his app Summly to Yahoo for £15 million

The 26-year-old heir to H&M, Tom Persson, topped the Sunday Times' 30 richest people under 30 list this year with a staggering estimated fortune of £300 million.

Tom and his brother Karl-Johan are the London-based sons of the richest man in Sweden, Stefan Persson, whose father Erling Persson  founded H&M in Västerås, Sweden, in 1947.

The family retain a 36 per cent stake in the business.

Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe, 24, came second on the list with a fortune of £54 million.

Radcliffe made his acting debut aged 10 in BBC One's 1999 television movie David Copperfield before being chosen to play Harry Potter in the film adaptations of the book when he was 11.

He starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011.

Radcliffe began to branch out to stage acting in 2007, starring in the London and New York productions of Equus, and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.

He went on to star in the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2013 independent film Kill Your Darlings.

Radcliffe's Harry Potter co-star Emma Watson, 23, also made the list with a fortune of £28 million.

Watson was picked to play Hermione Granger at the age of nine, having previously acted only in school plays.

She starred in all eight Harry Potter films, alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint. Watson's work on the Harry Potter series alone has earned her several awards and more than £10 million.

She went on to star in Stephen Chbosky's 2012 film adaptation of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and was cast in the role of Ila in Darren Aronofsky's biblical epic Noah.

Another Harry Potter star, Robert Pattinson, 27, came third with a fortune of £45 million following his success with the Twilight films.

He secured his first major role as Cedric Diggory in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire before landing the leading role of Edward Cullen in the film adaptations of the Twilight novels by Stephenie Meyer.

In 2010, Pattinson was named one of TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential People in The World, and also in the same year Forbes ranked him as one of the most powerful celebrities in the world in the Forbes Celebrity 100.

Actress Keira Knightley, 28, who has starred in films in Pirates Of The Caribbean and Atonement, was fourth on the list with a reported £31 million fortune.

She began acting as a child on television and made her film debut in 1995. Knightley had a supporting role as Sabé in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace before gaining her first significant role came in The Hole in 2001.

She gained widespread recognition in 2002 after co-starring in the film Bend It Like Beckham and achieved international fame in 2003 as a result of appearing as Elizabeth Swann in the Pirates of the Caribbean film series.

She has since starred in numerous films including Pride & Prejudice, Atonement, The Duchess, A Dangerous Method and Anna Karenina.

Forbes has previously claimed she is the second highest paid actress in Hollywood.

Singer Adele, 25, is Britain's richest musician under 30 with an estimated fortune of £30 million, according to the Sunday Times Rich List.

Adele rose to fame after a friend posted her demo on Myspace in 2006 and XL Recordings offered her contract.

Her debut album, 19, was released in 2008 to much commercial and critical success. It certified four times platinum in the UK, and double platinum in the U.S.

She is closely followed on the list by Cheryl Cole, 30, who has amassed a fortune of £14 million.

Cheryl rose to fame in 2002 when she auditioned for the reality television show Popstars: The Rivals on ITV. The programme announced that Cole had won a place as a member of the girl group, Girls Aloud and she has remained a part of the band ever since.

Girls Aloud has achieved 20 top-ten singles - including four number one singles - in the UK and six platinum albums.

Cheryl has also managed to launch a successful solo singing career and a judge on X Factor.

Although Sir Paul McCartney, 71, remained Britain's richest musician this year with a fortune of £680 million.

Meanwhile 17-year-old Nick D'Aloisio, who was born in Australia but brought up in London, became one of Britain's youngest millionaires earlier this year after selling his Summly app to Yahoo for a reported £15 million in March.  

D'Aloisio first started working on the app, which is designed to condense online content into just a few words, when he was 15.

The application sums up popular news stories for readers so they can quickly digest the content without having to read through hundreds or thousands of words.

He is one of the youngest self-made millionaires ever.
