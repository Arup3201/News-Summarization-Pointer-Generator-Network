Radamel Falcao's arrival at Manchester United has seen him move straight into number five on the top 10 most-followed Premier League footballers on Twitter list.

The Colombian, who signed for United in a £6million season-long loan deal on deadline day, knocked new Old Trafford team-mate Robin van Persie down to sixth in the rankings.

Another of Falcao's new team-mates is top, however. Wayne Rooney has an astonishing 9.85million followers, with Falcao on 6.52m and Van Persie on 6.26m.
