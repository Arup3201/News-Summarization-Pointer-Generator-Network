Snowden is expected to be allowed a temporary visa while his asylum application is formally considered

Russia is poised to announce it is freeing US whistleblower Edward Snowden from his airport transit zone hideaway in Moscow, allowing him into the country, it is believed.

The intelligence leaker has applied to the Kremlin for temporary political asylum after the US blocked his travel routes out of Russia.

Snowden, 30, who has been inundated with offers from Russian women of a home and marriage, may have already left Sheremetyevo Airport, where he has been living for a month since fleeing Hong Kong after the US called for him to be arrested, several unconfirmed Russian reports said on Tuesday.

He is expected to be allowed a temporary Russian visa while his asylum application is formally considered.

In Russia, Vladimir Putin has refused to hand him over to America but has also made clear he does not want Snowden to become an issue destabilising relations with Washington.

The American wants to make a permanent home in exile in South America but the US has called on countries he would overfly or transit to arrest him and hand him to the US authorities.

A spokesman at the Air Express transit hotel said Tuesday: 'He is not here.'

His lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said last night: 'As far as I know, Snowden is in Sheremetyevo's transit zone.'

Putin has denied his secret services are tapping the former CIA employee for his intelligence knowledge.

'I am receiving calls from people who ask me to convey their offers of help. Most of the girls are offering Snowden a home and marriage, and men are offering financial support,' said Kucherana.

Among those offering marriage by tweet was glamorous Russian spy Anna Chapman, expelled by the US after being arrested on espionage charges in New York.
