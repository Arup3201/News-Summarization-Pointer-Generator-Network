Adam Lallana believes Liverpool's poor start to the season has partly been down to new players struggling to cope with the high expectations at Anfield after last season's second-placed finish.

Lallana scored twice during his side's 4-1 win against Swansea on Monday night as Brendan Rodgers' side ended the year with three points.

Following his side's win, former Southampton midfielder revealed that some the Liverpool new boys had struggled to adapt quickly to life on Merseyside.

He told Sky Sports: 'It's a massive, massive result. We said before the game it was important we got back-to-back wins and I thought the lads were brilliant tonight (Monday). 

'We've turned a corner the last few weeks but we're still not there yet by any means. I always knew it would be different, no disrespect to Southampton, but the pressures are always different coming to Liverpool and a team like this. 

'The expectations from last season may have come as a bit of shock to the players and some of the new players but Emre (Can) came in today and was outstanding.'

Following Lallana's Man of the Match performance, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher were also full of praise for the 26-year-old.

Speaking of Lallana, Carragher said: 'He's always been the one (of the summer signings) who's stood out from the rest. 

'He maybe hasn't always been at his best but he is a class act. He can take it on both sides, the left and the right side, and he's not a luxury player. He works for the team.

'Lallana is a one of those players who you can't work out if he is left or right-footed. 

'There are very few players who can do that with both feet, maybe Ross Barkley, in England as you usually associate that with foreign players.'

While Neville added: 'The Southampton players understand the game, they know why they're there, and why they need to be there. Lallana learned how to press from his time at Southampton where they train their players so well.'
