Going places: Alex McCarthy looks set to join Queens Park Rangers on a long-term deal

First choice: Robert Green will have to beat off competition from McCarthy if he is going to keep his place

Harry Redknapp wants a long-term successor to veteran keeper Rob Green and has identified the 24-year-old as the man he wants to compete with the ex-England man.

McCarthy will be offered a four-year contract by Rangers if they can agree a deal with the Championship club.

McCarthy burst onto the scene as one of the country’s most promising goalkeepers during Reading’s 2012/13 season in the Barclays Premier League.

He has attracted interest from Arsenal in recent months, but now looks set for a move to Loftus Road.

Rangers also hope to conclude a £1.2million switch for Anfield youngster Robinson before the end of the week.

The-20-year-old can leave Liverpool and Redknapp has moved quickly to snap him up.
