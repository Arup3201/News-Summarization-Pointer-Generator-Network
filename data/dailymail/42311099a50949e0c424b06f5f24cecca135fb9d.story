Horrific: Sarah Leonard was trampled by cows as she was walking in a field with her dog in North Scarle, Lincolnshire

A 59-year-old nurse has been left in intensive care after being trampled by a herd of cows - while taking part in a treasure hunt.

Sarah Leonard was walking in a field with her dog in North Scarle, Lincolnshire, when the group of animals charged, leaving her with life-threatening injuries.

She suffered two broken arms, a broken collarbone, a broken jaw and several broken ribs in the terrifying stampede on Saturday afternoon.

Incredibly, Sarah bravely managed to dial 999 herself but it took paramedics 30 minutes to find her as she did not know where she was.

She was taken to Lincoln County Hospital where she remains in a stable condition after several operations to save her life.

Yesterday her worried brother Andrew Leonard, 62, said: 'She is now very slowly on the mend.'

Sarah, from Norton, Sheffield, had been 'geocaching' - an internet-based high-tech treasure hunt which uses GPS.

A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said: 'We received a call from a woman saying she had been injured and was lying in a field.

'She said she had been hurt when cows stampeded and knocked her over.

'Although she didn’t know exactly where she was, within half-an-hour her car was located at North Scarle cemetery.

'And she was found in the field off Church Lane in the village soon after.

'The woman was in quite a bad way, with severe injuries including a broken jaw and other fractures.'

Sarah’s pet King Charles spaniel Megs was uninjured after she ran off when around a dozen cows charged at them at around 3.25pm.

PCSO Jo Mackie and brother Andrew found the petrified dog cowering in a bush the following day.

The police spokesman added: 'PCSO Mackie was just coming off duty when the incident happened on Saturday.

Most members of the public are wary of bulls, but few realise that cows, particularly those protecting newly-born calves, can also be dangerous.

If you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle, move away as carefully and quietly as possible, and if you feel threatened by cattle then let go of your dog’s lead and let it run free rather than try to protect it and endanger yourself. The dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you.

Those without canine companions should follow similar advice: move away calmly, do not panic and make no sudden noises. Chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat.

If you walk through a field of cows and there happen to be calves, think twice; if you can, go another way and avoid crossing fields.

'And, when she came back on Sunday, she went out with the lady’s brother and - after a search - found her dog, which had run off.'

It is not clear whether Sarah was on private land at the time or whether she had permission to be in the field as part of the hunt.

North Scarle Parish councillor Chris Dixon, added: 'You’d have thought permission would be required from the landowner to bury something on farmland.'

The Geocaching Association of Great Britain’s code of conduct simply states: 'Respect property rights and seek permission where appropriate.'

Its chairman Jen Harkley said: 'News of Sarah’s accident at the weekend did reach us and we have passed on our best wishes for a speedy recovery.

'The GAGB aren’t able to discuss the accident as we don’t know the circumstances or details of her injuries.

'However, I have sent a message to one of her geocaching friends who is in contact with her family.'

Pete Dudley posted Miss Leonard’s plight on the Geocaching Midlands Facebook page.

He said: 'Take care out there folks. Unfortunately, I have some upsetting news.

'Sarah Leonard was caching on Saturday and she was stampeded by a herd of cows. Unfortunately this left her seriously injured and she is now in intensive care in hospital.

'She has a number of fractures, is stable and is sedated for pain control.'

Geocaching involves hiding a small waterproof box containing a logbook and a pen, recording its co-ordinates and logging its location on a website.

Another 'cacher' will see the listing, enter the co-ordinates into their GPS receiver and go in search of it.

It is similar to the 150-year-old game letterboxing, which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories.

Geocaching was invented in 2000 when GPS readings became more accurate.

In total there are two million geocaches all over the world and more than five million people take part in the activity globally.

Most members of the public are wary of bulls, but few realise that cows, particularly those protecting newly-born calves, can also be dangerous.

Health and Safety Executive figures show that over 480 people have been injured by cows in the past eight years.

Last year Sandra Wiltshire, 68, died alongside her beloved golden Labrador, Bruce, after she was trampled by cows in a field near their home in Chippenham in Wiltshire.

In 2009 the deaths of four people trampled by cows within a period of two months led the National Farmers Union to issue a warning.

In June, vet Liz Crowsley, 49, was walking her dogs along the Pennine Way, in West Yorkshire when she was charged by a herd and died.

It is thought the animals became alarmed by her dogs, although they were on leads, because they were protecting their calves.

In July, Anita Hinchey, 63, was walking with a friend in St Fagans, near Cardiff, when she fell among a herd. An inquest heard she was trying to put her dog back on its lead.

That month, Barry Pilgrim, 65, was also fatally attacked in Sheldon, Derbyshire. Police again feared the cows has become 'over-protective'.

A farmer died from serious head and chest injuries after he was trampled by cows, which appear to have been scared by a fire engine in August.

Harold Lee, 75, was bringing up the rear of a herd of 100 dairy cows being led along a country lane, when they turned and bolted towards him.
