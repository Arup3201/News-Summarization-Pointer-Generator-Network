They may look like humble garden sheds from the outside. But they are in fact the latest innovation in affordable housing.

Complete with their own kitchen, bathroom and living space, these tiny homes on wheels could be the solution for any young buyer struggling to get on the property ladder.

Created by Mark Brown, the designs have started a miniature home movement that is becoming popular in the US and Britain.

Home sweet home: Tiny homes on wheels could be the solution to getting on the property ladder at an affordable price

All the mod cons: The tiny homes can come complete with a fully functioning kitchen, shower and toilet

Prices start from £10,000 ($15,400) for a basic shell and a fully fitted home costs up to £18,000 ($27,800).

The homes are built in Mark's UK-based Tiny House workshop and towed to the desired location of their buyer on special built in wheels.

Despite their cramped appearance, the homes can sleep up to six people and are fitted with a fully functioning kitchen, shower and toilet.

The homes are also energy efficient - they arrive fully insulated.

Environmentally friendly: The small homes are good for conserving energy - they come fully insulated

Comfortable: Complete with sofa space the tiny homes can sleep up to six people despite their snug appearance

Mark, a builder for more than 15 years, came up with the idea after the credit crunch meant building work became a lot harder to find.

Mark said: 'I think they are a fantastic idea because people can live cheaply with very low outgoings. If they ever decide to move they can simply take their home with them and with a bit of TLC, I don’t see any reason they couldn’t last a lifetime.

Spacious: The homes feature a double bed sized sleeping space on a mezzanine floor away from the main living area

'The majority of interest in our Tiny Houses comes from the younger generation who are desperate to get on the property ladder in some way.

'Tiny Houses are not only compact but are very cheap to run which helps the owner save money towards a deposit on a proper ‘bricks and mortar’ house.

'Some people laugh and point when they see one being towed down the high street but when they see the inside, the phrase "wow" and "oh my God" is used a lot.'
