A rise in lamb prices has led to s spate of sheep rustling across the country

The rising cost of lamb has triggered a rural crime wave, with farmers £6million-a-year to sheep rustlers.

In recent weeks there has been a spate of thefts of 
sheep and lambs across the country, including in Northumberland, County 
Durham and Yorkshire.

Now senior Conservative MP Anne McIntosh has accused the government of failing to take rural crime seriously, and questioned if the Tories could still claim to be the ‘party of the countryside’.

The issue of rural crime is to be debated in the Commons tomorrow.

The value of sheep has risen sharply since the start of the year, from around £50 per ewe in January to £75 in mid-March.

Nearly one farm a week is being raided 
in the valley of Swaledale in North Yorkshire, with £120,000 worth of 
livestock disappearing in 25 separate raids over just ten months.

Mrs McIntosh told MailOnline: ‘I am not sure any prosecutions have been brought. The financial value to the farmer is huge. If they are stolen at this time of year before lambing, they have lost the mother sheep – the ewe – and the lambs.

‘They will take whatever is in the field.  Why is this crime, an economic crime, being treated any less seriously than a crime taking place in an urban area? It does seem to be quite widespread.’

Mrs McIntosh, who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, tabled a series of parliamentary questions on the scale of the problem but drew a blank.

She added: ‘I do believe it is something Defra should taking seriously. I always thought the Conservative part as the party of the countryside… I do believe we have got to take rural crime seriously.

‘It is very disappointing that a rural crime of quite large proportions financially is going unprosecuted.’

Insurers NFU Mutual warn sheep rustling is costing farmers £6million every year

Sheep rustling is a crime and is covered under the Theft Act 1968. The Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs insist they have not had any formal representations about sheep rustling.

But Tim Price, rural affairs spokesman at insurers NFU Mutual, said:
‘During the decade to 2010, livestock rustling had been at historically low
levels, while rural thieves concentrated on easy pickings - stealing quad
bikes, tractors and expensive power tools from farms. 

Tory MP Anne McIntosh accused the government of failing to take rural crime seriously

‘Now however, high meat prices and improved security on farm
vehicles appear to be leading to a resurgence in livestock rustling. In the
last few years we have seen a worrying increase in thefts in all livestock
rearing parts of the UK.

‘Rustling is one of the world's oldest crimes. Since the
first cavemen kept goats, rustling has been a feature of farming. However, the
worrying trend today is that instead of small numbers of animals being taken in
one attack, we are increasingly seeing very large numbers of sheep being
stolen.’

NFU Mutual's claims figures show that the cost of rustling has
risen dramatically since 2010, up 170 per cent in 2011 and 3.6 per cent in 2012

People who live in the countryside are now being urged to ‘keep
an eye on sheep in fields near their homes, and report and suspicious activity
to local farmers or the police’.

Farmers and butchers buying stock are also being told to
check livestock records and ear tags carefully to make sure they are not buying
stolen animals.

Last year rustling is estimated to have cost UK farmers
over £6m, with the South West, North West and North East hardest hit.

Home Office minister Norman Baker said: ‘It is for Police and Crime Commissioners to ensure that forces use those resources to tackle the crimes that matter most to the communities they serve, including sheep rustling where that is a local priority.

‘The Government will provide £8.5 billion to the police in England and Wales in 2014-15, demonstrating our continued commitment to protecting the public from crime. In addition, the police receive around a quarter of their total funding from the police precept component of council tax.’
