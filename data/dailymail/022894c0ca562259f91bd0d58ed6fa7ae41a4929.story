Centre stage:Laura Wright performed both the English and Scottish national anthems before the Six Nations game at Twickenham yesterday

With her nerve-racking appearance singing to 81,000 Six Nations fans out of the way, you might imagine soprano Laura Wright would have had enough of rugby for one weekend.

But today she will be back on the pitch – only this time the elegant thigh-slit dress and heels will be ditched for boots and a mud-spattered kit. And the crowd? About 50, weather permitting.

For not only is the 22-year-old the national anthem singer for the England side, she also plays full-back for Rosslyn Park Ladies - the aptly named ‘Slingbacks’ -  in South-West London.

And Laura admits that whether she’s singing at Twickers or running out at Rosslyn Park, the butterflies still kick in. ‘I get nervous for both, believe it or not.’

It probably won’t be a capacity crowd 
for the Rosslyn Park ladies match against Blackheath today – and a 
water-logged pitch was threatening to scrap the fixture, but Laura has 
got the rugger bug.

‘I’m used to standing in a concert hall 
on my own, but playing rugby gives me the opportunity to be part of a 
team so we can celebrate together or support each other if we lose!’ she
 told the Mail on Sunday.

Laura, who has twice sung at Wembley 
Stadium and performed for the Queen said she does not let fear of being 
hurt on the field curb her love of the game.

‘I’m not the kind of person to live life carefully,’ she said. ‘It is full-on contact rugby I play.’

‘It’s a different feeling stepping out onto a pitch in a glamorous dress and heels compared to boots and gumshield,’ said Laura.

‘From playing rugby, I definitely 
found even more respect for professional sportsmen and how focused 
dedicate you must be.’

Laura added: ‘I’m all about live 
performances, for me it is live or not at all. As a fan, I’d feel 
cheated if someone mimed in a stadium.

Pitch perfect: But the soprano will today turn out for her local rugby side Rosslyn Park Ladies in South-West London, potentially watched by a mere 50 spectators

‘At Twickenham, it is incredibly hard to hear yourself, there is a lot of background noise, but a real buzz to peform.

‘I see my role as an opportunity to build interest in the women’s game.’

Her appointment as the official anthem
 ‘voice’ last year came as something of a shock for her main rival Camilla Kerslake, who also happens to be the girlfriend of 
England XV captain Chris Robshaw.

Miss Kerslake, 24, was born in London but has a Welsh 
mother and a Kiwi father. She has sung at four England 
games at Twickenham as well as royal charity concerts. 

But when asked on Twitter whether she would be singing yesterday, Camilla said: ‘I’ll be in the stands cheering for my man!’

Laura trains 
twice a week for Rosslyn Park, and manager Liz Delves said that in her 
first season she had impressed her team-mates.

‘She’s got speed and good technical 
awareness,’ said Miss Delves.  ‘We generally get between 50 and 60 people 
watching our matches, so it’s not quite Twickenham, but the passion is 
there just the same.’

Laura will create history when she 
sings for England ladies on February 23rd when they play their 
international against France on the same pitch and same day as the men, a
 first for the championship.
