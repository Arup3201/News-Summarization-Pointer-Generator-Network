The woman at the center of the latest sex scandal to hit shamed Anthony Weiner has admitted that Bill and Hillary Clinton may be ‘embarrassed’ by her secret affair with the New York mayoral candidate.

Weiner’s wife Huma Abedin is one of Hillary Clinton’s closest aides and has been described as a ‘second daughter’ to the former Secretary of State and her husband – while former President Clinton officiated over the Weiners’ marriage in July 2010.

And Sydney Leathers, 23, a political science student who had a lengthy furtive online affair with Weiner, 48, last year, told MailOnline exclusively: ‘I have a feeling they don't like me too much right now, because obviously Bill Clinton married them and Huma works with Hillary very closely, so I'm sure it’s embarrassing.’

Weiner has so far insisted he will not step down from the mayoral race, and when asked if the Democrats should ask him to leave the party, Sydney replied: ‘I feel that most Democrats, especially Democrat women, do not want to be connected to someone like that.

‘Nancy Pelosi’s already spoken out 
and I don’t think he should be representing the party, I’ll say that. I 
do feel he’s a bad representation of the party. I do feel he’s sexist 
and he doesn’t even realize it, he’s a sexist pig.’

Bill and Hill won't be happy: Sydney Leathers says her affair with Anthony Weiner will have 'embarrassed' them

daughter’ to the former Secretary of State and her husband, pictured together, right

Last
 night, a source who had worked closely with the Clintons told 
MailOnline: ‘The fact is that Bill and Hillary don’t like Anthony – but 
they love Huma, they adore her. She’s extremely loyal, capable and she’s
 been with Hillary forever.

‘But there are now serious doubts as to why Huma would possibly put herself through this and what the benefits would be.

‘If
 the Clintons phone Huma and say ‘it’s time, you have to protect 
yourself’, Anthony will have to drop out of the campaign, and he will 
have to drop this public flagellation – he’ll have no choice.’

Sydney,
 who has spared no detail in discussing her affair with Weiner and his 
obsession with her feet – as well as his fantasises about renting her a condo 
in Chicago – added that she was certain that Huma was away with Hillary 
during most of the times she spoke to the politician at his marital 
home.

She said: ‘I’m 
assuming that Huma was away traveling with Hillary Clinton. I just 
would assume that he wouldn’t do that while she was there. He would just
 go right into his fantasy.’

The
 Clintons are so close to Huma that they hosted a garden party for her 
wedding with more than 300 people at their Washington D.C home in 2010, with a massive 
buffet of Mideastern food and a sign with the couple's wedding date, 
"7-10-10," near the pool.

'I have one daughter,' said former President Clinton as he gave Huma a hug, 'But if I had a second daughter, it would Huma.'

The
 striking brunette, who last week stunned onlookers as she spoke out to say she would be standing by her husband amid his latest sex scandal, has been been working as Hillary's right hand since 
1996, and has been by her side through the Senate and presidential campaigns and 
move to the State Department.

She is also linked by many to join Hillary on a potential 2016 campaign to bid for the White House.

Giving a speech at the party, Hillary told the crowd that it was 'love at first sight' for Weiner.

And a report at the time told how the
 Clintons encouraged the match between the Muslim beauty who grew up in 
Saudi Arabia and the Jewish Democrat from New York City. The couple 
represented, Bill said in his toast, what he wanted 'the future of the 
world to be'.

However, the source said: ‘Their silence now is an expression of their support for Huma, but not for Anthony.’

Like Huma, Hillary Clinton stood by her man after revelations about his sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky emerged in 1998. Weiner's campaign has referred to the Clinton scandal to convince Democrats that voters can still support the mayoral candidate despite his indiscretions.

And the source told MailOnline: 'The contrast between the Bill and Hillary situation to this is that it concerned a Presidency, it was prior to the midterm elections and there were a lot of policy issues on the line.

'This was a presidency that had made a serious difference on all sorts of issues, there were matters facing the country at stake, there was an incentive for Hillary to stand by her man.

'By contrast here, he's not in office and the future of the city is not at risk. As much as there is so much positive about Huma, it's not like anyone needs her to be First Lady of New York. She's already being subjected to a Senate inquiry over work payment, it's all above board and she has a right to earn a living, but you do have people now asking questions.

'hopefully this won't be an issue for Hillary, Huma should have a right to be part of any campaign she runs.'

Yesterday,
 Huma was visited by her mother Saleha Mahmood Abedin at her New York 
home, while Weiner was seen taking their 16-month-old son Jordan out for
 a walk.

When asked why 
she thought why Weiner wants to be mayor so badly, Sydney said: ‘I know he has a 
certainly amount of money from campaign funds and that he basically had 
to use it or lose it so to speak. So it was like, ‘well, might as well 
run even if I’m not going to win. I’ve got all of this money to spend’ 
and it just gets him more attention.’

Crushingly,
 Sydney said Weiner never mentioned his wife during their liaison, and 
admitted that she had pondered whether their sex life was not so great, 
adding ‘I would think a happily married man probably wouldn’t do that. I
 would want to think so anyway.

‘It
 was almost as if he wanted to pretend of that part of his life wasn’t 
really happening. I never asked about her, I didn’t think that was 
appropriate.

‘He never told
 me he wanted to leave her, but he did hint at the fact there were some 
problems or some problems with her family regarding the first scandal 
and just embarrassment. I knew that everyone was upset by the first 
scandal.

‘He never said he 
felt bad, absolutely not. I think he feels bad when he gets caught or 
feels Huma’s wrath, but I don’t think he cares at all other than that.'

Interestingly,
 Sydney said she believes that Weiner may get a kick out of his sexting 
scandals being made public, adding: ‘I have wondered that. He may 
secretly like the attention, like people knowing he can get all of these
 women to talk to him. He said in a press conference he couldn’t even 
remember the exact number of women he had been talking to since he 
resigned from congress.

‘It
 kind of felt like he was bragging to me. I do think he gets a sexual 
kick out of being in the middle of this. I think he likes the attention,
 I think he’s kind of an ego maniac.’

Confessing
 that she feels ‘very sorry’ for Huma, Sydney sniffed: ‘I feel bad, but 
then again, I’m not the one who’s married to her. Anthony should feel 
much worse than I do, I think anyway.

‘I
 would just say I’m sorry that she’s hurt. I‘m, sorry she’s 
embarrassed. If I could take it back, I would, but I can’t, so the only 
thing I can do now is just to apologize.

‘She’s very beautiful, I think she’s too good for him, I really do. That’s what baffles me about them staying together.

‘I
 think she seems to be a very classy sophisticated woman. He’s sleazy, a
 liar, not someone that you would think a woman like that would want to 
be married to, in my mind. And hugely dishonest, to say the least.’
