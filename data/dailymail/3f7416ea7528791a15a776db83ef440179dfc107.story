Agent Provocateur is taking former Made In Chelsea star Kimberley Garner to court.

The British lingerie brand has accused the willowy blonde of copying one of its swimwear designs.

According to the underwear retailer, which was founded in 1994, 23-year-old Kimberley's swimwear label, Kimberley London, is selling a bikini that is too similar to one of its own bestsellers.

Agent Provocateur have filed a case which accuses Kimberley Garner of copying their Mazzy bikini (L) when creating her Monaco two-piece (R)

The action, filed at the Patents County Court in London, accuses the reality star turned swimwear designer of copying their Mazzy bikini when creating her Monaco two-piece.

Both swimwear garments have a triangle-shape top and several straps around the body, as well as a cut-away brief.

The Agent Provocateur design costs £110 for the top and £85 for the briefs, while Kimberley's costs £85 for the full set.

In a statement, Garry Hogarth, CEO of Agent Provocateur, said: 'We invest significantly in product design and development, and the Mazzy is our bestselling swimwear design.

'We have bought this action to protect our intellectual property, our designers and our business.'

Kimberley told The Metro that the situation has been ‘a nightmare’ and that she will be defending her creations in court.

'I
set up this company and I’m 23 and I’ve put all my savings into making 
this a success. [The suit from Agent Provocateur] has been hard,’ she 
told the newspaper.

Speaking
to MailOnline, she said: 'It does seems that Agent Provocateur are doing this just for publicity, as you can see from how many extremely similar pieces that are ready available on the market.

'They are a large company and their representative has actually said that 'their intention is publicity.

'There are so many other well known designers 
selling bikinis that are so similar, as the strappy bikini is very much 
on trend. They are a multi-million pound giant trying to intimidate a 23
year old.

'It's been 
really hard, especially as Kimberley London swimwear is my own company, 
it's just me. There seems to be no room for small start up companies

'My only hope is this doesn't put off other young people from starting up their own company. It is a lot of work and a lot of fun and I want to continue as it has been successful.

'I'm always thrilled when girls write to me saying how they love my Kimberley London bikinis and how great they feel, makes it all worthwhile.'

A spokesperson for Agent Provocateur told MailOnline: 'Agent Provocateur is very supportive of entrepreneurs and small businesses.

'In the case of Kimberley Garner and her company, Kimberley London Ltd, we have evidence of Kimberley buying a Mazzy bikini in one of our stores.

'It is our belief that her Monaco bikini is a copy of the design rights in the Mazzy. We invest significantly in product design and development and the Mazzy is our best-selling swimwear design.

'We have brought this action to protect our intellectual property, our designers and our business.'

At the time of launch, Kimberley told MailOnline that she has always dreamed of launching her own swimwear line

The property heiress, who shot to fame on E4's Made In Chelsea, launched her range in May this year.

While
her collection only launched few months ago, she insists that she's 
been coming up with ideas for the range since the tender age of nine.

She told MailOnline at the time: 'I've been 
working on this range since 1 January but I've had the ideas since I 
was a child and I got told off for sewing sequins onto a bikini while I 
was in school!'

Kimberley funded the range herself and imported the fabric from Italy, while 
the tiny gold coin and 'K' details that feature on her designs were made in France.

The
reality star's range starts at £65 and each piece is named after her favourite holiday destinations,  including The Hamptons, Saint Tropez and Ibiza.

She said of the range: 'I wanted to 
make my designs wholesome but also sexy and cheeky, and provide an 
aspirational image for young girls.'
