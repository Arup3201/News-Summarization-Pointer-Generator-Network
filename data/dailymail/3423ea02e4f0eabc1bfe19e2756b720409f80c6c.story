Gun owners in Georgia are now free to take weapons into churches, bars, libraries, schools and airports thanks to a new law relaxing gun control rules.

New legislation, which came into effect yesterday, means that the 500,000 Georgians with a gun licence will be allowed to to enter the public buildings with their weapons openly displayed.

Critics described the bill as a 'guns everywhere' law and say it is the most extreme in the U.S. and could lead to more violent crime.

Opposition: Critics, who call the legislation a 'guns everywhere' law, protested against it but did not stop gun activists securing the dramatic expansion in the number of places they can freely bear arms

Gun enthusiasts have hailed the legislation, named the Safe Carry Protection Act, as a triumph of their constitutional right to bear arms.

Bars and 'unsecured' government buildings, such as libraries, will be expected to allow gun carriers in by default, while other locations, such as churches, will need to opt in before guns are freely allowed on site.

Airports are also covered by the legislation, although guns will continue to be banned in restricted areas and will not be allowed on flights.

Jubilant gun owners celebrating at a shooting range in Atlanta yesterday said the new law vindicates rights 'given to us by God'.

One activist told Sky News: 'It's a victory for the second amendment rights ... the right to keep and bear arms.'

Another said: 'Those rights are protected by the constitution and are given to us by God'.

The law faced heavy opposition while moving through the state's senate. Controversial clauses allowing guns to be carried on university campuses were struck out while the law was being drawn up.

Some surveys showed that a majority of Georgians opposed the law, but lawmakers in the state had the powerful gun lobby to contend with, which piles pressure on legislators to support the rights on gun owners.

The loosening of laws in Georgia could lead to the same happening in other states, while Tennessee, Oklahoma Missouri have recently passed their own laws.

'Idiotic': Critics fear that the new gun laws will lead to a rise in violent crime

Triumphant: Gun activists say it is their right to carry weapons where they like, and deny a link to violence

When the signing-in took place in April, Alan Gottlieb, the founder of pressure group the Second Amendment Foundation, told MailOnline: 'You will see other states start to adopt this concept and it will spread across America'.

On social media, the law was roundly condemned, though some activists defended the rules.

Briton Joe Difford tweeted: 'The "guns everywhere" legislation in Georgia is the most idiotic law ever. Having a gun won't make you safe because everyone else has one!'

Sarah Jennifer added: 'Ah America, after more mass shootings earlier this year? REALLY?! You'll never learn, will you?'

Michael Weston, a gun activist from the U.S., tweeted: 'New Georgia gun law set to take effect and Liberals say: the sky is falling, as usual, NO facts just faux hysteria.'
