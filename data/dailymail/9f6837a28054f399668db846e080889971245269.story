When David Beckham was unveiled as the face of luxury leather label Belstaff women worldwide were left weak at the knees.

And if the campaign images of him posing in his leathers weren't enough, the brand has today unveiled an accompanying biking documentary starring the man himself.

The short film, titled For The Open Road, features Becks and his biker buddies on a journey from the Goodwood Estate in West Sussex to the Belstaff flagship on New Bond Street.

Speaking about the adventure, David, who rides his beloved Super Vintage 93 Knuckle bike, said: 'What I love about riding is the freedom.'

The leather-clad boys are joined by 50 bikers at the end of the film, directed by Justin Stokes from production company HLA.

They then all drive down New Bond Street for the opening of the flagship Belstaff store.

And Beckham fans will be pleased to hear that, while is has not yet been announced, a special Beckham for Belstaff Collection is on the cards, according to Grazia Daily.

Speaking to the fashion magazine, 38-year-old David said: 'I began wearing a lot of Belstaff a few years back when I started riding bikes. I actually found my first [Belstaff jacket] when I was shopping in a vintage store, funnily enough, about six or seven years ago and I still wear that when I'm riding.

'I love being able to work with great brands with a lot of history and when they are British brands it's even better.'

Big plans: Grazia have reported that a special Beckham for Belstaff Collection is on the cards

On the road: The concept behind the shoot captures a 'band of brothers traveling across the English countryside' led by Beckham, naturally

The retired footballer was announced as the new face of luxury brand Belstaffâ€™s 2014 advertising campaign at the start of this month.

Shot
 on UK soil in Buckinghamshire by German photographer, Peter Lindberg, the creative concept behind the shoot 
captures a â€˜band of brothers traveling across the English countrysideâ€™ 
led by Beckham.

And it seems that David enjoyed filming so much that, when asked if he would ever do a Ewan McGreggor and go on his own Belstaff biking trek, David told Grazia: 'Maybe! I've got four kids to get to school and pick up from school so if I ever find the time, yeah maybe.'

Beckham has also famously modelled in 
the past for brands such as Armani and, of course, to promote his own 
underwear range for H&M.
