Sweden is reeling after a third night of rioting in largely run-down immigrant areas of the capital Stockholm.

In the last 48 hours violence has spread to at least ten suburbs with mobs of youths torching hundreds of cars and clashing with police.

It is Sweden's worst disorder in years and has shocked the country and provoked a debate on how Sweden is coping with youth unemployment and an influx of immigrants.

The disorder has intensified despite a call for calm from Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt.

Last night, rioters attacked the police 
station in the Jakosberg area in the northwest of the city and set fire to 30 cars.  

Groups of youths also smashed shop windows and burned down a 19th Century cultural centre.

Gangs of up to 60 set fire to a school and a nursery and hurled rocks at police and firefighters.

The unrest appears to have been sparked by 
the police killing of a 69-year-old man wielding a machete in the suburb
 of Husby on Sunday, which prompted accusations of police brutality.

It has provoked fierce debate in the country,  which prides itself
 on a reputation for social justice, on the government's economic policies.

The violence has sparked debate in the country on the effect of the government's social policies

Critics say immigrant ghettos have been created where unemployment is high and there are few opportunities for residents.

The left-leaning tabloid Aftonbladet 
said the riots represented a 'gigantic failure' of government policies, 
which had underpinned the rise of ghettos in the suburbs.

'We
 have failed to give many of the people in the suburbs a hope for the 
future,' Anna-Margrethe Livh of the opposition Left Party wrote in the 
daily Svenska Dagbladet.

An
 anti-immigrant party, the Sweden Democrats, has risen to third in polls
 ahead of a general election due next year, reflecting unease about 
immigrants among many voters.

Many believe the riots are a result of anger at high unemployment and fewer opportunities among immigrants

Eight people were arrested last night but police said they had no reports of injuries.

Kjell Lindgren, spokesman for Stockholm police, said today: 'We've had around 30 cars set on fire last night, fires that we connect to youth gangs and criminals.' 

Prime Minister Reinfeldt told reporters yesterday: 'Everyone must pitch in restore calm - parents [and] adults.'

After decades of practising the 
'Swedish model' of generous welfare benefits, the country has been 
reducing the role of the state since the 1990s, spurring the fastest 
growth in inequality of any advanced OECD economy.

While
 average living standards are still among the highest in Europe, 
governments have failed to substantially reduce long-term youth 
unemployment and poverty, which have affected immigrant communities 
worst.

Some 15 per cent of the population is foreign-born, the highest proportion in the Nordic region.

Unemployment among those born outside Sweden stands at 16 per cent, compared with just six per cent for native Swedes, according to OECD data.

Among 44 industrialised countries, Sweden ranked fourth in the absolute number of asylum seekers, and second relative to its population, according to U.N. figures.
