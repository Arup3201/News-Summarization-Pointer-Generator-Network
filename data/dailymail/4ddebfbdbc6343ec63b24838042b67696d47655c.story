With a trusting gaze, silky ears and the fluffiest of coats, this little pup would melt the hardest of hearts.

His owner, however, must have had no heart at all. She abandoned him, frightened and bewildered, in the ladies’ toilets at a motorway service station.

Staff found him hours later cowering at the back of a cubicle, curled up in a ball and whimpering in fear.

Cute: The miniature Shetland sheepdog was discovered in the ladies toilets at a service station in Sandbach, Cheshire. Vets will carry out tests to see if his sight can be restored

They soon realised the pup, thought to be a miniature Shetland sheepdog and about eight weeks old, was blind.

And they believe his owner, hoping to cash in on the trend for tiny ‘designer’ dogs, realised this made him worthless and abandoned him.

His cries had alerted a customer, who told staff that there was a strange noise in the toilets. ‘He had been left in a cubicle behind the bin,’ said Sue Evans, director of the Roadchef services at Sandbach in Cheshire.‘He was curled up and looked frightened.’ 

She said colleague Angela Lonsdale, who works in the WH Smith at the site, had found the pup.

‘She managed to coax him out and we cleaned him up and wrapped him in one of the dog blankets we have on sale.

‘He had these piercing blue eyes, but he wasn’t making direct eye contact, which was when we realised he was blind.’

The sad start in life for this puppy illustrates the lottery of buying a so-called designer dog.

While his history may never be known, he is thought to be a miniature Shetland sheepdog – which not a recognised breed in this country and is seen as part of the celebrity-driven fashion for tiny ‘handbag’ dogs.

These pets are often associated with health problems as they are frequently the product of unscrupulous backstreet ‘puppy farmers’. They can also be imported from abroad, and are sold online for £500 or more.

According to the Kennel Club, one in five puppies bought through websites or social media die within six months.

In the US, breeders have raised fears that puppies sold as miniature Shetland sheepdogs are prone to weak bones, water on the brain and blood sugar disorders. Sadly some will be abandoned by disappointed buyers.

Standard Shetland sheepdogs are normally around 14in tall, though can be anywhere from 13in to 16in.

Staff have examined CCTV footage of the entrance to the services but believe the woman who abandoned the puppy hid him from sight as she went to the toilets. There are no other clues to her identity.

‘All we can think is that she found out he was blind and decided to dump him,’ Mrs Evans said. ‘It was an awful thing to do.’

But despite his difficult start in life, the puppy has at least found a happy ending. After being rescued three weeks ago, he was adopted by the services’ maintenance manager Ian Schofield, who already has a terrier named Belle and couldn’t resist the pup. ‘Belle has been like a mother to him,’ Mrs Evans added. ‘She acts as his eyes and barks out instructions to him.’

And now staff have set up an online appeal to raise money to cover the pup’s veterinary bills – which include a consultation with a specialist to see whether his sight can be restored. Last night it had raised £540. Workers and customers have also been paying £1 each to vote for the puppy’s new name, with the total – currently around £120 – going towards cancer charities. The leading choice so far is Louie, after the loo where he was discovered.

‘The saving grace is that he was left where people would find him,’ Mrs Evans said.
