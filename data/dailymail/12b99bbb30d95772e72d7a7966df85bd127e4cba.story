For most people, managing to catch one baseball at a Major League game would be considered something of a proud and memorable moment.

But one baseball fan has taken things to another level entirely after collecting a staggering 7,537 balls, which he keeps in his apartment in Manhattan, New York.

Zack Hample, 36, has now made it his life's mission to collect 10,000 balls by snagging them from the stands at games.

Mr Hample estimates he has spent somewhere in the region of $100,000 and tens of thousands of hours honing his technique for being in the right place at the right time.

He said: 'I wasn't good enough to be a Major League Baseball player but I'm still probably better at judging and catching fly balls than 99.9 per cent of the public.

'When I'm at a game and the ball goes up in the air I'm not even looking at it - I'm already running and climbing over rows and planning my path and dodging vendors and people.

'Then I look up and if I've done a good job the ball's right there for me to catch.'

Mr Hample, who has even written books teaching others how to catch balls at games, began his hobby at the age of 15 and soon became obsessed with collecting balls.

He now attends roughly three games every week during the course of the baseball season and has come up with a number of tricks to ensure he never leaves a stadium empty-handed.

He said: 'There are a lot of strategies I use to catch so many baseballs, starting with showing up early for batting practice and bringing a glove.

'I get a lot of balls thrown to me by the players and I ask foreign guys in their native languages.

'I have a hat and shirt of all Major League teams, so I can dress up like I'm a fan of whatever team is on the field.

'I'm definitely obsessed with this, it's definitely an addiction.'

However, his passion for collecting baseballs leaves little time for long-suffering girlfriend, Hayley, 20.

She said: 'I think if push came to shove and he had to choose he'd probably go with baseball but that's just who he is.

'There's just no escaping it when I'm with him and it's game time.

'I think I would be less supportive of it if he weren't the king of it, but since he basically created this whole world I feel like I have to support him.'

Now Mr Hample, whose first book was called How To Snag Major League Baseballs, says he won't stop until he has collected 10,000 baseballs.

He said: 'Perhaps the biggest appeal for me in collecting baseballs is feeling like I'm beating the odds and getting something special.

'When the ball sails through the air 40,000 people are watching it - and who knows how many hundreds of thousands of people at home - and that ball ends up in my glove.

'It's just the most amazing feeling, there's really not much else in the world that compares with that.'
