A recovering anorexic has turned his life around after discovering body building - and has now been signed up to be a model.

Bullied as a teen at school for being overweight, Carl Creasy, now 22, drastically reduced his food intake, existing on as little as one apple and a small green salad a day.

By the time he was 20, Carl's weight had plummeted to just 5st 5lb, leaving him dangerously thin

But after a friend persuaded him that eating the right foods would give him the muscular figure he'd always wanted, Carl, now a fitness instructor, managed to turn his life around.

Now weighing a healthy 10 stone, Carl hopes to take part in a bodybuilding competition in Miami this year.

Healthy: Carl Creasy, 22, beat anorexia after being introduced to bodybuilding by a friend and is now a model

Frightening: At his most ill, Carl weighed just 5st 5lb and was 'obsessed' with weight

'I used to do whatever I could to avoid food and sometimes wouldn't come home just so I could avoid having to eat,' explains Carl, who also fronts a show on Sky's Active channel.

'I was addicted to the scales and if I wasn't losing weight I would increase my exercise. Sometimes I would go through the day [eating] just one apple.'

Carl's battle with anorexia began in his teens after he was bullied about being overweight.

Distraught, he began restricting his food intake in a bid to slim down and achieve the perfect body.

'I constantly felt tired and moody,' he says of his life while anorexic.

'It affected my concentration and I ended up missing classes at college because I just couldn't get up.

'I didn't even enjoy spending time with friends and felt embarrassed when speaking to people.

'Controlling my eating took over my life.'

He added: 'I would eat the same things everyday as my body felt comfortable consuming these foods.

'I did everything 
wrong which was causing damage to my health.

'I now know I could 
have even died if I continued the way I was going.'

But a chance meeting with a friend 
helped him turn his life around - much to the delight of his family who 
had grown increasingly worried about the toll the eating disorder had 
taken on his heath.

Carl, who had always wanted a muscular physique, was impressed by his fitness-loving friend's strong body and was fascinated by the revelation that getting a honed body meant eating more, not less.

'He basically told me the more I trained, the more food my 
body would need to grow muscles,' he explains. 'We
then went training together and it started from there.'

Inspiring: Carl hopes his story will give hope to other men and boys battling with eating disorders

Carl, who now works with bodybuilding supplements brand LA Muscle, dreams of appearing on the cover of Men's Health magazine and hopes his story will inspire other boys and men struggling with eating disorders.

'My image is very important to me and I always take on board what 
people say. People were saying I needed to eat as I am too skinny but that was the one thing I ignored until I took a liking to my friend's 
physique and how good muscles and definition actually look.

'I want to encourage others to help beat their eating disorder and tell them that skipping meals is not the way forward.'

His family are equally thrilled by his change of heart. 'They were seriously worried about my health,' says Carl.

'Everyone is so proud of me now and relieved that I managed to beat anorexia as it was affecting my home life as well as overall health.'

Although, according to NHS figures, one in 10 of those diagnosed with eating disorders are male, the problem is far less likely to be talked about - something Carl hopes to change.

He added: 'I hope my story will inspire people with food problems. Life is too short not to enjoy food -Â  you only live once.'
