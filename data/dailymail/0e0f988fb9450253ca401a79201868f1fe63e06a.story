Troubled: A childhood friend says Jason Smith, who is charged with murder, had behavioural problems as a child

A rodent exterminator charged with the murder of a paediatrician suffered from behavioural problems as a child, according to a family friend.

Jason T. Smith, 36, an exterminator of Levittown, Pennsylvania, last week confessed that he had strangled, bound and burned Dr Melissa Ketunuti in her apartment after an argument where she 'belittled him'.

The family friend from many years ago, speaking on condition of anonymity, told ABC News that Smith had behavior and anger issues and liked to set things on fire.

Smith faces charges of murder, arson, abuse of a corpse and causing/risking a catastrophe.

Smith told investigators he committed 
the crime because he felt like Ketunuti was disrespecting him and belittling him when he performed work on her home.

Smith went to the doctor's home originally because of a rodent problem in her basement.

An argument ensued, he struck her, she fell to the ground and he started to strangle her with a rope and set her alight, police revealed in a press conference last week.

After he killed her, he went straight to another job in New Jersey.

Smith's neighbors spoke of their shock over his confession.

Meghan Fenstermaker said: 'It's crazy 
because...he's outside always playing 
with his children. I mean, he doesn't seem like that kind of guy.

'So, 
that's why I'm really shocked at what's going on right now, because he 
does seem like a family man. He doesn't seem like that kind of guy. So, 
that's why this is very shocking.'

Smith
lives at his home with girlfriend of six years, her mother and 
daughter. He has one son who does not live with him, according to Levittown Patch.

Dr Ketunuti, 35, was found in the basement of her home on Monday afternoon by her dog walker.

Police said she was still smoldering when they arrived and the rope was still around her neck.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Victim: Melissa Ketunuti, who worked at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, was only 35 when she was hog tied, strangled and set on fire

Home: Police searched Smith's house on Wednesday night and took away his car for investigation

Evidence: Police believe there is crucial evidence in the silver truck belonging to the 'person of interest' which they have taken away as part of the investigation

Remains: Police officers carry the charred body of Melissa Ketunuti from her home to the police van so it can be taken to the coroner's office for an autopsy

Crime Scene investigators examined a silver Ford truck that police 
sources say was caught on several surveillance cameras around the 
victim's home at the time.

This and other footage of Jason Smith following the victim home and then walking around the area after the attack led police to taking him into custody.

Police narrowed down the time of her killing to between 10.50am - when she returned home after running a few errands - and 11.50am.

Smith's mother and girlfriend - who he lives with - are being questioned and said to be cooperating with police.

Neighbor Meghan Fenstermaker said: 'It's crazy because...he's outside always playing with his children. I mean, he doesn't seem like that kind of guy'

Melissa Ketunuti had been a pediatrician for five years before her gruesome murder in Philadelphia

Capt James Clark said of Melissa: 'She dedicated her whole life to being a
doctor and helping kids with cancer. It's very, very unfortunate that 
she died in this manner.'

He said Smith had nothing more than traffic offenses on his record and noted that he and Ketunuti had never met before, and Monday was the first time Smith had been at the home.

Melissa's dog walker and her doctor boyfriend - who lives in New York - were cleared as suspects and police do not know how - or if - the doctor and exterminator know each other.

According to Philly.com, members of the Homicide Task Force collected surveillance from a 
coffee shop, drug store and hospital overlooking where the doctor lived on Tuesday, and also removed more evidence from the house.

Smith's silver truck has been taken away which police believe contains crucial evidence.

Captain James Clarke said in a press conference today: 'An argument ensued between them, he struck her, she fell to the ground and he started to strangle her with a rope and set her alight'

Chief Inspector Scott Small said: 'Fire department puts out the fire and pronounces her dead. At this time we don't know the cause of death'

Melissa
Ketunuti, 35, lived alone with her dog in the quiet, residential area of 
Philadelphia. Firefighters responded to the call around 12.30pm and 
discovered the bound body in her basement.

Authorities say she was fully clothed and there were no signs of sexual assault.

There were no signs of forced entry and nothing was taken which led police to believe she knew her murderer.

Mellisa worked at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and was an avid blogger.

The hospital revealed today she was a second year infectious diseases fellow and researcher at CHOP.

'Melissa
was a warm, caring, earnest, bright young woman with her whole future 
ahead of her,' said Paul Offit, MD, chief of the Division of Infectious 
Diseases, in a written statement.

'But
more than that, she was admired, respected and loved by those with whom
she worked here at CHOP. Her death will have a profound impact on those
who worked with her and we will all miss her deeply.'

Pet: Melissa's body was found by her dog walker and friends say she lived for the pit bull/lab mix named Pooch and would often be seen walking him around the area

Learned: Melissa earned a doctorate in medicine from Stanford University and had initially considered working as a surgeon internationally. She was a pediatrician in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia

Her blog revealed she was an avid traveller - her mother is Belgian and her father Thai - and liked to go hiking and running in her free time.

According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, she earned a doctorate in medicine from Stanford University and had initially considered working as a surgeon internationally.

In the summer of 2005, she worked on an AIDS research fellowship in Botswana through the National Institutes of Health. She also completed internships at Johns Hopkins Hospital and New York University.

Neighbours were stunned at the grisly discovery and though most did not know her well, they said she seemed pleasant and had lived there about three years with her dog.
