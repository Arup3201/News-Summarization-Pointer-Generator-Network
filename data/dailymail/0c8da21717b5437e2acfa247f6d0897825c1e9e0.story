A man has been arrested in connection with the death of Sasha Marsden, the 16-year-old who was found knifed to death in a back alley in Blackpool..

David Minto, 22, of Blackpool, has been charged with murder and has been remanded into custody to appear before Blackpool Magistrates Court tomorrow morning.

The Crown Prosecution Service authorised Lancashire Constabulary to charge a man with the murder earlier today.

The body of Sasha was found in a back alley in the South Shore area of the town on Thursday.

Detectives are investigating whether  Sasha Marsden was in contact with her killer via Facebook and text

A spokesman for Lancashire 
Constabulary said: 'Tonight, the Crown Prosecution Service has 
authorised Lancashire Constabulary to charge a man with the murder of 
Sasha Marsden.

'David Minto, 22, of Kirby Road, 
Blackpool has been charged with murder and has been remanded into 
custody to appear before Blackpool Magistrates' Court tomorrow morning.

'The family have been informed of the latest development and specially trained officers continue to offer them support.'

Sasha Marsden was discovered with 'significant stab wounds' in an alley behind a bed and breakfast in Blackpool, Lancashire, on Thursday night.

She had been repeatedly stabbed in the head and face and wrapped in a carpet before attempts were made to set her body on fire.

Detectives are investigating whether a 
16-year-old killed in a frenzied stabbing attack exchanged Facebook 
messages with her killer.

They are 
investigating whether child care student Sasha was lured to her death by
 a false promise of weekend work to help fund her studies over Facebook or text. 

Her family have today paid tribute to their 'gorgeous little lady', whose death has left a gap that 'can never be filled'.

The family of the college student paid tribute to the 'gorgeous little lady' who was described as 'fun loving'

In a statement, Sasha's parents Gary,
 40, and Jayne, 45, from Staining, Blackpool, said: 'No words can 
express how we feel. Our beautiful daughter has been taken from us.

'She was a loving daughter, sister, granddaughter, great granddaughter, auntie, niece, cousin and girlfriend.

'She was very much loved and her loss has left a huge gap in all our lives, a gap that can never be filled.

'Sasha
 was your typical teenager, a fun-loving girl who enjoyed spending time 
with her friends and boyfriend, with her parents being last on the list 
unless she wanted something or needed a lift somewhere.

'We would ask that we be left alone in private to allow us to come to terms with losing our beautiful precious daughter.'

Her
 four siblings also gave heartfelt tributes to their sister who was 
studying childcare at the Blackpool and The Fylde College.

Her brother, Mark Brett, 24, said: 'She was my little sister and I was so proud of her going to college to do her child care course. She will be missed by all her family and friends.'

Sister Katie Brett, 21, said: 'She is
 a gorgeous little lady and knows how to make an impression and when you
 meet her, you would never forget her.

'She was an expert wind-up 
merchant and although you might be annoyed with her, you couldn't stay 
mad with her for long.'

Detective Superintendent Andy Murphy said a large police team was working on the case

Another
 sister, Gemma Aitchison, 26, said: 'Cheeky, friendly and stubborn are 
all things that make Sasha as special as she is and make her overcome 
anything. She is a beautiful sister and a wonderful and caring aunty 
too.'

Brother, Thomas 
Nicholl, 21, said: 'Sasha was an adorable little sister and was never 
afraid to put her opinions across no matter what the situation was.

'She
 always knew how to make us smile, especially after winding us up. She 
gave the most amazing cuddles and we will miss her so much.'

Sasha was a keen dancer who worked in
 a children's nursery at Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

Passers-by were reported to have thought the body was a shop dummy that was burning in Kirby Road in the resort's South Shore area.

The murder suspect and a 20-year-old woman were arrested close to the scene of the brutal attack and shortly after the discovery was made.

The woman was later released without charge.

A police spokesman previously said: ‘Following the death of Sasha Marsden, a Home Office post-mortem examination has been carried out and has found that Sasha died as a result of receiving significant stab wounds to the head and face.

‘It also showed that attempts were made to set the body on fire and this was after Sasha had died.'

Carl Evans, 35, owner of the Kimber 
House Hotel who found the body at about 9.15pm said: 'The first thing I knew something 
was wrong was when the fire or smoke alarm went off next door.

'The
 alarm was raised a short time later when one of our other neighbours 
was out walking his dog and came across what turned out to be a burning 
body.

Over 6,000 people have paid tribute to Sasha on a special Facebook page set up in her memory.

In a tribute to her, Mandy Pritchard, head of the college's school for society, health and childhood, said she was 'a friendly, considerate individual who cared about her fellow students'.

In a website for jobseekers Sasha submitted her CV and said: 'I am a hard working and honest person, I love a challenge and can apply myself to a range of jobs.

'I have a strong sense of responsibility and I'm happy to work on my own or with a team. I consider myself to be very organised and punctual and to be very good with customers and the public.'
