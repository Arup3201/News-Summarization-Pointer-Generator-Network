Former editor Andy Coulson was sentenced to 18 months in prison at the Old Bailey for phone hacking

Andy Coulson plans to ‘make the best’ of his prison sentence for phone hacking by teaching fellow inmates how to read and write.

The former director of communications for David Cameron, who was sentenced to 18 months on Friday for his part in the hacking conspiracy during his time as editor of News of the World, would also like to join the Samaritans.

Coulson’s plans for inmate-to-inmate mentoring  were revealed yesterday by former Tory Cabinet Minister Jonathan Aitken, who received an 18-month sentence for perjury in 1999.

In an open letter to Coulson, Aitken said: ‘A few hours before your sentencing, you told me that you were “determined to make the best of prison”… You were interested in becoming a “listener” (prison Samaritans), or working for the Shannon Trust’s Toe By Toe programme, which enables young illiterate offenders to be taught reading and writing skills by other prisoners (just the job for an ex-editor!).’

Aitken added that Coulson’s enthusiasm ‘speaks volumes for the positive way you are facing your sentence with humility and realism’.

Coulson, 46, was one of four ex-journalists at the tabloid to be sentenced on Friday, along with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire.

Five others, including former News International chief Rebekah Brooks, were cleared  of all charges late last month.
