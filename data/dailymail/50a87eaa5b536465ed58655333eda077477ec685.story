A video shows the incredible moment rescue crews descended from the roof of a hotel to save two window cleaners after the scaffold they had been working on broke loose.

The two men had been clinging to the platform, which was dangling at a sharp angle 70 meters above the ground, for nearly an hour before firefighters were able to lower them to safety.

They had been cleaning windows at the Crowne Plaza hotel in the Chilean capital of Santiago, and were on level with the 21st floor   when one of the cables holding their platform suddenly snapped.

Horrified onlookers watched as one of the washers hung onto a harness while the other clung desperately to the scaffold which was hanging almost vertically.

Firefighters received the emergency call and three crews were dispatched to the scene.

According to local media, firefighters decided to lower rescuers from the roof of the building when they realized there was no way a ladder would reach to the 21st floor.

Both washers escaped the ordeal unharmed, but were taken to a nearby medical clinic as a standard procedure.

Officials are still trying to determine what went wrong and will investigate whether the platform had been secured properly.

A similar incident occurred in New York earlier this month when two window washers were left dangling outside the 69th floor of One World Trade Center when their scaffold broke.

The two men were trapped for 90 minutes before members of the Fire Department of New York managed to rescue them by breaking through a panel of glass on the 68th floor and pull them in to safety.
