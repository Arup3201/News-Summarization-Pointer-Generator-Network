Eidur Gudjohnsen will play for Bolton Under 21s against Middlesbrough on Monday evening as he closes in on a sensational return to the Macron Stadium.

The 36-year-old has been training with Bolton since leaving Club Brugge in November and is currently a free agent. 

Gudjohnsen is expected to sign a short-term deal with Neil Lennon's side as long as he comes through Monday's game at the County Ground in Leyland.

The Icelandic striker signed for Chelsea from Bolton 14 years ago after playing at the Reebok Stadium (as it was known then) between 1998 and 2000.

Gudjohnsen has been training with the Championship side to maintain fitness but it now seems the frontman may have done enough to earn a permanent switch.

The 36-year-old scored 26 goals in his two seasons at Bolton, before six fruitful years at Stamford Bridge.

He then went to Barcelona, winning the Champions League in 2009, before going on a journey via Monaco, Tottenham, Stoke, Fulham, AEK Athens and Cercle Brugge.
