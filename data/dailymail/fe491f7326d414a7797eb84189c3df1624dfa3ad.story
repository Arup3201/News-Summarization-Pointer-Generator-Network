A Chinese school boy spent two hours sitting on a narrow ledge beneath his bedroom window after he tried to avoid punishment from his mother when he refused to do his homework.

Xiao Kai climbed out the window of his family apartment building on the 11th floor ledge in Yibin city in Sichuan in Southwest China after he had an argument with his mother on Monday morning.

The 12-year-old boy refused to do his homework before the Mid-Autumn Festival celebrations and wanted to sleep in longer as he had no school that day.

A representative from the property management residential committee, known as Yang said the boy was afraid of his mother, according to Global Times.

'We told him she was not right to beat a juvenile and police will take his mother away for questioning,' Yang said.

'Xiao Kai is a good yet introverted student. He was tired of suffering beatings from his mother.'

Police later took the mother into custody, according to Global Times.
