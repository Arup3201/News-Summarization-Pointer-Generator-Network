Lewis Hamilton has continued to make the most of his time away from the track by attending the Louis Vuitton Menswear Fall/Winter 2015-2016 show in Paris on Thursday.

The 30-year-old, reigning Formula One champion, was dressed to impress in a navy suit and shiny shoes while sporting his new hairstyle.

The 2014 BBC Sports Personality of the Year winner was sporting an even more daring look at the IWC 'Journey To The Stars' Gala Dinner on Tuesday.
