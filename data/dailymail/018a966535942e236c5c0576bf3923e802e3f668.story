A taxi company which offered white drivers on demand to customers after two of Pakistani origin were jailed for sexual grooming has decided to pull the service after its Asian drivers went on strike.

Minicab firm Car 2000, in Heywood in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, has reversed its decision to offer white or 'local' drivers on demand after all of its 55 Asian drivers walked out over the 'racist and discriminatory' decision.

Company boss Stephen Campbell, 34, said he had now told the firm's operators to no longer offer the 'on request' service and said he would be meeting with those on strike in an attempt to iron out the issues.

He said he made the decision to pull the service after learning of the taxi drivers' large protest in the town centre last night.

He said: 'The drivers were all aware we did this and said they wouldn't want to pick up a customer that didn't want them as a driver.

'But, as soon as they raised this as a problem, I have immediately changed it and have done what they wanted.'

In 2011, Mr Campbell's family took over the business, which was formerly called Eagle Taxis and which employed two of the nine men who were jailed a year later for grooming girls.

Mr Campbell previously said that, out of 12,000 calls a week, around 60 would request a 'local' driver in the wake of the Rochdale sex abuse scandal.

He said: 'Our operators have now been told that no one can do that again.'

Mr Campbell said on one occasion  one of his Asian drivers had been to pick up a customer who refused to get in his car, which left the employee upset.

He added: 'I don't operate a company that makes people feel bad. I was trying to protect them. But I suppose in protecting them I was contributing to people's racist beliefs.'

Mr Campbell, who employs a total of 80 drivers at Car 2000, said all his 55 Asian drivers were on strike today over the row.

He is set to meet with some of them this afternoon to iron out the problems in a bid to get them back to work.

The on-strike drivers  gathered in the centre of Heywood last night to protest about the firm offering white drivers on demand - blasting the service as 'racist' and 'discriminatory'.

They said they were concerned the policy would reinforce negative stereotypes in the town and described how their cars had regularly been attacked following the grooming scandal.

One driver, Abdul Hafiz, said: 'There were some bad men who worked as taxi drivers in Heywood and now they are in prison.

'We have done nothing wrong but now we are being treated like paedophiles.'
