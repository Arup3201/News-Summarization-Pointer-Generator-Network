Authorities say a child's body found off a highway in central Massachusetts on Friday matches the height and weight of a missing 5-year-old boy who has been missing for seven months.

Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said the body has not been positively identified as Jeremiah Oliver, of Fitchburg, and that won't happen until after an autopsy by the state medical examiner.

'It appears to be a homicide,' he said at a news conference.

Found dead: A body recovered near a wooded area in Massachusetts on Friday morning is believed to be missing five-year-old Fitchburg boy Jeremiah Oliver.

Tests: Massachusetts State Police stand along Interstate 190 where police said a child's body was found near Sterling

Early said the body was found at about 9 a.m. by a police search team about 40 feet off U.S. Highway 190 near Sterling, which is about 12 miles from Fitchburg. He said it was wrapped in blanket-like material, and packed in material that resembled a suitcase.

He would not say what led authorities to the location, or how long the body may have been there. He said the site is near an area that is regularly mowed on the side of the highway but would not have been visible to passing cars.

Jeremiah was last seen by relatives in September but wasn't reported missing until December. Authorities have said they feared he was dead.

The family was being monitored by state social workers at the time, and the case led to scrutiny of the state Department of Children and families.

Jeremiah's mother, Elsa Oliver, pleaded not guilty in March to charges including kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and reckless endangerment. Her boyfriend pleaded not guilty to similar charges. They have been held since December on lesser charges in the case.

The heartbreaking tale has been months in the making, as Jeremiah was reported missing in December when his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused.

Unusual behavior: Elsa Oliver, seen here in December, began acting strangely and refused to speak to even her own lawyer

Emotionless: Elsa Oliver reportedly spoke to a relative recently and randomly interjected asking 'Is it the Rapture?'

The girl said that the last time they saw Jeremiah- which is said to be on September 14- his hand was bleeding and for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound.

Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December.

Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

During the initial investigation a strange clue was offered when it was found that Elsa had a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it.

Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant.

Missing: The search had been going on since December although young Jeremiah Oliver has not been seen since September

It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse.

The source said Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion.
