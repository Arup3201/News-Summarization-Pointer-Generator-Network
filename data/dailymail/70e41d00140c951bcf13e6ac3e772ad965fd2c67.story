Fraud: Nebil Jouini, who preyed on a 67-year-old woman from Cardiff who he met on holiday and stole from her

A Tunisian man stole from a British woman and 'ate her out of house and home' after he took up her casual offer to stay with her if he ever visited Wales.

Nebil Jouini, 28, stole from the 67-year-old 'decent and generously minded' woman after going to stay at her Cardiff home.

The pair met at a hotel in Tunisia when the woman was on holiday, and she invited him to stay if he was ever visiting Wales.

But Cardiff Crown Court heard that after taking up the offer,  Jouini 'preyed' on the victim's good nature and stole from her.

Yesterday he was jailed for nine months after admitting fraud and theft offences - however, he will be allowed to stay in Britain after he is released from prison.

The court was told that the woman regularly went to Tunisia on holiday and met Jouini during a visit in September 2013.

She said that the pair became friends and at end the end of her holiday, she told him if he was ever in Cardiff, he should contact her.

Just a few weeks later, on October 13, he called her saying he was looking for work in Cardiff and asked if he could stay with her.

She said he could stay for two night, and he arrived on October 17 - but Jouini promptly asked to stay for the long term, claiming he would contribute to the cost of household bills.

The woman refused his request, but allowed him to stay for a few more days - only to discover that Jouini was going through her belongings while she went out to work every day.

She said while staying at her address he also 'ate her out of house and home'.

Prosecutor Gareth Jones said she 'wasn't happy with the excuses provided' and told him he was no longer welcome at her home.

He became abusive and threatening, telling her if she ever returned to Tunisia, he would get his cousin to kill her.

'She didn't take the threats seriously but was concerned,' said Mr Jones.

When she threatened to call the police, he packed his belongings and left. She was then contacted by her bank, reporting fraudulent activity on her credit card.

When she checked her card statement, she found Jouini had booked a £744 holiday in his own name, a flight for £175 and a hotel room in Bracknell, where  his estranged wife lives.

The victim also discovered he had stolen her bank book, mobile phone and a gold bracelet.

Kevin Seal, defending, said while his client was in custody awaiting sentence, he had been interviewed by immigration officials. They say no deportation proceedings will follow and he can return to his wife in the UK.

Judge Stephen Hopkins said that the whole basis of Jouini's visit to Cardiff was 'a sham' and ordered him to serve nine months in prison.

In an interview with a probation officer, Jouini said that he understood the woman would have been unhappy with what he had done to her.

But the judge said he believed Jouini was more concerned with his own problems, adding: 'You seem to find it difficult to understand the effect your behaviour had upon on this lady.'
