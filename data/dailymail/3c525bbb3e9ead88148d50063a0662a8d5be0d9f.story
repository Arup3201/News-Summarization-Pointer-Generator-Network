Challenger: Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to contest the rules, which prevent a foreign-born citizen from holding the nation's top job

Action star Arnold Schwarzenegger is lobbying for support to change the law to allow him to join the race for the White House in 2016.

The former governor of California, who was born in Austria, is said to be ready to file the paperwork needed to challenge the rules, which prevents a foreign-born citizen from holding the nation's top job.

However, any amendment to the Constitution must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate.

A source told Page Six the Terminator star has been talking openly about his political ambitions while he is in New York to promote his new film with Sylvester Stallone, Escape Plan.

The source said: 'Schwarzenegger has been talking openly 
about working on getting the constitutional rules changed so he can run 
for president in 2016.

'He is ready to file legal paperwork to challenge 
the rules.'

The 66-year-old, who became a US citizen in 1983, has previously declared interest in running for President, were the rules to be changed.

In 2010 he appeared on the 'Tonight Show', and when asked by host Jay Leno if he would make a White House run, if the rules were altered, the star replied: 'Without any doubt.'

And in 2008 he told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley he would 'absolutely' like to be US President.

'I think that I am always a person that looks for the next big goal,' he said. 'And I love challenges.

'I always set goals that are so high, that are almost impossible to achieve.

'Because then, you're always hungry for climbing and climbing. Because it's always interesting.

'The climb is always interesting. When you get there you just have to pick another goal.'

Columbia University Law School 
professor Michael Dorf, an expert in constitutional law, said about the former Governor's case in 2007: 'The law is very clear, but itâ€™s not 100 
percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave 
it to the political process.'

New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg has previously joked about forming a presidential ticket with Schwarzenegger.

A few years ago he said: 'There
 would be a fight to see who would be the presidential candidate and who
 would be the vice presidential candidate.

'He would want to arm-wrestle for the top spot; I would want
 to check the Constitution.'

Schwarzenegger's spokespeople failed to respond to requests for a comment from Page Six.
