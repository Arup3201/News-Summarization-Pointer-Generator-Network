A homeless man who earned widespread admiration after handing in $850 he found to the police has been denied benefits because he failed to report the windfall.

James Brady, 59, found the cash on Main Street in Hackensack, New Jersey last spring and turned it in to police.

This selfless deed was reported nationally and made Brady something of a minor celebrity in his hometown.

Honest: Formerly homeless James Brady was commended for turning in $850 he found, but denied benefits because he failed to report the 'income'

In October, police returned the money to Brady because no one had claimed it. This was when his problems began.

Brady has been denied General Assistance and Medicaid benefits by the Hackensack Human Services Department until December because he failed to report that he received the money.

'This is stupid,' Brady told the Record.

'I had already proven my honesty by turning in the $850. They were treating me like I was a dishonest individual, like I was trying to cheat them out of the money.'

Brady was homeless at the time he found the money after years of depression and unemployment.

After handing in the money to police because 'he didn't want to take money from anyone who could be worse off' that himself, things began to turn around for Brady.

According to the Record, he began receiving psychiatric help and was placed on medication that helped him get back on track.

He received praise from well-wishers and a commendation from the City Council, and moved into an apartment with a county housing voucher that paid for all but $5 of his $1,095.

But Brady recently had a meeting with Human Services director Agatha Toomey who had a print-out of a news story about Brady's good deed and subsequent windfall.

Toomey asked Brady how he had spent the $850. He told her he had bought napkins, toilet paper, a bathmat and a sandwich.

He then received a letter informing him that his $210 per month and his Medicaid had been cut off from 18 October until 31 December.

'I’m sorry but we had to - I had to - follow regulations,' Toomey told the Record. 'He only pays five dollars [a month] in rent.'

Brady's descent into homelessness began after the September 11 terrorist attacks in Manhattan.

He had worked as a news photographer before becoming a market data analyst.

He lost his job due to a merger and was looking for work in 2001. He had been due to attend a finance and technology exposition at the World Trade Center on September 11 but canceled.

Brady was left traumatized by the knowledge he could have been killed in the attacks and sank into depression, using up his savings and retirement fund until he ws evicted from him apartment and became homeless.

Of benefit: Brady receives $210 per month as well as medical benefits, both of which have been halted

Local councilors have expressed disappointment in the way Toomey has interpreted her duties.

'I think it’s very narrowly interpreted for someone to deny this kind of person,' said Councilwoman Rose Greenman

Gordon Johnson, a state assemblyman who represents Hackensack, told the Record: 'That’s a bit much to ask a homeless person who has a windfall of $800 - which is not really a windfall for his limited income.

'Where is the compassion in this?'

Brady told the Record that he has an appointment with Legal Services next week and is hoping someone can help him restore his benefits. He has dental work that needs to be carried out urgently and also needs to maintain his psychiatric care, both of which are insurmountable without his Medicaid.

Brady, who says he didn't even know how to go about reporting the $850, hopes the department will show more compassion towards people in need.

'They don't seem to want to help people,' he said.
