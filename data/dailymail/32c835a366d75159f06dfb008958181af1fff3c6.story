They are one of the world's most fearsome predators, with strong jaws and a muscular build weighing as much as 40 stone. 

But this has not deterred Frikkie Von Solms from raising a lion as a pet - and the pair have grown so close they have even shared the same bed. 

Mr Von Solms has reared 11-year-old Zion since birth and they regularly ride in his truck together. 

Zion was born to his mother, Simba, in captivity, but was removed from her care after fears the cub's father would kill him.

69-year-old Frikkie Von Solms has cared for 11-year-old Zion since birth and the pair have developed an inseparable bond 

Mr Von Solms walks barefoot next to the lion as Zion does not like noise - he described the lion as 'special because of the bond we share'

Mr Von Solms has grown very close to the lion and they have even shared the same bed and travel in his truck together

It was left to 69-year-old Mr Von Solms to care for the lion cub. 

Unable to return to the wild because of his tame and friendly nature, Zion lives with 18 other lions, as well as cheetahs and leopards, all looked after by Mr Von Solms. 

Eleven years later and the bond between Mr Von Solms and the 'king of the jungle' is stronger than ever. 

He spends his time walking Zion along dusty tracks in Africa - affectionately holding on to his tail - and drives the big cat to and from hunts in the back of his truck. 

To appease Zion - who dislikes noise - Mr Von Solms makes sure to walk barefoot next to the lion. 

Mr Von Solms, who wished to keep his location secret, said: 'Since Zion, I have raised nineteen lions, and leopards and cheetahs. 

'But he is special because of the bond we share. I learnt so much from him. 

'It was a once in a lifetime experience to grow up with him and learn and live with him through all of the stages of being a lion.

'People talk about lions like they are just lions but they have personalities, they have humour and laugh.

'Zion is a gentle giant. He has never attacked humans and I trust him completely.'

The cub needed constant feeding every four hours - here Mr Von Solms is seen training and playing with Zion as a cub

He described Zion as a 'gentle giant' and said 'people talk about lions like they are just lions but they have personalities, they have humour'
