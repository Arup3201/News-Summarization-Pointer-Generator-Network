The Duchess of Cambridge was flying the flag last night at a glitzy cocktail bash to promote the best of Britain.

Elegant Kate, who was without her husband, Prince William, was attending a Creative Industries reception at the Royal Academy of Arts in London’s Piccadilly to support the Government’s GREAT Campaign.

Wearing a dove grey dress by designer Roksanda Ilincic, Serbian born but a graduate of Central St Martin's, the Duchess swept down the red carpet prompting a battery of camera flashes.

Polished: The Duchess of Cambridge wore an elegant pale grey dress, and a sleek chignon up-do for a Creative Industries reception at the Royal Academy of Arts this evening

She first sported the designer 
outfit, which has an unusual slashed neckline, when she arrived in LA 
last year on her inaugural royal tour.

She was greeted by the Prime Minister David Cameron, the first time the two have apparently been photographed together.

The Duchess completed her outfit with a pair of the palest pale grey 
suede heels, tan tights and hooped Kiki McDonough earrings.

Unusually she
 wore her hair swept back in an elegant chignon showing off her new 
earrings, which she also wore to the Olympic Games opening ceremony on 
Friday, to their best advantage.

Opening the event, the Prime Minister David Cameron made a short speech 
and revealed a fascinating conversation he enjoyed with Prince William 
at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games with Prince William.

Turning to the Duchess, he said: 'My favourite part of the opening 
ceremony was when your husband leant over and said to me 'I don't know 
if you know, Prime Minister, but my grandmother is a great fan of Dizzee 
Rascal.'

The comment prompted howls of laughter, not least from the Duchess.

Aides said they were confident that the prince made the quip - but less sure as to whether it was true.

Dizzee Rascal is a London-born rapper famed for his high voltage hits 
such as Bonkers and while the Queen is known to have diverse tastes, it 
would certainly be an unusual choice for her iPod.

The star-studded bash was thrown by The Founders Forum to celebrate UK 
culture, creativity, art and entertainment on the back of the GREAT 
initiative, which is itself designed to showcase Britain’s capabilities 
and to promote our economic potential abroad on the back of both the 
Diamond Jubilee and Olympic Games.

Some 800 people, including representatives of the UK’s leading creative 
companies, industry figureheads, as well as guests from overseas 
businesses and organisations interested in investing in or buying 
creative services from the UK, attended the event.

Among them were a host of famous names including model Lily Cole, Fearne Cotton, Sir Terence Conran and Roger Daltry.

Several of the cast of Downton Abbey, dancer Arlene Phillips and singer Lulu also joined the crowd.

Dressed to impress: Former Pussycat Doll Kimberley Wyatt (left), Kiwi singer Hayley Westenra (centre) and MP Tessa Jowell (right) were among the unlikely names to rub shoulders at the reception

Dapper: Radio host Nick Grimshaw and fashion designer Henry Holland were also present at the RA last night

Miss Phillips said: 'We have so much to be proud of in this country, so 
much to offer. We have the best arts, best dance, best music, I just 
want to shout it from the rooftops.

Repeat performance: Kate has worn the dress once before, when she arrived in Los Angeles on her tour of North America in July last year

'And what I really want is to see Kate and William dancing. We all know 
that Harry has got the moves, he has showed us those! Those hips don't 
lie! But I would love to see William and Kate take a spin round 
together.'

As well as the Prime Minister  there were speeches from Christopher Le 
Brun, President of The Royal Academy, and Jonathan Goodwin, co-founder 
of The Founders Forum and founder of Lepe Partners.

The Founders Forum was set up by Goodwin and Brent Hoberman of 
lastminute.com as a community for the best global entrepreneurs in the 
areas of media and technology.

The organisation brings together more than 1,000 of the world’s most 
dynamic businessmen and women for brainstorming sessions as well as 
talent-spotting candidates to showcase their new ideas to founders, 
investors, journalists and future entrepreneurs.

Kate has no formal role with the organisation but was persuaded to 
attend by UKTI, the Government’s trade body, in order to ‘fly the flag 
for Britain’.

‘Although the Duchess doesn’t have or plan to have a formal role with 
UKTI, she was very much involved in their work when she and the Duke 
visited LA last year, as was Prince Harry when he went to Brazil,’ a 
spokesman said.

‘She is very happy to do what she can to promote UK PLC.’

Afterwards the Duchess mingled for around half an hour, chatting to 
guests including designer Stella McCartney and Apple inventor Sir 
Jonathan Ive, designer of the iPhone and iPad.

Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said afterwards: 'I was just watching the 
men's gymnastics in front of Prince Harry and Prince William so I've 
gone from the Duke to the Duchess.

'What the royal family are brilliant at doing is showing we have the traditions but also we embrace the future.

'And there's something about Prince William and the Duchess that is so 
about the future and an exciting future for us as a country and 
obviously the creative industries we're celebrating tonight are part of 
that.'
