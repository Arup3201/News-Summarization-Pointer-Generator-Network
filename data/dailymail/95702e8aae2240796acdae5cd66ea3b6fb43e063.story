The people at KFC have revolutionized the take out container by making one that fits inside your car’s cup holder.

The KFC Go Cup comes with a choice of five combinations of the restaurant’s popular chicken treats, all with a side of potato wedges.

KFC says the idea for the ingenious containers came when research showed that people are largely using their cup holders for things other than drinks.

World changing: KFC has introduced the Go Cup, a take-out box with with a choice of five combinations of chicken and side that fits in your car's cup holder

According to KFC, only 33 percent of Americans use the holders for drinks, while 75 percent fill the cup holders with at least something.

Those not putting drinks inside are  filling the void instead with loose change, phones and electronics, or just trash.

What’s more, the restaurant formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken found that 42 percent of Americans would be more likely to eat in their cars if their food container fit conveniently into their cup holder.

For millenials, KFC found that number jumps to 53 percent.

Steamy: KFC says it came up with the idea when research showed Americans use cup holders for lots of things besides drinks, including loos coins, phones, and even trash

Seeing an opportunity, KFC came up with Go Cups.

The customizable cups come with a piece of boneless Original Recipe chicken, chicken tenders, hot wings, Original Recipe bites, or even a mini chicken sandwich.

Alongside the main dish comes potato wedges.

The cup is built with dual compartments so no unwanted mixing occurs between potato and chicken.

The handy new cups also come with a price within reach to almost anyone. All five combos cost just $2.49
