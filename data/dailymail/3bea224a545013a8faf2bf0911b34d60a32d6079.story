An entrepreneur is hoping to make a tidy sum out of the tragedy of the Ebola outbreak by selling a domain using the virus' name for a six figure sum.

Jon Schultz, who monitors a number of 'disease domains' from his home in Las Vegas, bought Ebola.com in 2008 and now believes he can sell it for $150,000.

The businessman also owns birdflu.com and H1N1.com, as well a domain for the deadly mosquito-borne disease Chikungunya and another for the Ebola-like Marburg virus.

He paid $13,500 for his Ebola domain four years ago and has been waiting for the moment to sell.

The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa

'Ebola.com would be a great domain for a pharmaceutical company working on a vaccine or cure, a company selling pandemic or disaster-preparedness supplies, or a medical company wishing to provide information and advertise services,' Mr Schultz told CNBC in an emailed statement.

'There could be many other applications as well. With so many people concerned about the disease, any advertisement referring people to Ebola.com should get an excellent response.'

In an interview with the Washington Post, Mr Schultz said he felt that a six figure sum was more than reasonable for Ebola.com.

'According to our site meter, we're already doing 5,000 page views per day just by people typing in Ebola.com to see what's there,' he said.

'We're getting inquiries every day about the sale of it. I have a lot of experience in this sort of domain business, and my sense is that $150,000 is reasonable.'

Mr Schultz, who also owns terror.com, PotassiumIodide.com and fukushima.com, appeared untroubled about the issue of making money from a human tragedy.

The World Health Organization called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'

'But you could say the same thing about doctors,' Schultz told the Washington Post. 'They can become very well-off treating very sick patients. 

'Besides we have sacrificed a couple of thousands in parking page income to put up links about Ebola on the site. And people can also donate to Doctors Without Borders at the site.'

The hemorrhagic fever, which has no proven cure, has killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa since an outbreak that began in March.

The World Health Organization  called the outbreak 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times'. 

The risks of failing to contain Ebola in West Africa have come into sharp focus in the United States after the first patient diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil, Thomas Eric Duncan, died last week.

Erica Ollman Saphire, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus using 'crowdfunding' on the internet

Mr Schultz told the Washington Post he wants to sell the domain soon because he is worried something may 'ameliorate' the outbreak, diminishing Ebola's news value and the value of the domain.

'Ebola is either something that could become more of a problem, or it's something that could ameliorate and not be a big news story for that much longer,' he said.

But the entrepreneur still has other domain's to fall back on should Ebola.com lose its value.

'Our domain, birdflu.com, is worth way more than Ebola.com. We're definitely holding onto that one for the event,' he said, referring to an outbreak he believes could be far bigger than Ebola.

ZMappwas used to treat aid worker Dr. Kent Brantly (pictured). An appeal is hoping to raise money to speed up the research into the drugs

'That one's airborne and Ebola would never go airborne in the United States like bird flu can.'

In California, a different individual has also turned to the internet to raise money. But rather than capitalizing on the outbreak immunologist Erica Ollman Saphire is hoping to find a cure for the deadly virus.

The professor at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego is hoping that Internet 'crowdfunding' will help provide the extra money needed to speed up the research.

She is in charge of an international consortium developing the new anti-Ebola drugs that helped formulate the experimental ZMapp serum that used to treat two American aid workers who contracted Ebola in Liberia and recovered.

Dr. Saphire posted an appeal on the Crowd Rise website  seeking at least $100,000 in contributions for purchasing equipment that will allow researchers to more quickly analyze blood samples of antibodies from survivors of the hemorrhagic fever.

The appeal has so far raised nearly $17,500 in donations.

The Scripps-led consortium was established with a $28 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, but the rapidly growing scope of its work has placed additional demands on limited resources.

Specimens are being sent to Dr. Saphire's lab from around the world, 'but the number of samples outpaces the ability of her current equipment to process them', the website said in a message. 

ZMapp is a mix of three antibodies designed to bind to proteins of the Ebola virus, preventing it from replicating and triggering the immune response of infected cells.

The compound was tested in monkeys, but there were no human trials of the serum before it was rushed to Atlanta to treat U.S. aid workers Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol after they became infected in Liberia in July.

Both were ultimately cured, but doctors are unsure whether the ZMapp actually helped them.
