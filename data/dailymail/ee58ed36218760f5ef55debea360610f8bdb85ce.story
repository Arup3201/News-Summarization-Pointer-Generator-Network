A top London hotel has unveiled a luxury nursery suite fit for royalty after being inspired by the imminent arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's firstborn.

The Grosvenor House hotel - located on Park Lane opposite Hyde Park - has collaborated with bespoke royal
nursery designers Dragons of Walton Street to design the room, which has seen one of the luxury hotel's
Premium Park View suites transformed into a nursery, designed and tailored with a certain royal baby in mind.

Dragons of Walton 
Street has a historic association with the Royal family, with Princes 
William and Harry and their cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie all 
growing up in Dragons nurseries.

And now, we have been granted an exclusive video tour behind the closed doors of the hotel's take on a royal nursery just before it opens to the world.

The first central London luxury hotel nursery of its kind,
Grosvenor House's baby bedroom is called Suite Dreams, and aims 'to 
provide parents with a quintessentially British, unique home-from-home 
experience'.

The 
room, fit for a future king or queen, has been fitted with 1920s-style 
furnishings in keeping with the hotel's traditional bedroom suites for 
adults.

Dragons of Walton Street have created a beautiful selection of hand-crafted and hand-painted furniture,
with intricate illustrations representing elements of London's Hyde 
Park, the history of Grosvenor House and the Royal family.

Speaking in an exclusive video, Lucinda Croft, MD of Dragons of Walton Street, said: We have the copyright to handpaint Beatrix Potter artwork onto the walls, which we are very proud of. It is intrinsically British and timeless for a guest from overseas.

Speaking about the intricate drawings of the City on the table, she said: 'The idea is that if you took your toddler sightseeing you can say: "Look, look, that's where we went!"'

There will be three bespoke (and aptly named) packages available for the nursery: Buckingham, Windsor and Clarence.

The grand Buckingham package - a three-night stay starting from £6,270 - includes a range of luxurious pampering activities, from a complimentary cut and blow dry at Sanrizz for mothers, a men's shave at Alfred Dunhill for fathers, as well as a private consultation with the Dragons of Walton Street.

Lucinda added: 'It's got very lovely muted colours, which are very "in" at the moment.

'People aren't asking for bright primary colours, they want something that's quiet and peaceful, which apparently is due to the economic downturn.'

Lorna O'Neill, Communications 
Director at Grosvenor House said: 'Partnering with Dragons of Walton 
Street is quite simply the perfect fit for our Suite Dreams nursery, in 
light of our own royal patronage dating back to 1929. 

'The designs are exquisite, and to know they are just for Grosvenor House, with a royal baby in mind, is really exciting.

'Each
piece of furniture tells a story, and we're thrilled to be offering our
guests with young children a unique, memorable and royal experience 
that will live with them long after their stay with us, and of course be
celebrating the arrival of the Royal baby in this way.'

Lucinda
Croft added: 'We are absolutely thrilled to be working with Grosvenor 
House in creating this simply magical suite that will be fit for a 
future king or queen. 

'Both Dragons of Walton Street and 
Grosvenor House have impressive royal heritage, so it seemed completely 
natural to join together to celebrate the new arrival in this way.

'Going
away to a hotel with a new baby can be such a palaver, but every issue 
has been taken care of so visitors to London can arrive without a care 
in the world.'

Lucinda and her team have plenty of experience when it comes to designing nurseries and most famously kitted one out for Princess Diana.

Lucinda explained: 'My mother who started Dragons was so excited when we did Princess Diana's nursery and we didn't tell anybody, we just did it.

'Princess Diana came to the shop several times and she was just lovely. She lived locally so she would just pop in and Walton Street is one of those streets where you can get away with just slipping in.

'We have done things for other members of the Royal families, and Royal families across the world, which is really lovely and always a privilege.

'My mother did a special design for them, we've never told anyone the details but I just remember my mother's pride and joy and delight at doing it and Princess Diana was really pleased with it and loved it, which was really great.'

The Suite Dreams package will be available to pre-book from tomorrow, and officially open to the public from June.
