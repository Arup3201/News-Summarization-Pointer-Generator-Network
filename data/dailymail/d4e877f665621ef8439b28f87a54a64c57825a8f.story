A neighbour of Tia Sharp's grandmother  was today jailed for five months after being convicted of wasting police time by giving a false statement that he had seen her alive.

Paul Meehan, 40, who lived next door to Christine Bicknell and her murderer boyfriend Stuart Hazell, had told detectives investigating the schoolgirl's disappearance that he saw her walk past his home.

The bus driver told officers he was ‘100 per cent sure’ he saw her walk past the house in New Addington, south London, on August 3 last year - but the 12-year-old was already dead.

At Croydon Magistrates' Court, Meehan was convicted of ‘causing wasteful employment of the police by making a false report’.

Hazell was jailed in May for a minimum of 38 years for killing Tia, but the court heard there was no suggestion Meehan was in league with the murderer.

Meehan remained impassive as the verdict was delivered. However, as the hearing adjourned he sat down and buried his head in his hands.

The last confirmed sighting of Tia was on Thursday August 2 last year at 4.30pm. She was murdered at some point that night going into the following morning.

On Monday August 6 as the missing 12-year-old's family were frantic with worry, Meehan told police he had seen her walk past him the previous Friday while he was in his garden.

He gave a detailed and ‘vivid’ 
description of what she was wearing, the court heard, which delayed 
police from interviewing Hazell earlier.

'He wouldn’t be the first or last person to derive some
satisfaction, however subconsciously, of playing the role of the last person to
see the victim of a homicide alive'

Ledward, prosecuting

But
police had spoken to Meehan about the case three times before he 
finally said he saw her. He claimed that he ‘confabulated’ seeing her - 
his brain mistakenly filled in the blanks in good faith.

Jocelyn
Ledward, prosecuting, said Meehan had ‘deliberately lied’ possibly to 
put himself in an important position in what was then a missing persons 
inquiry.

She said: ‘He wouldn’t be the first or last person to derive some
satisfaction, however subconsciously, of playing the role of the last person to
see the victim of a homicide alive.’

Tragic case: The last confirmed sighting of Tia Sharp was on Thursday August 2 last year at 4.30pm. She was murdered at some point that night going into the following morning

She added that Meehan had texted his wife about his police
dealings and that there was a ‘hint of him being puffed up’ by
the focus being on him.

'You basked to some degree in the attention your disclosure brought you'

District Judge Karen Hammond

Meehan’s solicitor, David Healey, said his client - who has
one previous conviction for theft - has been suffering from depression since
his arrest.

He said there was no medical or psychological evidence of
him wanting the attention. District Judge Karen Hammond said Meehan was unreliable.

She said: ‘I am satisfied so that I am sure, that is to say, beyond reasonable doubt. The offence is made out. The verdict therefore can only be one of guilty.’

Jailing him for five months, she said: 'You basked to some degree in the attention your disclosure brought you.'
