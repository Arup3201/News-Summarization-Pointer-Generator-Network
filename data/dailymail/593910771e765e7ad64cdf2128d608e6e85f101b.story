A county executive who was caught following a teenage porn star on Twitter has blamed it on computer hackers.

Steve Bellone, the executive of Suffolk County, New York, included 19-year-old Miriam Weeks, better known as Belle Knox, on the list of 267 social media accounts he kept up to date with.

But when challenged about his taste in Twitter accounts this week, he immediately unfollowed the actress - who appears in explicit videos online and has hosted a porn-themed gameshow called The Sex Factor.

A spokesman for Bellone, who now follows 266 accounts, said that they had told police about the alleged hacking, and changed their protocols, the New York Post reported.

Knox, whose Twitter feed is devoted to plugging her explicit videos, rose to fame earlier this year when she was outed as a student at prestigious Duke University, North Carolina, by a classmate.

In the wake of her exposure, she defended her decision to pay her school fees with money from the sex industry - and now uses her college as a selling point.

She has recently appeared on the cover of Xtreme Magazine, and has also appeared in Hustler, Penthouse and Playboy.

Explicit: Knox, who was dramatically outed as a Duke University student this year, posts nude pictures and clips from her work on Twitter, which would have been visible on Bellone's feed

Her Twitter account routinely posts images from her appearances - which have not been censored - which would in turn appear on the news feed of followers such as Bellone.

Aside from Knox, Bellone, a married father of three, follows mainly political, media, sports and charity accounts. He is up for re-election in 2015.

When challenged by the post over the apparent error, a spokesman said: 'County Executive Bellone’s Twitter account, which is operated by his staff, has been hacked and an obscene Twitter account was subsequently followed.'

'A formal complaint has been filed with Twitter and to the third-party software used to assist in managing the account.'

Proud: Knox, who has used her notoriety as a selling point, has spoken at length about her sex work - and advocates the legalization of prostitution throughout the U.S.

Although mainly content to balance her majors in sociology and women's studies with her adult filming, Knox has made some political points of her own - calling for prostitution to be legalized.

In an opinion piece for Rolling Stone magazine last month, she called for a law chance, saying: 'The time has come for the world's oldest profession to be legalized in the so-called Land of the Free for public health, safety and opportunity.'

She argued that most sex workers join the trade out of choice, and should be allowed to practice it legally - as they can in some parts of Nevada - so it can be more safe and lucrative.
