A Texas woman believes she's seen the Lord in a bug's back.

Yvonne Esquiline found a moth clinging to her Texas home last week and pictured in brown and yellow on its body and wings she could make out the head of Jesus.

'At first it looked like Jesus,' said Esquiline. 'And I still think it looks like Jesus.'

Can you see it? A Texas woman says she can see Jesus in this Imperial moth, a large species nearly the size of a human hand

The Georgetown woman's conviction gets even more specific. She says the moth's colors indicate she's in for some good fortune.

Esquiline and her family believe the Imperial moth's brown coloration means represents important news and that the yellow splotches indicate home.

'I believe this was a sign,' Esquiline told KXAN. 'God is letting me know good news is coming and to keep the hope.'

Esquiline hopes it means she'll be able to pay for her daughter's education.

And she's not letting naysayers rattle her faith. At least not too much.

'People also saw an image of the Devil which is kind of creepy but after staring at it for so long it almost looks like it,' she admitted.

Esquiline said the moth, along with whatever was on its back, stuck around for a day before leaving to bring its good luck to another home. 

Or is it something else? 'People also saw an image of the Devil which is kind of creepy but after staring at it for so long it almost looks like it,' Esquiline admitted
