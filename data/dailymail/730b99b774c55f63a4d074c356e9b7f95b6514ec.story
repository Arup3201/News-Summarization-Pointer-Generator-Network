Price hike: The cost of a one-off prescription will rise to £7.85 from April 1st

Millions of patients will be left out of pocket as prescription charges in England rise by 20p next month.

The price-hike, which will come into force on April 1, will bring the cost of a one-off prescription to £7.85.

But although patients in England will be hit by the charge, those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will continue to pay nothing.

The prescription apartheid will mean thousands of English patients are forced to ‘choose’ which medication they can afford.

Health Minister Earl Howe defended the rise announced yesterday, saying it helped save the NHS billions.

He said patients needing more than one prescription a month were protected because the cost of a prescription pre-payment certificate - which allows people who have multiple prescriptions to pay a fixed cost over a period of three months or a year.

But organisations representing long-term sick patients said the system was ‘arbitrary, outdated and inequitable’.

Pharmacists also condemned the price increase, saying they had to watch poorer patients decide which prescriptions they needed most.

The cost of a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) will remain at £29.10 for a three month certificate.The annual cost will remain at £104.

PPCs offer savings for those needing four or more items in three months or 14 or more items in one year.

NHS dental charges will also increase on April 1 in England, with the charge for basic dental treatment rising 50p to £18.

The value of NHS optical vouchers goes up one per cent to help with the cost of spectacles and contact lenses.

Free prescriptions were introduced in Wales in 2007, Northern Ireland in 2010 and Scotland in 2011.

Patients exempt from charges in England include children under 16, income-related benefit claimants and pregnant women.

The charge for basic dental treatment will also rise 50p to £18

The Prescription Charges Coalition, which represents more than 20 organisations, is campaigning to end ‘unfair’ prescription charges for people with long term medical conditions.

David Barker, chief executive of Crohn’s and Colitis UK and spokesman for the Coalition, said millions of patients would be disappointed by the rise.

He said ‘As a group of charities and organisations representing millions of people with long-term conditions, we know that prescription charges are arbitrary, outdated and inequitable, given that the list of exemptions has hardly been updated since its introduction in the 1960s.

‘Prescription charges have risen every year since 1979, and the Minister must consider the impact this further increase will have on those who are already struggling to afford the essential medication required to keep them well.’

He said the Coalition would publish a report later this month showing how society was paying too great a price for prescription charges.

Joseph Clift, Policy Manager at the British Heart Foundation (BHF), said ‘Prescription charges in England should be free but instead people with heart disease are facing up to yet another increase. It’s an incredibly bitter pill to swallow.

‘A freeze on the cost of prescription 
prepayment certificates will offer some light relief but the growing 
financial burden of expensive prescription charges cannot be ignored.

‘People living with heart disease, or at risk of the disease, should be focusing on getting better and keeping well not worrying about how they’re going to pay for their next vital prescription.’ Rob Darracott, chief executive of Pharmacy Voice, which represents pharmacists, said ‘We are disappointed with the increase; prescription charges deter many people from getting medicines which their doctor prescribes.

‘Patients on low incomes who do not qualify for exemption suffer the most. Patients often have to make the decision of what medicine they can take based on their finances.

‘From a pharmacist’s point of view, processing prescription levies is part of the job that adds workload but no patient benefit. Pharmacists, like other health care professionals, experience great pressures on their time and any release of time could be used to enhance patient care.’

Health minister Lord Howe said ‘The Government is investing more than £12.5 billion of extra money in the NHS and we are on course to save £5 billion over this financial year, all of which will be re-directed into front-line care.

‘In England, around 90 per cent of prescription items are dispensed free. We have also frozen the price of prescription pre-payment certificates for a further year, benefiting those who need multiple items. This means anyone who needs 14 or more prescription items in a year can get all the prescriptions they need for an average cost of £2 per week. ‘
