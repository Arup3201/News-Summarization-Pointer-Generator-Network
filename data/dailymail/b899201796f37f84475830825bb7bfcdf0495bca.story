A British teenager who collapsed and died of severe hydration while hiking in an Australian national park has been named as 14-year-old Euan Williamson.

Euan, from Scotland, arrived in Australia two weeks ago to stay with his father, who lives in western Australia, for the Christmas holidays.

The pair set out to explore a walking track along the Badjirrajirra Creek in the Cape Range National Park, but as the temperature soared above 40c father and son found themselves in trouble.

Tragic: A teenage British boy on holiday in Australia has died of severe dehydration after collapsing while hiking with his father in a remote desert gorge in Cape Range National Park

Police said they had not taken enough water with them – and they had been unable to find sufficient shade.

When the teenager collapsed from dehydration his desperate 49-year-old father managed to make an emergency call on his mobile phone.

Police who rushed to the area from Exmouth, 15 miles to the north, found the father and his unconscious son about 700 yards down a gully.

Friends of Euan paid tribute to him on social networking site Twitter

Tributes have been paid to the teenager by his friends on Twitter. @RachhhK wrote, 'EuanWilliamson would say "hasta la vista baby, Euan has left the building" but I wish he hasn't of (sic) because Euan WAS and IS the best'.

@ewanhaighferry added 'rip euan williamson #gbnf (gone but never forgotten)', while @Killjoy_Heather said, 'RIP Euan Williamson. you were epic. gonna mis the banter :(.'

Police officers carried the boy to a car park where St John Ambulance paramedics, who had also sped to the area, performed CPR.

The teenager was then taken to Exmouth Hospital but despite the efforts of doctors he died several hours later.

Exmouthshire president Turk Shales said thermometers in town had hit 48C on Friday, and added he was shocked to hear something so devastating had happened near the town so close to Christmas.

'When a wind goes south to south-west, it goes to the top of the Cape and it fans - it's like a heater,' he said.

'It gets very, very hot. I'm just so sorry for them. My heartfelt condolences go out to the family.'Mr Shales said the terrain in the area was dangerous and 'extremely harsh'.

'The last three or four days in Exmouth have been extreme and it's only going to get worse before Christmas,' he said.

Even
Aborigines who have spent a lifetime in desert areas, living under a 
relentless sun, have perished while travelling between communities 
because of their failure to carry enough water with them.

The Cape Range National Park is described as having spectacular rugged limestone ranges and breathtaking deep canyons.

More than 700 caves are known to be in the national park, but it is believed many more remain undiscovered.

The
Exmouth Visitors’ Centre website warns: ‘Avoid walking in the middle of
the day and always carry water as there is almost no surface water in 
Cape Range.'

According to Bupa, there are thousands of deaths in Australia every year as a direct result of heatwaves.While heatstroke most commonly proves fatal in the elderly or infants, it most often strikes young, active people as a consequence of physical activity in high temperatures which can cause symptoms to develop rapidly.

Symptoms
include a high body temperature with heavy sweating that suddenly stops
as the body becomes dehydrated, along with a rapid heart beat and 
hyperventilation. Heatstroke can also affect the nervous system causing 
mental confusion, fits and loss of consciousness.

Searing temperatures can also cause fire - such as in the southern state of Victoria where bush blazes lead to the deaths of nearly 200 people. A further 700 died from heat stroke.

The Australian Climate Commission fears heat-related deaths will rise to more than 10,000 a year by the end of the century if global temperatures continue to rise.
