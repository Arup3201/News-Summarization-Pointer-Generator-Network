Gripping an aide's arm for support as he hobbles up a ramp, the world's most powerful man offers the rarest of glimpses into a secret he was desperate to hide.

To the world U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a pillar of strength and vitality; a robust leader who navigated America through two of the greatest crises of the 20th century - the Great Depression and World War Two.

But away from the cameras he was unable to walk more than a few yards without help. Even then each step seemed a punishing exertion, both physically and mentally, forcing him to spend most of his time confined to a wheelchair.

Rare footage: Filmed in 1937 in Harrisburg, PA, by Major 
League Baseball pitcher Jimmie DeShong, 
this is only the second piece of footage of the four-term president on 
his feet ever to be unearthed

He was so keen to keep his frailty hidden from the American public, that only one video has ever been released of him walking . . .  until now.

Filmed in 1937 in Harrisburg, PA, by Major League Baseball pitcher Jimmie DeShong, this is only the second piece of footage of the four-term president on his feet ever to be unearthed.

Punishing: But away from the cameras he was unable to walk more than a few yards without help. Even then each step seemed a punishing exertion, both physically and mentally

Revealed today by the
Pennsylvania State Archives, it was recorded 16 years after FDR 
was paralysed from the waist down by a bout of polio while holidaying 
with his family in Canada.

One of Franklin D. Roosevelt's greatest diplomatic masterstrokes was convincing Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin to pose for a picture together, sitting down.

By February 1945, FDR was suffering from a weak heart and was so frail he was barely able to stand.

Still he attended the Yalta Conference so he, Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin could discuss how to reorganise Europe after the Second World War.

The agreement they reached was instrumental to the partitioning of Germany and the inception of the United Nations.

But fearing he would look weak next to his robust British and Soviet counterparts if pictured sitting while they stood, he persuaded them both to take a seat for the final photo call.

The result was one of the most iconic political photographs of the 20th century.

That photo call - one of only two that included all three leaders - was the last Roosevelt would attend.

He looked pallid and frail as his health had already begun to fail him. He died two months later.

As a result he was unable to walk without leg braces or assistance.

During his four terms as president, Roosevelt often used a wheelchair in private, but not for public appearances.

News photographers cooperated in concealing Roosevelt's disability, and those who did not found their camera views blocked by Secret Service agents.

'In some instances, they confiscated cameras and film to protect his image,' said Jim Vaughn, Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. 'They worked really hard for people not to think of their president as paralyzed.'

'This was home movies,' DeShong's grandson, Mike Savastio, told ABC affiliate WHTM. 'We’d get together at my mom’s house and they would come over and put up a reel and we’d watch it in our living room.'

Filmmaker Ken Burns, who is using it in 
his upcoming documentary 'The Roosevelts: An Intimate History', said: 
'We were thrilled with the discovery of a new piece of film footage of 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt walking.

'Any film 
of him struggling to get from one place to another is extremely rare, as
 the Secret Service either prohibited or confiscated cameras whenever 
FDR was making an attempt to propel himself from his car to anywhere 
else.

'The President wanted to minimize the 
public's knowledge of the devastating effects polio had had on him.

'He 
was completely paralyzed from the waist down and he could not walk 
without the aid of a cane and braces on both legs.

'The press in those 
days complied with his request not to be filmed.'

Franklin D. Roosevelt died in April 1945, two months after the historic Yalta Conference in which he, Britain's Winston Churchill and Soviet leader Josef Stalin agreed a plan for Europe's reorganisation following the end of the Second World War.

Close allies: While the meeting of the 'Big Three' happened only twice, FDR and Churchill became close allies, convening on 11 separate occasions. Never once, were they photographed standing up

He looked pallid and frail as his health had already begun to fail him.

In fact, unbeknownst to the world, he had
 been in declining health already for five years, having been diagnosed 
with high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease 
causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure.

Nevertheless,
 he refused to give in to his ailing body, and may even have used his 
authority over the Office of Censorship to suppress news reports on his 
declining health before the 1944 election that won him a fourth term in 
office.
