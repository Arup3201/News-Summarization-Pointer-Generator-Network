A group of adventurous kayakers recently filmed their day out exploring an abandoned steam-engine boat lay to waste in the Ohio River.

James Malott and his friends found the 112-year-old 'ghost ship' anchored in a small creek and took pictures of the rusting yacht with a colorful past.

According to Queen City Discovery, a Cincinnati blog, the 186-foot yacht was last owned by a Lawrenceburg, Kentucky local named Robert Miller who bought it in the late 80s.

However, the ship's past goes all the way back to 1902, when it was first named The Celt and owned by a rich railroad executive.

The boat then went on to aid in the two World Wars, transport scientist Thomas Edison and even appear in  Madonna music video before finding its way to the creek in Kentucky where it has been anchored for the last 30 years.

The Celt left the hands of its first owner in 1917, when the US Navy started renting small, fast boats to outmaneuver German U-Boats to supply Great Britain during World War I.

The boat was renamed the Sachem and was outfitted with depth charges to sink U-boats and machine guns to defend against torpedoes.

What happened: The boat was most recently owned by a Cincinnati resident named Robert Miller, who parked it in the creek in the late 80s. He reportedly bought boat to restore it for a museum

New Yorker: The boat was last used by the Circle Line Company to ferry tourists around Manhattan. During its time with the tourist company, the boat was named the 'Sightseer' before being called the 'Circle Line V' - still visible on the side of the boat

Light bulb inventor: Thomas Edison used the boat during World War I to transport government-funded experiments

It was during World War I that the Sachem was used by scientist Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb.

Edison used the boat in government-funded experiments conducted in New York Harbor, before he sailed the ship down to Key West, Florida.

At the end of the war in November 1918, the ship was returned back to its original owner but it soon was sold again, eventually ending in the hands of Captain Jacob 'Jake' Martin of Brooklyn, New York.

Captain Martin bought the boat in 1932, taking advantage of its low price during the Great Depression. The Brooklyn native used the ship as a fishing vessel and ran a business charging anyone who wanted to board $2 entry. Some boarded the boat for fun, while others used it to catch fish for their family.

Wartime helper: During World War II, the boat was used to train soldiers learning how to use sonar equipment

When the U.S. entered World War II in 1941, the boat returned to the Navy where it was renamed the USS Phenakite and used this time to train soldiers learning to use sonar equipment in Key West Harbor.

It was eventually assigned to patrol Long Island Sound, were it spent the rest of the war before being returned to Captain Martin.

After the war, the boat was used to ferry tourists around Manhattan for the Circle Line Company. It was first named the 'Sightseer' and later became the 'Circle V', which is the name still seen painted on the side.

Today: Robert Miller bought the boat for $7,500 in 1986 and sailed it to his property on the Ohio River where it has remained for the last 30 years

In the 1980s, when demand for the boats grew, the Circle V was retired and parked on the New Jersey side of New York harbor.

In 1986, a Cincinnati local named Robert Miller purchased the ship for the low price of $7,500 and spent 10 days restoring the yacht so it could make the journey to the Midwest.

While working on the boat one day, a limousine pulled up to the dock and representative for Madonna asked if they could use the ship in an upcoming music video.

Miller agreed and the boat can briefly be seen in the video for single 'Papa Don't Preach'.

After using the boat to take friends out on New York Harbor for the ceremonial relighting of the Statue of Liberty during the July 4 weekend, Miller took the boat back home.

The ship traveled up the Hudson, through the Great Lakes, down the Mississippi River and into the Ohio River, before settling in a creek on his property in Northern Kentucky.

A man who claims to be Miller commented on the Queen City Discovery blog, saying he bought the boat with the intention of restoring it for a museum.
