Billionaire investor 
George Soros got married for the third time on Saturday to his 42-year-old fiancée Tamiko Bolton.

The
 83-year-old philanthropist tied the knot with Bolton, a
 health care consultant, in a small, but lavish, wedding at his Caramoor estate in Bedford, an hour away from New York City.

The bride's dress was designed by U.S.-based, Lebanon-born Reem Acra, whose gowns have been worn on the red carpet by many stars, including Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Lopez.

Soros put a Graff wedding band on Bolton’s finger during the half-hour ceremony, according to a source.

Federal judge Kimba Wood officiated at the non-denominational wedding, which was attended only by family members, including Soros’ five 
children from his two previous marriages.

The
 wedding ceremony was followed by a reception on Saturday evening 
with more than 500 guests at an arts center in nearby Katonah.

Chef
 Bo Bech of the Geist Restaurant in Copenhagen prepared the food.

Soros and Bolton first dined at Geist when visiting Copenhagen, Denmark, in 2009.

It
 comes as little surprise that the occasion would be marked with a bit of
 fanfare.

Long haul: The couple met in 2008 and announced their engagement in 2012 (seen here at a different event in 2012)

The three-day celebration already began on Friday with a dinner 
followed by a reception at the Museum of Modern Art with a special 
preview of the new Rene Magritte exhibit.

The
 estate in Bedford itself has its own grandiose history as Soros bought it a decade
 ago from Michael Crichton, the author of Jurassic Park.

The reception
featured Hungarian composer and conductor Iván Fischer, a family friend, 
who created a new arrangement for the occasion, which was presented 
with the Budapest Festival Orchestra.

Cape Verdean singer Mayra Andrade 
performed with the Harris Lane Orchestra.

The reception was festooned with lavish floral centerpieces including a huge hot-air balloon made of flowers.

Andrade and Roma ensemble 
Via Romen will perform at a Sunday brunch tomorrow.

Guests
 at the various events included World Bank President Jim Yong Kim and 
some foreign leaders, including Hendrik Toomas Ilves, president of 
Estonia; Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, president of Liberia; and Edi Rama, 
prime minister of Albania.

Also
 expected to have attended were fellow titans of the hedge fund world, Paul 
Tudor Jones and Julian Robertson.

From the political realm those invited
 included Minority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy 
Pelosi of California and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, both 
Democrats.

George Soros seen arriving at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, September 20, 2013. The 83-year-old billionaire investor is in New York to marry health care and education consultant, Tamiko Bolton

Age is just a number: At 42-years-old, Ms Bolton is almost half her husband's age

Soros,
 who established one of the first hedge funds in 1969 and is probably 
best known for his big bet against the British pound in 1992, met Bolton
 at a dinner party in 2008.

Their engagement was announced in August 2012.

Bolton,
 who was raised in California, is the daughter of a nurse and a retired 
naval officer. She graduated from the University of Utah and holds an 
MBA from the University of Miami. Bolton has been a consultant and 
entrepreneur working in the fields of health and education.

The bride's dress has been 
designed by U.S.-based, Lebanese-born designer Reem Acra, whose gowns 
have shown up on the red carpet on many stars, including Angelina Jolie 
and Jennifer Lopez.

For 
Soros, who has a net worth of $20 billion, according to Forbes, this will
 be his third marriage. It will be the second for Bolton.

When
 asked if there is a prenuptial agreement, the source familiar with the 
wedding arrangements said that Soros's lawyer, William D. Zabel, 
reiterated his comments from last year that 'Soros will leave the bulk 
of his estate to charity but he intends to provide generously for his 
wife'.

Previous wives: Soros was married to his first 
wife Annaliese (left) from 1960 to 1983, and then was married to Susan 
Weber Soros (right) from 1983 to 2005

In 2011, Soros, who is an 
active contributor to politically liberal causes and frequently speaks 
on world economic events, converted his hedge fund into a family office 
and stopped managing money for outside investors.

In
 the past three decades, the Hungarian-born Soros has given away more 
than $7 billion to promote democracy, foster free speech, improve 
education and fight poverty around the world, according to his 
foundation's website on www.opensocietyfoundations.org.

Soros was divorced from Annaliese Witschak in 1983 and Susan Weber Soros in 2005.

In
 lieu of gifts, the couple asked that donations be made to charities 
including Global Witness, Harlem's Children Zone, National Dance 
Institute, Planned Parenthood and the Roma Education Fund.
