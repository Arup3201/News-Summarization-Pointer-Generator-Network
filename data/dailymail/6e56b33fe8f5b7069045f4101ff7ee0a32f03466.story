Robert F Kennedy feared his children would be blinded by the mafia in an acid attack as revenge attack for investigating them, his widow has revealed.

Speaking out for the first time in 30 years, Ethel Kennedy said that her late husband was anxious they would be targeted as retaliation for his probe into mafia racketeering.

He saw a report about an American journalist who had been blinded in an acid attack by the mob and feared they would do the same to him.

The disclosure will add to conspiracy theories that the mafia may have been responsible for Kennedy’s death.

He was shot dead by Sirhan Sirhan in 1968 but speculation has raged that his crusade against the mob whilst serving as U.S. Attorney General may have be the root of his demise.

Mrs Kennedy opened up to promote ‘Ethel’, a new film about her life directed by her daughter Rory, the youngest of her eleven children.

Mrs Kennedy, 83, said that her last husband was scared after New York Post journalist Victor Riesel was blinded in an acid attack because of articles he had written about the mob.

‘We were told they were going to do the same with our children,’ she said.

Her eldest daughter Kathleen, one of several family members interviewed for the film, added: ‘We couldn’t leave school with the other kids at the end of the day.

‘We had to wait in the principal’s office to be picked up.’

The conspiracy theories relating to the 
mob and the Kennedy family usually involve New Orleans mafia don Carlos 
Marcello, who was deported to Guatemala by Mr Kennedy in 1961 after he 
was appointed Attorney General by his brother John.

Afterwards Marcello is said to have threatened John F Kennedy with the traditional Sicilian curse ‘Take the stone from my shoe’.

And when the President died, Marcello associate Jimmy Hoffa is supposed to have said: ‘This means Bobby is out as Attorney General.’

The film about Mrs Kennedy also gives a rare glimpse into life inside Camelot and amusing details, such as how Mr Kennedy slid down the White House bannister when his brother became president.

She reveals that it was very hard for her husband to seek office for the first time and that he had to ‘struggle for everything’ before becoming a senator in New York in 1964.

There is also colour about her own life including how she held wild parties which President Kennedy asked her to tone down, and that she was once charged with horse theft after she rescued a neighbour’s malnourished stallions.

The Kennedy family were back in the 
spotlight last week after John F. Kennedy Jr’s former assistant revealed
her deep regret for convincing his wife to board the doomed flight 
which crashed and killed them both.

In
her memoir RoseMarie Terenzio said she ‘should have kept her mouth 
shut’ rather than speak to Carolyn Bessette on July 16, 1999.

Carolyn
had reportedly been going through problems with her husband but Ms 
Ternzio helped patch things up and persuaded her to travel with him to a
wedding in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.

According to reviews ‘Ethel’ does not touch on the other family tragedies that befell Mrs Kennedy after her husband’s death.

Her son David died of a drug overdose in 1984 and another son Michael was killed in a skiing accident in 1997.

There is also no mention of the notorious Martha Moxley murder case and her nephew Michael Skakel who was convicted over it in 2002.
