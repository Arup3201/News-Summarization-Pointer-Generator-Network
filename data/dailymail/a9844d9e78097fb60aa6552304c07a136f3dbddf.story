Arsenal have re-started talks over a new contract for France striker Olivier Giroud.

The 27-year-old is contracted until 2016 but Arsenal's offer would take him to 2018 if he agrees.

Giroud joined Arsenal two years ago and has scored 39 goals in 98 games in all competitions.

New deal: Arsenal will offer striker Olivier Giroud a two-year extension to his existing contract, keeping him at the club until 2018 

Plans: Manager Arsene Wenger clearly views his compatriot as an integral member of his squad

Competition: Chilean star Alexis Sanchez, who has signed from Barcelona for £35m, will challenge Giroud for his place in the team

He faces competition for his place next season from new £35million signing Alexis Sanchez, but Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is keen for Giroud to stay and fight for his place.

Giroud scored at this summer's World Cup as France were eliminated at the quarter-final stage.
