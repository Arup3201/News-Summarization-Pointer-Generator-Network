Former England hero Paul Gascoigne has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and placed on a three-day emergency detox following his latest alcohol binge.

Gascoigne, the ex-Newcastle, Tottenham and Rangers star who retired in 2004, was rushed to hospital at 3am on Friday morning after police were called to his home in Dorset.

The 47-year-old had to be assessed by medics just hours before the police arrived at his house in Poole. His condition was considered to be stable however he has reportedly worsened over the next 12 hours.

Gascoigne has suffered a long battle with alcoholism and was previously sectioned six years ago.

Close friend and former teammate Gary Mabbutt told The Sun: 'He has been detained for his best interests. Paul has had a relapse and hasn't been well for a couple of weeks now.

'The best support available is being given to Paul. Hopefully he can get on the road to recovery.'

A source also told the paper that Gascoigne had not been in a 'good state' and police and doctors were 'really worried about him'.

The star, who made 57 appearances for his country, has been in rehab seven times and was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008, following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

His seventh stint in rehab was in January this year when he checked into a £6,000-a-month treatment clinic in Southampton.

The most recent binge comes just months after he was hospitalised for an alcoholic breakdown.

In August he was found collapsed outside his home clutching a bottle of gin and was taken to Poole Hospital where he was treated for four days.

Last month the star was pictured cradling a chicken whilst enjoying a pint and speaking to locals in a pub beer garden.

But things for the troubled footballer appeared to be on the up after he was spotted with walking hand-in-hand with a woman who he is reportedly dating.

Friends had said last week that they hoped Mandy Thomas, a public services worker, would save him from his battle against alcohol after she stayed by his side during his most recent relapse. 

Ms Thomas, who is separated from her husband and has two children, is said to be 'besotted' with the star with whom she has become 'inseparable'.

A spokesman for his former club Spurs told the newspaper: 'We are aware of the situation with Paul and continue to offer our support.' 

Gascoigne's agent Terry Baker told MailOnline that the star 'is not very well' but refused to comment on his condition any further.
