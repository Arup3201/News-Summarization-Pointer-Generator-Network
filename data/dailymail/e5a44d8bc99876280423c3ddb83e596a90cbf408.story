All six astronauts were given the day off for Christmas Eve and Christmas

A small group of astronauts living on the jointly-owned International Space Station are ringing in the holidays in zero gravity.

Hundreds of miles above the Earth's surface, the six members of the station’s Expedition 34 crew ate a turkey dinner with yams, exchanged gifts and spoke with their families by video on Tuesday.

The international crew members, three of whom arrived on December 21, are spending both Christmas and the New Year aboard the spacecraft.

NASA astronaut Tom Marshburn, Canadian Space Agency astronaut Chris Hadfield and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko arrived at the station last week, joining NASA astronaut Kevin Ford and Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin.

The three additional members filled out the $100 billion space station laboratory to its usual 6-person capacity.

All six astronauts were given the day off for Christmas Eve and Christmas.

That means that they don't need to work on any of the 110 experiments aboard the station and can take as much time for meals as they want, NASA spokeswoman Nicole Cloutier-Lamasters told SPACE.com.

Some of the crew members will still experience homesickness, they said.

Marshburn, who has a 10-year-old daughter, said he will miss being with his family as he hovers several hundred miles over them.

‘That'll be tough, thinking about her waking up in the morning, enjoying things,’ Marshburn said during a pre-flight interview with NASA. ‘But the fact is we've got some technology that'll allow me to be able to join in with them and see their faces and they can see me.

‘It'll be a little tough for me, as it would be for anybody, but I think the price is certainly well worth it, to be up there.’

Romanenko said the prospect of a space Christmas is exciting.

‘I think it will be a big adventure, a big moment in our space life,’ the Russian cosmonaut told NASA before heading into space. ‘And we'll be dressing up, we'll be decorating the station, we'll put up a Christmas tree.’

NASA’s International Space Station is a liveable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit and the ninth space station to be inhabited.

The ISS provides a platform for its astronauts to conduct scientific research that cannot be performed from Earth.

The fields of research include astrobiology, astronomy, space medicine, life sciences and physical sciences.

The ISS program is a joint project among five participating space agencies: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Russian Federal Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

The first piece of the space station launched in 1998.

Seasonal well-wishers can send the ISS's Expedition 34 crew a holiday card through NASA’s website.
