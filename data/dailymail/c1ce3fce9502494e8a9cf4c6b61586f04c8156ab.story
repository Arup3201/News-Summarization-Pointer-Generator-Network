Fan letters are believed to be among nearly a dozen letters found by police inside accused murderer Harriet Wran's jail cell.

Ms Wran, the daughter of former NSW premier Neville Wran, had her prison cell raided on Friday morning as part of investigations into the stabbing death of a Sydney drug dealer.

Several documents believed to contain correspondence about the murder charges against the 26-year-old, her boyfriend Michael Lee and their co-accused Lloyd Haines were seized in the search, 2GB reports.

The Sunday telegraph also reported, there were a number of letters seized from prison inmates expressing their support 
for Wran, according to an official source.

Detectives found the documents, including a letter, in Wran's Silverwater cell, located in the therapeutic unit of the women's wing.

It is understood that the cells of Lee, 35, and Haines, 29, were also searched the day before.

It's believed the letters did not all appear to have been sent via the jail's sanctioned postal service. Instead, some were probably passed personally or with the assistance of other inmates, when Lee and Haines were both at the MRRC (Metropolitan Remand and Reception Centre ) reported the Sunday Telegraph.

By exchanging letters this way, it can avoid the contents being screened by authorities.

The official also claimed the letters would be handy for the prosecution, with one allegedly containing information about the night of the murder.

The trio have not been charged over the alleged seizure of the letters.

Police are continuing to investigate the brutal stabbing death of drug dealer Daniel McNulty in a Redfern public housing block on August 10.

Another man stabbed in the altercation, allegedly over a $70 drug deal gone wrong, was taken to St Vincent's hospital in a stable condition but has since suffered a stroke as a result of his injuries.

Wran has indicated she will plead not guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder and aggravated break and enter.
