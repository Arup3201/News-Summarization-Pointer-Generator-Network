A dog-loving couple have adopted a golden retriever they found stabbed and left for dead while they were on holiday in Greece.  

Carol and Les Stones were so upset when they saw the dog they organised an animal charity to fly him to their house in Greater Manchester as soon as they arrived home. 

The dog arrived and the couple and their family aptly called him Chance.  

He was just hours from death when he was plucked from the streets of Laganas in Zante and taken to a vet.

Carol Stones said Chance has now settled in with the rest of her family pets at their home near Bolton

Mrs Stones was on holiday with her husband Les, 57, and son Matthew,  24, when they spotted Chance living on the streets.

'It was heartbreaking,' she said.

'The first time we saw him he was sheltering under a car from the sun and the driver almost ran him over. She just drove off and was not bothered at all.

'I whistled him over and gave him something to eat and drink. He was starving and very thirsty.

We saw him a few times and we noticed he had got this injury the day before we came home, we tried to get him some help. 

I thought he had been bitten by another dog. When they eventually found him, they said he was quite poorly and the wound had got infected.

The Stones family found Chance in the resort of Laganas, near to where they were staying, and visited him 

'It's an awful way of life for the stray dogs.'

The family caught up with Chance several times during their holiday and were devastated to leave him when they returned to Farnworth.

'We had tried to find out how to rescue him but weren't able to do that while we were there,'added Mrs Stones. 

Chance was rescued and flown to the UK from Zante

On their return to England Mrs Stones, 60, contacted Holbrook Animal Rescue, in Sussex, who visit Zante regularly to rescue dogs and asked if they could find Chance.

'At first they were unable to find him but then, one day, they contacted me to say they had found him,' she said.

'I felt as if I had won the lottery. I was elated.'

Chance was taken to a local vet and found to have a very serious wound - thought to have been caused by stabbing.

'I was told he was very close to death and lucky to have been rescued,' said Mrs Stones. 

Chance was flown to England and now lives with the family and their other pets; a Newfoundland called Oscar, Carter the German Shepherd and shih tzu Daisy, as well as three cats.

The dog is fed four times a day to help build his weight up and receives a lot of care and attention from the family after his ordeal. 

Mrs Stones added: 'He is absolutely brilliant. We've had him two weeks now. He was quite timid when he first came, and very unsure. 

He was sort of on guard with other dogs, especially during feeding time. He has lived on the streets and any scrap of food was valuable. I was worried that we had taken on too much. 

'But he's a totally different dog. He's quite a confident dog now. He is happy and wagging his tail.

'He never knew what it was to play with another animal.'

The family went on holiday in July and had to wait almost three months to get Chance back home. They contacted Holbrook Animal Rescue, which took around a week to find him, and the dog then had to treated by a vet before he could be flown home to them.
