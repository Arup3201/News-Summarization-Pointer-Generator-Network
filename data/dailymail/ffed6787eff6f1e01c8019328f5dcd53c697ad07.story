When her five-year-old daughter began complaining that her legs hurt, her GP put it down to growing pains.

But when the pain became so terrible that weeks later her mother had to carry her around the house, it became clear that something was terribly wrong.

Doctors discovered that Alyssia Clayton-Minta had juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) - a rare and serious form of arthritis.

Brave youngster: Charlotte Clayton and her daughter Alyssia, who suffers the rare condition

Alyssia was so poorly that her mother had to carry her around the house and even had to carry her into school

Alyssia was in so much agony that her 
mother Charlotte Clayton had to carry her around the house and even had 
to carry her into school.

After
Ms Clayton, 41, became so concerned that in January she took Alyssia to
see a specialist and after a series of tests, the youngster was 
diagnosed with JIA.

Now, five months later, after treatment and an operation, Ms Clayton said Alyssia is a changed child.

The
youngster is still undergoing treatment and physiotherapy at Alder Hey 
Children's Hospital in Liverpool but she is able to ride a bike again 
and, two weeks ago, she took part in PE for the first time since being 
diagnosed.

Alyssia, who has
arthritis in both knee joints and her ankles, has a 30 per cent chance 
that she could have the condition for life.

Doctors do not know what caused the condition, but said it could be genetic or it be related to stress after Alyssia's parents broke up last year

The condition usually develops in youngsters much older than Alyssia

Although JIA affects about one in every 1,000 children, it usually develops in youngsters much older than Alyssia.

Doctors do not know what caused the condition, but said it could be genetic or it be related to stress after Alyssia's parents broke up last year.

Ms Clayton said: 'I had to carry her from room to room and carry her into school - it was horrendous.

'She was that stiff that she was coming down the stairs on her bottom and she was in a lot of pain.

'Alyssia is quite tough and resilient, but it was frustrating for her because she is quite active and she wanted to be playing with her friends in the snow.'

Ms Clayton, a beautician from Bolton, Greater Manchester, said everyone had rallied around and helped Alyssia, and she praised her daughter's school for their support.

Staff at Ladybridge Primary School let Ms Clayton park next to the school office so she could carry Alyssia inside, and they organised a rota of staff and Year Six children to come and sit with the Year One pupil at break time.

Teaching assistant Claire Acton and class teacher Gemma Bendelow even took it in turns to carry Alyssia in a class trip to Smithills Farm to make sure she did not miss out.

Ms Acton said: 'She is a lovely little girl and we are so glad she isn't in pain any more.'

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic form of arthritis that affects children under 16. Idiopathic means that there is no known cause. 

In the UK, between 10,000 and 15,000 children are affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

The most common symptoms for all types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are swollen, painful and stiff joints that are usually worse in the morning. The joint areas may look red and feel hot to touch.

The exact cause of juvenile idiopathic arthritis isn’t known, but it’s thought to be an autoimmune disorder - which means that the immune system attacks the body instead of defending the body against infection and other harmful substances.
