The billionaire owner of the Indianapolis Colts is seen struggling to stand in video that has just been released from his Operating a Vehicle While Intoxicated arrest earlier this year.

Jim Irsay was stopped shortly before midnight on March 16 in Carmel, Indiana, for going 10 mph in a 35 mph zone, and, after failing a field sobriety test, he was arrested under suspicion of DUI and drug possession.

Officers found prescription pills in his car, along with $29,000 cash.

Stopped: Indianpolis Colts owner Jim Irsay (circled in red) was pulled over on March 16 of this year on suspicion of DUI

Revealed: Now, dashcam footage of the arrest has been released (above) that shows him struggling to stand

Booked: Irsay would ultimately fail his field sobriety test 

Now, dashcam footage from the cop car shows just how bad Irsay appeared that evening, as he stumbles and comes close to falling in the first few minutes of the video, which is almost an hour long. 

Later, he sits on the hood of the police car and seems to have difficulty following the officer's flash light as the move it from side to side. 

He told officers that he had not been drinking and had not taken any pills that evening.

The officer reported Irsay, 55, had glassy eyes and that a pill bottle was present in a briefcase on the passenger side of his vehicle, a Toyota Highlander.

Oddly enough, the starting cost to purchase a Highlander is almost exactly how much cash Irsay had on him at the time of the arrest.

Shortly after his arrest he decided to enter rehab, no doubt a smart decision as one area sports writer from the Indy Star penned a column just two days after the incident saying, 'For years, Colts insiders have known that Irsay was struggling again with drugs.'

While he was away, his daughter Carlie began to handle the day-to-day operations of the team.

In September, Irsay pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of driving while under the influence of prescription drugs. 

And while the court went somewhat easy on him, giving him just a year of probation and no jail time, the NFL gave him the biggest punishment they can dole out on a team's owner under the league's personal conduct policy - a six game suspension and $500,000 fine. 

Irsay, whose team won the Super Bowl in 2007, has been the Colts owner since the death of their previous owner, his father Robert, in 1997.
