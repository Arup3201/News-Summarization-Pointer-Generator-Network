A backpack found by police searching for missing Alice Gross contained the trainers she was wearing when she went missing, it has been revealed. 

The bag contained a pair of Vans trainers detectives believe the 14-year-old had on when she left home in Hamwell in west London on the day of her disappearance.

It also contained a change of underwear, her lunch box and the rubbish from her lunch, police said today.

It comes after detectives released a map of the last known journey of Alice as they renewed their appeal for information - two weeks after the teenager disappeared.

CCTV has helped officers piece together the movements of the schoolgirl on August 28, but they still have not heard from any witnesses who saw her after 4.30pm that day.

Detectives have also revealed that a missing battered iPhone belonging to Alice may hold 'key' information that may help find her.

The white iPhone 4S with a distinctive cracked case Alice had colourfully decorated herself has yet to be found, two weeks since she vanished in west London, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers said. 

He said police had no evidence that the anorexic schoolgirl from Hanwell was being bullied on social media but hoped finding her phone might uncover any secret communications she might have had.

He also revealed that her black Vans rucksack, found by the edge of the River Brent, contained a change of underwear and also the Vans denim trainers she is believed to have been wearing when she left home on August 28. 

Police believe she may have taken another pair of shoes with her or bought some new ones at a nearby shopping centre she walked to.

No money or purse was found. 

But he also said the bag had been disturbed by two builders working nearby before being returned to where they found it, and it was possible other people had rifled it and moved it and its contents as well.

Mr Chalmers said that Alice, who was being treated for anorexia, was last seen on CCTV at around 4.30pm on August 28, but her iPhone continued to connect to the network until shortly after 5pm.

He called on anyone who might have picked up her smartphone to contact police as soon as possible. 

And he renewed his appeal for anyone who saw Alice between 1.02pm, when she was in Church Path, and 4.26pm when she was walking along Trumpers Way, to come forward.

So far no CCTV has been traced that shows Alice after this time.

Detectives say the Alice Gross, pictured, last used her iPhone to send a text to her father on the day she went missing

Officers have produced a map outlining the 14-year-old's route from her home in Hamwell, west London towards Brentford along the Grand Union Canal.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Chalmers,  leading the investigation, said: 'We know that Alice's bag was first found the day after she was last seen by two builders, who we have spoken to, who put it back down in the same spot on the towpath. 

'What we do not know is if anyone saw or found Alice's bag between when she was last caught on CCTV and when the builders found it.'

Detectives say the teenager last used her iPhone to send a text to her father on the day she went missing. 

'I need to know if anyone found Alice's bag before the builders and was anything taken from it, or if anyone has her iPhone,' Mr Chalmers added. 

'Did you find or see a white iPhone 4s with a cracked rear case, that Alice had decorated with marker pen? If you did do you still have it? 

'I can assure you that if you did or you know someone that did, you are not in trouble, but you may have vital information that can take us one step further to finding Alice.' 

Officers say there is no truth in speculation that a family disagreement had sparked Alice's disappearance

Alice, who was being treated for anorexia, was last seen on CCTV at around 4.30pm on August 28

He said there was no truth in speculation that a family disagreement had sparked Alice's disappearance and that she went out on that day 'just like usual'. 

'Her family are distraught,' the detective said.

'Their daughter has now not been seen or heard from for 14 days. Please help us find Alice and bring her home to them.'

Alice's family renewed their desperate appeal for people to come forward.

A 25-year-old man arrested by detectives investigating the disappearance was bailed on Tuesday until mid September.

A 51-year-old man who was arrested by officers in Hanwell on Sunday September 7 was released with no further action on September 8.

Alice's family, said:'We all dearly love and miss Alice, not only her whole family but also her friends, teachers and the wider community.
