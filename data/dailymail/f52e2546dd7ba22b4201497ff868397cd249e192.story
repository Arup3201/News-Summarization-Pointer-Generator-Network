A disgruntled paramedic trainee, who didn't pass a psychometric test, set alight an ambulance station and two vans causing $6 million in damage as a blatant act of revenge, a court has heard.

Jodie La Spina pleaded guilty to two counts of arson and unlawful use of a motor vehicle after being found by emergency services workers at the scene on October 26, 2010 in Cleveland - about 25km southeast of Brisbane.

Despite receiving a three-year sentence at the Brisbane District Court on Tuesday, the 27-year-old will be released on three years' probation on Friday after already spending more than four years behind bars - including 20 months in a mental health facility, The Courier Mail reported.

La Spina purchased a lighter from a service station and jemmied open a door at the Cleveland Ambulance Station before taking the keys to one of the two vans inside the building which she set alight with accelerant ethanol, the court heard.

She then drove the ambulance to her bike and set fire to the van.

Crown prosecutor Maita Aylward said La Spina made threats to burn down another ambulance while being transported as a patient three months earlier.

Ms Aylward told the court that she said to the officers: 'Ambulance van 292 was "a shitbox" and she was going to burn it down'.

Ms Aylward said La Spina 'staged the scene' by laying her motorcycle down to concoct a story that the ambulance driver knocked over her bike.

She also changed her stories twice and then said she could not recall anything from that night. 

Ms Aylward said La Spina's motive was revenge because her Queensland Ambulance Service was rejected due failing a psychometric test.

Marty Barrett, who lives across the road from the station, told Daily Mail Australia, that he still recalls the 2010 blast like it was yesterday.

'I was laying in bed when I heard weird noises so I went outside and thought I would try to rescue the ambulances but gas started exploding and I knew it wasn't worth risking my life for,' he said.

Mr Barrett couldn't comprehend the deliberate arson attack.

'The service only does good so why would someone want to do damage to it? It's unnatural.'  

The Cleveland Ambulance Station reopened just a few months ago after the 2014 arson attack

The rebuild of the new ambulance station cost more than $2million
