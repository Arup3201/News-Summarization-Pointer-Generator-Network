Shock: Rebecca Hains said she was told her cake's icing could be explosive

Of all the TSA regulations, this one really takes the cupcake.

At least that's the view of Rebecca Hains, 35, of Massachusetts, who had the pastry confiscated before she boarded a flight in Las Vegas last month.

But the Transportation Security Administration is sticking by its decision to confiscate the treat.

The TSA said in its blog yesterday that the cupcake was packed in a jar filled with icing, which is considered a gel under a policy designed to secure travellers from terrorists seeking to evade detection by using explosives made of plastics, liquids or gels.

The measures were put in place as a result of the failed 2006 plot in the UK to detonate liquid explosives on transatlantic airliners.

The TSA said that the 1995 'Bojinka Plot' by World Trade Center bombing suspect Ramzi Yousef and 9/11 plotter Khalid Sheikh Muhammad also played a role in the regulations.

In that plot, the two planned to use liquid explosives in small containers to bomb aeroplanes bound for the U.S.

liquids

Ms Hains, of Peabody, was blocked from taking the cupcake onto a plane last month when a TSA agent said icing in the jar exceeded amounts of gels allowed in carry-on luggage. 

Ms Hains has called that 'terrible logic.'

She claimed she had passed through security at Boston's Logan International Airport earlier that week with two cupcakes packaged in jars that were gifts from a student.

But she said the agent told her that just meant TSA agents in Boston didn't do their job.

Ms Hains ultimately surrendered the cupcake, but said the encounter highlighted a lack of common sense by the agent and the ludicrousness of TSA policies.

She said: 'It's not really about the cupcake; I can get another cupcake. It's about an encroachment on civil liberties.'

The TSA said travellers can take cakes, pies and cupcakes through security checkpoints but should expect they might get additional screening.

TSA blogger Bob Burns wrote: 'If something doesn't seem right, there is always the potential you won’t be able to take it through.'

The saga with Ms Hains came a month after a similar incident involving the TSA, a passenger and a baked treat.

Florida man Joe Maltese and his wife were surprised to find that a TSA agent allegedly helped him or herself to a slice of cake placed in his luggage by his mother-in-law during a holiday visit to New York.

Speaking to MailOnline on Christmas Eve, Mr Maltese said he and his wife found that a three to four-inch piece of the cake had cleanly been cut out, but have found the humour in the situation.

He said: 'I thought it was funny. I wasn’t trying to get anybody fired.'
