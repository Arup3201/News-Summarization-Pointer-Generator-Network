Investigators found child pornography on Josh Powell's computer at least 17 months before he killed his children and himself, according to FBI documents.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported on Saturday that the documents show the FBI was investigating the disappearance of his wife, Susan Powell, as well as possession of child pornography.

Anne Bremner, an attorney for Susan Powell's parents, said the family was never told the FBI was investigating Josh Powell for child pornography. If the state of Washington's Department of Social and Health Services had known about the suspected child pornography, it 'never would have let him have those kids,' she said.

When a state worker delivered 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden to Josh Powell's rented home in Graham, Washington, on Feb. 5, 2012, Josh Powell locked out the worker and ignited a fire that killed him and his sons.

Susan Powell, who was last seen at her West Valley City, Utah, home on Dec. 6, 2009, has never been found.

Josh Powell had been previously linked to child pornography, the Tribune reported. At hearings in the state of Washington to determine custody of his children, then-Assistant Washington Attorney General John M. Long said Powell was under investigation for child pornography after cartoon images of incest between mothers and children were found on his computer in late 2009 or early 2010.

Josh Powell's two young sons suffered sexual abuse at the hands of their father before he killed them with a hatchet and blew up their Washington state home in 2012, according to a new tell-all book.

Gregg Olsen and Rebecca Morris, the authors of 'If I Can’t Have You: Susan Powell, Her Mysterious Disappearance, and the Murder of Her Children,' claim that they uncovered evidence proving that John and Susan Powell’s children, 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden, were molested while living with their father and paternal grandfather.

The boys’ maternal grandparents, Chuck and Judy Cox, first noticed that something was amiss with their grandkids when Charlie and Braden moved into their Utah home in 2011, two years after their mother's disappearance.

Inappropriate behavior: Chuck and Judy Cox, (pictured) noticed that their grandsons, Charlie (left) and Braden (right), refused to sleep clothed, telling them their father, Josh Powell, used to sleep naked with them

The book, based on interviews with the couple’s family and friends, claims that one night, the siblings refused to put on their pajamas while getting ready for bed, according to Radar Online.

'Who told you it’s okay to be naked?' Mr Cox asked the boys, to which they allegedly replied, 'Our daddy!'

After talking to Charlie, the grandfather learned that he and his brother slept naked in bed with John Powell, who also slept in the nude.

One of the brothers later drew a picture for Chuck Cox showing what appears to be a child next to an adult, accompanied by the chilling words, 'Don’t play with me!'

The book, which is out in stores today, 
suggests that there is also a possibility that Braden was molested by Josh's father, Steve, who was later charged
 with voyeurism for taking pictures of young girls who lived next door 
to him.

When the boys were taken from the custody of their father, Braden was diagnosed with a fungal skin 
infection; one way to contract this infection is through sexual contact, the authors said.

Charlie and Braden's maternal grandparents also noted that the kids started getting violent with one another.

Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her sons Braden and Charlie, vanished in 2009 and in the months ahead of her disappearance, her husband might have been poisoning her, friends have said

One night when the two were taking a bath together, Mr Cox walked in on Charlie holding his brother's head underwater.

The man later recalled that a few more seconds and the toddler likely would have suffocated.

Olson
 and Morris' book contains other disturbing allegations surrounding the 
Powell family drama, including claims that the father starved Charlie to 
the point of malnutrition and possibly poisoned his wife, Susan, before 
she vanished in 2009.

While
 29-year-old Susan Powell's body has never been found, her husband was 
long suspected of having a role in her disappearance. Then in February 
2012, he attacked his sons with a hatchet and blew them - and himself - 
up in his Washington state home.

Speaking to authors Olsen and Morris for their book, 'If I Can't Have You', the couple's friends have given a terrifying insight into the Powell household.

They claim that Josh Powell, who was unemployed, controlled the family's finances - ordering his broker wife only to buy the cheapest groceries and refusing to feed the children three meals a day.

'Susan had to research what was on sale at what store,' Michele Oreno told the authors. 'Then she had to come home and put it into the computer, what she spent on every item.

Troubled: Her husband, Josh Powell, pictured, also withheld food from his young sons, friends said

Tragic: He killed himself and his sons in 2012 by striking them with a hatchet and blowing up the house

'[Josh] was
 really ticked off because the week before she had spent two cents more 
on a can of peas than he found at another store... It got so he wouldn’t
 give her money for food or anything.'

Susan even called friends to ask if she could sneak hot dogs from them because the boys were so hungry, friends said.

Then, when Charlie Powell was a year old, a doctor diagnosed him with malnutrition, the book said.

'He gets one meal a day at day care. That's all he needs,' Josh told Susan, according to friend Rachel Marini. 'You’re not wasting my food on him because he’s just going to poop it out!'

Friends added that they started to suspect him of poisoning his wife in October 2009, two months before she vanished.

She began to feel nauseous so wondered if she was pregnant before miscarrying, friends said.

'He made a 
lot of organic products for her to drink, a lot of thick yogurt stuff 
and fermented drinks with kefir,' friend Amber Hardman explained.

What did he know? Powell, pictured after his wife vanished, reportedly ordered his wife around in their home

Theories: The new insights were shared by friends in a book out Tuesday, left. It also suggests that one of the sons may have been sexually assaulted by Josh's father Steve, pictured in court, right

Susan's body was never found, although the search still continues.

Josh has claimed that his wife was at home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip in Utah's West Desert.

In February 2012, 36-year-old Josh Powell took his two sons into his home from a state supervisor, attacked them with a hatchet and then blew up the family home, killing all three.

Police documents from May 2012 reveal that Utah officials believe that Josh killed his wife and that his brother Michael helped dispose of her body. Michael killed himself in February 2013.
