The elderly former neighbour of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf and his Muslim convert wife Tara Nettleton has revealed what it was like to live next door to the couple before they fled to Syria with their five children.

Sharrouf, who is wanted by Australian Federal Police after he began fighting with terrorist organisation Islamic State, posted a photo of his seven-year-old son on Twitter holding up a decapitated head in the Middle East this week with the caption 'that's my boy'.

The image shocked the world and led to the boy’s Australian grandfather, Peter Nettleton, demanding the couple’s children be brought home to Australia.

Pensioner Joyce, who has lived in south-west Sydney for more than 30 years, said she was 'shocked' and 'disgusted' to see the photo of her former young neighbour.

'Kids at their age should be playing with toy guns,’ she said.

Joyce told Daily Mail Australia Sharrouf's wife Tara was always 'very polite' but things changed when she once commented on Tara wearing a niqab.

'We get on well until one day I saw her watering the garden, I said: "You're too pretty to wear those things". She never spoke to me again after then,' Joyce said.

She described Tara as a typical blonde Australian woman and said her children -  two girls and three boys - were also pleasant.

'She was quite tall, a solid girl,' she added.

‘Tara used to go out the back and sit on the step with her mum Karen in shorts but when the men came home she would cover up,’ Joyce added.

Joyce said Tara, who had her first child with Sharrouf when she was just 17, was ‘always coming and going with her mum who picked her up.’

Her mother Karen allegedly helped Tara flee to Malaysia with her children, where she claimed she would live with Sharrouf's sister, at the beginning of the year.

Her move came after Sharrouf escaped Australian authorities by using his brother’s passport to fly to Syria in December.

Joyce said she was not always worried about living next door to the couple until police helicopters descended on their small road in 2005. Daily Mail Australia has elected not to show her face.

‘Her husband [Sharrouf] often had all his friends out the front talking,' Joyce said.

Joyce said Tara, who had her first child with Sharrouf when she was just 17, was 'always coming and going with her mum who picked her up.'

Joyce said Tara looked like a typical blonde Australian woman and that she used to be polite to her

She said Sharrouf used to come home at 3am after being out with his friends and bang on the door saying ‘Tara let me in’.

But she said the family were ‘a very quiet family’ most of the time.

Her only conversation with Sharrouf, who she described as ‘arrogant’, was when she asked him to board up a hole in his fence because their kittens climbed under it into her garden.

‘The kids used to play out the back. The fence had a gap underneath it. He said “I’ll do it when I’m ready”.’

After the police raid on their home, Sharrouf was arrested in 2005 and was sentenced to five years' in jail for possessing items in preparation for a terrorist act.

Tara wrote a letter to the court explaining how, when he was released in 2009, they wanted to move to the country for a quiet life on a farm.

She claimed they wanted to bring up their kids safely.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the estranged stepmother of Tara Nettleton told Daily Mail Australia said Ms Nettleton was 'just a normal girl' growing up.

Sue Nettleton explained her and Tara’s father, Peter, don't know anything about what has happened to Tara and Sharrouf’s children.

Khaled Sharrouf and Tara Nettleton met at Chester Hill High School. He was two years older than her

Tara lost contact with her dad and stepmother over nine years ago, around the time she converted to Islam.

'I'm scared for the children,' truck driver Peter Nettleton told The Daily Telegraph on Tuesday.

However, Mr Nettleton said he doesn't even know the name of his grandchildren.

'She just went with him and converted, she never grew up religious, we weren’t religious,' he added.

Meanwhile, Tara's former friends have told how she and Sharrouf - who is two years older than her - got together at Chester Hill High School in Sydney's west.

He was expelled in year nine for hitting another student, The Australian reports, but they continued to date and both became strict Muslims.

They got married and moved to the bungalow near Joyce.

The home, which looks like any other suburban property, now has new tenants.
