SpaceX is set to build the world's first commercial site for orbital rocket launches in the southernmost tip of Texas.

The move was helped by $15.3 million (£9 million) in incentives from Texas that will allow SpaceX to have greater control over the timing of its launches.

The company has said it plans to launch 12 rockets a year from the Boca Chica Beach in Brownsville, a short walk from the Gulf of Mexico and a couple miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he plans to build the world's first commercial site for orbital rocket launches in the southernmost tip of Texas. The move was helped by $15.3 million (£9 million) in incentives from Texas

Governor Rick Perry's office said Monday it will provide $2.3 million (£1.36 million) from the Texas Enterprise Fund.

The state will offer an additional $13 million (£7.7 million) from the Spaceport Trust Fund to the Cameron County Spaceport Development Corporation to pay for infrastructure development.

'Texas has been on the forefront of our nation's space exploration efforts for decades, so it is fitting that SpaceX has chosen our state as they expand the frontiers of commercial space flight,' Governor Perry said in a prepared statement.

SpaceX plans to make an $85 million investment and create 300 jobs. The company already has a rocket testing facility in McGregor that employs 250 people.

In April, Nasa agreed to lease launch pad 39A at Cape Canaveral to SpaceX. The company also launches from California. Pictured is today's launch of the AsiaSat 8 satellite on a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral

Its chief executive Elon Musk, said, 'In addition to creating hundreds of high-tech jobs for the Texas workforce, this site will inspire students, expand the supplier base and attract tourists to the South Texas area.'

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket thundered off its coastal launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida today to put a commercial communications satellite into orbit.

On its second launch attempt of the day, the 224-foot (68-meter) rocket lifted off at 4 a.m. EDT/9am GMT, blazing through partly cloudy, pre-dawn skies as it headed into space.

The first try, 2-1/2 hours earlier, ended less than a minute before liftoff when a computer found a potential problem with the rocket's first-stage engine, SpaceX officials said in a live webcast.

The issue was resolved, clearing the rocket for flight. Perched on top of the Falcon 9 was a communications satellite owned by Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings, or AsiaSat.

The spacecraft, known as AsiaSat 8, will become the fifth member of an orbital network that provides telecommunication services to the Asia-Pacific region.

AsiaSat hired privately owned SpaceX for two satellite launches, the second of which is due to launch later this month

Brownsville Mayor Tony Martinez said he always knew Brownsville had a good shot at landing the facility.

Locations in Florida, Puerto Rico and Georgia had apparently been considered as well.

'It's a barrier breaker,' Mayor Martinez said. 'It opens up a lot of doors for a lot of things.' He said SpaceX hopes to have the first launch in 2016.

Gilberto Salinas, executive vice president of the Brownsville Economic Development Council, which also contributed funds, said the region's work is just beginning.

One of the site's biggest hurdles seemed to be its environmental impact. The site is bordered on three sides by state park land that's managed by the federal government as part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge.

But in late May, the Federal Aviation Administration released a final environmental review that found the project was unlikely to jeopardise the existence of protected animal species and would create few unavoidable impacts.

Rick Tumlinson, co-founder of Space Frontier Foundation and Texas Space Alliance, said in May that SpaceX's establishment of its launch site in Texas would be significant.

'What that means is we could at some point see flights originating in Texas that are carrying astronauts or passengers to the space station, orbital space hotels, to the moon and eventually even we might see human beings boarding spacecraft in Texas and flying to Mars,' Mr Tumlinson said. 'That's huge.'

Carissa Bryce Christensen, managing partner at The Tauri Group, a Virginia-based space and technology consulting firm, said in an interview in April that having its own launch site would give SpaceX predictability.

'SpaceX has made an absolute winning career of controlling its own destiny,' Bryce Christensen said. 'SpaceX is arguably the most integrated launch company there is. They do it all themselves.'

SpaceX's Dragon cargo ship already ferries supplies and experiments to and from the International Space Station for Nasa.

In April, Nasa agreed to lease launch pad 39A at Cape Canaveral to SpaceX. The company also launches from Vandenberg Air Force base in California.

SpaceX has proposed launching its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy - under development - rockets from Boca Chica.

There has been no indication that SpaceX will do space tourism at the Texas site.
