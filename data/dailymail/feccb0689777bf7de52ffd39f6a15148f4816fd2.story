Whitney Houston's mother has made another appearance in hospital to be at Bobbi Kristina's beside amid claims she is avoiding the 21-year-old's father. 

Cissy Houston arrived at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Sunday evening to visit her granddaughter, who is still in a coma fighting for her life.

However it has been claimed the 81-year-old former gospel singer is planning her trips so she doesn't bump into Bobby Brown.

The pair have been pictured arriving separately since Cissy flew in from her New Jersey home, and sources have told the Atlanta Journal Constitution it is deliberate. 

Bobbi Kristina also received a number of visitors, including close family friend Tyler Perry. She has now been in hospital for over a week.

It is not the first time each side of the family have been at odds when gathered in the same place.

Bobby Brown and his entourage arrived for Whitney's funeral in 2012, but quickly left because he was moved around three times by security.

The tragedy being carried by the family of this week hit even harder on Saturday, as relatives gathered at the 21-year-old's bedside on the three-year anniversary of her mother's death.

Whitney Houston died on February 11, 2012, the day before the Grammy awards of that year.

With this year's Grammy's set to take place Sunday, it was an eerie link between mother and daughter that added to the solemness of the situation at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

Bobbi Kristina remains comatose in the facility one week after being found facedown and not breathing in the bathtub of her home Roswell, Georgia, in a scene that echoed the death of her mother.

Bobbi's was seen arriving at the hospital with his entourage and his pregnant wife, Alicia, on Saturday.

The singer appeared tired and emotional after leaving the facility after about 90 minutes, The New York Daily News reported.

Grandmother Cissy Houston, who is said to be devastated over what happened following the death of her daughter, Whitney, arrived at the hospital one hour after Brown left.

Other family members were also seen entering.

There have been no updates on Bobbi's condition.

While police said they had found drugs in the house, it is not clear how Bobbi came to lose consciousness.

However on Friday it emerged that authorities were looking into a criminal investigation. 

Tragic: Bobbi Kristina with Whitney Houston in February 2012 - the singer was found dead two days later

According to TMZ, suspicious injuries found on Bobbi when she was taken to hospital made them suspect foul play may have been involved.

Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change', but her father has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye.

Bobbi was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home.

Lomas discovered Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said.

It was revealed on Friday that she could have been submerged for around 15 minutes before she was discovered.

She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update.

'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.'

Emergency: Cissy flew in from her New Jersey home earlier in the week

One person told the website: 'Cissy was traumatized losing Whitney in 2012 and the pain is still raw from that.

'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.'

She was also the most outspoken against the film about her daughter, which premiered last month.

'Lifetime has chosen to go ahead with the movie about Whitney in spite of my family's objections,' the bereaved mother said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight in June.

'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.'

Visit: As family stay by her side, police are investigation possible foul play

On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off.

'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said.

It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn.

Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter.
