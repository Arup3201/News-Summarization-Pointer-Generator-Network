A seven-year-old boy has the perfect antidote to bullies - a black belt in kickboxing.

Ethan Owers, from Gravesend, Kent, is believed to be one of the youngest in Britain to have gained a junior first degree black belt in the martial art.

During a four-hour grading session, he completed a range of exercises including 100 press ups, star jumps, sit ups and squat thrusts at Dartford's Combat Camp UK gym.

His mother, Kelly, 27, said today: 'We are really chuffed with him.

'It was hard work, particularly as he's so young and so small, but he's thrilled at what he's achieved and he just hammered it.

'It wasn't easy. He had to go through a load of exercises and had to show each level that he had worked through over the last three years, all in just one day.'

Ethan started training when he was three years old and gained inspiration from his mother and father, Jason, 35, who are both coaches and competitors in martial arts.

Mrs Owers added: 'Ethan will go on to the next stage now and work towards his second dan in black belt and maybe take part in light contact competitions.

'We have just left the choice down to him. We don't force him to do anything. He has a real passion for kickboxing and trains four times a week.

'Kickboxing requires discipline and respect, and teaches people life skills, as well as being good for keeping fit.'

Kickboxing is a group of martial arts based on kicking and punching. It is a wide term for a martial art developed from a number of disciplines, including Karate, Muay Thai and Western boxing.
