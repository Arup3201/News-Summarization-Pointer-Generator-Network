Prince William has told how he feared being captured on a 'kiss cam' sharing an intimate moment with his wife Kate.

The royal couple were pictured hugging and holding each other as cyclist Sir Chris Hoy and his team-mates raced to a gold medal.

William was worried the velodrome's roving 'kiss cam' would zero in on them and force them to pucker up.

Pucker up: President Obama gives his wife Michelle a kiss after a 'kiss cam' focused on them at a U.S. basketball team match in Washington

He told the BBC: ' I was absolutely dreading they were going to come and show myself and my wife. That would have been very embarrassing.'

'Kiss cams' - TV cameras which pick out fans at big sporting events and urge them to kiss - have become popular in America with President Barack Obama the latest celebrity in the frame.

Mr Obama and his wife Michelle Obama finally gave the people what they wanted while supporting the U.S. basketball Olympic team at a game in Washington.

They were caught  twice, but needed a little urging from the audience to smooch in front of all the fans. Eventually, the President gave in and pecked the First Lady on the lips.

Princes William and Harry gave the 2012 Games a surprise boost last night  when they talked to presenter Sue Barker about their Olympic experiences so far.

Informal: Both princes were dressed in open collar shirts with London 2012 pins on the lapels of their blazers

The Duke of Cambridge and his brother 
popped up during the BBC’s primetime early evening slot to offer their 
verdicts on Britain’s medal performances and give our athletes the royal
seal of approval.

There 
was also an affectionate tribute to their grandmother, the Queen, over 
her ‘secret hobby of parachuting’ which wowed millions during the 
opening ceremony.

In a remarkably relaxed few minutes, the two princes chatted so informally on the sofa it could almost have been the ‘Royal One Show’.

The presenter introduced her ‘very special guests’ using their full titles, but then casually directed her questions to ‘William’ and ‘Harry’.

Pride: Both William and Harry spoke fo how proud they were of their cousin Zara's equestrian success

The royal siblings joked about their grandmother's 'new hobby' - parachuting - and how she has been requested for the new Bond movie

With Olympic history unfolding behind 
them, the royal pair sat side by side in front of the stadium, sporting 
blazers and open neck shirts, and gave the clear impression they were 
having a great time at the ‘electrifying’ Games.

As
Harry put it: ‘We’ve had  a chance to be at quite a few events, but 
just to feel  the buzz of the British public getting behind the teams  
is astonishing.’

The 
princes spoke of their immense pride in their cousin Zara Phillips and 
her equestrian medal success – and revealed they were kept ‘completely 
in the dark’ about the Queen’s transformation to Bond girl in the 
Olympic opening ceremony.

The scenes, shot in Buckingham Palace and featuring the Queen alongside Bond star Daniel Craig, proved to be some of the most memorable in the extravaganza.

William admitted that he was terrified that the velodrome's kiss cam would force him kiss wife Kate in front of the crowd

Harry told Sue: ‘Both of  us were 
slightly surprised with our grandmother’s secret hobby that she had of 
parachuting, which went down unbelievably well.’

William said: ‘To be honest, we were kept completely in the dark about it, that’s how big the secret was.’

He
said Harry had ‘got a sniff’ of a rumour but they did not know for sure
until they saw the scenes. ‘She did such a good performance that she 
has now been asked to star in the next Bond film,’ he joked.

‘You
don’t expect the Queen to do something like that,’ Harry added, 
quipping: ‘What she does in her spare time is her spare time...’

The princes have been highly visible during the Games, not just enjoying themselves at the events, but acting as unofficial Olympic ambassadors for Britain’s image abroad.

William described the silver medal won by their cousin Zara’s team in the three-day equestrian event as ‘absolutely fantastic’, adding: ‘Emotionally I got completely carried away in the moment.’

Harry added: ‘We as cousins are very, very proud. It explains why we never get to see her as she is always riding.’
