Guilty: Paul Strickland, pictured arriving at Manchester magistrates' court today, bit his wife's face after discovering she had a new boyfriend

A top doctor who bit his wife's face when he discovered she had a new boyfriend has escaped jail after a judge praised his 'courage' for pleading guilty.

NHS consultant psychiatrist Paul Strickland, 51, sank his teeth into Dr Judith Richardson’s cheek at his home in Didsbury, Manchester, after finding out she was dating a mutual friend. 

He bit her repeatedly for five seconds, before pushing her against a wall and bending her arm backward.

Dr Richardson, also 51, a public health specialist, was left with a cheek injury and £500 worth of damage to her glasses following the attack.

Strickland - who works for the NHS in Salford, Trafford and Bolton - admitted assault and criminal damage at Manchester magistrates' court last month. 

However, he escaped jail today after District Judge Paul Richardson praised his 'courage' for pleading guilty - instead, sentencing him to a six-month community order, costs of £85 and a £60 victim surcharge.

The assault took place in January after Strickland, who is also an 'honorary' university lecturer, discovered Dr Richardson was in a relationship with another man, the court heard.

He left seven voicemail messages on his estranged wife’s phone, before deciding to confront her at her new boyfriend's home.

Strickland, who specialises in providing services for people with mental health, banged on the front door, but noone answered and he left the scene.

However, trouble erupted later that afternoon when Dr Richardson went to her the psychiatrist's home on Clothorn Road.

David Graham, prosecuting, said: 'He
 opened the door and immediately began an assault - pushing her onto a 
wall and biting her cheek for five seconds before pushing her backwards 
against the car. He took glasses off her face and snapped them causing 
£500 damage.

'As a result she was left with a bite mark to her cheek. This could be seen as a high level assault of its type.'

Brigid Baillie, defending, said 
Strickland had been on anti-depressants for two years following the 
breakdown of his 20-year marriage in 2010 and subsequent divorce in 
2012.

'He came off them in November last year 
and that was when things began to get on top of him,' she said.

'Things
 built up and he didn’t deal with them. He was experiencing stress at 
work. His mother has dementia and he has power of attorney. He would sometimes gets phone calls from the police about her going missing.

'He also felt his ex-wife had been gloating over the new relationship. At the time her new partner was a mutual friend.'

She added: 'He feels 
ashamed and very regretful it happened in the first place. There is 
genuine remorse. He
 is in a relationship and wants to move forward.'

At an earlier hearing, the court was told the couple
 had
 been married for 20 years, but had split up acrimoniously due to Strickland's 'increasingly controlling and jealous' behaviour.

He had reportedly assaulted his wife in 2009, but she had made no complaint at that time.

Sentencing Strickland, Judge Richardson said: 'Much of the background is very sad but it is not unique. People go through stuff a good deal worse than you have suffered and it does not result in violence.

'You had the courage to plead guilty. With your background, it makes it more difficult to face up to what has happened.

'I’m hoping you will find value in this because you are in new territory with people who find themselves in circumstances such as this more than you.'

Strickland now faces a 
disciplinary investigation by the General Medical Council and has been 
referred for psychiatric treatment over his behaviour.
