It's the game show that doesn't like to see asylum seekers sent home empty-handed.

Broadcast tonight for the first time, a Dutch TV programme will pit contestants set for deportation against each other in a quiz which will have the politically correct brigade tearing their hair out.

On Weg van Nederland, the would-be immigrants are asked a series of questions about the country they are being kicked out of.

Quite simply, whoever answers most correctly wins Â£3,500 to spend rebuilding their life - outside of the Netherlands.

Far from the Netherlands: The new game show, presented by Waldemar Torenstra, centre, gives failed asylum seekers the chance to win cash to spend after their deportation back to their countries of origin

The losers win 'consolation prizes' which include a bag of tulip bulbs and a bullet proof vest.

In the programme, called Weg van Nederland, or Far From the Netherlands, contestants are flanked by women dressed as air hostesses as they answer questions about Dutch culture, language and history.

Among the contestants on tonight's pilot show on the VPRO channel is an aeronautical engineer set to be deported to Cameroon and a Slavic languages student who will be sent home to Chechnya.

VPRO editor-in-chief Frank Wiering said he was 'pretty unenthusiatic' when production house Sky High first pitched the quiz.

He added: 'My first reaction was that this was a terrible idea.

'But then I realised the show was not really mocking asylum seekers but highlighting their plight through humour.

'The candidates are not actors, they are genuine unsuccessful asylum seekers who have to leave this country within a month or two.

'The show focuses attention on the fact that these days many asylum seekers being expelled have children who know nothing about their country of origin.

'They have had a good education, speak perfect Dutch and have only seen their country of birth on television. We believe it's time to stop and think about this.'

Tasteless? The programme is a commentary on Dutch immigration policies

Holland's Refugee Support Group spokesman Wouter van Zandwijk said he could understand why many people might find the show 'tasteless'.

He added: 'The programme is sick but, let's face it, the reality is sick too.

'Often our government invests in the education and integration of immigrant children, then just as we are about to harvest that investment and they all become hardworking Dutch taxpayers, they are sent away.'

TV viewers at home can also play the quiz online, with a top prize of a return ticket to the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao.
