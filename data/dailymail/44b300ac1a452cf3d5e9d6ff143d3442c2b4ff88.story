Having bad sex is one thing, but writing badly about it has to be even worse for a novelist.

Some of the world's greatest writers have produced cringeworthy stuff over the years when describing the act of lovemaking in their prose, and Australian writer Richard Flanagan is the latest culprit.

His literary mix of body circumnavigation, knicker elastic, a howling dog and a dying fairy penguin in his latest novel has now put him in line for an award that pays tribute to 'poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description'.

Australian writer Richard Flanagan has been nominated for the Bad Sex in Fiction award

Mr Flanagan's masterpiece of love and death during the construction of the Burma Railway, The Narrow Road to the Deep North, may have won the 2014 Booker Prize, but it has also been short-listed for something not so well-regarded: London's Literary Review Bad Sex in Fiction award.

The offending passage from the book that gained his nomination describes his characters 'circumnavigation of each other' which is then rudely interrupted by howling of a drooling dog carrying a half dead fairy penguin in its mouth.

It's not the most romantic of images in reality. Written down, it doesn't come across much better.

'Whatever had held them apart, whatever had restrained their bodies before, was now gone,' Mr Flanagan writes. 'If the earth spun it faltered, if the wind blew it waited. Hands found flesh; flesh, flesh.

'He felt the improbable weight of her eyelash with his own; he kissed the slight, rose-coloured trench that remained from her knicker elastic, running around her belly like the equator line circling the world. As they lost themselves in the circumnavigation of each other, there came from nearby shrill shrieks that ended in a deeper howl.

'Dorrigo looked up. A large dog stood at the top of the dune. Above blood-jagged drool, its slobbery mouth clutched a twitching fairy penguin.'

If he wins Mr Flanagan will join the likes of Sebastian Faulks, Norman Mailer and A.A. Gill

Established by Auberon Waugh in 1993, the purpose of the prize is to draw attention to poorly written, perfunctory or redundant passages of sexual description in modern fiction, and to discourage them, and is not intended to cover pornographic or expressly erotic literature.

But Mr Flanagan is in esteemed company as the likes of Sebastian Faulks, Norman Mailer and A.A. Gill are previous winners of the dubious award.

He'll be up against tough competition, however. Pulitzer prize-winning author Michael Cunningham is a front-runner for his description of a male climax.

'He lives for seconds in that soaring agonising perfection. It's this, only this, he's lost to himself, he's no one, he's obliterated, there's no Tyler at all, there's only… He hears himself gasp in wonder,' writes Mr Cunningham in his novel The Snow Queen.

Mr Flanagan's masterpiece of love and death during the construction of the Burma Railway, The Narrow Road to the Deep North, won the 2014 Booker Prize. Now he's in line for not so admirable an accolade 

Not to be outdone, Haruki Murakami gets his creative juices flowing, as well as a few others, in his best seller, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage, where he compares the movement of torsos as like drawing a complex diagram in the air, and describes two young women's pubic hair 'as wet as a rain forest'.
