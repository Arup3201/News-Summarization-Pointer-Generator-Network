Rio Ferdinand has agreed a deal to sign for newly promoted Queens Park Rangers.

The 35-year-old has been persuaded to take a massive drop in wages after hearing Harry Redknapp’s plans for how he can help the London club on their return to the Premier League.

It is believed his salary is less than a third of his £200,000-a-week salary at Manchester United. Ferdinand has also turned down a lucrative media career, with both BT and the BBC keen to land him. 'He just wants to play,' said a friend. 

Ferdinand is expected to return to London from the |World Cup in Brazil to complete the transfer soon.

The deal is expected to be confirmed by the club in the next 24 hours and comes as a huge boost for QPR after winning promotion through the play-offs.

Ferdinand, currently working for the BBC in Brazil, is a free agent after being released by Manchester United following 12 years at Old Trafford.

He recently confirmed he had offers from clubs both in England and abroad, but it is the chance to be reunited with Redknapp that has come out on top.

The 67-year-old was the manager who gave him his debut at West Ham in 1996, helping him develop into the world’s most expensive defender when he left to join Leeds in an £18million transfer five years later.

He has proven his determination to be fit for the new season by taking his his own personal trainer with him to Brazil.

He has been convinced he can enjoy a new challenge after speaking to Dutch legend Ruud Gullit.

He revealed: ‘He told me the couple of years he had at Chelsea were some of the most enjoyable of his career because there wasn’t at that time the pressure of trying to win trophies.’
