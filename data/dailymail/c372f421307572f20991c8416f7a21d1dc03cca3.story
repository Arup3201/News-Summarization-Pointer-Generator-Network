WENT THE DAY WELL? WITNESSING WATERLOO

by David Crane 

(William Collins, £20)

We know that it was not until Wednesday, June 21, 1815, three days after almost 200,000 men had clashed in the dreary fields of modern-day Belgium, that news of the Battle of Waterloo reached London.

The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, was dining with friends when the exhausted figure of Major Henry Percy burst in, carrying two captured French imperial eagle standards.

Liverpool immediately insisted on going to see the Prince Regent, the future George IV, who was also dining nearby. The Prince was naturally delighted, but hoped that ‘we have not suffered much loss’.

Went The Day Well? Witnessing Waterloo by David Crane

‘The loss has been very great indeed,’ said Major Percy sadly. The Prince promptly burst into tears.

The Battle of Waterloo is one of the great narrative set pieces in our entire history.

The details are irresistible: Napoleon’s flight from Elba; the British officers dancing in Brussels; the French emperor’s arrogant confidence; Wellington’s grim determination; the gruelling clash in the Belgian mud; the final charge of the French Imperial Guard; the last-gasp, Hollywood-style intervention of Marshal Blücher’s Prussians.

But it is a familiar story, which historians have told over and over again. How refreshing it is, then, to read David Crane’s magnificent book, by far the most enjoyable account of the battle I have ever encountered.

Most military histories are a bit like football books, bogged down in the detail of groin strains and offside decisions — or rather, troop dispositions and artillery mechanics — without ever managing to make you care.

But Crane has had the brilliant idea of interweaving a fast, colourful narrative of the battle with the story of what was happening in Britain that drizzly Sunday, June 18. His book is not just a military history; it is a social and cultural panorama, taking in everything from murderers and vicars to portrait-painters and prize-fighters.

In his introduction, he compares it with Bruegel’s famous painting The Fall Of Icarus, in which the painter’s stolid labourers plough in the foreground while Icarus plunges to his death far in the distance. But in a sense he is selling himself short, because his book is much more entertaining than that sounds.

Much of the action takes place hundreds of miles from Waterloo. We meet an extraordinary range of cultural superstars, from the talented but troubled writer Mary Lamb, who stabbed her mother to death during a bout of madness, to the pamphleteer William Hazlitt, the ancestor of today’s newspaper columnists, who claimed that ‘a man must be a good hater’.

But Crane also plunges us deep into Regency London, ‘a world of prize-fighting, carriage-racing, bull-baiting, mail-coach driving, badger-drowning and the great clown Grimaldi’.

As his characters move through the day, from the early hours to midnight, Crane gently cranks up the tension. Even as the armies are preparing for battle, he whisks us off to the Scottish isle of Harris, where a poor teenage mother is abandoning her stillborn child by the road.

As Wellington’s men take up their positions, Crane takes us to Altrincham, where children are gathering for their weekly Sunday school class.

A s the bullets are flying and thousands of men are drowning in their own blood, the narrative switches to Arundel Castle, where day-trippers have come to watch a jousting tournament to mark the 600th anniversary of Magna Carta.

All the time there is the almost unbearable sense that everybody is waiting — waiting for news of the battle that they know will decide the Napoleonic Wars.

Crane makes a persuasive case that this long struggle, just like the world wars of the 20th century, was a ‘total war’.

For two decades, the struggle against the French had been the defining issue of our national life. Little wonder the tension hung heavy that Sunday.

In one of countless beautifully observed moments, Crane describes the great moral reformer and anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce, leading his children to church. ‘Perhaps at this very moment,’ Wilberforce said to them as they walked, ‘when we are walking thus in peace together to the House of God, our brave fellows may be fighting hard in Belgium. Oh how grateful we should be for all God’s goodness to us!’

We know that it was not until Wednesday, June 21, 1815, three days after almost 200,000 men had clashed in the dreary fields of modern-day Belgium, that news of the Battle of Waterloo reached London

Against this background, the suffering of Wellington’s men is all the more striking.

Crane has a superb eye for fascinating little nuggets, such as the fact that nobody at the battle knew what time it was, since in those pre-railway timetable days, even those men who wore watches had them all set slightly differently. But he is also very good at the blood and guts. One memorable passage describes the last moments of the boxer Jack Shaw — then, Crane thinks, the most famous soldier in the army — who, steaming with pre-match booze, smashed a French officer’s head in two with his sword, bashed two more opponents’ brains out and was finally cornered against a wall by a great mob of Frenchmen.

Another describes the extraordinary stoicism of Wellington’s cavalry commander Lord Uxbridge, whose leg was shot away and had to be amputated on the field of battle. There was no anaesthetic in those days, but Uxbridge remained remarkably jolly even as the doctor was beginning to slice away.

At one stage, the saw got stuck in the bone. ‘Damn the saw!’ said the doctor, at which Uxbridge, said cheerfully: ‘What is the matter?’

The real heroes of Crane’s book, though, are the ordinary, nameless soldiers, the men from Aberystwyth and Aberdeen, Warrington and Wolverhampton, who gave their lives to bring down Napoleon’s empire.

One lovely story says it all. A few days before the battle, Wellington met Thomas Creevy, a visiting British politician, in the park in Brussels. Creevy asked if Napoleon could be beaten. At that, Wellington pointed to a small figure in the distance: a British infantryman in his red coat, peering at the park’s statues.

‘There,’ the great man said. ‘There, it all depends upon that article whether we do the business or not. Give me enough of it, and I am sure.’

And he was, of course, magnificently right.
