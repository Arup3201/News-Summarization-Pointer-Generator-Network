Wiping a tear from his eye, these pictures show how an emotional Prince Philip today laid a cross to honour Britain's war dead as he officially opened the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey.

The Duke of Edinburgh was invited to lay a remembrance cross in front of two wooden crosses from the graves of unknown British soldiers by Royal British Legion Poppy Factory president Sara Jones.

The 91-year-old - who was greeted by the Dean of Westminster John Hall and St Margaret’s Church rector Canon Andrew Tremlett - laid the cross in front of the First and Second World War graves.

The Last Post was sounded from the parapet of St Margaret’s Church by two trumpeters of the Household Cavalry before Mrs Jones read the Ode of Remembrance.

She lost her husband Lieutenant Colonel Herbert ‘H’ Jones in the Falklands War. Mrs Jones's reading was then followed by a two minute silence.

The Duke then spoke with war veterans, British Legion members and current servicemen, including Lance Corporal Watchman V, the mascot for the Staffordshire Regiment Association.

Aged only three, this is the third time the Staffordshire bull terrier has met the Duke at the Field of Remembrance.

His handler W2 Hedges, from 4th 
Battalion Mercian Regiment, said: ‘The first year the Duke met him he 
feigned horror - there was a good photograph of that.

‘The second year he patted his head. 
This year he said: “Oh, you’re back again”. The only royal he hasn’t met
so far is the Queen.

‘He met Charles and Camilla and gave Camilla a kiss - that was another great photograph. A lot of royal protection leaped forward.’

Lawrence Bohana, 72, who served with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, Welsh Regiment for 35 years, said: ‘It’s absolutely wonderful Philip still gives the time to come round and do this.

’It’s quite an honour - we’re fiercely loyal to the old chap. We’re extremely lucky in this country to have a royal family with such close ties to the services.

'It makes us servicemen fiercely proud of them.’

The Duke of Edinburgh wore Royal Navy ceremonial day dress (Admiral of the Fleet) - with no sword or medals - and an overcoat.

The first Field of Remembrance was held in the grounds of Westminster Abbey in November 1928, making 2012 the 84th year. Remembrance Sunday will be held on November 11 this year.
