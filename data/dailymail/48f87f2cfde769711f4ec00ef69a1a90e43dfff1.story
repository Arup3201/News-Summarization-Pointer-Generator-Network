A diabetic businessman had to have part of his leg amputated after being told a serious infection was athlete's foot.

Bob Wareham, 54, had to wait for more than a week to see specialists after the initial consultation mistook the diabetic foot infection for athlete's foot - a mistake which cost him part of his right leg.

Mr Wareham, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, has now won a pay out of £750,000 following a three-year legal battle which ended in an out-of-court settlement.

Misdiagnosis: Diabetic businessman Bob Wareham was told he had athlete's foot when he visited medics with a serious infection

His ordeal began when he suffered a foot infection in August 2008.

He was prescribed antibiotics for athlete's foot by an out-of-hours GP service based next to Weston General Hospital, but was forced to return to the A&E department two days later.

It was during this visit when he discovered he in fact had the diabetic foot infection.

But he was still not immediately admitted or referred - an absolute necessity, according to National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines.

The problem continued to worsen and Mr Wareham went back to the hospital three days later, when he was admitted but had to wait three more days before being seen by a multi-disciplinary specialist team.

But by then it was too late and devastated Mr Wareham had to have part of his right leg amputated at Bristol Royal Infirmary, leaving him with about six inches of leg below the right knee.

He said: 'I am faced for the rest of my life with the situation where I have to cope with an amputation through no fault of my own.

'The payout is at the top end of £750,000.

Emergency: Mr Wareham had to visit the A&E department at Weston General Hospital two days after the original misdiagnosis

'But I am a businessman and my time in hospital cost me all my businesses, so there is an element of compensation for that.

'It also has to pay for my future care.'

Mr Wareham launched a three-and-a-half year legal battle through his solicitors before the case was settled out-of-court in June.

He said: 'With a diabetic person's infection, time is the ultimate factor.

'It has happened now and at least they have been brought to account.

'But, having said that, that's not going to bring my leg back.'

Solicitor Justin Goodman said: 'Mr Wareham was awarded a substantial payout as a result of clinical negligence by the out-of-hours general practitioner and the accident and emergency department of Weston General Hospital.

'On every occasion Mr Wareham attended 
the out-of-hours GP and the accident and emergency department of Weston 
General Hospital, he should have been referred for surgical opinion by 
an appropriately experienced surgeon who deals with diabetic foot 
infections.

'Had he been referred, he would not have undergone an amputation.'

Mr Wareham added: 'It's been a very long and stressful three-and-a-half years to get justice for my mistreatment.

'I can only hope that lessons will be learned from the failures and new or revised procedures will be introduced to avoid a repeat of the mistakes and errors, which led to my unnecessary amputation.'

Weston General Hospital and NHS Ligitation Authority both refused to comment last night.
