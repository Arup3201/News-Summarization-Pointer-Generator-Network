Apologies: Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the criticisms prompted 'deep reflection' and persuaded the company to change its repair policies

Apple has apologised to Chinese consumers following government media attacks on its repair policies.

A statement posted by Apple in Chinese on its website said the complaints had prompted 'deep reflection' and persuaded the company of the need to revamp its repair policies, boost communication with Chinese consumers and strengthen oversight of authorised resellers.

State broadcaster China Central Television and the ruling party's flagship newspaper, People's Daily, had led the charge against the American company.

They accused Apple of arrogance, greed and 'throwing its weight around' and portrayed it as the latest Western company to exploit the Chinese consumer.

The attacks prompted some internet users and consumers to deride the broadcaster.

Apple has now responded to the attacks with an apology from chief executive Tim Cook.

'We've come to understand through this process that because of our poor communication, some have come to feel that Apple's attitude is arrogant and that we don't care about or value feedback from the consumer,' his Chinese statement said.

'For the concerns and misunderstandings passed on to the consumer, we express our sincere apologies.'

The People's Daily newspaper ran an editorial last Wednesday headlined: 'Strike down Apple's incomparable arrogance.'

It wrote: 'Here we have the Western person's sense of superiority making mischief.

'If there's no risk in offending the Chinese consumer, and it also makes for lower overheads, then why not?'

Chinese observers accused People's Daily of hypocrisy and pointed out the newspaper had remained silent when Chinese companies were implicated over food safety, pollution and other scandals.

Complaints by celebrities on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, accompanied the broadcast by CCTV.

Popular business magazine Caijing said its readers identified a long list of abusers, including state banks that lend to those with political connections while leaving ordinary savers with low rates on deposits.

Despite the government's pressures, sales of Apple products in the region, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, grew 67 per cent to $6.8billion - Â£4.5billion - in the first three months of 2013, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the company.

Apple sold 2million iPhone 5s during the first weekend it was available in China, in December.

The region is Apple's third largest market, accounting for 13 per cent of all sales last year. More than 17,000 outlets sell its products in mainland China, a figure that includes 11 Apple stores and 400 premium resellers.

Changes: Apple has now extended the warranty of any iPhone 4 or 4S in China which has been repaired in the last year

In January, Mr Cook said he expected China to replace North America as its largest source of revenue in the foreseeable future.

The attacks on Apple centre on complaints over Apple's repair policies in China - specifically its practice of only replacing faulty parts rather than providing new iPhones, as it does in other markets.

Critics say that allows Apple to avoid having to extend its service warranty by another year.

According to the Financial Times, Apple has extended the warranty of any iPhone 4 or 4S which has been repaired in the last year. This service is not on offer elsewhere.
