These haunting pictures reveal the abandoned Catholic home which was once a scene of horror where young boys were beaten and raped.

St Edward's Boys Home in Coleshill, Warwickshire, was where Father Eric Taylor committed indecent assault and buggery on the children.

He was found guilty of 16 offences between 1957 and 1965 and jailed in 1998. The home was closed soon after, and Taylor died in prison in 2001.

The organisation was estimated to have paid more than £500,000 in out-of-court settlements, but it did not admit liability in the legal claims.

Pope John Paul II removed Taylor from the priesthood in 2001 in what was said to have been the first intervention of its type by the pontiff in Britain.
