'Disgusting': Daniel Orrell is trying to make up for urinating on a war memorial in Bolton by selling poppies at his local Asda

A thoughtless reveller who drunkenly urinated on a war memorial is trying to atone for his crime by selling poppies for the Royal British Legion.

Daniel Orrell pleaded guilty to outraging public decency when he committed the 'disgusting' act in Nelson Square, Bolton, on July 27.

A judge labelled his actions 'despicable' and the case sparked public outrage.

The 24-year-old now wants to put things right and is participating in collections with Legion members for the Poppy Appeal, in the weeks leading up to Remembrance Sunday.

Orrell, who has been selling poppies at Asda in Burnden, Bolton, said: 'I put myself forward because I really wanted to show how sorry I was.

'It's important to me that I clear my name in any way that I can. Nothing can change what I did, so I wanted to do this on behalf of myself and my family.

'The Royal Legion members I have been out and about with have been so supportive of me, they're really forgiving of what I have done.'

Police on foot patrol in Bolton town centre found Orrell at just after 1am on 27 July, close to the memorial in Nelson Square. Officers could see his trousers were undone and a 'large volume of urine running down the stone wall' of the memorial.

At the time of the offence, The Bolton 
News reported that chairman of the bench at Bolton Magistrates Court, 
Norman Morlidge, branded Orrell's actions 'despicable'

He
 said: 'To urinate in a public place is an offence in that it offends 
people. However, to do it on a war memorial is incredibly offensive to 
all those veterans who gave their lives for this country.'

He was fined £250 and ordered to pay £85 court costs.

'Not been out': Orrell says he hasn't been to the town centre since last July and he says urinating against the war memorial was 'the worst decision'

Following Orrell's shameful actions, there was a public outcry with people taking to the internet to slam him for what he did - something he said he completely understands.

He said: 'This was the worst decision I have ever made and I completely get why people feel the way they do. The memorial represents the people who sacrificied themselves for others and it's been a really big learning curve for me.

'I have been congratulated on what I'm doing and welcomed into the Legion, which means so much to me.'

Orrell, who works in Salford Quays, has admitted to being drunk when he committed the offence.

'I've got to take responsibility and learn from this, learn to know my limits,' he added.

He has not been out into Bolton town centre since the incident.

After Orrell was sentenced, the Royal British Legion branded his actions 'disgusting' but they are now helping him make amends.

Orrell contacted the Bolton branch of the Royal British Legion and volunteered to help out as part of the Poppy Appeal, which supports members of the Armed Forces and their families.

He said: 'I was talking with my dad about what I could do and when we thought of working with the legion it made complete sense.

Welcomed: The Royal British Legion originally branded his actions 'disgusting' but are now calling the decision to sell poppies for them 'brave'

'I'm not saying it will make up for what I have done, but hopefully it's a start and I will be able to do more things in the future.'

And his willingness to atone for his error has been welcomed by members of the Royal British Legion in Bolton.

Chairman Glynnis Knapman said: 'This is a very positive move and it shows that Daniel knows that what he did was wrong. Maybe he didn't realise what he was doing at the time.

'It is brave to put himself back out there.'

Orrell added: 'I'm fitting in as many days I can volunteer as possible, as much as I can do I will.'

Greater Manchester Police heard about his idea on Twitter and have helped to organise the initiative.

PC Carol Winrow, of Farnworth police, said: 'We are keen to promote the idea of restorative justice and, when we saw the negative reaction that Daniel was getting on Twitter, we thought this would be a good idea - but he had already contacted the Royal British Legion himself, so we helped facilitate the day.'
