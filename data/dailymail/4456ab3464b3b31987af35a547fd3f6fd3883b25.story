Two Northern California men accused of sexually abusing a 15-year-old girl and keeping her captive in a metal box on their marijuana farm, have pleaded not guilty to federal drug charges.

Ryan Balletto, 30, and Patrick Pearmain, 24, were shackled and wearing jail garb when they denied the charges today in a San Francisco federal court.

Federal prosecutors have charged Balletto and Pearmain with growing more than 1,000 marijuana plants on a remote Lake County farm.

Captors: 30-year-old Ryan Balletto, left, and 25-year-old Patrick Pearmain, right, were arrested in May after the girl they kidnapped called police, and authorities traced the call to a motel in Sacramento

Both are also charged with coercing the teenage runaway to help with their alleged operation.

Balletto denied the charges even though federal prosecutors allege in court documents that he confessed.

His lawyer denied comment after the hearing.

At Balletto's pot farm, officers 
found 'equipment consistent with sexual bondage and sadomasochism,' 
including a rack 'presumably used to attach a human to the device and 
immobilize them.' Near the rack officers found a towel with blood 
stains.

Prosecutors had said earlier that Balletto confessed, according to court 
documents arguing Balletto and Pearmain should remain behind bars during
the case.

'The 
government... has a recorded, Mirandized confession by Balletto, a 
recorded statement from the minor victim, and multiple recorded 
statements from others who were working on the grow site,' prosecutors 
wrote.

Authorities in Lake 
County learned about the case when the Los Angeles Police Department 
advised that Balletto might have kidnapped her.

Deputies
visited Balletto's home asking about the missing girl April 29, the 
complaint said, and she called authorities the next day to say she was 
OK and in Sacramento.

LAPD 
investigators traced the call and police located the girl at a West 
Sacramento hotel, where authorities arrested Pearmain, the complaint 
said.

The girl, described as a runaway from the Los Angeles area, told investigators she was locked in a 4-by-2-by-2-foot box.

Kidnapped: A girl who went missing in April in Los Angeles ended up being used as a sex slave on a marijuana farm in Northern California until she was rescued on May 1

Prisoner: Balletto and Pearmain kept the girl locked in a 4-foot by 2-foot metal toolbox, sometimes for days at a time

Holes
had been drilled in the box, and water was run through the box, held at
an angle, to wash her without letting her out, the complaint said.

Investigators found human hair inside the box, where prosecutors said the girl was imprisoned 'on multiple occasions, for days.'

A
message left Friday morning for Balletto's attorney, Jodi Linker of the
Office of the Federal Public Defender, was not immediately returned. 
Pearmain's lawyer, Robert Waggener, also did not return a call.

Hundreds
of marijuana plants and several firearms, including AR-15-style assault
rifles and body armor were found as part of the investigation.

Prosecutors described Balletto as an ex-Marine who was preparing for an extended battle.

'The
presence of so many weapons on the grow site, including two assault 
rifles and eleven loaded 20- and 30-round magazines ... indicate that 
Balletto was prepared to engage in an extended gun battle,' prosecutors 
wrote.

The two men face charges of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute more than 1,000 marijuana plants.

Trooper: According to the criminal complaint, Balletto called the girl a 'trooper' for not screaming in the box

Horde: Police found a huge arsenal of weapons during a raid on the growing operation and Balletto's home

Girlfriend arrested: Balletto's girlfriend Christa McConnell was also arrested. She faces child endangerment charges for leaving loaded weapons within reach of her five children

In
addition, Pearmain faces charges of kidnapping to commit robbery or 
rape and unlawful sex with a minor and Balletto faces charges of lewd 
and lascivious acts with a child.

Balletto's girlfriend, 27-year-old Christa McConnell, was also arrested during the raid on the home.

McConnell
has five children with Balletto, according to the criminal complaint. 
During their raid they found a 7-month-old baby sleeping on the master 
bed with a loaded gun only two-feet away from the headboard.

All
five children were placed in the custody of Lake County Child 
Protective Services. McConnell faces child-endangerment and weapons 
charges.

Last
year, Lake County had 87 cases of residents cultivating marijuana. 
According to public information releases posted on the Sheriff's Office 
website, police have already eradicated nearly 60,000 pot plants just 
this month.

'Some
in our community believe that marijuana grow operations are run by 
compassionate caregivers interested only in supplying medicine to the 
sick, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said in a written statement.

'Unfortunately,
this case illustrates what we in law enforcement see - marijuana grow 
operations that include heavily armed, violent individuals, motivated by
profit, carrying out abuse of vulnerable victims.'
