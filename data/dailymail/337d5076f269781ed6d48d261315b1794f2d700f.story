A Heavily-pregnant woman flew from her home in Nigeria to take advantage of the NHS by having her baby in Britain.

She had £10,000 of treatment but is understood to have returned to Nigeria with her baby without paying a penny.

The woman travelled 3,200 miles from Lagos to Manchester because she was worried about the standard of care in her own country and thought she would  be in safer hands.

On arrival she went straight to Wythenshawe Hospital where she told doctors that there were complications with her pregnancy.

Two midwives, two urology consultants, a radiology consultant, two obstetric consultants and  two anaesthetists attended her in the delivery room before her healthy baby was born by emergency Caesarean section on Wednesday of last week.

Before she was discharged on Monday, hospital staff sought billing details for the woman and told her the cost of the treatment was around £10,000. However, she is not thought to have paid anything.

Last night MPs called for an inquiry and accused the unnamed woman  of ‘effectively stealing’ from the British taxpayer.

The
Government said it hoped new measures would tackle ‘health tourists’ 
who fly to Britain to take advantage of the world-renowned NHS.

Health minister Simon Burns said: ‘We won’t tolerate abuse of our health service. The NHS has a duty to anyone whose life or long-term health is at immediate risk but it is not there to serve the health needs of the globe.’

Hospitals are allowed to bill non-EU patients who travel from their home countries to the UK for medical treatment on the NHS.

But health sources say that in  reality patients often return to their homeland without paying and the debts are then almost impossible  to recover.

The Harvard-educated woman flew to Manchester Airport and went directly to Wythenshawe Hospital.

It is believed she chose the well-respected university hospital because she knew it had a maternity unit and was less than two miles from the airport.

On arrival she told doctors she had undergone an ultrasound scan in Nigeria which revealed complications with her pregnancy which suggested a Caesarean was advisable.

Nigeria offers free maternity treatment but the quality of the care  is very poor and there is a high mortality rate. A woman there has a one in 13 chance of dying during pregnancy or childbirth, according to recent statistics.

Her baby was born at Wythenshawe without complication.

Mr Burns said: ‘There are comprehensive rules and procedures to charge visitors for hospital treatment but we know that the system needs to be improved.

Curiously the woman was educated at elite Harvard University in America

‘That is why we are currently 
reviewing those arrangements to prevent inappropriate free access to the
NHS and provide a fairer more balanced system. Hospitals have a legal 
duty to recover any charges made to overseas patients.’

Shadow
Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘We need a full inquiry into the 
circumstances and how the hospital has been left in this position. There
are clear rules about health tourism and the NHS must be able to 
recover its costs.’

Graham 
Stringer, Labour MP for the Manchester seat of Blackley and Broughton, 
added: ‘This is simply a foreigner choosing to effectively steal off the
NHS and the Government should use whatever powers it has to get the 
money back.’

University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust – which runs Wythenshawe – is short of funds and is having to cut £17.5million this year.

The hospital has a dedicated team who pursue payment by invoicing patients, but once they leave the UK the hospitals are almost powerless to act.

However hospitals can inform the UK Border Agency and repeat entry into the UK by visa may be withheld until the bill is settled.

A hospital spokesman said: ‘If a patient is a non-UK resident and treatment is considered necessary  or urgent then it would never  be withheld.

‘In regards to reclaiming costs from non-UK residents who use our services, we adhere to guidelines issued by the Department of Health.’

Figures revealed by Wythenshawe Hospital showed the number of non-EU patients treated rose from 78 in 2008/09 to 133 in 2011/12.

Bimbo Ayelabola: Five babies

Nigerian-born Bimbo Ayelabola, 33, travelled to Britain to give birth to quins at a cost of up to £200,000 to British taxpayers.

The wife of a wealthy businessman had two boys and three girls by Caesarean section in April last year and was in Homerton Hospital, East London, for almost two weeks.

Mrs Ayelabola, from Lagos, who had been taking a fertility drug, said at the time: ‘I had already had miscarriages and couldn’t bear the stress another pregnancy would cause. So I decided to visit my family in London.

‘I thought I would stand a much better chance of avoiding another miscarriage in a calmer place with friends and family.’

Mrs Ayelabola claimed her husband left her and returned to Nigeria after discovering she had given birth to five babies. She was given a visa to stay in Britain which runs out in December of this year.

Health tourism is thought to cost the NHS up to £200million  a year.

Patients who have lived in the UK for a year get all their NHS treatment free. And emergency care at A&E and walk-in clinics is completely free for anyone.

For EU residents, their country covers the cost of other treatment. Non-EU residents get a bill.

Urgent but non-emergency treatment such as maternity care is provided regardless of residence status or ability to pay, but hospitals must take steps to recover debts.

Non-urgent treatment for chargeable overseas visitors is not supposed to go ahead without full payment.
