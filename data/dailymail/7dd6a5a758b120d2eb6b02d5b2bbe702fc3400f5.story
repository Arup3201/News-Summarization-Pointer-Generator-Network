Some of Britain’s best hospitals are to set up outposts in China and the Middle East to generate more cash for the NHS.

Great Ormond Street and the Royal Marsden are among those expected to build centres around the world, spreading their expertise in paediatrics and cancer care and generating much-needed income.

The Health Service is hoping to capitalise on the publicity from Danny Boyle’s depiction of the NHS in the Olympics opening ceremony – watched by an estimated one billion worldwide – by launching a major push to win contracts with foreign health services.

The Department of Health and UK Trade and Investment, the business wing of the Foreign Office, are setting up an organisation called Healthcare UK to promote NHS brands, as well as private healthcare firms such as Bupa and drug companies including GlaxoSmithKline.

Others being touted for business include the Moorfields Eye Hospital, Stoke Mandeville Hospital, world famous for its spinal injuries unit, and Imperial College Hospital, which is a world leader in robotic surgery.

Some NHS trusts already attract paying patients from around the world. But health chiefs think they can provide a world-class service closer to their homes.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and even Libya – where the post-Gaddafi regime is rebuilding the health service – are also thought to be prime targets for the new hospitals.

Expanding: Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London is one of the institutions looking to build centres around the world

Making the most of a golden opportunity: The Royal Marsden Hospital, a specialist cancer treatment facility in London, is another organisation looking to expand

NHS Trusts will supply staff and expertise and train up local doctors and administrators to run a franchise operation.

Already
 Moorfields Eye Hospital runs a Dubai outpost while Imperial has two 
successful diabetes centres in Abu Dhabi. And senior managers from South
 East Coast Ambulance Trust recently visited Libya.

Healthcare UK will seek to expand the opportunities for NHS trusts, as well as leading healthcare firms, and promote them in a co-ordinated way.

A prospectus for foreign clients boasts: ‘The combined strengths of the NHS and industry make the UK a source of valuable experience and expertise and an ideal partner for overseas healthcare providers.’

Chinese officials have already told Health Secretary Andrew Lansley they admire his restructuring of the NHS and are keen to co-operate.

Shaking some moves: A lot of the nurses featured in the Opening Ceremony actually work for the NHS

Success story: The Opening Ceremony was a big hit around the world

Health minister Anne Milton said: ‘The NHS has a world-class reputation, and this exciting development will make the most of that to deliver real benefits for both patients and taxpayers.’

Under the plans NHS Foundation Trusts will be allowed to plough profits from private operations into building franchise outlets abroad. Taxpayers’ cash will not be used.

Officials also envisage some NHS Trusts would decide to join forces with private companies who could provide the initial capital to build overseas hospitals and they would then take on the financial risk.

UKTI hopes the initiative will also allow  medical technology firms to sell their products abroad, generating valuable income for the UK.

The Department of Health insists no project will get the green light if it hurts patient care in the UK.

A spokesman said: ‘Under no circumstances will the quality or extent of NHS services be compromised by the sharing of NHS expertise abroad.

‘If anything the reverse will be true, as NHS Trusts will benefit from increased income which will benefit services to patients.’
