A brave 9-year-old Florida boy who was bitten by a shark and nearly drowned Friday is already saying he plans to surf again.

And soon. The North Palm Beach third grader received 80 stitches but planes to get right back in the water as soon as they com out in a week.

'He’s doing great. He loves the water,' said his dad David Cozzan. 'He’s a kid. They recover fast.'

Horrifying: 9-year-old Florida boy Sebastian Cozzan was nearly dragged away to his death by a shark on Friday after being in the ocean for just moments

Brave: Cozzan would require 80 stitches, but you'd never know it to hear him descibe the encounter

Sebastian's brush with death happened after a day out kayaking with his mom and brother.

He begged for just two minutes of surfing time before they headed home. His mom agreed, but soon regretted it.

'The shark came up, bit me, then it started to drown me,' a calm and totally collected Sebastian told WPBF.

Instead of letting himself be done in by the beast, Sebastian fought back.

'It didn't really hurt too much': Cozzan has been on crutches since the incident on Friday but he's eager to get back into the water

Healing nicely: Cozzan's wounds are healing nicely and he's prepared to surf again as soon as the stitches come out in a week

'I just kicked the shark inside the mouth and he just got hurt I think,' Sebastian said.

The shark thankfully took the hint and swam away.

David Cozzan was impressed with his son's bravery, not least of all because he himself has been the victim of a shark attack.

'The bite wasn’t close to the extent of the bite my son received. I did not require any stitches,' said his proud dad.
