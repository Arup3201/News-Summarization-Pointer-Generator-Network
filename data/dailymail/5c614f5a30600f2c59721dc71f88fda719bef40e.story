The neighbours of a dead teenage girl who mysteriously vanished while babysitting for them have finally been charged over her death.

Couple Eric and Dea Millerberg were long suspected in the death of 16-year-old Alexis Rasmussen who was discovered in a shallow grave in October six weeks after disappearing.

Alexis of North Ogden, Utah died from a drug overdose, on September 10 before her body was dumped in a remote area of Morgan County.

Prosecutors say the teenager was having a 'relationship' with 36-year-old Mr Millerberg that involved him supplying her with drugs reports KSL 5 News.

Mr Millerberg is charged with first-degree child abuse homicide as well as obstructing justice, unlawful sexual activity with a minor and abuse or desecration of a dead body, reports KSL.

His wife faces a charge of abuse or desecration of a body.

Of the homicide charge against Mr Millerberg, Weber County Attorney Dee Smith said: 'The evidence does not suggest that this was an intentional act to cause her death,' according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

But explained that a child abuse homicide charge can be filed even if the intent of the defendant wasn't to cause death but acted 'recklessly in the course of committing child abuse', the charge is warranted.

'Our view is, providing and 
administering certain controlled substances to a minor in the way they 
were administered in this case results in an act of child abuse,'  he said, reported KSL.

Search warrants have alleged the couple were supplying Alexis drugs in exchange for baby-sitting.

However, Smith refused to release details of what type of drugs killed the teen.

Smith described Mrs Millerberg’s involvement in Alexis’ death as 'minimal'.

She was 'relieved' that charges were filed, her attorney Michael Bouwhuis said in a statement, reports KSL.

'She has always maintained that she did not cause the death of Alexis Rasmussen, and this charge bears that out,' he said.

'She is very sorry about the untimely death of Alexis Rasmussen and sincerely hopes that the Rasmussen family will someday soon find healing and comfort.'

Alexis was last seen on September 10, 2011, when her family said she went to the home of the Millerberg's to baby-sit. Her body was found on October 18 near a river in Morgan County.

Sometime during the late hours of September 10 and early morning on September 11 inside the home, Alexis died of an overdose from drugs provided by Mr Millerberg, Smith said, reports KSL.

'In the months leading up to the disappearance of Alexis, she was heavily involved in narcotic use, specifically methamphetamine and prescription medication,'  a police report filed in November states.

North Ogden Police Chief Polo Afuvai told KSL that the charges had been a long time coming.

'We're hopeful that we can now move forward and see the case through the court system. We hope to give the family closure.'
Mr Millerberg is currently in prison for a drug-related probation violation.

Mrs Millerberg is due to appear in court
on May 24 on unrelated charges of falsely obtaining or dispensing a 
prescription and endangerment of a child or a vulnerable adult.
