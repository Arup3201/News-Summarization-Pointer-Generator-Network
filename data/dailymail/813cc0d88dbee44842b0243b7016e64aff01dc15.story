A suspected illegal immigrant held on to a motorhome axle for more than 100 miles along busy motorways in a desperate bid to reach Britain, it has been revealed.

Geoff and Christine Mullin were driving back home to Barry, South Wales when the discovery was made - having brought their vehicle through the Channel Tunnel from Calais.

The stowaway had been holding on to the underside of the motorhome while the couple travelled at speeds of up to 65mph.

As many as 2,000 migrants from Africa and Asia are encamped in and around Calais and increasingly desperate attempts are being made to flee to Britain

When they slowed for a traffic jam on the M25 near Cobham Services in Surrey, the man – believed to be of African appearance – jumped out from his hiding place and ran into a nearby field.

The incident, on Tuesday, happened in the same week that another stowaway was discovered hiding in a woman’s car as hundreds more tried to storm a ferry in the port of Calais.

The Sun reports that Mr and Mrs Mullin believe the man grabbed hold of the chassis while they were waiting at a pet passport control area in Calais.

He is reported as saying: ‘My mouth dropped. Shocked is an understatement. To think someone could be under your van.

Asylum seekers have been seen clambering over fences, climbing in to trucks and hiding in tourists' cars as they risk their lives attempting to reach Britain

‘He must have been getting tired - he probably didn't expect to have to hold on for that distance.'  

As many as 2,000 migrants from Africa and Asia are encamped in and around Calais and increasingly desperate attempts are being made to flee to Britain.

On Thursday, a man was arrested in Shepherdswell, Kent, on suspicion of being an illegal immigrant after he hid in the back of a woman's car as she travelled through the Eurotunnel.

Sue Taber, 59, called police after discovering a man hidden in her Fiat having driven from Spain to France and back to Britain.

Ms Taber was shocked to find a human leg protruding from out behind the driver's seat after parking up outside her home following the 53 mile cross-Channel journey.

She said she noticed the stranger as she let her two dogs out of the car and said the 5ft 8in man, aged between 18 and 20, emerged from her vehicle shouting: 'I'm an orphan, I'm an orphan'.

Ms Taber, who believes the man got into her car while she left it briefly unattended and unlocked at Calais, France, admitted she had felt something nudging her back on her journey, but assumed it was just one of her dogs fetching a ball. 

A day earlier, there were chaotic scenes as more than 250 immigrants stormed a Britain-bound P&O ferry.

They tried to force their way on board the vessel at Calais and security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on them as they attempted to overpower officials.

Cross-Channel travellers are now being warned to stay alert when travelling through the French port, where more than 80 police officers and 40 riot police have been drafted in as part of heightened patrols.

Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said today that the company's site at Calais was extremely secure but added: 'Everybody travelling through Calais should be vigilant whenever they leave their vehicle.'

The mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, has begged David Cameron to visit Calais to tell the waiting hordes that Britain was 'no El Dorado'.

France needs to 'get its act together' and deal with growing numbers of asylum seekers in Calais rather than blaming Britain, a former home secretary has insisted.

Lord Howard of Lympne said he had 'some sympathy' with the mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, amid increasingly desperate efforts by migrants to get into the UK.

But he said she was 'directing her frustration and her anger at the wrong target' by demanding that London 'take responsibility' and threatening to blockade the port.

'The general principle which every member state of the European Union has subscribed to is that refugees, people fleeing persecution, should apply for asylum in the first safe country they reach,' Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'France used to take this very seriously. 

When I was home secretary, which was quite a long time ago now, we had an agreement with France under which if people came to the UK from France and claimed asylum we returned them to France and France dealt with their claim. That is what really ought to happen.'

The Tory peer said the root issue was that France had 'lost control of its borders' after signing up to the Schengen agreement that 'dismantled' restrictions between countries.

He added that the previous French administration under president Nicolas Sarkozy had recognised that and threatened to withdraw from Schengen - which the UK never signed up to.

'The mayor of Calais ought to be directing her frustration at president (Francois) Hollande and getting him to take the kind of action that president Sarkozy was talking about,' Lord Howard said.

'We have control of our borders. But it is the countries of the Schengen agreement that ought to get their act together and deal with this problem. We have retained control of our borders, and it is about time members of the Schengen agreement did the same.'

Yesterday, a suspected illegal immigrant was found clinging to the underside of a caravan on the M20 in Kent – as two more were found hanging from underneath a mobile home. 

Police were first called to reports of a person clinging to the bottom of a caravan as it travelled along the M20 towards London at 9.16am.

Officers located the man hanging from the motorhome between junctions nine and eight, the section between Ashford and Maidstone in Kent, and arrested him at the scene. 

Then Kent Police found another two men clinging to the underside of a mobile home, they said yesterday.
