Partizan Belgrade head coach Marko Nikolic says his side have 'nothing to lose' against Tottenham when they kick off the Europa League group stage.

Mauricio Pochettino's side begin their Group C campaign on Thursday with a tough-looking match in Serbia against the 25-time national champions.

Partizan finished runners-up in the Serbian SuperLiga last term and began this season in the Champions League before being edged out on away goals in the third qualifying round by Ludogorets, who performed so impressively at Liverpool on Tuesday.

It has meant Crno-beli's attention has switched to the Europa League and head coach Nikolic says they approach the group stage opener with the pressure off given Spurs' star-studded line-up.

'Of course you have nothing to lose in this match,' the Partizan head coach said at the pre-match press conference.

'We managed to bring back a good competitive rhythm in the game with [Saturday's 4-2 league win against] Cukaricki and now we have the strongest possible opponents at the beginning of this competition, Tottenham.

'Partizan have partially fulfilled its goal by making the group stage, but I do not want to be mere participants. I want to try to compete at this level, to show how much power we have.

'We will not make big promises, but we will try to win this match as we do with every match.'

Partizan, unbeaten in all 11 matches this season, will be without Andrija Zivkovic and Darko Brasanac on Thursday through injury, while Peter Skuletic is banned after being sent off against Neftci in the play-offs.
