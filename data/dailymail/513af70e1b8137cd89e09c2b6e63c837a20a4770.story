Meet Pepper the pug - a dog who owes her life to Babygros and onesies after being born with a debilitating stretchy skin condition.

Pepper's skin is so fragile that it blisters and tears at the slightest touch, with the condition so severe that vets advised putting the dog down when she was just a few weeks old.

But devastated owner Nicola Galpin came up with the method of dressing her pug in the protective clothes to stop Pepper from rubbing and damaging her skin.

Pepper's skin is so fragile that it blisters and tears at the slightest touch, with vets advising Mrs Galpin to put the dog down when she was just a few weeks old

Pepper has a condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes her excessively stretchy skin to tear easily

The pampered dog's extensive wardrobe includes six Babygros, two cardigans, two coats and one Christmas jumper, which all provide the vital protection that keeps her alive.

Mrs Galpin, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, said: 'I love wrapping her up in clothes. She needs the protection because her skin is so weak but it makes me feel nice too. She looks absolutely adorable but it's also for her own good, it's kept her alive.

'The vets said she would probably tear her skin so often it would be kindest to put her down, but I couldn't give up on her and knew I would find a way to keep her safe.

'She has a lack of collagen in her body, meaning that she has nothing to hold her skin in place, but the Babygros really help her- it's amazing.'

Pepper has a condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which causes her excessively stretchy skin to tear easily. The condition can also affect humans.

Dogs suffering from the condition do not usually survive beyond their first few months, but at almost two years old, Pepper is still going strong. 

Most dogs with Pepper's condition do not live beyond a few months, but the dog is now two years old thanks to Mrs Galpin's idea of wearing protective clothing

However, Mrs Galpin was on the brink of giving up on her young puppy in Christmas 2013 when Pepper, just seven months old, needed an operation to repair her hips.

The 41-year-old said: 'Afterwards she had so many tears and holes in her body, the vet advised us to put her down but she was only a puppy and so full of love. We just couldn't do it.'

Today, Pepper is still going strong despite having to be checked for cuts on a regular basis. She is now 18 months old and is showing no signs of slowing down.

Mrs Galpin said: 'She doesn't even notice that there's anything wrong. She runs around like a maniac, is extremely playful and loves her life.

'In some positions she looks like she's wearing a hoodie because her skin hangs about two inches underneath her body and gathers all around her joints.

'Sometimes, she's got so much excess skin that you can wrap your hand in her like a glove.

'She's never in pain. She doesn't even notice any new cuts until she starts playfully licking them.'

The pug underwent an operation on her hips when she was seven months old but fortunately pulled through

Now Pepper is helping other dogs with the condition and has a Facebook page called 'My name is Pepper....Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome will not beat me!!'

Mrs Galpin said: 'People from all over the world have joined to get help and advice from her and me.

'Someone even sent me a medical ointment, called Equiade, that is usually used on horses, which we've found is really helpful for treating Pepper's wounds.

A spokesman for the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation said: 'Dogs show not only the same clinical and pathological features as humans with EDS but they also have the same problems with medical management.

'Dogs with EDS have skin and joint laxity that far exceeds that of any normal dog. Often, they have luxated hip joints but do not appear to have pain associated with it.

'Despite the shorter life expectancy, they are able to run and play like most other dogs.'
