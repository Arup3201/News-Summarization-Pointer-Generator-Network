Video evidence shows a 22-year-old college student who vanished on a night out last week entered the Mississippi River from a bridge shortly afterwards, police have revealed.

Authorities in Minneapolis are now searching the river for Jennifer Houle's body.

They are not declaring the case a suicide as her body has not yet been recovered, and any cause of death would be released by the Hennepin County medical examiner, they said.

But police said a video shows Houle alone on the 10th Avenue bridge before she entered the water in the early hours on Friday and no suspects are being sought in connection with the incident.

'We extend our deepest condolences to the Houle family and all of Jennifer's many friends,' the police said in a statement. 

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office is now conducting a search in the water, police said. The river is about 60 feet below the bridge.

Houle was last seen by her a friend inside a Dinkytown bar, Blarney Pub and Grill, between 1am and 2am on Friday, police said.

Houle's friend Brooke Laven told KSTP that they had gone bar-hopping on Thursday evening but that while they were out, they ran into one of Houle's ex-boyfriends.

'That kind of set off some emotions,' Laven told KSTP.

She said she had become separated from Houle in the bar and was unable to find her.

Laven said that Houle's purse and phone were found in the street near her apartment just a few blocks from the bar at 3am on Friday, suggesting she had tried to walk home.

But police told DailyMail.com that they believe she had already entered the water by the time the purse was found. 

KSTP reported that police spoke with the ex-boyfriend and multiple other individuals after she went missing.

According to the television station, Houle studied management at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and was a Phi Beta Phi sorority member.

On Sunday, hundreds of Houle's friends and relatives attended a vigil outside Stillwater Area High School, where she attended before college.

On Monday, her sorority sisters asked students to wear purple, Houle's favorite color.

'We need all the help we can get to find this warm-hearted, beautiful person,' it wrote on its Facebook page. 'If you have any information, please contact us or the Minneapolis police.'
