A California man gunned down his wife and two of her children in their home on Monday night before turning the gun on himself in what police believe was a murder-suicide.

Stepfather Ramon Miranda, 38, apparently shot and killed 34-year-old Silvia Miranda and her children, 12-year-old Ramon Jr. and 10-year-old Rayna, the San Bernardino County coroner's
office confirmed on Wednesday.

Neighbors reported hearing the Fontana, California family arguing before the violence broke out.

Neighbors in the quiet California neighborhood were shocked by the murders. Many said their children played with the boy and girl who were murdered

Silvia Miranda's oldest son, 16, had gone 
to the house to check on the family after he had failed to hear from 
them and found them all dead, authorities said.

He discovered his mother and siblings riddled with bullets. It was not clear how long they had been out of contact with the teen.

The stepfather was found dead with a single gunshot wound to the 
head, police believe he killed himself.

A handgun was found and no suspects are being sought, police spokeswoman Martha Guzman-Hurtado said.

'Everything that has been confirmed so
 far indicates it could be a murder-suicide but that has not been 
confirmed,' Guzman-Hurtado said.

'They are questioning other people before making that conclusion.'

Jonathan Garcia, 22, who lives across the street, said he was watching television at about 8:30 p.m. Monday when he heard yelling.

'I hear, "Get down, get down!" I recognize that as a cop's voice,' he said.

Garcia looked through the window and saw police in SWAT gear with submachine guns.

'So I come outside. They're all rushing at the house. There's a younger kid, probably 16 years old. He's screaming and yelling... he's saying, "That's my mom! That's my mom!"'

Garcia said a woman outside was crying and kept screaming in Spanish, 'They're all dead, they're all dead. He killed them all!'

Police handcuffed the frantic teen as he
 called for help, Garcia said, adding: 'They were still trying to figure
 out what happened.'

Garcia said the family had lived in the home about three years.

The bodies were spread throughout the house, Guzman-Hurtado said.

Guzman-Hurtado said records show the last time police visited the home was in June 2010 for an unspecified code-enforcement matter.

'It's a sad day in Fontana,' Guzman-Hurtado said. 'This is one of those days where we're all supposed to be celebrating with family, making new memories with family as we say goodbye to 2013 and welcome the New Year. It's not a day to be mourning lives lost.'

Fontana is a city of about 200,000 people in San Bernardino County about 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
