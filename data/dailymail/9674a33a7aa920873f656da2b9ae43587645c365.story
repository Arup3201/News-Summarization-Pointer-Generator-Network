A British tourist has been killed after being hit by a 4x4 while taking an evening stroll in the Canaries.

Darren Laurie, 29, from Scotland, died almost instantly after being hit by the car as he crossed an unlit road on the island of Fuerteventura.

Paramedics were called to the scene but could nothing to save him.

The 4x4 driver is understood to have called for assistance from his mobile phone after hitting Mr Laurie despite an attempt to swerve and avoid him.

The incident happened on Sunday night around 10pm in the town of Puerto Lajas, a former fishing village popular with windsurfers, just north of the island capital Puerto del Rosario.

Mr Laurie, who was holidaying on the island with his family, was crossing the main road running through the sunshine island when he was hit.

It is not known if his family were with him at the time.

Police confirmed last night the driver of the 4x4 involved in the incident, a locally-registered car, had been identified and was helping them with their inquiries.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Fuerteventura on May 12.

'We are providing consular assistance to his family at this difficult time.'
