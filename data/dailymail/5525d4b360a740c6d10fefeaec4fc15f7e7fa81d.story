'Special': Danny Wake, three, was killed in a suspected hit-and-run yesterday in Darlington

A three-year-old who was killed in a suspected hit and run was a 'very special' boy with a 'cheeky little smile', his family said today.

Danny Wake, from the Lascelles Park area in Darlington, County Durham, was out walking with his mother and two siblings in the town when he was hit by a vehicle.

Describing him as 'a loving and caring little boy', Danny’s family said they do not have the words to describe how much they will miss him.

They said: 'Danny was a beautiful, loving
and caring little boy, always laughing with a cheeky little smile.

'He 
had lots of friends and was adored by his little brother Georgie.

'We just can’t find words to describe how much our very special boy will be missed by all of the family.' 

Yesterday
police arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of causing death by 
dangerous driving and he remains in custody assisting them with their 
inquiries.

The incident took place at approximately 10.35am yesterday at the junction of 
Neasham Road and Falmer Road, which is in the centre of Darlington near 
the railway station. 

The boy was taken to 
Darlington Memorial Hospital by ambulance crews.

Superintendent Kevin Weir, 
leading the investigation for Durham Constabulary, said: 'This is a 
tragic incident and we have set up an incident room at Bishop Auckland 
police station to co-ordinate our enquiries and detectives from the 
force’s major crime team and road policing unit are assisting the 
investigation.'
