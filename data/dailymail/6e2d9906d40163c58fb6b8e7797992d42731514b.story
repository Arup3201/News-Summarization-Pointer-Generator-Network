CCTV has caught on camera the terrifying moment Burger King staff had to scramble for safety when a gunman burst into their fast food restaurant.

Police in Miami, Florida, are hoping surveillance video will lead them to the robbery suspect, who is shown wearing an orange hooded jacket.

The video shows employees as the gunman walks into a branch of the chain at Coral Way at about 9.30pm on Monday night.

The man is seen walking in, jumping the counter and heading right to the back of the restaurant.

One employee kneels down and appears to respond to something the robber said, NBC Miami reported.

Several camera angles show the gunman walking through the restaurant, with gun in hand, appearing to keep his head down, avoiding the cameras.

Police responded within minutes, and set up a perimeter thinking the suspect was still inside â€“ not knowing he slipped out a back door.

Police have not said how much money the robber took.

Customer Chris Herrera, who used to work at a fast food restaurant, said he understands why they are sometimes targeted.

'It is so cheap and just anybody walks through there,' he said.
