A 74-year-old man charged with killing two teenage tenants walked into their apartment and said he was going to shoot them before following through on his threat, authorities said today.

James Pak did not enter a plea during a 
brief court appearance on Monday afternoon in York County Superior Court
in Alfred, Maine.

Pak is charged with two counts of murder after the deaths of 19-year-old Derrick Thompson and his  girlfriend Alivia Welch, 18. Pak is being held without bail.

An affidavit says Pak also shot Thompson's mother twice but she survived by pretending to be dead.

Thompson and Welch, along with Thompson's mother and her six-year-old son, were living in an apartment attached to Pak's home.

Pak and his tenants were reportedly arguing about late rent and parking before the shooting.

Pak, a 74-year-old Korean War orphan and
local business owner, lived in one half of the duplex and rented out 
the other half. 

Neighbors described him as a 'horrible landlord,' with 
an short temper who spied on the people who rented from him. 

Officers believed they had quelled an argument between the tenants and Pak. Shots rang out three minutes after police left the property.

Pak also shot and wounded Mr 
Thompson's mother, Susan Johnson, 44, who was also living in the 
apartment with her six-year-old son, police say.

The
young boy was found hiding in a back bedroom. He and Ms Johnson, as 
well as Pak's wife, were rescued by officers shortly after the shooting,
the Portland Press Herald reports.

Pak barricaded himself in the house 
and refused to come out during an ensuing police standoff. He 
surrendered in his driveway after three hours, police said.

This is the third time this month that police in a small town in the Northeast have responded to horrifying gun violence.

On December 14, 20 first graders and six adults were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in upscale Newtown, Connecticut.

On Christmas Eve, a convicted felon shot dead two firefighters who were lured to their deaths when the gunman set fire to his home in the lakefront village of Webster, New York.

Biddeford is a quiet city of 21,000 about 20 miles southeast of Portland.

The Press Herald reports that police 
believe the shooting came as a result of a landlord-tenant dispute over 
parking at the house in the upscale neighborhood.

Thee
cars were parked in the driveway on Sunday morning. Ms Johnson called 
police to the duplex about 4pm after her son, Mr Thompson, and Pak began
fighting. Police say the argument may have escalated to shoving.

Officers said they calmed both the landlord and the tenants down and believed the argument was settled.

Police left the house about 7pm. Just three minutes later, they received received reports of a shooting at the home.

Officers returned to find Mr Thompson and his girlfriend Miss Welch shot to death and Ms Johnson wounded.

Johnson was being treated for a gunshot wound at a Portland hospital and is in stable condition, officials said. Her younger son, Brayden, was not hurt.

Detectives say Pak used a handgun in the shootings, but did not specify the make or model.

Ambitions: Alivia's Facebook page says she was studying nursing at the local community college

The young couple, along with Ms Johnson and her six-year-old son had been renting an apartment at the house since October.

Pak and his wife lived in the other side of the house. Neighbors called Pak a 'horrible landlord' who never kept tenants for more than a year. Previous tenants complained about Pak peeking in their windows.

Pak was known in his neighborhood as an exacting man with a violent temper, the Press Herald reports. He and his wife moved into the house five years ago and significantly renovated it.

Andrew Lemelin, 19, who lives across the street from Pak, said he experienced Pak's temper last year when he was hired to do work for the elderly man. Pak was not satisfied with Mr Lemelin's performance and sent a letter to the teen's father demanding he return the wages he paid.

Mr Lemelin told the Press Herald that when the family refused to give the money back, Pak began leaving angry, threatening messages on the family answering machine.

'He seemed like the kind of person who could deal without guns,' Mr Lemelin told the newspaper.
