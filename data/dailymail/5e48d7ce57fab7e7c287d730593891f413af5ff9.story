SNAPSHOTS: ENCOUNTERS WITH TWENTIETH CENTURY LEGENDS By Herbert Kretzmer (Robson Press £25)

The cast list of this collection is sumptuous — great film stars in their glory days, legends of the boxing ring, disc jockeys, racing jockeys, writers of plays and unforgettable songs, and a few unclassifiable men who became as rich as Walt Disney and Paul Getty.

What they had in common was being interviewed by the renowned journalist Herbert Kretzmer, who explains that his boyhood in a one-horse town in South Africa was lit up each week by a trip to the cinema, or ‘bioscope’ as it was called.

It gave him a hunger to get among the Hollywood stars, and so he did — treating them as equals. By then he was in showbusiness, too, as a lyric writer of albums and musicals. With many hits to his credit, he finally struck gold by writing the English lyrics to Les Miserables.

Some interviews are short, but his mere brush with Maurice Chevalier in his mean old age is enough to set the nerves jangling with dislike. So does the immature ignorance of a youthful Cliff Richard, who had toured South Africa without noticing that apartheid was a problem. ‘The coloured servants don’t really mind it. They get their food and board — why should they mind?’ he says.

As Kretzmer observes, ‘an image caught on the run can reveal more than a studio portrait’. It is not only what his subjects say but the way Kretzmer frames the snapshot that is revealing.

Many of the interviews were done in the Sixties. In that period, he and I saw each other most weekday nights during theatre intervals, as rival reviewers for Fleet Street newspapers.

We never discussed the show we were seeing — an unbreakable convention among critics, although actors believe that we conspire. So I have reason to respect Kretzmer’s shrewdness of eye and humorous sharpness of prose.

In those days, before tape recorders, we interviewed using the Old Technology — a notebook and pencil, an observant eye and a good memory. Nowadays, especially on TV, interviewers are noisy, interrupting, pestering people with questions — drawing attention to themselves.

A good interviewer gets past the persona that stars always have ready-prepared. He is looking for ore, and once he’s scented it, knows when to wait — giving his subjects confidence, to the point where they’ll confess what they usually keep hidden.

A stunningly brilliant example of this is Kretzmer’s session with the notoriously hard nut to crack, Cary Grant.

Invited to take a ride in Hyde Park in Grant’s Rolls-Bentley, Kretzmer notes how ‘indestructibly boyish’ the star looks in his 50s. But why did he walk out on so many wives?

At one point Grant says mysteriously: ‘We spend our time getting away from mother only to return to mother.’ Kretzmer notes this opening. But he waits. Grant is given to ‘High Himalayan Silences’. He says that even the most dedicated mother does not return love consistently. ‘There are periods of rejection, so the child grows up afraid of love.’

Kretzmer notes: ‘He seemed to be talking about himself.’

Grant goes on: ‘Eventually you’re afraid to give yourself fully to the beautiful blast of love. When love walks in, most people walk out.’

Kretzmer lights a cigarette and waits.

Grant continues: ‘I wouldn’t let myself feel love, and because of that I couldn’t give it. Every man’s first love is his mother. My own mother was brunette so I used to marry blondes.’

These reflections are interrupted by the park-keeper tapping on the window: ‘Lady asks if she can take yer snap.’

Go ahead, says Grant — the lady was blonde.

The ageless boy of 56 and the boy from the South African bush sit on companionably. Grant says he thinks he’s broken the patterns of blondes and failure. He drops Kretzmer off at his home. ‘I’m going to Bristol to see my mother. She’s 83’.

In parting he adds: ‘I’m really getting to enjoy my mother’s company’, and glides away in his car.

There are plenty more nuggets, often in a brief flash. J. Paul Getty talks ‘in a slow solemn undertone, like a family doctor preparing to give bad news to the relatives’.

On the frequency of his divorces, he told Kretzmer: ‘A rich man’s wife begins to feel useless. Servants do all the work. And I couldn’t spare women a lot of time.’ Rex Harrison, too, found women dispensable. ‘They now want total independence, yet they still want to be taken care of, don’t they? They insist on careers but I don’t find career women particularly happy, do you? They’re taking on pressures they are not built to withstand. Soon they’ll be dying sooner than we do!’

At this Mr Harrison ‘chortled into his iced drink’.

Marlene Dietrich would probably have agreed. ‘Men are stronger characters than women, not so muddled in their thinking. I have a brain more male than female,’ she told Kretzmer.

Ever-genial David Niven, when asked if there was anything he disliked about himself, studied his nails and said: ‘I know exactly what I dislike. I am too busy trying to get everybody to like me. So I am thought shallow and artificial.’

He studied his nails some more. ‘Artificial . . . and shallow,’ he repeated softly, leaving us to wonder — was he?

Ever-genial David Niven, when asked if there was anything he disliked about himself, studied his nails and said: ‘I know exactly what I dislike. I am too busy trying to get everybody to like me. So I am thought shallow and artificial.’

Perhaps the saddest piece is on Peter Sellers, the master impersonator.

Kretzmer, who knew him, ‘or rather didn’t know him’, for 20 years, says: ‘He saw himself as an unfinished man who had been denied a definable personality. People wanted more from him than he could give, and nothing — and nobody — satisfied him for long.’

Throughout, Kretzmer remains a courteous, self-effacing observer of the games others play. I won’t say his book is unputdownable. Its attraction is that it is putdownable. It should be savoured a brandy glassful at a time — ideal for sipping at the bedside.
