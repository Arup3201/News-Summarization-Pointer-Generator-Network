Real Madrid supporters booed coach Carlo Ancelotti and goalkeeper Iker Casillas but saw their team win 2-0 against Deportivo to stay clear at the top of La Liga.

There were even a few jeers for an out-of-sorts for Cristiano Ronaldo when he blasted a second half free-kick over but the Ballon D’Or set up the second for Karim Benzema after Isco had scored the first.

The worst whistles were reserved for Ancelotti and Casillas and were audible when the team and managers’ names were announced before kick-off. Casillas’ error had cost Real Madrid the opening goal seven days earlier in the 4-0 derby day defeat to Atletico Madrid and Ancelotti was criticised for his team selection but as with most of the abuse levelled at Real players from their own fans – most recently to Gareth Bale – it was incomprehensible especially as it came at the start of the game and seemed to help ensure Madrid made a nervous start.

Casillas at least wasted no time in responding to the boo-boys with a fine save at his near-post from Isaac Cuenca. The former Barcelona winger tested the home defence on several occasions in the first 15 minutes.

For Madrid, Ronaldo hit the bar and Bale then charged through to the edge of the area and did likewise with a ferocious shot. The Welshman turned provider next with a cross that Benzema should have done better with but allowed Fabricio to push away for a corner.

When Real finally took the lead on 23 minutes it was from Isco just inside the area immediately after Ronaldo had missed from much closer in. He failed to finish from a yard out from Benzema’s cross and Isco saved the day with a curling shot into the far corner when it looked as if Deportivo had cleared the danger.

It was a boost for the team but Ronaldo's miss did nothing to improve his state of mind. He had made an uncharacteristically quiet start to the game after a tumultuous week when the celebration of his 30th birthday party had made almost as much news as Madrid’s derby-day defeat that came just hours before it.

Bale was comfortably Real Madrid’s best performer in the first half and his run and cross gave Ronaldo the chance to make it two but he headed over. There was one moment of brilliant skill from Ronaldo who turned Deportivo’s 39-year-old full-back Manuel Pablo inside out but it was Bale who finished the half strongly crossing from the right only for team-mates to again fail to capitalise.

If Real had started to look more convincing at the end of the first half that was all forgotten at the start of the second with Deportivo hitting the post from Celso Borges and Casillas making a fine save down to his left from Wigan loanee Oriol Riera. The jeers for the keeper at the start of the game were now replaced with applause. He was keeping Real Madrid in the game.

Goalscorer Isco had to intervene at the back post to break down another visitors’ attack. And Ronaldo’s afternoon was getting no better as he blasted a free-kick over the bar from the edge of the area and there were even a few jeers for the three-times Ballon d’Or winner.

Real Madrid brought on winter window signing Lucas Silva for Asier Illaramendi with 20 minutes left and immediately got the second goal. Ronaldo played Benzema in and he scored with a first-time shot over the advancing Fabricio. Jese Rodriguez came on for Benzema and set-up Ronaldo now playing at centre-forward. The Portuguese sent the chance wide smashing the turf in frustration at the miss.

Madrid stay top with the win and remain Champions League favourites ahead of this week’s trip to Germany to play Schalke but the mood has changed considerably since the group stages when they and their talisman Ronaldo looked invincible.
