A photographer has captured the astonishing details on small creatures' faces - by spending hours hovering over them and taking extreme close-up photographs.

Colin Hutton, 29, has created stunning portraits of the world's most overlooked animals including spiders, wasps, bees, common flies, and beetles.

He only pictures the animals alive and can spend up to three hours painstakingly trying to keep the insects still while he zooms in on his camera.

Photographer Colin Hutton, 29, has created stunning portraits of the world's most overlooked animals, pictured, including spiders, wasps, bees, common flies, and beetles. The images are made using a powerful macro lens and can be incredibly hard to achieve because of the quick movements of the creatures. He also photographed weevils, pictured. Many weevils are damaging to crops

Colin, from North Carolina in the U.S, scours local parks to find the insects but will travel over 600 miles to his parent's house in Florida to capture more unusual bugs.

His favourite subjects are jumping spiders and he is even considering a trip to Australia to find the Peacock spider, due to their colourful abdomens.

One such jumping spider capture by Hutton is the Phidippus mystaceus spider.

It is found in North America and females grow the largest, reaching around one centimetre in body length. Females also have the most pronounced 'moustache', found below the eyes, and in fact the name of the species means Jumping Moustache.

The red back salamander, pictured, is a small terrestrial salamander usually found in forested areas under rocks and logs across eastern North America, west to Missouri, south to North Carolina, and north from southern Quebec and the Maritime Provinces in Canada to Minnesota. They are also known as the eastern red backed salamander or the northern red back salamander depending on where they are found. Adults grow between 5.7 and 10 cm in length

Colin, who has just finished a degree in environmental science, said: 'I originally planned to focus on reptiles and amphibians but I soon realised how many insects are out there.

'I try to capture the insects out in the field but sometimes I bring them home so I can photograph them there with lighting.

'Taking the photograph itself doesn't take too long but it can be difficult when they are moving around as it becomes very sensitive when you are zoomed in so much.

'Sometimes I can spend a couple of hours trying to get the perfect shot and it can be quite difficult.

'The
small varieties of the jumping spider are very active so often I look 
through the lens and I have to find it as it moves around.

'After working with them for so long I now know what to expect and how to handle them.

'I
try to photography any insect I can and I often travel to Florida to 
see my parents but take my camera and focus on the insects they have 
over there.

'I went on a 
trip to Colombia and took my camera and one day I would love to travel 
to Australia and take a photograph of the Peacock jumping spider they 
have there.'

The name of 
the Chalcid wasp, photographed by Hutton in northern America, comes from
the Greek for 'copper' because of their metallic colour.

The name of the Chalcid wasp, pictured, comes from the Greek for 'copper' because of their metallic colour. There are said to be around 22,000 known species of chalcids and each eat the eggs or larvae of other insects as food. As a result, the wasps keep crop pests under control and many species have been imported into regions for this reason

There are said to be around 22,000 
known species of Chalcids and each eat the egg or larvae of other 
insects for food. As a result, the wasps keep crop pests under control, 
and many species have been imported into regions with the sole purpose 
of controlling pests.

Hutton also managed to capture a 
series of dragonflies including a pair of small to medium-sized skimmers
known as Erythrodiplax minuscula, or dragonlets.

They are found in the eastern United 
States, Argentina and Columbia. The insects reach a length of up to 
2.7cm and their wings are almost as long, at 2.1cm. Young dragonlets are
a green-brown colour while the adults are predominantly ash blue.

Hutton photographed a number of flies
and damselflies on his travels, too, including the robber fly and the Rambur's forktail damselfly. The male Rambur's forktails 
are green with blue abdomens, while the females can range from being 
orange-red, olive green or similar to males in colour. It was named in 
honour of entomologist Jules Pierre Rambur.

The
robber fly has spiny legs and stiff bristles on its face called the 
mystax, from the Greek mystakos meaning 'moustache' or 'upper lip'. 
Adults grow to around 1.5 cm in length.

Hutton also captured images of reptiles, including the red back salamander.
