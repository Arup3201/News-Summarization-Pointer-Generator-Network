The U.S. government is selling off scores of aging but spectacular lighthouses.

Often perched on rocky cliffs or out to sea on remote islands, the structures are being flogged for pennies in the dollar to history buffs or nautical enthusiasts - though the sale comes with a catch.

The National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000 means the brave souls who purchase the awe-inspiring, antiquated lighthouses have to refurbish them, no matter how remote their location.

Spectacular: Boston Harbor landmark Graves Island Light Station, pictured, is among the lighthouses up for sale

Aging: The Graves Island Light Station, pictured was built in 1903

Cheap: Bidding is slated to open on June 10, with a $25,000 starting bid

One of the stunning structures up for sale this summer is the Graves Island Light Station located in Boston Harbor.

According to Curbed.com, the auctioning off of the 1903 landmark is slated for June 10, with a starting bid of just $25,000. For that you get a 10-acre ledge, at low tide, the 113-foot stone tower, and a precariously placed oil house.

Another property on the market is the Orient Point Lighthouse near the tip of Long Island's North Fork and nearby Plum Island.

Up for sale: The Maine structure, pictured, is open for inspection on June 10 with the current bid at $154,000

Maintenance: The National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act of 2000 requires buyers to demonstrate that they are maintaining the properties

For just $10,000 this historic landmark could be yours, though the highest bidder will have to spend a small fortune bringing the building back up to safety standards, as its base is often submerged in water.

Possibly the biggest bargain of the lot is the Saybrook Breakwater Lighthouse in Connecticut, which is up for sale for just $1.

The 1886 structure towers 48-feet into the air and is located at the end of an Army Corps of Engineers breakwater, though it's only accessible by water.

Long Island: Another lighthouse on the market is the Orient Point Lighthouse, pictured, near the tip of Long Island's North Fork and nearby Plum Island

Landmark: For just $10,000 this historic landmark could be yours

Refurbishment: The highest bidder will have to spend a small fortune bringing the Long Island structure back up to safety standards

One of the marine wonders on the market is not a lighthouse at all but a fog horn station.

Manana Island Sound Signal Station near the Maine island of Monhegan is open for inspection on June 10 with the current bid at $154,000.

The building has been slowly rotting away for years, and the government hopes it can find someone to give it the love it deserves.

Bargain: Possibly the biggest bargain of the lot is the Saybrook Breakwater Lighthouse, pictured, which is up for sale for just $1

Falling apart: The Butler Flats Lighthouse, pictured, sits just off the coast of New Bedford, Massachusetts

Remote: The winning bidder is required by law to maintain the properties
