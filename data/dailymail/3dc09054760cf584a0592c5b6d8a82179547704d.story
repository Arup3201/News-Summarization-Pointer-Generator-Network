Appeal: Alan Jeal was only identified after his relatives recognised this artist's impression that was posted on the Devon and Cornwall police website

A dead man who was washed up naked on a Cornish beach has been identified as a 64-year-old who lived alone and had not been reported missing.

Alan Eric Jeal, 64, was found by a dog walker at high tide at 2pm last Tuesday on Perranporth beach in Cornwall. He was wearing nothing but socks and one walking shoe.

His identity remained a mystery for seven days, until his relatives this Tuesday recognised an artist's impression of his face on Devon and Cornwall Police's website.

Police are treating Mr Jeal's death as suspicious after a post-mortem revealed that he had suffered a number of injuries.

Detective Chief Inspector Dave Thorne, senior investigating officer in the case, said Mr Jeal was formally identified yesterday and his next of kin informed of his death.

'Firstly, our thoughts are with Alan's family and friends at this upsetting time and we will do everything we can to support them,' said the policeman.

'Now that we know his identity, we can progress with the investigation and try to find out exactly what happened to him.

'He was last seen on Monday 24 February, the day before his body was discovered, and I would welcome information from anyone who knew Alan, or who saw him in the days leading up to his death.'

A CCTV image has been released showing the last known sighting of Mr Jeal, on Monday February 24, just after 12pm, in Wadebridge town centre.

Poignant: This photograph was also found on the same beach. It is believed to show Mr Jeal as a child

Police have also released a series of photographs of objects found near Mr Jeal's body on the beach.

A Regatta jacket, a wallet and a photograph of a young boy were discovered a day after Mr Jeal's body was found and are believed to have belonged to him.

The photograph, dated 13 April 1952, is thought to show Mr Jeal in the family home when he was two years old.

It is not known whether a rucksack and woolly hat are linked to him.

Mr Jeal, who lived alone in Wadebridge, was not reported as missing to police before the discovery of his body.
