American sprinter Wallace Spearmon has accepted a three-month suspension after testing positive for methylprednisolone, the United States Anti-Doping Agency has announced.

The 29-year-old 200 metres specialist returned a positive test in an in-competition urine sample collected at the Edmonton International Track Classic in July.

Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticosteroid prohibited in competition and classified as a specified substance, meaning its presence can come with a reduced sanction.

USADA said in a statement: 'USADA announced today that Wallace Spearmon, Jr, of Fayetteville, Ark, an athlete in the sport of track & field, has tested positive for a prohibited substance and accepted a three-month sanction for his rule violation.'

The anti-doping body added in the statement that it accepted Spearmon's explanation that the substance was not being used to enhance performance, but 'he was taking the prescribed medication in a therapeutic dose under the care of a physician'.

Spearmon, though, failed to apply for a therapeutic use exemption before using the medication.

His three-month ban was backdated to start on August 27.

Spearmon is a former world 4x100m relay champion and world 200m silver medallist. He is the seventh fastest man over 200m in history with a best of 19.65 seconds.

Norway's Jaysuma Saidy Ndure, Wallace Spearmon and France's Christophe Lemaitre compete in the men's 200m semi-finals at London 2012
