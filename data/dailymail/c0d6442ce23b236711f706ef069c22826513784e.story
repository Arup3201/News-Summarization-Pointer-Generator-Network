People in their early fifties are the most unhappy in Britain, a study has found.

Official figures show a ‘u-shape’ of happiness throughout the average lifetime, with youngsters and the retired at the top, while those in their late forties and early fifties languish at the bottom.

The Office for National Statistics said people felt most miserable at the age when they often had most responsibilities, but still saw retirement as out of reach.

As well as still working, many middle-aged people are stretched between the dual responsibilities of looking after children – who typically leave home much later – and elderly parents who are living longer but require more care.

‘There is a very strong age profile which shows that well-being dips when people are middle-aged,’ said Glenn Everett, director of the ONS Measuring National Well-being Programme.

‘Perhaps it is when you have got kids and a mortgage compared to when you are young and have fewer responsibilities. When people are nearing retirement, your well-being picks up again, which may be due to reduced responsibilities or greater contentment.’

The evidence of middle-aged misery was uncovered in a Government-funded well-being survey, which attempts to measure the nation’s life satistfaction.

According to the findings, happiness generally falls after the age of 19, a time when university and establishing a career beckons.

It doesn’t rise again until  people reach their late fifties. Then it continues to increase until age 75, after which it dips slightly. But it’s not all bad news. The survey of 165,000 people found Britons are more satisfied with their lives than at any time  since 2011.

Anxiety levels have also fallen, while happiness and feelings that life is worthwhile have increased.

The ONS said people appeared to be feeling more positive about the economy as a result of falling unemployment rates. Dawn Snape, one of the co-authors of the report, said: ‘The unemployment rate has a profound impact on happiness. Not only does it affect the people who are unemployed, but also those people around them.’

Although wages are currently rising at just half the rate of inflation, she said many could see ‘the light at the end of the tunnel’.

‘They are starting to feel their finances are getting better even when, objectively, we know that is not the case,’ she said.

Prime Minister David Cameron ordered the annual research, first published in 2012, after deciding the Government should be informed about quality of life.

Previously criticised for producing predictable results, the £1.5million-a-year inquiry into Britain’s national well-being measures everything from job satisfaction to levels of depression.

The personal well-being section – which asks four questions about happiness, life satisfaction, anxiety and whether life is worthwhile – costs £200,000 alone.

The latest study found happiness levels varied across different parts of the UK.

The five happiest places were Antrim, Fermanagh, Omagh and Dungannon in Northern Ireland, and Babergh in Suffolk.

The most miserable areas were Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, Dartford in Kent, Torridge in Devon, Maldon in Essex, and South Ribble in Lancashire.

GROWN-UP children who can’t afford to fly the nest may well be adding to the stress of their middle-aged parents.

But there is still a great deal of joy to be found in raising a family – with stay-at-home mothers among the happiest people in the UK.

Research by the Office for National Statistics found those who looked after family instead of working – a group dominated by women – were more likely to describe their lives as ‘worthwhile’ than the employed.

Stay-at-home parents and carers gave an average score of 8.03 out of ten when asked if they felt what they did was worthwhile, compared to 7.85 for workers, 7.92 for retired people and 7.73 for students.

They were also happier than employed people, scoring 7.46 compared with 7.43.

Marie Peacock, chairman of campaign group Mothers at Home Matter, told the Mail: ‘We are not surprised by the research which shows that people are enjoying being at home with their family.

‘There is an enormous amount of pleasure to be gained from raising a family, and it would be wonderful if politicians would recognise in their policies that there is a yearning for people to spend time with their children.’

The survey also found married people to be happier than cohabiting couples.

Those who were married or in civil partnerships scored 7.66 out of ten, while partners living together rated themselves as 7.37. Single people lagged behind with a score of 7.14, while divorcees were least cheerful at 6.9.

The findings echo an Open University study earlier this year, which concluded that although married people have greater doubts than unmarried couples about the quality of their relationship, they are more content.
