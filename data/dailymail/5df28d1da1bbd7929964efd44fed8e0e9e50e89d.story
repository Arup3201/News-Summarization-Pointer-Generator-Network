Most parents would give anything for their teenage son to pick up an iron.

But for one teen, pressing his shirts has turned into an extreme hobby.

Kevin Krupitzer, 17, has turned the mundane into the insane by taking his ironing board to the most extraordinary of locations, from the edge of cliff to on board a canoe.

A pressing need for adventure: The 17-year-old was inspired to perform his bizarre stunts after he was given a calender called 'extreme ironing'

Creasing up: The daredevil says his pictures have made his friends laugh and he has enjoyed ironing - so long as he doesn't have to do it in his home

The teenager travels around his hometown of Gilbert, Arizona in search of the weirdest places to 'iron'.

And he has even climbed to the top of a 120ft high rock, dubbed the Totem Pole in Queen Creek Canyon in pursuit of his bizarre hobby.

But with most of his locations lacking a place to plug his iron, Kevin poses with the iron and board to add to his collection of extreme ironing images.

He said: 'I've always liked the outdoors and have always enjoyed hiking and backpacking.

'The extreme ironing came about when my brother brought me an Extreme Ironing calendar as a joke present.

'I immediately thought that looks cool, I might give it a go.

'Sometimes if I'm hiking I'll bring the board with me and look out for an unusual place to iron.

'I like the idea of doing something really mundane in the least mundane of places.

'The
most extreme place I've ironed is probably in the middle of a canal and
our most recent trip to the Totem Pole was pretty extreme.

'It's just become a bit of a hobby really something I do with my brother and friends. It makes for some funny pictures.

But, sadly for his parents, the teen's interest in pressing his shirts ends when he steps through the door to his home.

The teenager, from Arizona, has managed to bridge the gap between a dull household chore and a thrilling adventure

For most ironing is one of those boring chores we tend to put off doing - but Kevin has found a way to make it entertaining

'The funny thing is I'll take the ironing board out with me when I'm going hiking but I rarely use it to actually iron at home,' he said.

But Kevin might have competition when it comes to the most extreme activity with an ironing board.

A super-fit British man braved the desert heat to complete a 155-mile run with an ironing board strapped to his back.

Paul Roberts, 45, took on the Marathon des Sables which involved completing the equivalent of a marathon every day for six days in a row.

The father of two finished in an impressive 364th place - beating more than half of the 860 strong field.

The annual race, described as one of the world's toughest, is held in the Moroccan Sahara where temperatures can reach 50c.
