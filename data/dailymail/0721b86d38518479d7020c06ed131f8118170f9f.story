Forget football and the beauty salon - according to a new study, women seek well-travelled, cultured and informed guys, while men seek ambitious, active and creative girls.

In a recent eHarmony survey of more than 100,000 members, it was revealed that some hobbies can have a significant impact on boosting a single’s chances of scoring a date, while other pastimes may actually be doing more harm than good.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Lloyd and Kellie Davis-Slade, who met on eHarmony in 2012, say they were instantly attracted to each other's profiles, although they admitted many users secretly make up hobbies in the hope of attracting the opposite sex.

47-year-old Lloyd Davis-Slade (pictured right) and 38-year-old Kellie Davis-Slade (pictured left) met on dating site eHarmony 

The couple, who are now the proud parents to one and a half year old daughter Elena Rose, hit it off on the first date. 

47-year-old Lloyd, who hails from New York, had been married before and was looking for the love of his life. He knew straight away that 38-year-old Kellie was different to the other five women he had been on dates with from the site. 

'I liked the idea of eHarmony because you could put in all the information about yourself and who you are and what you’re looking for in life and what your interests are,' Lloyd told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I did it for about a year and I was at the end of it and starting to get discouraged a little bit because I was just going through this series of meet ups and dates and they just weren't going anywhere.

All of a sudden, Kellie, who was born in the Chester in the UK, came into his life. She liked the same movies as Lloyd, had the same musical taste and most importantly had the same life goals.

Kellie, who is an IT professional was interested in Kung Fu, while Lloyd, who works in Harley Davidson, was obsessed with motorcycles. 

'Our hobbies were different but the thing that really attracted us to each other was our life goals and our plans and what we wanted out of life,' a besotted Lloyd said.

'We both wanted to meet somebody that we could fall in love with. We both wanted to get married. We both wanted to start a family. We both wanted similar life plans.  

'I saw her (Kellie), she was lovely and beautiful and she was a good listener and it seemed like she was keen and was looking for the same things as I was.'

Just eight months after meeting the pair got married in September 2012 and ten months after that they welcomed their baby girl Elena into the world.

According to the findings, men with an interest in politics are considered the most attractive to women, followed by those with an interest in travel, health and exercise, food and theatre.

On the flipside, the top five hobbies and interests listed by women that are most likely to capture men’s attention are personal growth, health and exercise, food, family and dancing. 

However, Kellie disputes these findings and said politics would not be on the top of her list when looking for the perfect partner.

'Politics has no effect on how I felt about anyone,' she said. 

'For me it was having a varied interest. I looked at the outdoors so somebody who liked that as well. You just want to see that somebody has interest in a few different areas.'

While Kellie said exercise was important, she believes some of the men on the site put too much emphasis on their physique.

'I noticed when I was on eHarmony most of the guys would upload a photo of when they are overseas, a photo where they're exercising,' she said. 

'Men will try and make themselves seem more active than they were so they would make out like they cycled all the time or  lifted weights everyday, when that’s not really the truth.

'People do try and demonstrate that they have varied interests on the site.

Although dating wasn't always plain sailing on the site for Kellie and Lloyd. 

While one woman had posted on her profile saying she didn't have any kids, she suddenly revealed to Lloyd on one of their dates that she actually had an 18-year-old son. 

Kellie found out the hard way that one man wasn't exactly Mr Right after he failed to let her know he was still living with his ex-girlfriend. 

Lloyd was different - he made Kellie laugh and had the same life goals as her.

'We just clicked straight away,' she said. 

Lloyd said he was very honest with Kellie very early on, that way there was no confusion or secrets to be found out later. 

The pair were married within eight months of meeting and now have a one and a half year old daughter called Elena 

'I was always up front. It actually scared some women away because I came on too full on. It scared away the fails and my attitude was: why else are you on this thing unless you’re planning on settling down?,' he said. 

'I think there’s a lot of fear and doubt out there and they’re scared and people so much want to impress somebody and fall in love with somebody, they’re willing to fudge the truth in the beginning.

'Really the best way to get in the door is just to be upfront and truthful in the beginning and that way the right doors open not the wrong doors.'

Both Kellie and Lloyd believe many people's profiles can be a major turn-off, with Lloyd claiming women who paraded their wine glasses on their cover photo turned him away. 

'There’s a high number of women who put their profile photo up of them drinking. I don’t want to judge but I’m sober, so when I saw that it was a turn-off, it kind of gives the wrong impression,' he said.

Kellie believes men who come across like they only have one interest are a major turn-off and show that they do not have time in their lives for anything else.  

'A lot of men on the profile said they were into football,' she said. 

'Really sports mad is really off-putting, especially for me because I don’t like going to sports games. 

'A lot of men would really push it. One of the questions was: what are your five favourite things? and some of them would put football for all five. I'm sure they thought it was funny but it was just an immediate no.'

Though the findings suggest that personal hobbies and interests can have an impact on how we’re perceived by the opposite sex, eHarmony matches its members based on core personality traits and values, which, in the long run, are far more significant than superficial factors like hobbies which evolve over time.
