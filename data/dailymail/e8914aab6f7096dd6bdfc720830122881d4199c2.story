A bidding war between sportswear giants Nike and adidas is set to push the value of Manchester United’s next kit deal beyond the £70m-a-year mark, it emerged on Tuesday evening.

Just a day after Arsenal signed a British record deal with Puma of £35m-a-year, Sportsmail can reveal that the battle for United’s next kit reached fever pitch this week with rival companies adidas, Warrior and Puma all attending meetings with commercial director Richard Arnold to pitch for the deal.

United’s current suppliers Nike are favourites to renew the present contract that runs at £23.5m-a-year and expires in 2015.

However a period of exclusivity – 
during which United could talk only to them about a new contract – ran 
out at the end of last July and United are now free to speak to rival 
bidders.

Adidas were first 
through the door at Old Trafford this week, spending Monday outlining 
their plans to Arnold and his team. Officials from up and coming US firm
 Warrior – who pay £25m-a-year to supply Liverpool’s kit – spent all day
 at the club on Tuesday while Puma are expected to attend meetings on Wednesday.

It
 is understood that United and Nike have had some serious disagreements 
over the way a new contract would be structured in the last two weeks 
and it is this that has opened the door for adidas and others.

The
 winner from the whole thing will be United, of course, as serious 
competition from other brands will only serve to drive up the price over
 and above the £65m-a-year mark experts originally thought it would come
 in at.

One industry expert said: 'This
 is great news for United as the more serious interest they attract from
 rival competitors, the higher the numbers they will manage to 
eventually get on the contract.'

The
 new deal is expected to run over five years and come in at over £350m 
in total. It serves to indicate just how powerful the Barclays Premier 
League champions are, regardless of their recent difficulties on the 
field under new manager David Moyes.

The
 deal will dwarf not only Arsenal’s recent Puma contract but also 
Chelsea’s £20m-a-year contract with adidas and Manchester City’s 
£12m-a-year arrangement with Nike.

Another
 number to look out for in the coming weeks is that attached to 
Barcelona’s forthcoming new deal with Nike. It is understood that Nike 
are contractually bound to match that at least when dealing with United.

A club spokesman said: 'We currently are in discussions with multiple parties regarding our Global Retail, Apparel & Product Licensing business starting in the 2015/16 Season.

'This process is a routine practice used for our global and regional sponsorship deals and helps us maximize the value/structure of the Club’s partnerships.'
