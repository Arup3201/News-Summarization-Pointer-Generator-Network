Joe Hart signed a new  contract at Manchester City on Friday but his joy turned to bewilderment upon leaving their training ground when he found his Bentley covered in wrapping paper.

A CityTV presenter, dressed as a Mancunian Father Christmas, used 37 roles of wrapping paper in an attempt to cover the car but only managed to wrap the back end.

When asked what he thought of the attempt, Hart said: 'People always ask me what I want for Christmas and now I know what to say - "I want my car ruined by cheap Sellotape and Nike towels."'

Even the prankster admitted: 'I'm disappointed with the wrapping but what can you do in these (windy) conditions.' 

Hart signed a long-term contract worth £120,000-a-week on Friday, tying him to Manchester City until 2019.

‘Wanting to stay here was never going to be an issue for me. I’ve loved every moment since I joined,’ said Hart.

‘The club’s doing amazing things. We’ve created history and we want to keep doing that. The club’s growing and I’ve been really lucky to be part of the ride. We’re enjoying building that winning mentality, how the club is growing around us and how we need to grow along with it.’
