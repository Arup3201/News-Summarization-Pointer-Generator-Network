There could be new rules on the use of commercial drones which zip through the sky in the U.S.  making them a part of everyday life, according to plans proposed by the Federal Aviation Administration.

At some point in the near future drones could perform routine tasks such as aerial photography, mapping, crop monitoring and inspections of cell towers, bridges and other tall structures.

But they may not be able to do other tasks like deliver pizzas, as safety restrictions will mean drones must be kept within sight of operators at all times and there'll be no night time flights.

FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said: 'We have tried to be flexible in writing these rules.

'We want to maintain today's outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry.' 

He said the agency intends to issue final rules as quickly as it can.

Among the proposals being laid out are requirements that commercial operators will need to meet in order to be allowed to fly small drones weighing less than 55 pounds.

It means that operators will have to pass a knowledge test administered by the FAA and a security check by the Transportation Safety Administration.

The measures being unveiled by the FAA  are still in the works and it could be two or three years before the rules are made final.

Brian Wynne, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group said: 'The proposed rules are 'a good first step' bringing the U.S. closer to realizing the benefits of drone technology' 

No fly zone: Legally, drones can’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile (8km) radius of medium and large airports.

However as drones are introduced, some will worry about their ability to impact their privacy, particularly over homes and offices. 

To allay these fears, Ben Marcus, a pilot from California teamed up with drone makers to create a global database called NoFlyZone.org that lets anyone set up no-fly zones above their homes.

It works by users using a website to enter their location, name and an email address to verify the request.

This address is converted into a latitude and longitude point, as well as a series of points that accurately marks out the edges of a property. 

Legally, drones can’t be flown over restricted airspace including national parks, military bases and within a five mile (8km) radius of medium and large airports.

Yet federal officials said that once commercial drones are in place the economic and safety benefits of unmanned aircraft are expected to be enormous. 

Even with the restrictions, drones are expected to play a 'transformative role in fields as diverse as urban infrastructure management, farming, public safety, coastal security, military training, search and rescue, and disaster response,' the White House said.

However, there will be measures that federal agencies must follow to guard against abuse of data collected in drone flights. 

Among other steps, the order requires agencies to review privacy and civil rights protections before deploying drone technology and to adhere to a range of controls. 

Personally identifiable information collected in drone flights is to be kept no longer than 180 days, although there are exceptions.

It's questionable whether such steps will satisfy civil liberties advocates, who've objected strongly to the government's vigorous use of digital surveillance in the name of national security.

The proposal also raises the possibility that final rules may include a separate category for very small drones — those weighing 4.4 pounds or less — that would include fewer restrictions.
