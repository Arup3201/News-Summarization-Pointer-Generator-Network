Charges: Former New York Giants offensive lineman Lucas 'Luke' Petitgout was arrested Tuesday on a charge of sexual assault in Bergen County, according to county records

Former New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Luke Petitgout has been charged with assault and sexual assault in New Jersey after alleged attack.

Petitgout's attorney, Patrick J. Jennings, said Tuesday the allegations are baseless and he intends to vigorously defend the former offensive lineman.

Petitgout was arrested in Woodcliff around 6 a.m. yesterday morning and was being held on $50,000 bail in the Bergen County jail.

The charges were filed in Pascack Joint Municipal Court on Tuesday. 

The 38-year-old had just come from a Giants reunion when the attack allegedly took place.

It is believed that were witnesses who saw what happened and they may now be called to testify should the charges stand.

Petitgout was later charged with sexual assault with force and simple assault. 

He was also ordered to be held on $50,000 bail, Bergen County jailhouse records show. 

Petitgout had a misdemeanor harassment case against him dropped in New York last year after his wife accused him of hitting her.

On that occasion he was accused of roughing up his wife Jennifer after a night out in the Meatpacking District but the case was thrown out because the charges could not be proven.

He allegedly hit her in the head and threw her out of the car on their wedding anniversary after the couple had been celebrating.

Petitgout played college football for the University of Notre Dame. As a pro, the tackle played for the Giants for eight years, and spent the last season of his career playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Petitgout retired in 2007

She was treated at New York Downtown Hospital for bruises following the attack.

Cops say she told them she 'feared for her life.'

Petigout was charged with misdemeanor assault but Jennifer dropped the charges against her 6-foot-6, 310 pound husband.

In June he was again arrested for allegedly punching a clubgoer inside Rockefeller Center. 

Petitgout played college football at Notre Dame and spent eight seasons with the Giants and one with the Buccaneers.
