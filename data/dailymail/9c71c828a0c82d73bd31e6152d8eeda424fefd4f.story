College footballer mom April Justin is not known for hiding her feelings.Â 

Justin became an Internet star two years ago when video of her obvious disappointment that son Landon Collins refused to play for Louisiana State University went viral.

The self-professed LSU fan made headlines again yesterday when her younger son Gerald Willis III also announced he didn't want to join his mother's favorite team.

Justin could barely crack a smile after Willis picked the Florida Gators over LSU during the 2014 Under Armour All-America Game.

'It is what it is...LSU is still number one,' Justin said, frowning. 'I feel LSU is a better place for him to be. LSU Tigers number one'

Willis said it was his big brother, Collins, who helped him make up his mind.

'He just told me that I need to get out of Louisiana and see a different life. He told me the Gators defense fit me and I would be dominant at Florida,' he said.

Although Justin wasn't impressed, sports commentators say her reaction this time around was more subdued than in 2012 when she held her head in her hands as Collins chose Alabama over LSU to progress his college football career.

'I feel LSU is a better place for him to be. LSU Tigers number one,' she told reporters after Collins' announcement.

Yahoo! Sports reported Justin's comments fueled ridicule from LSU fans and Collins' fellow All America Game teammates.

'There is a way to conduct yourself in those situations,' Ramsey (N.J.) Don Bosco defensive lineman Darius Hamilton told Rivals.com.

'When you are on national television she shouldn't have done that to her son. There is still a long way to go until National Signing Day and whatever issues she has should have been worked out behind the scenes.'

Not thrilled: Justin was extremely disappointed at her son's choice but couldn't do anything about it

Justin is known in college football circles for her hands-on management approach.

She teamed up with other experienced 'recruiting moms' last year to run a 'Momma Knows Best' seminar in New Orleans. The women shared their first-hand knowledge of the college athletics recruiting process with other parents.

'I've just been a football mom. Until the day that (Landon Collins) made his commitment (on ESPN), I didn't know that it was that big,' Justin told SportsNOLA in September.

'It was crazy! Some coaches plant Hollywood dreams in a recruit's head. Some don't 
figure on a redshirt year as freshmen. Landon didn't. He was 
disappointed in his contribution. I told him to stay focused.

'We are parents. We have to 
continue to be parents all the way through college. This process will 
impact my child's life. Education is the key to success. Sports is not 
guaranteed for anyone. An education is the road to success.

'Recruiters look at us as just moms.
 They don't think we have the knowledge. We get pushed to the side.'
