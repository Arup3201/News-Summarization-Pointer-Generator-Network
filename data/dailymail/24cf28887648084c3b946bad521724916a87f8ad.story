Paul Robinson may have left Tottenham more than six years ago – but he proved he is still a favourite among the White Hart Lane fans.

Robinson spent four years in north London before leaving for Blackburn and made an appearance back at the Lane for Ledley King’s testimonial.

And the former England No 1 made sure he got the fans onside as he lead them in a chorus of ‘Stand up if you hate Arsenal.’

It is not the first time Robinson has done this, during his Tottenham days he did the same thing back in 2008 in a Europa League tie away at Slavia Prague.

Robinson was playing for a Ledley King Guest XI made up of current and ex-players who played alongside the former centre back against a Tottenham XI.

Robinson 
lined up alongside David Ginola, Edgar Davids, Teddy Sheringham and 
Dimitar Berbatov, as well as other former White Hart Lane favourites.

Former Spurs captain King scored from the spot as his Guest XI won 6-3 against Spurs.
