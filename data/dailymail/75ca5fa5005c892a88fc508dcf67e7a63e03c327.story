This is the teenage air hostess who was killed when an illegal immigrant ploughed into her car on a motorway before giving false details to police and going on the run.

Charlotte Smoker, 19, died after Pakistani-born Zahid Masood, 47, drove into her stationary car on the M25 while making a mobile telephone call in November 2003.

Today Zahid Masood, 47, was sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of causing Miss Smoker's death by dangerous driving.

Miss Smoker's mother Michelle sobbed in court as she watched the man who killed her daughter jailed, before saying: 'The pain never goes and never will go, we just get better at bearing it.'

Masood, who had no insurance, had ploughed into Miss Smoker’s Fiat Cinquecento car close to junction four of the M25 near Shoreham in Kent.

Miss Smoker, who worked for Ryanair and was engaged to her boyfriend, had dialled 999 and the hazard lights were flashing on her car when Masood, who was driving a company car in the outside lane, smashed into her.

Masood, who only had a provisional driving licence and should not have been driving on the motorway, was living in the UK under a false name at the time, which he gave to police before fleeing Britain for Pakistan soon after the accident in November 2003.

He later moved back to the UK, and was living with his family in Lower Stoke near Rochester, in Kent, under his real name when his cover was blown.

The court heard that Masood was a Pakistani national but had been living in the UK with his Romanian girlfriend Marinela using the identity of South African-born 'Ahmed Mukhtar'.

Last November, nine years after the 
crash, Masood was arrested after British police discovered first his 
real name and secondly the fact that he was living back in the UK.

After failing to track down 'Ahmed Mukhtar', UK police tried to track him down via his Romanian girlfriend.  Police in Romania told them she had married a man named Zahid Masood in Romania in 2004, and when they saw the wedding pictures, officers realised he was the man they were after.

They then discovered that Masood and Marinela were back in England, living with their two young children near Rochester in Kent, and he was a parent governor at Hundred of Hoo Primary School.

This week in court Masood admitted perverting the course of justice by giving a false name and leaving the UK, but he had denied causing death by dangerous driving.

Miss Smoker, from Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire, was driving on the M25 from Guildford in Surrey to Stansted airport.

The court heard that witnesses saw her sitting in her car apparently making a telephone call, presumably to get help, shortly before Masood drove into her.  It was not clear why she had stopped, although evidence was given that one of her rear tyres was deflated.

Prosecutor Allister Walker said a lorry driver had described Masood's Ford Focus, in which was also Marinela, passing him at an estimated 80-90mph, heading straight for Miss Smoker's Fiat.

He said: 'He saw the collision. The car braked but it was far too late. It collided with the rear of the Fiat and pushed it into the central barrier.'

The court heard Masood was working for Universal Workforce in Belvedere, which provides staff for food factories, and did not have permission to drive the company’s car.

He denied using his mobile, claiming his partner was on the phone to someone in Romania, but investigators showed calls had been made to a food company he dealt with in his work.

Masood, who speaks only basic English, told police: 'It was an unfortunate accident. I still can’t believe and can’t know how it happened.

'I saw the vehicle but there were no hazard lights. I didn’t realise it was stopped, it was too late for me to much brake.'

He said he left the UK because he was afraid he would be jailed and deported, and went to Romania with his partner where they married three months after the crash.

The couple, who now have two children aged seven and two, returned to the UK for good in 2007.

Asked by police why he had not handed himself into them before, Masood replied: 'Now I have small kids and imagine being far from them. I was very frightened. I was in too much distress and in too much fear of going to prison and being apart from my children.

'I can never forget this, it changed my life upside down. I couldn’t sleep at night, it would all come back every time I tried to sleep.

'Now I am feeling relieved to be facing this once and for all and to get my punishment. I didn’t come forward, that was my mistake and I very regret this.'

As Miss Smoker's family looked on, Judge Philip Statman sentenced Masood to four years’ jail for causing death by dangerous driving and nine months consecutively for peverting justice.

He told him: 'It may well have been the situation that but for the distraction because your mind was on business rather than on the road this dreadful collision with all its consequences may well have been avoided.

   'Charlotte was a daughter who made us immensely proud parents.  Masood was in this country illegally and had no compunction in his total disregard of the law and standards of Britain'

    - Ian Smoker, Charlotte's father

'You will appreciate the devastating consequences of your actions on this particular day.'

Afterwards Miss Smoker's father Ian, 52, Michele, 51, sister Hannah, 23, brother Timothy, 27, and grandfather Peter Storah, 88, thanked Kent Police for their 'hard work and tenacity' in bringing Masood to justice.

Mr Smoker, a retired RAF officer, said: 'Charlotte was a daughter who made us immensely proud parents. She was guardian to her younger siblings in the UK whilst we were in Cyprus on a military posting. She was sensible beyond her 19 years.

'Zahid Masood was in this country illegally and had no compunction in his total disregard of the law and standards of Britain.'

'He was able very easily to leave the country by altering his identity and then to return as another person to build a new life after having destroyed ours.

'Every single day when you are out you are thinking ‘who has done this’ - it’s just been very hard.'
