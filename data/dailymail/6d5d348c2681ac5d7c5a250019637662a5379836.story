A planned women's shelter for victims of domestic violence is getting an unwanted neighbor in the form of a gun range. 

Lawmakers in Washington City, Utah have approved plans for the gun range to be built next door to Adelante Village, a women's shelter that's still under construction. Once finished, the shelter will provide apartments to women and children who have fled violent situations.

The founders of the shelter, Don and Sue Kimball, are horrified by the prospect of gunshots piercing through the peace and quiet that they had hoped to provide in their safe house, The Salt Lake Tribune reports.

In August 1983, the couple's daughter, Erin, and her two small children were shot to death by their son-in-law, Erin's estranged husband.

'In that moment of insanity, a hole was torn in the soul of our family that remains so gaping that we still have difficulty breathing in the month of August,' the Kimballs wrote on the website for a foundation they started in Erin's name. 'However, it led to our passionate commitment to assist families, like Erin’s, who are fleeing domestic violence with little or no resources – often merely the clothes on their backs.'

The planned gun range will be built by Dixie GunWorx, a gun shop that moved into a building next door to the shelter in January.

The gun shop argues that it could help 
the tenants of the women's shelter by providing them with firearm skills so 
they can protect themselves.

'We have met opposition from the proposed domestic violence victims shelter to the west of us, however we feel that we will bring safety and education to the area and help prevent such tragic acts,' the gun shop posted on its Facebook page in late July.

Washington's planning commission voted against the gun range, which would be housed inside the gun shop's building, but the city council overruled that vote and approved it last month.

In response, the Kimballs have filed suit against the city asking the court to overturn the approval.
