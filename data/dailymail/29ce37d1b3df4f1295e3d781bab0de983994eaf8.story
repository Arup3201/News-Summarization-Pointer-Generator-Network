A Cheshire mother is taking legal action against a UK tour operator after her young daughter became seriously ill and was hospitalized during a family holiday at a popular Spanish resort.

Maria Dimelow, from Runcorn, said her 18-month-old daughter Amelia, who has Downs Syndrome, spent almost 48 hours in hospital when her family should have been enjoying a much needed getaway.

The 42-year-old mum said she isn’t satisfied with the way Cosmos Holidays handled her situation after she and two of her children fell ill at Club Mac Alcudia on the Balearic island of Mallorca.

The hotel has been criticised in recent days after up to 50 holidaymakers claim they were struck down by a vomiting bug during their stay.

Illness affected dozens of guests at Club Mac Alcudia and a second resort in Menorca in recent weeks, during the height of the season.

Mother-of-two Emma Watkins, 32, of Washington, Tyne and Wear, had also recently spoken to Mail Online after her daughter Faye fell ill and was hospitalised during a stay at the Club Mac Alcudia. 

Mrs Dimelow shared her story after complaining to Cosmos. Speaking of how the hotel allegedly handled the problem, she said: ‘They’ve obviously done nothing about it. I want it to be known about what’s going on. People need to know what’s happening at this resort.

‘It’s not a recent thing that’s happened. It’s been going on for a while and they’re not doing anything about it.’  

Mrs Dimelow, who provides full-time care for her 18-month-old daughter, told MailOnline Travel that her family was supposed to spend a full week at the all-inclusive family resort but their getaway was derailed just three days in.

She believes she and her daughters, Amelia and four-year-old Bethany, fell ill after eating food at the resort because it was the only place where had meals and ‘loads’ of other guests were also suffering from symptoms including vomiting and diarrhoea.

Maria Dimelow says her daughter was 'severely dehydrated' when she was admitted to hospital

She said: ‘There were people running past you being sick. There were pools of sick all over the floor.

‘A little boy ran behind me throwing up and his mum was running behind him trying to catch it. The staff were just like, “Yeah, whatever”. They didn’t seem to care.

‘It’s not fair that people are saving to go on holiday and having it ruined by being stuck in hospital and being sick.’

She estimated that at least 40 to 50 people were ill, including Amelia, whose condition deteriorated to the point where she had to be taken to hospital.

Mrs Dimelow said: ‘It was really severe. She was constantly being sick and she couldn’t even hold water down.’

She claims resort staff would not ring an ambulance.

She said: ‘We had to take a taxi to the hospital and they said we had to pay for it ourselves.’

Caroline Kaye, a spokeswoman for the resort, said the hospital is a five- to 10-minute drive from the hotel, it is faster to travel there by taxi and in most cases an ambulance will not be dispatched for stomach-related issues.

She said a representative from the tour operator normally accompanies an ill guest to hospital and pays for the taxi ride.

The hotel apologised to the family, she added. 

Ruined holiday: Carl and Maria Dimelow aren't happy with the way they have been treated

In response to recent claims by holidaymakers, Club Mac Alcudia has released a statement denying suggestions that the illness was caused by poor food hygiene or cleanliness.

The resort, which has an on-site doctor, said it took precautionary measures to contain a virus that affected 40 to 45 guests.

Those measures included closing the pool and cleaning more frequently. 

The resort's statement reads: ‘An investigation highlighted that if the illness was due to food hygiene or cleanliness there would have been a much higher proportion of guests who would have taken ill.

‘This was a viral bug and whilst the hotel brought in additional hygiene assistance and external medical assistance (in line with our Health & Safety Guidelines), we were informed that this was not a cleanliness or food-hygiene issue.’

Mrs Dimelow claims that within five minutes of her daughter being admitted to hospital, a ‘severely dehydrated’ Amelia was put on an intravenous drip.

Mrs Dimelow stayed at her daughter’s bedside while her husband Carl, a factory worker, Bethany and their eight-year-old son Ryan remained at the hotel.

She said her husband and kids spent about £160 travelling between the resort and hospital, and they were forced to walk at one point because they ran out of money.

Amelia was discharged from hospital after two days of treatment but she wasn’t her normal self, her mother said.

‘She wasn’t eating properly. To be honest, when we got out we just couldn’t wait to come home.’

The hospital stay was covered by an insurance policy the family purchased before the trip.

Mrs Dimelow said she contacted Cosmos to get her family on an earlier flight home and was told a plane was leaving in a few hours but they would have to pay for the £80 cab ride to the airport.

Because there was a short window to get to the airport, she declined and the family returned on a Saturday morning, one day ahead of schedule.

But before they left they had to continue eating at the resort because they did not have enough money to pay for meals elsewhere.

Mrs Dimelow said she is upset because Cosmos has not offered an apology and has not responded to an official complaint she filed a few weeks after she returned home, although she did speak to an employee in Mallorca and he  did not seem surprised.

‘He said, “It’s just a bug don’t worry about it”. He said it was worse the week before.’

Cosmos Holidays released a statement saying it acknowledged receipt of Mrs Dimelow’s email on the day it was sent and advised that it would carry out a thorough investigation and respond within 28 days.

About three weeks later, Cosmos Holidays was contacted by Mrs Dimelow’s solicitor.

The statement reads: ‘As this is now within legal proceedings, we cannot comment further.’ 

Looking back, Mrs Dimelow is ‘quite upset’ with resort staff who she claims refused to call an ambulance for her ill daughter, who was being treated to her first holiday abroad.

She said: ‘They didn’t seem concerned. They initially suggested (she eat) digestive biscuits. What they’re meant to do, I don’t know.’ 

After Mrs Dimelow returned home, she filed a complaint with the hotel and was offered a £600 refund as ‘a gesture of good will’, but she turned it down.

She said: ‘I thought that was a bit of an insult after what we had been through. It’s not even about the money it’s just about the fact that it’s disgusting how we’ve been treated.’

She admitted she would like to recover the entire cost of the £1,600 holiday.

Club Mac Alcudia is one of two Spanish resorts where travellers have suffered from a vomiting bug recently

The family chose the resort after reading positive reviews on TripAdvisor and getting a recommendation from a travel agent..’

Mrs Dimelow has since contacted compensation firm Your Holiday Claims, which has received complaints from dozens of tourists who claim their holidays were ruined by sickness.

Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘The continuing reports of illness at the Club Mac Alcudia are a serious concern. We have seen a large number of children, often requiring hospital treatment, affected by the outbreak.

‘Families are continuing to have their hard-earned holidays ruined by illness at the Club Mac Alcudia. We have been receiving enquiries since May 2014 and it is vital that action is taken to stop the spread of infection.’

She added: ‘It is of utmost importance that all tour operators and the hotel management take measures to ensure that illness does not continue and to protect the health of all hotel guests.’

Holidaymakers have also fallen ill at Stil Victoria Playa Hotel on the neighbouring island of Menorca

Club Mac Alcudia is one of two Spanish resorts where travellers have suffered from a vomiting bug.

The exact number of people who have fallen ill is not clear, but visitors to both resorts believe it is more than 100.

Earlier this week, two separate holidaymakers told MailOnline Travel that up to 80 guests became sick at Stil Victoria Playa Hotel on the neighbouring island of Menorca.

Travellers who were ill are writing about their horror stories and giving the resorts poor reviews on TripAdvisor.

A user named beffhukgs, from Bath, visited Club Mac Alcudia in July with his or her three young children and described the experience as ‘very disappointing’.

In a review posted Thursday, the guest wrote: ‘Our whole party caught a sickness bug and spent half of the holiday in bed.

‘Which apparently has been doing the rounds in the complex for months.’ [sic]

However, beffhukgs’ critique was sandwiched between glowing reviews from holidaymakers who did not fall victim to the stomach bug.

One review was written by a London mother, who says she plans to return to the resort, and another was posted by a Gateshead resident, who hailed the resort for providing ‘a memorable customer experience’.
