A teenage boy was nicknamed 'devil hands' and ostracised by society because he was born with a rare deformity which left his arms permanently extended.

But Mamadou, who is now 17, can finally move his left arm after an international medical charity learned of his plight and funded life-changing surgery.

For the first time in his life, the teenager's hands and arms no longer stand vertical.

And now he has been reunited with his family, who sent him 300 miles away to beg for money, because people would feel sorry for him.

Mamadou, 17, from rural Guinea in West Africa can straighten his left arm for the first time after medical charity Mercy Ships performed a life-changing operation on the teenager

Mamadou was taunted by classmates who called him 'devil hands' and 'the claw', and his family sent him 300 miles away to the capital Conakry to beg, knowing people would take pity on him. But today the teenager can move his left arm and has been reunited with his family thanks to the Hertfordshire-based charity

As a child Mamadou, from rural Guinea, in West Africa, was taunted by classmates because of his disability, the cause of which is not known. 

'Other children used to tease me,' he said. 'They called me 'devil hand' or the 'claw'.

'People didn't want to look at me, so although I could wash and dress myself I knew I'd never be able to have a normal job.'

When Mamadou was 15 his parents sent him to live 300 miles in Conakry, the capital of Guinea with an aunt, to beg.

He said: 'I was born with my elbows bent inwards and my wrists bent downwards. I couldn't straighten my arms but I learnt how to cope.

'Mum said people would feel sorry for me. She was right. I did quite well but it was a miserable life.

'As the eldest son, I wanted to support my family.' 

Describing what it was like to beg, Mamadou said: 'I wandered the streets from dusk 'til dawn.

'People handed over cash, wide-eyed at my condition.

'But I didn't want to be a beggar and dreamed of having my own market stall.'

When Mamadou discovered a ship had docked nearby in the capital, the Mercy Ship, he went to see if they could help. 

He heard there were medical staff aboard this ship who might be able to help him. So, without telling his family, he visited it.

Doctors warned Mamadou they wouldn't be able to operate on his right arm, for fear it would make his condition worse. But the teenager, pictured right with his mother and one-year-old sister said he was just delighted surgeons could do something to help him

Mercy Ships, which has a branch in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, is a charitable organisation which offers free medical care to those who would be otherwise unable to afford it.

He went alone to see a nurse for an initial consultation.

'I told the nurse I could do so much more than people thought,' Mamadou said. 'I told her I wanted to support my family through begging but I didn't want to do it forever.'

The nurse agreed treatment was necessary and Mamadou told his family.

He said: 'My condition was a huge burden on my parents.

'There was so much disappointment and shame that I had to beg for the family to survive. 

'I wanted to be certain Mercy Ships would do my surgery before I said anything to them.'

In summer 2013 his mother and one year-old sister came to stay with him, while his father continued to support the rest of the family – without Mamadou's income.

Volunteer plastic surgeon aboard the ship, Dr Tertius Venter, said Mamadou's condition was rarely seen and, due to the severity of the deformity, only his left arm could be repaired.

'If they had tried to fix my right arm, it would have only have made things worse for me,' Mamadou explained. 'I was just happy they could do anything at all.'

With only four fingers on each hand, Dr Venter not only straightened Mamadou's arm but moved a finger to create a thumb as well.

Mamadou said: 'My condition was a huge burden on my parents.'There was so much disappointment and shame that I had to beg for the family to survive'

Mamadou has now been reunited with his family and is helping his uncle run a market stall 

He said: 'I don't scare people away anymore. I can support my family properly and without shame'

During his rehabilitation, the 16 year old practiced his English with the doctors and nurses helping his recovery.

When he left, his uncle in Conakry offered him work on his market stall.

Mamadou said: 'I don't scare people away anymore. I can support my family properly and without shame. 

'One day I will own my own stall and maybe have a family of my own. I have Mercy Ships to thank for that. 

'Without them I'd still be on the streets now. They are my guardian angels.'
