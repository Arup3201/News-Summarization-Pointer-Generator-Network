Little hero: Aaron Green, 3, managed to save his mums life by calling for help using her mobile phone, despite having never used one before

A three-year-old boy saved his mother’s life by calling for help using her mobile phone - despite having never used one before.

Little Aaron Green somehow managed to call his great-grandmother when his mother Cally, 26, had a diabetic seizure.

The barmaid, from Coventry, West Midlands, had just finished a night shift at when she returned home and was gripped by a hypoglycemic attack which caused her to collapse.

Little Aaron found her the next morning lying on the floor of her bedroom and was unable to wake her.

The little boy - who does not yet know the alphabet and can only just count to ten -reached for his mother’s Blackberry phone which was lying on her bed.

It is thought he knew what to do with the phone by watching his mother use it.

He managed to scroll through the electronic address book, found his great grandmother and called her to say: 'Mummy’s sick. She’s very ill. Please come and help her.'

Her grandmother then immediately called Miss Green’s best friend, Kara McCoy, 18, who lives on the same street who ran to the house.

After finding the mother of one completely unresponsive, she phoned 999 and an ambulance crew rushed to her aid.

Six paramedics spent over two hours trying to revive Miss Green before she was taken to University Hospital Coventry.

She spent five days in an induced coma and awoke with no memory of what had happened.

She was later told she would probably have died if it had not been for Aaron’s brave actions.

She said: 'If it wasn’t for Aaron I wouldn’t be here now. I’m always nattering away on the phone so he must have seen me do that enough times and copied me. 'I’m a real chatterbox, it’s annoys all my friends but it must have been teaching him something useful. 'It’s amazing as he doesn’t know the alphabet and can barely count to ten.

'I don’t know how he did it. He managed to unlock my mobile phone, go to the address book and go straight to my nan, who brought me up, of all people.

'I find that mobile hard to use myself. The doctors said I was lucky to be alive.

'It feels like I must have been watched over by a guardian angel who was guiding him through what to do.

'I owe him everything - he deserves the world. I want everyone to know what a Superman he is.'

Miss McCoy added: 'I’ve got a key to the house, so I let myself in.

'Cally was on the bedroom floor. She must have fallen off the bed. I was scared, I didn’t know what to do. I felt helpless.

'She was moving but wouldn’t respond so I called the ambulance. Aaron was very brave and calm you wouldn’t know his age, he was coping better than me.'

The youngster received a bravery badge from his nursery in recognition of his efforts.
