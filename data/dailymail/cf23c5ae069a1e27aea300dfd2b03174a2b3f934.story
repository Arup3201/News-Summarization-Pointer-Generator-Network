Bush meat from 40 wild animals including porcupines, gazelles and bats was confiscated in a police raid on a food shop in Paris.

The 200lb haul from the Central African Republic, which also included caterpillars, was described as unfit for human consumption.

The owner of the unnamed exotic food shop, where five porcupines, 15 gazelles and 20 bats were found in three freezers, is to be questioned on suspicion of selling banned meat.

Porcupines were among the haul of animals seized from the unknown exotic food shop in Paris

Mark Powell, of the UK management body of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, said 'Without knowing the specific species concerned of porcupine, gazelle or 
bat it is difficult to say whether or not they would be granted an 
import licence.

‘But it is highly possible that they would be from 
animals on the endangered species list, therefore it would be illegal to
import or sell them.’

It is not known if food authorities would allow the meat to be sold if it was brought through official channels.

A source close to the inquiry told Le Parisien: ‘This meat came with absolutely no hygiene guarantees, and is thus unfit for consumption.’

The incident adds to controversy over animal rights in France, where exotic animals are legally used in fine dining.

The raid comes days after 200 animals were rescued from an illegal underground abattoir outside Paris that was ‘covered in blood, from floor to ceiling’.

Ducks, geese and chicken were left without food or water and ‘piled on top of one another,’ Christophe Marie from the Brigitte Bardot Foundation told TF1.

The animals were to be sold to Chinese restaurants.

In France, a maximum three-year jail term can be given for possessing illegal animals and the owner can be fined twice the value of the meat.

Endangered species were the subject – along with climate change – of trade talks in Paris last Friday, when more than 500 African and French business leaders met.
