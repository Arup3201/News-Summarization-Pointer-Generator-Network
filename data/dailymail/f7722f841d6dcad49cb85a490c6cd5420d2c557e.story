Marry me? Jennifer Williams was overwhelmed to receive marriage proposals from jihadists after revealing that she was a Muslim

A tattooed, blonde woman who grew up a Christian in Texas has been overwhelmed by marriage proposals from ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria after one of her social media posts went viral.

Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy researcher, caught the attention of thousands by joining a Twitter trend pointing out the difference between mainstream Islam and the jihadists bringing war and devastation to the Middle East.

But she was shocked to find ISIS jihadists appreciating her message - in which revealed herself as an unlikely convert to Islam.

The fighters, presumably besotted by her bright blue eyes and platinum blonde hair, were so taken with her that they started to send marriage proposals.

Miss Williams was brought up a Baptist in Texas, uses Southern slang such as 'y'all' - and admits nobody would guess she was a Muslim at first sight.

She now works for the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C.

The message which captured the attention - and hearts - of so many was first posted to just 60 people.

But within a day it had been reposted more than 11,000 times, gaining her thousands of new followers in the process, many of whose profile pictures showed them posing in front of the black flag of ISIS. 

The jihadists - many of whom post pictures of the group's atrocities and try to tempt others to join their fight - then started reaching out to Miss Williams, and even proposing.

One of her new-found followers poses with a sword in his profile picture, and has tweeted pictures showing ISIS beheading victims, as well as images of Osama bin Laden.

And, despite the obvious enthusiasm for Miss Williams's appearance, some of her new fans tried to impose their own interpretations of Islam onto her, saying she would look better with her head veiled.

Fanbase: ISIS fighters waging jihad in Syria and Iraq flooded to Miss Williams's account, seemingly taken by her Western looks, and began trying to hijack her story

The message which grabbed their attention was part of the sarcastic #MuslimApologies hashtag, a reaction from mainstream Muslims to those associating them with ISIS and demanding apologies.

In the posts, Muslims apologize for things which either they had nothing to do with - such as the outbreak of the Second World War - or which are not bad, such as scientific or mathematical advances pioneered by Islamic scholars.

But her apology, Miss Williams instead revealed her own conversion story - how she had started to read the Qu'ran for her work on terrorism - and ended up converting.

She said: 'Sorry I read the Quran to learn abt terrorist beliefs but ended up converting to Islam b/c of what it said. #MuslimApologies #sorrynotsorry'

The response - presumably because of her Western appearance - was overwhelming, propelling her into the consciousness of ISIS militants on the front lines.

Writing about her bizarre rise to fame for the New Republic magazine, she described how men from Saudi Arabia as well as ISIS-controlled lands started making approaches. 

She said: 'One guy told me how beautiful I would look in hijab (in other words, how beautiful I would look once I covered myself up and stopped looking like an infidel). Another just straight up asked me to marry him.'

Miss Williams also found that her image - which some Muslims blurred to adhere with their modesty rules - was being used to tout her as an ISIS supporter, despite her obvious contempt for the group. 

She said: 'I, for one, do not appreciate having my conversion story used to attract more people to a repugnant ideology that spawns suicide bombings and beheadings.'

However, she said she hopes her messages on Twitter might encourage her newly-acquired fanbase to read the Qu'ran further, which she believes might make them reconsider their jihad. 

Disgust: Miss Williams expressed her distaste at how her story - and image - are being used to imply that she supports the extremists in the Middle East
