A fearless Afghan policewoman who put her life on the line for the job she 'loved' has been shot and killed in an ambush, two months after her female predecessor was also murdered.

Sub-Inspector Negar, who like many Afghans uses only one 
name, was killed when buying grass for her lambs outside her home in Lashkar Gah, Helmand 
province on Sunday when two gunmen rode up on a motorbike and fired at 
her.

Her death, one of the latest in a string of attacks on prominent Afghan women, could make it even harder to recruit female officers in a deeply conservative nation where just one per cent of the police are women.

Negar, who told a New York Times reporter recently that she 'loved her job', even though she had recently been faced with the murders of two of her female colleagues.

She told the NY Times, she saw it as her responsibility to raise morale among the 30 or so other female policewoman, according to BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.

The courageous woman was 'a heroine by any account,' he said, and on more than one occasion put her life on the line for her job.

He said she once went into a building and disarmed a sniper, and on another occasion she bear-hugged a suicide bomber to stop him from detonating.

Negar's funeral was attended by colleagues and family members, many vowing revenge on the attackers.

'They have given us warning that one of us will be killed every three months and we will be killed one by one,' fellow policewoman Malalai said.

The Taliban are believed to be behind many of the recent assaults on Afghan women.

Negar was the top policewoman in Helmand, and worked in its criminal investigation department in Lashkar Gah city.

Lt Negar was shot by unknown gunmen died from her injuries today. Two months ago, her predecessor Islam Bibi was gunned down in the same city

She had taken over the duties of Islam Bibi, a police officer shot dead in July by unknown gunmen. Ms Bibi said her own relatives had threatened her for having the job.Â 

Officials have given different ages for Negar, including 35 and 38, and varying accounts of her work history.

But her son-in-law, Faizullah Khan, said she was 41 and had two children, a son and a daughter, and that she worked for the police in the early 1990s before the Taliban movement took over the country and banned women from jobs.

Her son, police officer Hamid Khan, vowed to find her killers.

'I will serve my elders and people, my sisters and my brothers till the last drop of blood in my body. They should not believe that it is the end,' he said.

Lt Negar had been getting phone threats from people claiming to be with the Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency since being toppled in 2001

Negar's family has had several police officers, including her son, and a brother and her relatives had not objected to her work, the son-in-law said.

However, she had been getting phone threats from people claiming to be with the Taliban, who have been waging an insurgency since being toppled in 2001.

Her predecessor, Lt Bibi, was targeted by a gunman as she rode on a motorbike with her son-in-law on her way to work.

Both
were injured in the shooting but Lt Bibi died of her injuries later in 
hospital. She had won successive promotions in the police force since 
signing up in 2004.

She had been a refugee in Iran but returned to raise her family in Afghanistan in 2001.

The mother of three was one of just a few dozen women working for the force in Helmand.

She was responsible for training and recruiting women officers, as well as searching passengers at Lashkar Gah's airport.

She
told the newspaper that she joined up because of her love for 
Afghanistan and because the family were struggling to pay the bills.

However,
her family were opposed to her career and, in an interview in April, 
told The Telegraph that her brother had tried to kill her.

She said: 'My brother, father and sisters were all against me. In fact my brother tried to kill me three times.'

But despite the increased risk of being a woman police officer and said she would be proud if her daughter also signed up.

Female police officers seem to be a favourite target and several have been threatened or killed in the past few years.

Oxfam
says efforts to recruit more women into Afghanistan's police force have
met with limited success. In 2005, the national police force employed 
just 180 women out of 53,400 personnel. By July 2013, that had risen to 
1,551 out of 157,000.

The 
female officers, especially in the deeply conservative southern 
provinces, face numerous challenges, including disapproval from their 
own families. Many also face sexual harassment and assault by male 
colleagues. And some are given menial tasks such as serving tea.

In 2008, the county's most prominent policewoman was shot dead in similar circumstances.

Malalai Kakar, 41, a mother of six, was leaving for work when she was shot in her car by two men on a motorbike, in the southern city of Kandahar. Her son, 18, was seriously wounded.

Taliban rebels, who banned women from joining the police when they were in power, claimed responsibility.

Mrs Kakar was the head of the department of crimes against women in the city and one of the country's most high-profile women.
