Fires at Creightons Creek near Euroa and at Lake Rowan, near Wangaratta, are still blazing out of control. 

Two fires which started close to each other at a similar time in Victoria's Bendigo region are being investigated for potential arson. 

A house was lost at Creightons Creek on Thursday, taking the tally of homes destroyed by fire in the two blazes to five. 

The fires were contained with large aircraft, started on Thursday in the small town of Mia Mia, southeast of Bendigo.

Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley says the latest two fires will be investigated and come on top of an earlier fire sparked there by a tractor on Wednesday.

Bushfires have been burning in north Eastern Victoria which are believed to have started from lightning strikes

'There's been gusts but they haven't had incredibly strong winds, and they've had some scattered showers,' State Control Centre spokeswoman Caitlin Barratt  

"There were certainly some gusts of wind up to 70km/h through that north central, north east part of Victoria in the fire affected areas, but the winds have remained about 20km/h to 30km/h."  

Two large air tankers helped contain the fire, saved a house and prevented its run through inaccessible bushland, Mr Lapsley said. 

Two blazes in the small town of Mia Mia near Bendigo are under control and no longer posing a threat to the community, despite an earlier emergency warning message. 

The favourable conditions have let firefighters to almost finish building containment lines around both fires.

Crews will work into the night to make sure the containment lines hold, and stop the fire's spread.  

Good firefighting conditions are expected on Friday, with cooler weather and moderate winds.

Mr Lapsley says the fires are posing a fair challenge to crews.  

'In northeast Victoria, it's in the high 20s, low 30s. It's temperature, but the most critical thing this afternoon is wind speed, which will move the fires around and potentially push them into areas which will be difficult to extinguish,' he said.

Highest-risk communities were doorknocked on Wednesday and made aware of the danger, he said.   

There are still 160 properties without power but they are listed to have power back before dark, he added.

Three schools have closed and the 47 students have been told they will not reopen until next year because of the fire situation. 

Three homes have been burned to the ground in Creightons Creek, with one being destroyed in Lake Rowan.

Contact a family member or friend to tell them what you plan to do now.

'It will be a very high fire danger rating in those parts of the state where those fires are,' she told AAP.

Two thousand head of stock, one house and several farm buildings were destroyed in the blaze at Lake Rowan. 

Even though the spread of this fire has slowed it is still active with many hotspots recorded especially along the south eastern edge.

Wangaratta ICC Incident Controller, Ross Williamson said fire crews are concentrating efforts on two areas of concern within the Warby-Ovens National Park. 

'The Lake Rowan fire will take a few more days to contain,' he said, and advised communities to remain vigilant and keep informed on the weather conditions and any possible changes of fire activity.

Warning have been issued to the people of  neighbouring communities Peechelba, Almonds, Bungeet, Goorambat and Chesney, who may see smoke from their homes. 

A relief and recovery centre has been established at the Barr Reserve Community Centre, Schilling Drive, Wangaratta and evacuated pets/livestock can be taken to the Wangaratta Showgrounds via Golf Links Lane.

Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Fire Commissioner Craig Lapsley said 'Tomorrow the fire danger rating goes to very high, which still sees the fires move around on the landscape and become dangerous, but they're certainly not to the point where we see excessive winds and they'll be fast moving.'

Energy companies are also looking to restore power to 900 customers in the area when possible.

A total of 1400 firefighters are battling blazes across the state. 

A spokesperson for Fire and Emergency Services Victoria told Daily Mail Australia 'The job for tomorrow is to control the remaining fires and handle the hotspots.'
