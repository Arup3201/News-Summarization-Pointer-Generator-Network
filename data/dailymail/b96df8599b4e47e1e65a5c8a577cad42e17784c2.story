Cutting costs: Two-thirds of councils have switched off street lights to slash costs, a survey by the Campaign to Protect Rural England reveals today

Two-thirds of councils have switched off street lights to slash costs, a survey by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) reveals today.

And nearly half of the town halls admit to hitting the dimmer switch to make streets darker.

But motoring groups say the big switch off is putting lives at risk by increasing the risk of fatal and serious accidents on the road.

The CPRE report ‘Shedding Light – a survey of local authority approaches to lighting in England’ reveals more than 9 out of ten councils say they have switched off the lights to save money or energy.

But fewer than half (43 per cent) have done as a measure to reduce ‘light pollution’, which the countryside campaigners support.

Their report says that of the 71 councils which responded: ‘A total of 23 local authorities said they were involved in switching off street light, typically between midnight and 5am. And 32 said they were involved in dimming street lights in their areas.’ 

As to motivation it noted: ’Saving energy was the most important factor for local authorities who were switching off or diming street lights, followed by cost saving.’

Reducing local light pollution ‘was largely viewed as an additional benefit,’ it added.

The report highlights specific councils cutting their lighting. Bradford Council is running a dimming scheme designed to save £400,000 a year and reduce power consumption by 25per cent.

Essex County Council expects to save £1m per year by introducing a part-night lighting scheme.

North Somerset Council are planning to save £300,000 per year through part-night lighting and dimming schemes. And Sefton Council expects to save £15,000 by trialling switching off alternate streetlights.

The CPRE report says: ‘Almost a third of councils surveyed were switching off street lights, typically between midnight and 5am, and almost half of respondents said they were involved in dimming street lights in their areas.’ It said dimming schemes were ‘significantly more popular’ than switch off schemes with 68 per cent of respondents saying local communities had been very supportive.

The report said street lighting in England costs councils about £616m per year but can account for nearly a third (30per cent) of their carbon emissions.

But the AA says councils switching off street-lights to save money are putting lives at risk. Experts predict at least 750,000 street lights are being turned off or dimmed to save money and reduce emissions.

Warning: AA president Edmund King has warned that councils switching off street-lights to save money are putting lives at risk

Recent research suggests that road casualties in areas where street lights have been turned off have risen by 20 per cent in four years, bucking a national trend of falling road casualties and raising fears that cost-cutting and carbon emissions targets are claiming lives.

The AA said its own research showed that while night-time accidents in bad weather on 30mph urban roads had been slashed by 15.6per cent over the past five years, the fall was just 2 per cent in areas where street lights have been switched off or are not present.

The AA said official statistics revealed that, on darkened 40mph built-up roads, accidents in the wet, snow or ice were down 21.8per cent where there was lighting, but by only a quarter of that - 5.2per cent - where there was not.

It noted that, between 2007 and 2012, a 19.6per cent reduction in road accidents on town and city roads with street lights shrank to just 8.8 per cent where drivers and cyclists travelled in darkness.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Worse accident rates on roads with street lights turned off or not present is an insidious threat that has crept in literally under the cover of darkness. Roads that are safe when lit can become unsafe with the lights switched off.

‘With an extra casualty here and there, it is difficult to spot a creeping overall trend that might suggest something is dangerously wrong with a blackout.’ 

But the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) insists more action is needed by councils to tackle light pollution, particularly in the countryside.

Emma Marrington, CPRE’s ‘dark skies’ campaigner, said: ‘We often hear concerns that changing street lighting can impact on public safety but our research revealed no evidence to support this.

'We’re not advocating changes where they’ re not appropriate, but why shine bright lights on residential streets, quiet roads and open countryside throughout the night when it’s not needed? 

‘Genuine dark starry nights are becoming harder and harder to find which is why councils should take action to control it now.’

The report makes eight recommendations including: preserving dark skies by having a presumption against new lighting in existing dark areas; allocating lighting zones to help determine where streetlights should and should not go; and preventing ‘inappropriate and badly designed development’ that masks views of the night sky.

The report says some supposedly eco-friendly low-energy LED (light emitting diode) street-lighting – sometimes criticised as ‘flying saucer lights’ - ‘has been linked with serious effects on human health’ and can create glare.

It says councils should give ‘careful consideration’ to the type of LED lighting they use and ‘consider the potential impacts that higher temperature blue rich lighting has on ecology and human health.’ (ends) - winmail.dat
