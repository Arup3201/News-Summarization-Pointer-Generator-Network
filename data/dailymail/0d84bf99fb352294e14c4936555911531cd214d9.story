An inmate has boasted on Facebook of smoking cannabis in prison by using a mobile phone illegally smuggled in.

David Wibberley, 23, posted updates on the social network  at HMP Haverigg in Cumbria, where he is serving time for possession of the Class B drug.

He is now likely to have time added to his sentence for breach of prison rules.

In posts easily seen online, he boasted of 'chilling' in his 'pad', as well as 'skinning up' cannabis joints and being stoned or as he called it: 'whiffed out me 'ed'.

He also says he is: 'on d book' - slang for Facebook - which is 'jus ow jail shud b'.

On Sunday he posted: 'yooo bk on d book! nice! nice! Jus chilin in hmp haverigg! NICE!

'Jus chilin in hmp wid nas on whiffed out me ed on d book! nice!”

'Before going on to post: “yano wot am finkin...it skin up agen!

'proper whipped chilin in me pad in hmp on d book jus ow jail shud b haha nice!'

Boasts: Wibberley went on Facebook on a phone smuggled into jail to tell friends of his exploits

Good times: Wibberley added that he was enjoying life in jail

Friends contacted Wibberley asking what he had been up to and he revealed he had been arrested in February and hopes to be released from jail by May.

Before his current jail term, Wibberley, 23, of Liverpool, was sentenced to four years eight months in prison for his part in a series of armed raids between March 8 and April 15, 2008.

Wibberley’s Facebook page has now been deactivated and although the Ministry of Justice said they were unable to comment on individual cases, it is standard practice for inmates to have time added to their sentence for breaking the rules.

A Prison Service spokesman said: “Prisoners have no access to the internet and are barred from updating Facebook while serving their sentence, or asking others to do so from outside prison. If they do, their accounts will be terminated.

“It is a criminal offence to have a mobile phone in prison and we work hard to keep them out. Any prisoner found in possession of one will be dealt with appropriately.”

A HMP Haverigg spokesman said he was unable to comment on the incident.

Wibberley admitted two counts of robbery when he appeared at Warrington Crown Court in January 2009, following raids in Runcorn and Widnes that involved threatening staff with hammers, knives, a metal post, and a wooden plank.

In March 2012 armed robber Michael Haggan appealed for penpals using a Blackberry from his prison cell in HMP Haverigg, which resulted in him serving extra jail time.
