Rock On Ruby had his odds for the World Hurdle halved after his two-and-a-half-length defeat of Vaniteux in the Dornan Engineering Hurdle at Cheltenham.

Coral make the Harry Fry-trained 10-year-old an 8-1 shot to win at the same track in March.

But history is against him. Rock On Ruby won the 2012 Champion Hurdle and the only horse to win both that two-mile contest and the three-mile World Hurdle is Merry Deal.

Rock On Ruby trainer Harry Fry hopes the 10-year-old can return to win the World Hurdle in March

He won the Champion Hurdle in 1957 and the World Hurdle, or the Spa Hurdle as it was known then, in 1962.

Rock On Ruby still has to prove his stamina, but Thursday’s effort under jockey Noel Fehily, along with his win in the two-and-a-half-mile Relkeel Hurdle at Cheltenham last month, have encouraged Fry that it is a worthy target.

The trainer said: ‘Last season this race was won by Annie Power and she finished second in the World Hurdle. And the Relkeel was won by More Of That, who won the World Hurdle. We have won the two of them, so what better trials to run in?’

Fry, whose novice hurdle winner Thomas Brown heads to the Albert Bartlett Novices’ Hurdle, will not run Rock On Ruby before the Festival.
