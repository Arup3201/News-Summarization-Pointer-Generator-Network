A Detroit father accidentally killed his one-year-old daughter while backing a car from the driveway of the family's eastside home.The heartbroken family of Jean Foster, who was almost two years old, say they are struggling to come to terms with losing the youngest member of their family. Detroit police Officer Keisha Beasley-Dorsey says that the baby's father didn't realize the child was behind his car when she was struck and rolled over about 5:30 p.m. Thursday May 8.

Tragic: Baby Jean Foster was accidentally run over and killed by her father on their driveway

Sergeant Michael Woody tells The Detroit News that the girl's older brother yelled for their father to stop and administered CPR on his sister after she was hit.

Despite his desperate efforts, baby Jean was pronounced dead on arrival at a Detroit hospital.

Woody says it was not immediately clear if the girl made it out of the home on her own or if someone let her outside.

Her father had been washing the car outside the family home on the 19100 block of Waltham near 7 Mile and Hoover on Detroit’s east side before the accident.

Little Jean was the baby in a family of eight children.

The family has yet to finalize funeral arrangement for the beloved baby and is seeking donations to cover the cost.

Affectionately nicknamed 'Miss Jean,' the little girl was a beloved member of her family.

Her favorite song was 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams, and she'd dance and giggle every time she heard it, Jean's family told The Detroit Free Press.

'She had the biggest smile and was very vibrant,' said her sister Terrika Foster, 29. 'She really had a personality of her own.'

'This is one of the most saddest days that I can recall,' Detroit Police Captain Darwin Roche told Fox 2.

Officers were deeply moved by the loss and have been checking in with the family daily to support them.

'We’re trying to make sure that her arrangements will be taken care of, but unfortunately, we didn’t have life insurance for her,' Terrika Foster said.

The family has started a Give Forward fundraiser online to raise money for funeral costs for Jean Foster.

In an effort to prevent tragic accidents like this one ever occurring, starting in 2018 rear-view cameras will be required in all new vehicles. The law is expected to save the lives of more than 100 children every year.
