The ups and downs of life as Prime Minister have taken their toll throughout history. But the problem may be more literal for David Cameron.

He’s apparently having trouble with his knees – which may explain the appearance of a physiotherapist outside No 10 Downing Street on Tuesday.

The unnamed woman was photographed departing around 8am carrying a fold out, portable treatment table after arriving an hour earlier.

Downing Street refused to comment on the photograph last night. But it is understood the physiotherapist may have been called in to work on Mr Cameron’s knees.

Last week he sported support bandages on both legs as he got a soaking during a race along a swollen icy stream in the Cotswolds.

Mr Cameron, 48, was taking part in the Great Brook Run, close to his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire.

A Downing Street source told the Mail at the time: ‘He took the precaution of using the knee supports this year for protection from sharp stones submerged in the water.’

It has previously been reported by the Mail on Sunday that Mr Cameron has been visited at No 10 by a Harley Street physiotherapist for a series of £250-an-hour sessions to help him tackle ‘muscle and joint stiffness’ in 2011.

It was two years later that Mr Cameron told how he had injured his back forcing him to cancel plans to hunt deer during a holiday in Scotland. 

He also had a painkilling injection after suffering a protruding disc in his spine. 

Mr Cameron said at the time that his ‘phenomenally bad back’ had been a ‘bore’.
