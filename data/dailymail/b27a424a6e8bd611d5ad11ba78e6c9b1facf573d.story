Tragic: An asylum seeker has admitted that he caused the death of aspiring young model Rebecca Caine, 20, pictured, when he drove the wrong way on the M62 motorway

An asylum seeker today admitted causing the death of a 'beautiful' aspiring young model when he drove the wrong way on a motorway.

Wilfred Museka 31, had been at the wheel of his Renault Megane when he hit a Chevrolet Matiz on the M62 near to Milnrow, Rochdale.

Rebecca Caine 20, from Leeds, who was a passenger in the Matiz died, and three others were hurt in the crash on September 15.

Museka, who is thought to be from Zimbabwe, pleaded guilty to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving when he appeared at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court today.

Ms Caine’s family who live in Leeds, said they had lost a 'bright light' in their lives.

In
a statement issued after the tragedy they said: 'As you can imagine our
lives are shattered and our hearts are broken into pieces.

'She
was a beautiful girl with her whole life ahead of her. She was embarking on a
modelling career and would be finishing her final year of her business 
degree at Leeds University.

'Rebecca was a bright light that attracted everything to her with her infectious laugh and her beaming smile.

'She
saw the best in everyone and was loved by hundreds of friends. The 
worst part is the emptiness and the total waste of a beautiful life. She
was only 20 when she died.

'She was our little now she is our little angel. Something somewhere has failed us.'

Museka, from Clayton, Manchester, will be sentenced next month, and has been remanded into custody until the date of the hearing.
