Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal has hit back at claims suggesting he had sustained another injury to his knee while on international duty with Chile.

Reports had suggested that Vidal, who was linked with a move to Manchester United during the summer transfer window, was forced out of a training session in Miami after aggravating his knee.

However Vidal has since taken to Twitter to refute suggestions he was facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines.

'My knee is perfect,' Vidal wrote on his personal social media account. 'Please stop inventing [information]. Come on Chile.'

The 27-year-old required a knee operation towards the end of last season and appeared to be lacking fitness at the World Cup.

Chile ace Vidal started Juventus' opening Serie A match against Chievo before linking up with his international team-mates.

Vidal will be hoping his injury nightmare is behind him in order to establish himself as one of the world's best midfielders.
