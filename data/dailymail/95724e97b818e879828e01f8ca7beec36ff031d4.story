He shouldn't give up his day job any time soon.

Greens Senator Scott Ludlam has tried his hand at rapping in an inexplicable and painfully awkward video about the G20 - dropping the f bomb and swearing about the Abbott Government's policy on internet privacy.

The video shows senator Ludlam slamming the Abbott government's proposed mandatory data retention laws ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane next month.

Senator Ludlam, from Western Australia, teamed up with Melbourne’s Juice Rap News’ in their latest YouTube video, which has received over 25,000 views after it was published on Thursday.

Politician by day, rapper by night: Greens Senator Scott Ludlam speaks in the Senate chamber at Parliament House in Canberra

Wearing a white button up dress top with a black blazer in the video, senator Ludlam is introduced as a ‘hippie and greenie -  trying to stop the fun’ by a rapper who plays a correspondent named ‘Ken Oathcarn'.

‘Why is it when in the senate - whenever you speak, the whole room empties and all the senators leave?’ Oathcarn raps.

While pointing the finger at Oathcarn, senator Ludlam responds: ‘A better question is why is the senate empty yet my words go viral when they arrive on the internet?’

Oathcarn continues to rap, saying ‘Australia’s about to be the first great nation to pass laws for mandatory data retention’ before senator Ludlam intervenes: ‘a fascist f***fest of Orwellian proportions’.

‘Oh come on mate, you’re not going to be a negative nerd and vote against all of Tony’s [Abbott] incredible work?’ Oathcarn raps.

‘I’ll go full Gandalf on this government’s a***. Smack down their laws with a dose of – you shall not pass,’ senator Ludlam rhymes.

‘I can’t do it solo, that’s why I’ve issued a blanket call out to the internet – to stand up and be counted. The net is our best bet to combat to render on tactics.’

And it got even better when senator Ludlam walked into the last scene, dressed as the Lord of the Rings wizard

And it got even better when senator Ludlam walked into the last scene, dressed as the Lord of the Rings wizard as he zaps at a rapper dressed as Prime Minister Tony Abbott off the screen, along with correspondent Oathcarn and two girls, believed to be acting as his daughters.

Senator Ludlam told news.com.au that Juice Rap News approached him  and he agreed to be part of the video because he respected their work.

‘We could be less than a week away from mandatory data retention laws. It’s a tongue-in-cheek tactic, but it has a serious message behind it,’ he said.

The video was also posted on Senator Ludlam’s official Facebook page, as well as his Twitter account, tweeting ‘yes this actually happened’ on Friday morning.
