A wine expert has blasted the White House for serving 'cheap' vintages that cost about $50 or less at Tuesday's state dinner for the French President.

It comes as little surprise that the wines served at the gala were all from American vineyards, but wine blogger and New York University professor Tyler Colman criticized the choices for being driven by the budget at opposed to the quality of the wine.

'The Obama White House seems to have made a conscious choice to bring down the price of the wines. This is unfortunate: given the White House policy of only serving American wines, they really should showcase the best of what America is making, irrespective of price,' Mr Colman wrote on his blog, Dr Vino.

Gala glasses: The State Dinner held on Tuesday at the White House was in honor of French President Francois Hollande's trip to America

'Sure, State Dinners are expensive, but has anyone taken a look at the Department of Defense budget and procurement lately? Fine wine at a state dinner is the equivalent of a few toilet seats and wrenches at the DoD.'

The wine in question included a 2011 white Morlet 'La Proportion Doree' from Napa Valley, a Chester-Kidder red blend from Washington state and a Thibaut-Jannison dessert chardonnay from Monticello, Virginia.

The Napa white retails between $45 and $60 per bottle, the red blend averages around $50 and the dessert wine comes in as the cheapest at $30.

One explanation for the price-conscious selections is that the Obama administration has been criticized for going the other direction in the past.

Filled with symbolism: The food and wine selections were chosen for purposeful reasons, like salad and honey from the White House garden and vineyards from French-born winemakers

Second course: A winter garden salad with mixed radishes, baby carrots and lettuce topped with a red wine vinaigrette

Main Course: Dry-aged rib eye beef with blue cheese from Jasper Hill Farm and charred shallots, oysters, mushrooms and chard

Dessert: Hawaiian chocolate malted ganache with vanilla ice cream and tangerines

At the state dinner held for Chinese President Hu Jintau in January 2011, the White House selected a Washington state cabernet sauvignon that sold for $115-per-bottle (though some reports say that the price shot up to $399 at the time of the dinner).

After the blowback, the White House opted not to list the wine that was paired with the meal when British Prime Minister David Cameron came to America in March 2012.

On top of being price conscious, the White House decision makers tried to make sure that there were symbolic connections that explained their selections, as the winemakers at both the Morlet and the Chester-Kidder vineyards grew up in France.

Cheers: Wine critic and professor Tyler Colman (right) said that the White House based their selections on politics rather than prestige of the wine itself, which he argued should be important when serving the French

The Virginia wine was a nod to President Obama and President Hollande's day trip to President Thomas Jefferson's estate at Monticello on Monday. Jefferson was the American ambassador to France before taking over the White House.

Mr Colman, however, felt that the French connections were 'modest at best'.

'These formal occasions seem guided more by politics or the lack of curiosity of the White House Usher,' he wrote on Twitter.
