West Ham are monitoring Marseille defender Nicolas N'Koulou as they prepare to lose Winston Reid.

While Sam Allardyce was ensuring his team were riding high in third position in the Premier League on Sunday, clubs scouts were dispatched to watch versatile Cameroon international N'Koulou.

West Ham are bracing themselves for offers on Reid who has attracted interest from Arsenal and Everton. He is out of contract in the summer and the chances of him agreeing a new deal look slim.

West Ham are reluctant to sell but will do should someone offer £6million or more in the January window.

The 24-year-old N'Koulou played in the middle of a three man defence as Marseille beat Metz 3-1 on Sunday.

West Ham are flying high in the Premier League this season, having won eight of their first 15 games. They beat Swansea 3-1 on Sunday to move up to third.
