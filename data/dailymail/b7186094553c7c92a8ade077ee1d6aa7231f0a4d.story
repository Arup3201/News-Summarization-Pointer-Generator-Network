The way is finally clear for Russia and Qatar to stage the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after nothing emerged from Michael Garcia’s corruption report that could force a re-vote.

FIFA agreed unanimously at their summit here for the Garcia findings, where legally possible, to be published in full — but only after being assured there is no explosive detail within the 430 pages that would require another World Cup election.

Garcia had sent hapless FIFA into meltdown — first by disowning ethics committee colleague Hans-Joachim Eckert’s summary of his report and then resigning his FIFA role on the eve of the executive committee’s meeting in Morocco. This was after FIFA’s appeals committee turned down his Eckert complaint.

But Houdini-like FIFA chairman Sepp Blatter, taking full credit for persuading his executive to support publication without opposition, saw the day as a personal triumph. After the meeting he echoed the famous quote attributed to former British PM Jim Callaghan: ‘Crisis? What Crisis?’

Blatter said: ‘We have been in crisis — the crisis has stopped. There will be no revote, the decision has been taken. I managed to get the executive to back publication under certain conditions. The most important thing is to share the will of the president and for the executive to move forward.’

However it will be some time before a heavily redacted Garcia report does see the light of day, when the lawyers have had their say and all those who spoke to Garcia under privacy agreements have been protected.

And the eventual published report is likely to be a damp squib, soft on Russia and Qatar transgressions, while focusing on individual ethics codes violations.

England’s doomed 2018 bid is likely to remain in the firing line as it was in Eckert’s disputed summary of Garcia’s work.

FIFA will also wait until the personal investigations ordered by Garcia are completed before publishing. The investigations into five individuals suspected of breaching the code will now be carried out by Garcia’s successor as FIFA ethics investigator, Cornel Borbely.

Those under the microscope are German football great and former FIFA executive member Franz Beckenbauer, three current members of the FIFA executive; Spain’s Angel Maria Villar Llona, Belgium’s Michel D’Hooghe and Worawi Makudi of Thailand, as well as Chilean Harold Mayne-Nicholls, who led the delegation assessing the 2018 and 2022 bids.

Only six of the 25-strong executive had been expected to support Garcia’s publication before they convened in the ballroom of La Mamounia hotel in Marrakech — once a favourite of Sir Winston Churchill.

So Blatter — as he demonstrated afterwards — was overjoyed to sway the doubters not to oppose the transparency. Even the three still being probed by FIFA, who have the most to lose, agreed not to rock the boat.

Blatter said: ‘What do you do to convince people? To convince people is to say what is so important — that we are the guardians of the FIFA statutes and regulations. There comes a situation where there must be unity and a determination to end a situation that has created a lot of problems.

‘It’s not the first time that I have found myself as president of FIFA in a critical situation. When something is wrong, we fight and I had big fighters today on the executive.’ Germany’s Theo Zwanziger was the most vocal at the meeting in favour of publication. But, as it turned out, there was no need for a vote or for his motion to be debated. 

The executive were happy to rely on the recommendation of compliance chief Domenico Scala, who considered there was nothing big enough in it to take the World Cups away from Russia and Qatar.

Scala, before he came to that verdict, had taken legal advice from Swiss professor Anton Heini, from Zurich University and German professor in sport at Cologne University, Martin Nolte, who are now the seventh and eighth people to have seen the full Garcia findings.

Scala would not estimate how many of those 430 pages would survive the redaction process, but did say: ‘There is nothing in the report that says a re-vote is needed.’

He did recommend that FIFA should never again vote for two World Cup stagings at the same time, and suggested rules should be tightened regarding gift protocol, as well as friendly match procedures and the roles of bid consultants.

He also said promotion of football development projects outside the bid country should be stopped, there should be official audits of bids and there must be a legal obligation to store documents. Russia scandalously said their leased bid computers had been returned and all information destroyed, when Garcia came knocking during the investigation process.

Meanwhile, the investigation into the five individuals will be fast-tracked according to Blatter, to avoid a repeat of the length and cost of Garcia’s investigation.

The American’s two-year study involved round-the-world travel at a reported cost of $6million, before culminating with FIFA’s controversial report.

Garcia, among others, calls for the report to be published in full and says of FIFA: ‘(The) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard... (it) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution.’

NOVEMBER 2014
