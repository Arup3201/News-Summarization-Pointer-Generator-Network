A teenager held on suspicion of attempted murder was released from prison by mistake, it has been revealed.

The Metropolitan Police offered a £10,000 reward yesterday for information leading to the arrest of Jordan Francois after he was mistakenly allowed out of Wandsworth Prison in London.

But a force spokesman said the 18-year-old was arrested at 5.35am today in Edmonton, north London, and is now in custody.

Scotland Yard had said Francois was 'unlawfully at large' from Wandsworth Prison, where he was on remand for attempted murder.

The Prison Service said last night that it would 'formally investigate' the incident.

A spokesman said: 'Releases in error are a very rare but regrettable occurrence.

'The number of incidents have fallen significantly in recent years with figures down by a quarter compared to 2009/10 but every incident is taken extremely seriously and we are not complacent.'

After his release, police released an appeal for information describing Francois as 6ft 4ins and stocky and with links to north London. 

Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, who was leading the investigation, called for anyone with information to contact officers 'immediately'.
