Up to two million obese Britons will be eligible for weight-loss surgery on the NHS under new guidelines.

The health watchdog NICE is telling doctors to suggest the operations to all patients above a given weight with type 2 diabetes.

If all those in that group took up the offer it would cost the NHS £12billion.

NICE hopes to treble the number of such procedures carried out by the health service to at least 15,000 a year – an extra annual outlay of £90million. The move comes as the NHS struggles to meet targets for what many would regard as more urgent operations.

It was revealed in April that nearly three million people were on waiting lists for surgery or other hospital procedures, including almost 550 who had been waiting for more than a year.

Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, said: ‘The need for so much bariatric [weight loss] surgery graphically illustrates the price of failure in preventing obesity.

'Do we want a future where our children die younger than their parents and where the NHS is brought to its knees by entirely avoidable illness? That’s the stark choice facing our country.’

NICE has concluded procedures such as gastric bypass operations and gastric bands are the best way to treat obesity, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.

But experts accused the watchdog of ignoring ‘swathes of evidence’ that cutting calories is just as effective and far less expensive than surgery.

The NICE guidance advises anyone with a Body Mass Index over 30 and type 2 diabetes should be considered for surgery. This is equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 13st 9lb, or a 5ft 11in man at 15st 6lb.

The NHS already spends £10billion a year treating type 2 diabetes and around one in six hospital beds are taken up by a patient with the condition.

NICE states surgery can drastically improve the illness, prevent complications and in some cases reverse it.

Professor Mark Baker, of the watchdog’s Centre for Clinical Practice, said: ‘The numbers of people classified as obese has nearly doubled over the last 20 years and continues to rise.

‘It is a major issue, if not the major issue, for the health service in the coming years.

‘The value of weight loss surgery to diabetics is one of the best we have come across in our guidance … we think this is one of the things the NHS should invest more in.’

But Professor Iain Broom, of the Centre for Obesity Research and Education at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, said: ‘They have missed swathes of evidence.

‘The NICE guidance could send tens of thousands of Britons towards unnecessary surgery, with its known morbidity and mortality, and costing taxpayers many millions of pounds, when all that is required is a different dietary and lifestyle approach, including the use of low carbohydrate diets and low, and very low, calorie diets.

‘While surgery has its place, it must remain a last resort.’

Barbara Young, chief executive of charity Diabetes UK, added: ‘While weight loss surgery for type 2 diabetes is an important treatment option, it should not be seen as the definitive remedy that can fix the type 2 epidemic on its own.

‘In particular, it makes no sense that the NHS is currently spending more on bariatric surgery than it is on preventative measures to stop people from getting type 2 diabetes in the first place.’

Obese children with type 2 diabetes could be offered the operations but it is only recommended once they have been through puberty so the youngest eligible patients would be 12 or 13.

The most effective procedure is a gastric bypass operation whereby surgeons create a small pouch at the top of the stomach.

They connect this directly to the small intestine, bypassing the rest of the stomach so that patients only need small amounts of food before they feel full.

This causes them to lose weight very quickly and, crucially, it also lowers their blood sugar – which is a key factor in tackling diabetes.

The type 2 form of the condition causes kidney failure, strokes and loss of sight, and sufferers’ feet may need to be amputated due to nerve damage. NICE said that 60 per cent of diabetic patients no longer need medication after weight-loss procedures and that the remainder are able to cut back on pills or insulin injections.

But not all sufferers will want the surgery and many cash-strapped NHS trusts may refuse to fund it.

There is also a risk – around one in 1,000 patients die from a cardiac arrest, while one in 100 suffer either blood clots or internal bleeding.

About 4,200 weight-loss operations are carried out on the NHS each year, including around 20 on children as young as 13.

The most common are gastric bypass operations but others include gastric bands or gastric balloons.
