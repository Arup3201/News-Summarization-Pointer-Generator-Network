India's launch of a space craft is proof it no longer needs British aid, campaigners have claimed.

Delhi’s orbiter mission – part of a £600million space programme – blasted off this morning with an orbiter which will survey Mars.

But the TaxPayers’ Alliance said it was wrong for a country to explore other planets while receiving UK aid, in India’s case £280million a year until 2015.

‘It’s atrocious that taxpayers are still handing money to a country rich enough not just to have its own space programme, but one that is blasting off to Mars,’ said Jonathan Isaby, the group’s political director.

‘If India can afford this kind of expenditure then it does not need a penny of British taxpayers’ money, especially when departments back home rightly have to cut their spending.

‘It’s difficult for taxpayers to believe the Department for International Development uses their cash wisely when they see it spent helping launch spacecraft to the red planet, rather than going to the world’s poorest.’

Ministers are committed to increasing overall aid spending by 30 per cent to £11.3billion this year and are expected to hit their target of spending 0.7 per cent of national income on aid.

Unlike spending on policing, prisons 
and defence, which have been slashed to cut the deficit, the aid budget 
has enjoyed year-on-year increases.

By next year, the bill will be £12.6billion a year – more than the £12.1billion spent on policing.

But a recent poll found more than 60 per cent of voters believe the cash is wasted.

India
spends vast sums on defence and even has its own overseas aid 
programme, which cost £328million a year. Under Labour, India became the
biggest net recipient of British aid, receiving £421million in 2010.

Despite
the country’s rapid economic development, then international 
development secretary Andrew Mitchell decided to approve a further 
£1.1billion in aid over the following four years.

If the rocket reaches Mars, India will become only the fourth country or group to reach the red planet after Russia, U.S. and Europe

Last year his successor Justine Greening announced the outlays would end in 2015.

India’s
then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee embarrassed the Government by 
suggesting Britain’s aid payments were ‘a peanut in our total 
development expenditure’.

If
successful, the space mission will put India in an elite group of four,
with the US, the EU and Russia, to have sent space craft to Mars. The 
mission follows the launch of a lunar craft in 2008.

Jean
Drèze, a leading development economist, has said: ‘It seems to be part 
of the Indian elite’s delusional quest for superpower status.’

A
spokesman for the Department for International Development said: ‘Not a
penny of British taxpayers’ aid money has gone on India’s space 
programme.

'India’s recent progress means that all 
financial grants from the UK to India will cease in 2015, after which we
will focus on providing help in the form of private sector expertise 
and technical assistance that will also ultimately benefit British 
businesses and jobs.'

Nigeria – another country with a space programme – also receives UK aid, worth £300million this year alone.

China's Shenzhou-10 rocket blasts off from the Jiuquan space centre in June

India's bid to be the first nation since Russia, the U.S. and the EU to reach Mars could spark an Asian space race.

Experts say its ambitious space programme has been fuelled by competition with China and concerns about its neighbour's civilian and military space technology. 

‘The reality is that there is competition in Asia. There's the angle of the potential space race,’ said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.

Although India's programme is largely for peaceful purposes, it has increasingly realised the need to grow its deterrence capability after China's 2007 anti-satellite missile test.

‘That was a wake-up call for India,’ said Rajagopalan. ‘Until then we were taking it easy.’

China's space programme is far ahead of India's, with bigger rockets, more launches and equally cost-effective missions.

It is working to create a space station and in June sent a manned rocket - the Shenzhou-10 - to the Tiangong (Heavenly Palace) 1, a trial space laboratory module. 

Both Chinese and Indian launches have been carefully staged to boost national pride.

President Xi Jinping told the astronauts: 'You are the pride of the Chinese people, and this mission is both glorious and sacred.'

India's mission was announced on the country's Independence Day last year, soon after China's bid to reach Mars failed. 

Dr James Clay Moltz, professor at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School, told CNN: 'I believe India's leadership sees China's recent accomplishments in space science as a threat to its status in Asia, and feels the need to respond.'

However officials have dismissed the suggestion that India raced to prepare Tuesday's launch to trump China's failed attempt at Mars.

‘We're not in a race with anybody,’ said ISRO spokesman Deviprasad Karnik, noting that the voyage can happen only every 26 months, when the spacecraft can travel the shortest distance between Earth and Mars.

‘The mission to Mars has to be organised whenever there is an opportunity available.’
