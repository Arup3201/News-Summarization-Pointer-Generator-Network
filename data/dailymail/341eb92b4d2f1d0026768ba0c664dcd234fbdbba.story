Survivors of the avalanche in which three Britons died have described their terror as they were thrown 800ft down the mountain by the overwhelming force.

One said it had ‘felt like being in a washing machine’.

The avalanche struck in the French Alps as 28 climbers roped together in small groups made their way up the 14,649ft Mont Maudit – which translates as ‘cursed peak’ – in the dark.

Nine were swept to their deaths by a block of snow 60ft high and 500ft wide in the early hours of Thursday.

The Britons who died were close friends John Taylor, 48, and Steve Barber, 47, who lived on the same street in the village of Poppleton, near York, and their guide, 55-year-old Roger Payne.Speaking from his hospital bed yesterday, survivor Daniel Rossetto, 63, a French mountain guide with 30 years’ experience, said: ‘I’ve never seen anything like this before.

‘I felt the snow fall down on me. We tried to resist but it pushed all the way down the slope, 250 metres (800ft).’

Mr Rossetto had set out from a mountain refuge with two Danish clients in the darkness, using torches. They were at 13,100ft following a particularly difficult route that would ultimately have taken them to the summit of Mont Blanc.

Roped together, the trio suddenly became trapped under masses of snow.

Mr Rossetto recalled: ‘At each shock, we wonder if it will get worse. It’s as if I was in a washing machine.

‘We were on the edge of the avalanche, it was our chance, while the other climbers were caught under masses of snow. The mountain is unforgiving.’

Despite suffering a dislocated shoulder, he managed to claw his way out of the snow after he was thrown down the face of Mount Maudit. He was the first to raise the alarm by calling the mountain rescue services from his mobile phone at 5.20am.

Lying in another bed at the hospital in the nearby town of Sallanches, one of his clients, Thomas Dybro, 30, from Copenhagen, told how survivors dug with their hands to rescue other victims, some with broken legs. And he described the grim task of pulling the dead out of the snow.

‘It was horrible,’ he said. ‘We were digging for one and a half hours. The snow and ice was really hard.’

Despite Mr Rossetto’s injuries he and Mr Dybro were able to walk off the mountain assisted by their rescuers.

The devastated families of the three Britons said yesterday that they had died doing what they loved.Mr Taylor and Mr Barber, whose daughters went to the same primary school, had embarked on the climb to raise money for St Leonard’s Hospice in York and Macmillan Cancer Support.

Their guide, Mr Payne was one of the UK’s most respected climbers and a former general secretary of the British Mountaineering Council.

His tearful 91-year-old mother Nellie Payne, of Hammersmith, West London, said: ‘I am devastated. My children are my life. It is heart-breaking not to be able to see my son any more.’

Mr Payne, who had developed an avalanche training programme, met his future wife, Julie-Ann Clymer, a climbing instructor from New Zealand, at the top of a mountain in South America. They married in 1983 and lived in a chalet in Leysin, Switzerland.

Mrs Payne said the pair, who had no children, were ‘inseparable’ and travelled the world together climbing some of the most dangerous and breath-taking peaks.

‘They were made for each other,’ she said. ‘They had a lovely life. Now Julie is all by herself and I don’t know what she will do.’ Miss Clymer arrived in Chamonix, the French town near Mont Blanc, yesterday afternoon from Switzerland to identify her husband.

Mr Payne’s brother Keith, 67, said: ‘He was not a risk-taker. He had so much experience and would never take people higher than was safe.

‘He was charismatic, out-going, friendly, happy-go-lucky. Our only comfort is that he died doing what he loved.’

Fellow victim Mr Barber, an accountant, had lived in Poppleton for most of his life and his parents ran the village post office before they retired. Donna Rogers, his long-term partner, with whom he has a daughter, Francesca, ten, said: ‘The family and I are all devastated at the loss of Steve and his close friend John.

‘Steve always wanted to climb Mont Blanc, an ambition that this trip was to fulfil.

‘He
had been training hard and had successfully completed several 
challenging climbs in Europe and in the UK prior to this trip.’

Finance
director Mr Taylor took up mountaineering in 1998 and had climbed Mont 
Blanc twice before. His wife Karine, with whom he had two daughters, 
Emma, ten, and Louise, eight, said she was ‘truly devastated’.

Three Germans, two Spaniards and a Swiss climber were also killed in the avalanche, and 14 people were injured.

Officials
in Chamonix said yesterday that the climbers had done ‘nothing 
imprudent’ and that the avalanche could have happened at any time.
