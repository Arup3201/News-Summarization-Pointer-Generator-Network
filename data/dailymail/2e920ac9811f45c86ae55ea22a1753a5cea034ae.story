'Britain's FBI' has refused to reveal which blue-chip companies hired corrupt private investigators, despite demands from MPs.

The Serious Organised Crime Agency said disclosing the information could undermine the financial viability of the organisations by tainting them with ‘criminality’.

The decision to protect the reputation of certain business sectors is in sharp contrast to police action against the practice among newspapers.

Private eyes: Among the practices revealed by a confidential - and now leaked - Soca report were live telephone interceptions, computer hacking, police corruption and obtaining itemised phone bills (file picture)

Last month Theresa May expressed alarm at revelations that lawyers and blue-chip firms were implicated in phone hacking, surveillance and data theft, and the hiring of private investigators to dig for information on companies and individuals.

Among the practices revealed by the confidential – and now leaked – Soca report were live telephone interceptions, computer hacking, police corruption and obtaining itemised phone bills.

The culprits allegedly include a celebrity broadcaster, a corporate giant and a wealthy businessman.

The agency’s chairman, Ian Andrews, told MPs the information had now been ‘formally classified’ because it could prejudice ‘ongoing criminal investigations’ and breach the human rights of the companies involved, it was revealed yesterday.

In response to Sir Ian’s letter, Labour 
MP Keith Vaz said he would write to every firm in the FTSE 100 and the 
top 100 legal firms to ask if they had commissioned private 
investigators and why.

Mr Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, added: ‘Soca has indicated that it is prepared to give the client list to us in confidence. This has still not been received.

'It is a disappointment that this is yet another document the committee has had to receive in secret from Soca'

‘It is a disappointment that this is yet another document the committee has had to receive in secret from Soca.

‘In view of the public interest, openness and transparency may be the only way that the public can be reassured that no one is above the law and [that] Soca have done all they can to address this issue.’

Mr Vaz said he suspected the evidence was withheld from Parliament during a previous probe into private investigators.
