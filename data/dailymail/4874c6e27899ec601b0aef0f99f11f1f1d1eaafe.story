The alleged gunman arrested for the murder of a one-year-old baby is said to have boasted of shooting the father, but soon found out otherwise.

Dequan Breland, 23, shouted to a friend 'I shot that motherfu--er!' after firing a bullet into 16-month-old Antiq Hennis last weekend, investigators have revealed. The poorly aimed shot was meant for the dead toddler's father, a gang banger with a rap sheet over 20 offenses long.

'No you idiot, you shot the baby,' that friend replied. A distraught Mr Breland fled the scene, and the state. These details emerged as the slain toddler's funeral was held Friday.

Suspects: Dequan Breland (left) and Dequan Wright (right) were taken into police custody in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on Friday in connection to a shooting in Brooklyn, New York on Sunday

Victim: Antiq Hennis was being pushed across a road in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Brooklyn by his parents at about 7.20pm yesterday when he was shot

These revelations come only a day after both Breland and accused accomplice Dequan Wright, 19, were discovered Friday in an Wilkes-Barre, PA apartment that belongs to Breland's cousin, according to The New York Post. They were taken into custody only hours after their innocent victim's funeral was held in Brooklyn.

Upon learning that he had shot dead an innocent child, Mr Breland went from boasting to crying.

'He started to cry. He was very upset and worried,' a source told the Post.

Antiq was being pushed across a 
Brooklyn street on Sunday by his father Anthony, who is believed to be a
member of the murderous Crips gang.The father has been arrested 25 times, mostly for drug-related offenses, according to court records.

'Everybody’s afraid of the father and his family,' another source told the Post.

Police
believe that the shooting was related to a disagreement between the 
suspects and Anthony Hennis, 21, though the exact argument in question 
still has not been revealed.

Devastated: Mourners attending Antiq Hennis' funeral are greeted with tears and armed police

Such a tragedy: The toddler was gunned down because of a beef his gang banger father had gunman Dequan Breland

At least one person who witnessed the horrifying shooting has fingered Mr Breland as the shooter, but the gunned-down toddler's father is refusing to cooperate with investigators, according to the Post.

The trigger-happy duo were arrested Friday after a five day, multi-state, multi-agency manhunt, with the capture detailed Friday by New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly.

'[Officers] knocked on the door and the occupants refused to open it,' Mr Kelly said during a press conference announcing the arrests.

Shell shocked: The entire city was shocked by the senseless shooting, most in attendance at the toddler's Friday funeral were in disbelief

Connected: A witness saw Wright, 19, hand the gun to Breland on Sunday night

Pulling the trigger: Breland then reportedly fired four shots, one of which hit the 1-year-old boy

Overcome: Family members and others attending the funeral were overcome with emotion

'The officers breached the door to 
gain entry. In the rear bedroom they found Dequan Breland on the floor 
and Dequan Wright lying on the bed.'

Officers tracked Mr Breland to the area because he is dating Mr. Wright's sister, she lives nearby.

The
same witness that identified Mr Breland as the shooter also said that 
Mr Wright was the one to hand him the gun just moments before he fired 
four shots, one of them into the head of an innocent child.

This was not Mr Breland's first run-in with authorities. He is currently on parole for a 2011 armed assault in upstate New York, has an open arrest warrant in Brooklyn for a weapons possession charge and has several juvenile arrests - mostly assaults, according to the Post.

Shocking: One-year-old Antiq Hennis was shot in this stroller in an impoverished area of Brooklyn last night

Pay respects: Mourners visit a memorial for Antiq Hennis in the Brownsville area of Brooklyn, New York, where the one-year-old boy was shot and killed in his stroller during a walk with his parents on Sunday

Innocent: Antiq Hennis was in a stroller being walked by his father when he was struck in the head by gunfire - the bullet was said to be meant for his dad

The family lives in Brooklyn's notorious Brownsville neighborhood, which has one of the highest concentrations of public housing, and violent crime, anywhere in the U.S.

Witness Gina Gamboa, 22, told the New York Daily News: '[The father] was screaming 'My baby got shot!' He was going crazy.'

'The baby was breathing, but his eyes were closed. It’s crazy. They just will start shooting.

'The baby’s chest was moving, but his head was tilted to the side. There was blood all over the stroller.’
