Drunk: Deborah Hambrook and Karl Hayden downed a bottle of whisky as they took care of a child

A couple were so drunk they could barely stand as they looked after an 18-month-old child after downing a bottle of whisky, a court heard today.

Karl Hayden and Deborah Hambrook were wheeling the little boy in a pushchair and at one point walked into the road with him without looking where they were going.

After Hambrook, 36, vomited onto the pavement, toppling the buggy, shoppers called police because they were worried about the child's welfare.

But the couple lashed out violently at officers, who found an empty whisky bottle in the pushchair.

A judge at Southampton Magistrates' Court today condemned their behaviour, saying they had exposed the child to 'physical risk' and 'emotional harm'.

Bystanders were alarmed at Hayden and Hambrook's behaviour as they shopped near the Lidl supermarket in Eastleigh, Hampshire on April 3.

One witness saw Hayden, 38, pushing the buggy into the road 'without awareness of the cars', according to prosecutor Bernadette Kearney.

As soon as PC Catherine Manns arrived at the scene, she received a call from PCSO Rhys McCarthy, who said the child was in danger and he needed help 'as soon as possible'.

He had seen Hambrook throw up and stagger away, which caused the pushchair to fall over, while both defendants were slurring their words and 'talking gibberish'.

But when Ms Manns went to intervene the couple lashed out, swearing and manhandling the two officers.

'Hambrook and Hayden told the officers the child's name but became instantly hostile,' Ms Kearney told the court.

'They were very vocal and using raised voices. PC Manns could tell they were both drunk. Both parties were unstable on their feed and smelt of alcohol.

'Hambrook's pupils were very small and Hayden seemed very vacant, as if there was a time delay.

'The child's hands were bright red, he was very cold to touch and had bright red cheeks. He was very quiet and was not crying at the time.'

Hambrook repeatedly tried to leave the scene, and when she disobeyed orders to stay the police tried to handcuff her.

She assaulted Ms Manns, grabbing her throat 'quite tightly' and pulling out a clump of her hair.

At the same time, Hayden pushed Mr McCarthy in the chest.

The unemployed couple, from nearby Chandler's Ford, were eventually arrested and taken into custody.

The child was found to be soaked in urine, and did not have a blanket to keep him warm even though it was 6.30 in the evening.

Photos of clumps of Ms Manns's hair, which fell out that evening, her bleeding knuckles and marks on her back and torso were shown to the judge.

Hambrook pleaded guilty to being drunk in charge of a child in a public place and three counts of assaulting police officers, and was given a 12-week suspended sentence.

Hayden received a 12-month community order after admitting being drunk in charge of a child in a public place and assaulting a police officer.

District Judge Lorraine Morgan said: 'The extremely aggravating factor in this case is the level of your intoxication whilst you were in charge of a small child, and the potential consequences to him.

'You put him at physical risk because of your physical incapacity while in charge of him and you also exposed him to emotional harm.

'He has seen people who are drunk and people who fight and become involved in street brawls, which may have an impact on him.'

Stephen Tricker, mitigating, said the couple felt remorse for their actions, and had pledged never to drink again.

The pair must also pay £100 each to Ms Manns, £50 compensation to Mr McCarthy and £50 pounds to a custody officer who was assaulted by Hambrook.
