A police commissioner who created Britain's first youth crime tsars is set to drop the post after the role became mired in controversy.

Kent police and crime commissioner Ann Barnes chose 17-year-old Paris Brown as the UK's first youth police and crime commissioner in April 2013.

Miss Brown was forced to step down from the £15,000-a-year job just a week later after complaints about allegedly violent, racist and anti-gay comments on Twitter.

Kent's first youth crime tsar, Kerry Brown, right, was forced to resign from the role in April 2013 after several allegedly racist, violent and homophobic Tweets she made before being appointed to the post resurfaced

Ms Barnes, who was elected to the £85,000-a-year post in 2012, has been embroiled in a string of controversies, including her decision to commission a special van - dubbed Ann Force One - pictured 

But the girl that replaced her, 20-year-old Kerry Boyd, also attracted criticism.

She had to be suspended in June last year when it emerged she had a close friendship with married ex-local councillor Robert Burgess, 50.

Miss Boyd has since returned to her duties, liaising between the police and youth groups and charities.

Since her reinstatement, Miss Boyd has travelled across Kent meeting school children, youth groups and sporting organisations.  

On her documentary: 'The only reason I agreed to do the documentary was to help people better understand the role of police and crime commissioner. It is very complex and there are lots of challenges. Unfortunately I don't think the programme did that and I'm deeply sorry'. 

When asked about  her job:'Oh dear, what is a police commissioner? Right, well it's not 
the Police Commissioner, it's the Police and Crime Commissioner.

'It's
 a strange job because there is actually no description at all - there 
are certain responsibilities you have to do, but there is no actual job 
description.'

On
 what her 'Crime Onion' meant: 'Oh God, I've got no idea - I can't tell 
you actually - I wasn't thinking I'd be talking about the actual onion 
(the concentric circles) as we call it - umm I don't know know really - 
everything's important.' 

On
 her Ann Force One battle bus: 'My budget is £317million, £15,000 is 
money well spent - I could have had a top of range Mercedes, but it's 
not my image.' Mrs Barnes was then seen driving her personal Mercedes.

On resignation of Paris Brown: 'I was not recruiting an angel. I was not recruiting a police officer. I was recruiting a young person, warts and all. It is personally sad for Paris and her family'

But her 12-month contract ends on March 5 and it is thought unlikely she will be replaced. Discussions are due to take place about an exact date for Miss Boyd's departure.

There have so far been no moves to re-advertise the post publicly.

A spokesman for the commissioner's office said: 'The exact arrangements around her last day have yet to be made, but there is no replacement lined up.

'Once Kerry has left, the commissioner will decide what to do. That decision has not been taken yet.'

The post was originally set up so that the views of young people could be better represented in relation to policing in Kent.

Writing on her blog, Ms Barnes said during her year in office, Miss Boyd completed 'an excellent piece of primary research' which is due to be published shortly. 

She said: 'I have already incorporated some of Kerry’s advice into the 2015/16 refresh of my Police and Crime Plan which sets the strategic direction for Kent Police.'

Ms Barnes said the recommendations included officer and staff training around their interaction with young people. 

She also proposed that 'partners' should encourage the use of shared open spaces 'in a safe and not anti-social way'. 

Ms Barnes said her youth crime tsar also made recommendations on how to reach young people with crime prevention and safety messages.

Miss Boyd is returning to University following her time in the role.

The Crime Prosecution Service has announced that Ms Barnes will not face prosecution for driving without insurance despite finding 'she may have committed the offence'.

The IPCC launched the probe after Ms Barnes was involved in a road traffic collision on September 16, on Princes Road, Dartford. 

At the time of the crash, Ms Barnes was driving her own personal car and investigators had to decide wither the she had obstructed a police officer 'in the execution of their duty'. 

A file on the incident was sent to the CPS who had to determine whether Ms Barnes had made a 'technical breach' of her insurance conditions because the collision happened on a trip between a shop and a meeting. 

A CPS spokesperson said: 'Although some further investigation might assist in determining whether there would be sufficient evidence to prosecute this matter, we are not advising that any further inquiries take place as in any event we consider that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute.

'The alleged breach of insurance conditions is technical in nature and focuses on whether the purpose of the trip could be defined as business or personal and we consider that to be far from clear.

'In this case the insurance company did not consider that the conditions of the insurance policy were breached so as to make any claim invalid, and has indicated it will pay the claim (although in fact the other party was deemed to be liable).

'It follows that we have advised there should be no prosecution.'
