A woman was arrested in relation to the hit-and-run death of a 13-year-old Florida boy on Sunday night after she was involved in another nearby accident.

Jennifer Lee Herrington, 51, was taken into custody with the help of passers-by early Monday morning following the crash that killed Orlando teen Omar Figueroa.

Troopers say Herrington ran a red light at the intersection of North Semoran Boulevard and Old Cheney Highway about 7.30pm in Orange County.

Figueroa was walking in a crosswalk when he was struck down.

Charges pending: Jennifer Lee Herrington, 51, has been arrested over the hit-and-run death of a 13-year-old Orlando boy. Police nabbed her after she caused a second accident down the road

Tragic: Omar Figueroa, 13, is loaded into an ambulance in Orange Country on Sunday night after being hit by a car. He was pronounced dead at Arnold Palmer hospital

The impact of the hit threw him some distance, police said.

Figueroa was taken to Arnold Palmer Hospital and pronounced dead a short time later, according to Click Orlando.

Herrington then took off and fled the scene, but a witness to the crash decided to follow her so she could be held accountable.

Herrington then caused a second accident at Semoran Boulevard and Baldwin Park Street, about a mile down the road.

She suffered minor injuries in the second accident.

The witness made sure Herrington stayed at the scene and didn't try to run again before troopers arrived.

'I took her keys,' the witness said.

'I don't think she could drive the car anyway.'

Police said Herrington was acting 'abnormal' when they arrested her.

Herrington was taken to Winter Park Hospital to have blood drawn to see if she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident.

Police are still awaiting the results.

Herrington was arrested on charges of leaving the scene of a deadly crash, with further charges pending an investigation.

Her bail was set at $10,000.
