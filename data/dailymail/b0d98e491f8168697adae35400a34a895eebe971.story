A Sydney 'jihadist' has bragged about fighting on the frontline in Syria by posting a video of himself firing a machine gun out of a bombed out building in the war torn country.

The short clip of the former Bankstown local - who calls himself Ahmed Shaheed III - is believed to have been filmed by Ismail Jabbar - a Muslim extremist recently dubbed the 'British Bin Laden'.

In the video, which is accompanied by the caption 'Shooting at the Kuffar messing around with @jabz_26', laughter can be heard as he fires multiple rounds out of a sandbagged bunker.

It is understood @jabz_26 refers to Ismail Jabbar, who is being monitored by MI5 and UK police. Jabbar has been using a Twitter account with the handle @jabz_26. Elsewhere on Facebook, Shaheed refers to the radical as 'my friend'.

Fire in the hole: In a recent video, 'Ahmed Shaheed III' can be seen firing off rounds at his enemy and laughing with his mate - believed to be a man dubbed the 'British Bin Laden'

Radicalised: 'Ahmed Shaheed III' is a Sydney man waging jihad in Syria who 'admires' September 11 and boasts about having tonnes of TNT at his fingertips

The video is one of many alarming posts on the Facebook account of the former student of Bond University in Queensland.

However he is still not game to reveal his true identity by blurring his face in photos, wearing obscure masks and using the alias 'Ahmed Shaheed III', meaning 'martyr'.

Contacted by MailOnline, he claimed Ahmed Shaheed III was his real name, however Muslim leaders believe it is an alias. 

'It was either I come to Syria or ASIO takes my passport and I (hijack) a gas tanker and blow up Kings Cross,' he said.

'If you want to continue living in peace I would suggest you tell ASIO taking passports off Muslims who wanna come here is stupid and putting you Australians at risk.'

Australian government authorities have been alerted to the man's worrying social media diatribes, in which he also reveals he 'admires' the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks on America on September 11 2001.

Despite hiding behind a cloak of anonymity, 'Ahmed Shaheed III', who traveled to Syria to join a vicious civil war that has so far claimed nearly 250,000 lives, likes to keep his friends in the loop.

Dangerous path: Shaheed has seemingly become more extreme during his time on the war front and has joined up with a man dubbed the 'British Bin Laden'

In a series of sickening posts, Shaheed is providing a running commentary on the war front - backed up by vision of him laughing as he fires machine guns at his 'infidel' enemies.

Late on Sunday night he wrote to his large following back home in Australia and abroad that the war had made him truly appreciate 'how good' the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 were.

'I always admired September 11, but it was only until after i came to jihad I fully realized how good of an ameliyah istishadiah (martyrdom operation) it was,' he wrote.

Shaheed's first post - a blurred out photo of himself holding a bazooka in the Syrian desert - was made on February 22.

The content of his feed has become increasingly more alarming in the months since.

Commenting on his 'martyrdom operation' on May 23, he gloated about the massive amounts of explosives he has at his fingertips during the complex conflict waged between government and rebel forces.

'I am not doing anything less than 15 tonne TNT and 5 tonnes of shrapnel,' he wrote.

Fun and games: Alongside this photo of a devastating handheld weapon, Shaheed wrote 'say hello to my little friend'

View to a kill: In this video, a British voice can be heard telling Facebook followers to get off their computers and join the fight

Shaheed has shared a number of confronting photos of his weapons including a rocket launcher and four huge shells, alongside which he wrote 'Say hello to my little friend'.

The former Bond university student posted a bizarre video earlier this year, as revealed by MailOnline, in which he shot a round of tracers into the distance while wearing a Guy Fawkes mask.

But he appears to have become even more radicalised since.

War broke out March 2011

Overall deaths 240,000

Foreign civilian deaths 900-1900

Main government forces Syrian Armed Forces, National Defence Force, Ba'ath Brigades

Main rebel forces Islamic Front, Free Syrian Army, Syria Revolutionaries Front

In another video he is seen shooting through a tiny hole in a Syrian building while a man with a British accent speaks from behind the camera.

'We're here in Syria, while you're at home on Facebook talking about this and that, seriously need to make a move instead of keep talking,' the man can be heard saying.

'The enemy is right in front of us. We're going to be popping while you're sitting at home Facebook typing.'

It is unclear if the British man holding the camera is 22-year-old Ismail Jabbar, a London-born former shop assistant at department store House of Fraser who has also shared shocking content from the Syrian war front, including photos of beheaded victims.

Shaheed describes himself as a 'freelancer' - not tied to any specific warring group but on a sustained mission against the secular forces in the Syrian conflict.

In a post on Monday morning he wrote: 'I love the fact I never have to worry about working again, plenty of TOW missiles here for the taking'.

Next to a photo of one of his many guns he wrote: 'learned all the theory of sniping with the draganov(PSO1 scope). time to practice blasting kuffar to the next world.'

Australian Muslim leader Keysar Trad said: 'Shaheed means martyr, very likely to be an adopted title.

'His comments about September 11 fly in the face of all moderate Muslims and all the experts who have denounced this terror attack.'

In a statement to MailOnline, a spokeswoman for the Attorney-General's department reaffirmed the government's concerns about Australians joining the bloody conflict.

'The Australian Government and Australian law enforcement and intelligence agencies don’t comment on intelligence matters or confirm who they are or are not investigating,' she said.

'The Australian Government is concerned about the radicalisation of Australians as a result of the Syrian conflict, particularly those who return to Australia with the capabilities acquired through fighting or training with extremist groups.

'It is illegal under Australian law for any Australian, including dual citizens, to fight, provide funding, provide training, or supply weapons to either side of the conflict—instead, Australians can support civilians by donating funds to a legitimate UN humanitarian organisation.

'The Australian Government strongly advises Australians not to travel to Syria because of the extremely dangerous security situation, marked by ongoing military conflict, kidnappings and terrorist attacks.'

Earlier this year Australian Attorney-General George Brandis reaffirmed his commitment to stemming the tide of Australians traveling to Syria to join the fighting and reminded extremists that the federal government has the power to revoke existing passports.

'One of the most pressing issues for Australia at the moment is the problem of Syria,' he told ABC Radio.

'The Syrian civil war has become as it were a theatre for a massive escalation of activity by people who are not friends of the west. There is training going on there is facilitation.'

It is estimated that between 150 and 200 Australians have flocked to the war torn country.
