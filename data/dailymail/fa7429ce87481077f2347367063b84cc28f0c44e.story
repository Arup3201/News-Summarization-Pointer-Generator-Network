A team-mate of four footballers accused of sexually assaulting a teenager in a hotel room while she slept claimed he was shown a graphic mobile phone picture by a fellow player.

Ben Sampayo, 20, told the Old Bailey he was asleep at the time of the alleged assault by Anton Rodgers, 21, Lewis Dunk, 21, George Barker, 21, and Steve Cook, 21, on the 19-year-old.

The defendants had met the girl in a nightclub but Mr Sampayo said he could no longer remember anything about the night, when they all shared a hotel room following a cup final.

Accused: Anton Rodgers, 21, left, and Lewis Dunk, 21, right, have denied sexual assault and voyeurism

Defendants:  George Barker, 21, and Steve Cook, 21, are accused of assaulting a 19-year-old in a hotel room

Mr Sampayo, who was shown his earlier witness statement, and said he had just opened his eyes when one of the players showed him the snap on a mobile phone.

The defender said: 'A team mate came up to my bed. I don’t remember who it was. He showed me a photo. I think it was on a mobile phone. I think I saw some d**** and a hand.'

Mr Sampayo had gone back to sleep but woke again to find the girl awake. 'She seemed fine' he added.

But after being shown his statement he said she told him that 'she felt something had gone on, something about photographs.'

'She asked me 'Why did you do it?' I said 'It wasn’t anything to do with me. I was asleep. I had no part to play. Take it up with them.'

Asked by prosecutor Richard Barton, 'did you have anything to do with those photographs?', he replied: 'No.'

Mr Sampayo added: ‘She asked me why did they do it. I said I don’t know why they would have done it, you will have to speak to them.

'I said here [in the statement] she appeared a bit angry, disappointed and upset.'

Trial: Anton Rodger is accompanied to court by his father, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers

He said he and other players from Brighton and Hove Albion had gone out to celebrate after winning the Sussex Senior Cup in July 2011.

The footballer remembered a group walking back to the Jury’s Inn Hotel, Brighton, with the woman in the early hours.

Brighton players Rodgers, Dunk and Barker and former team-mate Cook, who plays for Bournemouth, deny sexual assault and voyeurism.

The prosecution says the players assaulted the drunken woman when she was asleep and took pictures as a 'record of their conquest'.

Mr Sampayo said he had been drinking and had little or no recollection.

He had been interviewed by police after being arrested with the others in January, last year.

Mr Sampayo had not been charged but five months later was summoned to the magistrates’ court and been ordered to make a statement.

Asked by Mr Barton: 'Do you want to be here today?', he replied: 'No.'

Allegation: Jury's Inn, Brighton, where the assault is alleged to have taken place following a night out

He used the statement to refer to in the witness box and his voice was barely audible. Brian O’Neill QC, for Dent, asked him to raise his voice 'as loud as if you were on the pitch'.

The court heard Mr Sampayo previously played in the Chelsea Academy team with Rodgers, who is the son of Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers.

He agreed with Rodgers’ barrister Peter Lodder QC that Rodgers 'kept himself to himself' and was the type of person who ‘joins in’ rather than leads.

Mr Sampayo said the atmosphere when they got back to the hotel after the night out at a local club was laughing and joking.'

Cross-examined by Peter Lodder QC, for Rodgers, Mr Sampayo agreed he may have been mistaken about what was said.

Mr Lodder suggested that the reference to 'hands' was to their own hands rather than someone else's hands.

The alleged victim has told the court she blacked out during the night out with the footballers and woke up to find herself lying next to Rodgers half-naked.

She then discovered around 30 photos on Rodgers' phone. One of the snaps featured Barker putting his face next to her backside and giving a thumbs-up sign, it is alleged.

The trial was adjourned to Monday.
