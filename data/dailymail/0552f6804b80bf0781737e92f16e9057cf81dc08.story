American people rank the 17th happiest population in the world - but their joyful sentiment has fallen in the last few years, according to a UN report.

U.S. citizens may be happy with this position, but according to the in-depth analysis, which takes into account individual levels of happiness plus social, economic and political measurements, overall happiness in the U.S. has fallen.

America scored a total of 7.082 out of a possible 10 across all of the UN assessments - a fall of 0.283 from last year's inaugural happiness report.

America is ranked the 17th happiest country in the world trailing the Scandinavian countries which came out on top

The UK remained fairly constant at around 6.88 both years -Â  ranking 22nd in the happiness league table this year.

Danish people are the happiest in the world and are closely followed by their Scandinavian neighbours in the latest research from the United Nations which evaluated 156 countries.

Switzerland and the Netherlands also feature high in the UN's ranking system, which has assessed freedom, corruption, generosity, social support, life expectancy, GDP per capita and other social elements in each country.

Last year the UN highlighted America as an example of a country that illustrates the 'great contradictions' that exist in humanity today.

It said: 'The U.S. has achieved striking economic and technical progress over the past half century, but with gains in self reported happiness of the citizenry,' the report states.

It went on to say the U.S. was an example of how wealth alone did not equate to happiness, pointing out the country's GNP per capita had risen by a factor of three since 1960, while measures of average happiness have remained essentially unchanged over the half-century.

Individual levels of happiness were assessed as were measurements of a country's levels of corruption, social freedoms, social support and life expectancy

There are no such statements in this year's report, perhaps in part because a greater number of variables were considered.

However, overall, the report notes that at the individual level, happiness is directly linked to good mental and physical health, someone to count on, job security and stable families.

And greater over-arching influences are also key factors in people's happiness rating, the report argues, including political freedom, strong social networks and an absence of corruption.

Drawing on these conclusions, Professor Jeffery Sachs, said: 'There is now a rising worldwide demand that policy be more closely aligned with what really matters to people as they themselves characterize their well-being,' said Professor Jeffery Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, New York, which produced the report.

'More and more world leaders are talking about the importance of well-being as a guide for their nations and the world,' he is quoted in USA Today.

He added that the report offers evidence that the systematic measurement and analysis of happiness can teach us a lot about ways to improve the world, in term's of people's well-being and countries' sustainable development.

Norway (7.655)1. Denmark (7.693)

Denmark, Norway and Switzerland each scored 7.6 out of a possible 10 in the happiness ranking measurement. The next top three were Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden.

The least happy countries are all poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (Togo, Benin, Central African Republic, Sierra Leone) with average life evaluation scores of 3.4.

It is the second annual happiness report the UN has carried out - the first was unveiled in 2012 to much media attention at the multilateral agency's high-level meeting on happiness and well-being.

Today's report shows positive feelings have improved in many countries, particularly in Latin America, and parts of Africa. But the measurement also fell in countries where there was political and economic upheaval, including Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain and Egypt.

Greece stands out from the other countries in having the largest changes in life evaluations and affect measures, 'beyond what can be explained by average responses to the economic crisis.' the report states. The country's out-of-10 happiness measurement fell from 6.326 to 5.435.

The report says: 'Research has shown that economic and other crises are more easily weathered and indeed provide the scope for cooperative actions that improve subjective well-being, if trust levels and other aspects of the social and institutional fabric are sufficiently high and well-maintained when the crisis hits.'
