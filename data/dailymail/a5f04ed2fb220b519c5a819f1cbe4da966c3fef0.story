A follower of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster claims he was discriminated against when he was told he may no longer wear a colander on his head in a driver's licence photo.

Last year, Preshalin Moodley, 20, was issued a provisional driver's licence by staff at Service NSW Parramatta, in Sydney's west.

He was photographed for the licence wearing the spaghetti strainer on his head after asking staff whether it was OK to wear a religious symbol. 

Preshalin Moodley, 20, was issued a provisional driver's licence last year while wearing a spaghetti strainer on his head, which he said is a symbol of his religion, the Church of the Flying Spaghetti monster. 'I put my colander on. She just stared at me, didn't say anything,' Mr Moodley recalled

In an apparent poke at organised religion, Pastafarians say they believe in the 'spaghetti monster' and adherents say their religion is as legitimate as any other.

Mr Moodley received a letter from Service NSW last Tuesday, March 3, and was informed he would have to have his licence reissued so a 'photograph can be retaken without any item on your head'.

'Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) have advised that this photograph does not meet the current requirements, as you were wearing a colander on your head,' the letter to Mr Moodley said. 

'The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is not a recognized (sic) religion and as such the wearing of the colander in this photograph does not meet current requirements.' 

It warned 'further action may taken' if he failed to comply.  

Mr Moodley is pictured here with a plastic colander on his head. A 'Pastafarian', the western Sydney resident has started an online petition requesting Roads Minister Duncan Gay 

Mr Moodley, a science student at the University of Western Sydney, said he was 'frustrated' and surprised by the demand and has pledged to fight the ruling.

'They don't do this to any other religion,' he said. 

His supporters have started an online petition calling for Pastafarians to be allowed to 'wear their religious headwear and observe their religion as they see fit'.  

'Even though it looks like a joke and (that) we're trying to take the mickey out of them, we're completely serious,' Mr Moodley said. 

'To an outsider who doesn't know our goals, we look like a bunch of crazy people wearing colanders, eating spaghetti, and drinking beer. 

'We're completely serious about what we're doing and I would not go this far for a practical joke. We really want Pastafarianism to be treated as equally as Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, etc. 

Mr Moodley secured media attention after managing to obtain his license with the colander on his head last year.  

'When it came to getting my photo done, I asked if religious headwear was allowed in the photo. She (the staff member) said yes. 

'I put the colander on. She just stared at me didn't say anything. I put it on and that was it.' 

This a popular artistic interpretation of the so-called 'Flying Spaghetti Monster', who is hailed as a diety in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster - which is generally seen as a light-hearted parody of religion

A Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman confirmed this letter, sent to Mr Moodley, was legitimate. 'Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster movement, known as Pastafarians, are not part of a religion recognised in NSW or other areas of Australia,' a Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman said. 'For facial recognition security reasons, colanders must therefore be removed before licence photos can be taken'

A Roads and Maritime Services spokeswoman confirmed Mr Moodley was sent the letter. 

'Religious headwear can be worn in driver licence photographs for recognised religions,' the spokeswoman said. 

'Followers of the Flying Spaghetti Monster movement, known as Pastafarians, are not part of a religion recognised in NSW or other areas of Australia.

'For facial recognition security reasons, colanders must therefore be removed before licence photos can be taken.'

Mr Moodley said: ‘If the RMS wants to terminate my licence I say go for it. I don't mind taking public transport... They can't really put me on jail or anything.’
