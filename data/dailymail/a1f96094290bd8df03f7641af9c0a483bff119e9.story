Police searching for missing toddler William Tyrell have questioned motorists who may have been driving past the house where he disappeared more than a week ago, in an increasingly desperate hunt for clues.

Officers stopped vehicles on near the house on Benaroon Drive at Kendall at about 10.30am - the time and place William was last seen.

Local police asked drivers if they had noticed any 'unusual cars' one week ago, or if they had any information that might relate to his disappearance.

Police have stopped passers-by as they investigate the disappearance of missing toddler William Tyrell last seen at his grandmother's home in Kendall 

It comes as police investigate the possibility that the missing toddler  was picked up by someone in a car when he disappeared last Friday.

He was last seen playing with his sister in his grandmother's garden on Benaroon Drive in Kendall, on the New South Wales mid-north coast, when he went missing in a five minute window while his mother and grandmother were inside the house.

Superintendent Paul Fehon said William's family were struggling with the fact that there were still no leads in relation to his whereabouts.

'Of course, being a week from when young William went missing, it's emotionally distressing for them,' he said.

'They are doing it very tough.'

The massive search shifted from bushland near his grandmother's home to a state forest nearby on Thursday

Police are trying to trace  the movements of motor vehicles which were seen in the area last Friday

About 70 volunteers, State Emergency Service crews and police will continue searching roadsides in the nearby Middle Brother State Forest for evidence as they focus on the possibility William was picked up by a car.

More than 200 volunteers and residents have scoured kilometres of bush surrounding the property in the seven days since he disappeared.

A number of tips, including reports that a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man stopped at a local shop on Friday morning to ask directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive where William was last seen, have uncovered nothing.

Forensic tests performed on a patch of blood found near a creek just over 2km from William's grandmother's house were also negative. Test results showed it was not human blood.

Bush trackers have found clues such as a knife sheath and a set of small footprints, but tip-offs from bush searches, investigations of CCTV and interviews with neighbours and local businesses have not uncovered a solid lead.

But despite the lengthy search efforts Supt Fehon said police were aiming to broaden their investigation.

'We are following every possible avenue of inquiry that is being provided to us, be it CCTV, be it information regarding persons that may have been in the area, and we're asking the public if they know of anything to provide that information to Crime Stoppers,' he said.
