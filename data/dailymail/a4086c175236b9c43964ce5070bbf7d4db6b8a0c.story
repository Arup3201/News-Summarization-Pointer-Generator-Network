Warplanes of the U.S.-led coalition have struck Islamic State fighters in Syria attacking a town near the Turkish border for the first time.

The Islamic State group's assault on the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani has sent more than 100,000 refugees streaming across the border into Turkey in recent days as Kurdish forces from Iraq and Turkey have raced to the front lines to defend the town.

Nawaf Khalil, a spokesman for Syria's Kurdish Democratic Union Party, or PYD, said the strikes targeted Islamic State positions near Kobani, also known as Ayn Arab, destroying two tanks. He said the jihadi fighters later shelled the town, wounding a number of civilians.

The United States, France and five Arab allies launched an aerial campaign against Islamic State fighters in Syria early on Tuesday with the aim of rolling back and ultimately crushing the extremist group, which has created a state spanning the Syria-Iraq border.

Along the way, the militants have massacred captured Syrian and Iraqi troops, terrorised minorities in both countries and beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker.

Labour's decision to oppose military strikes against the Syrian regime last year - leading Mr Cameron to abandon the proposal after suffering defeat in the Commons - had 'emboldened' the West's enemies, Commons leader William Hague said.

It had 'not helped perceptions of the west being ready to defend itself', he added.

Meanwhile The Sunday Mirror has reported that MI6 has been in talks with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad’s regime over attacking ISIS fighters in Syria.

Spy chiefs have reportedly been negotiating with senior foreign office diplomats in the Syrian capital Damascus.

Both Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and David Cameron have insisted that Britain will not strike deals with the Assad, whose regime is fighting ISIS.

A source told the paper: 'It may be there are no face-to-face meetings with Assad himself but behind the double-speak of foreign relations it is perfectly normal for them to see his senior people. It would be staggering if Britain’s intelligence agencies were not talking to Assad’s people.

'The talks they have within Syria are of invaluable benefit to Britain’s security.'

The latest air strikes came as Syria's foreign minister Walid al-Moallem told the Lebanon-based Al-Mayadeen TV that air strikes alone 'will not be able to wipe out' the Islamic State group.

Speaking from New York where he is attending the UN General Assembly, Mr al-Moallem said that the U.S. should work with Damascus if it wants to win the war.

'They must know the importance of coordination with the people of this country because they know what goes on there,' Mr al-Moallem said.

The U.S. has ruled out any coordination with President Bashar Assad's government, which is at war with the Islamic State group as well as Western-backed rebels.

The former head of the UK military raised questions the effectiveness of isolated air attacks against ISIS militants.

Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, a former head of the UK military who stepped down as chief of the defence staff last year, told the Sunday Times that the terror group would not be defeated by air attacks alone and that a conventional campaign involving ground troops would be needed to crush them.

Lord Richards said: 'Ultimately you need a land army to achieve the objectives we've set ourselves - all air will do is destroy elements of IS, it won't achieve our strategic goal.

'The only way to defeat IS is to take back land they are occupying which means a conventional military operation. The only way to do it effectively is to use western armies, but I understand the political resistance.'

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the coalition's strikes near Kobani came amid heavy fighting between the Islamic State group and members of the Kurdish force known as the People's Protection Units, or YPK.

The Britain-based group, which relies on activists inside Syria, had no immediate word on casualties from the strikes. The Observatory reported yesterday that 13 civilians have been killed by the strikes since they began.

Kurdish fighter Majid Goran told the Associated Press by telephone from Kobani that two bombs were dropped over the nearby village of Ali Shar but that the positions they struck were empty.

Turkey's Dogan news agency reported that the sound of heavy fighting could be heard from the Turkish border village of Karaca. The agency said Kurdish forces retook some positions they had lost to the Islamic militants a few days ago.

Dozens of people wounded in the fighting arrived in Turkey for treatment, it said.

Another Kurdish fighter, Ismet Sheikh Hasan, said the Turkish military retaliated after stray shells landed on Turkish territory, firing in the Ali Shar region. He said the Turkish action left Kurdish fighters in the middle of the crossfire.

He said that yesterday the Islamic militants were attacking the Kobani area from the east with tanks and artillery, advancing on Ali Shar and Haja. He said some 20 people were killed, including Kurdish fighters and civilians, while another 50 people were wounded.

The fighting around Kobani sparked one of the largest single outflows of refugees since Syria's conflict began more than three years ago.

The Syrian Kurdish forces have long been one of the most effective fighting units battling the Islamic State, but the tide has turned in recent weeks as the Islamic militants have attacked with heavy weapons likely looted from neighbouring Iraq.

The Observatory said other coalition air strikes targeted Islamic State compounds in the central province of Homs and the northern regions of Raqqa and Aleppo. The group said 31 explosions were heard in the city of Raqqa, the group's de facto capital, and its suburbs.

The Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, said the strikes in the east hit the province of Deir el-Zour as well as Raqqa. The LCC also said the coalition targeted grain silos west of Deir el-Zour city.

Max Blumenfeld, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said the U.S. air strikes 'don't target food or anything else than can be used by the civilian population'.

But he said that until the military reviews images from planes that participated in the strikes, he could not rule out that silos were hit.

He said the air strikes are aimed at specific Islamic State targets such as command and control centres, transportation and logistics, and oil refineries, 'but not food that could have an impact upon the civilian population'.

'Our targets are structures that combatants would use,' he said.

Mr Blumenfeld later said the U.S. did target what he called an Islamic State grain storage facility on Tuesday near Boukamal, a town close to the Iraqi border which was seized by the Islamic State group earlier this year.

Sniper HQ of Al-Qaeda group flattened by Coalition airstrikes

The headquarters of the deadly snipers of the Al-Nusra Front was reportedly destroyed by Coalition airstrikes over the weekend.

The building, in a residential area of Al-Muhandisin district of Aleppo, Syria, was flattened by a bomb. A number of other buildings were also hit, and rescuers were pictured attempting to dig out people trapped under rubble following the carnage.

The Al-Nusra Front is Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria and has long been one of the most effective forces fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

However it was weakened this year by battles with Islamic State. The two share the same ideology and rigid Islamic beliefs, but fell out during a power struggle that pitted Islamic State head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi against al Qaeda chief Ayman Zawahri and Nusra Front leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani.

But U.S.-led air and missile strikes, which have hit Nusra as well as Islamic State bases in Syria, have angered many members who say the West and its allies have joined forces in a 'crusader' campaign against Islam - so IS and Al-Nusra should do the same.
