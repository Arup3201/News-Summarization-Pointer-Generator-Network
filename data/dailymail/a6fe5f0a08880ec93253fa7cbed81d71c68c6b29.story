Ruby Walsh has hit back at the individuals who sent him death threats during the Cheltenham Festival and rasied concerns for his children.

Walsh, who broke his arm after a heavy fall in the opening race of the final day, created controversy when he said that animals are replaceable after Our Conor suffered a fatal fall on Tuesday.

The 34-year-old insisted that his comments had been misunderstood but nonetheless stood by his comments.

'It’s spineless people that tweet, I’m 35 so I can ignore it,' he told the Irish Independent.

'But
 I would worry for my kids that people could tweet them. Bullying on 
Twitter is a serious problem. There is no place for bullies.

'I
 don’t apologise for what I said and stand over it,' he insisted. 
'Horses are animals and you keep them out your back door, you don’t keep
 your family out your back door. You can replace a horse. You can’t 
replace a human being. That’s my feeling on it.

'There’s
 a big difference between you going home tonight and something’s 
happened to your dog, and you go home tonight and something’s happened 
to one of your kids. There’s a huge difference.'

Following his initial comments animal rights campaigners accused the 34-year-old Irishman of being callous, while others bombarded him with threats.

One tweeted: ‘Ruby Walsh I hope you get your skull crushed by one of the horses you’re so heartlessly flippant about. Animals should not die for sport.’

Another added: ‘Shame more jockeys aren’t killed instead of beautiful horses!!!!!! All jockeys are complete c**ts!! No horse is replaceable!’

While another wrote: ‘@Ruby Walsh Don’t worry if you die in a race, there’ll be someone to replace you too.’

Dene Stansall of campaign group Animal Aid told the Mail: ‘He has shown callousness for the animals that have earned him a good living.

‘It’s completely disrespectful. To treat the death of a horse in such a way shows that they are merely machines for people to make money.

‘Ruby Walsh is the leading jockey at Cheltenham and wants to support the event as much as he can, but you cannot disregard the lives of horses just because they are not humans.

‘We would expect more from him. This shows he has got little empathy for a horse that really suffered before it died.’

Ingrid Newkirk, founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), said: ‘Walsh’s comments expose the true emotion behind horseracing: greed. They are deeply offensive to anyone who has ever loved and lost a horse or other beloved animal companion.

‘Unlike Walsh, horses are not unfeeling but experience joy, anxiety, fear and affection, just as human beings do.’

One user, with the profile name Amy, wrote: ‘Do you hate horses because you are so short and this makes you angry?’

Another posted: ‘YOUR (sic) AN IDIOT!! ‘A horse can be replaced’ really??? So can jockeys so I hope you fall off a horse & get trampled!’

Since the furore, Mr Walsh’s father, trainer Ted Walsh, has compared Britain’s attitude on the issue to that in Ireland.

He said of the UK: ‘It’s a funny country. They can remember the names of horses that got blown up by the bombs in London but not the names of the people riding them.’

The British Horseracing Association went on to stress that the welfare of horses is ‘paramount’ at races such as Cheltenham.

A spokesman said: ‘Cheltenham Racecourse employs eight veterinary surgeons, whose sole responsibility it is to provide care to the horses throughout their time at the racecourse.

‘In the event of an incident on the racecourse, any horse affected will receive immediate attention and treatment from the racecourse’s veterinary team.

‘Qualified paramedics and doctors are also on hand in the case of any incident involving a jockey.

‘If necessary, horses and riders will be transported from the course to receive further treatment at the most appropriate equine hospital or Accident & Emergency hospital.

‘British Racing is open and transparent about the risks involved in the sport - the BHA Veterinary team monitors injury rates at every licensed racecourse. Over the last 15 years, the equine fatality rate has fallen by one third to 0.2 per cent of all runners.

‘Despite the best efforts of all involved, as with participation in any sport involving speed and athleticism, there remains an inherent risk of injury.’
