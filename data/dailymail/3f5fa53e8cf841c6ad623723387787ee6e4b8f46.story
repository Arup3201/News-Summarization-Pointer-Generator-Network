The Irish word for film, scannán, seems innocuous enough to Gaeilgeoirs.

But a group of YouTube users has been using it as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material.

The issue was highlighted after an Irish media student searched for 'scannán' and the plural 'scannáin' only to find pornographic footage featuring Asian women.

The Irish word for film, scannán, seems innocuous enough to Gaeilgeoirs. But a group of YouTube users has been using it as a secret phrase to hide pornography on the site and circumvent a ban on explicit material

The films, disguised using various Irish language titles, were uploaded by four different accounts which were all registered in October.

Connemara-based Maitíú Ó Coimín, a journalist with the Irish language website Tuairisc, first reported the issue after his flatmate found the material.

'My flatmate is a media student in Galway who was looking up [the Irish word for film] on YouTube for a project,' Mr Coimín told the BBC.

Watching porn on laptops replaced the magazine, and now it seems mobiles are set to replace viewing adult sites on desktops.

Last year, the number of people accessing porn on smartphones rose by 12 per cent.

Android users, in particular, viewed the most pornographic videos last year, accounting for almost half of mobile users - an increase of 11 per cent.

The figures come from Pornhub Insight’s 2014 Year in Review report. The site saw 78.9 billion video views over the past 12 months, up from 63.2 billion in 2013.

Phones equated for 45 per cent of these views, the desktop was on 44 per cent, with tablets on 11 per cent. This is a 20 per cent increase for tablets. 

'I looked a bit further into it, and there were about 15 to 20 films of a questionable nature.'

Mr Coimín added that the accounts were probably not owned by Irish speakers – or Gaeilgeoirs - as the phrasing in the description suggests an online translation tool was used.

Instead, the four channel appear to originate from Russia, Italy, the U.S. and Japan.

Mr Ó Coimín believes many other languages are being used like this to get around YouTube's policies.

'Our team was quick to take action,' a YouTube spokesperson said.

'YouTube's community guidelines clearly state that sexually explicit content is not allowed on our site.

'We remove videos and channels that violate our policies when flagged for our attention.

'YouTube staff review flagged videos 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to determine whether they violate our community guidelines.'
