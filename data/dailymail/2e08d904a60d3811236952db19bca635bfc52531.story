Enraged: Neil Dugdale allegedly went round to Adam French's house with a cliff hammer, threatening to kill him, after he stopped playing online games with him

A computer games fan is facing jail for threatening to 'slit the throat' of his friend who  stopped playing Grand Theft Auto with him.

Neil Dugdale, 31, became angry after Adam French, 22, left a gaming session without telling him.

So he stormed over to his house in Felixstowe, Suffolk, clutching a knife and claw-hammer, and threatened to 'slit his throat'.

The pair used to regularly play multiplayer via the internet on the violent gangster game as they sat in their own homes a few doors apart.

Ipswich Magistrates' Court heard how jobless Dugdale sent Mr French a message through their on-line game connection, saying he was going to slit his throat.

Dugdale, who had taken a cocktail of cider, cannabis and anti-depressants, then stormed round to Mr French’s home with a kitchen knife and a claw hammer.

Prosecutor Lesla Small said Dugdale shouted: 'I’m going to slit your throat - I’m going to f*****g kill you.'

Mr French swore at Dugdale from a window and told him to go away from his home in Felixstowe, Suffolk.

Dugdale was seen stabbing the blade of the knife in the top of a garden fence while shouting at Mr French to come down, said Ms Small.

When Mr French’s sister came out, Dugdale smashed the front passenger window of her Renault Clio and raised the hammer above his head.

She retreated back in the house and Dugdale returned to his own home at around 5.30pm last Friday.

Dugdale, who had cut himself while waving around the knife, was later seen by his mother washing blood from his hand in her kitchen sink.

The court heard how she noticed he was angry and saw the hammer on the floor next to the knife.

Cut off: The pair frequently played Grand Theft Auto, but Dugdale was angry after Mr French stopped playing

Police were called and found Dugdale walking down the centre of the road outside his home, carrying the knife and hammer in an aggressive manner.

Ms Small said officers who approached heard him swearing about someone and asking for help.

Dugdale leaned on their patrol car as they got out and began flailing his arms, she added.

He then calmed down before he flared up again and started struggling and swearing, threatening the officers by saying he would headbutt them.

Ms Small said: 'Grand Theft Auto is quite a violent game in nature. It’s like a virtual city. There’s gang violence, street fighting and stealing cars.'

Dugdale who plays games on his 51inch TV admitted two counts of possessing an offensive weapon, criminal damage, affray and resisting arrest.

Neighbours: The pair lived a few doors away from each other near a junction between Graham Road and Seaton Road in Felixstowe, Suffolk

He was remanded in custody by magistrates and told his case was so serious that he would be sent to Ipswich Crown Court for sentencing.

Dugdale swore loudly as he was taken to the cells after his application for bail was refused.

Mark Holt, defending, said Dugdale did not accept that he and Mr French had fallen out while playing Grand Theft Auto.

Dugdale claimed he had become angry because he had twice confided in Mr French only for his confidences to be betrayed.

Condemned: The game has been repeatedly criticised for allegedly encouraging violent behaviour and has been blamed for four murders in the United States and Thailand

Mr Holt said he had no doubt it had been 'frightening for those who witnessed the incident, but in reality it was all words and bluster'.

Grand Theft Auto involves players earning points for carrying out a series of assaults, carjackings and murders including drive-by shootings.

The game has been repeatedly criticised for allegedly encouraging violent behaviour and has been blamed for four murders in the United States and Thailand.
