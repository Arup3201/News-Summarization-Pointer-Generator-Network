iPads and laptops in the bedroom have had a cooling effect on the sex lives of British public after it was revealed we're now making love less than ever.

A new study into the bedroom habits of average Brit has found that people today have sex only three times every four weeks, a marked decrease from figures in 2001 which showed the average adult was having sex once a week. 

And the blame for that fall in under-the-covers activity has been placed on 'distractions' such as computers, iPads and mobile phones.

Prof Kaye Wellings of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the study leaders, said Brits could be 'blurring of the line in the home between the bedroom and outside'

The figures have been taken from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles, or Natsal, which is conducted every ten years.

They indicate there has been a steady decline in British bedroom activity this decade.

The results however did show a wide variation among the population with the latest figures suggesting that in 2012 a quarter of the people had sex more than seven times in four weeks, while the same number saw no action at all.

Experts believe, as well as the temptation to spend time with our computers rather than our partners, work commitments and the tendency for couples to live apart could have also have affected numbers.

Prof Kaye Wellings of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of the study leaders, said the change could be in part down to the 'blurring of the line in the home between the bedroom and outside'

Dr Cath Mercer from University College London said: 'It is interesting from our data to observe a decline in sexual frequency even among those who are living together or are married to their sexual partner.' (picture posed by models)

She said: People taking laptops to bed, iPads, the fact work comes into our home now – there's no strict divide'

Dr Cath Mercer, another of the researchers from University College London, added: 'We need to take account of the fact that fewer people are living with their sexual partners nowadays so fewer people are having the opportunity to have sex.

'However it is interesting from our data to observe a decline in sexual frequency even among those who are living [together] or are married to their sexual partner.'
