As revealed by Sportsmail's Matt Lawton, Malky Mackay and Iain Moody have been reported to the FA and accused of being racist, sexist and homophobic in a shocking series of text messages dating back to their time together at Cardiff City. 

Here, we take a look at the three main players in the saga.

IAIN MOODY

As a graduate in French and Italian, Moody initially found work as a translator for the Italy side during Euro 96, before taking a staff writer’s position at Football365.com.

In 2001, he made the move to Athole Still International, a London-based sports management franchise, then leaving to become Watford’s press officer four years later.

It was at Vicarage Road that Moody first linked up with Malky Mackay, forming a close professional relationship that saw him soon promoted to football operations manager.

When Mackay left for Cardiff in 2011, Moody followed, this time as head of recruitment. Cardiff reached the League Cup final in 2012 and were promoted to the Premier League a year later, but amid a protracted bust-up between Mackay and the club’s controversial owner, Vincent Tan, Moody was dismissed in October 2013.

He was replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, who was at the club on work experience and a friend of Tan’s son.

Crystal Palace were quick to appoint Moody as their sporting director, with a remit to improve their club infrastructure and to address weaknesses in player recruitment. 

MALKY MACKAY

A powerful centre-back with Queen’s Park, Celtic, Norwich, West Ham and Watford — winning five Scotland caps — he began his managerial career at Championship club Watford in 2009, after Brendan Rodgers resigned. He spent two years at Vicarage Road, safeguarding them from relegation, before moving to Cardiff in 2011.

In his first season in charge of the Welsh club, Mackay, 42, guided them to their first ever League Cup final, which they lost to Liverpool on penalties and finished sixth in the Championship, though they missed out on promotion through the play-offs.

Still, 2012’s heartache proved to be short-lived, as Cardiff were promoted to the Premier League as champions the following year. Despite his successes, however, Mackay’s relationship with club owner Vincent Tan became increasingly strained.

The Malaysian businessman was reportedly dissatisfied with Mackay’s transfer dealings. Mackay was dismissed as Cardiff manager in December 2013.

VINCENT TAN

The bank clerk who became an insurance salesman. The insurance salesman who bought a McDonald’s chain. The McDonald’s store owner who built an empire. The story of Vincent Tan, 62, is fittingly colourful.

He bought a McDonald’s franchise in 1980, using the money from rapid expansion to purchase Sports Toto in 1985, a gambling company. Unprecedented success on both fronts allowed him to venture into several more industries, most notably founding the Berjaya Group, which runs the gamut over Malaysian property development and holidays. In addition, he owns two football clubs, Cardiff City, relegated last season, and FK Sarajevo in Bosnia.

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
