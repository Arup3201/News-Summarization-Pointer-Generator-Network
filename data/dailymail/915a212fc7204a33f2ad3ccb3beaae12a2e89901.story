Rohit Sharma scored the highest ever individual score in a one-day international and became the first player to score two career double centuries in a 50-over match with 264 against Sri Lanka. 

The sensational innings on a batsman-friendly Kolkata  came off 173 balls with 33 fours and nine sixes, and only ended on the last ball of India's innings as Sharma holed out in the deep.

Sharma said he was 'ready to bat another 50 overs' after walking off the Eden Gardens with his side on a formidable 404 for five after winning the toss and batting first. His score alone would have won the match by 13 runs after the visitors were all out in the 44th over for 251.

India's Rohit Sharma hit 264 from 173 balls against Sri Lanka for the highest ever ODI score on Thursday

Sri Lanka were made to pay for dropping the destructive 27-year-old in the fifth over with his tally just four runs at the time.  

Sharma's innings demolishes Virender Sehwag's previous record of a 149-ball 219 against the West Indies in 2011. Sharma also has the third top score in ODIs with his 209 off 158 balls against Australia in November last year.

Sharma's knock got off to a modest start with the opener reaching his hundred in even time, with his first 50 off 72 balls and his second 50 in a swift 28 deliveries.

From then it was a procession for the right-hander. His third 50 took 25 balls and the 50 up to his 200 took just 26 deliveries. With the end in sight, and Sharma looking to cash in knowing 350 is an achievable target at this ground, he reached 250 in a further 15 balls.

2) VIRENDER SEHWAG (India) 219 (149 ball) v West Indies, December 8, 2011

10) GARY KIRSTEN (South Africa) 188* (159 balls) v UAE February 16, 1996

'Once I got to 50 I knew I had to make a century because it was a good batting wicket and we knew 350 was easily chaseable. That made me stay there as long as possible,' Sharma said on Sky Sports 2. 

'It is important to look at the team score as that is how you build an innings.' 

Had opening bowler Nuwan Kulasekara been given his full allocation of 10 overs he could have made a century of his own after going for 89 runs off nine overs at a rate of 9.88. 

His only consolation was that it was off his bowling that Sharma's wicket fell, with the rampant 27-year-old finding the safe hands of Mahela Jayawardene instead of the middle of his bat.

Coming into this match, Sharma had scored 142 for an India A side ina  warm-up against the Sri Lankans - his last knock before that was in August against England in Cardiff where he injured his hand.

Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar are the only other players to have reached 200 in an ODI.

One record Sharma fell short of was for the highest score for a limited-overs match, falling a single shot along the ground short of Alistair Brown's 268 for Surrey in 2002.

India got off to the perfect start with the ball, removing Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera without scoring with the third ball of their first over.

Despite a mid-innings fightback from Angelo Mathews (75) and Lahiru Thiramine (59) the target proved a task too great and India took a 4-0 series lead with one match remaining.
