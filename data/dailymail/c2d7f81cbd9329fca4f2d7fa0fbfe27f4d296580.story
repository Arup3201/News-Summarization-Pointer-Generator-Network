Doctors originally diagnosed him with hepatitis A, mono and the Norovirus after he felt sick in at an event January 2013, he told UrbanDaily in April.

Mr Givens said that he hadn't felt fully better since, with his condition worsening after he fell in January.

The star, who first became known on I Love New York in 2007, said that he checked himself into the hospital in March 2013 after a medicine from the last doctor he saw made him lose thirty pounds from diarrhea.

He said the doctor came in crying and I knew something was seriously wrong.

Mr Givens's cancer eventually spread to his brain, and he had a procedure (pictured) to remove nerve damage caused by the disease 

He posted this picture of his surgery scar two months ago and said that he was choosing between clinical trials after his chemotherapy stopped working

'She said, “I have bad news to tell you. You have cancer. You have stage four colon cancer.”' 

Another doctor told him that he likely had two weeks left to live. 

Mr Givens had an operation to remove cancerous growths from his colon in December 2013. 

While in surgery, doctors removed most of his liver after they found that the cancer had spread and created seven tumors. 

He later found out that the tumors had also spread to his brain and he was partially paralyzed on his right side. 

Two months ago he posted on Instagram that he was being taken off of chemotherapy because 'none of it works anymore'. 

He said that he was choosing between different clinical trials to try new medicines.
