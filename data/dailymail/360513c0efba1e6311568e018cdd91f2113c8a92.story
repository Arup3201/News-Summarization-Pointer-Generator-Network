A Maine couple may face charges after recording a very close encounter with a bull moose while snowmobiling last week.

Janis and Bob Powell posted the two-and-a-half minute video to YouTube last Friday which shows the couple, on two separate snowmobiles, chasing a bull moose along a trail in Jackman before the animal stops and confronts them.

The footage incurred the wrath of wildlife lovers and the couple is now being investigated by the Maine Warden Service.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The chase: Bob Powell is recorded by his wife Janis as the pair follow a bull moose along a Maine trail

Confrontation: The moose, tiring of the chase, stops and turns to confront Bob Powell

Man versus moose: Bob Powell got off his snowmobile, using it to put some distance between himself and the riled-up moose

Filmed by Janis Powell, the encounter 
shows the moose charging at a fleeing Bob Powell, with Janis Powell 
eventually firing a handgun to scare the animal off.

The video was posted to YouTube five days ago and has since garnered 146,000 views - and a lot of opinions.

Janis Powell reposted the video on Saturday, but tellingly removed the first 18 seconds, which shows the couple chasing the moose on their loud and fast snowmobiles. This action aroused even more heated criticism.

The comments have now been disabled on the video, after the couple received what Janis Powell describes as harassing messages.

'People have started to comment that weâ€™re trying to hide things on purpose,' she told the Bangor Daily News on Sunday.

Charge: Bob Powell's attempts to shoo away the moose were unsuccessful

Contact: The moose cuffed Powell as his wife Janis recorded the incident with growing fear

Undeterred: Bob Powell climbs onto his wife's snowmobile to try and get away from the moose, which shows no sign of departing

'Thatâ€™s not true; we have nothing to hide. I edited this video earlier because it was clear that a lot of people have no idea at all what they are watching, were completely misinterpreting it, and were very rude to us as a result.'

She reposted the original video Saturday evening and says she and her husband reported the incident to the Maine Warden Service immediately after it happened.

Corporal John MacDonald said the wardens have seen the video and that the investigation may take up to two weeks.

'We are seeing what everyone else can see on that video,' MacDonald told the Bangor Daily News. 'We need to take a closer look at it and see if [the Powells] did anything illegal or unreasonable.'If charged and convicted, MacDonald said, the Powells could be facing a fine, the amount of which would be determined by the district attorney and the courts.

Shots fired: Janis Powell finally fires off her handgun to scare the beast away, though the creature seems unconcerned by the blast

Backing off: Eventually, the moose turns heel and trots away from the fearful snowmobilers

Relief: Bob Powell finally turns to face his wife after his close encounter with the moose

Mark Latti, spokesman for Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, said anyone encountering a moose should keep their distance and allow the animal to go about its business in peace.

'Seeing a moose on a snowmobile trail is not all that unusual,' Latti told the Bangor Daily News.

'People need to stop and let the moose go on its way. It may take a few minutes but that is a better alternative than stressing the moose out by getting too close.

'Itâ€™s been a long, hard winter for a lot of wildlife, including the moose. People need to slow down and let them disperse naturally.'

Janis Powell says she and her husband had no intention of stressing the moose.

'We have nothing but the utmost respect for wildlife, and would never do anything to harm these wonderful creatures,' she said, adding that the Powells will 'certainly be giving moose some more space in the future.'
