Aberdeen and Groningen fans were involved in violent clashes on the streets before their Europa League clash on Thursday night.

In several shocking videos posted online, fans are seen lining up on opposite sides of the street as police struggle to stem the tide. Elsewhere, smoke bombs were let off which appear to spook the police horses.

Aberdeen went on to shock their hosts 2-1 to reach the third qualifying round where they will meet Real Sociedad.

Aberdeen knew that an away goal would be crucial following a goalless Pittodrie clash and they got it 26 minutes into the second leg of the second qualifying round when Rooney converted a penalty.

McGinn followed up after Rooney hit the bar seven minutes later and Aberdeen looked like strolling through.

But Maikel Kieftenbeld pulled one back just before the break and Aberdeen had to ride out some uncomfortable periods in the second half.

But a defence supplemented with Andrew Considine, who started in place of Barry Robson, held firm to the delight of their travelling fans.
