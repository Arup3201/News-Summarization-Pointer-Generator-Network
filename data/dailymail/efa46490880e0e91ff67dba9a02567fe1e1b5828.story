Dr Michael Dixon said that hospitals would be forced to slim down considerably

Hospitals will have to shrink or close altogether in the wake of new reforms that have given GPs control of more than two-thirds of the health service’s annual budget.

Dr Michael Dixon, who represents many of the clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) that last week took control of £65bn of health spending, said that hospitals would be forced to slim down considerably as more services are moved out to the community. 

Under the new reforms, every GP’s practice in England is affiliated to one of 211 commissioning groups, whose boards of GPs, nurses, hospital doctors and lay members will decide how to spend the local health budget.

The reforms -- which replace the old local Primary Care Trusts – are intended to cut bureaucracy, reduce costs and foster competition, encouraging private firms and charities to take on health service contracts.

Dr Dixon told The Guardian that diagnostic tests, outpatient appointments and much of care for the elderly should be moved to local clinics to improve services to patients and save money.

His vision is that rather than being one of first port of calls for medical treatment, hospitals would need to downsize and become centres of excellence for specialist, and/or intensive care.

Patients needing more general care could be looked after in the community.

Care of elderly patients, in particular, could radically change under the reforms. Older people account for around 70 per cent of hospital bed occupancy, but could in the future be cared for at home by teams of community-based health professionals, Dr Dixon said.

Dr Dixon, interim president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, said believes that at least believes that half of hospitals’ current workloads ‘could or should be done elsewhere’.

He added that there was an ‘an awful lot of fat’ in the NHS budget and the health service needed to become more patient-friendly.

When asked by the newspaper whether 
the reforms would mean hospitals had to slim down, close or both, Dr 
Dixon said both would be options. 

The issue of GPs holding the purse 
strings could also damage relationships with patients, he conceded, 
given how vehemently opposed local hospital closures are opposed by 
residents.

New reforms introduced last week mean that GPs have responsibility for more than two-thirds of the health service's annual budget

He said that CCGs were ‘up’ for pushing through the reforms needed – while managing the demands of the elderly population on the NHS – would need ‘considerable protection and support’ to implement necessary changes.

The BMA has said that changes to the services offered by hospitals should be a gradual process and based on clinical evidence rather than cost-cutting.

Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said the ageing population meant hospitals had to change how they operated, the aim being to keep people living independently out of hospitals for longer.

He said: ‘This is a difficult journey but it's one the NHS has to make. A good analogy is that until the 1980s people with mental illness and learning disabilities were looked after in hospitals and then there was a big shift of care into the community. That was controversial at the time but is now, years later, recognised as having been the right thing.’;

He added that a large proportion of hospital staff would have to start working in non-hospital settings to make the new forms of care work for

A report last year for the Royal College Of Physicians found that many hospital buildings, services and staff are not equipped to deal with the increasing number of older people being admitted to hospital with multiple, complex needs, including dementia.
