Half the white line markings on major roads need replacing because of ‘shameful’ neglect that is putting lives at risk, a new report concludes today.

The poll found that 52 per cent of markings on motorways, 42per cent on dual carriageways and 48 per cent on single carriageways in England needed a new lick of paint immediately.

The survey of 4,300 miles of road across the UK – including 2,500 in England – exposes similar problems in Scotland and Wales.

Potentially lethal: The M3 is in dire need of a paint job with 94% of its white markings between Bagshot and Camberley needing work (file picture)

The section of road which scored the lowest rating, with 94 per cent of markings in need of replacing or being scheduled for replacement, was a stretch of the M3 between Bagshot and Camberley in Surrey.

Just one in six (16 per cent) of markings on motorways in England and one in 8 (13 per cent) of the markings on single carriageways were considered to fall into the ‘excellent’ category, according to the survey of 2,500 miles of roads by the Road Safety Markings Association (RSMA).

RSMA national director George Lee said: ‘It is shameful that half of the markings on roads are so worn out that they need to be replaced.’

Details are revealed in a new ‘LifeLines report published on the road safety website comparethemarkings.com

The report says repainting road markings on major A roads, could cut road deaths by up to a third.

In Scotland some 43 per cent of markings need immediate replacement or need to be scheduled for replacement. The standard of markings is ‘of significant concern’ and in places ‘inadequate,’ says the report.

In Wales 63per cent of markings on motorways and 48 per cent on dual-carriageways need replacing immediately or need to be scheduled for replacement. Only 1 in 100 (1per cent) make the ‘excellent’ grade.

Mr Lee said: ‘Despite continuing to give assurances of their commitment to road safety, those responsible for the upkeep of our roads continue to neglect the most cost-effective safety device available to road engineers, the white line.

‘It is shameful that half of the markings on roads in England are so worn out that they need to be replaced. These markings have already been paid for because we, as taxpayers, are paying to have the roads maintained properly, including the markings, and this is just not happening. The robust evidence in our survey and in this report proves this to be the case.’

Mr Lee said: ‘The humble white line can save lives and it is therefore important that they are maintained to a sufficient standard that they do their job properly.  If a line is so worn that it cannot be seen, it may as well not be there.’

He added: ‘If I went to the supermarket, bought a bag of apples, got them home and found that half of them were rotten, I am sure that every right-thinking person would agree that I should get my money back.

‘With that in mind, what should our reaction be when we discover that half of road markings across all type of roads, whilst not rotten, are such a state that they are in need of immediate replacement or should be scheduled now for replacement?’
