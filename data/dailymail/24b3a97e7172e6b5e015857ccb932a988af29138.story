An amateur player from the fourth tier of Austrian football has been handed a massive 70 game ban - after hospitalising a referee with a headbutt.

Ismail Gunduz was playing for SK Rum when, incensed at being shown a second yellow card in the 86th minute, he headbutted the referee.

The official had to go to hospital with blood flowing from his lip, and Gunduz was swiftly sacked by his club and handed the lengthy ban by the Tirol Football Association.

Immediate: SK Rum, whose ground is pictured, got rid of Gunduz 'with immediate effect'

His former manager, Michael Messner, indicated the club's displeasure with their now ex-player. 'We distance ourselves from Ismail Gunduz's behaviour. He was thrown out of the club with immediate effect.'

However, the player himself labelled the ban 'madness', and in a defence similar to Barcelona striker Luis Suarez, claims he merely slipped.

'This sentence is madness,' said Gunduz, citing a misunderstanding. 'I will do all I can to return to the pitch.'

But a spokesman for the Tirol FA, who handed out the punishment, said it was justified.

'The 70-match suspension is without precedent as far as we know, but it seemed proportionate to us given the gravity of the offence,' said Horst Scherl.
