The Leon County Sheriff's Office said Porter and her toddler, who were identified today, lived in the Whispering Woods Apartment Complex.

Preliminary autopsy results indicate both died from a single gunshot wound to the head.

She was a single mother, McQuaig said, with investigators immediately unable to identify or contact the father of her child.

walked around because the back end of the golf course here and then I 
saw the deceased and it just stopped me in my place,' Ray Parsons said, 
according to CBS News.

Parson said the tragic shooting was out-of-place in the quiet neighborhood.

'It made me feel sad because she is lying on the ground and there's nothing she could do for herself ... and that's kind of shocking,' he said.

Another neighbor, Randria Walker, who has lived in the apartment complex for four months, said she was asleep when the shooting occurred.

She added the horrific incident has prompted her to already consider moving.

'I was in shock because it's so quiet out here,' she said.
