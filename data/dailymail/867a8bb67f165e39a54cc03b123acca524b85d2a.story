Ronald Noble, Interpol secretary general, has warned that weak passport security could help terrorists

The failure of many European countries to check passports against an international database of lost and stolen travel documents could ‘lead to another September 11’, according to the head of Interpol.

Secretary General Ronald Noble, a former head of the US Secret Service, said the security gap could allow potential terrorists to enter Europe and cross multiple borders undetected.

He said: ‘So many basic steps aren’t being taken, which could lead to another September 11, another July 7, another March 7 in Madrid.

‘The lesson that should have been learned...is that people carrying stolen travel documents, if they are not stopped, can enter your country and mastermind a horrible attack.’

He added that last year 500 million flights were not screened against the Interpol database.

‘Right now, there are less countries than fingers on my hand in the EU that are systematically screening the passports of people coming across their borders through Interpol’s database,’ he said.

Mr Noble said the Schengen Agreement, which allows people to travel across much of the EU without a passport, meant a single weakness in border security could put the whole of the European mainland at risk.

A European commission source told the Independent that the Schengen area had its own security database, so member states were not obliged to carry out checks with Interpol.

But Interpol warns that the Schengen area's security system is not as comprehensive, since it excludes records from 131 other countries that contribute to Interpol's records.

Stringent: The UK Border Agency make more Interpol checks than the rest of Europe combined

Britain is the only EU country to systematically check passports against those registered with Interpol as missing worldwide.

Last year more than 11,000 people were caught trying to enter the UK using lost or stolen passports.

Britain carried out 140 million checks last year against the database - more than the rest of Europe combined.

France carried out the second highest number at 10million.
