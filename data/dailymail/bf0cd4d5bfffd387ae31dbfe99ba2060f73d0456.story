Stuart Broad could be the batsman dressed as Batman when England face India in the final Test at The Oval later in the week.

Broad, who broke his nose at Old Trafford, will play in a mask in south London and put a couple of potential ones on Twitter.

The fast bowler tweeted: 'Just browsing the web for a mask to wear at the Oval. Couple of early favourites....' with pictures of Batman and supervillain Bane. A follower later posted the suggestion of a Hannibal Lecter mask.

Broad will follow the example of footballers such as Paul Gascoigne and wear a protective face mask to ensure that he can play in the final Test at The Oval.

The nasty blow Broad took when he top-edged a bouncer from Varun Aaron into the gap between the peak of his helmet and grille during England’s thumping fourth Test win looked to have ruled him out.

But he emerged from a Manchester hospital and ruled out reconstructive surgery before insisting he will be fit to play, complete with a mask, on Friday.  

‘It was a big impact but if there’s no risk we will play him, no doubt about that,’ said England coach Peter Moores. ‘It is a big game at The Oval and we want him there. If that means playing with a football face mask so be it. He will have panda eyes. He will look lovely.’
