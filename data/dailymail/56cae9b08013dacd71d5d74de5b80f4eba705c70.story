Concerns: Evidence casts doubt on testimony that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death

New evidence has surfaced that puts fresh doubt on the guilt of a man executed for burning his three children to death in a fire.

Cameron Todd Willingham was put to death in Texas in 2004 after prison informer Johnny E. Webb told jurors the defendant had confessed the crime to him.

But since then, experts investigating the house fire in Corsicana, have said the science used to convict Willingham was faulty while wrongful-conviction advocates have argued that the State's death penalty system is severely flawed.

Now a report has revealed that Webb describes in taped interviews how he lied on the witness stand - in return for a reduction in his sentence for robbery.

Willingham was sentenced to death in 1992 after being convicted of murder based on arson analysis and testimony from the jailhouse informant.

The report published in The Marshall Project sites 'newly uncovered letters and court files' showing that the prosecutor 'worked diligently' to intercede for Webb after he had stood before jurors in the Willingham case.

The report says: 'Along with Webb’s account, the letters and documents expose a determined, years-long effort by the prosecutor to alter Webb’s conviction, speed his parole, get him clemency and move him from a tough state prison back to his hometown jail.

'Had such favorable treatment been revealed prior to his execution, Willingham might have had grounds to seek a new trial.'

Willingham maintained his innocence until the day he was executed by lethal injection. 

The former prosecutor named in the 
report, John Jackson, has said that the only help he offered Webb was 
after he thought the prisoner was threatened by other inmates for 
cooperating with prosecutors.

He described as 'complete fabrication' the allegation that he 'coaxed false testimony' from Webb. 

The Innocence Project, an advocacy group based in New York, has been examining the case for the last ten years.

But earlier this year, it revealed that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has denied its petition to posthumously pardon Willingham.

The Innocence Project later said the parole board's decision 'illustrates that the clemency system is completely broken in Texas.'
