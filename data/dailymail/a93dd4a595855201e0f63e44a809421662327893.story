The alleged victim was said to have consented to sex with one of the boys, but three others joined in despite her protests, reported CBS Denver.

Court documents also alleged that the same girl was later assaulted by two boys in a tent.

The attack reportedly only ended when the mother of one of the accused called him inside, according to CBS Denver. 

A number of those involved are believed to attend Englewood High School and letters were reportedly sent to families to let them know that counsellors were on hand for any students upset by the incident.

One supect, named as Daylon Benjamin Hill, 19, is being held at Arapahoe County Jail on a $50,000 bond.
