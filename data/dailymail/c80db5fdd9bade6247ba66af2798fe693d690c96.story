The mystery of a Russian-born British media magnate who disappeared four years ago amid fears he was the victim of a KGB plot may finally have been solved after the discovery of a body.

Police in Latvia believe they have found the corpse of Leonid Rozhetskin, a jet-setting filmmaker and  co-founder of the free London business newspaper City AM, hidden in a remote forest.

The flamboyant lawyer and tycoon, who liked to dine at the Wolseley in Piccadilly and at the fashionable Japanese restaurant Nobu, vanished in March 2008 from his blood-stained £1 million holiday villa in the Baltic Sea resort of Jurmala. At the time he was embroiled in a business dispute with a close associate of President Vladimir Putin.

Mr Rozhetskin is thought to have angered Leonid Reiman, a friend of Mr Putin and at the time Russia’s powerful telecommunications  minister, during a £130 million deal involving a mobile phone company in which Mr Reiman was alleged to have had financial interests.

Legal action was threatened and the previously extrovert Mr Rozhetskin became reclusive and surrounded himself with bodyguards before fleeing abroad.

Mr Reiman has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

Yesterday Mr Rozhetskin’s New York-based mother Elvira, 72, told how she received a mysterious phone call from a Russian-speaking man who said that a body had been discovered. ‘He said that a man had been found in the forest near Tukums in Latvia and there was a credit card on the body with my son’s name on it.’

When her son went missing, she claimed he had been murdered because he was committed to exposing corruption in Mr Putin’s government. Mrs Rozhetskin told The Mail on Sunday at the time: ‘My son isn’t missing. My son is dead.’

Days before his disappearance,  the 41-year-old had moved his  partner Natalya Belova, a glamorous blonde former model 17 years his junior, and their son Max, then aged three, into a £3 million apartment in Central London which he intended to be the family’s main home.

Mr Rozhetskin had told friends he feared for his life, and had opted to live in London for security reasons and because he wanted his son to have a British education.

Police in Riga confirmed last week that they had found a body along with a credit card belonging to the tycoon. The badly decomposed remains are undergoing DNA and forensic tests and results should be known this week, but a senior police source close to the four-year investigation said: ‘It is very likely that the body is Leonid Rozhetskin’s.’

If the remains are identified as Mr Rozhetskin’s, it will be a major breakthrough in one of the most disturbing cases linked to Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union.

There have been persistent claims Mr Rozhetskin staged his death and fled to the United States, possibly under the witness protection programme with the help of the FBI.

Deepening the mystery, his £9 million plane left Latvia soon after his disappearance and in the following days flew on an unexplained odyssey that took in Vienna, Geneva, Norway, Newfoundland and Luton.

Then, late in 2008, a former close business partner of Mr Rozhetskin, Vladimir Smolyaninov, claimed he had been told that the tycoon had  received plastic surgery in Miami and was living under an assumed identity in the Caribbean.
