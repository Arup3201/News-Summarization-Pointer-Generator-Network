A call girl has told a court she is 'deeply ashamed' about taking selfies next to the body of a dead teacher who she and her boyfriend are alleged to have injected with a lethal dose of heroin.

Kirsty Edmondson, 23, and Christopher Sawyers, 36, are accused of killing 47-year old former history teacher Kenneth Chapman at a flat in Eccles, near Salford, by injecting him with the drug.

As he lay dead, the pair used mobiles phones to take 'trophy photos'
 of themselves before having sex on his bed, jurors were told.

Kirsty Edmondson, 23, left, and Christopher Sawyers, 36, killed a former history teacher by giving him a lethal dose of heroin, a court heard. They are alleged to have taken 'trophy pictures' of themselves with the corpse

The pair killed former history teacher Kenneth Chapman, pictured, at a flat in Eccles, near Salford, a court heard. They then allegedly lived with his body for up to a week before stealing his money and television

The pair lived with Mr Chapman’s corpse 
for up to a week - during which time they stole his TV and computer before raiding 
his bank account in a string of online frauds, Manchester Crown Court was told.

They even texted the victim’s sister pretending to be the deceased asking if she could lend him 
£75.

Later Sawyers allegedly showed one of the 
photos to his friends saying: 'Look at this. I will show you a photo of a
 corpse.'

Chapman’s body was eventually found on January 12 this year - 15 days after his death.

It is alleged the pair murdered Chapman after they discovered he was sitting on £18,000 following the sale of his house.

But in court today, Edmondson insisted she was not a 'cold, callous killer'

She added she 'wouldn't kill anybody' before insisting: 'I’m not a killer, it’s not how it looks'

Call girl Edmondson told Manchester Crown Court today she was 'deeply ashamed' of what had happened - and insisted the alleged murder 'wasn't what it looked like'

The court heard how the 23-year-old had been having a fling with the victim after he used her services. She told the court Mr Chapman was the 'best person I knew in my life'

Edmondson, who admits stealing money and property, told the court today she was 'deeply ashamed of what I have done before and after he died.'

She continued: 'I might not be sat here bawling but 
when I go back to that sweat box and realise everything that’s happened,
 believe me, I’m paying for it.

'I would never kill Kenneth Chapman. I wouldn’t kill anyone but I definitely wouldn’t kill him.

'I’m not that type of person. I have 
got no reason to want him dead. I didn’t do anything towards killing 
him. Christopher Sawyers did.'

Edmondson and Sawyers, who is known by the nickname Twinny, both deny the murder.

The court heard how Edmondson had been 
having a fling with the victim who is originally of Cockburnspath, near 
Berwick-upon-Tweed after Mr Chapman began using her services.

Mr Chapman's body was found 15 days after he died in a flat in Eccles, pictured. During the time the pair lived with his body, they texted his sister pretending to be the deceased and asked for £75

In her defence Edmondson said she 
stole Chapman’s TV, games console and bank cards - but claimed he was semi-conscious after being injected with the drug when she did so.

When asked about the selfies she replied: 'I don’t know the reason for taking it. I’m not a killer, it’s not how it looks.

'Twinny asked me if Ken had any family who could put money in. I said he had a sister and he told me to text asking so I did.'

She
 said she was petrified of Sawyer and he forced her to lie and cover up
 events until she eventually spoke to the police on January 14 - two days
 after Mr Chapman’s body was found.

The prosecution showed Edmondson the 'trophy photos' in court and said: 'This is an example of how cold and callous your are'

She added: 'It was eating me up inside that Ken’s body had been found.

'I told the police he had overdosed. Twinny kept getting it in my head that if I told the truth and he had done it then I would be going to prison for it with him.'

'My head was f*****, my life was f*****. My life was not normal before him [Sawyers]. I had Ken and was doing what I do but it was my normality. I met him and my life went upside down.

'He killed the best person I knew in my life. I’ve had time to reflect in prison for the last four months. I know what he did and I was there and seen it.

'Twinny told me we were both going to prison if we didn’t stick together. I don’t know why I stuck by him, it was just a situation that got out of control.

'I felt like I couldn’t go nowhere because I had to make money to look after both of us.

'I could have gone to the police but I thought I would be doing myself harm. I thought I was going to prison for murder.

'If you are never in that situation you don’t know what you will do. I was petrified of him.'

But Tony Cross QC prosecuting showed Edmondson one of the pictures taken after Chapman’s death saying: 'This is an example of how cold and callous you are - this is a photo taken on the evening you had killed Kenneth Chapman.

'You told your representative these photos were when you were smashed out of your face. Being off your head does not provide you with a defence.

'No-one forced the camera into your hands. Christopher Sawyers wasn’t threatening you.

'He didn’t arrange you in the sitting room. You were standing within touching distance of the corpse of Kenneth Chapman. This is a trophy photo.'

Sawyers also denies the manslaughter of former accountant Peter Clark, 
60, who suffered a fatal heart attack after he was given heroin on July 5
 2012.

The trial continues.
