It might seem like just yesterday that an 18-year-old Britney Spears burst onto the music scene wearing a schoolgirl outfit in her Baby One More Time video.

However, the pop singer is today celebrating her 33rd birthday.

From that red jumpsuit for Oops I Did It Again, to the matching denim ensemble she and then boyfriend Justin Timberlake wore to the American Music Awards in 2001, the mother of two is renowned for having some of the best - and worst - outfits in pop history.

Happy Birthday Britney! As the singer turns 33 her best and worst outfits are revealed

Britney's first iconic outfit was the schoolgirl costume she wore in the Baby One More Time video

Britney’s sartorial choices have had her fans in awe for more than 15 years.

Never one to shy away from flashing the flesh, she's often seen writhing around on stage in crop tops and tiny hotpants.

And who can forget the bejewelled nude jumpsuit she wore for her Toxic video in 2003 – a look which Britney once described as her ‘personal favourite'?

Of course, there have been many hits – Britney looked stunning at Elton John’s 2013 Oscar’s party in a plunging sequin gown.

And many misses – her 2002 VMA’s leather look outfit would have been more at home in an S&M club than on the red carpet.

But when it comes to fashion, Britney says that if she had her time over she ‘wouldn’t do anything differently'.

However, the singer admits that when it comes to her down time, she prefers a casual look to her out-there on stage outfits.

She once revealed: ‘I love my jeans and my sweats - I’m really just a tomboy at heart. So it’s really hard for me to be like Kim Kardashian and be makeup- and hair-ready every time I go out of my house.

‘I’m not a believer in that, you know? On the other hand, when you do wear those sweats, you’re like, "Oh God, I should step it up a notch".’

Just like her wardrobe choices, Britney's career has been full of ups and downs. 

After leaving the squeaky clean Micky Mouse Club, which she joined in 1992, to pursue a career in pop, Britney saw huge success with her first four albums.

However, during 2006 and into 2007 Britney began to go off the rails. The singer suffered from a number of mental health issues and was hospitalised on more than one occasion.

In January 2008, she was again taken into care and was committed to the psychiatric ward of the Ronald Raegan UCLA Medical Center.

Her two children with dancer Kevin Federline - Jayden James and Sean - were put under the care of her father Jamie Spears.

Since then Britney has worked hard to rebuild her life, and although her father still has a conservatorship over her, she has gone on to once again enjoy huge success. 

She has even launched her own lingerie line named Intimate Britney Spears.  

In 2013 she began a Las Vegas residency which will run until September 2015. The perfect opportunity for her to show off more of her fabulous (and freaky) outfits.
