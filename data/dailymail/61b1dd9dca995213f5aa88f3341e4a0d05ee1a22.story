The brothers accused of strangling Autumn Pasquale may have been implicated after they exchanged a chilling message on Facebook hours after she was murdered.

Justin, 15, and Dante Robinson, 17, are accused of killing the New Jersey 12-year-old for her BMX 
bike parts. Their mother turned them in after she allegedly saw a message Justin wrote to his older brother simply saying 'Autumn'.

The boys have been charged with murder, conspiracy to commit 
murder, disposing of a body, tampering with evidence and theft. Justin 
was also charged with luring.

Justin also wrote on his Facebook wall 'Might be moving', followed by a sad face and 'liked' the page set up to find her, despite allegedly knowing she was already dead.

Brothers: Dante, 17, left, and Justin, 15, right, are accused of luring Autumn Pasquale to their home with the promise of bike parts and murdering her

Clues: Justin Robinson wrote on his Facebook wall 'Might be moving', followed by a sad face and 'liked' the page set up to find her, despite allegedly knowing she was already dead

Evidence: An investigator loads into a police van a BMX bicycle in Clayton, New Jersey, removed yesterday from the house where the body of Autumn Pasquale was found

The same? Authorities did not confirm the bike was the one belonging to Autumn, but it matched the description of the white BMX she was seen riding Saturday afternoon before she disappeared

Police believe the teens lured 12-year-old 'tomboy' Autumn Pasquale to their home on Saturday night under the pretense of trading bike parts and killed her.

An autopsy performed yesterday 
concluded she had died from 'blunt force trauma, consistent with 
strangulation'. She was also beaten. There was no evidence of sexual 
assault.

Gloucester County Prosecutor Sean 
Dalton said the boys may have wanted parts from Autumn’s bike. They 
turned themselves in on Tuesday.

Justin is a student at Clayton High 
School, while Dante is a student at Bankbridge Regional School in 
Gloucester County, a school for students with behavioral and 
developmental disabilities.

Tragic end: Autumn Pasquale's body was recovered late Monday night from a recycling bin

On Sunday night, while people from all
 over the area were searching for Autumn, Justin joined the 17,000 
people on Facebook who liked the FIND AUTUMN PASQUALE page, according to Philly.com.

A break in the case came when the 
teens' mother alerted investigators to a Facebook post on one of her 
son's accounts, though it is not clear which son and what the post 
actually said.

After obtaining a warrant to search the teens' home, authorities found 
some of Autumn’s belongings including the white BMX bike she was last 
seen riding when she left her West High Street home Saturday afternoon 
around 12:30pm.

The house was a place where teens 
frequently hung out and had parties, some neighbors said, and one of the
 brothers often bought and sold BMX bicycle parts.

According to Philly.com, family and 
friends were already leaving messages on Justin Robinson's wall saying 
they loved him and asking him to pray for forgiveness.

The teen's eldest brother Michael wrote: 'I love you so much little brother.'

Some messages however, were not so 
supportive. Autumn's older brother A.J wrote: 'I know u won't see this 
but I'm just letting u know that I am coming for [you] next time I see 
ur face or ur brother donte [sic] I'm kicking ur asses.'

It is unclear whether Dante had a Facebook or not.

Yesterday, an investigator wheeled a 
white, BMX-style bicycle from the Robinson house. Autumn's uncle James 
Spadafora is said to have recognized it immediately and holding his 
mouth said: 'Oh, my God, no. Oh, my God, that's it.'

Investigators also took bicycle rims from the house.

Dalton said his office was 'strongly considering' waiving both teens to adult court.

The boys themselves were in plain 
sight at points in the intense search for Autumn. Several people in town
 said they saw them both at the vigil held on Monday night in hopes that
 she would be found while allegedly knowing exactly where she was.

Joyce Fisher, who lives across the street from the boys, said: 'We all thought that he was some creep luring children.'

Philip Wames, another neighbor, said he was conflicted. 'It's almost like a relief that it's not some creepo,' he said.

The boys are expected in court for a detention hearings Friday.

Autumn's body was discovered on Monday night in a blue recycling bin. Tuesday was trash collection day, 
and many residents had dragged their trash cans and recycling bins to 
the curb the night before.

The covered recycling bins are collected by 
an automated truck that picks them up and dumps the contents into the 
back.

Police barricaded the block, and 
friends and neighbors came by to see.

Some mothers said they were 
keeping their kids out of school for the day.

Even before the body was 
found, students reported that Spirit Week had been canceled because of 
the sorrow.

One young man rode a bike up, sat on a porch of a home and cried, then biked away.

Clayton Mayor Thomas Bianco walked to 
the scene, cried, hugged a police officer and gave a brief statement to 
the gathered reporters.

'You hear about it in other places but never think it would happen in our little town,' he said.

Howard Kowgill, 60, who lives in town 
and, like many, knows members of Autumn's family, said the discovery of 
the body changes the nature of the town.

Dalton said: 'This is a very sad 
day for the Pasquale family. Our hearts go out to the family and to all 
the residents of Clayton who stood together in support of this young 
girl.'

About 200 law enforcement officials and hundreds more volunteers searched for Autumn after she was reported missing.

Her parents - Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell - did not 
speak at the news conference. Both wept during the evening vigil.

Autumn, whose 13th birthday would have been next Monday, was last 
seen around 12.30pm on Saturday pedaling her white bicycle away from the
 Clayton home where she lives with her father, her two siblings, her 
father's girlfriend and the girlfriend's children.

A
 friend, DeAnna Edwards-McMillen, 11, said Autumn was at her 
house on Friday night and they exchanged text messages on Saturday.

She 
said she received the last one at 1.22pm and didn't believe it was 
intended for her. She said it read, 'don't be like that'.

DeAnna
 said her friend was nice and easy to be around: 'She didn't hate 
people and
 people didn't hate her.' DeAnna's mother, Debi McMillen, said that Autumn was often at their house and that she always went home before her 8pm curfew.

The
 last known communication was in a text message she sent at around 2.30pm.

Mr Dalton would not say who received 
the message or what it contained, but he added that there was nothing 
alarming or unusual about it.

It
 wasn't until about 9.30pm that she was reported missing - 90 minutes 
past her 8pm curfew, said Paul Spadofora, a family spokesman, the uncle 
of Autumn's father and the girl's godfather.

Frantic search: Autumn was reported missing from her Clayton home on Saturday evening; she had last been seen leaving the house that afternoon on her BMX bicycle

Appeal: Since Autumn went missing at the weekend, pictures and fliers have been passed around Clayton in the hope of finding her until her uncle confirmed it was her body found

SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20: Autumn Pasquale, who was a week away from her 13th birthday, was last seen riding her BMX bicycle, leaving her home in Clayton, New Jersey.

Authorities – from the Gloucester County police to the FBI – joined the search. Her father, Tony Pasquale, told NBC News at the time that the disappearance was ‘not like her.’

SUNDAY, OCTOBER 21: Hundreds of people gathered at a local church to hand out flyers and form search parties for the freckled blonde. 

MONDAY, OCTOBER 22: Hundreds more join search efforts for Autumn, spanning into Delaware and New York, according to NBC Philadelphia.

After sunset, worried friends and family held a candlelit vigil to pray for her safe return. Not long after the vigil ended, authorities said that they discovered her 5ft2in body dumped in a recycling container five blocks from her home. 

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23: A press conference was held in the afternoon to say that two brothers, aged 15 and 17, had been arrested for Autumn’s murder.

Authorities also said that the brother’s mother, spotting a suspicious post on Facebook, turned them into police.
