More than two million Muslim pilgrims gathered at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Saturday as they took part in one of the final rites of the annual hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.

These incredible photos from inside and outside Islam’s most sacred mosque show scores of people completing a five-day religious journey that is considered one of the Muslim faith’s greatest acts of worship.

Wearing unstitched folds of white cloth, gathered around the cube-shaped Kaaba – the holiest site in Islam.

More than two million Muslim pilgrims gathered at the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest mosque, to mark the end of their hajj pilgrimage

Hajj is one of the largest gatherings of people in the world and every adult Muslim is required to complete the pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime as long as they are physically and financially capable of making the expensive and difficult journey.

Every year, Muslim faithful from about 160 countries converge on the Islamic city of Mecca and other locations in western Saudi Arabia to complete the holy journey.

The week of Hajj occurs during the last month of the Islamic calendar and it requires pilgrims to perform a number of services or rituals before arriving in Mecca.

The tasks include visiting Mount Arafat on the first day, visiting Muzdalifah after sunset on the second day, throwing stones at pillars that symbolise the devil, and shaving one’s head.

With the conclusion of hajj – the fifth of the pillars of Islam – Muslims are now celebrating the start of Islam’s biggest holiday.

Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, commemorates what Muslims believe was Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail - the Biblical Ishmael, though Christians and Jews believe his other son Isaac was the near-sacrifice - as a test of his faith from God. In the end, he is provided with a sheep to sacrifice instead.

In remembrance, Muslims around the world slaughtered sheep and other livestock on Saturday, giving some meat to the poor.

Because Eid follows the Muslim lunar calendar that depends on sightings of the moon, some Muslims will be celebrating the first day of Eid on Sunday, including Iraqi Shiites and the majority of Indonesians in the world's most populous Muslim nation of 240 million. Pakistan will celebrate on Monday.

During this year’s pilgrimage, officials in Saudi Arabia took extra precautions to ensure the Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa remains outside the kingdom and to prevent the spread of the deadly MERS coronavirus.

Muslims from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea – the countries hardest hit in the Ebola epidemic – were not given visas by Saudi Arabia as a precaution against the virus, a measure that affected 7,400 would-be pilgrims from these nations.
