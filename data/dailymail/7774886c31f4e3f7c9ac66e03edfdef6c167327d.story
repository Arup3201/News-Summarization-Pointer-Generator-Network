Chris Christie's political mentor has said he is losing faith in the New Jersey governor over the Bridgegate scandal and that his protegee could be 'finished.'

Thomas Kean, himself a former governor of New Jersey, said that he does not know if he will support Christie if he runs for President in 2016 because he is so damaged.

In a withering assessment, Kean said that Christie's weakness is that he holds grudges for years and that if you don't obey him he 'makes you feel that your life's going to be very unhappy.'

That one of Christie's closest friends could be abandoning him is a deeply worrying sign that his political career is in jeopardy.

Christie has been under fire since it emerged that his top aides closed two lanes of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey and caused traffic chaos to take revenge on the town's Democrat mayor for not supporting him.

Christie has always denied he knew what was going on and claimed he was 'blindsided' by the actions of his top lieutenants.

But critics have refused to believe this and say he is still not telling the truth.

Kean, 78, first met Christie when he was 14 after delivering a speech at his junior high school.

Christie told his mum that he wanted to be a politician and so his mum took him to meet Kean, starting a friendship that would span decades.

In an interview with the New Yorker, Kean said there were lingering questions about whether Christie 'created an atmosphere in which some of those people thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people.'

Kean said: 'That's possible. If you cross Christie, he'll come back at you, even years later. So his people might have picked up that kind of thing.'

New Yorker journalist Ryan Lizza asked: 'What if he did know?'

Mentor: Thomas Kean, pictured, was New Jersey governor between 1982 and 2000 and also served as the chairman of the 9/11 Commission which looked into the September 11 2011 terrorist attacks. He and Christie met when Christie was still at high school

Kean said: 'And he's just telling a lie to everybody? Well, then he's finished. As governor, too.'

In
 the interview Kean said that he and Christie have not spoken since his 
re-election night last November because they had fallen out, though he 
did not specify why exactly.

The
 fight brought an end to the friendship which had seen Christie work for
 Kean during his gubernatorial election campaigns and become close to 
the man the New Yorker calls 'arguably the most important political 
figure in Christie’s career.'

chairman of the 9/11 Commission which looked into the September 11 2011 
terrorist attacks.

Kean said that Christie's problem is that he 'doesn't always try to persuade you with reason.'

He also is hampered by the fact that he 'makes enemies and keeps them,' he said.

Kean said: 'He makes you feel that your life's going to be very unhappy if you don't do what he says...

'...As long as you're riding high, they'll stay in the weeds, because they don't want to get in your way.

'But you get in trouble, they'll all come out of the weeds, and come at you.'

Asked about the 2016 Presidential election, Kean said: 'I haven't decided whether I'm going to support him or not.

'There are a lot of people (candidates) I don’t know that well and I'd like to get to know them better.'

Another reason that Kean feels angry at Christie is his treatment of his son Thomas Kean Jr, who is tipped to run for New Jersey governor in 2017.

After Christie's re-election he supposedly wanted to remove Kean Jr from his position as New Jersey Senate Minority Leader.

The New Yorker claims that with the support of Stephen Sweeney, the Democrat Senate Majority Leader, he 'attempted to engineer a coup' against Kean Jr.

During the plot Kean Jr was supposedly summoned to Christie's office where he was told by the governor's chief of staff, Kevin O'Dowd, to step aside.

Kean Jr refuse and survived, staying in his post having won the votes of colleagues.

His father heard about the plot and called Christie and was told that the governor had nothing to do with it, which appears to be a lie.

Kean said: 'I thought at some point 
the Governor would call me and say: "Hey, you gotta understand this, I 
had to do this for this reason or that reason."'

'Whatever. But he never called me. The last time I talked to him was Election Night.'

The Bridgegate row dates back to September 9th last year when two of the three lanes going to the George Washington Bridge, one of the major arteries into New York City, were closed.

Traffic chaos ensued during what was the first week of school. Paramedics said calls took up to three times as long to respond than they should have done.

Emergency responders took seven minutes to get to a 91-year-old woman who died at hospital after an ambulance was delayed getting to her.

Police were also hampered in their response to finding a missing four-year-old boy and responding to a traffic accident.

Meanwhile, among Christie's top aides it all seemed like good sport.

In an email apparently ordering the lane closures, Bridget Kelly wrote to David Wildstein, another senior Christie official: 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.'

He replied: 'Got it.'

Kelly was fired by Christie and Wildstein quit in December.

A recent poll made clear the effect that the Bridgegate scandal has had on Christie, whose popularity soared after Superstorm Sandy struck America in 2012 due to his strong leadership.

The survey found that 45 per cent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Christie, and 34 per cent have a favorable opinion.

In January a YouGov/Huffington Post poll found that just 34 per cent of respondents said they had an unfavorable view of him and 38 per cent had a positive view of him.
