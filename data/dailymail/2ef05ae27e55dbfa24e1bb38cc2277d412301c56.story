Animal control workers have removed sixty cats from the home of 'hoarder' in Berwyn, Illinois.

Workers at the shelter who now looking after the animals fear there are still another two dozen cats inside.

Three dogs from the same residence have already been removed from the home which has been described by police as uninhabitable.

Removal: The cats were removed from the house in cages and taken to a local animal shelter

Concerned: Three dogs from the same residence have already been removed from the home which has been described by police as uninhabitable

According to neighbors a family of three lived in the building, including a woman who volunteers at animal shelters, reported the Chicago Tribune.

Police were called to the home after getting complaints from people living in the area. 

Cicero Animal 
Welfare Department manager Michael McKee, who runs the shelter where the 
animals are being cared for, said the residents were apparently hoarders.

This makes catching
the remaining animals more challenging for animal control workers.

They set up traps 
inside and outside the house to catch the animals.

Mr McKee explained animal officials were able to
corner some of the cats and dogs into one room on Monday.

They managed to transfer them into cages before taking 
them to the shelter

He said a vet was examining the animals, but the police described them as looking in a poor state.

Residents: According to neighbors said a family of three lived in the house, including a woman who volunteers at animal shelter

Capture: Animal control workers set up traps inside and outside the house to catch the remaining animals

Berwyn police Cmdr. Michael Cimaglia said the home was uninhabitable and that some of animals appeared sickly.

A neighbor who lives across the street, Rita Feliciano, told the newspaper that a married couple live in the house with a teenage daughter and that the mother was a 'very nice person.'

She added' but you can't live like that.'

No charges have yet been filed.
