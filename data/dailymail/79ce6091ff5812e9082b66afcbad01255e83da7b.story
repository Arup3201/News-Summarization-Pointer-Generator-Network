Enrique Garcia Martinez, otherwise known as Kike, paid off another slice of his £3million transfer fee as he fired Middlesbrough to victory at the Macron Stadium on Tuesday night.

It was the Spanish striker’s third goal in four games in all competitions since moving to Teesside from Murcia this summer, and gave Aitor Karanka’s side a much-needed lift following Saturday’s last-minute defeat at Leeds.

It looked as though Boro would have to settle for a point after captain Grant Leadbitter converted a penalty at the end of the first half to cancel out a spot-kick from Craig Davies in the 27th minute.

But when substitute Adam Reach touched Lee Tomlin’s pass into Kike’s path 12 minutes from time, the 24-year-old stole in ahead of Adam Bogdan to lift it over the Bolton keeper and into the net.

‘Everyone knows how important Kike is for the team, said Karanka. ‘The other lads know that when we create one chance Kike is going to be there to score.

‘We have a better squad than last year, better players and with these kind of players we be at the top.’

There were boos from the home fans at the final whistle as Bolton were left waiting for their first league win of the season. This was their second defeat in three games and the second time in four days they surrendered the lead following Saturday’s draw at home to Nottingham Forest.

It had looked a whole lot brighter for Bolton when Davies smashed his penalty past goalkeeper Tomas Mejias after he had been brought down by Seb Hines midway through the first half.

Bolton boss Dougie Freedman was convinced that Hines should have been sent off, however. ‘That decision was a game-changer, simple as that,’ he said.

‘I don’t like to talk about referees but sometimes I’ve got to stand up for my team. Simple rules tell you that if someone is straight through and he’s pulled down, there is no covering defender (it’s a red card).

‘It was a shocking decision. We go 1-0 up and they are down to 10 men – it gives us a chance to win the game.’

Leadbitter levelled from the spot in added time at the end of the half when Kike flicked on a freekick and the ball hit David Wheater on the arm, with Bolton’s protesting in vain that it had come off the big defender’s thigh first.

Bolton’s misery was complete when substitute Jermaine Beckford had an effort ruled out for a push late on.
