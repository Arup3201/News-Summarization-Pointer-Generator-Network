Lone MI5 agent: The officer was sent to infiltrate groups of traitors by security chiefs alarmed at the strength of support for Adolf Hitler (pictured)

A lone MI5 agent went undercover to neutralise hundreds of Nazi sympathisers living in Britain during the Second World War, extraordinary secret papers reveal today.

The officer, given the alias Jack King, was sent to infiltrate groups of traitors by security chiefs alarmed at the strength of support for Hitler.

By posing as an undercover Gestapo officer, King was able to control groups of ‘Fifth Columnists’ who were trying to aid the Fascist cause.

The Nazi sympathisers believed they were successfully passing secrets to Berlin – but all the while the information was being handed straight to MI5, say the newly declassified files released by the National Archives.

MI5 acquired replica Iron Crosses to reward members of King’s network for their loyalty to the Fuhrer.

Officials even drew up plans to issue the Nazi sympathisers with badges to be worn in the event of an invasion – supposedly to identify them to the Germans as friends but in fact to enable them to be rounded up by police. 

The traitors were never prosecuted, to avoid blowing future operations, and went to their graves believing they had helped Hitler.

By the end of the war, King – also known as SR – had monitored and controlled the activities of hundreds of would-be traitors. Had the network not been penetrated, it could have done significant harm, MI5 said.

The Nazi sympathisers, based mainly in London and the south of England, used messages written in invisible ink and other ruses to pass details of Home Guard operations and intelligence on jet propulsion and radar systems.

King’s work started when he was tasked
 with gauging the extent of Nazi support among employees of Siemens in 
the UK. The company was known to have provided a cover for Nazi 
espionage.

But the plan changed when in 1942, he met a ‘crafty and dangerous woman’.

Marita Perigoe, said to be of mixed 
Swedish and German origin, was married to a member of Oswald Mosley’s 
British Union of Fascists who had been interned in Brixton Prison.

She, however, had no time for the BUF, regarding them as ‘insufficiently extreme’.

The
 MI5 files state: ‘She was found to be so violently anti-British and so 
anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt 
that special attention should be paid to her.

‘Marita Perigoe is not a neurotic nor 
feminine type; she is a masterful and somewhat masculine woman. Both in 
appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant Hun.’

King
 managed to convince her that he was a Gestapo representative looking 
for people ‘a hundred per cent loyal to the Fatherland’ who could be 
relied upon to help the Nazis in the event of an invasion.

‘The
 organisation has certain somewhat melodramatic ideas about secret 
service work and to gratify these a suitable meeting place in the 
basement of an antique shop has been found,’ MI5 reported in 1942. 
‘Arrangements have been made to record any conversations.’

MI5 files note that while some of the 
Fifth Columnists had a ‘lack of balance’ or were ‘semi-lunatic’ they 
were still dangerous ‘since Hitler himself is stated on occasions to 
bite the carpet’.

One, 
Hilda Leech, was ‘unstable and neurotic’ and violently anti-Semitic. She
 tried to pass on reports about highly secret research to develop a jet 
aircraft.

Edgar Whitehead, an astrologer, was passing on information about secret trials of a new amphibious tank.

The National Council for Civil  Liberties – now known as  Liberty – gave prominent roles to two suspected Communists, the secret files reveal.

One man, Kenelm Hubert Digby, who is described as ‘a sincere lifelong Communist’, held the role of legal adviser in the 1940s.

A second individual, Geoffrey Cecil Bing, was an NCCL member and also part of the Communist Party’s secret legal group. He was elected a Labour MP in the 1945 Clement Atlee landslide.

Labour became paranoid the party was being infiltrated by Communists and asked MI5 to vet a list of its MPs, but security officials refused.

Bing lost his seat in 1955 and became an adviser to Ghana PM Kwame Nkrumah, where he was described by the Security Service as ‘the most formidable threat to British interests there’.

As King’s network expanded, MI5 was looking at new ways to subvert its activities.

The files state: ‘It is proposed at a later stage to provide all members of the organisation with badges, which will probably take the form of some innocuous object like the Union Jack, which they will be instructed to hide until orders are given from headquarters.

‘From then onwards they will wear them. The object of this plan is to enable the police easily to identify members of this Fifth Column organisation in time of emergency.’

By the end of the war, Perigoe was one of six agents – all but one of them British – working directly to King.

MI5 estimated the number of traitors detailed in his reports ran ‘certainly to scores and probably to hundreds’. Security chiefs at first doubted so many British subjects were traitors.

‘But it gradually became apparent that the bulk of the SR material could be relied on as substantially accurate,’ the files add.

King’s work was directed by Lord Rothschild, who praised the ‘staggering tour de force’ performed by the agent.

He felt King deserved an MBE not just for the intelligence value of his work but for incurring ‘personal danger from his daily contact with Fascists over a period of years’.
