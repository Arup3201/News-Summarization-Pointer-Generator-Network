Susan Warren, who has been dubbed 'The Cleaning Fairy' for tidying up other people's homes without being asked, has been arrested again after police found her clearing snow from a homeowner's driveway in Ohio, police said.

Warren, 53, was sentenced to one year of probation in November after she pleaded guilty to attempted burglary for breaking into another home, cleaning it and leaving a $75 bill for her services.

Warren's latest brush with the law came Tuesday when someone spotted her and recognized her from her earlier break-ins, it was reported.

Not a 'clean' getaway: Warren was arrested after police found her shoveling snow from a homeowner's driveway without permission.

A neighbor said a member of the neighborhood watch spotted Warren and called police to report the 'suspicious female,' Fox 19 reported.

That person 'had called the police, saw the lady out there and recognized the lady as that lady who cleaned houses or whatever before,' the man said.

Elyria Police soon arrived and learned that Warren was on probation for an earlier charge and took her into custody.

Nice work: This is the driveway Warren shoveled without permission. She cleared it completely before being taken away by police.

Warren was arrested on an outstanding warrant but not charged with the shoveling incident, the report said.

In the earlier arrest, Warren told authorities that she was driving by the 
house one day in May and decided she 'wanted something to do.' 

She broke in, washed some coffee cups, took out the trash, vacuumed and dusted inside the house.

Then she left a bill written on a napkin that included her phone number.

No reason: Warren said she was simply driving by the house and 'wanted something to do' so she let herself in and started cleaning the home

When police confronted Warren about the alleged early-morning break in, she told them she 'does it all the time.'

Warren allegedly broke into the home in Westlake, Ohio after picking the house at random while driving down the street, she said.

When the homeowners' 18-year-old daughter woke up to find the house had been cleaned, she assumed her parents had hired a maid, the victim Sherry Bush told WKYC-TV.

Housekeeping bill: The Ohio woman left a handwritten note on a napkin which read 'I was here to clean' along with her name, address and '$75'

'There were some coffee mugs that my husband had out,' she said. 'She had washed them all.

'She wrote a note [on a napkin] and left it on the table, saying, "$75 I was here to clean", and left her name and number,' Bush said. 

Warren says that she owns a cleaning business and sometimes enters homes, cleans them and leaves a bill.
