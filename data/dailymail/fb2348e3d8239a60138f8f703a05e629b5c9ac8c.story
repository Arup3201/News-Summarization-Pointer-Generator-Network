A former star of Casualty had part of his ear bitten off after asking a group of  fellow hotel guests to quieten down.

Clive Mantle, 55, is said to be ‘very badly shaken up’ after what he claims was an unprovoked attack at a Travelodge.

It is understood he was set upon in the early hours of Sunday after asking fellow guests to be quiet.During a scuffle outside his room at the hotel in Newcastle, one man is said to have bitten off part of the actor’s ear – which was later found on the floor and sewn back on by doctors.

Former Casualty actor Clive Mantle has had part of his ear bitten off in an alleged attack in Newvastle

Mr Mantle was allegedly attacked at the Travelodge in Newcastle's Quayside area

Mr Mantle, who played Mike Barratt in the BBC drama, was involved in the incident after asking other guests at the hotel to keep the noise down

Mr Mantle, who also appears in the 
hit US fantasy series Game Of Thrones, was in the city to perform in a 
touring production of The Ladykillers at the Theatre Royal.

A spokesman for his agent,  London-based Saraband Associates, said: ‘He sounds very wobbly.
‘He is very shaken and shocked by what has happened. You don’t expect this kind of thing to happen in a hotel.

‘He said the police, ambulance and hospital staff were amazing.’

The spokesman added that there was ‘no guarantee’ the ear would survive the trauma because it was ‘a while’ before it was found.

He said Mr Mantle had gone out 
barefoot in his pyjama bottoms and a T-shirt in the early hours to ask a
man outside his room to ‘keep the noise down’.

The man, who had been drinking, went away and returned five minutes later with another man.

When Mr Mantle asked them again if they could quieten down, he was attacked and knocked to the floor.

He was taken to Royal Victoria Infirmary where he underwent surgery to reattach his ear.

He is now recovering at home and will
see a specialist in Oxford today to determine whether the operation has
been a success. Mr Mantle, who is separated from his wife and lives in 
Wiltshire with his young son Harry, was playing the role of Major 
Courtney in the Ealing comedy.

He has been forced to cancel his 
remaining performances as a result of the incident, because he has been 
warned by doctors not to get make-up near his wound.

An understudy will replace him until the end of the tour, which is in its final three weeks.

Jon Bath, of producers Fiery Angel, said the attack was ‘horrifying and disgusting and has shaken everyone up’.

There was an outpouring of support 
yesterday from Mr Mantle’s fans on Twitter. Neil Roberts wrote: ‘What 
the hell is wrong with people?’ Gazz Howie wrote: ‘I’d like to “thank” 
my town of Newcastle for living up to every horrible stereotype that’s 
said about it! ... Get well soon Clive Mantle!’

Police said a 32-year-old man from 
Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, has been charged with wounding with intent.
He will appear before Newcastle magistrates next month. Another man has
been released on bail in connection with the incident while a third man
was released without charge.

Mr Mantle played surgeon Mike Barrett
in Casualty. In the 1980s he starred in Robin Of Sherwood, as well as a
BBC Radio 4 comedy sketch show titled, by unfortunate coincidence, In 
One Ear.

A spokesman for the Theatre Royal
in Newcastle, said: ‘He is a lovely man. It is very sad news. We all 
wish him a speedy recovery.’
