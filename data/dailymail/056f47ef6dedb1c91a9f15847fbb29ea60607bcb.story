Home again: Jeremy Clarkson after landing at Heathrow

Jeremy Clarkson said yesterday that ‘lives were at stake’ during his escape from Argentina.

He and fellow Top Gear presenters Richard Hammond and James May had to hide under beds as an angry mob searched their hotel, he said.

Now safely back in the UK, the motormouth TV host reverted to his trademark style, finding a tactless comment or two irresistible.

He said the ‘silver lining’ to the ordeal was that it gave the show’s Christmas special a better ending than they had planned. 

Clarkson also said he would have chosen ‘W3 WON’ as his number plate ‘if I’d been trying to ruffle feathers’.

The trouble was started by a car number plate, H982 FKL, which sparked fury among locals and war veterans who claimed it referred to the 1982 Falklands conflict.

Yesterday Clarkson, 54, said the Porsche he drove during the special edition of the BBC motoring show arrived in Argentina with the H982 FKL plates, but they were removed two days later after a Twitter user pointed out the problem.

By the time the stars reached Tierra del Fuego, south Argentina, the car ‘had no plate at all on the front and a meaningless jumble of letters and numbers on the back,’ he wrote in The Sunday Times. 

'And no, it wasn’t W3 WON. Which it would have been if I’d been trying to ruffle feathers’.

He added: ‘The number plate then wasn’t the issue, but something was causing more and more people to arrive at the hotel. Twitter was rammed with messages from locals saying they wanted blood. One said they were going to barbecue us and eat the meat.’

Clarkson said he, Hammond and May ‘hid under the beds in a researcher’s room while protesters went through the hotel looking for us’. 

Government officials told the Top Gear crew they were no longer welcome and that their safety ‘could not be guaranteed’.

Yesterday Clarkson accused the government of allowing the visit simply to ‘make political capital from ejecting us when we arrived’.

The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said.

The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991.

FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered. In this case it was Maidstone in Kent.

The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA.

Porsche confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner.

It is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £80.

Plates beginning in NIQ or Q - Northern Ireland registered vehicles - cannot be transferred.

Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger.

Filming took place near Ushuaia port from which the General Belgrano sailed before it was sunk by a British submarine. There were questions about the attack’s legitimacy as the Argentine ship was outside the exclusion zone.

Clarkson said the team knew anti-British feelings were still strong there so ‘were on our best behaviour’. But they faced ‘mobs with pickaxe handles, paving stones and bricks’.

He, Hammond, and May and the women in the team flew to Buenos Aires, thinking the stars’ absence would calm things. 

But it did not and the remaining 29 crew members had to escape to Chile by car, including the Porsche. Bricks were thrown at the vehicles and two people were cut by flying glass. Word spread that an ambush was awaiting them.

Clarkson said: ‘The nine of us who had escaped were … working through the night to find a plane and an airfield from which they could get out because, make no mistake, lives were at stake.’

The crew abandoned the cars and, ‘chased by the thugs’, fled to a remote border crossing into Chile.

Argentine papers said Clarkson’s comments, blaming the government for the attack, were ‘a new provocation’.
