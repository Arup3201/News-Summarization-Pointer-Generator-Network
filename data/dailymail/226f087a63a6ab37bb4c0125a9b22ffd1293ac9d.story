With three in five of us claiming that seasonal stress is getting us down and, according to a new study, one in eight saying it's worse than childbirth, the festive season takes its toll on the skin in more ways than one.

But help for stressed skin is at hand in the shape of a new serum that claims to wipe out signs of stress, including wrinkles and dull skin, in just 21 days.

According to makers skyn ICELAND, the plant peptides contained in their £40 Arctic Elixir can also reduce stress induced cell damage, which causes sagging skin and fine lines, by up to 50 per cent.

Making things worse: Stress can have a deleterious effect on your complexion - compounding the issue

'Arctic Elixir contains a special Sodium Hyaluronate complex that instantly smoothes wrinkles,' explains Sarah Kugelman, who created skyn ICELAND after being unable to find products that worked for her stressed, sensitive skin.

'But the real power player in this serum comes from the two plant stem technologies. One is a plant peptide known as "plant collagen" that helps repair and protect skin's DNA. 

'It reduces stress induced cell damage by over 50%, the type of damage that leads to wrinkles and sagging skin.

'The other plant stem cell is extracted from raspberries and is antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It specifically targets stress induced irritation and aging by regulating nitric oxide levels on skin.'

Along with creating wrinkles and dulling skin, according to skincare guru Ole Henriksen, stress can also lead to poor eating habits which make matters even worse.

Solution: skyn ICELAND claim their Arctic Elixir can improved stressed skin in just 21 days

'Stress often makes us reach for all the
 wrong kinds of food,' he reveals. 'Too much sugar and sodium are among the greatest 
enemies of skin.

'Sodium causes bloating and fluid retention in the skin 
(puffy eye region), while an excess of sugar causes the skin to become 
red and rashy and causes eruptions.

'Another thing I have observed is 
when people are highly stressed they show more tension in the face and 
frown more.'

Despite Christmas being just a few weeks away, Henriksen, whose celebrity clients include Kate Moss and Jessica Alba, says there are some easy ways to reduce stress ahead of the big day.

'Stress can 
easily be avoided by organising your daily life,' he explains. 'First start by writing 
down a daily schedule or calendar for both personal and professional use because a
 better overview of things will make you feel more in charge.

'You 
shouldn’t get up five minutes before a meeting - get up early and take your
 time to eat a good breakfast, connect with your family, and give 
yourself ample time to arrive early.

'During the day, if 
you find yourself a little overwhelmed in your head or body, take five 
minutes to do some deep breathing (closing your eyes) and stretching, while
allowing yourself to recharge your batteries.

'Take time for you with 
family and friends, exercise and make sure you laugh.'

TRY TO SLEEP FOR AT LEAST SEVEN TO EIGHT HOURS A NIGHT

'This 
not only helps you recharge and replenish but the body’s own renewal 
happens at this time.   Sleep also helps to lower your cortisol levels,' says Sarah.

She adds: 'When cortisol is too high it has many negative effects on health 
including our skin.  Cortisol increases oil production and can break 
down skin collagen, the protein that keeps skin smooth and elastic.  

GET INTO YOGA

'I've been doing yoga for 15 years and it saved 
me,' Sarah reveals. 'It is not only an incredible way to release tension by stretching 
and relaxing the muscles but it also helps you slow down mentally.  

TUCK INTO MORE TURKEY

'There's a whole list of stress reducing 
foods including oranges, sweet potatoes, apricots, avocados, turkey, 
salmon and kale,' she adds.

'A German study in psychopharmacology found that vitamin
 C helps reduce stress and return blood pressure and cortisol to normal 
levels after a stressful situation.'

PAMPER YOURSELF

'I have spa nights all the time and it's amazing how 
restorative they can be. Take a hot shower in the candlelight, play 
soothing music, slather on a face mask, have a hot cup of tea
 and crawl in bed with a good book.'   

TURBO CHARGE YOUR SKIN

For me, bad skin equals stress and vice versa. I 
think a lot of people feel this way which is why I created skyn ICELAND 
in order to reduce the signs of stress that eventually show up on our skin, 
because stress creates a vicious circle.
