A dog suffered severe burns after his owner dumped her boyfriend who then poured hot water on the animal in a suspected revenge attack.

The dog's owner, Mariah Facca, said she was breaking up with 27-year old Alain Williams Sunday when he told her he poured hot water on her dog Moon at his home, according to police.

The one-year-old dog was rushed to the vets with second-degree burns covering 30 to 40 percent of her body.

The vets are concerned her organs may fail as a result of the burns and if she does recover she will need extensive care, reports WSVN.

It's horrible, you know,' Facca said.

'She doesn't even have any fur. She used to love going in the water.

Vets said Moon will need her bandages to be changed daily for 30 to 90 days and the bills are  expected to exceed $10,000

'I don't even think she wants to be around water.'

Police charged Williams with a count of torment, deprive, mutilate or kill an animal.

'It hurts a lot. I don't want nothing to happen to my dog. I love her so much,' Facca said.

Veterinary Dr. Fumiko Miyamoto said Moon will need her bandages to be changed daily for 30 to 90 days and they are appealing for help to pay for her care at Hollywood Animal Hospital. 

'Her wounds are basically on top of her head right here, the back, the leg and part of her forelegs too, so she has pretty significant burns.'

Moon's medical costs are expected to exceed $10,000, which is an amount Facca can not afford.

On Monday a court judge set Williams' bond for $86,000.

He also faces other charges for behavior during his arrest which included him being Tasered.

Williams also allegedly threatened to 'kill' officers at the police station.
