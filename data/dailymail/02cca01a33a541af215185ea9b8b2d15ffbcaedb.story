Sam Warburton will become Wales’ most capped captain on Saturday after the flanker overcame a knee problem to be named in the starting XV to face Ireland.

The 26-year-old will lead an unchanged line-up for the RBS 6 Nations tie at the Millennium Stadium, where Wales are bidding to keep alive their championship hopes and derail Ireland’s Grand Slam charge.

Warburton, who limped off during the victory over France, will overtake Ryan Jones on his landmark appearance, leading out his country for the 34th time since making his debut back in 2009.

‘Saturday is also a fantastic achievement and honour for Sam,’ said Gatland. ‘He has developed into the role fantastically and is a modern day professional. He is a role model that will continue to get better.'

Gatland has made just two changes to his matchday squad, with forwards Jake Ball and Rob Evans replacing the injured Bradley Davies and Paul James on the bench.

‘We return to the Millennium Stadium after two tough away trips with two victories and will be looking to build on that,’ said the Kiwi. ‘We saw an improvement against Scotland and then saw another step up against France and we know we will need to do the same against Ireland on Saturday. Ireland are the form team in Europe and we know it is going to be a huge battle.

‘The changes on the bench mean Rob Evans gets an opportunity. We have been impressed with him for his region and at training. Our strength in depth in the second-row is highlighted again as Jake comes back into the squad.’
