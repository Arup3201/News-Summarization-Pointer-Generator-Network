Chinese shoppers are on course to smash their own record for online spending today as they took advantage of discounts offered on Singles Day, a festival created by e-tailers to persuade the loveless to console themselves with retail therapy.

In the first six hours of trading alone, customers had spent $1.6billion on China's biggest online trading platform Alibaba Group - and the total figure was predicted to surpass $8billion by the end of the day, possibly even reaching as high as $13billion.

That compares to just $2.3billion in expected sales during America's biggest online shopping day known as 'Cyber Monday' which falls on December 2 and the $1billion spent on 'Black Friday' in the U.S. last year.

November 11 - or 11.11 - was proclaimed Singles Day because of the number of ones in the date, with sellers promoting discounts on everything from boyfriend body pillows to wine to the nation's singletons.

'Male and female singles are no longer depressed now because all their attention is focused on the Internet to buy stuff,' said one sceptical poster on Sina Weibo, a Chinese equivalent of Twitter.

'But afterwards they will realise their problems have not been resolved.'

Taobao and Tmall, two major online shopping websites run by Alibaba, received a phenomenal 340,000 transactions in just the first minute of the annual spree going live at midnight, spending more than $16.4million.

That figure had soared to $1.1billion by the first hour, according to the South China Morning Post.

By 1pm, sales on Tmall hit 19.1 billion yuan ($3.1 billion), company figures showed.

That was around six times the combined average daily turnover on both Tmall and Taobao, Alibaba's consumer-to-consumer arm, last year, according to Chinese media reports.

The $3.1 billion figure was the same as the total for the whole day in 2012, Alibaba said in a statement.

November 11 - or 11.11 - was proclaimed 
Singles Day because of the number of ones in the date.

It was initially celebrated at universities in the 1990s as an excuse for singletons people to party with their loveless friends.

The date was later marketed as a Valentine's Day for singletons by the country's biggest e-commerce firm Alibaba, with lucrative results.

The company does not sell its own merchandise but instead offers a platform for retailers through websites Tmall and Taobao.

Companies play on the idea that it a day for those looking for love to distract themselves by buying all manner of heavily discounted goods from boyfriend body pillows to wine to
 the nation's singletons.

The International Finance News newspaper estimated that this year's total in online sales could be somewhere between $8billion and $13billion.

A poll by Sina.com revealed that more than 60 per cent of respondents said they would shop online today while less than 15 per cent were confident they could resist the sales.

China has the world's biggest online population and its annual online sales are forecast to reach between $420 billion and $650 billion by 2020, by which time it will be the world's largest online retail market, consulting firm McKinsey estimates.

Chinese bricks and mortar retailers are also trying to cash in on the spending spree this year, with department stores and supermarkets offering special prices at the weekend, Chinese media reports said.

But there were doubts over the size of the event's heavily-advertised discounts, with consumer research groups saying retailers quietly raise prices before announcing a dramatic markdown, the state-run Global Times said Monday.

By the end of 2012, China had 242 million online shoppers, up 24.8 per cent in a year.

They spent nearly 1.26 trillion yuan in 2012, up 66.5 per cent from 2011, the semi-official China Internet Network Information Centre said in an April report.
