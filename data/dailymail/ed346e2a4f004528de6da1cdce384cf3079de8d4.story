Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen could face up to 40 years in prison after he admitted recruiting three female officers into a prostitution ring 

An army officer whose role was to advocate for victims of sexual abuse has admitted recruiting cash-strapped female soldiers to work in a prostitution ring. 

Sergeant 1st Class Gregory McQueen recruited the female soldiers to serve as prostitutes for high ranking officers at Fort Hood in Texas - one of the biggest bases in the country. 

One female officer was told she could make lots of money at swinger and stripper parties, while another claimed McQueen arranged for her to have sex with an officer for $100.

At a court martial McQueen admitted  getting the three officers involved in the sex ring, and betraying the trust of commanders who had appointed him as an advocate for victims of sexual abuse at the base, home to 40,000 soldiers, the Austin American-Statesman reported.

McQueen admitted 15 counts including charges of pandering and conspiracy to solicit prostitution. As part of his plea arrangement, other charges were dismissed, but McQueen still faces one count of assault that may be considered by the court later.

He could face up to 40 years in prison.  

One of the female soldiers had previously testified that McQueen arranged for her to have sex for $100 with an officer, Master Sergeant Brad Grimes. 

But prosecutors told Judge Lt. Col. Rebecca Connally that while there were plans for a tryst, the two never had sex.

The woman had told investigators she was 20 when she confided in McQueen about money problems after her husband left her and her three-year-old son and drained the couple's bank account.

She also testified that McQueen had sex with her and took photos of her naked to show potential clients.

Grimes has already been demoted and reprimanded after he was found guilty by a jury conspiring to patronize a prostitute and solicitation to commit adultery.

Initial charges were filed against McQueen in March 2014.

Fort Hood officials haven't indicated whether anyone involved in the conspiracy actually had sex, according to the San Antonio Express-News.

McQueen was an officer in Fort Hood's sexual assault prevention program and counseled victims of abuse.

McQueen admitted breaching his role as an advocate for sexual abuse by encouraging the prostitution ring  

He told the hearing: 'I was fully aware I violated those duties.'  

The maximum penalty for his crimes is 40 years in prison and McQueen could be sentenced later on Thursday. 

In addition to trying to recruit the young female soldiers, McQueen admitted trying to get two higher ranking officers to agree to have sex with junior female officers.

These senior ranking officials refused, KCEN TV reported. 

He told the judge 'I engaged in conduct fully aware of my duties, and I willfully arranged for soldiers to engage in acts of prostitution,' he told the judge. 'My acts discredited the service.'

Speaking after the hearing, South Texas College of Law professor Geoffrey Corn said the case was a 'very rare' occurrence that merited prosecution.

Corn, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and former military lawyer, told mySA: 'Not only is risk of significant punishment necessary for this misconduct, but there is an important deterrent message here. We entrust subordinates to leaders to make them better, not to exploit them.'

The case is part of a spate of sex-related incidents in the military which have prompted further investigation by Congress. The US Senate last year blocked a bill that would have stripped military commanders of their authority to prosecute or prevent charges for alleged rapes and other serious offences.

Instructors, recruits and others have been prosecuted in a series of sex-abuse cases at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. A Pentagon study released last May on sex assault in the military found that more than 5,000 reports of sexual abuse had been filed in the previous fiscal year, a 50 percent increase from the previous 12 months.
