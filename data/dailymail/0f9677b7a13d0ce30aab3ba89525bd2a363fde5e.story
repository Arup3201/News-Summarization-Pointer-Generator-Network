A cliff-side walkway will give people the chance to explore a previously inaccessible Chinese mountain and get spectacular views of the cliffs, peaks and winding paths of an impressive mountain range from 1500ft up. 

Eager explorers have already been testing out the new bridge, which runs through the Wuling Mountain range in the Chongqing Municipality in south west China.  

The long walkway, which is due to be officially opened later this month, stretches through previously unexplored regions of the vast mountain. 

A cliff-side walkway which stretches across the previously inaccessible Wuling mountain range in south west China is to be opened 

It will allow people access to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which is peppered with ravines and gorges with pools and waterfalls, as well as more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars.

A tourism chief said:  'It is actually quite safe and already to use, however we are waiting for the official opening to open it up fully. Some people have been sneaking past the barriers and there isn't any risk, but we really want people to wait until everything is absolutely ready.'

The long walkway is about 800 metres long and its highest point is some 500 metres above the ground, according to The People's Daily Online. 

Wuling Mountain Valley is a 10km long valley, almost entirely covered by forest. 

The 800 metre long walkway has already been explored by tourists, who have jumped over barriers ahead of the bridge's official opening

It covers an area of around 29.96 square kilometres, mainly consisting of valleys, fields, winding tracks and precipices.

Fuling Wuling Tourism Board came up with the idea of a walkway to give people access to the waterfalls, gorges and ravines that were previously inaccessible. 

It is part of a larger project that created a 'Five Area Zone' in 2010, which includes includes Fuling Wuling Mountain, Wuling Goddess Mountain, Fengdu South Heaven Lake.

The long walkway allows people to explore the mountain range's ravines and winding paths as well as get views from 1,500ft up 

The mountain allows access to the UNESCO World Heritage site with its waterfalls, pools and more than 3,000 quartzite sandstone pillars 

The walkway was created by the Fuling Wuling tourism board as a way to give people easy access to the mountain range and its views 

Tourism chiefs said while not officially open yet, the walkway was safe to use but they were trying to wait for the official opening 

In the area the Musk Dear Fort Viewing Platform has already been completed.

If the new walkway proves a success, other similar bridges could be constructed.

Mount Fanjing which is part of the mountain range where the walkway was built is home to the rare Golden monkey and is also regarded as a sacred Buddhist mountain.

Qu Lunming, chief executive of the tourism board, said last year that around 590million yuan had been invested in the Wuling Mountain range.
