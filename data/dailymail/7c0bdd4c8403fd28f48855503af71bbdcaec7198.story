He spun on his heels and punched the air, yelping with glee as the frenzy ended. Neil Warnock has never been one to hide his feelings and, as he began digesting an eye-catching scoreline, he was at his most colourful.

A Crystal Palace victory over Everton had not been expected but there was nothing fortuitous about a 3-2 win, built on hard work and ruthlessness, which handed Warnock his first success since being re-appointed to the managerial hot seat at Selhurst Park.

Man-of-the-Match –Yannick Bolaise

Though Roberto Martinez described Palace's statistics as 'spooky' – three efforts on target led to three goals – to say they were lucky would be grossly unfair; relentless in their running and committed in their approach, they took full advantage of Everton's miserable defending. 

From being in a position of strength thanks to Romelu Lukaku’s ninth minute opener, Everton fell asunder as, first, a penalty from Mile Jedinak, then a header from Frazier Campbell and, finally, a smart finish from Yannick Bolaise – the game’s outstanding player – put Palace in command.

It left Warnock hopping gleefully on the touchline, oblivious to the howls of the home support, who were so vexed by Everton’s defending. 

Days such as these are why he always felt there was one more job for him before retirement.

‘I thought we deserved to win it, I really did,’ said Warnock. ‘In the first 20 minutes we probably gave them a bit too much respect. 

'But from then, we grew into the game and at half-time we said we should go and try and win it.’

Such an outcome looked improbable when Phil Jagielka popped a ball forward to Leon Osman in the ninth minute; he fed Lukaku and the Belgium international finished smartly. 

Had Osman then take a chance to double Everton’s lead in the 29 minutes, it would have been a long way back for Palace.

But Palace hung in and Everton’s downfall started in the next attack, when John Stones and Tim Howard made a hash of trying to thwart James McArthur. 

Instead of clearing their lines, McArthur scampered on to a loose ball but was chopped down by Howard.

Referee Michael Oliver had no hesitation pointing to the penalty spot. Jedinak did the rest, smashing in his kick from 12 yards – two goalkeepers would not have saved it; Palace might have led at the break but Bolaise struck a post via a deflection from Stones.

No matter. in the 54th minute when Martin Kelly bombed forward and hoisted in a cross to the back post that looked set to be comfortably gathered by Howard but, instead, he dropped the ball and presented Campbell with a simple header.

Frustration swirled around Goodison and worse was to follow when Osman dithered, allowing Puncheon to pick his pocket and the winger fed Bolaise, who kept his calm and rolled a right-foot finish under Howard’s flailing dive. Baines’ penalty was just a consolation.

‘Team like us can go and give a good account of themselves,’ said Warnock. 

‘Look at (the results of) Leicester and West Brom. I just feel it is wide open. But this just gives everyone a lift, doesn’t it? 

'We had to make headers and blocks at the end. But I like that kind of football.’

And he certainly wasn’t afraid to show it.
