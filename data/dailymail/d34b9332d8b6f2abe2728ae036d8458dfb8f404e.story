A man faces court for allegedly flying  a drone over the Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace and several Premier League football grounds.

Nigel Wilson, 42, of Nottingham, has been summoned in relation to 17 breaches of the Air Navigation Order, Scotland Yard said today.

Among venues over which he is said to have flown a 'small unmanned surveillance aircraft' are Liverpool's Anfield, the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal's home ground and Manchester City's Etihad Stadium.

Footage: Nigel Wilson, 42, of Nottingham, has been summoned in relation to 17 breaches of the Air Navigation Order, including over the Emirates Stadium (pictured)

Flight: Wilson is also accused of flying near the Palace of Westminster (pictured) and having failed to maintain direct, unaided and visual contact with a drone

He is also alleged to have failed to maintain direct, unaided and visual contact with a drone at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster.

A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said: 'We can confirm that we have assisted the police in preparing this prosecution.

'There are clear rules and regulations in place regarding the flying of drones in the UK and it is the responsibility of users to spend time fully understanding what those rules are.'

He will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday, April 16. 

The Civil Aviation Authority has previously issued a warning over the use of drones after footage was posted online. 

Summons: Wilson will appear in court next month for flying across central London, pictured

A CAA spokesman said: 'The rule is that you're not allowed to fly over large gatherings of people of 1,000 or more at any height.

'You're not allowed to go within 50 metres of a building or structure. It's not something that people can just do without permission for safety reasons.

'These [drones] can weigh up to seven or eight kilograms. They could create a bit of damage if they fall from 1,000 feet.'

The CAA has already prosecuted two people over illegal drone flying.
