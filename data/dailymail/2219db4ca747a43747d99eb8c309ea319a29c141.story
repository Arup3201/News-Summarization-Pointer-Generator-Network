Many a woman on the online dating scene will have arranged a date with a man who claimed to be 6ft tall - only to find him somewhat shorter in reality.

But according to new research the man was right to exaggerate his height - because the woman wouldn't have looked twice at his profile otherwise.

New data from online dating website AYI.com has found size really does matter when it comes to a woman's search for Mr Right.

The long and short of it: Women prefer taller men, as illustrated by petite 5ft 1in actress Hayden Panettiere who is engaged to 6ft 6in boxer Wladimir Klitschko

Researchers analysed more than 80,000 interactions between users of the dating website in the UK.

They found that every inch increase in a man's height directly correlated to his likelihood of being contacted by a woman. 

Taller men were significantly more likely to be contacted by women than shorter men.

Their data revealed that the ideal height women seek in a man is 6ft. The 6ft men who were members of the site were 33 per cent more likely to be contacted than a man of average height (5ft 7), and 77 per cent more likely to be contacted than a man under 5ft 4. 

But there is a limit to this height preference as women tend to shy away from men that are too tall. A man who is 6ft 4 or taller is 24 per cent less likely to be contacted by a woman.

The statistics reveal how women will measure up a man based on his online profile before arranging to meet - and if they're too short they won't stand a chance.

It might seem like a superficial aspect of online dating but it seems the same is also true in the real world.

Earlier this year, British and Dutch researchers studied more than 12,000 couples in the UK to compile data specifically on their height differences. The study found that in 92.5 per cent of couples, the man was taller.

Susan Krauss Whitbourne explains the appeal of taller men in Psychology Today.

She writes: 'There's just something appealing about tall men. Napoleon aside, tall men are more likely to win the popular contest in presidential votes and to be re-elected once in office. Their greater leadership potential may have something to do with the fact that tall men have higher self-esteem (whether or not deserved), are happier, and less likely to feel jealous toward other men. 

'When it comes to romantic partners, men and women tend to sort themselves out so that they form pairs of similar height. However, among married couples, women are more likely to be shorter than their husbands, if only by a few inches.'

When it comes to romance, she said tall men are more attractive because: 'Evolutionarily speaking, one might argue that a tall man would be preferred by women because, if you follow the argument, he'll be stronger and better able to ward off physical treats to his family.'

She adds that while this is no longer relevant today when we're not looking for man to go out and hunt wild animals for us, women are now 'conditioned by media images' of the ideal man to seek taller men.

The study by Dutch researchers found that women were most satisfied when they were much shorter than their male partners by about 7-8 inches. Perhaps this is why the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are a match made in heaven - Prince William is 7 inches taller than Kate.
