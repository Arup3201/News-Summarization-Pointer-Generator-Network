If this technology firm's office is anything to go by, workplaces of the future will be cleaner and greener.

Decos’ headquarters in the Netherlands looks like something from a sci-fi film and is entirely paperless - even down to the toilets.

Energy is supplied by nearby wind farms, its fleet consists of dozens of electric vehicles and employees use apps and 'shower toilets'. 

The office (pictured) was built for Noordwijk-based technology firm Decos by Inbo Architects. Decos said it is so committed to environmentally sustainability it has removed all paper from its office - even toilet roll

The building was designed by Inbo Architects.

Decos said it is so committed to environmentally sustainability that it has removed all paper from its office.

The minutes for meetings are taken and organised using Decos’ own Minute app, available for free from the Apple app store.

Shower toilets are a cross between a traditional toilet and a bidet.

They are fitted with an integrated nozzle in the basin of a traditional-looking toilet. 

The shower function is started by pressing a button on the side of the basin. 

The nozzle extends and sprays warm water.

A dryer function is then used to remove the water.

Decos has installed Aqua Clean shower toilets from German-based Gerberit.

All contracts are signed using e-signatures and documents are never printed.

Business cards are banned, and any post is returned as Decos demands only digital communication.

Even toilet paper and tissues are forbidden.

Instead, its 60 employees use Geberit Aqua Clean ‘shower toilets’.

Energy for the building is supplied using a nearby wind turbine park, and all new company cars are electric or hybrid.

The building covers 29,900 square feet (2,500 square metres) and cost €2.84 million (£2.2 million) to complete.

Its futuristic design was inspired by Star Wars (a sandcrawler is pictured), and is said to have been designed to resemble a 'meteorite in an alien moon landscape'

The company’s paperless commitment means it saves more than 16 trees per year – equivalent to a tonne of paper. The company is now turning its attention to building robots, developing machine learning products, and launching new collaboration tools to help other companies digitalise and go paperless

‘The building is designed as a meteorite in an alien moon landscape, as a symbol for our creativity and innovative strength,’ said the firm.

‘[It has] slanting walls, because we do not need cabinets. We work at flex-stations in open office gardens with glass partitions.’

‘We don’t miss paper at all,’ Minute managing director Roel Noort said.

‘Not only have we implemented technology services that replace all need for paper, but, in doing so, we’ve actually increased the efficiency, organisation, and sustainability of our company.’
