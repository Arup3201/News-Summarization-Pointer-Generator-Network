The 101st Tour de France begins in Yorkshire on Saturday with Britain's Chris Froome aiming to defend the winner's yellow jersey he claimed last year.

Froome became only the second Brit - after Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 - to win the Tour, and he did so in it's 100th edition.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at this year's Tour de France and tells you everything you need to know about the biggest cycling race in the world.

Geared up: Yorkshire will host the Grand Depart of the Tour de France on Saturday

Ready: Sky employees from Leeds unveil the world's biggest jersey ahead of the 2014 Tour de France

Brits on show

There are some notable British riders who will not be riding the Tour de France this year due to injury, illness or non-selection:

Four Brits will line-up in Leeds on Saturday as the 101st edition of the Tour begins.

Chris Froome (Team Sky)

'Froome-dog' is the pre-race favourite to defend the leader's yellow jersey he won last year.

The 29-year-old's versatility on the climbs and in time-trial stages should give him a great chance of winning but, although he won the Tour de Romandie for the second consecutive year, he has suffered from injuries and illness recently that could harm his chances.

Mark Cavendish (Omega Pharma-Quick Step)

The Manx Missile will be looking to gather as many stage wins as possible as he goes in search of a second green points jersey (he previously won it back in 2011).

Cavendish, 29, has already claimed 25 individual stage wins on the Tour and he will hope to add to that on Saturday.

Geraint Thomas (Team Sky)

The 28-year-old Welshman has raced on both the track and the road but he will be expected to work hard to try and deliver Froome to a second successive Tour win.

Simon Yates (Orica-GreenEdge)

A surprise selection ahead of his twin brother Adam, 21-year-old Yates will make his Tour debut hoping to push Orica-GreenEdge towards stage victories.

Favourite: Team Sky's British rider Chris Froome has a great chance of retaining his yellow jersey

Ready: Mark Cavendish has been cycling the route of Saturday's Grand Depart of the Tour de France

Brit: Geraint Thomas will ride the Tour for Team Sky, hoping to lead Chris Froome to overall victory

Debut: Simon Yates was a surprise inclusion for this year's Tour de France so will hope to impress

Route

3,664km - Distance covered by riders

21 - Number of stages on the 2014 Tour (six mountain stages and one time trial)

3 - Stages to be held in England

4 - Number of countries that the Tour will visit (England, France, Belgium and Spain)

3.5billion - Worldwide TV viewers (in 190 different countries)

22 - Different teams (18 of which are UCI World Tour teams, four are wild-cards)

198 - Riders taking part in the Tour

The Tour starts on Saturday and lasts until July 27. It comprises 21 stages and covers 3,664km in total.

Stages one to three will take place in England. The Tour begins with a 190km stage between Leeds and Harrogate, then on day two it travels 201km between York and Sheffield, and on its third day in England the riders will cycle 155km from Cambridge to London.

Such is the wide scope of the Tour, this year's route will see the riders visit four countries in all: England, France, Belgium and Spain.

There are six mountain stages this year (of which five are summit finishes) and just one time trial (54km race during stage 20).

Why does the Tour de France start in England?

Areas have to bid for the right to host stages of the Tour and, essentially, whichever proposals are the best financially and practically will be awarded with stages.

The majority of the Tour still takes place in France but stages are hosted elsewhere due to the prestige of the event itself and the tourism it can attract to areas such as Yorkshire.

This is the fourth Tour de France to contain stages in England after the 1974, 1994 and 2007 editions.

Bid: Areas have to put forward proposals to host stages and Britain have three in 2014

Streets: Team Sky practise on the cobbled roads of Yorkshire ahead of the Tour

Jerseys

Why are riders competing for different jerseys?

Each colour jersey rewards different types of cyclists.

The best rider in each of those categories is given the right to wear that jersey while riding the Tour and the jerseys are awarded individually at the end of each stage.

What are the different jerseys?

Leader: The yellow jersey is awarded to the rider who has the lowest time in the general classification

Yellow - The maillot jaune is awarded to the rider who is leading the general classification - has the quickest overall time so far in the race - and is the most prestigious of all the jerseys.

Green - This is awarded to the rider who is the most consistent finisher, which tends to mean it favours the sprinters due to it being more heavily weighted towards flat stages. The winner on a sprint stage collects 45 points, a medium mountain stage 30 points, and on high mountains or individual time trial stages just 20 points. Points are also awarded at intermediate sprints during stages (20 points for first place down to one point for the 15th rider).

Polka dot - This is awarded to the best climber. Points are gained by reaching the tops of hills or mountains first, with steeper hills rewarded with a greater number of points. Points are awarded on a sliding scale like with the green jersey.

White - This is awarded to the best placed rider aged 25 or under in the general classification.

Team Sky

Cycling can appear to be a very individual sport what with one person seemingly claiming over-all victory, but nothing could be further from the case. The plaudits go to the winner but it takes a real team effort for Froome or Bradley Wiggins to get to a position where they can win a Grand Tour.

There are 22 teams in the Tour de France, 18 of which are UCI WorldTour teams (they compete in a race circuit all around the world) and there are also four wild-cards (who are allowed entry to the Tour without competing on the rest of the circuit).

Each team comprises nine riders, meaning 198 cyclists will line-up in Leeds on Saturday

What are team leaders?

A team leader is the person most likely to win the Tour, or to claim stage victories.

Each team has a designated team leader who, in the case of Team Sky, is defending champion Chris Froome. He will wear the number one on his jersey as the defending champion.

What are domestiques?

Froome's team-mates will wear numbers two through nine and they will be his 'domestiques'.

A domestique is a support rider who cycles for his team leader. They effectively do the donkey work to deliver stage victories or to protect their lead riders.

In Team Sky, Britain's Geraint Thomas will act as one of Froome's domestiques and will be expected to protect and shield his leader. Alongside Thomas, Bernhard Eisel, Vasil Kiryienka, David Lopez, Mikel Nieve, Danny Pate, Xabier Zandio and Richie Porte will also look to help Froome to glory.

If Froome was to succumb to injury or misfortune then Porte would likely move up to team leader.

Cavendish also has domestiques, but they will look to deliver him to the final sprint of the stages he is targeting winning before letting the Manxman do the rest.

Together as one: Teams play a vital role in the Tour and it is not at all an individual event

Prize money

If the overall race leader needs to take a toilet break then the peleton will slow to allow him to catch-up.

The yellow jersey holder entering into the final stage will be allowed by other riders to win the race as long as he can complete the last stage unscathed.

The peloton will often slow to allow riders involved in a crash, or who have been the subject of sabotage, to catch up.

Overall winner of the Tour

£357,000 (usually split between the nine riders in a team - it is a Tour tradition that the overall winner will share the pot with his team-mates).

Individual stage winners

£20,000.

Green jersey winner

£20,000.

Polka dot jersey winner

£20,000.

Best young rider winner

£20,000.

What role do sponsors play?

Most team names - for example Team Sky - are based around a sponsor's branding due to the huge investment.

Often riders who win stages will point to their sponsors in order to give them prominence on TV or in photographs.

On show: The brands of the chief sponsors are emblazoned on the jerseys of the riders

Terminology

Peloton

The peloton is the main bunch of riders on a given stage.

Riders tend to conserve energy by bundling close together and taking it in turns to lead the pack.

Drafting

Drafting or slipstreaming is where riders will try and form a line directly behind one another in order to benefit from the slipstream in front and to conserve energy.

Team-mates may take turns in leading a group because of this, or a rider may attempt to follow a rival closely to also benefit from this.

Breaks

A 'break' is when one or more riders have split from the main peloton and opened out a lead on the main pack.

Grand Depart

The 'Grand Depart' is the first stage of the Tour.

Time Trials

An individual time trial is where a cyclist will race against clock by themselves around a stage.

There is only one time trial on this year's Tour - a 54km road time trial during Stage 20.

The riders will set off intermittently in order of their positioning in the general classification times.

Rest days

There will be two rest days on the Tour which are days when there is no cycling at all.

The first will take place on July 15 after the 10th stage, and the second will take place on July 21 after the 15th stage.

Grouped: The peloton is the main bunch of riders throughout a stage of a race

Climbs

Climbs in the Tour de France are ranked depending on their difficulty and steepness of their gradient.

Category One climbs tend to be the hardest, with Category Four the easiest, although 'hors categorie' climbs are even more difficult than category ones.

Difficulty: The gradient of a climb determines which 'category' it is
