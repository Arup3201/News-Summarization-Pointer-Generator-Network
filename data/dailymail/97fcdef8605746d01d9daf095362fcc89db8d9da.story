Hazmat teams in Halifax, Canada responded to a suspected radioactive leak at the Fairview Cove Container Terminal on Thursday evening.

According to emergency crews four cylinders containing uranium hexafluoride fell from a container and unconfirmed reports said radiation spiked to three times the safe level.

Halifax fire-fighters cleared workers from the ship and established three zones â€” a cold zone, a warm zone where a command post had been established and a hot zone near to the container where only the hazmat team was allowed.

'We have a leak, Iâ€™ve got to go,' said Halifax Fire and Emergency Service Division Commander Corey Beals said during an telephone interview with the Chronicle Herald in Halifax.

'A container fell and it could possibly have some type of nuclear material in it,' Beals said to the newspaper about the incident which occurred at 9.45pm EST.

'We have a hazmat team on scene right now and we have meters and equipment to go and meter the area to determine whether we do in fact have a leak or to rule it out.'

The wife of one worker at the terminal tweeted late on Thursday night that her husband was there when the container fell and that he was quarantined.

Halifax Fire Department confirmed later that four cylinders containing uranium hexafluoride did fall from a container, but there was no leak of radioactive material.

The fire department also said there had been no injuries or contamination as a result of the incident.

The container was being moved onto the deck of the Swedish-built Atlantic Companion when it dropped.

Uranium hexafluoride is used to provide fuel for nuclear power and in nuclear weapons and thousands of tonnes of uranium hexafluoride are annually shipped across the world.

Uranium hexafluoride that comes into contact with water or moisture in the air can form a lethal toxic cloud.
