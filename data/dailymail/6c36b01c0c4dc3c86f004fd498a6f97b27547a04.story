The key to the Duchess of Cambridge looking so radiant may in part be to do with her keeping herself looking fresh.

In attending her third event of the day, the 800m freestyle where she cheered Becky Adlington on to her second bronze medal of the Games, Kate had swapped her casual Team GB attire for a polka dot top underneath a smart and sharp red blazer.

The changing of outfits may lead many to question whether there may be a 'Royal locker room' somewhere in and around the Olympic venues.

Kate was in the passionate crowds at the Aquatics Centre tonight who witnessed Becky Adlington follow-up her bronze in the 400m freestyle with a medal of the same substance in the 800m equivalent.

After their rare show of affection last night watching Chris Hoy and the sprint team take home gold, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge seemed inseparable.

Prince William, in an interview with BBC's Sue Barker, later revealed that he was praying he wouldn't get caught on the 'kiss cam' even going as far as saying it would be 'rather embarrassing'.

But it seemed that Kate has gotten so into the Olympic fever that she is competing against her husband for the title of Team GB's top supporter after she was spotted back at the Olympic Park less than twenty four hours later, but this time without her husband.

Kate took to the balcony to cheer on the British hockey team who were playing Pakistan at the Riverbank Arena this evening, but William wasn't too far behind, being interviewed on the BBC sofa at the nearby Media Centre by presenter Sue Barker.

Beaming: The Princes were understandably delighted with their Royal relation Zara Phillips' gold medal in the equestrian eventing

Princes William and Harry, along with the Duchess of Cambridge, have been spotted in crowds at various Olympic events since the start of the Games, rarely holding back in their cheering of Team GB.

The trio were on their feet roaring Sir Chris Hoy to his fifth gold medal at the velodrome.

Today, William said seeing cousin Zara Phillips win a silver medal in the equestrian eventing was 'absolutely fantastic'.

'Emotionally I got completely carried away in the moment.

'We both missed her European and World Championships when she was there, we were always supporting her from the television so to actually be there when she got a medal and they’ve done so well as a team, and to see Team GB do brilliant so early on in the Olympics, I had goose-bumps on the back of my neck and I got far too carried away.'

Harry said she had been working 'so hard' to get to where she had got to, adding: 'We as cousins are very, very proud, it now explains why we never get to see her because she is always riding.'

Asked what their favourite moments were, William said Phillips’ medal was the most emotional and most involved for him because of the personal connection.

But he also paid tribute to the 'unsung stars' who have had their 'massive moment', such as Etienne Stott and Tim Baillie, who took gold in the canoe slalom yesterday.

'That was absolutely fantastic, we were glued to the television yesterday watching that.

The noise was incredible, seeing them jump into the water and swim around with the team I think was such a release for them.'

He went on: 'I think the velodrome last night with Sir Chris Hoy, that was absolutely fantastic, the world records being beaten and the atmosphere in there was electric.

'Every time they went round the other side of the audience roared louder than the other side.'

Harry confessed last night was the first time he has been part of a 'slow motion Mexican wave' and the pictures were 'absolutely hysterical'.

William added: 'If there’s things that come out of the Olympics that really last for the legacy of the future, things like where the girls have done really, really well and really branched out hopefully the young will follow and we can have more successes.'

Prince Harry said: 'This Olympics more than any other I think is huge inspirationally for the next generation and the generations beyond as well.

'It’s great to see, just looking out of this window now, the thousands of people strolling past, most people with kids.

'The Games should be a chance to get people out and for ourselves trying to encourage children to do the whole sporting activity thing rather than sitting in front of the TV and playing computer games is hugely important and having the Olympics in London is a fortunate stepping stone for that.'

As a keen hockey player at school, Kate watched avidly and showed her support as soon as the team scored their first goal.

Earlier on today the Duchess joined Prime Minister David Cameron and former 400m British Olympic champion Sally Gunnell to watch heptathlete Jessica Ennis set a new record in the 100m hurdles.

As
an ambassador for Team GB Kate's presence is a brilliant support for 
the team, and she followed up yesterday's patriotic wardrobe choice of a 
Team GB Union white polo shirt that she wore at last night's event, along with her trusty £145 pair of Givenchy sunglasses and trademark pearl earrings.

Kate was seen smiling and chatting to fellow supporters as they watched Jessica Ennis race towards victory.

Ennis, who has become synonymous with the glamour of the Olympics, won her race in 12.54 seconds - the fastest time ever recorded for the hurdles in the pentathlon.

It was the perfect start for the 26-year-old in front of a sell-out crowd at the 80,000-seater Olympic Stadium in Stratford.

Ennis, from Sheffield, will also be competing in the high jump, 
shot-put and 200m heats today. The gruelling seven-discipline event ends
with the javelin, long jump, and 800m on Saturday.

She is the current world silver medallist and world indoor champion who
unfortunately missed the Beijing Olympics because of injury.

This morning's event is just one of the many events that she is expected to attend on day 7 of the Games.

The
Duchess of Cambridge is clearly enjoying this summer's top sporting 
events and has become an avid fan of a range of sports from velodrome to
equestrian.

Since
the Games started on Saturday she and her husband have taken full advantage 
of their VIP invites and have already been guests of honour at
the equestrian events two days running.

The Royal family headed to Greenwich Park on Tuesday to cheer on the Queen's granddaughter Zara
Phillips as Team GB took home a silver medal in the Eventing Team 
Jumping final of the three-discipline Olympic equestrian eventing 
competition.

The Duchess of
Cambridge along with Princes William and Harry joined Princess Anne and
the Duchess of Cornwall to watch Zara compete.

Zara
Phillips and her team mates narrowly missed out on gold in the 
equestrian eventing today but spectators were still delighted.

Kate even found time to visit the 
athletes in the Olympic Village that afternoon where swimmer 
Rebecca Adlington gushed about her navy blue shoes.

After showing
her emotion at Murray's Wimbledon defeat earlier this year, Kate seemed
overjoyed to be returning to Centre Court to support the British 
favourite.

Kate and her 
husband William got into the supportive spirit quickly and joined in 
with another Mexican wave that ran through the crowd during the match.

There was no stopping the sports fanatic couple who, after
enthusiastically cheering on Andy Murray on the tennis courts of 
Wimbledon, zipped across town in 
time to see the British men's pursuit team smash the world record in 
their qualifying round and then go on to win gold in a breathtaking race.

No
doubt Kate and William took advantage of the Olympic lanes in the Capital reserved for VIPs, and style icon Kate even 
found time to change out of her Stella McCartney shift dress and in to a
sporty white polo shirt.
