While many believed that this season's title race was turning in to a procession for Jose Mourinho's unbeaten Chelsea, Manchester City's recent resurgence has set up an enthralling fight to the finish.

Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Tottenham  meant the Blues maintained a six-point lead at the top of the table but free-scoring performances against Southampton and Sunderland have seen Manuel Pellegrini's City stake their intentions.

KEOWN ON THE DEFENSIVE UNITS

Thibaut Courtois’ mistakes are minimal and it never seems to be his fault when Chelsea concede — I’m not sure you can say the same about Joe Hart. 

Terry and Cahill are formidable and Ivanovic and Azpilicueta solid. Kompany is terrific but, Zabaleta apart, the rest are inconsistent. 

But the key is the work done in front of them. Chelsea’s pressing and the screen Matic provides means it’s almost impossible to isolate their defenders. 

City on the other hand are too often left exposed.

REDKNAPP ON THE MIDFIELD BATTLE

When everybody is fit, there is very little to choose between these two midfields. Signing Fabregas was a statement of intent and he has given Chelsea subtlety and class.

They have lost Lampard’s goals but Fabregas’ assists make up for it. Hazard could get into any team in the world and Matic is a perfect shield.

City have struggled to find that balance but injuries have disrupted them. People called Yaya Toure useless and unfit, but he scores a few and all of a sudden he’s purring and David Silva, when he’s fit, is a genius.

REDKNAPP ON THE ATTACKING POWER

I said a few weeks ago the title race could be a shootout between Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa. Nothing has changed! 

Costa has adapted so quickly and he plays on the edge, but I like that. Didier Drogba is useful as Jose’s eyes in the dressing room and Loic Remy provides good back-up. 

Aguero is on fire and now he’s staying fit his scoring rate is incredible. 

Edin Dzeko is hit-and-miss and Stevan Jovetic has chipped in, but Aguero has carried City at times. 

A front two of Costa and Aguero would be the perfect partnership, but Aguero’s goals give City the slightest edge.
