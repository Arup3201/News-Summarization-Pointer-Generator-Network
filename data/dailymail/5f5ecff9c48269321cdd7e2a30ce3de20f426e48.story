England’s limited-overs future was looking a little brighter yesterday after Joe Root’s third one-day century of the year and another sprightly innings from James Taylor inspired them to a five-wicket win over Sri Lanka.

A target of 240 turned out to be not so much the small mountain some had feared as a pleasant stroll in the Pallekele hills. Tantalisingly, England now trail 3-2 with two games to play.

Just as important, the manner in which Root and Taylor — both nimble, inventive and busy — put on 104 in 21 overs for the third wicket lent weight to England’s repeated insistence that they really are capable of playing a modern brand of one-day cricket.

Root made an unbeaten 104 from 117 balls and Taylor 68 — four days after his morale-boosting 90 in Colombo — as England turned in their most complete 50-over performance since brushing aside the Sri Lankans in Manchester in May.

The result glossed over another patchy innings from Alastair Cook, who made 20 in 30 balls, but he could at least spend most of the post-match press conference answering questions about his two young team-mates rather than his own form.

‘Rooty played a knock of equal class to Sangakkara’s 91,’ said the England captain. ‘James has taken his chance and played so well on two difficult wickets. I was a little concerned about the pitch this morning, but it didn’t make a difference.’

Strictly speaking, of course, it wasn’t a one-day international at all, spread, as it was, across Wednesday and Thursday by the weather.

But that merely emphasised England’s superiority here: mean with the ball on day one, when Chris Woakes claimed six wickets, and clinical with the bat on day two.

Play resumed with the Sri Lankans hoping to strangle England with their phalanx of spinners. And it seemed to be working.

In the second over Moeen Ali charged at Sachithra Senanayake and was bowled for four. And it was 35 for two when Cook was trapped in front by Senanayake.

Recording his latest failure — and that’s 57 international innings now without a century — has assumed the air of a bloodsport. England have already declared him their World Cup captain of course, but pot-shots will continue to be taken until Cook successfully returns fire.

I keep getting 20s and 30s,’ he said. ‘That’s more frustrating to me than it is to anyone else.’

Conditions here bear little resemblance to what is expected at the World Cup but Taylor’s innings oozed the deftness and adroit game-management that will do well on any surface.

He scarpered the singles, swept with intent, and deposited Tillekeratne Dilshan’s off-spin over cow corner for six.

But, as at Colombo, a pair of sweat-soaked gloves appeared to bring about Taylor’s demise: an attempted pull off Thisara Perera provided a simple catch for Ajantha Mendis at long leg.

But Root was determined to see the job through. He and Ravi Bopara added an untroubled 86 and, though Bopara was caught with 15 needed, Root was soon celebrating his hundred with a crowd-silencing slog-sweep for six.

Eoin Morgan threw his wicket away attempting the winning hit, but if England can repeat this result here tomorrow, their reward will be an unexpected series decider in Colombo on Tuesday.

‘This was a really important win for us,’ said Cook. ‘Colombo hasn’t been kind to us so far, but we’ve won away from there. It would be great to get there at 3-3 and have a series final.’

That is not a sentence many were expecting Cook to be able to utter when this tour started.
