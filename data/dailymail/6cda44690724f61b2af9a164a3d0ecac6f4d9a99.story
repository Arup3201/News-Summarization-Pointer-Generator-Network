Best watch your back hipster London eateries; there's new kid on the block coming to take your crown.

Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known -  is set to open its doors in Soho this May.

The menu will offer a variety of sandwiches, from the classic grilled cheese which will set you back £4.50 to more upmarket fillings such as slow-cooked lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens.

The grilled cheese sandwich shop follows in the footsteps of the UK's other single-item restaurants – Porridge Cafe in Old Street, London; Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches, and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe.

The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts

The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses.

All combinations are served between hand-made, organic, sourdough bread from London's local Wapping bakery and use free-range Native Breeds meat from Gloucestershire.

Sides such as crisp pickles, relish, cheese-friendly sauces and cheese on toast popcorn will be available to 'heighten the experience'.

Melt Room will also serve luxury toasties such as this pulled lamb melt with mustard dressed greens

The cafe is the brainchild of self-confessed grilled cheese aficionado Andrey Datsenko who wanted to 'fix his own grilled cheese cravings.'

Mr Datsenko said: 'I spent the better part of my youth studying hospitality management in New York and very quickly became addicted to the delicious and hearty grilled cheese sandwiches the city had to offer.

'I am very excited to launch Melt Room, not only to fix my own grilled cheese cravings, but to offer Londoners a gourmet American-inspired version of this much loved snack.'

The menu includes the Classic – the holiest of grilled cheese sandwiches made with Keens sharp cheddar double slices; slow and low lamb shoulder with mustard dressed greens and melted Swiss, and rare roast beef coupled with Sparkenhoe red Leicestershire.

The shop will open from 7am for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with 12 seats available for guests to enjoy a quick meal accompanied by cheesy tunes.

And don't fret if you can't get yourself a seat – they're also introducing a local delivery service.

Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe

The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. 

Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings.

The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. 

Just crisps: Businessman Andrew McMenamin opened Belfast's Simply Crispy in January 2015

In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk.

The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world.

The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal.

The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London. 

Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his pop-up going for just four weeks.

But with diners queuing down the street to get their hands on the snacks, which have sold out every day, the cafe will now stay open and could even expand to other shops in Northern Ireland, Dublin, or London.

'We have managed to sell out every day - not the crisps though, the bread, the baps. We can't get our hands on enough fresh baps because everything flies out of the door,' Mr McMenamin said.

Moo’d, opened by best friends Zoe Blogg and Jen Gibb in Leeds in February this year, offers 100 different cereals as well as ‘cocktails’ consisting of mixed varieties of different brands.

Not wanting to be left behind, two rivals are racing to become Manchester's first cereal cafe. Black Milk Cereal Dive has confirmed it will open in Afflecks Palace this month, and according to Twitter, Cereal Central MCR is 'coming soon.'
