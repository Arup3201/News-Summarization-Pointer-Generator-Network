A minister who opened his church to Muslim worshippers told today how he has been hit by a barrage of abuse by internet users.

St John's Episcopal Church became the first church in the UK to share their building with Muslims after Rev Isaac Poobalan saw members of a neighbouring mosque praying outside in the snow because of a lack of space.

Hundred of Muslims now pray in the Aberdeen Church's main hall and chapel every week, but the news has not been well received by some, who have taken to the church's Facebook page to attack the decision.

Rev Poobalan, right, said he would not be true to his faith if he did not offer to help his neighbours with their overcrowding problem

One user said that the church was 'sharing Christ's table with Satan' before others another predicted a 'flood' of Muslims moving to Aberdeen to convert the church into a mosque and said Rev Poobalan needed to be given the 'boot' before it was too late.

Another posted: 'I would leave this so called "church". Allah is Satan, and no God. They (the church) have nothing to say about persecuted Christians, but invite Satan in.

'We are dealing with evil people that bow down to Allah and lost their belief in Jesus a long time ago. Allah has no son.'

The church's Facebook page was no longer available this afternoon.

But today Rev Poobalan said he would not sever his relationship with the nearby Crown Street Mosque.

He said: 'I keep seeing these Facebook comments coming up on my email account, but I will not back down. We have developed a relationship with the mosque and we will not be breaking that up.

'These people have reacted spontaneously, but over time I hope they will change their minds.

'There
is a huge religious cultural gap between the two, and if it takes time 
for them to be brought together then that's the way it is.

'With
our media culture these days one can easily make comments and respond 
to things instantaneously, you just have to live with it.'

One
user even criticised Rev Poobalan for being a Good Samaritan to just be
'liked' and said there was nothing 'courageous' in his actions.

Rev
Poobalan said: 'What governed my human response was the Christian 
teaching 'love your neighbour as yourself' and that was honestly my 
first thought, 'I have to help them as a neighbour'.

'Jesus Christ wasn't one who wanted to be liked and I don't expect people to like me or the Church for what we do. We don't go into this blindly, we go into this knowingly and we don't go around trying to please people.

'It was simply a gut feeling to let them in after seeing someone in the cold praying and I believe that prayer is never wrong. There is nothing wrong with making them comfortable.'

St John's Episcopal Church in Aberdeen is believed to be the first in the UK to share with Muslims

Sheikh
Ahmed Megharbi of the Syed Shah Mustafa Jame Masjid mosque said: 'What 
happens here is special and there should be no problem repeating this 
across the country.

'The relationship is friendly and respectful.'

St
John's is part of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the 
Anglican Communion and distinct from the presbyterian Church of 
Scotland.

The Bishop of 
Aberdeen and Orkney, the Right Rev Dr Robert Gillies said that this 
relationship could be the start of a change in dynamics between the two 
faiths.

Dr Gillies said: 'It would be good to think we can change the world. Most of us most of the time feel we can’t so don’t bother.

'But sometimes, someone has a vision we can do something of global significance on a local scale.

'This is what is happening between St John’s and the mosque in its grounds.

'Everyone can do something locally and if more were to do so then something big might just begin to happen globally.'

Sections of the church hall have been handed over to the mosque and the imam has led prayers in the chapel

Dr
Gillies said that the 'eyes of the world' were now focused on the two 
faiths represented in the building on the city’s Crown Terrace.

Although the Christian church regards Jesus as the son of God, the Muslim faith views him as a key prophet.

Even with differences like these, there can be a mutual respect, said Dr Gillies.

The relationship between the mosque and St John’s has developed over the past few years.

On Christmas Eve 2010 both opened their doors for prayers, food and socialising.

In 2011, the church and mosque teamed up to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA.

Verses were read from both the Bible and the Koran to commemorate those who died.

There have been cases of Christians allowing Muslims to pray in their churches in parts of America.

In 2011, two Florida churches were criticised for opening their doors to Muslim groups.

But Church leaders believe the move in Aberdeen is a first for the United Kingdom.
