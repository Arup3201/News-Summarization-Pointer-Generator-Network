Six seniors at a Long Island high school are under investigation and facing disciplinary action after posting a photo of them wearing t-shirts saying 'RAPE?'.

The students from Commack High School posed for the image next to the athletics track yesterday after their annual class picture and uploaded it to Twitter. 

It was then spotted by angry students online who then started to share the photo on social media.  

First image: The students from Commack High School posed for the image next to the athletics track after their annual class picture. It was then posted on Twitter and spotted by fellow students 

The first image shows five of the students in a line, with the word written in gold letters, followed by a question mark.

In the second image, the question mark is replaced with a period while another student joins the pose.

He is seen lying on the floor with his hands tied together and tape covering his mouth.

Student Danielle DiFrancisco told ABC News: 'When they showed me the picture, I thought 'this is ridiculous, I go to this school, and I've been here for three years. These kids are older than me - have some respect!'' says , 'It doesn't just affect them, it affects the whole school, too.'

Senior Ali Salam knows the students who posted the picture. He told the station: 'They were actually doing it off a book called The Fault in Our Stars - on the cover it says "OK" with a question mark, and then "OK" underneath it with a period.

Controversial: In the second image, the question mark is replaced with a period and another student is also seen lying on the ground with his hands and mouth tied up

'And that's what they're using to defend themselves, but it's still pretty wrong.'

In a statement, school administrators said the students 'showed an inexcusable lack of judgment,' and have now launched a 'comprehensive investigation to determine the full scope of this matter and whether or not this was an isolated incident.'

They added: 'We deeply regret the turmoil caused by the actions of these students and know that it does not reflect the values of the rest of Commack High School or the Commack community.' The students in the photo were reportedly in school on Friday.

The group's photos come in the wake of high-profile high school rape cases that have involved the use of Twitter. 

During the Steubenville Rape Case in 2012, the victim's attackers posted the images on social media.

Then, star football players Trent Mays, 16, and Ma’lik Richmond, 17, were found guilty of raping a drunk 16-year-old girl in a night of back to back house parties in August last year as a result. 

Investigation: Administrators at Commack High School in Long Island (pictrued) are considering disciplinary action against the students - who reportedly attended school on Friday
