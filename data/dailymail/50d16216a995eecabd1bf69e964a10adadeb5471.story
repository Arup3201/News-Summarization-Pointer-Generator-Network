Soft-boiled eggs are back on the menu for pregnant women, according to experts.

A study has found that stricter precautions taken by producers mean even babies can be safely fed runny egg, which it is claimed can stop them becoming allergic later on. 

NHS Choices still advises pregnant women to avoid soft-boiled eggs or give them to babies after weaning because of the salmonella risk.

Dr Juliet Gray, registered nutritionist and co-author of the review, said expectant mothers may be unwittingly putting their children at greater risk of allergy by an avoiding eggs 

Just nine per cent of babies are currently given eggs at six months, the recommended age to start weaning.

Even at 12 months, only one-third are given eggs, with allergy concerns given as the main reason for avoiding eggs, says a new review published in the Journal of Health Visiting.

Data from the latest UK Infant Feeding Study of more than 10,000 mothers also showed that three-quarters of new mums largely avoided eggs and more than one in ten did not feed their babies with boiled eggs.

But widespread vaccination of hens against the infection among producers taking part in the British Lion scheme has ‘effectively eliminated’ the bug from their eggs.

The British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) says the launch of a strict code of practice 15 years ago has been so successful that 90 per cent of British eggs are now laid by salmonella-vaccinated hens

The British Egg Industry Council (BEIC) says the launch of a strict code of practice 15 years ago has been so successful that 90 per cent of British eggs are now laid by salmonella-vaccinated hens.

Each egg is stamped with a lion mark and a best-before date on the shell.

Dr Juliet Gray, registered nutritionist and co-author of the review, said mothers may be unwittingly putting their children at greater risk of allergy by an avoidance strategy.

She said research suggests delayed introduction of potential food allergens, such as eggs, during weaning may actually be counterproductive.

In contrast the introduction of these foods while breastfeeding, between the ages of 4-7 months, could protect against developing allergies to these foods.

Dr Gray said two trials are being carried out to test whether the approach works and two government committees are also reviewing the current advice on infant feeding and food allergy.

She said ‘Eggs are highly nutritious, containing key nutrients including high quality protein, vitamin D, selenium, choline and omega-3 fatty acids, several of which are not found in many other foods.

‘Our review concluded that mums and their babies can be encouraged to eat eggs, as this could have a positive effect in terms of nutritional intake and may also help immune tolerance of eggs.

‘The BEIC advice that vulnerable groups can go back to runny eggs, if produced under the Lion scheme, should further reassure women that they can enjoy them normally in pregnancy and give them to their babies when weaning from six months.’

A nationwide salmonella scare in 1988 – sparked by Edwina Currie who was health minister at the time – resulted in vulnerable groups such as expectant mums, infants and the elderly being advised not to eat undercooked eggs.
