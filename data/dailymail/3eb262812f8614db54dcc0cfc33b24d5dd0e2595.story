He spoke out earlier this month to slam Simon Cowell allowing so many children and young wannabes to audition for Britain's Got Talent.

But the music mogul used Monday night's live semi final of his ITV1 show to take numerous swipes back at Bruce Forsyth for his comments.

Cowell seemed to believe he had proved why children SHOULD be allowed on his shows after some talented youngsters returned to impress the four judges.

Hitting back: Simon Cowell takes several digs at Bruce Forsyth during Monday night's live semi final of Britain's Got Talent after the Strictly Come Dancing Host complained about the number of children allowed to audition earlier this month

She's Got Talent: When 11-year-old Arisxandra came on stage to sing on Monday, Simon used the opportunity to dedicate it to Bruce after smugly showing off how talented she was

Jibes: Similarly when Essex dance troupe Youth Creation wowed the audience, Cowell couldn't wait to make a jibe at 'grumpy' Bruce for daring to say children shouldn't be allowed to audition

The show is a Saturday night must-see for millions of children.

But as far as Sir Bruce Forsyth is concerned, they should remain watching Britain’s Got Talent rather than taking part in it.

The 85-year-old TV veteran attacked Simon Cowell for allowing youngsters to take part in his ITV show claiming it is an ‘ordeal’ for many of them and results in many of them crying.

‘I don’t think that’s entertainment,’ he said. ‘I don’t think they should put children on that are too young.’

Sir Bruce, who plans to return as presenter of Strictly Come Dancing – the BBC’s rival to another Cowell show, The X Factor – in the autumn, added: ‘If you’re going to do that, have a separate show. Have a children’s show, British Children Have Talent.’

Although Simon has ignored Bruce's comments and used Monday night's live programme to smugly show off the youngsters on this year's series.

Lengthy tenure: Sir Bruce Forsyth has hosted Strictly Come Dancing for 10 years since its inception

When Essex dance troupe Youth Creation returned on stage Simon couldn't wait to take a dig at Forsyth.

Branding the TV veteran Mr Grumpy he said: 'Someone, Mr Grumpy, said we shouldn't have children your age on the show so what do you think yes or no you should be here?'

The dancers of course screamed yes in unison as they happily got sent on their way with four thumbs up from Simon, David Walliams, Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden.

Couldn't decide: The judges couldn't agree on whether to send through Youth Creation or Arisxandra so it was sent it to the public vote

Overcome: 11-year-old Arisxandra became the second act to go through as the judges took their decision to the public vote

Stars in the making: While the rest of contestants were sent home, the two most popular will go through

But Simon took another chance to make a more obvious dig at Bruce later in the show when it was 11-year-old singer Arisxandra's turn to have another audition.

The young singer wowed the crowd and judges, even receiving a standing ovation for her talents as she belted out a risky Whitney Houston number.

And Cowell made a jibe as soon as he could: 'I think it was one of the best performances of the night and I'd like to dedicate this one to Bruce.'

Tough job: After the opening act, the judges looked a little hesitant about what was to come

Dance troupe: Youngsters Youth Creation looked very vibrant in their multi-coloured stage attire

Earlier this month Safer Media, a charity that campaigns for family-friendly media, backed Sir Bruce and called for a ban on children under 16 taking part in TV talent shows.

The criticisms emerged as one particular installment of the show saw several acts made up of children – some as young as five. Many were in tears at the end as the pressure of being judged became too much.

One young girl in dance troupe Pre-Skool, comprising 13 five to eight-year-olds, started to cry as she waited for the judges to decide whether they would go through to the next round.

Emotive performance: 11-year-old Arisxandra silenced the crowd as she started singing

Blown away: Simon admitted that he adored the youngster's performance, singling her out as a frontrunner

Confident performance: Despite her young age, the star in he making had amazing stage presence

Youth Creation, 33 children aged between seven and 14 from Essex also took part, with many of them becoming emotional at the end.

Irish teenagers Jack Duff, 13, and Cormac Connell, 14, gave an impressive rendition of Of Monsters and Men’s hit Little Talks but also appeared on the verge of breaking down as they waited for the panel’s verdict.

Even Cowell acknowledged their 
performance was good but not great because nerves had got the better of 
them on the show, which topped TV ratings, attracting more
than ten million viewers – three million more than BBC rival The 
Voice.

‘People are so careful about using 
animals in entertainment and we want to be even more careful about what 
we expose children to.’

Scenes of children breaking down in 
tears have become all too common on BGT, with Sir Bruce recalling how 
one girl of 11 was left in tears.

A spokesman for the show said: 'The 
welfare of all contestants is our number one priority and we have 
stringent procedures in place relating to children who appear in our 
programmes.

'Children are accompanied by a member
of their family or a guardian at all times and a psychologist is on 
hand at all auditions.

'We also employ registered chaperones at our judges’ audition days and live shows to monitor the children’s welfare.

'As there are a limited number of performances Britain’s Got Talent does not have an age limit.'

Feeling the pressure: Dance troupe Pre-Skool looked nervous

Hundreds of viewers complained in 
2009 when two child singers, Hollie Steel and Natalie Okri, cried due to
the pressure of performing live.

And last year Britain’s Got Talent 
had to defend its lack of an age limit when nine-year-old Malaki Paul 
broke down in tears after struggling to finish his song because of 
nerves.

Last month child welfare campaigners 
questioned whether five-year-old Jordan Nash should have been put 
through to the next round. While the youngster, from London, received 
positive comments from the judges, there were concerns that he is too 
young to cope with fame, should he progress to the final stages of the 
competition.

Jordan, dressed in a black baseball 
cap and a T-shirt with his name on it, performed an impressive dance 
routine and was given a ‘Yes’ by all four judges.

But viewers called the decision ‘inappropriate’ and called on ITV to bring in new rules to ‘stop this happening’.
