Morgan Schneiderlin's international future may be tied up by being named in the France World Cup squad.

The Southampton midfielder, 24, is eligible for England and had previously admitted he would consider a call-up from Roy Hodgson.

But French paper L'Equipe reports Schneiderlin may be called up to Didier Deschamps' provisional squad for next month's tournament in Brazil.

Choices: Didier Deschamps is naming his provisional 30-man France World Cup squad next week

Schneiderlin was born in Alsace and played for France at every youth level from Under 16 to Under 21 and captained them at U19s, but has yet to earn a cap for the senior team.

That could change when Deschamps names his squad on Tuesday. Schneiderlin has one last chance to impress when Southampton host Manchester United on Sunday, the final match of the Premier League season.

Speaking in March, Schneiderlin was open to playing for England, saying: 'The France manager makes his choice and he has his team. He has a group of 30 players that he trusts and will take [to the World Cup] and I'm not part of that.

'I left France very young and maybe because I played in the second division they lost me a bit and prefer other players who play in France. That's not up to me, it's people's tastes. I just do my best.

'More opportunities are given in England. In England if you have two months of playing very well you're ready and on the list to play for England but that's not the case in France.'
