Shamed commentators Andy Gray and Richard Keys are embroiled in yet another sexism row after video emerged of the two men making lewd comments to a female colleague.

The presenters were sacked by Sky Sports following a series of allegedly misogynistic incidents, including mocking a woman linesman and making crude jokes on camera.

The newly unearthed clip shows the pair wolf-whistling at Sky's Clare Tomlinson, before shouting: 'Get off the pitch!'

Mr Gray and Mr Keys then launched into a chant of 'Get your t**s out for the lads!' as their colleague waiting to begin recording.

Inappropriate: Clare Tomlinson was about to appear on camera when the pair spoke to her

The emergence of the decade-old video 
will come as a particular blow to Mr Gray, who last week returned to 
mainstream television for the first time in three years.

He
 commentated on an FA Cup match for BT Sport, and may have been hoping 
for longer-term deal with the channel - but the latest incident puts his
 return at risk.

A 
spokesman for BT Sport said the channel was 'happy with his commentary' 
but refused to confirm whether or not the channel would employ him again
 in future.

The 30-second 
clip, published by The Football Ramble, was filmed at the Millennium 
Stadium in Cardiff in the early 2000s, during the filming of footage for
 Sky Sports.

Wrong: Keys and Gray were caught singing: 'Get your t**s out for the lads'

Presenter: Ms Tomlinson, the butt of the comments, is a regular anchor on Sky Sports News

The two commentators left Sky in January 2011
 after they were heard on air making derogatory remarks about 
female assistant referee Sian Massey prior to a Premier League 
match.

Believing
 their microphones were off, Mr Gray said: ‘Can you believe that? A female 
linesman. Women don’t know the offside rule.’ Mr Keys replied: ‘Course they
 don’t.’

oth were banned before further footage emerged of Mr Gray making 
an inappropriate comment to Sky Sports presenter Charlotte Jackson off
 air at the Sky studios.

Mr Gray’s
 contract was immediately terminated by Sky Sports for 'unacceptable behaviour', while Keys resigned soon 
after.

Controversial: Gray was caught on tape with Sky Sports colleague Andy Burton discussing female official Sian Massey before a match at Molineux

Target: Official Sian Massey was the woman that Gray had aimed his insults at

More videos were 
leaked around the time of the Massey incident, including one of the two 
men giggling while watching highlights of the 1998 Women’s FA Cup 
final, and another of Mr Keys making lewd jokes about an ex-girlfriend 
of co-presenter Jamie Redknapp.

Both were later 
involved in a stage show called Smash It!, designed for the corporate 
hospitality circuit, named after Mr Keys's comments.

After
 a brief absence, the pair re-appeared as joint hosts of a talk show on
 radio station talkSPORT, before continuing their TV careers with Al 
Jazeera’s beIN Sports in the Middle East.

Inexcusable: Gray made a lewd suggestion to Charlotte Jackson as they prepared for a Sky Sports show

A
 source last night confirmed that the video is genuine and it is 
believed to have come from a Sky outside broadcast from the Millennium 
Stadium.

Sky are unlikely to take the 
matter further because both men have since left the company.

Mr Gray,
 58, will see the leak of this new video as a deliberate attempt to 
sabotage his bid to make a return to TV screens in this country.
