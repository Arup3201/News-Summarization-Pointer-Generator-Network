Samuel Eto'o could still return to west London as Queens Park Rangers prepare to hold talks with the striker’s agent.

The former Chelsea frontman is a free agent after his deal at Stamford Bridge ran out.

And Harry Redknapp has identified him as an option to lead the line for his newly promoted side - but Eto’o’s £3million-a-year wage demands provide a major stumbling block for any deal.
