Australia's incoming Defence chief has unwittingly been drawn in to an internet fraud scam, with his identity being used to con women out of money.

Police have confirmed a fake Facebook account in the name of Air Marshal Mark Binskin was set up and the fraudster contacted his latest victim last month.

Unknown to Air Marshal Binskin, who becomes Defence chief on July 3, a German woman called Anna Linden, 54, was messaged on Facebook with declarations of love.

The new Australian Defence Force, Air Marshal Mark Binkskin had his identity stolen to con women out of money with declarations of love

Messages including 'I really love you' and 'I promise you my life' were followed up with requests for money loans.

Air Marshal Binskin's unknown impersonator asked Ms Linden if she could pay for a plane ticket to Spain which cost $403 as he was stuck in London without a valid visa, reported the Sun Herald.

The imitator then told her that she would 'never regret' the decision as he planned on repaying her by selling his 5kg of gold.

However this is not an isolated case as Ms Linden believes other women in Germany and two others from different countries were also contacted by the same impersonator.

New Zealand has also been hit with a similar incident after they recently discovered a fake account claiming to be former defence chief Rhys Jones, whose identity was also stolen in 2012.

'This was referred to the New Zealand police and also to Facebook as a violation,' a New Zealand Defence Force spokeswoman said.

'This case in 2014 appears to be a new impersonation page and the New Zealand Defence Force will be taking similar action.'

The Australian Federal Police confirmed to MailOnline that they were aware of the Facebook page but the Department of Defence was taking the lead on the matter.

The Australian Defence Force did not respond to MailOnline's inquiries.

Neither the Australian nor the New Zealand defence forces clarified whether the incidents are linked.

There have also been reports that Facebook suspended other profiles on Thursday which included accounts claiming to be top US and European military commanders along with a fake account of American astronaut Mark Kelly.

Defence Chief General David Hurley will hand over to Air Marshal Binskin, who is married to wife Gitte and has two sons, next month.
