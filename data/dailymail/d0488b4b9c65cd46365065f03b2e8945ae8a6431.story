Nick Clegg is facing a mutiny from his own party after supporting David Cameron’s decision to wield the veto.

The Deputy Prime Minister backed the Prime Minister’s negotiating position after being telephoned by him in the early hours of yesterday to discuss the unfolding events.

But Mr Clegg apparently believed the veto would not be necessary, as France and Germany would roll over and make concessions to Britain to maintain treaty change at the level of all 27 EU countries.

The failure of the deal and use of the veto has left the overwhelmingly pro-EU Lib Dems close to a state of crisis – with senior ministers said to be ‘deeply concerned’.

They fear the Coalition will be put under unprecedented strain and sources warned that any Tory moves to loosen ties with the EU further would lead to open revolt among the Lib Dem membership.

Former party leader Lord Ashdown said: ‘There will be a huge price to pay and, as a consequence, the foreign policy priorities of this country for the past 40 years has gone down the plughole in a single night.

'That foreign policy has now been hijacked by the Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party aided by a Prime Minister who was not prepared to stand up for the national interest.’

He told the Guardian: ‘As a consequence 
we have lost control of the European agenda and the Prime Minister has 
lost control of the demands for a referendum. This has been Gallic 
payback time for the way in which Cameron went around Europe lecturing 
Sarkozy on what to do.’

Prominent Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott, a close political ally of the Business Secretary Vince Cable, described the summit outcome as ‘a black day for Britain and Europe’.

He said: ‘We are now in the waiting room while critical decisions are being taken. With the western economies and our banking system on the edge of a cliff, we should not be putting special pleading for special interests in the City of London above our vital national interest of working closely together with Germany and France to keep our economy and jobs all over Britain safe.’

Lorely Burt, chairman of the Lib Dem parliamentary party, said it was unclear why Mr Clegg had agreed to the decision.

She said: ‘I gather Cameron phoned our illustrious leader before he decided to do this. There must have been reasons. I don’t see them at the moment.’

Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said the UK 
was facing a ‘worst-case scenario’ of isolation in Europe. Mr Horwood 
said the result was not the ‘ideal outcome from a Lib Dem point of 
view’.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused David Cameron of leaving Britain 'on the sidelines of Europe'

Furious: Mr Miliband, a staunch pro-European, said Mr Cameron caved into the demands of Tory Eurosceptics

But he blamed Tory Eurosceptics for pushing the Prime Minister into a corner. He added: ‘It will make it more difficult for us to exercise the kind of influence that we all want over the future of the European single market and the future of the European economy.’

Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies accused the Government of adopting a ‘xenophobic’ approach to Europe. ‘Far from keeping Britain strong, Cameron has ensured that we will lose our influence at the top table,’ he said.

‘By seeking to protect bankers from regulation, he has betrayed Britain’s real interests and done nothing in practice to help the City of London.

‘The fear now must be that we will increasingly lose the opportunity to affect decisions being taken that are bound to affect us.’

Fellow MEP Sharon Bowles warned the UK face ‘revenge attacks’ from the rest of Europe. She said: ‘There is already mood music within the parliament that if the UK wants it some people will take a great deal of satisfaction in making sure we don’t have it.’

By contrast, Mr Cameron’s position in his own party has been greatly strengthened – though he will now face renewed demands for a referendum as the other members of the EU forge a fiscal union.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was tempting to say well done to Mr Cameron, but insisted he had 'gained nothing'

London Mayor Boris Johnson – who piled 
pressure on Mr Cameron in the run-up to the summit, and has been 
increasingly touted as a leadership rival – said: ‘David Cameron has 
played a blinder and he has done the only thing that was really open to 
him to do.’

Eurosceptic MPs cheered the result – but made it clear that they would step up the pressure on Mr Cameron at Westminster to go further in distancing Britain from the heart of the new European project.

Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who quit the Government over Europe in October, hailed Mr Cameron’s stance as a ‘paradigm shift in our relationship with the EU’, which made a referendum more likely.

He added: ‘There is going to be inevitable pressure for further repatriation of substantial powers, and people may well be asked before the end of this parliament for their view on an in-or-out referendum.’

The leading Eurosceptic Bill Cash said the decision to wield the veto was a ‘historic moment for Europe.

He added: ‘We are now embarked on a very serious, responsible path towards renegotiating the whole of our treaty relationship.’
