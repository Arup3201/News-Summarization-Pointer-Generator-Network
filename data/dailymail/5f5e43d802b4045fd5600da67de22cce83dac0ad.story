More than 20 UK music festivals have banned the sale of 'legal highs' at their events this summer after a spike in the number of people dying from the drugs.

The festivals, which include T in the Park, Bestival, Lovebox, Global Gathering and Sonisphere, will also take part in a 'digital blackout' on Monday to highlight the danger of taking the drugs.

The websites and social media accounts of the 24 festivals involved will go dark for a day from 9am, and music fans will be met with a black window, a grey light bulb and the message 'Don't be in the Dark about Legal Highs'.

Twenty four UK festivals, including T in the Park, will ban the sale of legal highs on their grounds this summer

The festivals backing the ban have a combined audience of half a million and online audience in the millions

Blackout organiser the Association of Independent Festivals said its members had banned legal highs after minister Norman Baker warned authorities are involved in a 'race with chemists' in India and China who are producing potentially dangerous new drugs on a weekly basis.

Deaths from legal highs increased almost seven times in just three years, up from 10 in 2009 to to 68 in 2012 according to data St George's, University of London.

AIF's co-founder and vice-chairman, Ben Turner, said: 'Legal highs are a serious concern for any festival organiser and the issue is only going to get bigger.

'The substances have managed to fly under the radar purely by evolving faster than the monitoring bodies can regulate.

On Monday the festival websites will also feature a 'blackout' where users will be greeted with this screen

'Banning it at our festivals is only part of the battle however, we need to make fans aware of the dangers of legal highs and help them make safer choices when having fun on-site.'

AIF said festivals backing the blackout 
have a combined capacity of more than half a million people and an 
online followers well into the millions. It added that it hopes to make 
the blackout an annual event.

It is working with Angelus Foundation, a charity set up to educate people about the risks of legal highs.

Angelus founder Maryon Stewart added: 'Legal highs are a huge but hidden problem because young people are acting in ignorance and no-one is measuring the harms.

'As the lead organisation raising awareness of these substances, Angelus is delighted the festivals are taking the issue seriously and helping to keep their audiences safe.

Ministers warn about the risk from drugs being created in China and India faster than they can be regulated

Deaths from legal highs has spiked sharply in the last three years, up from 10 in 2009 to 68 in 2012

'We are determined to keep expanding our prevention programme into new areas and bigger events until everyone gets the message that the effects of these substances are unpredictable and high risk.'

Norman Baker said this week that the Government was examining the way the problem of legal highs was dealt with in other countries, including New Zealand where substances are set to be banned unless trials prove they are safe.

The Liberal Democrat minister said the Government was 'open-minded' about how to tackle the problem and an expert panel was reviewing the situation.
