Jourdan Dunn, Karlie Kloss and Cara Delevingne are three of the biggest names in the modelling industry - the best friend trio even call themselves the Powerpuff girls.

But with Cara enjoying some time off in Thailand with Michelle Rodriguez, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley stepped in to take her place on the catwalk at Paris Fashion Week today.

Rosie, Jourdan and Karlie all walked in the hottest show of Paris Fashion Week: Balmain.Welcome to the fash pack: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley secured her title as queen of Paris fashion week as she walked for Balmain this afternoon

Recognise us? Karlie Kloss and Jourdan Dunn, two of the industry's hottest young names, also starred in the show today

Creative director Olivier Rousteing is the king of luxe fashion and his AW14 show lived up to expectations.

The trio were adorned in lots - and lots - of leather. It came in the form of bandeau skirts, chunky biker jackets and combat trousers.

Remember the skirt-over-trouser trend circa 2001? It's back with a bang if the Balmain show was anything to go by.

Evening wear, which came with heavy embellishment and studding, is sure to be on every celebrity's wish list next season.

Her too? Puerto Rican supermodel Joan Smalls joined Balmain's model army on the catwalk in Paris today

Hell for leather! It seems that the leather trend shows no signs of abating if Olivier Rousteing's collection was anything to go by

Rihanna occupied the front row as models stomped down the catwalk in the structured dresses, which were cinched in at the waist for a super-flattering, figure-hugging fit.

Rosie has undoubtedly been the star of Paris Fashion Week so far this season and her sartorial choices have won over the fashion world.

It's been a busy few weeks for the model, who currently designs her 
own range of underwear for Marks and Spencer.

She presented the world’s biggest boy band, One Direction, with their award 
for Global Success at the Brit Awards last Wednesday evening. 

Perfect fit: The structured silhouettes are designed to cinch in the waist and flatter the figure

Look who stopped by! Rihanna, the brand's campaign star this season, took her seat on the Balmain front row

But Balmain's weren’t the only eye-catching outfits in Paris Fashion Week.

Indian
 designer Manish Arora showed off his A/W14 collection, which 
featured an array of brightly-coloured dresses, trousers and jackets.

The Indian designer, who was creative director of Paco Rabanne between 2011 and 2012, is based in New Delhi.

Arora’s
 fashion is known for its bold, psychedelic prints, vivid colours and 
extravagant embroidery, and his latest designs didn’t disappoint.

The
 collection was made up of luxe sweaters, baggy trousers, 
earmuffs, big-tongued trainers, long-sleeved velvet dresses, loose 
skirts and small across-the-body bags.
