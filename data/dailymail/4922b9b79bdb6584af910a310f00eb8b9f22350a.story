A gang of thieves used a JCB digger to smash through a wall at HSBC and steal an ATM - before being caught just 24 minutes later.

The three men, who had stolen the vehicle an hour before yesterday's raid, tore into the bank branch leaving a gaping hole in the building and pieces of brick and metal scattered across the pavement.

The snatched machine was then loaded on to a black truck, which the gang used to flee the scene near Hull, East Yorkshire.

Smash and grab: The raiders stole the JBC vehicle from a farm before using it to ram an HSBC branch and extract the ATM machine near Hull, East Yorskshire

But the raiders were caught at 3.24am by Humberside Police officers just 15 miles from the bank. 

Residents in the small village of South Cave were woken by the deafening noise of the building being repeatedly rammed and immediately called the police.

Melinda Clark, the owner of a newsagents next to the bank, said: 'It was completely unexpected and I don't think anyone can believe it has happened.

'This is a quiet, sleepy village – things like this don't happen to us. People are very shaken up.

'There were lots of witnesses, people heard what happened and were looking out of their windows but they were too scared to do anything.'

A resident who lives nearby, but asked not to be named, said she alerted the police shortly after 3am.

The JCB was repeatedly rammed into the building, leaving a gaping hole in the wall and bits of brick scattered across the pavement 

She said: 'It's the most scared I have ever been in my entire life.

'I was woken up by a huge banging and looked out the window to see three men in balaclavas ramming this vehicle into the side of the building.

'They must have driven into the bank about ten or 20 times and the noise was horrendous. I called the police straight away but I was in complete shock and couldn't believe my eyes.

'It has caused a lot of people to worry. It's made me very frightened because I was home alone with two children so I was scared for them, too.'

Less than an hour before the raid, the JCB was stolen from a farm in the nearby village of Riplingham, East Yorkshire.

The owner of the farm, who did not want to be named, said he did not know the vehicle had been taken until he received a visit from police.

He said: 'It isn't difficult to get to South Cave from where we are, so they must have broken in overnight and taken it.' 

A police spokesman said: 'Police are aware of other similar incidents in the Yorkshire region and are trying to establish whether there are any links to this incident.

'The public are urged to remain vigilant in areas where there are ATMs and report any suspicious behaviour to the police by calling 101, especially in rural locations.'

Last night, the men remained in custody and were assisting police with their enquiries.

A HSBC spokesman said the bank suffered substantial damage and would take several weeks to repair.

She said: 'We already have contractors working at the scene to make the building safe, but, unfortunately, we expect it will have to remain closed several weeks.

'We are committed to reopening the branch as soon as we can.'
