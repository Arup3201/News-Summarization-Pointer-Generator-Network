A pair of transgender lesbians today told of their joy at becoming man and wife, and also wife and wife, on the same day - after one had a sex-change.

Jenny-Anne Bishop, 65, formerly called Paul, and Elen Heart, 68, who was once named Alan, initially got together as a male gay couple in 2004.

The pair, who are both divorced and have five grown-up children between them, lived together in Clwyd, Wales, for six years as transgender lesbians.

But the couple decided against surgery due to the associated risks at their age until last year - when Jenny-Anne went under the knife for a gender reassignment op.

Father-of-two Jenny-Anne went on to have a breast augmentation procedure this January followed by facial feminisation surgery.

The couple have now officially tied the knot as 'husband and wife' after opting for a private civil ceremony in North Wales.

Retired graphic designer Elen, who takes herbal hormones to make her appearance more feminine, took on the role of groom and wore a silky red dress and bright red high heels.

The couple refer to father-of-three Elen - who started living as a woman in 2004 - as the 'groomness'.

Retired product sales manager Jenny-Anne wore a strapless cream bridal gown complete with a train and a tiara and took on the part of bride.

They were officially announced as husband and wife in front of four close friends, who attended as witnesses.

The retired newlyweds then had a gay wedding service at the Metropolitan Community Church in Manchester, where transgender friend Gabrielle was their bridesmaid.

Jenny-Anne said: 'It was a beautiful weekend. We had so much support and sheer love from our friends and the wider community.

'At the registry office Elen had to be ambiguous, so we made sure she got to celebrate her femininity at the Church, where we were pronounced "wife and wife".'

Jenny-Anne was married for 31 years before she divorced in 2000. Elen is twice divorced.

Her first marriage lasted for seven years and her second - in which she fathered a daughter and two sons - lasted for 20 years.

The couple met at a friend's Christmas party in 2004 and wrote to each other as friends for a year before becoming lovers.

They run a refuge for transgender people who struggle to be accepted and present trans-awareness training to public service providers, such as police and local councils.

Jerry-Anne, who has a granddaughter, added: 'The law has seen us go from a gay couple - to a lesbian couple - to a heterosexual couple who can get married, but basically we are just two people who love each other and wanted to publicly declare and celebrate our relationship.

'We want to encourage other transgender couples to celebrate their relationships and uniqueness.'
