Council workers dumped mounds of soil on a father’s grave, cloaking it in four feet of mud and leaving just the top of the tombstone showing.

This was the scene that greeted Shirley Wort, 63, when she went to lay some flowers on her father Ron Spiller’s grave on the 20th anniversary of his death.

But she discovered the normally immaculate plot covered in a tonne of soil and clay while workers in a JCB prepared several other graves nearby.

Grave error: Shirley Wort discovered the plot had been covered in mounds of soil

Shirley Wort, next to her father's grave at Frome Cemetery in Somerset, was horrified to see the stone buried beneath earth

Retired receptionist Shirley criticised Mendip District Council for the way it runs Easthill Cemetery in Frome, Somerset.

She said: 'I went down to put an arrangement of flowers and I was gobsmacked and angry to find it covered in soil.

Shirley Wort said the work horrified her mother

'It is like the staff had no respect for the dead or for their families. All they had to do was put the soil behind the grave.

'I understand graves need to be dug and I guess they didn’t think anyone would notice but I did.

'I was so upset to see that the grave diggers had completely covered his grave in mud, soil and clay.

'There is no respect at all and I just don’t know what is going on with them, there is no thought, it is completely insensitive.

'And I know I’m not the only one who complains about how the cemetery is run.

'My
mum is 85 and she was horrified when she heard about it. She was very 
upset. I can’t imagine what would have happened if she had actually seen
it.'

Shirley and her husband Dave are well 
known in the town for their charity work with Cardiac Risk in the Young 
(CRY) since the death of their son Julian in 2000 aged 28.

She
added: 'I’ve also had to complain in the past about the state of 
Julian’s grave, the workers there have no idea how upsetting it is to 
discover a loved one’s grave in a dishevelled way.'

A district council spokesman said: 'We 
are very sorry that Mrs Wort found her father’s grave in this condition 
and do appreciate how upsetting it must have been for her.

Shirley Wort, 63, went to Ron Spiller's grave to lay some flowers the day before the 20th anniversary of his death but found this to be the scene

The retired receptionist has condemned Mendip District Council for the way it runs Easthill Cemetery in Frome, Somerset

'The grave digging contractor was following standard practice, whereby when graves are dug the soil and earth is placed adjacent to the grave.

'This can mean that some earth is temporarily placed on top of another grave when the adjacent plots are all used, as in this case.

'We do appreciate that this can be upsetting for relatives visiting the affected graves and every effort is made to clean and reinstate the graves.

'In this particular case, our contractors moved the earth and soil from Mrs Wort’s father’s grave while she was at the cemetery.'
