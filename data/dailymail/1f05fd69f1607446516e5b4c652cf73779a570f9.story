BUBBA’S **** SHOCKER

It’s official: golf is such a frustrating game it would make even a devout Christian swear. Masters champion Bubba Watson, his game in disarray, dropped an ‘f-bomb’ after finding water at the 18th. It was the first time anyone had ever heard him swear. Angie, his 6ft 3in wife and also a committed Christian, won’t be happy.

WOOD'S RIPPING YARN

Chris Wood may have shot a flawless 66 on Thursday but the Englishman did not have it all his own way. While inspecting the green on the second hole, Wood ripped a 10in hole in his grey trousers. The 29-year-old took it in good spirits, though, as he tweeted a picture of the damage yesterday ... after changing his strides.

SPARKLING STRICKER

Early in 2013, veteran Steve Stricker semi-retired, announcing plans to cut his playing schedule in half and hoping to compete in just ‘10 or 12’ tournaments that year. Fast forward 18 months and the 47-year-old American sits five-under and finds himself four off the lead in the PGA Championship.

On the ball: Ian Poulter took the joke well

THE JOKE’S ON POULTER

Ian Poulter was simply complimenting Rory McIlroy when a quick-witted Twitter user took him down a peg: ‘In a couple years it will be just you and Rory,’ the user tweeted in reference to Poulter’s 2008 assertion: ‘I haven’t played to my full potential. When that happens it will just be me and Tiger.’ To his credit, Poulter saw the joke, replying: ‘Thats very very funny.’

'A fine young man': Rory McIlroy impressed father-of-two Timothy Campbell when he posed for pictures

FAN HAILS NICE GUY RORY

It seems Rory McIlroy can do no wrong. The 25-year-old impressed father-of-two Timothy Campbell when he posed for photos and signed autographs for his son and daughter at a local gas station. ‘He’s the #1 golfer in the world and more importantly a fine young man,’ Campbell said on his blog post. ‘Those two don’t always go together.’
