The Court of Auditors said billions of euros were handed out without proper checks, and errors are on the rise

The European Union is still wasting billions every year, spending watchdogs said today as they refused to sign off  official accounts - again.

It is the 18th successive year that the Court of Auditors has said the EU’s finances were in such a mess that they could not be given a clean bill of health. In fact errors are still on the rise.

It included a ‘special premium’ paid to a farmer for 150 sheep which did not exist and 200,000 euros paid for a two-storey "laboratory" for producing fruit in Lombardy, Italy which inspectors found had ‘predominantly the charters of a private residence’.

The revelations will heap pressure on David Cameron who suffered a humiliating Commons defeat last week as Labour and Tory rebels united to demand he insist on a cut on the vast budget at talks next month.

The 27 member states and the executive Commission stand accused of failing to do enough to track billions of pounds in spending at a time when countries are imposing deep spending cuts at homes.

The Court of Auditors said that errors in EU payments had risen to 3.9 per cent from the 2011 budget of almost 130billion euros (£104billion).

It added that there were ‘too many cases of EU money not hitting the target or being used sub-optimally’.

Acknowledging the clamour for cuts in spending, ECA President Vitor Caldeira said it was essential for the EU to disburse its current budget ‘more efficiently’.

He added: ‘Member states must agree on better rules for how EU money is spent, and member states and the European Commission must enforce them properly.’

Marta Andreasen, a UK Independence Party MEP, said: ‘If this report, outlining as it does the continued gross mismanagement of EU funds, doesn't set alarm bells ringing in Downing Street then nothing will.’

The former European Commission Chief Accountant added: ‘There is a new generation who will be voting later this month who have never known an EU with clean accounts.’

Next month EU leaders will clash at a summit clash over calls from Eurocrats and MEPs for inflation-busting rises in EU spending, with Mr Cameron threatening to veto anything but a spending freeze.

Tonight Mr Cameron faces the threat of another European rebellion in the Commons, amid concerns that closer banking ties in the eurozone could sideline the City of London.

Veteran eurosceptic Conservative Bill Cash will lead the revolt, demanding that the Prime Minister vetoes proposals to create a single eurozone banking supervisor unless there are changes to the European Union's treaties.

Mr Cash said: ‘The eurozone would be given the opportunity to outvote the non-eurozone countries, which would effectively mean Paris and Frankfurt versus the City of London. That would be singularly bad news for the City of London.’

Today's vote is unlikely to see the government defeated again, but will add to the pressure on Mr Cameron to take a tougher line with Brussels.

The Court of Auditors report said the European Commission and EU governments ‘must manage spending better’.

But the Commission responded that it was up to national and local authorities, who are responsible for disbursing about 80 per cent of the entire EU budget in regional, social and agriculture grants every year, to get their books straight.
