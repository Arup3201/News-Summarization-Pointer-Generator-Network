The actress daughter of disgraced NBC Nightly News host Brian Williams has spoken out to defend her father for the first time since he was suspended for six months for making false claims about his time in Iraq in 2003.

Girls star Allison Williams described her father was 'an honest man, a truthful man,' at an event in New York City on Wednesday evening.

She was speaking at a Q&A session to discuss her career with late night host Seth Meyers, when he asked how her family were doing following the recent scandal.

'This has been a really hard time,' she said. 'One thing this experience has not done is shake my trust and belief in him as a man. 

'He's a really good man, an honest man, a truthful man — he has so much integrity and so much respect for journalism. And yes he's a really good dad. I know you can trust him because, as any good daughter does, I've tested him on that.'

Allison spoke while 'looking down at the stage' and 'with a subdued tone,' a witness told the New York Post.

At the end of last year she starred in the critically-panned Peter Pan Live, which was aired on the same channel that suspended her father earlier this month.

Allison said her entire family were rallying round her beleaguered father.

'My mom has been so strong and my brother has been amazing. My dad has always been there for us a 100 percent of the time… so to be here for him is the least we can do,' she said.

Referencing her father's time in Iraq in 2003, she recalled how he had promised to be back in time to take her to a 9th grade father-daughter dance.

'As the day was coming, it didn't seem like he was going to make it as he had promised… I was so upset and I got a surprise call from my dad from Iraq, and he was asking if I had a date to the dance. So that's the kind of man he is.

'I can't wait until he's back on TV and I know many of you guys feel that way. Thank you for all your support.' she said to applause from the audience. 

Allison has made a name for herself playing Marnie in the HBO series Girls, but a three-hour live production of Peter Pan which aired in December proved a ratings flop for NBC.

The musical production only attracted an audience of 9.1 million viewers - less than half of what The Sound Of Music production the previous year had achieved.

Earlier on Wednesday Allison had brought some color to a Michael Kors fashion show during New York Fashion Week.

The 26-year-old had worn a royal blue two-piece ensemble featuring giant yellow blooms, including a sleeveless crop top that showed off her taut midriff, and a heavy full skirt.

The Girls star coordinated the look with royal blue pointed-toe pumps and wore her dark hair partially swept back.

Her father's departure from the Nightly News has resulted in the show losing 700,000 viewers.

Ratings for the network's Nightly News broadcast dipped by double-digits last Wednesday during its first broadcast that had suspended anchor Brian Williams' name stripped from the title.

Nielsen's 'fast affiliate numbers' revealed that the nightly telecast's 9.8million viewers from Monday night had slipped to 8.6million by Thursday in what turned out to be its lowest numbers of the week.

Williams received a six-month unpaid suspension this week after it was revealed the anchor falsely claimed he was inside a helicopter that came under fire during a mission in Iraq. 

Weekend anchor Lester Holt has temporarily taken his place.
