A rare script with an alternative ending for the Hollywood classic Gone With The Wind has emerged 75 years after the movie's release.

The 1939 film, starring Vivien Leigh as heroine Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable as her lover Rhett Butler, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time and is still the most successful at the box office, once inflation is taken into account.

The ending of the American Civil War movie sees a heart-broken Scarlett resolving to get on with life after being left by Rhett, and is celebrated for its portrayal of Leigh's character as a strong, independent woman.

The emergence of the alternate script however has revealed it could have ended on a very different note.

The 1939 film, starring Vivien Leigh as heroine Scarlett O'Hara and Clark Gable as her lover Rhett Butler, is widely regarded as one of the greatest of all time

In the alternative version, instead of speaking the famous resolute line 'After all, tomorrow is another day', Scarlett appears much more distraught, calling after her lover 'Rhett!... Rhett!... You'll come back. You'll come back... I know you will!'

It is the first time a script with this ending has emerged for sale.

Gone with the Wind took $390million at the box office, the highest grossing film of its time, and still the most successful film ever made if adjusted for inflation.

Leigh, who was married to Laurence Olivier from 1940 to 1960, won an Oscar for her portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara while Gable was nominated for best actor.

The 251-page script is thought to have belonged to a production member and was acquired by a film fan who ran a book shop in Hollywood.

It has been tipped to fetch as much as $5,000 (£3,000) when it goes under the hammer at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas.

Margaret Barrett, head of entertainment at Heritage, said: 'What's really interesting about this script is that it has an alternative ending to the one in the film.

'During the making of the film the makers played around with several different endings but eventually settled on the one we all know where Scarlett O'Hara speaks the famous line "After all, tomorrow is another day".

'The various endings are known of among the most dedicated film fans but this script just serves as proof of the changes the director made during production.

'In the original ending Scarlett comes across as a strong, determined woman who will survive with or without Rhett, but this alternative ending is much more traditional - her life has been ruined because her man left her. 

'Scarlett is such an enduring character because she is so independent. She was way ahead of her time in terms of how women were viewed.

'This alternate ending shows her life is going to be about getting Rhett Butler back whereas in the original she is sad to see him go but it's not the be all and end all.

'I think the directors made the right decision sticking with the original ending because it best shows Scarlett's true character - she was a fighter and that's why we all love her so much.

'All the cast and crew would have had their own copy of the script so there are many hundreds associated with Gone With The Wind but I've never seen one with this ending before.

'It is not annotated so it is most likely a file copy kept by the studio for their archives.

'It comes to us from a private collector who used to own a book shop on Hollywood Boulevard. He has rubbed shoulders with lots of key Hollywood figures over the years and somehow ended up with this script. We are starting bidding at $500 but it could go for $5,000."

The online auction ends on August 23.
