The four astronauts who will close Nasa's 30-year space shuttle programme aboard Atlantis arrived at the Kennedy Space Center yesterday.

Waving Stars and Stripes flags, they saluted America's 235th 
birthday and paid tribute to the engineers who contributed to the space
shuttles.

The launch countdown for the final flight of the final shuttle begins today, ahead of Friday’s lift-off at 11:26am local time (4:26pm GMT) before an estimated crowd of one million people.

But the euphoria over the launch is sparked a debate over whether it heralds the end of the space age amid claims Nasa will significantly scale down its operations due to cost.

The Washington Post in the U.S. and the Economist newspaper in Britain both argued that explorations into space peaked a long time ago and were unlikely to ever increase.

However, this debate was not on the mind of Commander Christopher Ferguson and his 
crew.

At the weekend they were given the small American flags as launch director Mike Leinbach 
greeted them on the runway at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape 
Canaveral, Florida, on their arrival from their training base in Houston.

Commander Ferguson, a retired Navy captain, told the photographers and journalists swarming on the runway: 'This is a day that's decidedly American, a day where we kind of reflect on our independence and all the wonderful things that we really have as a part of being United States of America.

‘It's wonderful that you've all came out to join us.'

Altogether, about 2,500 members of the news media have requested credentials to cover the launch.

Estimates of the crowd at the launch on Friday have also risen. Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel said between 750,000 and one million people are expected to witness the end of shuttle history.

Lift-off of the shuttle, manned by a minimal crew of four astronauts, is set for 11.26am (4.26pm GMT) on Friday

That is considerably more than the number who turned up for Discovery's last lift-off in February and Endeavour's in May.

Commander Ferguson said the four-man crew - there are usually six on a shuttle - have a very busy  12-day flight ahead.

Atlantis will make a supply run to the International Space Station, before joining Discovery and Endeavour in retirement.

‘When it's all over... we'll be very proud to put the right-hand bookend on the space shuttle programme,’ he said.

Co-pilot Douglas Hurley said: 'We're so very proud to be here sharing our nation's birthday with you all and the folks here at Kennedy, and we just want to honour the entire Kennedy team that has worked on these magnificent machines over the last 30-plus years.’

Nasa hasn't launched a shuttle with so few astronauts since 1983. The reduction is because there are no more 
shuttles to retrieve them from the space station in the event of 
serious launch damage to Atlantis; the shuttle crew would have to be 
rescued by Russia's much smaller Soyuz capsules.

Americans
will continue to hitch rides aboard Soyuz spacecraft to and from the 
space station, until private companies are able to launch their own 
spacecraft with crews. That's at least three to five years away.

The
Obama administration wants Nasa to focus on expeditions to an asteroid 
and Mars, instead of repeated trips to low-Earth orbit.

There's not enough money to do both, shuttle programme manager John Shannon told reporters last week.

‘We're sacrificing the shuttle to enable us to be able to take that next step,’ Mr Shannon said.

‘If we were going to retire the shuttle, this is the time to do it,’ he said, noting that the space station is now completed and in good shape.

Despite the overriding significance of this last shuttle flight, astronaut Rex Walheim was delighting in the little things.

He said: 'It's
such a pleasure to come down here when you have a rocket on the pad and
it's got your stuff loaded on it.'

The
three men - all with military backgrounds - are joined on the crew by 
Sandra Magnus, a civilian scientist. Each has flown in space before.

The Atlantis flight was added to the shuttle's schedule last year to buy time in case Nasa's newly hired cargo delivery companies have problems getting their spacecraft into orbit.

Atlantis will be delivering a year's worth of food, clothing, science equipment and supplies to the International Space Station, a $100billion project shared by 16 nations which circles 220 miles above Earth.

Last Tuesday, the threat of an orbital debris impact interrupted the station's preparations for the visit.

Nasa learned that an unidentified piece of space debris was likely to pass close to the station and told the crew to seek shelter in the station's two Russian Soyuz escape capsules.

Typically, the station manoeuvres to avoid potential debris impacts, but the notice came just 14 hours before the closest approach, too late to plan and conduct an avoidance manoeuvre.

Bill Gerstenmaier, Nasa's space operations chief, said: 'We think it came within about 1,100ft of the space station. It was probably the closest object that's actually come by the space station.'

The six crew members divided 
into two groups of three and sealed themselves into the Soyuz capsules 
about 20 minutes before the object came closest to the station.

It
was only the second time in the station's history that crews had to 
seek shelter in their 'lifeboats' for an orbital debris threat.

The
station's two U.S. crew members are preparing for a spacewalk during 
shuttle's Atlantis' eight-day stay, a job normally undertaken by the 
visiting astronauts.

Nasa, 
however, has been trying to keep the Atlantis crew's training as simple 
as possible, as the four shuttle astronauts already are having to do the
work of the six or seven people normally assigned to shuttle flights.

Space Exploration 
Technologies and Orbital Sciences Corp. are scheduled to begin cargo 
deliveries to the station next year. Nasa is hoping commercial companies
will be able to fly astronauts as well, though those spaceships are not
expected to be ready for at least four to five years.

Meanwhile, Nasa will pay Russia to fly its astronauts to the station at a cost of more than $50million per person.

The space shuttle was sold to America as cheap, safe and reliable. It was none of those.

It cost $196billion over 40 years, ended the lives of 14 astronauts and managed to make less than half the flights promised.

Nasa's first space shuttle flight was in April 1981. The 135th and final launch is set for Friday.

Once Atlantis lands at the end of a 12-day mission, it and the other two remaining shuttles are officially museum pieces - more expensive than any paintings.

The total price tag for the programme was more than twice the $90billion Nasa originally calculated.

Six years ago, then-Nasa chief Michael Griffin even called the shuttle programme a mistake.

But as a mistake it is one that paid off in wildly unexpected ways that weren't about money and reliability.

'The discoveries it enabled, the international co-operation it fostered and the knowledge it gained - often at great human cost - has also contributed in countless, important ways to humanity and our common progress,' former president George Bush Sr said.

Mr Bush oversaw the programme's early days as vice-president, a job that has traditionally included supervising Nasa.

University of Colorado science policy professor Roger Pielke Jr., who studies shuttle costs and policies, said there are probably other ways the U.S. could have spent several billion dollars a year on a human space programme and gained more.

When the shuttle succeeded, it did so in a spectacular way. But its failures were also large and tragic.

Seven astronauts died when Challenger exploded about a minute after launch in 1986 and seven more died when Columbia burned up as it returned to Earth in 2003.

One out of every 67 flights ended in death - a fatality rate that would make the most ardent daredevil cringe.

Based on deaths per million miles travelled, the space shuttle is 138 times riskier than a passenger jet.

Former astronaut and past Nasa associate administrator Scott Horowitz said: ‘While the shuttle is the most magnificent engineering feat, its complexity and the naive belief that it would be as safe as an airliner was its Achilles heel.'

The concept behind it was based on a three-step space plan, ultimately ending on Mars, said George Mueller, the former top official who is credited as the father of the space shuttle programme.

To get to Mars, Nasa needed a space station circling Earth as a jumping-off point.

In 1971, President Nixon gave Nasa only the shuttle. It had no place to go. The space station wasn't built until 1998.

Budget cuts ordered by the Nixon White House meant that the fuel tank would be jettisoned with each flight and the boosters would fall into the ocean after launch and have to be retrieved and refurbished extensively.

The shuttle will likely go down in history as an anomaly of America's space programme.
