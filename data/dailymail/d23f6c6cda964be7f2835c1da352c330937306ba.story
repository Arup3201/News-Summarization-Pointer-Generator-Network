While we are often told of the benefits of 'coming clean', refusing to apologise can actually make people feel better than those who say sorry, according to a new study.

Scientists have found that the feelings of empowerment that come with refusing to make amends for a mistake can outweigh feelings of relief experienced when saying sorry.

Researchers Tyler G. Okimoto, Michael Wenzel and Kyli Hedrick, from the University of Queensland, surveyed 228 Americans and asked them to remember a time they 
had done something wrong.

While most people remembered relatively trivial 
offenses, some remembered serious offences, including crimes such as
 theft, NPR reports.

The team then asked the subjects whether they had said sorry, or 
made a decision not to apologise even though they knew they were in the 
wrong.

They also split the group at random - instructing some to write an email where they apologised for their actions, or compose an 
email refusing to say sorry.

When faced with making a difficult life decision, many of us can spend hours agonising over what to do.

But new research has discovered that this is perhaps not the best way to find a solution. Instead, we should trust our intuition and make a quick decision.

Researchers in Portugal found that decisions made on the spur of the moment are just as good as when we take our time.

They discovered that when rats were challenged with a series of perceptual decision problems, their performance was just as good when they decided rapidly as when they took a much longer time to respond.

In both cases, Okimoto said, refusing to apologise provided 
psychological benefits.

The same thing also happened when people were asked to imagine doing 
something wrong, and then imagine apologising or refusing to apologise.

The research group said it could give an explanation as to whyÂ  people are so often 
reluctant to say sorry.

Okimoto said when we refuse to apologise, it actually makes us feel more empowered.

He said: 'That power and control seems to translate into greater feelings of self-worth.'

He added: 'We do find that apologies do make apologisers feel better, but the 
interesting thing is that refusals to apologise also make people feel 
better and, in fact, in some cases it makes them feel better than an 
apology would have.'
