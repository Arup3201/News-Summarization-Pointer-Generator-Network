President Barack Obama had a secret, and decided to share it with an assembly at the White House.

Officiating an awards ceremony for the National Medal of Arts, the Leader of the Free World presented an award to music legend Linda Ronstadt.

After shaking hands with the singer, Obama whispered something into the singer's ear, according to CNN.

He then admitted into the microphone: 'I told Linda Ronstadt I had a crush on her back in the day.'

The announcement was met with laughter by the crowd.

It is not known how Ronstadt answered.

The 11-times Grammy Award winner, known for songs like You're no good and Desperado, Ronstadt is considered the 'first lady of rock' after she became the first female singer to tour arenas.

At 68, she is one of the best-selling artists in the world.

Ronstadt was among 11 other recipients of the 2013 National Medal of Arts.

On the stage, Obama also thanked NPR Radio talk show host Diane Rehm, another Medal of Arts winner, for interviewing him when he was a struggling writer, and long before he was President.

"I've been personally touched by all sorts of these folks. " Adding, "I know all of you have been touched similarly by all of these amazing people. We are very grateful to you."

The National Medal of Arts is the 'highest award given to artists and arts patrons by the federal government'.

Obama says all of the honorees have brought the world 'moments of understanding or awe or joy or sorrow, they add texture to our lives'.

'They are not incidental to the American experience, they are central to it,' he said.

'They are essential to it. So we not only congratulate you this afternoon, we thank you for an extraordinary lifetime of achievement.'
