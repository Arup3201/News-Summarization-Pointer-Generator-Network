Their destination was Australia - a place they could call home.

These historic moments of resettlement were captured as new arrivals landed on Aussie shores after World War II.

The photographs have been released by The National Archives in Canberra as they launched a new exhibition to give insight into life in Australia's migrant hostels.

The National Archives in Canberra has launched a new photographic exhibition which gives insight into life in Australia's migrant hostels. Pictured is a migrant family entering their new home in Maribyrnong, Victoria in 1965

While 20,000 photos were handed over by the Department of Immigration, curator Amy Lay told the ABC that 50 images have been chosen to feature at the exhibition - A Place to Call Home? Migrant Hostel Memories - which will be on display until September 14.

'We found the hostels were the most evocative sets of photographs so lots of people had experiences they could relate to... they brought back lots of memories,' she said.

Migrant hostels were established around Australia after World War II to accommodate the vast number of newcomers.

The hostels were described as basic with shared washing and eating facilities by National Archives of Australia.

They were occupied by thousands of resettlers. For some, their stay was brief while others lived there for months or even years.

'There was a large shortage of accommodation, so the idea would be they would provide a stepping stone for migrants into life in Australia, so they could get help finding a job, they could get English lessons if they needed them,' Ms Lay said.

The exhibition, A Place to Call Home? Migrant Hostel Memories, features 50 archived images released by the Department of Immigration. Pictured is an Asian woman using the cooking facilities in Tamarind, Northern Territory in 1984

However, in 1967 Turkey became the first country beyond Western Europe to sign an Assisted Passage agreement with Australia, prompting an increase in immigration from Turkey

The archive's exhibition shows a mixture of official government photos and personal recounts of migrants who lived in the hostels.

The vivid photographs portray how friendships were formed, challenges that were encountered and the start of a new life in Australia.

However Ms Lay believes the personal insights bring the exhibition to life.

'The Department of Immigration wanted to show a certain side of these hostels, they wanted to show the positive side,' she said.

'But those personal images actually draw back the real experiences in the hostels... the places might not have been as luxurious as they thought.'

While the images may rekindle memories for some, it will also give the rest of the country rare and unique vision into the difficulties faced by early migrants, Ms Lay said.
