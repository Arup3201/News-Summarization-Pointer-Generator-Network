A former boxing champion on licence from prison beat a man to death in a takeaway then demanded money back for his stained jumper, a court heard.

Edward Ives, 29, went 'berserk' after Ben Mahoney confronted him for storming aggressively into his local kebab shop.

A court heard that Mr Mahoney grabbed the hood of Ives’ Superman hoodie and threw an 'ineffective' punch at him.

But Ives, who was high on crack cocaine, angrily swiped Mr Mahoney’s cup of Turkish tea from the counter, splashing it onto his jumper sleeve.

He then hit the 30 year-old with such force he left him 'dead standing up' against a fridge.

Before leaving he demanded £90 compensation as fatally injured Mr Mahoney slumped unconscious to the floor of the House on the Hill takeaway in Dartford, Kent.

The counter staff refused but when Ives threatened to kill everyone in the takeaway they handed him £30 - and a refund for his kebab and two cheeseburgers.

Ives, a father-of-two, was arrested two hours later when police found him hiding under a child’s bed.

A jury heard he had only been released on licence from a prison after being sentenced for witness intimidation six weeks before the attack in April.

Ian Hope, prosecuting, said: 'Those watching and those who had tried to stop the first fight were simply too frightened to intervene at all in this fight because of the aggression and violence coming from Ives, the force of the blows he was using and his general conduct to all those in the shop.

'He also demanded payment for the inconvenience of having dirtied his sleeve.

'The terrified staff paid him the £30 he demanded in compensation and the money he had already paid for his kebab and burger.

'He then left, striding out of the restaurant.'

A postmortem found Mr Mahoney died at the scene from a haemorrhage to an artery in his neck caused by a sudden and twisting motion.

Takeaway manager Cafir Zorlu told Maidstone Crown Court: 'I had never seen a person die before and you could tell he was dead standing up.

'You could hear the punches.

'If Ben didn’t die I’m assuming he would have been paralysed somehow because the punches were just too strong.

'His eyes, the pupils, you could see the pupils. His eyes weren’t there, you know? He was just shaking maybe in shock I suppose.

'I think Ben was throwing up as there was liquid coming out of his mouth.

Police at the House on the Hill takeaway in East Hill, Dartford, after an incident in which Ben Mahoney died, Ives allegedly threatened to kill everyone in the shop if he didn't get money back for his troubles

Takeaway manager Cafir Zorlu told the court that he could tell Mr Mahoney was 'dead standing up' after the fight

'Ben was standing, knocked out. He wasn’t retaliating, he wasn’t fighting back.'

Ives, from Dartford, who is pleading self-defence, told the jury it was Mr Mahoney who started the fight.

He said he was not looking for trouble and just wanted a kebab.

But he admitted taking crack cocaine before entering the takeaway and was upset his girlfriend had thrown him out of her home.

Mr Ives, who was an Olympic boxing hopeful at school, told the court he felt 'devastated' about the attack.

He said: 'If I thought he was seriously hurt I would have helped the boy. I didn’t mean to hurt him. It’s just terrible what happened. Tragic.

'I feel devastated. It’s made me feel ill. I have got to live with it for the rest of my life.

'He was only a young lad, weren’t he? Only my age. It’s just a tragic accident. It’s a terrible shame.

'I was a bit upset, do you know what I mean? I went out for a kebab, I didn’t go out for no trouble. I was quite annoyed.'

Ives denies manslaughter and the trial continues.
