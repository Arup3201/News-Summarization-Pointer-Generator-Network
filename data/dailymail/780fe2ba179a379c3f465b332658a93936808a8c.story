On any other day, she would certainly have stood out from the crowd.

But the Queen almost blended into the background at a children’s hospital in Australia yesterday – because the staff’s shocking pink uniforms perfectly matched her Stewart Parvin crepe coat.

The monarch couldn’t help smiling when she spotted the co-ordinated line-up that awaited her as she opened the £65million Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne.

It came on the same day it was revealed that the Queen’s grandson William and his wife Kate will help victims of
 famine in East Africa by packing aid boxes for UNICEF.

Elsewhere in Melbourne, the Queen continued attracting plenty of attention – particularly when she swapped her usual chauffeur-driven cars for a trip on public transport.

As she settled into a seat on the number 72 tram for an eight-minute journey along St Kilda Road, her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, joked to driver Joyleen Smith: ‘Let’s go. We’re running late!’

The pair’s seniors’ concessions tickets – at £1.80 each – were paid for by their Australian equerry, Commander Andrew Willis.

It is the first time the Queen has travelled by tram since she boarded one during the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002.

In honour of the royal passengers, 
the white Z3-Class vehicle had been transformed with a red, white and 
blue exterior colour scheme and inside it had been refurbished and 
restored.

A dot-matrix 
screen at its front displayed the world's 'Royal Tram' while a smaller 
one was lit-up with the monarch's initials 'ER'.

Ms Smith, a tram driver for almost seven years, described today's event as an 'honour'.

She
 added: 'When they got on I said hello to the Queen, and Philip said, 
"Come on driver, let's go, we're running late", so I thought we better 
go.

'He said it with a smile on his face and I know he's got a wicked sense of humour.'

The
 Queen and the Duke boarded the tram at Stop 13 in Melbourne's 
Federation Square and travelled along St Kilda Road to a reception and 
lunch with local politicians at Government House.

They
 had been held up during a walkabout through the square as dozens of 
well-wishers had wanted to hand flowers and presents to the royals as 
tens of thousands looked on.

The royal couple sat facing each other with the Premier of Victoria, Ted Baillieu, and his wife Robyn sat side-by-side close by.

The
 Queen may be more used to travelling in a chauffeur driven state 
Bentley or Rolls-Royce but she appeared at home on public transport.

And
 like any other passenger she had to pay her way - although her 
Australian equerry Commander Andrew Willis had the job of buying her 
ticket.

They used a 
myki - a pre-paid travel card - but it is not known if they chose the 
two-hour zone one fare costing 3.80 Australian dollars (£2.38) or opted 
for the cheaper 2.80-dollar (£1.73) senior citizen option.

Four
 mounted officers from Victoria Police escorted the royal tram which 
travelled at walking pace, around 3mph, during the eight-minute journey.

Among
 the two horses that led the way was Super Impressive, a former 
racehorse that had earned around 1.5 million Australian dollars 
(£900,000) during its former career.

The royal couple waved at the thousands who lined their route and the crowds cheered and screamed in response.

Their
 journey took them along part of the route of the number 8 tram which 
runs from Brunswick depot to the wealthy Melbourne suburb of Toorak.

Ms
 Smith, who drives trams along the inner-city routes 1, 8 and 19, said 
she had taken commuters along the stretch of track used by the royals 
hundreds of times.

She 
added: 'A couple of times I got a little overwhelmed and thought I was 
going to cry - all the people were waving at her. At one point I even 
waved at someone I recognised.

'But despite being nervous at first it was overwhelming, what an honour to drive the Queen.'

Earlier,
 the Queen had met two former conjoined twins when she opened the Royal Children's Hospital - one of the 
world's leading centres for paediatric health care and clinical support.

The institution cost more than one billion Australian 
dollars (£65million) to build, and is the largest project of its kind in the
 Commonwealth country.

Trishna
 and Krishna Mollick were born joined at the top of their heads and 
shared brain tissue and blood vessels but were successfully separated in
 November 2009.

The 
twins, now aged five and originally from Bangladesh, had intended to 
greet the Queen with a curtsy but for Trishna the occasion became too 
much.

Overwhelmed by all the applause, she ran off when the Queen approached her, leading the monarch to ask: 'Where's she gone?'

Trishna's legal guardian, Moira Kelly, explained: 'She's got a bit frightened by all the clapping.'

The Queen smiled and as she walked on little Trishna reappeared and performed a ballerina curtsy in the distance.

As well as its state-of-the-art 
medical equipment, the hospital has one unusual feature - a large 
aquarium and a meerkat enclosure to help soften the mood in the 
institution for the children.

The
 hospital's chairman Tony Beddison said the idea was to have a facility 
which was not foreboding or frightening to the young patients.

When
 the royal tour of Melbourne took the Queen and duke to a gallery of 
Australian art, Philip found himself getting the wrong end of the stick.

All those involved saw the funny side as the confusion arose over an actual stick, meant to be a gift to the Queen.

Although
 possibly one of the more modest gifts the Queen has received in her 
59-year reign, the eucalyptus twig in question was, in fact, art.

It
 was part of an Aboriginal-inspired collaborative artwork in which 
children have painted messages on sticks and made a nest out of them.

When
 she was presented with the stick and its message of hope and 
sustainability by 16-year-old Eli Ivey, the Queen looked suitably 
grateful during her tour of the Ian Potter Centre, part of the National 
Gallery of Victoria.

Philip,
 however, did not twig the significance of the item and said: 'Put it on
 the nest,' prompting the assembled dignitaries to burst out laughing.

It
 may not have been what was planned, but Eli did not need asking twice, 
and dutifully took it over to the Bunjil's Nest sculpture, where he 
carefully laid it with the other sticks.

The teenager refused to be downhearted following his royal setback. 'It was fine,' he said. 'The Queen appreciated the stick.'
