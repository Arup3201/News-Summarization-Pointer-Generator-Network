Authorities in Iran have arrested a spy working for MI6, according to media reports in the country.

The man was arrested in the city of Kerman in the south-east of the country after authorities spent months tracking him down, the ISNA news agency said.

A Kerman judiciary official, who was not named, said the suspect had exchanged information with four British intelligence operatives on 11 occasions.

The man  has not been identified but the report said he is currently standing trial and has confessed.

Iran regularly claims to have captured foreign agents but they are usually released without charge months later.

The British Embassy in Tehran was closed in late 2011 after hardliners overran the building.

The news comes as Iran and Britain begin attempting to re-establish diplomatic relations after the country's envoy made his first visit to London this week.

The visit followed a temporary deal on Iran's nuclear programme.

Iran last month agreed to curb some of its nuclear activities in return for £4.3bn relief from economic sanctions, after days of talks in Geneva.

Earlier this week it was revealed that Robert Levinson, an American who was kidnapped in Iran nearly seven years ago and kept as a hostage, was working for the CIA on an off-the-books intelligence operation when he disappeared.
