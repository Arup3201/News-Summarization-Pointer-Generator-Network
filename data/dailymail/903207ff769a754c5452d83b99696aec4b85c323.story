The divorced mother-of-two who famously lost custody of her children because she had an abortion has now been ordered to return thousands in child support.

Lisa Mehos, 38, was ordered by a judge to return $50,000 to Houston banker Manuel Mehos - her ex-husband. He was also relieved of all obligations to pay further child support to the tune of $5,000 a month.

The decision comes after she admitted to having sex with a friend one year after her five year marriage to Mehos, 59, came to an end in 2011 - the fling resulted in her being pregnant and having an abortion.

Her husband used the abortion against her in court to increase his custody prospects.

Shocked: Lisa Mehos is in disbelief she has to pay back $50,000 in child support and will no longer receive payments from ex-husband Manuel Mehos

Lisa Mehos was 'shocked' at the latest ruling and said she may lose her Upper West Side apartment, the New York Daily News reported.

A final decision in custody over the couple's children is imminent, Manuel Mehos currently has temporary custody.

Thursday's decision is the latest in a series of court hearings, the mother-of-two says have left her feeling 'raped and beaten.'

Speaking to the New York Post, she said: 'I’m divorced. I’m not Mother Teresa! I feel like I’ve been beaten up and raped.

'I had sex with someone I knew for 20 years, and I’m somehow this terrible, bad parent!'

Lisa lost temporary custody of her daughter Macy, six, and son John, four, in August.

She now only sees her children on Mondays and alternate weekends. 'It just breaks my heart. They're so confused,' she said.

Devastated: Lisa Mehos fears she may lose custody of her two children because her ex is using her abortion - which she had nearly a year after their divorce - as evidence against her in court

Mr Mehos, 59, and his 'relentless' attorney Eleanor Alter even went so far as to suggest that Mrs Mehos' abortion undermined her claim of being a Catholic, which in turn speaks to her overall credibility.

After subpoenaing Mrs Mehos' medical records to show that she indeed had an abortion, Ms Alter used the procedure to suggest she was a hypocrite for asking to have custody of her two children over Easter.

The lawyer - who referred to the abortion in court as 'late', even though it was done during the first trimester - also argued that the procedure undermined Mrs Mehos' testimony that she had never had other men over to her house.

Mrs Mehos' lawyers asserted, however, that she 'never testified that she didn’t go 
out on a date with another man, or she didn’t go to another man’s 
apartment.'

They added that on the rare occasions 
when she did leave the house, she would leave her two children, then two
 and four, in the care of her mother.

Judge
 Sattler openly sided with Mr Mehos, saying in court that the abortion 
is 'relevant', a ruling that left Mrs Mehos 'completely shocked'.

Both slinging mud: Manuel Mehos, 59 (left) and his 'relentless' attorney Eleanor Alter have claimed that Mrs Mehos' abortion undermines her claim of being a Catholic - she claims he paid for sex in massage parlors and beat her

Even more shocking to her was the 'double 
standard' used in the trial; while the judge ruled her abortion as relevant to the case, Mr
 Mehos' sexual behavior - ie the fact that he had paid for sex at massage 
parlors - was ruled irrelevant.

Attorney Emily Jane Goodman, a recent addition to Mrs Mehos' legal 
team, had asked that Judge Sattler recuse herself because she had shown 
'repeatedly' that 'the court has made up its mind about the case,' and 
that Mrs Mehos can expect to lose, but the judge has remained.

'The idea of using an abortion against a woman in a custody case sets women's rights back'

She has also pointed out the ethical issues in allowing the abortion as evidence, stating: 'The very idea
 of. . .using against a woman in a custody case the fact 
that she may have had an abortion sets women's rights and the rights of 
choice back in a way that I can’t imagine this Court would want to be 
associated.'

It's not the first time the couple have made headlines for a court appearance.

Mr Mehos was arrested last year and accused of battering his wife, charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed her black eye was from a Botox injection, not physical violence - a claim Mrs Mehos called 'ridiculous'.
