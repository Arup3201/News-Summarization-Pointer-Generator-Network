Jailed: Junior Henry has been locked up for four and a half years after he stabbed a man during this year's Notting Hill carnival

A teenage thug photographed stabbing a man during the Notting Hill Carnival has been jailed for four and a half years... and could be out in just two years.

Junior Henry, 17, was caught on camera as he tried to flee the scene after plunging a knife into the abdomen of Rio Andre as the carnival drew to its conclusion on August 29.

Valentine Simatchenko, a Russian bystander who witnessed the attack, was dubbed a 'hero' after attempting to trip up Henry as he ran from the scene while police officers stood motionless.

Today campaigners have expressed their outrage at the relatively light sentence.

Jean Taylor, of Families for Justice, said she was shocked the thug was not locked up earlier.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'This yob we be out in two years if he behaves himself. The police must be so frustrated when all their hard work ends in sentences like this.'

Following the sentencing it was revealed that Henry was acquitted of the murder of pharmaceutical student Yasin Abdirahman in a trial at the Old Bailey during 2009.

He was found guilty of conspiracy to cause GBH and violent disorder but was spared prison by The Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont QC.

Instead he was given a supervision order but it was reported that he had broken that many times, include after being a 'final warning' by Judge Beaumont.

Today the same judge was residing as he sentenced the teenager to prison, while also lifting an order banning the naming of Henry.

The Old Bailey heard that Henry, who was aged 16 at the time of the attack, was caught on CCTV wielding a knife, rushing at Andre and then plunging a knife into the student.

The court was also hold of Mr Simatchenko's attempted intervention as he tried to escape.

Mr Andre was rushed to hospital where he spent five days undergoing operations for nerve and tendon damage.

In a victim impact statement he said he was suffering 'flashbacks' of the attack.

Henry was only caught after his picture was published online and in the national newspapers and a policeman recognised him. He was arrested as he left his Hammersmith home still wearing the scarf he wore during the knifing.

He later admitted wounding with intent.

Sentencing Henry at the Old Bailey, Judge Beaumont said: 'In September 2007, when you were just 12-years-old, you were caught up in gang related mob violence on an estate in West London, in which a young man died an another was injured and had to flee for his life. 

'You were tried before me for the murder and acquitted. You were convicted of conspiracy to cause GBH and violent disorder.

'The sentence that I passed in May 2009 was a three-year supervision order. That sentence was to reflect your extreme youth at the time of the events. 

'Since passing that sentence in May 2009 I have twice varied that order because you breached it.'

In November 2009, a six-month curfew was added, and on March 7 this year the length of the order was altered.

Judge Beaumont added: 'You left this court on March 7 with my warning ringing in your ears. On March 16, you committed the offence of assault by battery for which you were convicted in the youth court on July 26 and bailed on the condition you would appear at this court for sentence.

'A month later at the Notting Hill Carnival on August 26 you took out a knife and used it to stab a man causing serious injury.

'At the time you committed that offence you were in breach of the supervision order, in breach of bail and awaiting sentence for battery.'

In 2009 Henry was the youngest of ten youths convicted after London Metropolitan University student Yasin was set upon by masked youths armed with baseball bats, broken bottles and knives.

The gang were looking for rivals The Gritset when they chanced upon him and a friend as they walked back to his flat after seeing two girls off at a bus stop.

He was stabbed three times in the head, with one blow piercing his brain and he died eight days later in hospital.

Yasin was a blameless victim targeted as part of an initiation ceremony by the notorious MDP gang  - responsible for numerous attacks including the murder of Kodjo Yenga.

In total 20 youths were arrested and three were jailed for murder, one for manslaughter and the 17-year-old was one of six jailed for violent disorder and conspiracy to cause GBH.
