The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's newborn son will 'suck the blood' of Russia in the mid-21st century and should therefore not be celebrated, a controversial Russian politician declared today.

Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the nationalist Liberal Democrat Party, declared 'I don't care about the heir' before accusing the British monarchy of 'destroying our state'.

The outspoken politician made his attention-grabbing comments in an interview with the state-run newspaper Rio Novosti.

Not happy: Outspoken politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 67, says the new baby will 'suck Russia's blood'

Quoted in the International Business Times, he said : 'The British monarchy... destroyed our state.Â  Today, our opposition activists are there, so that's why there's no joy.

'That is why the birth of another British monarch, who will suck our blood somewhere in the mid-21st century, cannot bring us any kind of happiness.'

However Russian's official response was more positive, with the Kremlin congratulating the Queen and welcoming her new great-grandson.

The British and Russian royal families are linked via King George V, who was first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II, whom some blame for the downfall of the Romanov dynasty in 1917.

Tsar Nicholas II was ill-prepared to rule when he inherited the crown from his father and eventually abdicated in favour of his brother, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich.

The Provisional Government then took over, effectively ending the Romanov dynasty's rule over Russia.
