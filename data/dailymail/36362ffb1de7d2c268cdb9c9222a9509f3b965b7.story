Princess Maxima, who will become Queen of Holland following her mother-in-law's abdication, looks eerily similar to pop sensation Britney Spears, according to internet observers.

Maxima Zorreguieta, the wife of Willem-Alexander, who will be King William IV, has been compared to the 31-year-old troubled pop singer, who burst onto the music scene in 1999 and has since endured a failed marriage and a number of controversies.

Gawker user EbenHJ agreed that the pair resembled each other. He said: 'Yeah, except I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that she wears underwear and has never got married in Las Vegas for 72hrs and then shaved her head. Other than they they could totally be the same person.'

The resemblance is uncanny, even though there is a 10-year age gap

Jamie Beck on entertainment website Crushable also noticed the uncanny resemblance, saying: 'I guess you could blame the tanned, flaxen haired beauty myth that they are both trying to resemble, ingrained as it is in the consciousness of so many.

'They have the same bad dye/extensions job, the same heavy eye makeup, and the same vague look that something isn’t right.'

Princess Maxima, 40, has been in the spotlight ever since the Netherlands' reigning queen, Beatrix,
 who turns 75 on January 31st, announced Monday that she would abdicate 
the throne to her son this spring, so that the
 crown could to pass to 'a new generation'.
