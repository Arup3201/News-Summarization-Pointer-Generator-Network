Lenient: Craig Real, 21, was spared jail despite previously being convicted of manslaughter

A youth stole a TV weeks after he was released from prison for manslaughter - but was spared jail because it was his first burglary.

Craig Real was 16 when he and two friends beat Big Issue seller Ralph Millward to death outside a 
Waitrose store in Bournemouth, Dorset, because he would not give them cigarettes.

The trio were convicted of manslaughter and handed almost five years' jail each.

But two months after leaving prison this year, Real broke into a garden summer house in nearby Poole and stole a TV worth £250.

Bournemouth magistrates referred the case to the town's crown court because they thought their sentencing powers - of six months' jail - were not enough.

But instead a judge said Real, now 21, could be spared prison and sent on a 'Thinking Skills' programme instead.

Recorder Richard Onslow, said: 'You are 21 and whatever else you have 
been convicted of you have no offences for burglary on your record.

'Do not regard this as a let off. You should regard it as a chance to change your life.'

The two Conservative MPs for Bournemouth are now asking the Attorney General to review the sentence.

Tobias Ellwood, for Bournemouth East, said: 'I am astonished. The 
magistrates had clearly determined a minimum sentence of six months and 
were looking for something stronger.

'This
 was clearly not his first crime. You don’t somehow move into a 
different category of crime and have your past misdeeds wiped clean.'

Conor Burns for Bournemouth West added: 'This 
young man was very lucky that he wasn’t eligible for an adult sentence 
for the despicable crime he committed in [2009].

'The
 fact that he has emerged from prison and is clearly addicted to a life 
of crime shows the criminal justice system is not working.'

Sentencing: Real outside a previous hearing at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court, where his case was referred to the town's crown court because magistrates decided their sentencing powers were not sufficient

Real was the eldest of three friends who were convicted of manslaughter in 2010 after a five-week trial at Winchester Crown Court.

Together with Warren Crago, 16, and Jimmy Ayres. 15, he was caught on CCTV jokily re-enacting 
the attack on 41-year-old Mr Millward as the trio made off from the scene.

Minutes after the attack Real returned to the scene with a shopping trolley which he rammed into Mr Millward’s body.

The Big Issue seller's injuries were so horrific they were compared to that of a car accident victim.

Despite being under 18, the boys were named by the court after their actions were deemed so 'frankly appalling' that it was in the public
 interest to know what they had done.

Real was jailed to four years and nine
 months. He served half that time before being released but 
failed to keep to set conditions, and was rearrested to serve his full 
sentence.

He was then released at the end of his term in February this year before committing the burglary on April 16.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard the owners of the house in Poole, where Real lives, said they had felt 'violated' by the crime.

Police discovered Real was the culprit after they found his fingerprints at the scene.

Robert Grey, mitigating, pointed out 
that there was no damage to the property.

Real had pleaded guilty and said he only went into the 
summer house because he was homeless.

Recorder Onslow handed Real a 12-month community order and told him to attend a ‘Thinking Skills’ programme, which teaches young offenders basic problem skills and develops the way they think and behave.

He was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to the TV's owners.

A spokesman for the Attorney General said the case has not yet been formally referred to their office, but lawyers have up to 28 days to make the application.

If the Attorney General deems it worthy of consideration it will be put before three Court of Appeal judges.

The spokesman added: 'It only takes one person to refer a case to us and all cases are considered.'
