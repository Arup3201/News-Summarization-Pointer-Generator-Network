Brighton captain Gordon Greer admits his team may have to resort to the ‘dark side’ to stop Arsenal in Sunday’s televised FA Cup tie if they want to upset the FA Cup holders and have a chance of progressing to the fifth round.

Even though the Championship side have a reputation for playing expansive, passing football in the same style of Arsenal, the Scotland centre half concedes that they may have to sacrifice their principles on Sunday and be more physical and direct to stop Arsenal.

‘All football teams need that,’ said Greer, who was labelled ‘brutal’ by Poland striker Robert Lewandowski after a recent clash against Scotland. ‘You can’t just play football all the time. You need the dark stuff and we’ve got that and I’m sure Arsenal have as well.’

But Greer insists that he wants Arsenal to play their best team, including Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla, even though it will make their task that much harder.

‘If you asked anyone in our dressing room, they would rather see the strongest team out there. It’s great to see how you can compete against them. It’s not something you get the opportunity to do that often.

‘I watched Arsenal last week against Manchester City and they were unbelievable. But you don’t play football to play against people who are easy – you want to play against the very best players.’

And Brighton manager Chris Hughton knows how Arsenal can pass their way through sides all too well. Hughton was manager at Norwich last season when Jack Wilshere scored the goal of the season against his side – after a stunning ten-pass move.

Asked whether he could admire the artistry involved, Hughton said: ‘It’s certainly not what you think at the time! 

'When you see it again you try to evaluate and see could we have stopped it at source. There was probably one time in the move itself where we could have done better. 

'But the last parts we couldn’t have done and eventually you have to hold your hands up. There are times when it’s very, very difficult to cope with Arsenal.

‘We all know the magnitude of the job, irrespective of the team they play on Sunday. In the past, if they made changes they had good young players to come in and the age of the team would have gone down dramatically. What they have now is experience and if they make changes they will have players that have played a lot of games for them.’
