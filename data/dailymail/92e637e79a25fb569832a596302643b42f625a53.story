There's always been suspicion that police had quotas to meet when it came to speeding fines, but now there's proof. 

Emails seen by an Adelaide newspaper have revealed that South Australian police are in fact being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks, pressured to 'hammer' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution.

South Australian police have adamantly denied the claims saying there are 'no quotas' only a benchmark model to ensure officers always maintained the ability to apply discretion.

Emails seen by an Adelaide newspaper have revealed that South Australian police are being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks, pressured to 'hammer' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution.

South Australian police have denied there are quotas for traffic fines saying only a benchmark model to ensure officers always maintained the ability to apply discretion.

The Advertiser discovered that a sergeant from the Sturt police station told staff in February this year that he's expecting the senior sergeant to have some words.

The emails read, 'we fell below our expected returns for traffic contacts for the last reporting period. We’ll hammer those poor people who choose to drive when we’re night shift.'

Again another email in May, from a different sergeant, showed police still had concerns with the figures they were seeing, acknowledging he was aware of the 'high caution rate'.  

'I understand it is the officers discrepancy, but for any of the ‘fatal five’ (road safety issues) ... strict enforcement should occur.' 

'Currently, Sturt LSA (local service area) is running at over 30 per cent cautioning.'

An email to SA police officer read, 'we fell below our expected returns for traffic contacts for the last reporting period. We’ll hammer those poor people who choose to drive when we’re night shift.'

'There are NO quotas. I make no secret of the fact that we have broad road safety benchmarks.' said SA police commissioner Gary Burns

In response to claims that police were given quotas, SA Police Commissioner Gary Burns released a statement saying he wanted to outline the facts regarding his letter to all staff in May about his expectations for road safety.

'I want to take the opportunity to put on the record again - very clearly - that there are NO quotas. However, I, and the Executive, make no secret of the fact that we have broad road safety benchmarks.' Mr Burns said.

'These are NOT quotas. Benchmarks are allocated to an LSA, Branch or area to ensure they achieve a set number of traffic contacts, they are not allocated to individual officers.'

'Preventing injury and fatalities on our roads through education and enforcement is a core function for SAPOL and must be addressed by all members as seriously as the prevention of crime and other core functions.'

The Commissioner said a benchmark model was key to ensuring members always maintain the ability to apply discretion.

'For example, a driver committing a minor traffic breach could be issued with a caution or an Expiation Notice. Either is acceptable and is recorded as a "contact" and counted towards the benchmarks set for your area.' he said.

Emails seen by an Adelaide newspaper have revealed that South Australian police are being pushed to hit their traffic fine benchmarks, pressured to 'hammer' drivers instead of letting them off with a caution.

'I repeat - the benchmark process was deliberately designed to allow all members to use discretion.'

'The most important issue is that a driver who has done the wrong thing is spoken to and dealt with in some manner - documented caution, TIN, report or arrest.'

'The benchmarks are not onerous and are regularly reviewed. It is particularly unhelpful when members remain misinformed or are deliberately mischievous in the public domain.'

'I expect every operational member to enforce laws which influence driver behaviour and reduce the trauma on our roads - and I make no apology for it.' said Mr Burns.

Deputy Opposition Leader Vickie Chapman told The Advertiser, Police Minister Tony Piccolo must confirm whether the benchmarks that police were being required to meet were actually quotas.

'If this is the case and officers are being required to meet quotas for traffic infringements, I am sure South Australians will be rightfully annoyed and disappointed with the Weatherill Labor Government,' she said.

'Police officers want to be out doing their job and protecting the community. They don’t want to be spending time filling quotas.'
