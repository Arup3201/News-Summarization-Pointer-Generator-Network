A tragedy occurred when a couple of young boys who were playing in a car accidentally put the vehicle into drive, running over a 1-year-old baby girl.

Jay'lah Keith, who was one, was playing in her grandma's front yard in East St Louis, Missouri when the boys who were listening to music in the car put it into gear, sending the car forward.

Little Jay'lah died from her injuries.

Tragic: Whitney Cole, mother of 15-month-old Jay'lah Keith who was run over by a car at the weekend

The mother of the 11-year-old boy who was playing in the car told police she did not know her son had taken the keys.

The accident happened just before 4pm on Saturday afternoon outside the Gompers housing complex.

Jay’lah was standing at the edge of the front yard when the car ran over her, police and relatives said.

After the car began to roll from a gravel driveway the boys jumped out of the car to try to help her.

The car rolled into a telephone pole across the street and stopped.

'They panicked,' said family friend Sherwin Haywood, 56, who lives in the housing complex told the Post Dispatch. 'They didn’t know what to do.'

Juvenile detectives were questioning the boys, but Police Chief Michael Floore called the incident an accident

Jay’lah’s grandmother, Elverita Graham, 56, said Jay’lah was visiting her on Saturday as usual. Suddenly she heard her granddaughter screaming outside. She was brought into the house and called 911.

'It was an accident and I don’t want to see them punished,' she said. 'They’re young and they’ve got their whole lives ahead of them. I know they didn’t mean to do it. It’s just a horrible situation for everybody.'

She said she hopes the little girls death teaches the boys a lesson that 'everything has consequences and you have to think before you act.'

'Jay’lah had spirit,' she said. 'If you turned your back on her, she was into something else.'

'When I rocked her to sleep, she would hug on my neck and feel my face,' she said. 'I just loved her. I loved her. While she’s up there with God, I hope he loves her just as much as I did.'

Jay’lah had a 3-month old brother, Jay-lee, and two sisters, Shaniyah Wilson, 8, and Mariyah Keith, 4.

No funeral arrangements have yet been made.
