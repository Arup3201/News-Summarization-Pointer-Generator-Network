Sportsmail cricket writer and Wisden Cricketers' Almanack editor Lawrence Booth looks at why history is against Sri Lanka as they chase an unlikely win on day five at Lord's, how overs are disappearing into the ether and Jimmy Anderson's latest achievement.

Alastair Cook and Angelo Mathews have been spoken to by match referee Andy Pycroft about the abysmal over-rates so far in this Test.

Hurry up: Captains Angelo Mathews (left) and Alastair Cook (right) are responsible for slow over rates

Spectators were deprived of six overs on both Friday and Saturday, while Sunday wasn’t much better, with four more overs disappearing into the ether.

The subject of over-rates is known to greatly concern ICC chief executive Dave Richardson - yet umpires continually fail to hurry the players along.

Wrong room: UKIP's Nigel Farage

A surprise visitor in the media centre was UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who to general puzzlement settled down at a table in the refreshment area.

It turned out he should not have been there at all.

Uninvited by either MCC or the ECB, he had jumped in a lift with a TV crew following what a Lord’s spokesman described as a ‘misunderstanding’ with stewards.

When Jimmy Anderson yorked Rangana Herath in the seventh over of the day, it was his 64th Test wicket at Lord’s, taking him one clear of Fred Trueman.

Only Ian Botham, with 69, now has more.

This is Angelo Mathews’ eighth Test as captain of Sri Lanka and he is wearing the burden of leadership lightly.

His superb 102 took his average while in charge to a monumental 82 - compared to 39 when he was in the ranks.

Only one team have ever made more than England’s 575 for nine declared in the first innings of a Test and gone on to lose.

And that was way back in 1894-95 at Sydney, where Australia contrived to be beaten by England having racked up 586.

England followed on, before nicking the game by 10 runs.

If Sri Lanka are to pull off an unlikely victory, they need to make history.

The highest total to win a Test here was the 344 for one by West Indies in 1984, Gordon Greenidge hammering 214 not out.
