Drunks could be charged for ending up in A&E under proposals being considered in Northern Ireland.

The country’s health minister has said there is ‘merit’ to the fees and they could free-up staff to treat seriously ill patients.

Officials at the Department of Health in England insist there are no plans for charges here but some experts are in favour.

In England last year a total of 1.22 million patients were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries, double the number in 2002/3

Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland’s health minister, said he was concerned about the number of people requiring treatment as a result of their own irresponsible behaviour.

‘The United Kingdom has a great principle of health care, free at the point of need to all who need it irrespective of their ability to pay for it.’ he said

‘I think it is a wonderful principle but I think on occasions it is abused and we sometimes need to look at how we can make sure that abuse doesn't take place.’

Referring to patients being charged if they needed treatment as a result of alcohol or drugs, Mr Poots said: ‘The principle of it has merit.

‘The implementation of it is more challenging.

‘We need to ensure that people who need medical care are not put off receiving that medical care.’

The proposals could see drunks being made to pay a fine every time they went to A&E or having to cover their treatment.

Having your stomach pumped after excess alcohol, for example can cost between £600 and £3,500

In England last year a total of 1.22 million patients were admitted to hospital for alcohol-related illnesses or injuries, double the number in 2002/3.

The NHS now spends £3.5billion a year treating patients for the effects of alcohol, more than twice as much as 2001 when it was just £1.47billion.

In June, senior nurses from the Royal College of Nurses said drunks should be banned from A&E as they divert care from the elderly and other seriously ill patients.

Revellers who burden the NHS after turning up drunk at A&E should be charged, Northern Ireland's health minister Edwin Poots has suggested

Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the RCN, proposed sending them to drunk tanks – rooms or units in city centres – where they could sober up without creating a disturbance in hospital.

He added: 'They say there was a time when this was a Friday or Saturday phenomenon but it's now round-the-week,' he said.

'There's hardly a time when there isn't someone with an alcohol problem in an A&E department.'

Speaking at the RCN's annual conference in Liverpool, he added: 'It's a contemporary problem, more and more people - not just young people, people of all ages, are drinking too much.

'There is no doubt the country has a significant problem.

'We now have the highest rates of liver disease and alcohol-related illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and oesophageal problems.

'People that come in inebriated require a lot of nursing care and that detracts from nurses being able to care for others.

'People are coming in, perhaps they've been in a fight, there's blood everywhere, they're careering around, it can make things very difficult.'

A Department of Health spokesperson: ‘With more than one million alcohol-related hospital admissions in the last year we know too many people are drinking too much and that alcohol places a heavy burden on the NHS in England, costing around £3.5bn every year.

‘There are no plans to charge drunk people to use A&E. However, we have made sure there are powers in place to enable those who abuse staff to be removed.’
