Loic Remy insists Chelsea remain well placed to pursue silverware on four fronts despite a mixed festive period.

Jose Mourinho's team still top the Barclays Premier League but a lead that once numbered eight points has been reeled in by Manchester City, with a draw at Southampton and a 5-3 defeat at Tottenham over Christmas weakening their position.

A 3-0 victory over Watford on Sunday has secured passage into the fourth round of the FA Cup, but it took the second-half arrival of Diego Costa and Willian to ignite a flat performance.

Loic Remy believes Chelsea can win the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup

Remy believes that now Chelsea have negotiated a mini slump, they can continue chasing multiple trophies.

'It will be hard but we want to win every competition. That's where the mentality and quality of the squad can make the difference. Every player has to be ready,' Remy told Standard Sport.

'The mood is really positive. We are still focused on all the targets. Every team will be in trouble at some time and I hope ours is behind us now with the last two games.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho could guide Chelsea to glory on four fronts 

'There is no problem inside the camp, the players are still happy at training. We have shown everyone that we can react after two bad results.

'Was our confidence badly affected by what happened at Tottenham? No. We are still in first and top of the League. We have qualified for the next round of the FA Cup, so there is no point to be negative or anything like that.

'We just try to be a strong squad because a lot of things can happen in the season. We are just focussed on winning games.'
