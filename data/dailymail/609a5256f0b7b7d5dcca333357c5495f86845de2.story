Self pity: Child killer Stuart Hazell wrote letters complaining that he was crying himself to sleep in prison because of the 'nasty stuff' said about him

Child killer Stuart Hazell wrote a series of self-pitying letters from prison, complaining that he was bullied by other inmates and cried himself to sleep as he awaited trial.

In the letters, written to a pen pal before he pleaded guilty to the murder of 12-year-old Tia Sharp, he complains that he cannot get counselling at Belmarsh maximum security jail in South East London.

The 37-year-old, who was jailed for 38 years without parole last week, also proclaims his innocence in the mistake-littered letters and claimed to be a man with a gentle nature who would never hurt a woman.

He wrote: 'I feel like I’m stuck in a bubble, it sounds soft but I even cry myself to sleep.

'Like I said when my cell door closed then I sit and cry, I won’t deny it, it truly hurts when people say nasty stuff about me, but if they knew me as me a bloke who would do anything for anyone it would paint a different picture.'

His letters, published in the Sunday Mirror, also moan that the prison authorities could not offer him any psychiatric support as he was a remand prisoner, while counselling is only for sentenced prisoners - a situation he brands a 'joke'.

Tia's body was found in the attic of the home in New Addington, South London that Hazell shared with Tia's biological grandmother Christine Bicknell, a week after the girl went missing in August last year. 

Hazell suffocated the 12-year-old during a sex attack after months of trawling vile internet pornography sites and filming her as she slept.

Children’s charities demanded tighter 
internet controls and detectives said his obsession with online child 
porn ‘shaped his behaviour’.

Victim: Tia Sharp, 12, was smothered by Hazell. He had previously looked for child porn and had filmed the girl as she slept

Hazell had insisted for nine months that Tia’s death was a ‘tragic accident’.

The father of one claimed she slipped and broke her neck while he was babysitting her at the home he shared with Miss Bicknell.

But in the letters he claims he would never have hurt a child or hit a woman, claiming he himself had suffered physical abuse as a child.

He added: 'I
 am a loveing, careing, generous bloke who would do anything for anyone 
and I would go out of my way to help friends and family anyway I could.'

Hazell initally claimed Tia's death was a tragic accident. He changed his plea to guilty during the trial

He also compares himself to Robert Stroud - the famous 'Birdman of Alcatraz' - after he befriended a pigeon outside his cell window.

Stroud, a convicted killer, kept hundreds of canaries in his sell and even wrote books about them. He was portrayed by Burt Lancaster in a 1962 film.

Hazell wrote: 'Strange how something so small can take my mind of the cayos (chaos) and madness and this last ten months have been full of cayos and madness believe me.'

The letters also mention his love of football club Tottenham Hotspur, Wasps rugby club and TV shows Scrubs, Hollyoaks and How I Met Your Mother.

Hazell’s criminal past included convictions for racially aggravated common assault in 2002, dealing cocaine in 2003 and possession of a machete in a public place in 2010, for which he was jailed for 12 months.

Tia's Father Steven Carter punches the air as he leaves court after the sentence

He also has convictions for burglary and theft.

Steve Carter, Tia's father, last week called for his daughter's killer to be hung. He said: ‘The four days of trial here were very hard to deal with, hearing the vile things Hazell did to Tia.

'He should serve his time and then be hung.

‘I do not see today’s events as justice for Tia, merely a legal conviction.’

Hazell also wrote to his father Keith from Belmarsh in August last year, saying he had made 'one mistake and my whole world has collapsed'.

He told his father that he wishes he could 'turn back the clock' and that he was unable to eat or sleep in prison.

The letter had two pictures of sad faces drawn on it and had two words written at the top: 'Forgive me'.

Stuart Hazell's letter to his father

Guilty: Stuart Hazell

Dear Dad,

I
 know I am probably the last person you want to hear from but everything
 in papers ain't true, they twist and make their own s*** up.

What
 happened I will explain in time but put it this way, it was an accident
 and I panicked. Stupid I know but for my stupidity I'm looking at 15 to
 18 years.

I regret it every second of every day and there's nothing I can do about it.

I think about taking my own life because if I don't someone will, that is a definite.

I'm classed a Cat A prisoner, never thought this would ever happen.

I hope you're not getting agro because of me, you know I'm not the bad person everyone's saying.

I can't sleep can't eat I wish I could turn back the clock but I can't.

I'm sorry to of lied to you all but I didn't know what to do.

I understand if you rip this up and never want to know me again, I wouldn't blame you.

Christine got arrested, she had nothing to do with this. I loved her with all my heart and sole.

God
 I hate myself. I should of gone about this a different way, told the 
police everything. They're trying to say it was sexual but I promise you
 it wasn't.

It was an accident and I was a p**** to do what I done.

If
 I had the chance I would end it here and now, I got no money, no fags, 
no hope. It's the Hazell curse and I only got myself to blame.

And that will stick with me till my time comes which won't be long.

I
 just want you to know I love you all, I know Christine and family will 
never forgive me, I know what's coming and I deserve it.

I
 want to ask you one favour and one favour only. Send me a little bit of
 money in and I will never ask anything of you again, 1 mistake and my 
whole world has collapsed.

My own fault I know but don't listen to the papers, like everyone else. I will tell you in time.

I love you all, no doubt you will hear I'm on Old Bailey soon.

Tell Sarah and Marc and kids I'm sorry, and Mum Darren and family.

May god have mercy on my sole even thought I don't deserve it.

Love always

Your son

Stuart xxx

I'm sorry truly, truly sorry
