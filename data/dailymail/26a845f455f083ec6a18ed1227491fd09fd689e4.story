Arizona has become one of the first states to ditch Michelle Obama's healthy eating plan when it comes to school fundraisers, after snow cones didn't meet the set standards.

The recently introduced Smart Snacks provision of the Healthy,Hunger-Free Kids Act, forbids sugary and fatty foods from being sold on campus.

However, Arizona schools chief Diane Douglas has granted an exception for the patch she manages, calling the regulations 'ridiculous'. 

Her outrage stemmed from an incident where school children were told they could not sell snow cones because they were not on a list of snacks approved by the federal government.

Under the Obama-endorsed guidelines - enforced on July 1 2014 - any food sold in schools must be a 'whole grain-rich' grain product and have a fruit, vegetable, dairy product, or protein as the primary ingredient.

Snack-size items must contain less than 200 calories and less that 230mg of salt.

The federal rules don't apply to food that is intended to be consumed at home or outside of school - so kids can still sell fundraiser mainstays like frozen pizza, frozen cookie dough and chocolate bars. 

Commenting on the Smart Snack initiative, Douglas told the Arizona Daily Star: 'Forcing parents and other supporters of schools to only offer federally approved food and snacks at fundraisers is a perfect example of the overreach of government and intrusion into local control.

'I have ordered effective immediately that the ADE Health and Nutrition Services division grant exemptions for all fundraisers for both traditional public schools and charter public schools.'

South Carolina schools have also partially lifted the ban on junk food after districts argued that it was hampering the ability of volunteer groups to raise money for activities like field trips. 

Despite the backlash, many schools say they have been successful in ditching the unhealthier models.

In Dallas, physical education teacher Sharon Foster says her school, James Bowie Elementary, stopped selling chocolate bars and started selling Y-Ties - elastic shoe laces that don't have to be tied. 

Parent Susan Fox Pinkowitz said she helped her children's elementary school, University Park Elementary in Denver, move from a candy-filled annual carnival to a fun run and carnival that offers apples and protein nut bars. 

Cake's off the menu: The Smart Snacks provision of the Healthy,Hunger-Free Kids Act, which was introduced last July, forbids sugary and fatty foods from being sold on campus.

She said the new fundraiser brings in as much as $12,000 annually, three or four times the amount raised by the old event. 

The federal rules allow states to seek exemptions for an 'infrequent' number of fundraisers, but fewer than half have asked for them, according to the National Association of State Boards of Education.  

Kristen Amundson, the association's director, says the group has been asking state boards to give careful thought to whether they need to seek exemptions.

'Do you really want a bake sale every day, 180 days a year?' Amundson said. 'Maybe, but probably not.'

The idea is to prevent frequent junk-food fundraisers that fill kids up and divert them - and their dollars - from healthier foods in the cafeteria and elsewhere in school. 

Congress passed the fundraiser standards in 2010, and they are part of a larger government effort championed by first lady Michelle Obama to make all foods sold in schools healthier.
