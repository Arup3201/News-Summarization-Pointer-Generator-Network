Travellers appear to be warming up to Ryanair’s effort to revamp its image as the airline announced Thursday that it is expecting more passengers and higher profits than originally forecast this fiscal year.

Europe’s largest budget airline has long been criticised for its surcharges and customer service, but it has softened its stance on baggage charges and booking conditions and introduced allocated seating and a new business class service in a bid to win over passengers.

Michael O’Leary, the controversial chief executive of the Dublin-based airline, informed shareholders Thursday that Ryanair now expects to fly 87 million customers in the year to 31 March, an increase of one million from the previous forecast.

Mr O’Leary, who revealed that he is nearing a deal to remain chief executive for another five years, also raised the no-frills airline’s full year net profit towards the upper end of its previously guided range of £484m to £507m.

He said in a statement: ‘Our customers and shareholders have responded favourably to our improving customer experience, our better digital platform and the positive initial uptake of our Business Plus Service.’ 

He said the airline expects ‘slightly stronger traffic growth’ this winter with new bases in primary airports in Cologne, Gdansk, Glasgow and Warsaw (Modlin).

Ryanair has also announced plans to increase its flight frequencies and schedules from Dublin to UK cities and European capitals.

But Mr O'Leary warned there was still uncertainty over the full-year performance due to little visibility on fare yields in the October to March period.

Ryanair's post-tax profits were 8 per cent lower at £408m in the year to 31 March after a price war left average fares 4 per cent lower at a time of rising fuel costs.

After announcing a deal with Spain’s Amadeus on Wednesday, Mr O’Leary suggested that Ryanair and other budget carriers could become feeder airlines for legacy airlines such as Lufthansa in the future.

He believes low-cost airlines could fill in the gap as legacy airlines increasingly focus on long-haul routes amid competition from rival Gulf airlines such as Etihad and Emirates

Earlier this month, Ryanair announced that it has agreed to purchase up to 200 new Boeing 737 Max 200 passenger jets in a deal worth as much as £22bn.

Ryanair said the more-efficient planes will allow it to carry more passengers, fly to new markets and trim its operating costs.
