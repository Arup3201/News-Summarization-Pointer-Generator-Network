The group stage is over, and it's as good a time as any to take a breather and reflect on what we have seen so far at the World Cup.

16 of the 32 teams that began in Brazil just over two weeks ago have exited stage left, with world champions Spain, Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal and perennially underwhelming England those to have already fallen.

And for every shock knockout, there's been an even more surprising progression. Costa Rica managed to make it through a group featuring Italy, England and Uruguay, Greece snuck through with just two goals in the 'for' column and Algeria made it past Fabio Capello's Russia to qualify from the group stage for the first time in their history..

So time to assess, who have been the best players so far? Here, Sportsmail - with a little help from Opta - take a look at the 11 men who have stood head and shoulders above the rest during the first 48 games...

Vincent Enyeama - Nigeria

Has done superbly in goal as Nigeria made it through Group F in second place behind Argentina - keeping clean sheets in their opening two games against Iran and Bosnia & Herzegovina. It took the magic of Lionel Messi to beat him.   

Opta verdict: Has made 18 saves, more than any other goalkeeper in the tournament.

Stopper: Vincent Enyeama has been a rock in goal

Gary Medel - Chile

The little general has been a rock in the heart of Chile's defence. His towering display during Chile's 2-0 victory over Spain was simply marvellous.   

Opta verdict: 28 clearances and a 93% pass completion for the diminutive Chilean defender (from 207 passes).

Little general: Gary Medel has been superb at the back for Chile so far

Daniel van Buyten - Belgium

The veteran defender has been masterful at the back as Belgium won all three of their Group H games. Tough defending was required with all their victories coming by just a single goal.   

Opta verdict: No player made more blocks than van Buyten in the group stage (5).

Nutter: Daniel Van Buyten goes up for a header against South Korea forward Kim Shin-Wook

Rafael Marquez - Mexico

Captaining your country at four World Cups should be enough, but it also helped that Marquez was superb in his role at the heart of defence in all three games. Mexico conceded just the one goal in three games, and managed to keep Neymar and Brazil at bay.    

Opta verdict: Veteran Rafael Márquez has netted a goal for Mexico in each of the last three World Cups.

Captain Marvel: Rafael Marquez is captaining Mexico at his fourth World Cup

Per Mertesacker - Germany 

To think that at Euro 2012 two years ago Mertesacker wasn't even in the Germany side. A superb presence in defence alongside Mats Hummels.  

Opta verdict: Of all defenders to feature in the group stages, only Gary Medel (207) attempted more passes than Per Mertesacker (202).

BFG: Per Mertesacker has been excellent has Germany qualified from Group G

James Rodriguez - Colombia

Quite possibly the standout player of the tournament so far. Has been at the heart of everything good Colombia have done during their 100% group stage record, scoring three times in the process. 

Opta verdict: Has scored or assisted a goal every 45 minutes on average, the best rate of any player to play more than 100 minutes at this tournament.

Spark: James Rodriguez has been superb in a central role for Colombia

Juan Guillermo Cuadrado - Colombia   

Freed on the wing by Jose Pekerman's decision to start the World Cup with just a single striker, Cuadrado has been an electric creative presence so far as Colombia dominated Group C.

Opta verdict: Has already provided three assists, the joint-most with Holland's Daley Blind.

Electric: Juan Cuadrado pace has been a virtue for Colombia

Arjen Robben - Holland

The new fastest man in the world - or at least in the football world - Robben's performance against Spain in their opening game will be remembered for a long time.   

Opta verdict: After scoring once in 2006 and twice in 2010, has already netted three goals in the 2014 tournament (plus one assist)

Sprinter: Arjen Robben scored three times as Holland topped Group B

Karim Benzema - France

Benzema has led the line superbly for France, keeping Olivier Giroud out out of the team for two of their games and scoring three goals. How it is still only three, mind, only he will know.

Opta verdict: Created 12 goalscoring chances (including assists), the joint-most with Miralem Pjanic, plus he has netted three times.

Finisher: Karim Benzema led the line as France dominated Group E

Lionel Messi - Argentina

It's hard to say anything about Messi that hasn't already been said. So best to keep it simple: four goals so far, all of them superb, all of them vital.    

Opta verdict: Has scored three goals from outside the box, two more than any other player.

Maestro: Lionel Messi has scored four times in three games as Argentina cruised through to the second phase

Neymar - Brazil

The poster boy of Brazil and the man with the weight of a nation on his shoulders. Neymar could so easily have crumbled, but he hasn't even come close yet. Four goals so far, and you'd imagine there are plenty more to come.    

Opta verdict: Four goal hero Neymar has the best conversion rate of any player to have attempted at least eight shots (44.44%).

Poster boy: Brazil's golden boy has rised to the plate, scoring four times during the group stage

Substitutes

Alexander Dominguez - Ecuador   

Opta verdict: His saves to shots rate of 85% is second only to Nigeria's Enyeama.

Sergei Ignashevich - Russia   

Opta verdict: Made more headed clearances than any other player in the group stage (30).

Xherdan Shaqiri - Switzerland   

Opta verdict: Scored the first entirely left-footed hat-trick at a World Cup (1966-2014).

Thomas Muller - Germany   

Opta verdict: Has scored nine goals in his first nine World Cup games, matching Pele's achievement.
