The general consensus up until the late 20th century was that after Earth’s formation 4.54 billion years ago, the planet was a hellish place covered in magma.

But now scientists say conditions on Earth for the first 500 million years after it formed may have been surprisingly similar to the present day complete with oceans and even continents.

Researchers say that ancient rocks in Iceland indicate that early Earth had a more moderate temperature and was more hospitable than thought.

Researchers at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee say that the young Earth (pictured from space on the ISS in 2007) might not have been inhospitable to life. It had been thought that in its first 500 million years after its formation 4.54 billion years ago our planet was covered in magma and was a hellish place

The study was conducted by a team of geologists from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.

They examined a long-standing theory that modern Iceland is an analogue of the early Earth.

Previously it had been thought that Iceland’s crust, which formed from magma that is much hotter than anywhere else on the planet, was similar to Earth’s in its first 500 million years.

However in the study the researchers examined zircons - crystals that have existed almost since Earth’s formation - in Iceland.

The first 500 million years of the Earth's life are known as the Hadean Eon.

Although this time amounts to more than 10 percent of Earth's history, little is known about it, since few rocks are known that are older than 3.8 billion years old.

For much of the Hadean, Earth and its sister worlds in the inner solar system were pummeled with an extraordinary number of cosmic impacts. 

And they found that while the zircons on Iceland were indicative of a hot formation, they did not match the composition of zircons found elsewhere on Earth.

This suggest that Iceland is not a model for the young Earth - and instead Earth 4 billion years ago was not as hellish as thought.

‘We discovered that Icelandic zircons are quite distinctive from crystals formed in other locations on modern Earth,’ explained Vanderbilt doctoral student Tamara Carley who was part of the study.

‘We also found that they formed in magmas that are remarkably different from those in which the Hadean zircons grew.’

Analysis of zircon crystals - remants of the ancient Earth - in Iceland suggests our planet was hospitable early in its formation. Shown are images of a collection of Icelandic zircons taken with a scanning electron microscope. They range in size from a tenth of a millimeter to a few thousandths of a millimeter

The researchers found that while zircons on Iceland grew from hot magma, they did not match zircons found elsewhere on Earth, suggesting Iceland was not an analogue of the young Earth. Pictured is Professor Miller, who led the study, at the Kerlingarfjoll volcano in central Iceland

Carley collected samples from volcanoes and sands derived from the erosion of Icelandic volcanoes.

She separated thousands of zircon crystals from the samples, which cover the island's regional diversity and represent its 18 million year history.

Together with other scientists she analysed about 1,000 zircon crystals for their age and elemental isotopic compositions.

Most importantly, their analysis found that Icelandic zircons grew from much hotter magmas than Hadean zircons.

Although surface water played an important role in the generation of both Icelandic and Hadean crystals, in the Icelandic case the water was extremely hot when it interacted with the source rocks.

By comparison, the Hadean water-rock interactions were at significantly lower temperatures.

‘Our conclusion is counterintuitive,’ said Professor Calvin Miller, who led the study.

‘Hadean zircons grew from magmas rather similar to those formed in modern subduction zones, but apparently even "cooler" and "wetter" than those being produced today.’

The researchers would suggest Iceland is not an analogue of Earth, and instead our young planet may have had more moderate temperatures as opposed to being a hellish place as shown in this illustration. This means that in its first 500 million years continents and even oceans could have formed on the surface of Earth

But analysis of zircon crystals in Iceland suggests this is not the case

@highlight

Zircons are ancient remnants of Earth left over from its formation

Scientists had thought Iceland was an analogue of early Earth owing to its crust being hotter than elsewhere on the planet
