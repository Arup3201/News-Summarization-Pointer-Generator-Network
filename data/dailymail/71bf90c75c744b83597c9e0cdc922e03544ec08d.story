The tradition of lower-league sides celebrating drawing a big club has been long associated with the FA Cup, but Spanish minnows Huesca have taken the rejoicing to a new level as the team's players jumped up and down wildly after being paired with Barcelona in the Copa del Rey.

Huesca, based in the north east of the country in Aragon, play in the third tier of Spanish football and will take on the Catalan giants in the fourth round of the cup competition.

The opportunity to test themselves against one of the best teams in the world prompted Huesca's players to hug each other and shout with joy in celebrations that resembled those of players who have  just won a tournament.

The Spanish minnows play in Spanish football's third tier but will travel to the Nou Camp for a dream fixture

Huesca beat fellow third tier side Barakaldo in the previous round of the cup to earn the tie against Barca

The tie will be played over two legs, with the first match played at Huesca's 5,500-capacity Estadio El Alcoraz on December 3.

The minnows will then travel to Barcelona on December 17 for the second leg at the Nou Camp, one of the most famous stadiums in world football. 

The challenge facing Huesca could hardly be more daunting - Barca are currently top of La Liga and have not conceded a single goal in their first eight league games. 

The two-legged clash will see Huesca's players testing themselves against stars like Neymar and Lionel Messi

Table-topping Barca are in scintillating form and beat Eibar 3-0 on Saturday, including this strike from Xavi
