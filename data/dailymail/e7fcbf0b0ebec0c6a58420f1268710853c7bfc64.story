A mother-of-two learnt that her husband of six-years had collapsed and died after a police officer called her mobile while she was at work. 

David Williams, 35, passed away after suffering a massive asthma attack at a neighbour's house.

His wife, Ruth, was unaware of his death until she received the call from the North Wales Police officer and initially dismissed it as a 'sick joke.'

The 32-year-old later complained to the force and the unnamed police constable has received a final written warning for his behaviour, that was branded 'wholly inappropriate' and 'unacceptable.'

North Wales Police defended the actions of the officer at the time saying that he had been 'forced reluctantly' to break the news when he answered a call on Mr Williams' mobile phone.

But after an investigation police chiefs admitted that the officer had in fact phoned Mrs Williams on her mobile.

Superintendent Peter Newton said: 'It is not the usual practice of North Wales Police to inform a next of kin of death by telephone.

'In the circumstances this was a wholly inappropriate and unacceptable way to inform Mrs Williams of her husband's death and both the Force and the officer concerned have apologised to her.'

The officer involved has received a final written warning.

Mr Williams, 35, who has young daughters with his wife, died from a severe asthma attack.

Mrs Williams had been working at The Golden Fleece pub near her home in Tremadog, North Wales, when her husband collapsed at a neighbour's house.

She said: 'I was doing a shift at the Fleece and my mobile rang, which I'd left behind the bar.

'It was a number I didn't recognise and I'd missed the call as I was serving a customer.

'I rang the number back off the work phone and the man introduced himself as a police officer.

'He asked me if I was with Dave, and I said to him, 'no, I'm at work and he's at home'.

'But then he said: 'are you in a relationship still?' I said 'of course, I'm his wife'.

'He then told me that Dave had died. I thought it was a joke what he was saying, I swore at him and threw the phone to my friend and work colleague who spoke to him. I thought it was a sick joke

'I just wish they had come to tell me in person, it would have made it easier.'

Local councillor Alwyn Gruffydd, said: 'I'm disgusted at the police and how they informed Ruth of her husband's death. This is not the way to deal with it.'
