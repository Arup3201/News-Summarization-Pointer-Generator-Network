After demolishing Denis Bakhtov inside four minutes, Anthony Joshua hit London nightclub Boujis in celebration of his commanding WBC International heavyweight win.

The 24-year-old was beaming with delight upon entering the South Kensington venue on Sunday night, as he continues to bask in his glory against Bakhtov.

Built as a testing fight for the Watford fighter pre-bout, Joshua battered his veteran opponent inside two rounds at London's O2 Arena on Saturday.

The emphatic triumph now sees the Olympic champion's record read at nine wins out of nine in his first year since turning professional.

Bakhtov had not been stopped for almost a decade and had boxed a staggering 250 rounds more than his younger opponent, but that didn't look the case as the fight came to a quick conclusion.

Despite the ease of the outcome Joshua, who will fight Michael Sprott in six weeks time in Liverpool, says he won't get carried away by his performance.

‘I need to put this behind me,’ he said after the fight.

‘Not everyone will get knocked out like that, not everyone will fold under pressure. There’s a whole ocean of heavyweights out there,’ he added.

‘There’s been a long line of heavyweights and there’s always two or three that rise to the top. I’ve got the potential but I’ve got to graft and grind to bring that dream to a reality.’
