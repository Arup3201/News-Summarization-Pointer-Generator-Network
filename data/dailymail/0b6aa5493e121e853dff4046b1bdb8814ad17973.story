Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has poured his heart out on social media to pay respect to his best mate Phillip Hughes who sadly would have turned 26 yesterday.

Clarke was sitting up with a drink in hand on Saturday night ready to raise his glass to Hughes when the clock struck midnight.

So close that they called each other brothers, Clarke was counting down on Twitter asking others to join him in paying tribute to the much-loved cricketer.
