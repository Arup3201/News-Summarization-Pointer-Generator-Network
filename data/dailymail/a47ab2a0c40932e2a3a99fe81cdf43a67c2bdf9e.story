The UK's most senior police officer has said a terror attack in Britain is unlikely despite reports that the country is on the brink of raising the threat level to its highest in seven years.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said an attack was possible but called for the public to remain calm in the wake of the Paris terror attacks.

He told Sky News: 'I don't think it's likely but I think we all know it's a possibility - the threat level is severe and so therefore that means a terrorist attack is possible.

Claim: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said an attack was possible but unlikely 

'We do our best together with the security services to make sure the terrorists don't succeed and that we keep people safe. To date, that's broadly what we've been able to achieve.'

Britain's threat level was raised from 'substantial' to 'severe' in August last year following the gains made by Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

The Sunday Times today quoted senior security sources who warned that Britain is poised to raise the terrorist threat level to 'critical' - the highest category.

A 'critical' threat level means that a terrorist attack is expected imminently, while with 'severe' it is highly likely and 'moderate' means an attack is possible but unlikely.

The last time it was at 'critical' was in June 2007 following failed terrorist attacks at Glasgow airport and in London.

Claims that the threat level may be raised again come amid fears that Islamist militants are planning a terrorist 'spectacular' in the West.

Andrew Parker, the head of MI5, said on Friday that a group of core al Qaida terrorists in Syria is planning 'mass casualty attacks' against Western targets.

He also stated that a terror attack in Britain is 'highly likely'.

Aviation bomb plots and Mumbai-style shootings in crowded places are thought to be among plans being developed by the shadowy 'Khorasan' cell, which has Britain among its sights.

In the UK, and across Europe, debate rages over the best methods to address and tackle extremist views.

In Britain, a programme called Channel exists to counter the ideology of Islamism and deradicalise young Muslims who are considered at risk of extremism. 

Tribute: Thousands of people began filled France's Place de la République as world leaders converged on Paris in a rally of defiance and sorrow today

World leaders attending the march in Paris today included (L-R) Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz

By March last year, almost 4,000 people, 1,450 children among them, had been referred for possible inclusion to the programme, an increase of 70 per cent since 2013, The Telegraph reports. 

A total of 777 people considered at risk of terrorism had been introduced to Channel since it was founded, and the service is managing 'at least 300' active cases, according to providers.

These include young people who have been intercepted at airports attempting to fly to Syria, others whose siblings or friends have travelled to the country, people radicalised in prison and even schoolchildren.
