A number of former soldiers have spoken out against the move because of the tough logistical life of fighters on the front line, even though many outsiders see Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's decision to lift the ban on women serving in combat positions as a progressive move.

Some have spoken out about how the move ignores some of the realities of war, like disgusting unhygienic conditions and the way that soldiers are sometimes forced to change in front of one another, in favor of gender equality.

One wrote a letter in the Wall Street Journal describing the conditions he faced on the front line when he was involved in the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003.

Fully integrated: The removal of the ban that will allow women to serve on the front line has been met with criticism from some former soldiers who believe that the close quarters of war may prove challenging

‘Many Marines developed dysentery from the complete lack of sanitary conditions. When an uncontrollable urge hit a Marine, he would be forced to stand, as best he could, hold an MRE bag up to his rear, and defecate inches from his seated comrade's face,’ Ryan Smith wrote in the opinion piece.

He went on to say that they were unable to change out of their chemical protective suits for nearly a month, and once they secured Baghdad, they finally changed out of the suits which were caked in blood and human filth at that point.

‘My unit stood there in a walled-in 
compound in Baghdad, naked, sores dotted all over our bodies, feet 
peeling, watching our suits burn. Later, they lined us up naked and 
washed us off with pressure washers,’ he wrote.

Welcoming: Mr Panetta said that women play an integral role in the combat mission

The
 historic change, which was recommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
overturns a 1994 rule prohibiting women from being assigned to smaller 
ground combat units.

It will
 be up to the military service chiefs to recommend and defend whether 
women should be excluded from any of those more demanding and deadly 
positions, such as Navy SEALs or the Army's Delta Force. The services 
will have until January 2016 to make a case to that some positions 
should remain closed to women.

The change won't take place overnight: 
Service chiefs will have to develop plans for allowing women to seek the
 combat positions, a senior military official said.

Some jobs may open as soon as this year, while assessments for others, such as special operations forces, may take longer.

Some insiders remain hesitant about the move, saying that while it may seem progressive to incorporate all, it may not be the most efficient way to run an army.

'Every female troop I know (over the 
age of 25) says publicly, "Sure, open them up!" And privately, "But not 
for me personally. I know I don't have the brute strength required and I
 would be crushed to let down my colleagues -- so, no way, no thanks,"' 
an anonymous female Army officer told ABC News.

Women's rights advocates say that concerns about female soldiers urinating or dealing with menstrual cycles while on the front lines are problems that have already been addressed.

Nancy Duff Campbell, the co-president of the National Women's Law Center, told MailOnline that female soldiers already undergo a specific training course dedicated to discussing gender-specific hygiene issues.

As a result, many use a tool called a Female Urinary Diversion Device (which effectively has a small tube that runs down one's pant leg) would allow women to urinate into a container if they were kept in a tank for a long period of time.

They also cover a number of ways to address their menstrual cycles by either taking daily menstruation suppressant pills.

'This isn't something new; part of this is a response to what has been going on for a long time,' Ms Duff Campbell said.

'I'm not particularly concerned about
 the hygienic concerns. There might be privacy concerns that you'd like 
to have but you cant have in a battle environment.'

There long has been opposition to putting
 women in combat, based on questions of whether they have the necessary 
strength and stamina for certain jobs, or whether their presence might 
hurt unit cohesion.

But as news of Panetta's expected order 
got out, many members of Congress, including the Senate Armed Services 
Committee chairman, Democratic Senator Carl Levin announced their 
support.

‘It reflects the reality of 21st century military operations,’ Levin said.

Objections were few. Jerry Boykin, executive vice president of the Family Research Council, called the move ‘another social experiment’ that will place unnecessary burdens on military commanders.

‘While their focus must remain on winning the battles and protecting their troops, they will now have the distraction of having to provide some separation of the genders during fast moving and deadly situations,’ said Boykin, a retired Army lieutenant general.

He noted that small units often are in sustained combat for extended periods of time under primal living conditions with no privacy.

Panetta's move comes in his final 
weeks as Pentagon chief and just days after President Barack Obama's 
inaugural speech in which he spoke passionately about equal rights for 
all.

The new order expands 
the department's action of nearly a year ago to open about 14,500 combat
 positions to women, nearly all of them in the Army.

Support: United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice expressed her support for the measure

Changing qualifications: Senior defense officials say Pentagon chief Leon Panetta is removing the military's ban on women serving in combat

In an afternoon press conference confirming the news alongside Joint Chiefs chairman General Martin Dempsey, Mr Panetta said that not everyone can meet the qualifications to be a combat soldier. But, he said, everyone is entitled to the chance.

He said the qualifications will not be reduced, and with women playing a broader role, the military will be strengthened.

Former prisoner of war Jessica Lynch calls it good news for the U.S. military that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says women can serve in combat roles.

The West Virginia resident says women have long been integral to victories in the fight for freedom. Lynch was 19 when she was captured after her Army unit took a wrong turn and came under attack in Iraq in 2003. She was rescued after nine days in captivity.

Lynch urges Americans to support military men and women, and to push U.S. officials to ensure they have proper training and equipment.

In addition to questions of strength 
and performance, there also have been suggestions that the American 
public would not tolerate large numbers of women being killed in war.

Under
 the 1994 Pentagon policy, women were prohibited from being assigned to 
ground combat units below the brigade level. A brigade is roughly 3,500 
troops split into several battalions of about 800 soldiers each.

On the front lines: The move lifts a ban that was put in place in 1994

Historically, brigades were based farther from the front lines, and they often included top command and support staff.

The
 necessities of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, propelled women
 into jobs as medics, military police and intelligence officers that 
were sometimes attached — but not formally assigned — to battalions.

Problem solver: The inclusion of women is believed it may help decrease the ever-growing number of problems within the military, like sexual harassment and sexual assaults

So while a woman couldn't be assigned as an infantryman in a battalion going out on patrol, she could fly the helicopter supporting the unit, or move in to provide medical aid if troops were injured.

And these conflicts, where battlefield
 lines are blurred and insurgents can lurk around every corner, have 
made it almost impossible to keep women clear of combat.

Still,
 as recent surveys and experiences have shown, it will not be an easy 
transition. When the Marine Corps sought women to go through its tough 
infantry course last year, two volunteered and both failed to complete 
the course. And there may not be a wide clamoring from women for the 
more intense, dangerous and difficult jobs, including some infantry and 
commando positions.

'I know,
 you still hear: "It’s a man’s military." But we are all service 
members,' Terri Kaas, an Air Force veteran who served in Germany and 
Bahrain, told The Today Show.

'Look
 at the Marine Corps — they have equal standards of fitness for both 
genders. If the men can’t respect women for the job they’re doing maybe 
these men shouldn’t be in the military.'

Two
 lawsuits were filed last year challenging the Pentagon's ban on women 
serving in combat, adding pressure on officials to overturn the policy.

Military services have been studying the issue and surveying their forces to determine how it may affect performance and morale.

The Joint Chiefs have been meeting regularly on the matter and they unanimously agreed to send the recommendation to Panetta earlier this month.

A senior military official familiar with the discussions said the chiefs laid out three main principles to guide them as they move through the process.

Those were to maintain America's effective fighting force, preserve military readiness and develop a process that would give all service members the best chance to succeed.

Women comprise about 14 per cent of the 1.4 million active military personnel.

More than 280,000 women have been sent to Iraq, Afghanistan or to jobs in neighboring nations in support of the wars. Of the more than 6,600 U.S. service members who have been killed, 152 have been women.

The senior military official said the military chiefs must report back to Panetta with their initial implementation plans by May 15.
