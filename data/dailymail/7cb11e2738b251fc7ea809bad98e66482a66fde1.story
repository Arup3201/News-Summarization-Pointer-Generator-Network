It was supposed to be his Agincourt moment - a speech to 20,000 adoring supporters which would seal his deal with the French electorate.

But the left-wing frontrunner in the presidential race has been left a laughing stock, after his high-brow attempt to quote William Shakespeare spectacularly backfired.

Francois Hollande thought he was citing a little-known passage of The Bard when, lapping up the applause, he said: 'And I will quote Shakespeare, who recalls this universal law, they failed because they did not start with a dream.'

But he was in fact quoting current British author Nicholas Shakespeare - from his 1989 fictional novel The Vision of Elena Silves about a Marxist terrorist.

Red-faced Hollande may be left wing, but has now been mocked for taking his ideology a step too far by invoking the book's hero, Gabriel.

A Maoist revolutionary, he ends up a terrorist for the murderous Peruvian guerrilla group, Shining Path.

The group's motto was 'Marxism – Leninism will open the shining path to revolution'.

Nicholas Shakespeare, 54, who is a direct descendant of William's grandfather, said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the French presidential candidate had quoted me.'

But he added: 'I was really pleased to see how the quote remains fresh.

'It can apply to anything and I think it's rather good it's applying to a presidential campaign. You don't need to be Marxist to want a better society.'

Of his character's quote, he told the Telegraph: 'He is saying the last Marxist revolution of the Sixties had failed.

'But his is going to succeed and the idea is that they failed because they did not have a dream.'

The book has been translated into more than 10 languages, and won critical acclaim when it was released in France in 1991 with the publisher Albin Michel.

President: Nicolas Sarkozy is lagging in the polls

Hollande has been ridiculed for his faux pas in Le Bourget outside Paris on Sunday.

The right-wing UMP camp, which is backing the embattled Nicolas Sarkozy, is expected to seize on it as a sign he is not the 'reconstructed' left-winged as he likes to be portrayed.

The rest of the rally, where he said he would raise taxes on banks, big firms and the rich to wipe out the public deficit,  has been hailed a success by the left.

He also said he would pump more funds into education and state-aided job creation if he wins power in May.         

Hollande, tipped in polls to unseat Sarkozy and become France's first Socialist president in 17 years, promised to spend 20 billion euros on hiring 60,000 extra schooling staff and police, to help start-ups and small companies and create 150,000 state-aided jobs.    

He also vowed to lean hardest on the country's wealthiest as well as its biggest companies and the banking industry to drum up the lion's share of another 29 billion euros needed to cut the national deficit to zero by the end of 2017.     

The 57-year-old said: 'The vast majority of the French people will not be called on to make additional sacrifices.

'If there are sacrifices to be made, and there will be, then it will be for the wealthiest to make them.'

He pledged to reduce France's large deficit to zero by the end of 2017, a year later than Sarkozy's conservative government, with 17 of the 29 billion euros needed coming from company tax and the rest from households, primarily the richest ones.
