Arsenal superstar Alexis Sanchez has revealed he is looking forward to welcoming his 'good friend' Neymar to the Emirates Stadium when Chile face Brazil on March 29.

The all-South American friendly match will see Brazil come up against Chile for the first time since their 2014 World Cup last 16 clash.

Neymar got the better of his former Barcelona team-mate Sanchez on that occasion as Brazil progressed to the quarter-finals by defeating their opponents on penalties.

Sanchez, who scored for Chile in their 1-1 draw with Brazil before their elimination from the tournament, will be hoping to exact revenge against last year's World Cup hosts in what he has described as a 'special' game.

Speaking ahead of the glamour friendly, Sanchez said: 'I’m so excited and honoured to be playing for the national team of Chile, against our great rivals Brazil, in front of the incredible Arsenal fans at Emirates Stadium.

'I also look forward to playing against my good friend Neymar and welcoming him and the rest of the Brazil team to Emirates Stadium in March.

'Matches between Brazil and Chile are always exciting encounters, and for me, to play this game at Emirates Stadium will make the match even more special.'
