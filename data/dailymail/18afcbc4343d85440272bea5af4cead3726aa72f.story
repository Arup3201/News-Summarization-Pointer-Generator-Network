Officials have banned Christmas lights from a busy High Street for the first time in 20 years unless traders fork out up to £4,000 to have lampposts tested for health and safety reasons.

Furious residents and local business owners have slammed a new rule which means the West Wickham Town Centre Association must pay for test certificates to ensure lampposts are strong enough to support Christmas lights.

The charge was introduced after the High Street was designated a red route, meaning it is managed by Transport for London (TfL) rather than Bromley Council.

Unseasonal: West Wickham High Street could be without its Christmas lights this year

As one of London’s major roads, the High Street carries up to 30 per cent of city traffic.

Secretary of the association Jane Avis manages the family-run shop Waterways, in the High Street, which has been running for more 30 years.

She said: 'We’ve had Christmas lights for over 20 years. My mum used to do it and then I took it over.

'It doesn’t make a massive difference to trade, it just gives a good community feeling.

'West Wickham High Street has been a red route for four or five years and they never asked for anything.

'But last year they said we need to comply with regulations which are different to Bromley Council’s.

'We’re going to fight them all the way. We won’t let them dampen our Christmas spirits.'

Resident Charles Sebestyen, a 70-year-old
retired property executive who has lived in the area for around 35 
years, said: 'It has killed the Christmas spirit in the West Wickham 
area.

'TfL is being ridiculous. I simply do not understand how something that has worked for a long time is now suddenly unsafe.'

Mr Sebestyen, a member of West Wickham Residents’ Association, added: 'It’s just sad because in this economic climate, the traders can’t afford it.

'David Cameron talks about the big society where people do something for themselves and this is what happens.'

Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'With money tight councils don’t have a fortune to spend on Christmas lights.

'Bureaucrats shouldn't be making it more expensive to decorate town centres with some Christmas cheer.

Tradition: West Wickham residents hope they will soon put up their own festive street decorations

'If traders and residents are willing to invest in their community’s festive celebrations then authorities should support that, not get in the way with needless red tape and bureaucracy.'

TfL director of roads Dana Skelley 
said: 'Safety on our road network is the top priority and any additional
attachments to a lighting column on our road network have to be fully 
considered to ensure their weight or size does not have the potential to
put the public at risk.

'That is why we have a clear 
licensing procedure in place to help ensure any applications for 
decorations can be assessed appropriately.

'Hundreds of these licences are issued for festive decorations across London every year however we are meeting with local traders tomorrow to discuss the matter, with a look to finding a workable solution.'

Councillor
for renewal and recreation Peter Morgan said: 'The traders have worked 
extremely hard to gather funds together to decorate their High Street 
and we have supported them in this.

'We are now pressing TfL, who are 
responsible for this road as a red route, to see if anything can be done
to rectify this situation in time for Christmas.'

A Transport for London spokesman said £4,000 was the maximum charge for the tests, which would cover a £75 admin fee plus any additional charges required to restrict traffic along the road to install or remove the decorations.
