A little girl left with a scarred face after being attacked by a pit bull was thrown out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in Jackson, Mississippi, after an employee said her face was 'scaring the other diners'.

The family of three-year-old Victoria Wilcher were left horrified after they were asked to leave the establishment because of the appearance of the toddler.

The family shared their anger on a Facebook page entitled Victoria's Victories.

Wilcher was injured in an attack in April, when three of her grandfather's pit bull dogs ran into his home in Simpson County, Mississippi. The dogs ripped through the back door of the home and jumped on her.

The dogs then dragged the little girl outside into the backyard, where they continued to maul her before her grandfather, Donald Mullins, and his girlfriend, Rita Tompkins, attempted to stop the carnage. The dogs then attacked their owners, causing Mullins to shoot them. Two of the dogs were killed.

Wilcher was rushed to the emergency room. She suffered a shattered top and bottom jaw, broken cheekbones and eyesockets, and a broken nose. According to the first posting on Victoria's Victories, Wilcher lost her right eye, and lost the ability to move the right side of her face.

Mullins and Tompkins were arrested on charges of child endangerment. The eight surviving pit bulls the pair owned were seized by Animal Control officers.

Wilcher was in the hospital for approximately one month after the attack. Upon her return home, she continued with physical therapy and wearing a feeding tube.

'I took her to the doctor and I went to KFC.' Wilcher's grandmother, Kelly Mullins, told WAPT.

'I ordered a large sweet 
tea and her some mashed potatoes and gravy because she was hungry. She 
was on a feeding tube at the time, but I figured she could just swallow 
(the potatoes).'

'They just told us, they said, "We have 
to ask you to leave because her face is disrupting our customers". 
(Victoria) understood exactly what they said.'

Mullins said she put Victoria in the car and left. She said Victoria cried all the way home to Simpson County.

'Now when we go somewhere, she don't want to get out' said Mullins.

Since the Thursday posting about the incident at KFC, outpourings of sympathy and anger at the company have flooded the family's page, prompting an apology from the chain.

'KFC launched an investigation as soon as we were made aware of this 
report,'Â  KFC spokesman Rick Maynard told WAPT on Friday.

'We take this very seriously, as we have zero tolerance for any 
kind of hurtful or disrespectful actions toward our guests. Our 
investigation is ongoing, but we will make things right for this 
beautiful little girl and her family, and will work with the franchisee 
to take appropriate action at the restaurant.'

KFC also took to Victoria's Victories, responding in comment section of the original post with 'Please accept our sincere apologies while we try to investigate this incident.'
