It might seem strange, but more and more unusual ingredients have been making their way into culinary favourites.

Horlicks makes it into more recipes than you might imagine, with Nigella Lawson including it in her Malteaser cake, and Jamie Oliver swearing by it for a killer hot chocolate.

And while the inclusion of the malted milk powder in sweet dishes might be a tad obvious, it's also a key item in one chef's savoury crab cakes.  

The soft flavour of Horlicks works really well against the big Thai flavours of the crab and fish cakes

The Horlicks recommendation comes from Chef Paul Hartley, who's devised a whole world of drink based recipes in his Horlicks cookbook. 

Chef Harley explains that the soft flavour of the drink powder works really well against the big Thai flavours of the crab and fish cakes.

And as well as being a Horlicks baking fan, Nigella is a dedicated user of Marmite in recipes. 

Coconut water for its high-quality hydrating benefits

Sun Chlorella 'A' algae tablets which contains amino acids and chlorophyll for energy

Acai powder, which contains high antioxidant levels

Camu Camu powder for a hit of vitamin C content for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body

Maca powder - a powerful adaptogen which helps the body handle physical stress

Raw honey for a fast-release sugar hit for energy burst as well as helping to support the immune system

Far from a rogue dollop of the yeast extract in a casserole, Marmite is the star of the show in her spaghetti dish as she says the product offers saltiness and savouriness the way a stock cube might.

Marmite also makes a star appearance in mushrooms, and chocolate cupcakes (recipes below) proving that the love it or hate it condiment has a lot more to it than meets the eye.

While porridge is a boring breakfast staple for most of us, this particular version (recipe below), created by 400m hurdler Ruben Tabares, is full of exotic foods from around the world including superfood Sun Chlorella, a nutritious single celled green algae. 

Want an excuse to eat more chocolate but think dinnertime could be a step too far? Not according to the Hairy Bikers. The bearded chefs say 'adding chocolate to Chilli con Carne, gives it a luxurious velvety sheen.' Be sure to opt for good quality dark chocolate to strengthen the flavours in this punchy dish. 

Britain's favourite savoury yeast spread has made the leap from the breakfast table and is now considered a serious kitchen ingredient

And while it's not unusual to see yogurt featured in main courses and as an accompaniment, this recipe (see below), by Executive Chef Paul Collins at Yeo Valley HQ sees the creamy culture used as the main ingredient in marmalade cake.

For those wanting to branch out and surprise their dinner party guests with a secret ingredient that can't be guessed, here are some recipes for dishes with a difference.

Love it or hate it: This cupcake is made with yeast extract Marmite, chocolate and caramel 

Marmite Cupcakes

Ingredients for the base: 100g dark/ bittersweet chocolate chopped; 175g chopped butter; 225g caster sugar; four eggs; 100g self-raising flour; two and a half tablespoons cocoa powder

Insert: 240g caramel condensed milk; 80g Marmite

Frosting: 120g butter; 500g icing Sugar; one tablespoon milk; 100g Marmite

Ganache: 300g dark chocolate; 300g double cream

Method for the base: Preheat the oven to 180oC/ 350F/ Gas mark 4. Put the chocolate and the butter in a heat proof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Heat, stirring, until the chocolate melts and you have a smooth glossy mixture. Remove from heat and stir in the sugar. Leave to cool for 10 minutes. Now beat with an electric hand mixer for three minutes. Add the eggs one at a time beating, for 10 seconds between each addition. Sift the flour and cocoa powder into the bowl and beat until blended. Divide the mixture between the muffin cases. Bake in a preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until well risen and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely on a wire rack before decorating.

Method for the insert: Mix the condensed caramel and marmite together until fully incorporated. Make an insertion in the cupcake with an apple corer. Fill with the Marmite caramel.

Method for the ganache: Put the chocolate into a large bowl. Heat the cream in a saucepan on a medium heat. Keep stirring until it starts to boil, then add it to the chocolate and stir until all the chocolate has melted and created an emulsion. Leave to set for two or three hours in a cool environment.

Method for the frosting: Beat the butter until light and fluffy. Slowly add the icing sugar and beat until it is fully combined and light and airy. Carefully beat in the Marmite until it is all mixed in. Add the milk if it needs softening. Place the buttercream and ganache in two separate piping bags and place in another piping bag with a star nozzle. Pipe a dual swirl onto the top of the cupcake.

 

Crab cakes made with malted milk drink Horlicks 

Horlicks Thai Style crab cakes

Ingredients: Three large potatoes, three tablespoons of Horlicks Traditional; 50g butter; three small red chillies or one large one; six spring onions, including the green on top; 50g coriander (including stalks) finely chopped; 200g white crab meat; 200g brown crab meat; two eggs, beaten; two teaspoons Thai fish sauce; 200g breadcrumbs made from stale bread; Vegetable oil for frying; salt and pepper to taste

Method: Peel and chop the potatoes and add to a pan of boiling water. Add one tablespoon of Horlicks Traditional powder per large potato and a pinch of salt to the cooking water. Cook until the potatoes are soft. Mash with a little butter and season to taste. Set aside to cool. Remove the seeds from the chillies unless you particularly like very spicy foods. Chop the chillies very finely and put in a large mixing bowl. Slice the spring onions including the green stems finely and also add to the bowl. Chop up the coriander (including the stalks) and add to the bowl. Add both the brown and white crab meat and the cooled down mash potato. Use your hands to mix this all thoroughly. Beat the two eggs and mix in again by hand, and add the two teaspoons of Thai fish sauce. Make a patty roughly the size of your palm and dip into the breadcrumbs coating all sides. Set aside on a plate in the fridge for at least an hour to allow the crab cakes to set. Gently fry in the vegetable oil, cooking for three to four minutes each side, turning once. Serve on a bed of lettuce with a wedge of lemon.
