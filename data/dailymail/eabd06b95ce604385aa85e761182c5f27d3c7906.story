A Michigan woman who has been charged with murdering her newborn daughter gave birth again just weeks ago - and no can find her child. 

Melissa Mitin of Okemos, Michigan is awaiting trial after an incident on December 26, 2013 in which she allegedly gave birth to a daughter in the bathroom of a family friend's home, and then immediately stuffed the crying child in a trash can.

Now, it has been revealed she gave again birth just three weeks while she was out on bail, and she will not tell authorities where they can find her newborn son - this as a dead baby was found in a nearby dumpster.

The Lansing State Journal reports that when Mitin was asked about where her son was by a family court judge earlier this week she said she 'could not recall.' 

Mitin has now had her bail revoked and her attorney wants to test to see if she is competent to stand trial

Ingham County Assistant Prosecutor Debra Rousseau responded to this by saying; 'If that is true then she has some major psychological issues.'

Prosecutors believe that Mitin became pregnant with this second child just three months after her daughter was found face-down in a wastebasket.

Mitin, 25, reportedly left the child there after the incident with her parents finding the baby girl.

According to her mother, Mitin said she was raped. 

Both parents testified they knew nothing of the pregnancy and were against premarital sex for religious reasons and had never talked about the act with their daughter. 

It seems that Mitin was receiving regular checkups for this new pregnancy until 35 weeks, and then stopped showing up.

Rousseasu claims that Mitin told the doctor's office 'she didn't return because she already had given birth,' at which point they notified Child Protective Services.

It is unknown who the father of this second baby is, and the father of the first was a student who attended Michigan State University with Mitin and is now living in another country.

Mitin had recently been  living with her parents at their Okemos home while working on a master's degree in kinesiology at Michigan State University.

Now, Mitin has had her bail in the first murder case revoked, and is undergoing tests to see if she is even competent to stand trial. 

'I have some serious concerns about her psychological well-being,' said her attorney, Dennis Reynolds. 

On Thursday evening, a report came in of a dead baby boy found nearby at a recycling center in Roseville.

The baby had no visible signs of trauma and was believed to be just three days old when he was killed.

Detectives are investigating a possible link between Mitin and the child.
