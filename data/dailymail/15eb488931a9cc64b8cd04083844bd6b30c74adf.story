At 98-year-old, Mary Phillips spends most of her time in the San Francisco apartment she's lived in for 50 years. But now with the city's real estate market booming along with its tech industry, the building's owners see dollar signs and are trying to evict her.

'I've been very happy here,' she told KRON 4. 'I've always paid my rent, I've never been late.'

Phillips is in danger of being booted because the building's owners, Urban Green Investments, are attempting to temporarily shut down the rental property so they can then sell it at a profit.

Mary Phillips, 98, is in danger of being kicked in the street by the building owners hoping to flip the property without any current tenants

In recent years the Bay Area real estate market has exploded leading to property owners nearly doubling evictions as they seek to sell and cash in

Such deals are increasingly common in San Francisco under the Ellis Act.

The company did not respond to interview requests, though this is the second time this year it's drawn controversy for abusing the controversial law, as reported by NBC Bay Area.

Phillips' neighbor, Sarah Brant, told reporters that the company tried to buy tenants out but with one big catch.

'The letter was very clear that they 
would offer a buyout to each unit so long as we got everyone, which of 
course is our wonderful Miss Phillips, out of the building within three 
months,' she said. 'And that is just not possible.'

Building sold under the Ellis Act could be reopened with rents as much as four times higher as previous tenants were paying.

Though Mary is rarely able to go out in her older years, she says the apartment's view lets her have some contact with the outside world

In 2012 through September there were 104 units evicted in the city under the Ellis Act. This year for the same period the number has nearly doubled to reach 200.

Phillips has called San Francisco home in 1937 - the same year the Golden Gate Bridge opened to traffic - but if she's forced out of her apartment she'll be forced to leave the city because rents have gotten so high.

'Feel
 free to let Urban Green CEO David McCloskey, who's evicting her, know 
what you think, ask him how he sleeps at night and if he'd put his 
grandmother on the streets,' read a post on the Vanishingsf Facebook, followed by the company contact information for David@urbangreeninv.com and the office phone number 415-651-4441.

Mary's situation, along with that of hundreds of other Bay Area residents, has led to public demonstrations

Protesters also showed up to support Phillips outside Urban Green Investments' offices Wednesday, though the company has yet to respond.

And Philips says they'll have to drag her out.

'They’re
 going to have to take me out of here feet first,' she said. 'Just 
because of your age, don’t let people push you around.'
