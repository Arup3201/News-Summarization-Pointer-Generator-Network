Andrew Hennells, pictured, posted a message on Facebook admitting his plans to rob a Tesco supermarket 15 minutes before holding up staff

An armed raider threatened staff at a Tesco supermarket with a knife less than fifteen minutes after he boasted on Facebook that he was going to rob the store.

Andrew Hennells, 31, of Gaywood, King's Lynn posted the message 'Doing. Tesco. Over' at 7.25pm on Friday, February 13.  

Withing a quarter of an hour, Norfolk Police received an emergency call that a man brandishing a knife was demanding cash from staff at the supermarket. 

Hennells fled the scene before police arrived but he was arrested by armed police in a nearby pub with £410 in stolen cash. 

Norfolk Crown court heard that officers also recovered a knife.

Hennells, who appeared in court by video link from Norfolk Prison admitted one count of robbery and one count of carrying a knife as an offensive weapon.   

Judge Katherine Moore adjourned the case until April 8 as she requested full pre-sentence and medical reports on Hennells.

The judge said: 'I want all the up-to-date information as to his mental state.'

Judge Moore remanded Hennells in custody and warned him that all sentencing options would be open.

'These are serious matters,' she said.

Commenting after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Pete Jessop, of King's Lynn CID, said a member of the public had tipped them off about the robbery. 

He said: 'We have not got to the bottom of why he posted the pictures and words on Facebook, or why he did the job in the first place.

'It was bizarre and an unusual set of circumstances.

'While the message and pictures on Facebook did not solve the case, it did confirm what we already knew.

'But the thing that made it easier and quicker for us to solve the case was the assistance from the public.

'However, the quickness does not take away from its seriousness or how traumatic it was for the victims of the robbery.'

Hennells also posted on Facebook hours before carrying out the robbery that he had 'shared' a Bare Knuckles Gypsies' 'The hardest man in Ireland' video.

Hennells posted this message only 15 minutes before threatening staff at Tesco's in King's Lynn 

Earlier in the afternoon of the raid, Hennells posted a photograph of a large knife on his Facebook page
