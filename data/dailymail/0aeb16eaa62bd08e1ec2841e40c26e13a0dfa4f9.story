Captain Wales: Prince Harry races out from the VHR (very high readiness) tent to scramble his Apache

My ten-year-old son was delighted the other day to find a quotation from me appearing on the screen while he was playing the PlayStation game Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3.

But I was just bemused.

Ten years ago, in Kuwait, when I spoke the words ‘It is a big step to take another human life. It is not to be done lightly’, I was preparing the men of my battle group to cross into Iraq for the liberation with every expectation they would be doing exactly that: taking human lives.

I never imagined that thought would feature in a computer game. So when I read yesterday of Prince Harry using a striking phrase to describe killing Taliban insurgents — he said the Army would ‘take them out of the game’ — his words had a certain resonance for me.

Given that in the same interview Harry also talked about his love of PlayStation and Xbox games, civilians could be forgiven for thinking that soldiers treat war as some sort of glorified game; a boys’ own adventure in which violent death is visited upon the enemy simply by pushing a button.

So is killing on the battlefield really done with as little thought as when one blasts the bad guys in a computer game?

Nothing could be further from the truth.

No one knows better than Captain Wales — who was in charge of the weapons systems on an Apache attack helicopter — that taking someone ‘out of the game’ means blasting them to smithereens. That is what happens to a person on the receiving end of a 30-millimetre explosive bullet.

Soldiers who have served on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan know what it is like to kill, to knowingly and purposefully take the life of another human being. They know what the consequence looks like, too.

They do not take it lightly, not least because the chances are that they will have lost friends to enemy bullets.

All trades have their lingo, and the Army is no different. It just happens that one of the consequences of the military trade is death.

It is no surprise that the terrible reality and absolute finality is cloaked in euphemisms. It is a psychological necessity. It protects the soldiers — allows them to get on with the job.

Nor is it a new phenomenon. The language changes, but the meaning is the same. In World War I, dead soldiers were said to have ‘bought the farm’, or simply ‘bought it’. A serious life-changing wound was a ‘Blighty one’, meaning a trip home to the UK.

In World War II, meanwhile, Russian soldiers would warn sentries heading out into No-man’s Land to be particularly careful where Nazi snipers were known to lurk with a cautionary: ‘Stick your head up there and no more dinners.’

In my service in the SAS, we would talk about a terrorist ‘getting the good news’ or ‘rolling a seven’. In the Royal Irish, the slang tended to be more direct: a dead enemy had been ‘slotted’ or ‘dropped’.

When it comes to death and destruction, all soldiers need a way to talk about it without talking about it. Fighters need to cast a glance at death, often on a daily basis, yet never look him in the eye. All armies do it.

But it is not just the business of killing that is spoken of in a different language. All areas of army life have their jargon, and the British Army has always adopted terms from wherever it served.

Even when I joined in 1981, long after the demise of the Empire, the language of the Army was loaded with words in Urdu and Hindi left over from the days of the Raj: laundry was ‘dhobi’; tea was ‘cha’; a small wall was a ‘bund’; the toilet was the ‘khazi’. A look was a ‘shufti’ — from the Arabic.

In the SAS, we would talk of going to one’s ‘basha’ (the Malay for ‘house’), and the jungle was the ‘ulu’.

This jargon serves a purpose. To know 
the lingo was a sign of achieving acceptance, and to be accepted means a
soldier has a better chance of survival in combat because he must 
almost always rely on his colleagues.

It
is also a handy way of dealing with some horrible realities.

I recall 
enquiring about one of my sergeants who had sustained terrible leg 
wounds from an improvised explosive device (IED). I was told that it was
likely that he would be ‘excused boots’. ‘Excused saluting’ with a left
or right arm — or both — speaks for itself.

It is the kind of black humour that has helped soldiers cope with the bloody reality of war for millennia.

On the day we crossed into Iraq, I had my sergeant major organise some Iraqi POWs to bury one of their number killed in the fighting. Tired and hungry, they did a bad job.

The next day my own soldiers had to dig a proper grave to re‑bury the dead man because rigor mortis had made him bend forward and upwards and out of his very shallow grave to present something for the local dogs to gnaw on.

My sergeant major explained that he had 
found him ‘sitting up in bed’ and our lads had made him ‘more comfy’. Of
course, in reality, the scene was one of horror, putrefaction and 
appalling stench.

And that is the point. You never talk about the business of warfare directly, or if you do, you do it very precisely. It is either slang and jargon, or the emotion-free military terms and language honed at Staff College.

I recall in Northern Ireland how a would-be petrol bomber, having lit his device, tripped and ended up in flames of his own doing. ‘Oh, he’s put his blazer on,’ quipped one soldier.

The avoidance of stating the obvious is international, but it is the British above all who keep their emotions in check with euphemisms — sometimes to the frustration of our U.S. colleagues, who don’t always get it.

This can have unintended consequences, as when Brigadier Tom Brodie — commanding the Commonwealth 29th Brigade in Korea — was asked by a U.S. general how things were going as his 600 soldiers were being attacked by a force of 30,000 Chinese troops.

Brodie admitted to the American that ‘things are a little sticky up here’. The U.S. general took that to mean ‘not too bad’ and so held back support. As a result, the Royal Ulster Rifles only escaped by a miracle and the Glosters were over-run.

Even as I gave my eve-of-battle speech in Kuwait, I did so in a manner meant for the men. I did not refer to killing or being killed; I talked of ‘taking lives’, or ‘not seeing the end of the campaign’. The boys knew well enough what I meant.

It is the same when Prince Harry talks about taking Taliban ‘out of the game’ — and let us not forget that this is exactly how all his comrades-in-arms talk. He knows too well what it means.

He may joke that his PlayStation has honed his reflexes, but once again that is a soldier’s flippancy disguising the deadly seriousness of his mission.

For this is also a man who has looked down from his helicopter cockpit, identified enemy fighters running for their lives and witnessed the result when he has unleashed the awesome power at his fingertips.
