Murdered: Rohan Gucchait, a pupil at the All Saints High School in Mumbai, was kidnapped more than a week ago by an electrician hired by his father, a jeweler, to wiork on the family home near Mumbai

A murder-kidnap gang are facing the death penalty in India after the dismembered body of a 12-year-old-boy was found near a flower market.

Rohan Gucchait, a pupil at the All Saints High School in Mumbai, had been kidnapped more than a week ago by an electrician hired by his father, a jeweler, to work on his house.

Ishtiyaq Sayyed Shaikh, 37, spent 11 days masterminding a plan to kidnap the boy in return for ransom, painstakingly plotting the family's movements from a secret vantage point that overlooked their home.

But the plan went awry when he phoned the boy's parents to demand 5,000,000 rupees (£50,000)... only to find they were already reporting their son's disappearance to police.

Rather than give himself up and release the boy, Sheikh ordered his accomplices to strangle him instead and chop the body into pieces with an electric saw.

They then scattered the boy's body parts about APMC flower market in Kalyan, near Mumbai.

All five men now face the death penalty after they were arrested and charged with kidnap and murder.

The abduction took place at around 11am on April 17, when Shaikh arrived on a motorbike at the housing complex in which the Gucchaits lived telling Rohan his father wanted to see him at his shop.

He already knew the boy would be home alone because he had been charting the family's movements for over a week. CCTV later captured Shaikh driving out of the complex with Rohan riding pillion.

About two hours later, the two stepped into a sports shop, police said, where Shaikh bought a cricket bat for Rs1,400 and told Rohan to check it outside, where his four accomplices lay in wait.

Gruesome: Rather than give himself up and release the boy, Sheikh ordered his accomplices to strangle Roshan instead and chop the body into pieces with an electric saw. They hid his body parts around the APMC flower market in Kalyan, near Mumbai

Callous: The AMPC flower market is a bustling hub of local trade

They grabbed the boy, bundled him into a van and drove away.

But the kidnapper had not expected Rohan's parents to go straight to the police when their son did not return home.

Tragically, by the time Shaikh made the ransom call, Mr and Mrs Gucchait were already at the police station.

Shaikh learned that he was being hunted by detectives when the parents returned home, overhearing a conversation from his spy position.

So, that same night, he arranged for the boy to be killed.

His body parts had been scattered about several locations, all near the flower 
market. The parts were then recovered after Shaikh made a full 
confession.

Police said the electrician turned killer was driven by greed and plotted his crime over 11 days, carefully plotting the movements of the boy and his family.

It was Shaikh who had told the boy he was wanted at his father's shop, and kidnapped him on the way, they said.
