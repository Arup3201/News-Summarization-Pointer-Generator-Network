Family feud: Igor Ustinov is attempting to claim part of his actor father's film royalties

Sir Peter Ustinov's son says he is 'close to bankruptcy' after losing the latest round of a long-running court battle over his father's estate.

Igor Ustinov claims the renowned actor intended to leave him the royalties to his work, and is fighting to claim the money from Sir Peter's third wife.

But yesterday a High Court judge ruled that there was not enough evidence to launch a case in the UK, and said she was 'appalled' at the money wasted on the family feud.

The 56-year-old sculptor faces a bill of £114,000 in legal costs after his bid to get his hands on his father's riches failed.

Mr Ustinov, the actor's son by his second wife, has been fighting his stepmother Helene in the Swiss courts since Sir Peter's death in 2004, arguing that a will he wrote in 1968 should be honoured.

Although that case is still ongoing, he launched a parallel action in Britain aiming to capture the rights to the actor's intellectual property and royalties.

His lawyer Ian Meakin argued in court that 'overarching' lifetime trusts set up by Sir Peter had put the rights to his work out of reach of his widow, leaving his assets in the hands of his children.

The whereabouts of those rights and royalties - which were said to have been put into an offshore structure by Sir Peter decades before his death - have not been confirmed.

The barrister argued that Mr Ustinov's research indicated that two Swiss lawyers control the alleged trusts - something which they vigorously deny.

Mr Meakin asked the judge to transfer the part of the legal row concerning the trusts to the jurisdiction of the English courts.

Inheritance: Sir Peter Ustinov died near his home in Switzerland in 2004, aged 82

Mrs Justice Proudman accepted that Sir Peter had set up 'tax efficient structures under which he could receive royalties for his creative endeavours, namely writing and acting'.

But she said that there was 'no evidence of any actual trust', ruling that Mr Ustinov was unable to prove that his father's money was intended from him.

'Mr von Ustinov can't say who are its beneficiaries and what are its terms,' she said. 'His claim is the most fragile claim imaginable. Nor is there any evidence of any trust governed by English law.'

The judge suggested that the sculptor's intention was to use the legal process to obtain documents which could prove his claim.

She concluded that to hear part of the case in the UK would lead to 'risks of inconsistent findings and irreconcilable judgements'.

Speaking outside court, Mr Ustinov said that the costs of the long-running case had exhausted his funds, and insisted that his father intended him to receive his inheritance.

'I was very close to my father - when he died I was holding his hand and I felt like he had asked me to put some order into his affairs, but it has been very hard,' he said.

'Now I'm close to bankruptcy and I don't know what to do. Nine years I've been fighting and I didn't inherit a penny yet.'

He added: 'This action was not really against my stepmother or my sisters, it was about the fact that my father saved up money and rights for years and now they are not available to the family.

'These trusts contained the rights and royalties to everything he wrote, his film rights and everything. It's a very sad story because the family have no way of getting hands on them.'

Relatives: Sir Peter's daughter Tamara, left, and her husband Malcolm Rennie, right, lamented the cost of the case

His half-sister Tamara said: 'It's one of those funny situations which arise in families sometimes. I can't begin to imagine what it has cost.'

Her husband Malcolm added: 'Peter was a wonderful man and I loved him very much as a son-in-law, but being successful at such a high level as he was, everybody wanted a piece of him.

'I would be surprised if there is anything left in the estate - it has probably all gone to the lawyers.'

Sir Peter, a double Oscar winner, was born in England but moved to Switzerland in 1960 and lived there until his death.
