A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another boy the same age was stabbed on a double decker bus.

It is believed the teenage victim was injured during a fight on board a 151 bus in Sutton, south-west London, at around 2.30pm yesterday.

He reportedly got off the bus near the Rose Hill roundabout and walked around 250 yards before collapsing outside a KFC takeaway on St Helier Avenue.

He was taken to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries and his condition last night was described as 'serious but stable'.

One witness, who has asked not to be named, said: 'I saw a young boy laid on the floor. There were about three officers set about him.

'Then all us a sudden a few minutes later it went a bit manic and bit mad.

'There must have been about 10 police cars that turned up. A rapid response car and ambulance also turned up about five minutes after.

'It made me feel cold. It was really horrible.'

The Metropolitan Police said a 15-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. He was taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody.
