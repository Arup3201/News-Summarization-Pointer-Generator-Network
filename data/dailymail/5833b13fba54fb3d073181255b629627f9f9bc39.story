Downing Street and the Home Office were last night said to be at war over a 'malicious' and 'petty' attempt to stop two of Theresa May's closest allies becoming MPs.

In an increasingly toxic feud, it emerged that Nick Timothy, the Home Secretary's most senior aide, has been blocked from running in a safe Tory seat at the General Election.

Another of her advisers, Stephen Parkinson, has also been suspended from the party's approved candidates list.

Conservative HQ says the pair were kicked off the list after failing to campaign for the party in the recent Rochester by-election that was won by Ukip.

But both men insist that as special advisers – whose salaries come from the taxpayer – they were barred by their code of conduct from actively campaigning.

They are understood to have been backed by Mrs May, who is seen by many Tories as the favourite to succeed David Cameron.

However Tory HQ claimed special advisers were given clearance to campaign in last month's by-election by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood's office, and that all advisers had been told to canvass.

Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson say they received no confirmation of this special clearance. One source said they had requested details from Sue Gray, the Cabinet Office head of ethics and propriety, on seven occasions but received no reply.

Previous internal guidance on special advisers from David Cameron's political private secretary Laurence Mann, seen by the Daily Mail, said they could help in by-elections 'in their own time and outside office hours, but only by providing backroom support, for example stuffing envelopes ... you could not do telephone campaigning or door-to-door canvassing'.

Mr Timothy wanted to stand for Aldridge-Brownhills in Walsall, West Midlands.

Rea Rutherford-Carlisle, chairman of the local Tory association, said it was 'deeply concerning and completely unacceptable' that local activists had been 'deliberately misled' by Tory HQ about Mr Timothy when he ran for selection, which has a Tory majority of 15,266. Party chiefs are accused of falsely telling local activists that he had withdrawn from the race before suspending him from its list of approved candidates.

Mrs Rutherford-Carlisle has told Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps that the constituency was suspending the selection of a candidate and demanding that he investigated the matter personally.

In a letter, she told him that the committee considering candidates was 'told by a party official that Mr Timothy had withdrawn himself' from the race. 

She added: 'This would appear not to be the case.' In a letter to her, Mr Timothy said he wanted to make clear it was 'untrue' that he had withdrawn from the selection process, adding: 'I was informed that I have been suspended from the candidates' list. This, I was told, is because I did not participate in telephone canvassing during the Rochester by-election campaign.

'This decision cannot be valid because, as Theresa May's chief of staff, I am bound by the code of conduct for special advisers.' Mr Timothy, who has been blamed by No10 for fuelling speculation about Mrs May's leadership ambitions, declined to comment further last night. 

But a source said his treatment appeared 'malicious', 'petty' and 'inept', given that if he was selected for a seat he would have to leave the Home Secretary's side.

Tory HQ disputed some of Mr Timothy's claims. A party source insisted Sir Jeremy's office and Miss Gray had cleared special advisers to take part in telephone canvassing in Rochester, as long as it was in their spare time, adding: 'It is not true that anyone said Nick Timothy had withdrawn, there will be no investigation.'

Mr Parkinson attempted to win the Tory candidacy in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where William Hague is MP and the Tories had a 23,386 majority in 2010.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 'Special advisers have always been able in their own time and outside office hours to take part in back-office activities. This approach was agreed with the Cabinet Office.'

He was unable to say whether telephone canvassing – which appears in clear breach of the rules – had been approved.
