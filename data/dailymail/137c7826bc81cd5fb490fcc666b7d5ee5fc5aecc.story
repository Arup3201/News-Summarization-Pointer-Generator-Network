The Danish royal family have been photographed during the first stop on their week-long tour of Greenland - and the family photographs are remarkablyÂ  ordinary.

The images show the parents and their playful children looking just like any other young family, prompting the question: Are Mary and Frederik the world's most down-to-earth royals?

With absolutely no pretentiousness, the laidback couple appear a little exhausted but unfazed as their four children run playfully around the Igaliko countryside.

The Danish royal family were a picture of normality as they posed for photos during their official visit in Igaliko, Greenland.

It was the first stop on their tour, which will see them travel on The Royal Yacht Dannebrog around South and West Greenland until August 8.

Crown Prince Frederik, Crown Princess Mary and their children Prince Christian, Prince Vincent, Princess Isabella and Princess Josephine were all smiles are they boarded the Royal Yacht Dannebrog on Thursday which will take them around South and West Greenland from August 1 to August 8.

Australian-born Crown Princess of Denmark appeared to be relaxed as she pulled off casual chic with style and grace.

The Crown Princess, who hails from Tasmania, wore a navy blazer, striped top and cropped trousers which were paired with blue wedges.

Her husband Crown Prince Frederik dressed down in a beige blazer, a sky blue shirt, maroon trousers and matching scarf.

Their two boys wore similar outfits, trousers with a shirt and a grey cardigan or sweater, while the girls modelled matching ensembles - headbands, white top, cardis and flowy skirts.

The royal family will visit the southern-Greenland towns of Igaliko and Narsaq on their first day.

Last week, the royal couple were spotted horse riding in the morning at Graasten Palace in southern Denmark.

They were also seen leaving the stables on their mountain bikes on July 24 during their annual visit to their summer residence.

The pair spent some quality time alone as Princesses Isabella, 7, Josephine, 3, Prince Vincent, 3, and Prince Christian, 8 were no where to be seen.

Graasten Palace - in Denmark's southern region of Jutland - has been the royal summer house since 1935.
