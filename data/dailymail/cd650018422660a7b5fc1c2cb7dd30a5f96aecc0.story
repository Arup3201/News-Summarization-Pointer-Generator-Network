The Prime Minister's grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Malcolm Mount, was wounded at D-Day in Normandy. Today Cameron paid tribute to those who took part in the landings

Prime Minister David Cameron has paid tribute to the 'men and women of D-Day' including his own grandfather during a banquet for war veterans at St Paul's Cathedral.

The event was part of the BBC's Great British Menu show which saw a succession of chefs challenged to create a menu fit for heroes inspired by the Second World War.

The Prime Minister's grandfather, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Malcolm Mount, was commissioned in the 99th (Bucks and Berks Yeomanry), a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, in 1924 and over the years rose to the rank of major.

Mount transferred to the Reconnaissance Corps in 1941 and soon after was made Lieutenant-Colonel. He was wounded at D-Day in Normandy.

The show, which has already been filmed, ended with the winning menu served to guests including Winston Churchill's granddaughter Celia Sandys and will be broadcast next Friday.

Other specially invited guests include several D-Day veterans and Conservative peer Baroness Trumpington who worked as a cypher clerk at Bletchley Park.

Mr Cameron told them he could not imagine 'what it must have been like to land on those beaches - to uncertainty, to terrifying danger, to possible death'.

He said: 'But that is exactly what thousands of young men did.

'One of them was my grandfather. He landed on the Normandy beaches and was wounded just a few days later. I'm so proud of what he did and let me tell you I'm so proud to be in the presence of so many D-Day veterans today.'

The Prime Minister also praised the heroes 'on the home front' who made 'a vital contribution to the war effort'.

He said: 'My generation, this country, we enjoy freedom. We enjoy democracy because of the sacrifices your generation made and we must never, ever forget that.

'Everyone, raise your glasses to the men and women of D-Day.'
