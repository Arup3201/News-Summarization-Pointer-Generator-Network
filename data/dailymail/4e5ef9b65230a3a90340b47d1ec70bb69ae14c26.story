No greater, or more determined, fighters ever squared off in the ring than the legendary Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier.

Their 1971 match was deemed the 'fight of the century' - with Ali returning from three years in exile after losing his boxing license to battle reigning heavyweight champion Frazier.

On the anniversary of 'Smokin' Joe Frazier's death from cancer on November 7 last year, these stunning black and white images capture the palpable bloodlust between the two world-class fighters - both in and out of the ring.

Taken for Life Magazine, Ali and Frazier were pictured facing off at training camps and weigh-ins ahead of the match at Madison Square Garden on May 8.

The fight was highly anticipated due to media hype and the combative behavior of the two prize boxers. There was the added incentive of a record-breaking purse of $2.5million promised to both athletes if they won.

Ali, undefeated in his professional career but now in the role of challenger, taunted Frazier at weigh-ins and even traveled to his training camp to bait him - angering the reigning champ and making him even more driven to succeed.

Ali had been out of professional boxing for three years after he refused the draft for the Vietnam War and was stripped of his heavyweight belt in 1967.

He was sentenced to five years in prison but while the case was on appeal, he was granted a boxing license for Atlanta in 1970 - knocking out Jerry Quarry in three rounds.

New York followed suit and after Ali 
beat Oscar Bonavena, the only person that stood in his way to reclaim 
the title was Frazier.

The fighters went for 15 grueling rounds at a packed Madison Square Garden with Ali eventually being knocked out and dealt his first professional loss. 

Ali regained the championship title on October 30, 1974 after beating George Foreman during the historic 'Rumble in the Jungle'.

Later in life, Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's, and the late Frazier reached an uneasy truce and appeared together at professional dinners and awards ceremonies.

However Ali has always referred to his long-time nemesis as 'the greatest fighter of all times -  next to me'.
