Britain should be proud that David Cameron is isolated in Europe in the incr3asingly bitter row over Brussels jobs, Jeremy Hunt claimed today.

The Health Secretary backed the Prime Minister's ‘lonely’ fight to block Jean-Claude Juncker from becoming European Commission president amid brutal criticism.

It follows claims from Poland’s foreign minister Radek Sikorski that Mr Cameron of ‘f****d up’ attempts to veto the last European treaty.

EU leaders will meet at the Menin Gate in Ypres on Thursday for a dinner to mark the start of the First World War.

But behind the scenes wrangling continues over Mr Juncker’s candidacy, with almost every EU country united in pushing the plan through despite opposition from Britain.

Mr Cameron is planning to push the issue to an unprecedented vote in Brussels on Friday to hammer home his argument that the former Luxembourg prime minister is the wrong person to lead the Commission.

But Mr Hunt insists he is 'very proud' that the PM is taking the fight to Brussels.

'Sometimes leadership is lonely,' Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4. 'But if it is the right thing to do for Britain I am glad that we have got a strong Prime Minister who is prepared to take those steps.

'Even if it means that he is isolated from time to time, I think people in Europe will respect the person who tells the truth that Europe needs to be reformed, that it can't carry on the way it is doing, it is unacceptable to put in place someone who doesn't stand for reform and I am very proud that we have a Prime Minister who is prepared to do that, however difficult it is... however isolated.

'He is going out there, to these very difficult negotiations, fighting for the British national interest.

'It is not comfortable. He is the first Prime Minister who has vetoed a European treaty and that was a huge shock to the system.'

Mr Cameron yesterday held ‘full and frank’ talks with Herman van Rompuy, the current president of the EU Council.

Speaking in Downing Street, the PM made clear he would fight 'until the end' the nomination as his successor of the man seen by the UK as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform.

With a majority of EU leaders - including Germany's Angela Merkel - throwing their weight behind Mr Juncker's candidacy, the Prime Minister looks certain to be out-voted under the qualified majority system, and is thought unlikely to secure enough support even to form a blocking minority of four or more member states.

But the deep divisions caused by Mr Cameron’s EU strategy were exposed by extraordinary remarks made by Poland's foreign minister.

Mr Sikorski is reported to have accused Mr Cameron of 'incompetence in European affairs' as part of a colourfully-worded private exchange with a former ministerial colleague.

In a covert recording leaked to Polish magazine Wprost, he is said to have accused the Prime Minister of falling foul of 'stupid propaganda' and trying to appease his critics by feeding them scraps, only for the strategy to backfire.

In the conversation, Mr Sikorski is reported to have said: 'It's either a very badly thought through move, or, not for the first time, a kind of incompetence in European affairs.

'Remember? He f***** up the fiscal pact. He f***** it up. Simple as that. He is not interested, he does not get it, he believes in the stupid propaganda, he stupidly tries to play the system.

'His whole strategy of feeding (his critics) scraps in order to satisfy them is just as I predicted, turning against him.

'He should have said, f*** off, tried to convince people and isolate (the sceptics). But he ceded the field to those that are now embarrassing him.'

Chancellor George Osborne has accused European leaders of saying one thing in private and another in public about the appointment.

There has been speculation that Mr van Rompuy would prefer to delay a decision to avoid a row over the nomination overshadowing a visit by EU leaders on Thursday to Ypres to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War.

Tory MP Bernard Jenkin dismissed the criticism.

'When a system is being challenged and needs to be challenged, very often the vested interests in the system resort to abuse because they can't hear, they can't understand, what is going wrong,' he told BBC Radio 4.

‘If [Mr Cameron] succeeded in reversing this decision it would be a huge triumph for British diplomacy but I suspect this is now a foregone conclusion, everyone has dug in.

'But there are two messages in this: one is that Jean-Claude Juncker is the tip of a very large federalist iceberg.

'There is a very, very strong and consensual agenda amongst the establishment and the majority of the member states to go down the root of a federal state.'
