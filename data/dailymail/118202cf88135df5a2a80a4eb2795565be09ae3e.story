David Beckham has hit a major hurdle in his plans to build a 25,000-seat stadium in Miami to home Major League Soccer's next franchise.

An alliance of shipping businesses and a billionaire car dealer have launched a campaign protesting the Englishman's development in the Port of Miami in Florida, which would include a restaurant anda nightclub.

The consortium made their opposition clear in a full-page advertisement in two major newspapers on Monday, claiming the stadium would threaten the city's plans to capitalise on the expansion of the Panama Canal if it should go ahead as planned.

The as-yet-unnamed stadium, funded by Beckham and his partners, would annually host 17 MLS games, as well as additional post-season fixtures, friendlies, and other entertainment.

In the Miami Herald and its sister Spanish-language paper, El Nuevo Herald, the Miami Seaport Alliance told Beckham: 'We cannot jeopardise well-paying jobs, like crane operators, longshore workers, and mechanics, for low-paying stadium jobs, such as concession sales.'

The group is being led by John Fox, the retired as Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's head of governmental affairs, and includes billionaire car dealer Norman Braman, who owned the Philadelphia Eagles from 1985-1994. Beckham's group also faces opposition from two chapters of the International Longshoremen's Association and two stevedore companies, whose workers load and unload ships.

‘There are plenty of other places for the stadium to be,’ Braman said.

Prime real estate: Port of Miami is one of the world's busiest ports

The English former football player last month unveiled detailed plans for a 25,000-seat waterfront stadium
 on the island port with sweeping views of downtown Miami.

Development of the 36-acre space would cost about $200m and include shops, hotels and offices connected to the mainland by a pedestrian bridge.

The port is one of four potential areas for the new stadium, which Beckham's team say will create a new destination for Miami residents.

Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said: ‘There’s nothing concrete, there's no recommendation pending.’ 

The port's master plan calls for the development of more than 7m-sq-ft of convention, hotel and office space on the same site.

Before Monday's ad, only Royal Caribbean, which is headquartered at the port, has come out publicly against Beckham's plan.

Neisen Kasdin, an attorney for Akerman Senterfitt and adviser for the Beckham group, said: ‘The plan doesn't interfere with port operations.

‘It will likely generate more revenue for the port in the shorter term than other concepts that have been discussed.’

Yet a growing list of opponents say a stadium would jeopardise Miami's aspiration of becoming a more attractive choice for global shippers looking to distribute goods to the US market.

Neither Braman nor Fox would say who paid for the two ads in Monday's papers, worth nearly $25,000.

‘I haven't given any dollars yet but I would if asked,’ Braman added.
