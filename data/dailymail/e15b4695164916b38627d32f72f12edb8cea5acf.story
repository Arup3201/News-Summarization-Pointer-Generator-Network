The art of making a good cup of tea has been perfected over centuries - requiring care, attention and a good degree of patience. For those who have none of these, there are tea bags.

But now a new gadget promises to allow those pressed for time to enjoy the delicate flavours that come from a brew made from loose tea leaves.

The designers of the Mychai claim it can transform a mug of cold water into a steaming cup of tea in just a few minutes simply by placing it in the water and pressing a button.

The MyChai, shown above, allows tea lovers to make a brew using loose tea leaves by adding it to cold water

The battery powered device, which is designed to fit inside a handbag or pocket, can heat the water and diffuse the leaves at the press of a button.

The device features four different settings that will adjust the brew time according to whether you prefer green tea, black tea, herbal tea or Oolong. 

Uttara Ghodke, 22, an industrial design student from Pune, near Mumbai in India, has spent two years developing the device.

She is now hoping to attract support on the crowdfunding site Behance to develop her prototype into a commercial product.

Miss Ghodke, said: 'Being an enormous fan of tea, I always dreamed of owning a portable tea maker which I can carry anywhere.

The battery powered device will make two or three cups of tea on a single charge, according to the designer

The device, pictured above, is not yet commercially available but Miss Ghodke hopes to sell it for around £35

'I thought why not convert this idea into reality. This is how I came up with the idea of an entirely portable personal tea maker.

'Mychai's portability and its new technology makes it stand out from other products.

'It doesn't involve any electrical connection to work. It operates on a rechargeable battery which will allow for two or three cups to be made on one charge.'

Users fill the base of the MyChai with the loose tea leaves of their choice before connecting it to the rest of the device.

A thermoelectric material in the stem of the gadget acts as a heating element to warm the water to the required temperature.

Once it reaches the right temperature, a hatch will open to allow the tea leaves to be infused in the water.

For black tea it will heat the water to 88 degrees and brew it for three minutes, for green tea the water is heated to 78 degrees C and is brewed for two minutes.

Oolong tea is also brewed for three minutes at 99 degrees C while herbal tea uses water at the same temperature for six minutes.

Once the brewing time is over, the hatch will close and prevent the leaves from stewing.

Miss Ghodke said she hopes to sell the device for around £35 when it gets to market.

She said: 'Mychai is a personal, portable tea maker that helps you get your fix anytime, anywhere.'

The British Standards Institution has published official guidelines on how to make the perfect cup of tea.

They explain that the pot must be made of porcelain, there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served.

For standard black tea, the BSI says that freshly boiled water should be used - with temperatures above 95°C (203°F).  

Water should be left to cool down for at least 30 seconds when making green and white tea, with a recommended temperature of 74°C to 85°C (160°F to 203°F). 

Oolong tea is best steeped in 85°C (185°F) water. 

Herbal teas should be steeped in water with a temperature of 95°C (203°F). 

Regardless of the temperature, the BSI says that tea should be steeped for six minutes.

Milk should be added to the cup first before the tea is poured from the pot. 

At least 2.5ml milk is recommended for use with a smaller pot, and 5ml milk is advised for the larger pot. 

This helps the milk mix more evenly though the 'liquor' when the tea is added.

To make sure the water doesn't scald the milk, the BSI explained that its temperature should not exceed 85°C (185°F), but should be above 60°C (140°F) for optimum flavour and sensation. 

According to the official best practice guide by London-based British Standards Institution there must be at least 2g of tea for every 100ml of water used, and the water must not exceed 85°C (185°F) when served with milk. At least 2.5ml of milk should be added to a small bowl or cup before the infused water is added
