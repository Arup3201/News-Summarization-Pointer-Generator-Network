There are many exclusive private members clubs in the capital and other areas of the country but now a new venue has taken the concept to the next level.

Grace Belgravia in Knightsbridge offers everything from GP services to dinner and a massage under one roof, exclusively for women.

The very swanky club houses Britain's top celebrity facialist, leading nutritionists, personal trainers - and even gynaecologists - within its 11,500 square feet of serene surroundings.

FEMAIL spent a day at Grace being pampered, revitalised and rejuvenated after taking a tour of the grounds, and we're sold on the concept.

Grace Belgravia's reception/breakfast room is a tranquil escape for busy working women

Grace CEO Kate Percival calls her club an 'inclusive sorority of like-minded 
women'.

It
 is the first members club for women to take a 360 degree approach to the concept of women's 
lifestyle, health and wellbeing, providing top-quality fitness, beauty, medicine and culture under one rather sophisticated roof.

Their aim is to empower
 and nurture women through all stages of life, from young adulthood, 
fertility, pregnancy, child rearing, empty nesting, menopause and 
ageing.

The club, housed is a grade-two listed 
building in West Halkin Street, Belgravia, call themselves the place for
 'spirited, sophisticated and health conscious women who want the very 
best in life' - and their specialists do their very best to help them 
achieve it.

While the concept is unarguably divine, life membership comes in at a hefty £55,000 for 19 years.

There is hope for the average working
 woman in London, though, as annual membership starts at £1,400 for 
weekends up to £5,500 for full-time. There are also options to pay 
monthly, such as junior membership which is £220 a month for under 30s. 
Joining fees apply.

The club is flooded with natural light and holds many highbrow cultural events such as lectures

Specifically designed to be a haven from busy city life, the club is flooded with natural light on the first and mezzanine floors.

The restoration blends an exciting combination of classical and contemporary design and this beautiful space allows for a diverse range of cultural and intellectually stimulating activities, including lectures, debates, gallery launches and fashion shows.

This is the incredible place where Dream Float Therapy takes place - non-members can book one, too

Don't expect to stay awake in the 90 minutes you're submerged in the Acqua Calda spa experience.

One of the signature treatments is the Dream Time Float Therapy massage which involves an entire body overhaul while relaxing on a weightless floatation bed.

The incredible reviving massage treatment combines water, steam, salts and essential oils to heal and invigorate from the outside in. It's more relaxing than anything I've tried before.

After a dry sauna and invigorating shower, fine re-mineralising sea salts were applied to my body to buff and refine the skin.

Following the light and pain-free scrub I popped in the Vichy shower to wash off residue before getting back on the weightless floatation bed (with heated water mattress!).

I was given a thorough, firm yet relaxing body massage with fragrant, sleep enhancing oils.

I'm told the therapist then applied a nourishing full body mask and wrapped me in a soft muslin so I'd be cocooned to relax, while the mask deeply penetrated my skin with steam.

If only I'd been awake to fully experience it!

This wonderful treatment is said to boost the immune system, invigorate the senses and leave you glowing from the inside out. I certainly was.

90 min £185.00, closed to non-members. Women only.

concept of 'inside out beauty', and the integrated treatments and

Grace's PTs train members in the well-equipped gym, and work closely alongside the resident GPs and physiotherapists, reinforcing the 360 degree mantra

Grace's gym is well-equipped and they hold yoga, pilates and many more classes. The club has appointed a dream team of top personal trainers - many trained by world-famous PT Matt Roberts. They work closely alongside the resident GPs and physiotherapists, reinforcing the 360 degree mantra.

When FEMAIL visited for a day, we spent an hour with an intuitive, softly spoken but rigorous trainer who pushed us just a bit further than we wanted to train - exactly the way it should be. The session, should it not be included in your membership package, costs £90.

The club facilities include a chic bar, tranquil library and even a salon for those emergency blow drys.

Their in-house nutritionists and medical experts work closely with their chefs to bring a menu of natural, raw, nutritionally optimised foods and cooking styles to their restaurant for health-conscious members.
