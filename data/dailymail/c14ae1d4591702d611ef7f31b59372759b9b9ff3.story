A teenager was late for her own 18th birthday party after a trainee hairdresser spent six hours giving her a 'terrible' and 'lopsided' style.

Paige Kearns from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, paid £85 for a shampoo and a blonde dip dye to look her best for the 1960s themed party. Unbeknown to her, the job was given to a trainee stylist.

Having arrived at Decisions salon in Basford just after 3pm, she finally left six hours later - with what she describes as 'lopsided' dyed hair.

The waitress eventually arrived at her party at 9.30pm - over two-and-a-half hours late. By the time she arrived, her relatives from Wales were leaving to go home.

The teen says because of the disastrous trip to the hairdressers she 'didn't enjoy her party at all' - which took place on March 15, cost £600 and had taken months to organise.

Miss Kearns says the style
 has gained her a lot of unwanted attention - with people mocking her 
hair in the street.

She says she has tried to get a full refund from the salon - who, she claims, have only offered her £40.

Now, she is pursuing legal action after the salon 'refused to take any blame' for the style.

She said: 'I couldn't believe what they had done - people were laughing at me in the street.

'I was left looking like an Afghan hound dog, it was so humiliating. Your 18th birthday is supposed to be special but it turned into a nightmare for me.

'I thought the hair cut was going to be done by 6pm but I was concerned when the hairdresser asked how to mix the colours.

'It looked like she was just mixing 
some paint but I was too shy and scared to say anything - I had no idea 
she wasn't qualified to do it.

'I
 am known for my long hair and now it is ruined. The colour has gone all
 orange and the dip dye is much higher than I wanted and not even 
straight.

The waitress posted this picture of the style on Facebook shortly after her birthday on March 15. She says she has been mocked in the street for the dip dye which 'makes her look like an Afghan hound'

The teen is now taking the salon to court, saying they only offered her a £40 refund and 'refused to take any of the blame' for the style

'I will have to have about five inches cut off and that will be the shortest I have ever had it.

'I have taken a lot of photos because we are taking the salon to court because they have only agreed to give £40 back.

'The salon manager is refusing to take any blame so it is going all the way to court now.'

At the time, the teen took to Facebook to complain about her hairstyle, posting: 'Wow! thank you Decisions hairdressing for producing this three gradient hair colour!

'Putting a level 1 trainee on my hair and I really enjoyed sitting there for 6 hours to miss my own 18th birthday party that cost £600!

'Well done ladies! you really know 
about customer service! especially missing the cut, and not even 
shampooing my hair! amazing result. Lets put a level 1 on wedding hair! 
that sounds like an amazing idea doesn’t it!'

In
 another angry post she added: 'Majorly gutted the hairdressers pretty 
much ruined my evening of being 2 hours late to my 18th, nevertheless 
was an amazing night thank you to everyone who came and got me drinks, 
cards and presents and to my dad who paid for it all, especially my 
beatles cake!'

Many of Miss Kearns' friends took to Facebook in support.

Leanne
 Boden - who paid for the teen's hairdo said: 'The 
hairdresser said it was nice before we left, she even took herself a tip
 and took £90 of my pre-paid money instead of £85... do u think i have 
bn robbed?'

The salon in Basford, Stoke-on-Trent. Salon manager Candice Lindsay says the stylist behind the look has apologised and the family have been offered a partial refund

'I
 paid £18 for mine aswell, 6 hours later it had all fallen down so i did
 it myself but i don’t mind, they had created such a homely atmosphere, 
they had even placed a couple of their hyperactive children in the salon
 to run around moaning n messing with everything including the foils in 
paige’s hair... i felt right at home.

'She
 was just learning her level two, but was totally unsupervised, she 
asked for help several times but was refused it as she “had to do it 
some time."'

The stylist behind the 'terrible' cut, Sarah-Jane Mascia, has said she is 'upset' the teen didn't like her hair and that she wasn't qualified to do the style

Olivia
 Edge said: 'They shouldn’t have put a level 1 on your hair not even 
meant to do anything on level one other than the basic hairdressing 
stuff.

'Cutting and 
colouring is level 2 this is absolutely disgusting that a professional 
hairdressers would even do this to someones hair. If this was me id be 
demanding every little bit off my money back.

Vikki Loraso said: 'Go back and demand your money back that is appalling paige!'

Amy
 Statham said: 'God I did a better job doing this myself! Make sure they
 pay paige! Disgusting. Luckily on the picture I saw of you you still 
looked lovely.'

Ritta Baker said: 'Oh dear. Wouldn’t have had that prob if u came to my salon xxx.'

The stylist behind the 'terrible' cut was Sarah-Jane Mascia, 29, who responded to the criticism by saying: 'I’m studying for my level two qualification and this was level three work. It’s almost like running before you can walk.

'I was upset because I did my best and I know it wasn’t good enough but someone else should have taken over.

'When I looked at the hair I thought the colour was fine. It was the dip dye that looked bad because it had been rushed. I feel let down and everyone at college knows it was me who did the girl’s hair.'

Salon manager Candice Lindsay, 27, said: 'I was not in the salon at the time. The junior stylist was very upset after the family complained as she knew she had made a mistake and she apologised. I offered the family a partial refund, which they refused.'
