He is one of the world’s most acclaimed conductors, whose concerts in the UK and Russia are celebrated for being among the best orchestral performances of the modern age.

So a concert with performances  from famous musicians and his close friends was a fitting way to celebrate Valery Gergiev’s 60th birthday.

Mr Gergiev, the principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), carefully planned the programme for the special Gala at London’s Barbican Hall, and described the evening as ‘full of joy’.

The night was hosted by his close friends the Viscount and Viscountess Rothermere and the event supported by the Rothermere Foundation in memory of the Third Viscount, who was passionate about music and a good friend of Maestro Gergiev.

Lord Rothermere, Chairman of the Daily Mail and General Trust, publisher of the Daily Mail, said: ‘It was a privilege and honour to be able to celebrate his birthday in my Dad’s honour.’

He went on to describe how his father respected Mr Gergiev as ‘a genius and friend... whose very essence is music’.

The sold-out event featured two soloists in the first half of the concert who are particularly special to Mr Gergiev; his long-time friend and musical partner, the pianist Alexander Toradze, and the violinist with whom he has often shared the LSO platform in London and abroad, Leonidas Kavakos.

The second half was devoted to opera with a performance of the fifth act from Hector Berlioz’s The Trojans – a personal favourite of Mr Gergiev.

Ekaterina Semenchuk, who sang the 
part of Dido (mezzo soprano), said: ‘It was such a great honour to 
perform on stage with Gergiev, one of the few moments of my life I will 
honour forever.’

Mr Gergiev, who received a standing ovation at the end of the  concert, said: ‘Tonight has been full of joy.’

The Rothermere Foundation has supported the LSO for ten years and the Gala was also attended  by Lord Rothermere’s sisters, the Hon Mrs Camilla Cameron, the Hon Geraldine Harmsworth and Mrs Sarah Holcroft.

All proceeds from the evening supported the LSO’s Moving Music Campaign which will mean five performances each year will be filmed and seen by more than one million people worldwide, allowing new audiences to see LSO concerts and particularly those who might not be able to afford tickets or be able to travel to London.

Mr Gergiev has a notoriously busy schedule.

He is also the artistic director of the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg, and his birthday was also marked by the opening of  the new $700million state-of-the-art Mariinsky II opera house.

Mr Gergiev made his debut with the LSO in 1988 and has performed regularly with the orchestra since their highly-acclaimed Prokofiev symphony cycle in 2004.

He was appointed Principal  Conductor in 2007, performing a Debussy, Stravinsky and Prokofiev series with the LSO.
