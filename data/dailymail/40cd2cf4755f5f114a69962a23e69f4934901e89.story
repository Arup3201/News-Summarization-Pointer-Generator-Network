Sir Patrick Stewart has revealed that he feels Britain is ‘careless about ageing’.

The Star Trek actor said we should learn from the example of California, where healthy living is a priority and men are not afraid of moisturising.

Speaking to US magazine AARP – the 
equivalent of Saga  – Sir Patrick said living in California for 17 years
 came  at ‘a critical time’ for him.

The 73-year-old said: ‘I fell into that world of taking care  of yourself, eating sensibly, drinking lots of fluids, exercising, putting on moisturiser in the morning.

‘We’re doing better in the UK now but I think for a long time we were careless about ageing.’
