The castle where Queen Victoria honeymooned in Perthshire is set to be turned into a luxury six-star hotel.

Work was due to begin today at the 19th century Taymouth Castle at Kenmore, with the new hotel expected to open in six months.

It is hoped that the estate will become one of Scotland's most exclusive retreats.

Plans for the hotel include selling rooms to guests in timeshare style - giving guests the opportunity to ‘buy a bit of a castle.’

In 2004, it was reported that plans to redevelop the castle as a luxury hotel with 150 rooms had been approved by Perth and Kinross Council.

However, work stopped in late 2006 and in April 2009 the company restoring Taymouth Castle was declared insolvent.

Former police inspector turned property developer Robin Barrasford has now taken over the project and is planning to invest £3.2million renovating the historic building, which has already received £23million to help with restoration.

The castle and its contents were sold in 1922 and it became a hotel with a James Braid-designed 18-hole golf course.

The site operated as a Polish hospital during the war and was later leased to a civil defence school.

The 450-acre estate had been described as one of Scotland’s most beautiful properties before it fell into disrepair.

Mr Barrasford says his experience in developing similar projects around the world, including two castles in France, will stand him in good stead.

He believes he can deliver the project - and a huge jobs boost for the local area - while the people who came before had to contend with the global financial crash. 

The hotel rooms will be available in a timeshare capacity, so guests can have them for a certain number of weeks each year

Mr Barrasford, 44, a former teacher and police inspector based in Devon, said: ‘They had really great motives without the ability to create an end product.’

He said he had been working away for around a year ‘behind the scenes’ but is now ready to go public about his involvement at Taymouth.

He said: ‘I have never seen anything like this, without doubt it is the most wonderful opportunity I have seen in hotel/holiday homes.’

Mr Barrasford gave up his career in the police to spend more time with his family, and has been involved in delivering 2500 holiday properties in 10 countries over the past decade.

He said he is keen to move on with the project - and claimed the golf course should be open by the end of March and the hotel ready for a ‘soft launch’ in six months.

Work was set to begin today on the 13 rooms in the main castle, paving the way for the east wing which will have 42 rooms sold on a ‘fractional’ basis.

Mr Barrasford says this is a model which has worked well in America and involves paying £30,000 to own one thirteenth of a room for four weeks a year.

He already has strong interest from people who have already bought from him before - particularly Scottish ex-pats.

He added: ‘For anyone with Scottish lineage, it is a chance to buy a bit of a castle. You end up with hundreds of owners, not one faceless entity.’

Mr Barrasford has Scottish roots and family in Dunblane. He says that locals are supportive of his plans.

Mr Barrasford he is also keen that all the staff recruited will be Scottish-based.

He added: ‘We have a Michelin star at one of the castles in France, that is something we will aim for at Taymouth.’
