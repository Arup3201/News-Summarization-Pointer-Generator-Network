Shock: Ms Barry (pictured with her mother Jane Birkin and half-sister Charlotte Gainsboroug) was found soon after 6.30pm on Wednesday in the 16th arrondissement of the French capital

Sources say she fell 80ft from a window of her apartment, where anti-depressants were found inside.

It is just a few miles from the flat where Ms Birkin herself now lives on Paris's Left Bank.

Ms
 Barry was thought to be alone inside the flat before the tragedy 
happened, and anti-depressants were said to have been found by police.

'The
 matter is under investigation, but we can confirm the death,' said a 
local police spokesman. He said the front door of the floor was found 
locked.

France's culture 
minister paid a moving tribute to Ms Barry today, offering 'heartfelt 
and loving thoughts' to 'a family we all love, the French love'.

pictures, staging, light and composition'.

Ms
 Barry is also survived by a son, Roman de Kermadec, who is 26. Her 
half-sister was actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, the daughter of Ms Birkin 
and the late French singer Serge Gainsbourg.

Ms
 Birkin, who also has a daughter called Lou Doillon with the director

Kate Barry came from a family in the public eye.

Her mother Jane Birkin, who starred in Death on the Nile, became a sex symbol for her 13-year love affair with the French singer Serge Gainsbourg.

The pair never married but Gainsbourg raised Ms Barry like a father.

Their daughter Charlotte Gainsbourg has released four albums and is a French film star.

Meanwhile Ms Barry's father John Barry wrote all the most famous music of James Bond, including the opening theme and the hit songs for Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever, both sung by Shirley Bassey.

Earlier this year, she said: 'I've never had a week without having all three of my daughters on the telephone.

'My eldest daughter, Kate, looks most like me. She's a photographer. She had a Polaroid camera in her hand from a young age and photographed her sisters all the time.'

Ms Barry's parents separated in 1967, the year she was born in London, and she was brought up until the age of 13 by Ms Birkin and Gainsbourg, who died in 1991.

At 17, she underwent treatment for drug and alcohol addiction in central London.

She had a close relationship with groups including Alcoholics Anonymous and set up a centre for addicts in France in 1993.

Ms Barry began her career as a professional photographer in 1996 and her first major exhibition was at the Bunkamura Gallery in Tokyo in 2000.

She went on to produce pictures for a variety of publications including British Vogue and the Sunday Times magazine.
