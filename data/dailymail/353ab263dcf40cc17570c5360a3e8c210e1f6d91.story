Who do Britons dream of sitting next to at 30,000feet? The royal family, David Beckham and George Clooney top the list according to a new survey commissioned by London City Airport. 

Kate Middleton proved the favourite royal of those questioned, followed by Prince Harry, whose potential for in-flight banter was no doubt what pipped his brother Prince William to the post for second place. The Queen herself came in third.

13.5% of people would most like to fly alongside the royal family, with Kate Middleton in the number one spot and Prince William in third place

A host of celebrities fill the remainder of the top ten famous faces that would fill a fantasy flight.

A-list stars of days gone by, including Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley featured highly stealing more than 12 per cent of the vote each, while Winston Churchill shared fourth place with the very much alive David Beckham, who won 11.1% of the vote. 

Swoon in the sky: 7% of passengers asked would like to fly next to Johnny Depp, making him the 9th most popular celebrity, while 6.5% put George Clooney in 10th place

 

Johnny Depp and George Clooney, who were in ninth and tenth place, with 7% and 6.5% of the vote respectively, also made the grade.

And passengers who don't win any friends in the skies? A bad smell is the least attractive quality to British people with 48.2% of those surveyed citing a companion’s bad body odour as their number one gripe.

However, it seems us Brits are the least concerned about a stinky seatmate when it comes to our European cousins. 70% of Swiss participants admit they can’t bear BO along with 64% for the Spanish, 61% of Italians and 53% of Irish passengers.

It’s no great shock that notoriously prudish Britons list canoodling as an in-flight annoyance with 5.2% of people saying they wouldn’t like to sit next to an amorous couple on an aeroplane. Surprisingly though, passion-loving Italians are with us on that one, with 5% saying no way to wandering hands in the next seat, while the Swiss and Spanish remain non-plussed by in-flight naughtiness.

It wasn't just today's celebrities who were on the top ten fantasy passenger list: Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley made it on there along with Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill

Unsurprisingly, most people asked were reasonably irked by children kicking the back of their seat, but it’s the British and Irish who have the least tolerance with as many as 20% and 27% respectively expressing a dislike of children putting the boot in. 

If you do find yourself travelling with a child, perhaps hope to sit them behind someone Swiss, as they were the least bothered with only 11% complaining.

‘When 30,000ft up in the sky, we get pretty up close and personal with our fellow passengers and if you’re sitting next to somebody you’re not keen on it can make for a long flight’, a spokesperson for London City Airport, which commissioned the survey, said. 

‘Consider those around you, make sure you’re smelling fresh, don’t fall asleep and keep chewing to a minimum,' was the sage advice offered.
