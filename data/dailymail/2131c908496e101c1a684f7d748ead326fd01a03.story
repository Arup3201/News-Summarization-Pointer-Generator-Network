Jill Mourning: The part-time model was a victim of sex trafficking and has opened up about her experience to provide relief for other victims

A part-time model who was the victim of sex trafficking in the southern states of America has opened up about her traumatic experience to educate and provide relief for other victims.

Jill Mourning, then age 19, was used to traveling with her manager across the country on modeling jobs. However after a few months, he began to bring men into her varying hotel rooms, who would then rape her, and sell videos of the rape online.

Scared into submission, Miss Mourning told the Charlotte Observer that she initially kept quiet about her ordeal because, 'It was like, holy 
crap, everything I’ve worked so hard for could be taken away from me, 
because people will think that I did something to deserve this. And I 
was not about to let that happen.'

In 2007, Miss Mourning became a model through ModelMayhem.com, an online forum where aspiring 
models connect with others in the industry.

After
she posted portfolio pictures of herself on the site, a woman 
contacted her about a manager who was interested in representing her.

'And I of course said yes,' Miss Mourning, now 25, said. 'What 19-year-old wouldn’t?'

She said she met her new manager in 
Charlotte, North Carolina over a period of several months, where he systematically 
built up her trust; booking modeling jobs for her, as well as taking the time 
to listen, and give advice, when she was having problems with her parents.

The student, who was voted East Lincoln High School’s Most 
Excellent Teenager during her senior year, explained: 'It all felt very legitimate.'

However in the spring of 2007, while she was sleeping in an Arizona hotel, Miss Mourning woke to her manager and two other 
men entering her room with a tripod and video camera.

Dazed, she thought she had 
overslept her call-time for the cigar company photoshoot, she said. But 
her manager proceeded to pin down her arms, while another man fastened her
ankles.

'I realized something bad was about to happen,' she recalled, explaining that the three men took turns raping her, and videotaped the act - to sell on the 
Internet and blackmail her with, she said.

'And the next day, I was to shoot like 
nothing had happened. My 
manager actually said to me, "This is business as usual. This is just 
business; don’t take it personally."'

This scenario played out repeatedly in Charlotte and several other cities across the country, from May 2007 until October of the same year. Miss Mourning said she felt trapped; believing that her manager was 
too powerful and knew too much about her to get herself out of the situation safely.

'I decided I wasn’t going to tell 
anybody; I was going to compartmentalize,' she added, saying that she was terrified she would be judged if people found out.

Anti-trafficking activists and 
authorities explained that traffickers will use fear, manipulation and blackmail 
to take advantage of their victims, who are often made exceedingly vulnerable by their age, ethnicity or socioeconomic status.

'People don't know 
this problem exists, [or] they think it’s 
only in poor, third-world countries in Africa'

The trafficking of Miss Mourning finally stopped when her
manager was arrested for an unrelated financial crime and was sentenced
to ten years in prison.

She kept her ordeal a secret until 2011 when she decided to tell her grandmother, Suzanne Zucker, who had 
raised Miss Mourning for most of her childhood. Ms Zucker, who lives outside of 
Columbus, Ohio, said had never suspected anything was wrong during her granddaughter's time as a model.

After a failed suicide 
attempt and extensive counseling, Miss Mourning says she is not ready to file 
charges against the man who forced her into sex trafficking - despite the authorities possessing evidence of the act, which they found online.

An FBI agent has spoken to her about prosecution, but she is unable to relive those terrible months of her life, she said. 'To go back now, when I am in such a 
good place – reliving all of the evidence, watching the videos – to go 
back to that would be really, really tough,' she explained.

Instead, she has found healing in raising awareness.

Miss Mourning is part of a community of local activists, law enforcers and civic groups dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and providing relief for Charlotte victims.

In July last year, she founded All We Want is LOVE - Liberation of Victims Everywhere, a nonprofit that aims to educate youth about human trafficking.

She has spoken in schools and churches, 
put together student-run human trafficking awareness groups 
for colleges and high schools, and organized fundraisers for All We Want 
is LOVE.

Miss Mourning said: 'I want to use my 
experience to make people aware. I realized how many people didn’t know 
this problem exists, and the people who do know it exists think it’s 
only in poor, third-world countries in Africa.

'You need to have kids understand trafficking so they don’t become victimized,' she said.

January marks National Human Trafficking and Slavery Prevention Month, and on Friday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of North Carolina hosted a conference on human trafficking - part of a new effort to combat what authorities call a growing problem in North Carolina and across the country.

A special human trafficking task force was formed last year and is currently investigating ten 
to 12 trafficking cases across North Carolina.

Charlotte has one of the highest rates of trafficking in the U.S., according to 
anti-trafficking groups, which say that the city’s growing immigrant 
community, teamed with its major sports events, franchises, and easy highway access are all factors in attracting human traffickers.

Authorities have labelled trafficking a 'hidden 
crime;' one that is increasingly hard to uncover or prosecute.

Lia Bantavani, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, said that while sex trafficking often takes place in massage 
parlors and strip clubs, most often it is through online escort services, which she called 'cheap and anonymous' to advertise. 

'There are fewer ways for the so-called pimps to get caught,' she said.

For the third year in a row, President Obama has declared January 2013 as National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, urging 'all residents to actively participate in the efforts to both raise awareness of and end all forms of human trafficking in our communities.'
