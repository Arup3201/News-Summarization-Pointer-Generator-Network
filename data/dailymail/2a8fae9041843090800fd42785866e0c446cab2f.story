A Texas woman awaiting sentencing in the shooting death of her husband has revealed that she accepted a plea deal so she could be released on parole quickly and get on with her life.

Michele Williams, 44, a twice-divorced Dallas woman dubbed in the media 'the black widow of Keller,' was arrested in 2012 for the murder of Gregory Williams, who was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head in the couple's tony home.

Initially, Mrs Williams claimed that an intruder broke in, hit her over the head with a wrench and then murdered her husband.

But police found no sign of forced entry, so Michele Williams changed her story, alleging that her 40-year-old spouse took his own life, and that she covered up his suicide for the sake of their 4-year-old daughter.

On a 911 call placed by Michele Williams October 13, 2011, the woman sounded hysterical and was sobbing so loudly that the emergency operator could hardly make out what she was saying.

But in the course of a three-month investigation into the killing, police were able to untangle the wife’s web of lies.

According to law enforcement, Mrs Williams sedated her husband and shot him from one foot away after turning up the volume on the TV in the affluent Dallas suburb of Keller. The couple’s child slept through the entire ordeal. 

The wife then allegedly struck herself with a wrench and made the 5,000-square-foot home seem like it was the site of a home invasion.

Detectives noticed a number of details that did not add up: Michele Williams was fully dressed with her hair done when they came, even though she said she was sleeping; the gun used in the murder was found on the premises but had no fingerprints on it; and the $20,000 in cash the couple had in the house had not been stolen. 

In the days after the murder, those close to the newly minted widow were surprised by her conduct and demeanor, CultureMap Dallas reported..

The
 very next day after the slaying, Michele went out for a big breakfast 
at IHOP. She then took her children on a week-long vacation, where she 
went to sports bars and out shopping for Halloween costumes.

Williams
 also wasted no time selling off her husband’s assets, including the 
client list from his computer company and the Blueberries frozen yogurt 
shop he had bought for her.

Eight
 months after Gregory's death, Michele started dating her older son's 
friend Gene Wallis, a bodybuilder and fitness instructor 15 years her 
junior.

Together the 
couple opened a Kettle Bell fitness studio in Bedford, which they have 
been promoting online with Michele adopting the name Shelley.

Speaking to the Star-Telegram this week in a jailhouse interview, an emotional Michele Williams said that if she were to go on trial, her chances of being acquitted would have been about 50/50.

'It can go either way. Win big. Lose big,' she said. 'With a plea deal, I’m looking at a couple of years before I’m out for parole.'

The 44-year-old mother pleaded guilty in October to tampering with evidence and deadly conduct.

Prosecutors have said they decided to offer Williams a plea deal because she had destroyed material evidence needed to prove an intentional murder beyond a reasonable doubt, including wiping down her home with bleach after her husband’s death.

With her perfectly manicured nails freshly painted pink, a tearful Williams described her marriage to Gregory – her third husband – as 'wonderful' and insisted that she still loves his 'so much.' She noted that Tuesday marked the eighth anniversary of their first date. 

At the time of her plea deal, the 44-year-old widow was pregnant with twins fathered by her young boyfriend, Gene Wallis.

Last week, a judge learned that the woman was no longer pregnant following an apparent miscarriage and ordered her jailed until her sentencing hearing in April.

Williams, who had been out on bond until last Thursday, is currently being held in a single cell due to the high profile of her case.

With tears gleaming in her eyes, Williams spoke of sitting in a tiny locked room for hours and hours on end with nothing to do. 

But the 44-year-old admitted that she is terrified of going to prison and being housed in a cell with other inmates.

‘I’m not a criminal and the fear of being in with people who are…’ she trailed off.

However, she noted that she is 'looking forward to getting the sentenced over with' so she could be reunited with her daughter.

Williams added that she plans to take classes to help pass the time and use her skills as a personal trainer.

Outcome: Under her her agreement with the prosecution, Williams pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and deadly conduct in the death of Gregory Williams (pictured)

The suspect is looking at two years for the deadly conduct charge and four-and-a-half years for evidence tampering, but she could get time off for good behavior.

‘That sounds like a lifetime but it’s not 12 years, or 25 or 99,’ Williams said, bursting into tears.

Gregory Williams' ex-wife was outraged by the conditions of Michele’s plea agreement, saying that the prosecutors should have put her on trial for murder.

‘What kind of crap is that?’ Kathy Williams fumed. ‘She killed him but she's saying she took [the plea] because she has a daughter to raise. Bull crap!’

The woman vowed to attend every one of Michele’s parole hearings and do everything in her power to ensure that she serves her full sentence.
