As thousands of fans and the world’s paparazzi lined the canals in Venice last weekend, there was clearly one star draw: Hollywood’s most famously fanciable film star, George Clooney, was marrying at long, long last.

But as the pictures of the state-like, four-day ceremony flooded in, it became clear that all eyes were not, in fact, on the Oscar-winning silver fox. Instead, they were on his new wife, Amal Alamuddin, and her string of incredible outfits.

In the space of one weekend, not only did Amal become Mrs Clooney, she also became an international fashion icon.

Kate looks like a summery milkmaid in a short-sleeved lace dress by Australian brand Zimmerman, on tour Down Under. Meanwhile Amal, in her first post-wedding appearance on Sunday, updates the style with a leg-flashing, long-sleeved, racy and lacy white Giambattista Valli haute couture dress, teamed with his golden Specchio slingbacks

Classic Kate is shipshape at the National Maritime Museum in a navy and white dress by British stalwart Jaeger. But in the same colours, Amal is simply stunning in a Stella McCartney trouser suit

Kate is sugar-almond sweet in a pink dress by Emilia Wickstead at a palace garden party. Amal in the same colour looks to have stepped straight out of a fashion shoot in her sassy Sixties-style frock

And, as one winning outfit after another appeared — from a fiery scarlet floor-length gown to a wonderful white lace creation — fashionistas were quick to compare her with the style queen whose crown she appears to have stolen: the Duchess of Cambridge.

For while the two women are equally adept at smart, chic fashion, Amal, it seems, is outdoing Kate in every way.

When Kate, 32, chooses a pretty, long-sleeved, white lace frock, Amal, 36, takes the same shape but adds bold boning and bright pink flowers.

While Kate loves vibrant shades of pink and red, Amal takes exactly the same hues but swaps Kate’s straight, pencil-skirt fit for a flared shape or updates it with a more modern cut.

While the fiery red of Kate’s Beulah gown is striking, the billowing sleeves make it old fashioned — especially compared with Amal’s firecracker version at her wedding rehearsal dinner in Venice

Pre-marriage Kate is the innocent country lass in her floral dress and pink cardigan. Yet Amal manages to look powerful and flowerful in a colourful Oscar de la Renta dress and brave yellow pumps in Florence

Where Kate does safe, smart and sometimes staid, Amal lifts the look and applies a whirl of modern-meets-timeless.

Perhaps Amal’s serious job, as a human rights lawyer at London’s distinguished Doughty Street Chambers, encourages her to be fun and frivolous when it comes to off-duty fashion.

In court, she must wear the dowdy barrister’s uniform of black and white under heavy robes and itchy horsehair wig — meaning she can only show off her style credentials away from the workplace.

Kate is ladylike in a scarlet Catherine Walker coat and dress worn with her trusty nude platforms. Amal is smart but modern, too, in a Paule Ka suit, while striking floral slingbacks give a dash of surprise

No such escape awaits Kate, of course, as she is constrained by royal protocol at all times. She is also naturally conservative, as befits the future Queen, and always chooses safe, appropriate attire. 

So where Amal likes short skirts, Kate sticks to knee-length, and while Amal experiments with flares and jeans, Kate rarely wears trousers in her public life.

Kate can sometimes look a little frumpy. At least, that is the effect when seen against Amal, with her impeccable knack of giving her wardrobe a clever twist. 

Kate is safe and suitable in a sparkly, tweed suit by New Zealand designer Rebecca Taylor at an official reception. Amal wears a similar Paule Ka suit for work, but with a hipper, trendier cut, giving a flash of cleavage

In black velvet by Alexander McQueen, Kate is reminiscent of a pre-marriage Princess Diana. Her dress is eye-catching, until you see Amal’s similar, but racier, Dolce & Gabbana satin gown, with fabulous earrings

Amal has a youthful, devil-may-care approach: she is unafraid of ripped jeans, camouflage, jumpsuits, eccentric jewellery, floppy hats, short shorts and things that drape rather than cling. 

She also doesn’t mind exposing a bit of flesh. So Amal’s skirts are that bit shorter than Kate’s, and her shoes are that bit higher and glitzier than the Duchess’s sensible footwear choices.

If anyone marvelled at one of our biggest and best-known movie stars marrying a ‘normal’ woman in Amal, her fashion parade has shown she has oodles of movie-star glamour herself and can more than handle herself on the world stage.

The duchess is neat, chic and safe in a feminine Lela Rose peplum dress and black Jimmy Choo shoes. Amal wears white, too — but is more edgy in her less-fitted dress worn with statement necklace and platform sandals

She combines the clean, sharp lines (and big shades) of Jackie Onassis, the beauty of Sophia Loren, and the boldness of Michelle Obama with an unrestrained taste for designer fashion.

And if more proof were needed, there’s already an ‘Amal effect’: the Dolce & Gabbana monochrome dress she wore for her arrival in Venice sold out immediately, and blogs have sprung up across the internet dedicated to her wardrobe.

So while it was once impossible to conceive that anyone could out-chic Kate Middleton — just as it was unimaginable Clooney would ever remarry — Amal has achieved both in one amazing weekend.
