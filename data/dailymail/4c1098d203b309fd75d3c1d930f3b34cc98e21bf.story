The days since a runaway oil train tragically killed 50 people in a Quebec town have proved an unmitigated PR disaster for the head of the American company which owned the train.

Edward Burkhardt, president and CEO of Chicago-based Rail World Inc., has received flak from all sides for his insensitive words and actions since the derailment destroyed a large part of the border town of Lac-Megantic last weekend.

With emotions running high in the town where less than half of the dead bodies have been recovered, Burkhardt has carried out a masterclass in how not to behave if you are the CEO at the center of a disaster.

After first blaming the local fire department, Burkhardt said the accident was caused by an employee failing to lock the brakes

Burkhadt’s missteps started soon after the crash when he began to publicly speculate about the cause of the explosion.

On Tuesday, speaking on the phone from Chicago rather than at the crash site, Burkhardt blamed a local fire department for ‘tampering’ with the brakes of the train in the process of putting out a smaller fire that broke out just before the train lost control. 

The fire department angrily denied that charge and Burkhardt quickly changed his story, blaming an employee who he said had failed to properly set the brakes.

Burkhardt told reporters that the engineer, whom he didn't name, ‘was not in jail, but police have talked about prosecuting him.’

On Wednesday, four days after the accident, Burkhardt arrived in Lac Megantic and gave a bizarre press conference on the street which did nothing to enhance his reputation.

Seemingly on his own and unprepared, Burkhardt spoke in English - far from ideal in a town where French is the dominant language, reports Atlantic Wire.

‘People are always putting words in my mouth,’ Burkhardt told reporters during a rambling 45 minute conversation with media, as local residents shouted insults at him.

'We think we have plenty of responsibility here. Whether we have total responsibility is yet to be determined.’

Quebec Premier Pauline Marois has been a vocal critic of Burkhardt.

‘The leader of this company should have been there from the beginning,’ she said.

Lac-Megantic's mayor, Colette Roy-Laroche, has revealed that a hoped-for meeting with Burkhardt hasn't materialized.

'I am angry with the fact that he did not communicate with me sooner,' she said.

At Burkhardt's head office, an aide said no snub of the mayor was intended.

'There's been a misunderstanding on that issue,' said Cathy Aldana. 'Our people have been in contact with mayor's office daily, and I know Mr. Burkhardt wanted to see her personally.'

Burkhardt has also been heavily criticized in the Canadian media for talking more about how he has been personally impacted by the accident rather than how it had affected the town's residents.

His selfish approach has drawn parallels with Tony Hayward, the former CEO of British Petroleum when it caused an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

Hayward - who lost his job soon after - was widely criticized for attending a yachting race in Europe while the cleanup of the spill was under way; he too complained about the toll of that crisis on him and told reporters he wanted his life back.

Burkhardt now has a lot to do to convince his critics that he doesn’t deserve the same fate for his poor display in recent days.

On Thursday the coroner's office identified the first victim of the incident as 93-year-old Eliane Parenteau, who lived in the disaster zone in downtown Lac-Megantic.

Conditions have at least improved enough for nearly all the 2,000 residents forced to evacuate after the crash - a third of the population - to return home.

Investigators are also looking at a fire on the same train just hours before the disaster.

A fire official has said the train's power was shut down as standard operating procedure, meaning the train's air brakes would have been disabled.

In that case, hand brakes on individual train cars would have been needed.

The derailment is Canada's worst railway disaster since a train plunged into a Quebec river in 1864, killing 99.
