Are you a fan of the McChamp, McGrilled or McSpicy chicken burgers from McDonald's?

If so, you're amongst the few Australians who do eat them and it won't be for much longer. 

The products have been cut from the fast food restaurant giant's menu as it gets rid of low-selling items to make way for new  products.

McDonald's has cut the McSpicy burger from its menu as the fast food restaurant gets rid of low-selling items  

McDonald's has broadened its menu in recent years to include smoothies, frappes, grilled chicken salads and, as recently as last week, the Southwest BLT, Spicy Jalapeno, and Chicken Bacon Deluxe burger range.

But when that happens, Daily Mail Australia understands McDonald's often removes other less-popular products as part of a menu review. 

The fast food chain is looking at ways to reduce the number of items it sells. It has experienced a sales increase in Australia over the past six months.

'Part of it is frankly looking at low moving items and taking them off the menu, but some of that is looking at how we actually display and market it,' the company's chief administrative officer Pete Bensen told the Sydney Morning Herald.  

'So it could be something like maybe in the drive-thru you... only display the items that make up 80 per cent of our sales and you could significantly reduce the clutter.' 

The latest accounts for McDonald's show a 25 percent profit increase to $234.4 million across Australia's 940 or so stores. 

McDonald's plan to boost sales this year through digital initiatives and rolling out the Create Your Taste - burgers made fresh to order - in additional stores by the end of June.

'We have listened to our customers and are introducing products and concepts that are relevant to the local market,' a McDonald's spokesman said.  

'The recent introductions of McCafé in Drive Thru, and 100% Aussie rump steak to our Real Choices menu have resonated well with customers. 

And we expect that the roll out of Create Your Taste - to be introduced to all of our Australian restaurants, by June 2015 - will further drive sales and growth.'

The Spicy Jalapeno was an added addition to the McDonald's menu just last week
