Tesco is reportedly planning to launch its own tablet computer this year in a bid to win back book and DVD sales from technology giants Apple and Amazon

Tesco is reportedly planning to launch its own tablet computer this year in a bid to win back book and DVD sales from technology giants Apple and Amazon.

Priced at around £100 to compete with Amazon's Kindle Fire, the tablet is expected to come pre-loaded with content and apps including Tesco's new movie, music and eBook subscription service Blinkbox.

The supermarket has been looking to 
reinvigorate its business since annual profits fell for the first time 
in decades in April, while it was recently forced to scrap a 
high-profile expansion in the U.S.

Tesco declined to comment on the report in the Times newspaper.

A tablet computer would tie in with Tesco's other branded offerings such as its mobile phone and banking services.

As more music and film downloads are made on portable devices, it could also tackle leaking market share to technology companies through devices like the iPad.

Ovum technology analyst Nick Dillon said Tesco could either place its name on a pre-made tablet in a so-called white-label approach, or follow Amazon in creating its own operating and ecosystem.

'The risks are quite high for a 
fully-integrated strategy because Tesco is not a technology company, but
the rewards would be high too,' he said.

Tesco is not the first supermarket to dip
its toes into the lucrative tablet sector, with its rival Asda becoming
the exclusive retailer a couple of years ago for a £100 device called 
Arnova 8.

If the retailer does enter the tablet market, it could be part of a far-reaching 
turnaround plan that has already seen it snap up family-friendly 
restaurant chain Giraffe and Harris + Hoole coffee shops.

The retailer recently unveiled a new-look 'hypermarket' in Watford - one of its 
largest shops in the UK - which incorporates outlets such as Giraffe as 
it seeks to become known as a retail and leisure destination as well as a
supermarket chain.
