Measure B, a law that requires porn actors to wear condoms, has done little to protect the porn industry financially.

Ever since the law passed in Los Angeles County, permits for porns have dropped 95 per cent.

The News Daily reports that in November of last year, 480 film permits were filed in Los Angeles. This year, only 24 permits were filed, said CEO of the Free Speech Coalition, Diane Duke.

Duke said that Permits cost $,1000, and the lack thereof has cost the county of $450,000 in revenue.

The Free speech Coalition has a history of being opposed to measure B and gives the reason that actors are tested for HIV every 14 days.

Measure B doesn't require that actors get tested, and therefore could put them at risk for disease.

Measure B was enforced by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health(OSHA) to ensure the safety of porn actors.

Unfortunately, less people want to watch porns with actors wearing condoms.

Porn Actress Lily Lebeau told Slate, I wouldn't mind using condoms more. It's just not what people want to see.'

If people don't want to see it, they wont pay for it.

People are still filing porn permits, but they're doing it in neighboring towns.

'Most production companies have ceased shooting in LA County. They have other options in other states and communities,' said Diane Duke to Capitalbay.com.

The neighboring city of Camarillo issued a 45-day moratorium on porn productions because a a growing number of requests to shoot in the area caused concern for city officials.

Camarillo doesn't have a condom rule so officials called the moratorium to 'study it so we can craft certain regulations,' said assistant city attorney Don Davis.

'Now that they’ve put some restrictions on them that inhibit them, they’re trying to move out of there. We don’t want them to migrate to our area,' Camarillo councilman Mike Morgan said.

Camarillo fears that the porn industry will begin to infiltrate the community because they can't shoot elsewhere.

Linda Parks, a Ventura County supervisor, told the LA Times that residents near Thousands Oakes were complaining about an increase in porn shoots. 'People are hearing moans and seeing naked people,' she said.

Smaller production companies in L.A. may be secretly avoiding permits which poses regulation problems and keep the county from making revenue.
