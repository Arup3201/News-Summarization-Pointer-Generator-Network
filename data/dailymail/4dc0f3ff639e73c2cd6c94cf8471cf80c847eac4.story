You might be forgiven for thinking ultimate power couple Beyonce and Jay Z have taken over the modern world, but now one cunning artist is making sure they leave their imprint on the art world, too.

Displayed on Tumbler account The Carter Family Portrait Gallery, nearly every recognisable piece of artwork from the 1400s onwards has been given a makeover to incorporate the face of Queen Bey, Jay Z, and even little Blue Ivy.

And while art aficionados may shudder to see such masterpieces as Klimt’s The Kiss, Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring, and Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling defaced in such a manner, we can’t help but feel that, like most things, they are improved by the addition of the Carter family.

Artful makeover: Queen Bey is transformed into a beautiful Girl With A Pearl Earring

Original work: Girl With A Pearl Earring which was painted by Vermeer in 1665 has become one of the most well-known portraits in pop culture

The images also show what Beyonce would look like as the Queen - and the Virgin Mary.

Guest 
stars also appear in some of the paintings including Destiny's Child 
member - and Beyonce's cousin - Kelly Rowland, and Jay Z's friend Kanye 
West.

And,
 for the serious Beyonce fans out there, the pictures are available as 
prints, T-shirts, mugs, iPhone, iPad and laptop cases, tote bags, and even pillows - perfect for all those times you feel the need to nap on 
Bey’s beautiful face.

The Virgin Mary And Child has been reproduced thousands of times - but never with Beyonce and Blue Ivy
