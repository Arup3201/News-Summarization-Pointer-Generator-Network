It's not every day that a property boasting one of the most ancient wonders of the world hits the market.

Built on an expansive 431 hectares in Esperance, Western Australia, the full-size recreated Stonehenge has long been a sight to rival the real thing- and for only $5 million the granite marvel could be yours.

Kim and Jillian Beale unexpectedly became the proud owners of the unusual backyard edifice in 2009, when the replica commissioned by the quarry next to their property failed to find the funding required to transport it to the Margaret River.

The Esperance Stonehenge is the only complete life-size Stonehenge replica in the world

The edifice, along with a homestead and 431 acres, has hit the market for the asking price of $5 million

'The community was keen for it to stay, and there was some talk of the Rotary Club taking responsibility for it, but a site just didn't come up in time,' Kim told Daily Mail Australia.

'So we decided to put our hand up. There was some doubt as to whether we could make it work, but we did,' he said.

The cattle farmers erected the edifice, which is the only complete life size replica of pre-historic English structure Stonehenge made entirely of granite in the world, and decided to operate it as a tourism venture.

'It was meant to be a semi-retirement plan, but it's become so popular it's turned into a full-time job,' said Kim.

Esperance Stonehenge, hit the local tourism industry in 2010, weighing over 2500 tonnes and made of 137 stones of local pink granite from the quarry.

Since then, the unusual wonder has seen over 30,000 visitors and has made a name for itself both nationally and overseas.

The Beales have applied to  subdivide the property to separate Esperance Stonehenge from the farm they run

The homestead boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms and is just 90 metres away from the edifice

The Beales live in the two-storey farmhouse, also up for sale, just 90 metres away from the structure, gaining a view that few in the world could lay claim to. 

'We've transformed the shed into a really lovely office which overlooks the Esperance Stonehenge, and our house is right next door, so all day, five days a week I look at it,' Kim said.

The property has been on the market for a year, as the couple look for an actual retirement plan to put into action.

Advertised as Lot 35, Merivale, Esperance, the asking price is $5 million, though the Beales have applied to rezone and subdivide the property to separate Esperance Stonehenge from the beef farm they also run.

'We put it on the market because we know the age we are at. This could develop into a huge tourist precinct. If there's anyone who is passionate about tourism and something a bit different, this could be the right property for them,' Kim said.

'It's an iconic structure, and we have quite a few overseas tourists who come in and know about it. Australians might not see ancient history as something important and never know the worth of these structures,' he said.

Estate agent for the property, Ron Johnstone, described the expansive site as a unique opportunity

The Beales believe their 'once-in-a-lifetime' property will make some lucky buyer happy

Mr Beale said that visitors often take as many pictures of the cattle as they do of the structure

'We're still trying to figure out exactly how it was made- we always tell people we couldn't work it out and just cheated.'

Estate agent for the property, Ron Johnstone, described the expansive site as a unique opportunity.

'We've had quite a bit of interest, and once we get the subdivision through we may get more offers focused purely on Stonehenge or the beef far,' Mr Johnstone said.  

The property offers the best that the South Coast of Western Australia has to offer, combining the two prosperous industries of agriculture and tourism.

The beef farm supports Gelbvieh cattle stud and commercial cattle, and boasts abundant pastures which have been well tended to.

The homestead boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms

The two-storey house also offer a spacious living, dining and kitchen area with polished floorboards

'There are often cows sitting on either side of the road as people drive down. We get hundreds of people walking down the path, especially when cruise ships come through, and they spend as much time taking photos of the cattle as they do of the Stonehenge,' said Mr Beale.

With 4.7 kilometres of road frontage, not to mention rolling coastal views, the Beales believe their 'once-in-a-lifetime' property will make some lucky buyer happy.

The two-storey house also offer a spacious living, dining and kitchen area with polished floorboards.

The homestead boasts three bedrooms and two bathrooms, as well as an Australian oak hand rail on twisted steel balustrade.which leads to the family retreat.

A wall of glass and in-built balcony captures the coastal views of Esperance Bay, as well as the iconic structure the property is so well known for.
