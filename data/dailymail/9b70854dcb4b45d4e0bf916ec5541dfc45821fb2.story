Suspended: Dr Christopher Driskill allegedly kept a stash of alcohol in his office and drank on the job

A doctor has been suspended by the New Mexico Medical Board after he allegedly had sex with patients, drank alcohol on the job and left women to give birth unattended.

Dr Christopher Driskill, a married father-of-four from Hobbs, is even accused of leaving a woman in labor alone because he was busy having sex with another patient, according to the board's report, shared by the Albuquerque Journal.

He posed a 'clear and immediate danger to the public' for his multiple infractions, the board ruled.

Driskill, the incoming president of the New Mexico Medical Society, has not yet appealed the decision. The board is now considering whether to revoke his license but a hearing date has not been set.

The board's report listed a number of startling incidents, the Journal reported. He has been accused of having sex with several of his patients, including some who worked for his former practice, and of prescribing drugs to a girlfriend without proper medical records.

He also allegedly drank alcohol at work and worked while he was under the influence. He even had a stash of alcohol in his office, according to the report.

He left moms-to-be to give birth unattended on multiple occasions 'within the past few years' at Lea Regional Medical Center and was once late to work so delayed a c-section, the board said.

'Danger': The medical board ruled that the doctor posed a 'clear and immediate danger to the public'

And in other instances, he wrote lewd personal notes in medical charts of certain patients.

'Your sexual relationships and abuse of alcohol have negatively affected your practice of medicine,' the board said in its suspension notice, the Journal reported.

In August, Driskill was fired from his job at Premier Health in Hobbs and 10 days later, Premier told his other workplace, the Lea Regional Medical Center, of his termination.

He had by then requested a temporary leave of absence and has not returned to work since - but he failed to tell the board about his termination and leave of absence, as is protocol.

The doctor was 'president-elect' of the New Mexico Medical Society and was expected to become president of the society in May.

A representative from the organization, which represents the majority of physicians in New Mexico, said it would not comment on the matter until after the hearing.

Records show he is married to wife Nancy Ann, and they have four children of school age together. He has not responded to requests for comment.
