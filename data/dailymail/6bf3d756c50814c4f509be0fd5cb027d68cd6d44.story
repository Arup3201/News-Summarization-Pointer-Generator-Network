In many ways, Shirley Andrews is your average 80-year-old pensioner who lives in a retirement village and enjoys knitting and crochet.

But that's where the similarities end, as Shirley is a self-confessed cougar who has slept with more than 1,000 men.

Unwilling to stick to partners her own age, the sprightly grandma regularly has sex with men as young as 18.

Shirley Andrews, 80, from Oroville, California, has slept with 1000 men

Shirley, who lives in sheltered accommodation in Oroville, California, even has a tattoo circling her nipple that reads 'Gang Bang Queen'.

Shirley loves intercourse so much she started taking part in porn films seven years ago with much younger men.

Now she has fans from around the world who send her  messages, nude pictures - and even requests to meet her.

Shirley said: 'I started doing porn work in 2008, all amateur.

'I made all of the videos at home. And I started posting them online and I just got rave reviews. I just felt like a princess.'

Her biggest role was taking part in a filmed orgy involving fifteen much-younger men.

Among Shirley's numerous fans is Kyle Jones, a 31-year-old with a penchant for pensioners who she makes amateur films with. 

But Shirley, who has been married several times before, is not ready to settle down and currently has five guys under 30 on the go.

She said: 'I have had numerous proposals in the last five years, but none of them were with anyone I would want to spend the rest of my life with.

'I would say I've slept with around a thousand men but I think it would probably be a little bit more than that.

'I don't consider myself a nymphomaniac by any means but I'm probably close to it.'

As well as Shirley, Kyle, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is also seeing five other elderly ladies, aged between 68 and 92. 

He regularly travels from the east coast across to California and down to Florida to visit his many women.

They include 92-year-old great-grandmother Marge from Pennsylvania who works as an exotic dancer, and a 68-year-old widow called Anna from Ohio who has reignited her sexual passion since meeting adventurous Kyle.

They met on an online dating site a few years after her husband died - much to her daughters' displeasure.

Kyle's little black book of women appears on a one-off Channel 5 special called Nanna Love: 50 Shades of Granny about young men who prefer mature women to girls their own age.

Out of all of Kyle's mature lovers, wild Shirley is his favourite.

The pair met on the Internet and live 2,000 miles apart - which means they rarely get to spend time together.

But while Shirley is content with playing the field, Kyle may be considering his future with his favorite lady.

He said: 'Shirley knows that I would have a problem being with just one woman and I know that Shirley will have a problem with just one guy.

'And even though I'm with other women, I don't know if I'll be okay with it with her.

'Let's say at some point where I decide I'm just really super in love and I only want her, then it might mess with my head at some point that she was with someone else.'

Despite Shirley's unusual bedroom activities, she enjoys much of the same hobbies as her friends.

She said: 'I currently live in a senior complex. I love to knit - I'm always knitting, crochet as well. I make a lot of gifts that way.

'Plus it keeps me busy and out of trouble. It seems to be my middle name - trouble.'
