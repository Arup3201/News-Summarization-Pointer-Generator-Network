While at first glance these pictures might seem like another bizarre Chinese game show task, they actually have a very serious message.

Organised by the Hunan Cancer Hospital, the stunt aimed to raise awareness- and thus garner donations- for breast cancer in China.

Men were put in the mastectomy bras worn by women who have lost either one or both breasts to cancer, and asked to perform basic tasks such as carrying buckets of water and skipping to demonstrate the difficulties faced by survivors and patients .

However, the resulting pictures of the men bouncing around in bras in front of a pink backdrop have drawn criticism from many who accuse the campaign of making light of the serious disease, or simply of being 'creepy'.

Users of China's biggest social network Weibo have been speaking out against the campaign.

One - identified on Weibo as LienKo35 - said: 'This is deeply creepy. There is a serious message to deliver about breast cancer in China and they put on what looks like a gimps' convention, adding, 'Why not have real women there telling their real stories? Who cares what a middle aged businessman thinks or how he feels.'

Others call the event 'perverted' or accuse it of being too light-hearted for the message it is trying to convey.

But the Hunan Cancer Hospital is standing by its awareness-raising stunt.

The Metro reports that Spokesman Long She said: 'It was intended to be a way to show men how women who've had mastectomies suffer when they're doing ordinary household things day in day out.'

He added: 'We think we put over a serious message in a way people will remember.'

The hospital, situated in Changsha, Hunan, is a leading research and treatment centre for all types of cancer.

According to a recent report by the World Health Organisation, China is one of the country's worst hit by rising cancer rates since 2012, while China Daily reports that only 50 per cent of women could name some tell-tale signs of breast cancer.
