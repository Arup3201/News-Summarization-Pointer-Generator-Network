A barrister and part-time judge today denied perverting the course of justice in connection with the Chris Huhne case.

Judge Constance Briscoe appeared before the Old Bailey in London accused of two counts of intending to 
pervert the course of public justice, relating to statements made to 
police.

She allegedly gave two inaccurate statements to Essex Police during their investigation into allegations the then Lib Dem Energy Secretary Chris Huhne had got his ex-wife Vicky Pryce to take his speeding points.

In the documents, the barrister and 
recorder - or part-time judge - is said to have falsely claimed she had 
no dealings with the press.

Briscoe, who has been suspended from 
the judiciary since her arrest last October, is also accused of altering
 a copy of her witness statement before claiming it was correct.

The
 56-year-old will stand trial at Southwark Crown Court on January 14. 
Briscoe was bailed after today's hearing until the start of the trial.

The first charge alleges that between 
May 16 2011 and October 6 2012 Briscoe provided police with two 
statements that were inaccurate.

The second alleges that on October 6
 she produced a copy of her witness statement that had been altered and 
maintained it was the correct version.

After
 her charge in June the barrister, of Clapham, 
south-west London, said she was 'deeply distressed' by the allegations 
and vowed to fight them in court.

Huhne
 and his ex-wife Vicky Pryce received eight-month prison sentences after
 it emerged that she had taken driving penalty points for him a decade 
ago.

The former energy 
secretary pleaded guilty on the first day of a planned joint trial in 
February, and economist Pryce was later convicted by a jury. Both have 
now been released from jail.
