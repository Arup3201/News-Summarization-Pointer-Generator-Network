American scientists have created a 
wearable computer for dogs that they say could allow man's best friend 
to send messages to handlers.

The technology might initially sound barking mad, but its creators at Georgia
 Institute of Technology believe that it will give crime dogs and other K-9s a clearer and more direct way to communicate with their handlers.

The Google Glass-inspired technology for hounds may even let us humans view the world through a dog's eyes.

While gadget lovers await the commercial release of Google Glass in 2014, Thad Starner, the technical leader on Google's upcoming eyewear, has teamed up with scientists at the Institute to develop a computerised harness to aid working dogs, the MIT Technology Review reports.

The project, titled FIDO (Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations), could allow a bomb-sniffing, cadaver or other working dog to activate a sensor which would then send information to the dogâ€™s handler, according to the Review.

As of now the developers are testing a new device that allows the dog using it to activate a signal which is sent to its handler through an earpiece.

The FIDO system works by the dog 
activating a sensor on the its vest or collar to transmit a verbal 
command, which the handler can hear through an earpiece of see on a 
head-mounted display, perhaps like Google Glass.

The researchers fitted a dog vest 
with an Arduino microprocessor and tested four different sensors that 
dogs could activate by tugging, biting or simply putting close to their 
mouths.

Professor Melody Jackson, who is working on the project has been training assistance dogs for around 18 years, said that working 
dogs talking part in the early study quickly learned to trigger the 
sensors to set off a tone.

The results of the trial will be published in a paper and presented at the International Semantic Web Conference in October.

Better communication: The project, titled FIDO, could allow guide dogs and bomb-detecting dogs to activate a sensor which would then send information to their handler

Eventually the technology could transmit video from a dogâ€™s perception to a human viewer, the Review reported.

Associate Professor Melody Jackson said that service dogs that tested the gadget quickly got the hang of the sensors, which they were able to activate by using their mouths.

She said that the FIDO 
technology could help disabled people navigate more effectively and let 
bomb-detecting dogs communicate with their handlers from a distance - 
even telling them abut a specific type of bomb that they have found.

Similarly, the scientists believe that 
the system could allow rescue dogs to alert a human team from afar when 
they have found an injured person.

Of course the technology could be of interest to pet owners too in the future.

Professor Jackson said that it could be used to let humans know when a dog is hungry or wants to go outside - perhaps even by a text message.
