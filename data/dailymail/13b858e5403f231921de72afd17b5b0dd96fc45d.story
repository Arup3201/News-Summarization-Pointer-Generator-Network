Alexis Sanchez netted Arsenal's opener against Besiktas but the £30million star's overall performance on Wednesday night highlighted the Gunners' urgent need for an out-and-out striker.

In the absence of Olivier Giroud, Sanchez was used as the Gunners go to man upfront but looked isolated and unable to create the magic Arsenal fans will have been hoping to see when the Chilean arrived at The Emirates this summer.

A world-class attacker who gave everything on Wednesday, yes, but deploying £30million Sanchez as a lone frontman is a waste of his supreme talents.

This Champions League qualifier reaffirmed Arsenal's need for a targetman - someone to goal-hang, to finish the many chances a five-man Arsenal midfield will create.

The Gunners worked hard and fully-deserved their 1-0 victory but lacked that cutting edge in the final third - Sanchez performed well and won many of his duels against defenders but isn't entirely suited to playing upfront on his own. 

With the scores at 0-0, Sanchez continued to run deeper and deeper in a bid to get on the ball and influence the game leaving Arsenal bereft of anybody to assist upfront. 

As the touch map below shows, much of Sanchez's play came from outside of the area.

Wayne Rooney shares a similar trait - when his side is in desperate need of a goal, the Manchester United frontman will also drop deep in an attempt to change the match. Both players make things happen and have the skills to do so.

Of course, Sanchez's strike came as the 25-year-old was sprinting into the box rather than standing and waiting inside it as Arsenal's tactics suggest. 

The men playing behind Sanchez - Jack Wilshere, Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey - can thread forward passes  all night long but it has little effect with no frontline to run onto the ball or hold it up.

The midfield trio must run beyond Sanchez if Arsenal are to have any luck in front of goal but that isn't happening so far this season - the Gunners look restricted and almost come to a standstill in the final third with every player seemingly keen to assist rather than be set up themselves.

As well as balls through the middle, much of the play from Arsenal's widemen is also wasted without a towering presence in the area.

New right back Mathieu Debuchy - who was to be sent off late on - whipped in an inviting cross on twenty minutes but the ball was easily cleared by the Turkish visitors as Arsenal lacked anybody in the area who could adequately challenge in the air. Nobody to ruffle the feathers of the Besiktas backline.

This was highlighted in the Gunners' 2-2 draw with Everton on Saturday. 

Sanchez was completely ineffective at Goodison Park, admittedly a tough place to play your first away game in the Premier League.

The former Barcelona man was replaced having struggled up against the powerful defensive pairing of Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin.

However, as soon as Sanchez was replaced by Giroud, Everton looked stretched and Jagielka and Distin looked anxious almost as the striker caused them problems in the air - something Sanchez was unable to do.

As it was, Giroud was the man to latch on to Nacho Monreal's cross from the left to equalise in the dying stages and salvage a point for the Gunners.

Unfortunately, Arsenal will have to do without the French international for a considerable amount of time after Giroud suffered an ankle injury. 

Many fans of the north London club were adamant the club needed another striker even with a fit Giroud - now with the No 12 set for a spell on the sidelines,  Arsene Wenger will surely have to act in the final days of the transfer window.

If Wenger fails to do so, the £30million talent of Alexis Sanchez will be completely reigned in if forced to play as Arsenal's lone frontman. 

Sanchez can score goals as well as create but would be far better playing behind the striker rather than the furthest man forward himself.
