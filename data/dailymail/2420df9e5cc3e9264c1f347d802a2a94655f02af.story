It's survived nine centuries exposed to the harshest elements of the north east.

But in the last 25 years St Helen's church in Eston, Teesside, had been virtually destroyed after being repeatedly targeted by vandals and thieves.

Local campaigners decided drastic action was neededÂ and decided to dismantle the church, brick by brick, and rebuild it 40 miles away in County Durham.

After 15 years, St Helen's church has been rebuilt brick by brick 40 miles away in County Durham

The church had been virtually destroyed by 1998 after vandals illegally demolished the vestry and stole stonework and valuables

The 15-year project is now almost complete although the church has not yet opened to the public due to a lack of funds.

Each individual brick of the church was removed from the building and numbered in 1998.

At the time historians at the Beamish Museum declared an 'amnesty' in an attempt to have returned as much of the original stone as possible, much of which had been stolen.

It took four labourers a month to dismantle the church and transport it to a site near Georgian Pockerley Manor, owned by the charity.

The blocks were stored on palettes, whilst the remaining rubble of the church was taken by skip.

The church was moved more than 40 miles from its original home in Eston, Teesside, to a site owned by the Beamish Museum in County Durham

The bricks were kept in a field while the Beamish Museum, which funded the project, waited for enough money to become available to complete the move.

The decision to transport the church followed years of vandalism, including a fire which destroyed its roofs.

The vestry was illegally demolished while stonework and furnishings, such as the font and medieval cross were stolen.

The Tudor stained glass was smashed out and in the mid 19th century a cast iron chancel window was taken for scrap.

By 1987 St Helen's was in a serious state of disrepair and in 1998 Durham County Council and English Heritage gave permission for the grade II listed building to be de-constructed and rebuilt by Beamish.

The exterior of the church has now been completely rebuilt but it has not yet been opened to the public due to a lack of money.

When finished the grounds of the church will house an 1828 hearse, believed to be the oldest in the country.

Curator of the museum, Jim Rees, said: 'The rebuild was entirely funded by ourselves and it was the lack of money or any grants towards the reconstruction which had meant that so much time had elapsed since we took it down.

'The delay in final completion is due to having run out of funds for the project.

'This does not unduly worry me as the lovely new roof and gutters are on, so it is coming to no harm.

'It still needs plastering in the nave, flagstone floors throughout, doors and windows, which will be made by our own joiners, and Georgian box pews installing, once we find some.

'All the original woodwork was of course destroyed in the fire.

The last parochial service at the church was held in 1962 but there are hopes one might be held again in the future

'Outside we need to do a lot of landscaping; more flags, the church yard wall and a 'Hearse House' to house our 19th century hearse, which I believe to be the oldest anywhere.

'The uncertainty of raising the money means that at present we are unable to set a date for public opening, although all visitors to the museum can at least view the outside of the building now.'

According to registers, St Helen's served as a parish church from medieval times, until 1884 when a larger one was built nearby.

In 1889 St Helen's became a cemetery chapel but with rapid population growth it became a parish again in the early 1920s.

The last parochial service was held in the church on December 30th 1962 before it resumed its earlier role as cemetery chapel, the last funeral was held around 1985.
