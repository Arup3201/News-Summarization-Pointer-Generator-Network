Safe standing could return to the Premier League after the Liberal Democrats revealed they will include the pledge in their 2015 General Election manifesto.

The party advocate the introduction of rail seats, which are popular in the German Bundesliga, rather than a return to terracing.

All-seater stadiums have been compulsory in the Premier League and the Championship since the start of the 1994-95 season, at the recommendation of the Taylor Report following the Hillsborough disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans in 1989.

Safety first: Rail seating will be part of the Liberal Democrats' General Election manifesto next year

'Safe standing is allowed in many other sports and we do not believe that the top level of football should be an exception,' Liberal Democrat spokesperson John Leech MP told the BBC.

'We are not calling for a return of the terraces of the 1980s. Modern safe standing areas using rail seating operate very successfully in top-tier football across Europe.'

Rail seats can be locked in an upright position to form a barrier for fans to lean against. They can then be unlocked if seating is required.

Several Premier League clubs have declared their support for a return to standing, including Manchester United.

Stand and deliver: Borussia Dortmund are among a number of German clubs who utilise rail seating

Sportsmail revealed in February that the Old Trafford club were behind the move. 

Aston Villa, Hull and Swansea have also been vocal about the issue, as has the Football Supporters' Federation.

A spokesman told the BBC: 'Football can't bury its head in the sand. Tens of thousands already stand at games.'

But the Premier League remains opposed to the idea.

They said: 'It remains the Premier League's position that stadiums should be all-seat, in line with government policy, and we will not be encouraging the government to change the law.'
