Liverpool are set to face Turkish side Besiktas in the Europa League after failing to qualify for the Champions League last 16. 

Celtic have been handed the mouthwatering prospect of a two-legged affair against 1967 European Cup final opponents Inter Milan in the last 32 of the Europa League. The Lisbon Lions beat the Italians 2-1 on the night of the club's greatest ever achievement. 

Tottenham and Fiorentina also play each other, while Everton have the easiest draws of the British teams, against Swiss side Young Boys.

Host commentator

Here's your draw in full, and it doesn't make good reading for the British clubs. 

Young Boys vs EvertonTorini vs Athletic Bilbao Sevilla vs Borussia MonchengladbachWolfsburg vs Sporting LisbonAjax vs Legia Warsaw Aalborg vs Club Brugge Anderlecht vs Dynamo MoscowOlympiacos vsTrabzonspor vs NapoliGuingamp vs Dinamo Kiev Villarreal vs SalzburgRoma vs FeyenoordPSV vs ZenitLiverpool vs BesiktasTottenham vs FiorentinaCeltic vs Inter Milan

And Celtic vs Inter Milan. The east end of Glasgow should be a little bit lively for that one! That's a repeat of some final in 1967. 

And now Tottenham are into the draw. Inter or Fiorentina left, and it's the latter. Horrible draw. 

Liverpool! Besiktas! They won't fancy that trip whatsoever! 

PSV out of the hat, with some big names left... and it's AVB's Zenit, who won the competition at the Etihad in 2008. 

Just over halfway through, and here are Roma. Against Feyenoord! Ace draw! 

Villarreal - who beat Atletico Madrid in La Liga on Sunday - host Salzburg in the first leg. 

Guingamp, in their first last 32 draw, face... Dinamo Kiev. Very beatable. 

Trabzonspor are with us, playing against Napoli. Feisty! 

Olympiacos. Nobody will want to go there. Dnipro are the unlucky ones.

Anderlecht - who've dropped out of the Champions League - next. Dynamo Moscow will be their opponents. Camera pans to Alexey Smertin, who is very much all smiles. 

Denmark's Aalborg now, and they'll come up against Club Brugge. Similarly uninspiring.

Ajax are out now, vs Legia Warsaw. 

Not a classic. 

Hello, here are Nicklas Bendtner's Wolfsburg. Against Nani's Sporting Lisbon. Battle of the Premier League flops.

Reigning champions Sevilla are next out of the hat. Borussia Monchengladbach. 

Now it's Torini, who face... Bilbao. Tasty draw for the purists, that one. 

Young Boys out first... and they play EVERTON! 

Evertonians should be absolutely delighted with that. 

'After this epic moment of the technical explanation,' Infantino starts. Erm... yeah, well epic. 

JERZY DUDEK'S IN THE HOUSE!!!

How will Liverpool fare? 'Well, they can no longer compete for the Champions League...' he says. Alright, don't rub it in. 

We're sitting through a lovely montage of goals and action from the group stage, but I'd rather they got on with it. 

Right, Infantino's spiel has begun! 

'May I extend my congratulations to all of the clubs who have made it to the round of 32,' he says. Bet they're well chuffed with that. 

It'll be interesting to see how our clubs treat this competition from now on. With the exception of Tottenham, they've struggled domestically and may see this as their real chance of a bit of silverware.

But, in the midst of a Premier League season, it's easy to just dismiss a Thursday night. 

...click above for the full Champions League draw. It went rather well for the English clubs, on the whole. 

Now, a big afternoon ahead for Tottenham, Celtic, Everton and Liverpool. There is, of course, a place in next season's Champions League up for grabs. All roads lead to Warsaw. 

All joking aside, Liverpool are the big draw when we kick off at noon, but there are a number of banana skins among this lot: Borussia Monchengladbach, Club Bruges, Besiktas, Red Bull Salzburg, Dinamo Moscow, Inter Milan, Feyenoord, Napoli, Dynamo Kiev, Fiorentina, Legia Warsaw, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Zenit.

Rather you than me, Brendan.

Want to know exactly who our four representatives can face in the last 32? Well look no further than the link above which neatly explains all. 

Right then. I've scooted over from our coverage of the Champions League draw and here we go; the one every Liverpool fan in the land wants to watch. 

It's the Europa League last 32 draw!
