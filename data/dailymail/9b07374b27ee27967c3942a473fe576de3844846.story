Didier Drogba was all smiles as he flew on a private jet after undergoing some charity work in Namibia.

The Chelsea star was in the country on a Windhoek Lager promotional tour, where he encouraged young aspiring footballers to balance their aims with getting a good education too.

Following his latest piece of charitable work in Africa, the 36-year-old uploaded a montage on Instagram of himself on the private jet before his next destination.

Accompanied with the caption: 'We Had an amazing day with extra nice people with @caroline_mc1 and @tsxlsport,' the series of pictures includes the Ivory Coast international imitating Usain Bolt's legendary 'Lightening Bolt' signature pose as he enjoys himself on the luxurious aircraft.

It won't be the first time that former African Footballer of the Year would have flown in style following an illustrious career that has included spells at Marseille, Shanghai Shenhua, Galatasaray and now his second stint at Stamford Bridge.

Speaking at a press conference in Windhoek, Namibia's capital, Drogba told the children who attended: 'The money we earn as footballers is not enough to sustain you for the rest of your life because football is just a career that can only go as far as your body can allow, so once that time comes you have to fall back on something and that something should be education.

'If you don't have an education as a footballer, how will you even negotiate your contracts or interact with people as different platforms.

'I'm saying so because today I'm here sitting in front of you expressing myself without any difficulties, I'm always part and parcel of negotiating my own contacts and various agreements such this one of Windhoek Lager. I' m also involved with many other organisations and it's all thanks to education.'

Since returning to Chelsea on a free transfer this summer, Drogba has made 13 appearances for the west London outfit - scoring three goals in all competitions so far.
