The rugged landscape that inspired the classic novel Wuthering Heights is under threat from a £15 million housing development.

A tycoon wants to build 320 homes in the middle of ‘Bronte country’ – a prospect that has alarmed conservationists.

They say the development would be ‘disturbingly close’ to Haworth Moor in West Yorkshire, which was so vividly described in the 19th Century writings of sisters Emily, Charlotte and Anne Bronte.

It was also the setting for Emily’s doomed love story about Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw.

Bradford businessman Perves Abbas, who initially wants 120 homes on land bordering the moor, is to submit a planning application in the next month.

He said: ‘I will take everything into consideration to make sure the local beauty is not lost.’

But Christine Went, heritage and conservation officer for the Bronte Society, said: ‘Large numbers of new houses would bring inappropriate development disturbingly close to the moorland fringes. We have to protect this landscape.’

John Huxley, chairman of the local parish council, added: ‘Anything that has a major impact on the appearance of the village would have an effect on our tourist industry.’

Val Slater, Bradford council’s executive member for planning, said: ‘It is vital that a balance is sought between the need for housing and the preservation of the Bronte heritage landscapes.’
