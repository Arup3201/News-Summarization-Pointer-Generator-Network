Hundreds of British pilgrims were among those being evacuated from the Roman Catholic shrine of Lourdes today following biblical-style floods.

Torrents of muddy water rushed through the historic town in south west France – stranding up to 1000 people including the sick and disabled.

Among places hit is the grotto where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared before a local girl in 1858. It was today covered by around three feet of water.

Thierry Castillo, the custodian of the Lourdes sanctuary, said: 'The space in front of the grotto is entirely flooded, with the altar under water. There are torrents of mud. The damage will cost thousands.'

'It's a very worrying situation – everybody has been told to evacuate and get on to higher ground,' said English tour guide Phil Lomas, who said there were 'numerous British parties on pilgrimage.'

'They are getting out along with everyone else – there are real safety concerns here, especially for those in wheelchairs, or who are otherwise disabled' Mr Lomas added.

'Hotels are all being cleared out, although some people are staying in higher floors because it's easy for them to wait up there. The police and other emergency services are leading the evacuation, along with priests and other clergy.'

Mr Lomas confirmed, however, that the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception – the most revered building in Lourdes remained undamaged.

It is set on high ground, and today towered above the ever-deepening water around it.

The Gave de Pau river which runs through Lourdes burst its banks following days of heavy rain, causing the widespread flooding.

French meteorologists warned that the rain is set to continue until well into next week – meaning the situation could get even worse.

The Lourdes sanctuary, which hosts 22 places of worship, was founded after 14-year-old Bernadette Soubirous claimed to have witnessed a series of visions of Mary in a cave.

Since then, people suffering illness or disability claim to have been miraculously cured by the town's spring water.

Some six million people now visit Lourdes, which is in the foothill of the Pyrenees,  every year – making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe. Many arrive every day by plane and coach from the UK.
