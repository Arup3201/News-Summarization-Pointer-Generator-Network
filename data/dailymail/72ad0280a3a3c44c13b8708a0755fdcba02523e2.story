President Obama accused Mitt Romney of 'writing off big chunks of the country' and rebuked his rival's claims that nearly half of all Americans believe they are 'victims' entitled to sponge off the government.

One the Late Show with David Letterman, Obama added that anyone seeking the presidency ought to be for 'everyone, not just for some' and talked about the hard work of single mothers and auto workers.

Obama quickly jumped on the opportunity to condemn his Republican rival's remarks on national TV as he visited New York for a glittering fundraiser hosted by A-list stars Beyoncé and Jay-Z. 

The President was responding to a secretly taped video of the Republican presidential nominee which showed Romney describing '47 per cent of the people' as Obama supporters who depend on government and believe they are victims.

'My expectation is that if you want to be president, you have to work for everyone, not just for some,' the president said on the talk show, which aired tonight.

He added: 'What I think people want to be sure of 
is you are not writing off big chunks of the country because the way our
 democracy works.'

It was Obama's first response to the Romney video, which roiled the Republican's campaign and put him on the defensive over his views about nearly half the nation.

Friends in high places: Beyoncé and Jay-Z, pictured earlier this month, hosted an exclusive fundraiser for Obama

After his television appearance, Obama spoke at a fundraising reception hosted by the music power couple at Jay-Z's 40/40 Club in Manhattan.

Tickets for the event cost $40,000 each, and the Obama campaign estimated that there were about 100 people in attendance.

The President stood on a small riser addressing an audience of men in business suits and women in evening wear, including Beyoncé's DJ sister Solange, sitting on upholstered benches in the dimly-lit club.

Beyoncé, named the world's most beautiful woman by People magazine this year, introduced the president and then sat with her husband, a hip-hop musician who has sold tens of millions of records, in the front row, looking up at Obama as he spoke.

Obama joked about the success of his hostess, comparing her charisma to that of his wife Michelle.

'Jay knows what my life is like,' he said. 'We both have daughters and our wives are more popular than we are.'

New York state is considered a safe win for Obama in the November 6 election, but the President reminded his listeners he is likely to face a barrage of negative ads in what remains a tight election.

'We've got people writing ten million-dollar checks just to see if they can beat me,' he said. 'The other side is full of passion and they are working very hard to beat us.'

Obama spoke earlier to a reception 
with approximately 200 people at the luxurious Waldorf Astoria hotel. 
Tickets for the event started at $12,500 per family.

He recalled a friend in Chicago 
telling him: '... being friends with a politician is like perpetually 
having a kid in college - because every few months, you've got to write 
this big check. Well, the good news is I'm graduating. So this is my 
last race.'

Meanwhile Romney struggled to steady 
his reeling White House campaign after a secretly recorded video showed 
him dismissing Obama's supporters - almost half the country's voters - 
as victims who are too dependent on government.

In the footage, taken during a May 
fundraiser and posted online on Monday, Romney said it is not his job 
'to worry about those people'.

He was referring to what he called Obama's locked-in supporters who believe they are 'entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.'

In response to the film, Obama told Letterman on Tuesday that when he traveled around the country he never meets anyone 'who doesn’t believe in the American dream.'

'There are not a lot of people out 
there who think they’re victims,' he said. 'There are not a lot of 
people who think they’re entitled to something.'

The president also said he did not know what Romney was even referring to with his '47 per cent reference.'

He said that when he won office four years ago, 47 per cent was the amount of voters who went for his opponent, Republican Senator John McCain.

'(Those people) didn’t vote for me 
and what I said on election night was: ''Even though you didn’t vote for
 me, I hear your voices, and I’m going to work as hard as I can to be 
your president,''' Obama said.

Obama, who, according to current 
polling, has a slight edge over Romney, said the American people work 
hard and just want politicians of both parties to work together to solve
 problems.

Controversy: Romney said his plan is to create jobs -- not government dependency -- for the '47 per cent'

'One thing I've learned as president,' Obama said, 'is that you represent the entire country.'

In the Letterman interview, he said people understand that the presidential candidates will make mistakes on the campaign trail.

Letterman reminded the president of his own slip up during the 2008 campaign, when audio from one of his own private fundraisers caught him saying that some residents of depressed rural areas get bitter and 'cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them'.

But Obama noted that he immediately apologized for the statement, unlike Romney who has defended his comments, labeling the remarks 'inelegant' but reflective of his views.
