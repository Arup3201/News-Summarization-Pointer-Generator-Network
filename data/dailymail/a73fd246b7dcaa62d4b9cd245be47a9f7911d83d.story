Hackers penetrated the Kremlin government's security system today breaking into premier Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter account to announce he was quitting.

The incident sparked a rush of web humour directed by Russians against rulers seen by many as authoritarian but who are rarely criticised in the mainstream media.

'I'm resigning,' read Medvedev's Twitter feed. 

Hackers penetrated the Kremlin government's security system today breaking into premier Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter account to announce he was quitting

'I'm resigning,' read Medvedev's microblog. 'Ashamed of the actions of the government. Excuse me'

'Ashamed of the actions of the government. Excuse me.'

The ex-president's press service rushed out a statement that the announcement was a fake.

'The Tweet on his resignation is false. We're working on the problem.'

President Vladimir Putin's press secretary had initially seemed less sure. 'I don't have any information, but I'm pretty sure that this was a hacker,' he said.

The embarrassing security lapse came as Medvedev is due today to join Putin in Crimea, annexed from Ukraine in March.

The stream of fake Tweets attacked a speech by Putin in Yalta as well as Kremlin policies in general as the country is hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine.

'Do you think that in Yalta today will say something important? I doubt. Now sitting here and thinking - what the **** for?'

'Crimea isn't ours. Please retweet,' said one.

Another said: 'We can return to the '80s. It is sad. If this the goal of my colleagues in the Kremlin, it is achieved.'

Russian citizens 'should not suffer because of problems in the perception of common sense among the top leadership of the country', the tweets continued.

Another using the name by which Putin would have been known as a child said: 'I wanted to say for a long time. Vova - you are not right!'

Yet another criticised a regulation Medvedev signed into force which will require users to register, including providing their passport information, to use public Wi-Fi sites.

'Despite our initiative certain network hooligans don't give a damn about network access by passport.'

His account was in the control of hackers for almost an hour before a flood of fake Tweets was halted and the offending comments deleted.

The Tweets mirrored the language of a blast from minister Sergei Belyakov recently fired over his comments about the Kremlin's pension policies.

But in a series of ripostes web users highlighted the rumoured strained relations between Putin and his premier, and indulged in mockery of their leaders.

'Dmitry Medvedev's twitter was hacked by Vladimir Putin. They just pull each other's leg like that,' said Spisok Debilov.

Miroslav Zheltikov wrote: 'Actually hacking Medvedev's twitter account is a test. Everyone, who re-Tweeted will be executed in a couple of hours.'

Rtz said: 'Medvedev's twitter wasn't hacked. Dima just forgot to take his pills in the morning. Everyone in charge of it was fired already.'

Zone1508 posted: 'In the rest of the world when politicians' accounts are hacked some nonsense starts to appear - only in Russia the truth that everyone was waiting for.'

Medvedev's surname derives from the Russian word 'bear' and Anton Pokhilyak joked: 'The circus with the bear is over. That's all folks.'

Corcoran wrote: 'The Russian prime minister probably can't believe it. He's finally going viral on twitter.'

Nikolay Polozov: 'Medvedev was hacked. OK, now twitter will be forbidden for sure.'
