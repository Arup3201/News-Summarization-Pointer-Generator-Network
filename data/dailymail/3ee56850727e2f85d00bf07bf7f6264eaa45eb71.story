A family of birds has set up home in a most unusual location - a Midland hotel's cigarette bin.

The blue tits have snubbed the traditional hedges and trees for a nesting site that’s filled with discarded cigarette butts at Fairlawns Hotel, Aldridge, near Walsall in the West Midlands.

Guests enjoying a smoke at the venue have been able to enjoy a bit of birdwatching as tiny birds fly in and out of holes on the bin.

Although it seems like a bizarre nesting site, it’s secure, warm and filled with filters that act as insulation - the perfect place for a bird to make a home.

Keep the home fire burning: A family of blue tits have made their home in a cigarette bin at a hotel

Hotel staff are keenly awaiting the chicks' emergence from the bin. A sign has been placed on the metal container to warn smokers that the birds are nesting inside

The management are so enamoured with their new feathered friends, who arrived two weeks ago, they've taken the bin out of action to ensure the family is not disturbed.

A sign has been placed on the metal container to warn smokers that the birds are nesting inside and butts should not be binned.

Now hotel staff are keenly awaiting the chicks' emergence from the bin.

Hotel deputy manager Neil Wyatt said: 'The bin is only waist high, so we were very surprised the blue tits chose it for a home.

The birds' new home is located outside a conference room at the hotel

'We first noticed they were flying in and out two weeks ago. Since then, they’ve been very busy.

'They’ve been taking food inside, so we know there’s young in there. It’s just a case of waiting for them to come out - hopefully, without a nicotine addiction.'

It’s not the first time that birds have set-up home in an oversized ashtray.

Last year a pair of great tits took over a cigarette bin at a restaurant in Yoxall, Staffordshire.

Meanwhile, Severn Trent Construction workers were in a flap after a 40 tonne crawler crane was forced to stop work due to nesting birds spotted inside the machinery.

An eagle-eyed team worker noticed the new born chicks while working on recent sewage improvements in Rainsworth, Nottinghamshire, and have since been called to stand down.

Protected under the Countryside and Wildlife Act, the five baby Pied Wagtails are seen safely tucked away underneath the the crane's giant frame.

Since being spotted back in April, the chicks are now being closely monitored.
