On Thursday, the hotel was sold in a deal worth tens of millions of pounds, according to the Manchester Evening News.

The hotel is popular with a number of visiting sports clubs while United often stay ahead of home Premier League matches.

New Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was also spotted at the Lowry Hotel with his fiancee Christine Bleakley shortly after signing for the Premier League champions.
