The fire which grounded a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow Airport was not directly linked to the passenger jet's batteries, an investigation has found.

Air accident experts have been in London today to try and determine the cause of the blaze which happened while the Ethiopian Airlines-operated plane was on a remote parking stand just after 4.30pm yesterday.

The fire led to the airport's runways being closed for more than 90 minutes and causing travel chaos for thousands.

A series of problems with batter led to all Dreamliner jets in service being grounded worldwide.

Nobody was on board at the time of the Heathrow incident and there were no injuries, an airport spokesman has said.

The US National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a representative to London to assist authorities with their investigation into the fire.

Today the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch said the initial investigation was likely to take several days.

The aircraft is currently being examined in a hangar at Heathrow.

Investigators have found 'extensive heat damage in the upper portion of the rear fuselage, a complex part of the aircraft'.

The AAIB said: 'The aircraft is currently located in a hangar at London Heathrow. There has been extensive heat damage in the upper portion of the rear fuselage, a complex part of the aircraft, and the initial investigation is likely to take several days.

'However, it is clear that this heat damage is remote from the area in which the aircraft main and APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) batteries are located and at this stage there is no evidence of a direct causal relationship.'

Ethiopian Airlines said the aircraft had been parked at Heathrow for more than eight hours before smoke was detected.

An airline spokesman said they would continue to operate their fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

Meanwhile, in a separate incident Thomson Airways said a Dreamliner flight to Florida had to be diverted back to Manchester yesterday due to a 'technical issue'.

Boeing temporarily withdrew the Dreamliner from service earlier this year for modifications after concerns that batteries on board could cause fires.

A Heathrow spokesman said yesterday: 'Heathrow's runways are now fully open following an earlier fire on board an Ethiopian Airlines aircraft which the airport's emergency services attended.

Emergency: Several fire crews were called out to deal with the fire on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner at Heathrow Airport yesterday afternoon

Staff from Boeing were on the ground at Heathrow to investigate the events on Friday afternoon

'The aircraft was parked on a remote parking stand and there were no passengers on board. Arrivals and departures were temporarily suspended while airport fire crews attended to this incident. This is a standard procedure if fire crews are occupied with an incident.'

The fire appeared to have caused damage to the top of the plane's fuselage.

An Ethiopian Airlines statement said: 'Smoke was detected from Ethiopian Airlines B787 aircraft... which was parked at London Heathrow airport for more than eight hours.

'The aircraft was empty when the incident was observed. The cause of the incident is under investigation by all concerned.'

An
Air Accidents Investigation Branch spokesman said: 'We are aware of the
incident at Heathrow and have sent a team to investigate.'

A
Boeing spokesman said: 'We're aware of the event. We have Boeing 
personnel on the ground at Heathrow and are working to fully understand 
and address this.'

Boeing shares fell sharply on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday after news broke of the incident.

Thomson
Airways became the first British carrier to operate the Dreamliner 
earlier this week, and is taking delivery of eight of the planes.

The company had hoped to take delivery of the first of its 787s in time to start Dreamliner operations in May.

But a series of battery problems led to the grounding of the plane earlier this year while modifications were carried out.

Thomson had to scrap plans to use the ultra-green aircraft in May and June, and only received its first plane in June.

The
battery problems followed endless production difficulties for the 
Dreamliner, which has been marketed as a quiet, fuel-efficient aircraft 
carrying between 201 and 290 passengers on medium-range routes.

It
should have entered passenger service in 2008 but it was not until 
October 2011 that the first commercial flight was operated by Japanese 
carrier All Nippon Airways.

British
Airways is taking delivery of the first two of its 24 Dreamliners, 
while Virgin Atlantic said it 'remains committed' to taking the first of
its 16 Dreamliners in September next year.

A
Virgin Atlantic spokeswoman said: 'Virgin Atlantic is in regular 
communication with Boeing to understand all the technical issues around 
the aircraft and the airline remains committed to taking delivery of 16 
Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners from autumn 2014.

'We
are confident that Boeing and the relevant authorities are working hard
to ensure that the appropriate action is being taken.'

Three
flights bound for Heathrow from Lagos, Shanghai and Delhi were diverted
to London Gatwick due to the disruption, Virgin Atlantic said.

There were 44 flights cancelled at Heathrow Airport today as a result of yesterday's disruption when runways were closed to all flights for an hour-and-a-half as emergency crews dealt with the blaze.

Thomson
Airways said its Dreamliner flight to Florida was flown back to 
Manchester airport yesterday afternoon as a 'precautionary measure'.

A
spokesman said: 'Thomson Airways can confirm that flight TOM126 
travelling from Manchester to Sanford, Florida, experienced a technical 
issue and the aircraft returned to Manchester Airport, as a 
precautionary measure.

'Passengers have disembarked and our dedicated team of engineers are now inspecting the aircraft.

'Our customers will be moved to an alternative aircraft to ensure they get away on their holiday as soon as possible.

'The safety of our customers and crew is of paramount importance and we would like to apologise for the delay caused.'
