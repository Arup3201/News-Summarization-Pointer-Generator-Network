Everyone has them: the embarrassing old photographs that we would rather remained unseen.

But when you become President and First Lady of America, it’s impossible to keep those pictures hidden away for ever, as these newly released images prove.

They are taken from school yearbooks at the height of the disco era – and it shows.

Cool: Newly released images of the future President and First Lady taken from school yearbooks have been released. Barack Obama is pictured at Punahou School, Honolulu in 1979

Sporty: The future President was the tallest - and only black - member of the exclusive Punahou School's 'junior varsity' basketball team in 1977

In the most striking, a young Barack Obama – or Barry, as he styled himself in those days – is dressed in a white jacket and wide-collared shirt that is clearly inspired by John Travolta’s distinctive Saturday Night Fever outfit.

He was educated in Hawaii at one of Honolulu’s most expensive schools, the Punahou Academy, where he was the only black pupil – and changed his name in an effort to assimilate.

One picture shows him at age 11 taking part in a comedy skit, while another shows the 15-year-old Obama standing head and shoulders above the rest of his basketball team-mates.

‘It was a really fun, happy time,’ recalled Kelli Allman, a fellow pupil.

Meanwhile, 4,200 miles away, Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was growing up in comparative poverty on Chicago’s tough South Side, where she attended the predominantly black Whitney Young High School.

A smart pupil, she went on to Princeton and then to the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack .  .  . and last year they celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary.
