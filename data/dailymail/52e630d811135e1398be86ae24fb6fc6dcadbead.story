A dancer was knocked unconscious when she smashed her head on the ground following a failed dance routine live on Peruvian television.

Delly Madrid, who is also a model, was performing on the dancing programme when she attempted to balance on a bamboo pole being held by two other dancers. 

But as the 32-year-old balanced on the prop it collapsed and she crashed face-first to the floor.

it. There's no more dancing. What we want is to go out to be next to 
Delly.'
