This is the moment a motorcyclist was hit by a car, flipped over in the air and then miraculously landed back on his feet.

Taylor Smith caught the drama on a helmet-mounted camera as he tried to get across an intersection in San Francisco, but was hit by a car which ran a red light.

The impact flipped him and his bike over the hood, but somehow he span through the air and then landed back on his feet.

This is the moment a motorcyclist was hit by a car, flipped over in the air and then miraculously landed back on his feet

He managed to move to the sidewalk in a daze as bystanders rushed to help him.

'He was slamming on his brakes, so it launched me forward; somehow I landed on my feet.' Mr Smith told KPIX 5.

'Actually pretty happy because that probably reduced any further damage that could have happened to my body.'

Mr Smith, who had just left a garage on his way home from work, only suffered a minor sprain, although his Triumph Daytona motorcycle was written off.

Mr Smith is seen here landing back on his feet to face the car. He managed to move to the sidewalk in a daze as bystanders rushed to help him

He posted the video on Reddit with the title:  'The death of my D675 and birth of my Ninja skills.' 

He wrote immediately after the accident: 'Just stiffness, bruising, and the occasional sharp pain.'

'Doesn't feel like anything is broken or torn but I'll leave that up to the experts to decide. 

'I wouldn't be surprised if I walked away from this with a couple of bruises and that's it though.

He also posted a message to pedestrians to check a crossing even if they have a walk signal.

'A couple of people began crossing the street and would have been taken out if I wasn't in the way of this driver,' he wrote.

'Let's call it taking one for the team.'

'Actually pretty happy because that probably reduced any further damage that could have happened to my body,' said Mr Smith (pictured)
