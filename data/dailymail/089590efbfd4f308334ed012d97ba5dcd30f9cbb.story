There's been a significant breakthrough in a suspected double murder, with a handbag, driver's license and other personal items being found close to the discovery of human remains on a Queensland property.

Police launched an investigation following the disappearance of Chantal Barnett, 27, and Robert Martinez, 26 in March last year around the Rockhampton and Yeppoon areas, north of Brisbane.

Human bones, believed to be male, were found at a property on Bowlin road in Rockhampton on Wednesday, which was previously searched as part of the investigation.

The driver's license of Chantal Barnett (pictured) was also found along with a handbag and medicare card and personal documents by police. They were all found close to human remains discovered by farmer on Wednesday on a Rockhampton property

Police say significant items of interest, including a handbag, identification, medicare card and personal documents belonging to Chantal Barnett, were located by a farmer at the same search site two weeks prior.

'This has been a continuous and very arduous investigation for 18 months now, finding these items is no accident,' said Senior Sergeant Chris Knight.

'Both families have been briefed and kept up to date with these developments,' he said. 

A search of the property will be ongoing but police have not indicated a time frame saying the search will keep to a focused area.

Forensic examinations will be done on anything else police may find at the property. 

The discovery has prompted a reward for information.

The Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services has approved a $250,000 reward, following an extensive investigation, leading to the conviction of any person responsible for the murders of the Queensland pair.

Additionally, an indemnity from prosecution will be recommended for any accomplice, not being the person who actually committed the crime, who first provides information leading to a conviction.

Assistant Commissioner Mike Condon said investigators were committed to solving the case and were hoping the reward would encourage members of the public with valuable information to come forward.

In September last year police searched an area in Byfield after they discovered two articles of women's clothing, including a women's top and bra

'There are those people out there that may not be directly involved in the actual crime itself but may hold key information needed for the police to solve this case,' said Assistant Commissioner Condon.

'This announcement means if you are the first to come forward and were not involved in the actual offence, we would be in a position to recommend to the Director of Public Prosecutions an indemnity.'

'There may be those who have assisted in keeping the crime a secret and have been loyal to those involved but may not want to spend time in prison and this is their chance to come forward.'

Police are also continuing to appeal for a person who has previously provided information about the occupants of a white VT Holden commodore owned by Robert Martinez and being driven at the time of his death to come forward and provide further information to investigators. 

'The condition of the car is a focal point in the investigation,' he said. 

'I'll encourage the person who has contacted us and provided us information in relation to the occupants of Robert Martinez's VT commodore sedan, which at the time had a Queensland registration plate 830 RNG to contact us again.'
