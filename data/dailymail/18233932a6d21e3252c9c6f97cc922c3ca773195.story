The mother of a two-year-old boy has been left shaken after a Walmart customer knocked a pink headband off the head of her son and called him a f****t.Â 

Katie Vyktoriah claims that her son was verbally and physically abused after she stopped off at the Florida store with her two children on Thursday night.

Her oldest child Dexter, who loves to dress up - from superhero costumes to sparkly outfits - was wearing his mother's lace flower headband which he had been playing with earlier in the day.

Ms Vyktoriah was at the check out when a large man with a beard, and wearing tattered shorts and a camouflage shirt, yelled out: 'That's a boy?', according to the Huffington Post.

He then grabbed the headband and threw it to the bottom of the shopping cart before cuffing Dexter lightly around the side of his head and saying with a laugh: 'You'll thank me later, little man!'

In her shock and anger that a stranger had touched her child, Ms Vyktoriah told the man: 'If you touch my son again, I will cut your damn hands off.'

The 31-year-old claimed the man then looked at her child in disgust and said: 'Your son is a f****** f****t. He'll get shot for it one day.'

After the man left, the mother-of-two said no staff or customers came to her assistance as she started to shake while comforting Dexter.

Before the incident, her son had been confidently waving at customers from the seat in his trolley, 'charming all the old ladies by waving like a little pageant prince'.

In her blog, A Mother Thing, Mrs Vyktoriah said two older women had even come up to tell her how adorable her son was.

She said that while the 'cuff' the man gave her son was light, she objected to a stranger touching her child, and trying to impose his views on Dexter and making assumptions.

Ms Vyktoriah added that at two-years-old her son does not have a sexuality. He was just a boy who had been playing.

She added: 'Even if being gay is a lifestyle choice 
(which I don't believe for a second), it is not a choice that a toddler 
can ever make. And much like little girls can play baseball or enjoy 
monster trucks, little boys can and do play dress up with mommy's 
clothes ... Everything is new and exciting to a 
kid, and they learn by trying new things.'

Future fears: The couple say the incident has made them nervous about the world their children are living in

Since writing about the incident on her blog, the mother-of-two has been inundated with comments - some supportive, others criticizing her parenting skills.

Despite many people suggesting that she makes an official complaint, and advising her to check if the incident was caught on the store's surveillance cameras, Ms Vyktoriah has decided not to pursue the matter.

She said the experience has made her reflect on the world in which her children are growing up, adding: 'While we may accept and support whoever 
our kids turn out to be, I am scared beyond words at what it would mean 
for them if they are gay. Why should anyone have to live in fear because
they fall in love with someone that you or someone else doesn't agree 
with.'
