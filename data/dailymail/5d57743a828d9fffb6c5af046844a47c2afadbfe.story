Police have found video of an unconscious girl being gang raped on a Florida beach in broad daylight during Spring Break.

Hundreds of people are seen watching without attempting to intervene during the alleged attack on Panama City Beach, authorities claim.

The footage was uncovered on a cell phone during an unconnected investigation into a shooting in Troy, Alabama.

Alerting the Bay County Sheriff's Office, the two departments worked together to identify two suspects and the alleged victim.

Troy University students Delone' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, have been suspended from college while they are detained for questioning, WSFA reports. 

Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen branded the video the 'most disgusting, sickening thing'.

According to McKeithen, one man is heard in the clip saying, 'she isn't going to know,' before putting his hand inside her bikini bottoms.

He told a press conference: 'This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped.

Horrific: Authorities say hundreds of people walked past but did not stop the attack near Spinnaker Beach Club on Panama City Beach, Florida, in broad daylight during a Spring Break party last month

'This is such a traumatizing event for this girl. No one should have to fear this would happen in Panama City Beach, but it does.'

According to the Panama City News Herald, the woman believes she was drugged before the attack.

She told deputies during an interview that she was afraid to report the incident because she couldn't remember many details.
