A Seattle man was arrested Saturday after he stole a large ferry boat and took it for a joyride prompting police to call in the bomb squad – just in case.

The vessel, a Victoria Clipper IV, can hold up to 330 passengers and travels between the U.S. and Canada.

The U.S. Coast Guard, Seattle Police and SWAT surrounded the vessel, which was initially thought to be adrift on its own, in the waters near the city after police received a call early Sunday about a suspicious person stealing the vessel.

A bomb squad was also called to the scene, according to a Seattle Police Department tweet.

‘We’ve got one of the best SWAT teams on the West Coast,’ Seattle PD spokesman Sean Whitcomb told NBC affiliate KING5.

‘So when we have a call that's pretty unique like this, a major passenger boat that’s somehow adrift in the water, we want to make sure that we bring in all the resources that we have available to us to ensure that the incident comes to a quick and peaceful resolution.’

It is not known how the man was able to commandeer a ship of such considerable size, which is 132 feet long.

The suspect will be booked into the King County Jail for yet-to-be-determined charges, which could include piracy or grand theft vessel, according to police.
