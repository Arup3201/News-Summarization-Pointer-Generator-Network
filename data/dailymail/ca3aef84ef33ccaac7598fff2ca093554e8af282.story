An elderly man was filmed riding his mobility scooter down a street – even though it was flooded and had turned into a river.

While cars lay abandoned in the road, the unnamed pensioner ploughed on regardless, much to the hilarity of the bystanders filming him.

The incredible video was shot in Arnhem, Netherlands, when it was blighted with flooding after the river Rhine burst its banks.

The low-lying Netherlands has been fighting back water for more than a thousand years when farmers first built dikes to protect their land.

Now a complicated network of canals and pumping stations cover the country keeping it high and dry.

But as this video shows, a bit of flooding is nothing the Dutch can’t handle.

The news comes as a British pensioner caused chaos on the M1 motorway by riding his scooter the wrong way down the hard shoulder.

The 85-year-old escaped unharmed after being escorted home by the police.
