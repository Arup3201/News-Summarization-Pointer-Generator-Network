James Isted, 27, will serve a minimum of nine years for twice attacking lone women in the graveyard of All Saints Church, Orpington. One was pregnant and lost her child in the attack

A rapist released after a police error was sentenced to life today for striking again in a terrifying identical repeat attack on a pregnant woman who then lost her unborn child.

James Isted, 27, will serve a minimum of nine years for twice attacking lone women in the graveyard of All Saints Church, Orpington, after following his victims, aged seventeen and twenty-seven.

Isted was arrested the first time for raping a teenager, who he struck over the head before beating - but was not charged.

The man, described by the probation service as 'A highly dangerous individual 
capable of causing significant harm,  threatened his second victim with a knife and raped her in the same location twenty months later.

Married father-of-two Isted, from Orpington was convicted at Croydon Crown Court of two 
counts of rape and robbery against the women on September 30, 2011 and 
May 7 2013.

The construction worker was also convicted of assault by penetration in relation to the second victim and assaulting PC Steve Patterson, with intent to resist arrest. The officer was left with a nasty cut to his hand.

Recorder of Croydon Warwick McKinnon sentencing told Isted: 'Very clearly you are a very dangerous 
man.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 
'The MPS acknowledges that in this case we made mistakes and we have 
apologised to the victim of the second offence.

'Had certain actions been taken earlier, a second offence may have been prevented.'

The Met refused to say what mistakes had been made because an internal inquiry is taking place.

Both attacks occurred in the churchyard - the first at 2.40am when the lone teen was struck and dragged into the deserted graveyard.

She was subjected to a harrowing and lengthy ordeal and Isted left with her handbag, which contained a mobile phone and other personal items.

'She was jumped on from behind and struck,' said prosecutor Mr. Jonathan Polnay. 'She says her life has been destroyed by this.'

The court heard the teen immediately moved out of the area and plans to emigrate to the United States as a result of being raped.

Isted was sentenced at Croydon Crown Court, pictured. Recorder of Croydon Warwick McKinnon told him today: 'Very clearly you are a very dangerous man.'

'She was walking home in the dead of night, a vulnerable victim,' added Mr Polnay. 'It is also an aggravating feature that the rapes took place in a graveyard, heightening the fear and the ordeal.'

The prosecutor submitted the location of the rapes was 'grossly offensive' and insulting to the families of the deceased.

He was arrested a few days later on October 4, but was bailed pending further inquiries.

Almost two years later, after being told by police there would be no further action, the man raped his second victim at 1.30pm at the same place.

A probation officer, who interviewed Isted after he was convicted, wrote: 'Emboldened by the fact the police did not charge him for the first offence he carried out the second offence, believing he would not be detected'

It was in the graveyard of All Saint's Church in Orpington (pictured) where Isted attacked his victims

He threatened his victim  - who was pregnant at the time - with a Stanley knife

'He knew she was pregnant at the time, but continued to rape her,' explained Mr. Polnay. 'She told him she was pregnant.

'A Stanley knife was used and not only did she see it, he used it to cut parts of her clothing and threatened to cut her hair, being paranoid about DNA.'

This time a witness reported the  daylight attack and Isted was arrested after a short police chase in possession of the victim’s bank card and jewellery, including her engagement ring and another ring.
