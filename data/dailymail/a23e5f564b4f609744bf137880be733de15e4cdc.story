It is one of the more unlikely summer trends of 2013, but thanks to one high fashion label’s love for children’s building blocks, plastic is back.

Chanel’s £5,000 ‘Lego’ clutch bag has been seen slung over the shoulders of celebrities such as Rita Ora, Rihanna and the Kardashian clan.

The tiny Plexiglass bag bears a striking similarity to the Danish children’s toy bricks, but its price is far from an actual Lego box.

Measuring only 12cm x 20cm x 5.5cm, the £5,370 price tag appears only to have aided the Chanel clutch's reputation as the ‘it’ bag of Summer 2013.

Plastic has become ‘fabtastic’, and is no longer associated with jelly-sandals and the 1980s, but with innovation and high fashion.

Gucci’s £770 Aristographic Perspex clutch sold out on Net-A-Porter, a crystal embellished PVC clutch by Shourock retails at £520.

Designer Charlotte Olympia’s Perspex clutches comes in novelty shapes such as watermelons and movie clappers, and her Box Office Pandora bag in see-thorough and gold plastic will set fashionistas back £1,595.

The waiting list for the Lego clutch? There is none. It was only made as a limited edition product and has sold out.

‘The unique design and innovative construction of these clutches has made them feel more like works of art than bags,’ Justin O’Shea, buying director at mytheresa.com told The Times.

‘They have become real collector’s items.’

At the Danish toy company, the original inspiration for the Chanel clutch is 'unmistakable' and 'flattering'.

'This new clutch design featuring the bright colours and Lego block shape is flattery in its sincerest form,' Emma Owen, PR manager at Lego told the Times.

'We are trilled to see that our brand, that is typically synonymous with children, is now inspiring innovative catwalk designs.'

For budgetarians and those unable to get their hands on the prized Chanel Lego clutch, the high street is not far behind and on-trend plastic bags can be found for under £20 in Accessorize, Zara and New Look.
