Drug dealers operating a pizza delivery style heroin and crack cocaine network have been jailed for almost 100 years.

The 33 dealers were operating in Birmingham when they were arrested following a major operation by West Midlands Police in February. 

Officers arranged a series of dawn raids across the north of the city and broke up the major drugs network.

West Midlands police released a rogues' gallery of the drug dealers who appeared in court during the week

More than 100 officers conducted a series of dawn raids over four days, arresting dozens of suspects. They recovered class A and Class B drugs worth more than £20,000 along with almost £35,000 in cash and a firearm.

A total of 33 drug dealers appeared in Birmingham Crown Court during the week where they were received jail terms ranging from nine years and six months down to a suspended sentence. 

The operation targeted street-level dealers as well as those further up the criminal hierarchy. 

The court heard that crack cocaine and heroin was delivered door-to-door 'like a pizza delivery service'. 

Police gathered intelligence on the gang by monitoring phone numbers associated with the suspects.   

At Birmingham Crown Court last week 28 men and one woman were jailed for a total of 98 years and four men handed suspended sentences for supplying drugs.

Following the successful confictions, the force released a rogues gallery of all 33 defendants who were said to have made their drug deliveries like a takeaway delivery service.

Inspector Steve Rees, from Birmingham North Police, who led the operation, said: 'We had a fantastic response from the people of Birmingham following No Deal.

'This included increased community intelligence coming through to us and even firearms being handed in.

'We will continue to work with our partners to try to eradicate drugs from the city's streets and help those individuals who wish to break their drug addiction.

'We are very aware that by taking action against a number of individuals, this opens the door to the next wave of dealers.
