A woman who was put up for adoption as a baby has met two sisters she never knew she had thanks to a Facebook appeal.

Nicholle Oliver, who lives in Pittsburgh, had posted an image to Facebook showing her holding up a sign asking for help tracking down her mother, who she believed would be 64.

While Oliver sadly discovered that her mother, Jodi Hildreth, had passed away, she did gain two sisters she didn't know she had - Rosie Briggs Franklin and Dollie Conant - after the photo went viral.

A week after she first posted the message, Oliver and Franklin organized to meet in Columbus, Ohio - and WCPO filmed the moment Franklin arrived early and crept up on her unsuspecting sister.

Plea: Nicholle Oliver, 36, shared this image to her Facebook page earlier this month asking for help tracking down her mother, who had given her up for adoption when she was born in 1977

The women were seen screaming and then hugging tightly as their children looked on.

'It's
 unbelievable,' Oliver said. 'I
 have this huge hole filled that I never thought would be filled. It's 
crazy.'

'Amazing, amazing,' said Franklin, who had always been told her sister had been given up for adoption after suffering health problems because of their mother's drug addiction.

'I'm just so happy that she's alive and that 
she's OK and she's beautiful and is living a good full life. And 
perfectly normal, perfectly normal, practically perfect in every way.'

The meeting came a week after Oliver, herself a mother to a daughter, posted an image on Facebook on March 7 asking for help tracking down her parents.

Sisters: Oliver, right, wore a t-shirt to celebrate just learning that her grandfather had been Irish

Together: The women embrace after meeting - little over a week since Oliver posted her picture

'I was born on November 18, 1977 in 
Washington, Penn.,' it read. 'I was put up for adoption through catholic charities. I
 am looking for my birth parents from Columbus, Ohio. My birth mother's 
name is Jodi Hildreth. She would be 64-years-old. Please share on 
Facebook.'

The photo was shared nearly 5,000 on Facebook and after help from some internet sleuths, she learned that her mother had passed away, that her grandfather had arrived in the U.S. from Ireland and that she had two sisters.

'Holy [expletive] I found my sisters Rosie Briggs Franklin and Dollie Conant,' she wrote on March 11.

The story soon spread far enough to reach the women.

'Here was my sister that I had no idea she was even 
alive, holding a picture with my mom's name and "I am 
looking for my family",' Franklin said. 'I was just shocked. I just sat 
there for a minute and looked at it like, "is this for real?"'

Found: After their meeting, Oliver, right, and Franklin, left, drove to see their other sister, Dollie Conant, center. The women said they didn't know their sister's real name or if she was even alive

Happy: The women live in different states but said they have the rest of their lives to make up for lost time

Franklin
 and Conant, who had grown up together, knew their mother had given birth to 
another girl, but they knew her as 'Jenni' and thought she had died or suffered serious problems because of their mother's addiction.

Franklin said that she would never have known the truth had it not been for Oliver's plea because they had the wrong name.

After the emotional meeting between Franklin and Oliver, they drove to Lima to see Conant. The women shared photos of the three of them together on their Facebook profiles.

Oliver, whose adoptive parents have both passed away, was sad to leave her newly-found sisters, but added: 'We have our whole lives now, which is awesome.'
