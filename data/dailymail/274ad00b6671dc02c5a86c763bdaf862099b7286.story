Owners of a mischievous dog were baffled as to how their pet was able to escape the house when all the windows were locked so they set up a camera to document his tricky break. What they found is quite a treat.

Ever since user Rumble Viral posted the video of the dog unlocking a window and escaping on YouTube on September 22, the clip has gone viral with over 142,126 views.

Footage of the dog's masterful maneuver begins with him looking around to check if the coast is clear. 

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Coast is clear: This sneaky dog wants to make sure no one is around to document his sneaky escape from his owner's house so he takes a good look at his surroundings 

Snout working: At first the dog tries to push the window handle up with his snout but he can't seem to get it to turn so he decided to try a different way of opening it next time

Pawctice makes perfect: Next the dog tries to paw at the handle to open it but unfortunately his furry little paw isn't strong enough to rotate the handle all the way open 

Once the humans are no where to be seen he begins attempting to turn the handle on the door.

First he tries his paw at at opening the door with his adorable snout.

When that doesn't work he takes his paw and attempts to push the handle on the window.

The dog looks longingly out the window at the outside world perhaps dreaming of the squirrels he can chase or the little scraps of food dropped by passersby he can eat as the warm sun shines down on his fur.

After peering out the window at the majestic world outside, he develops the stamina needed to open the locked window.

Brilliantly using his snout to turn the handle and then to push open the window he take one more glance to make sure that the coast is clear and goes on his merry way.

Seeking sunspiration: The dog looks longingly out the window at all of the fun things he's missing while locked inside his house with no trees or squirrels to chase 

Has a handle on things: Finally the dog is able to position his snout in the right place to break open the window and frolic around the outside world 

Free doggy: The dog is finally free to roam around in the greenery after successfully opening a locked window
