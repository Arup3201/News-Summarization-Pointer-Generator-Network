Probe: Employment minister Jo Swinson says 466 companies have been handed penalties so far this year to combat unpaid interns

Hundreds of companies are being investigated by tax officials for potentially breaking the law by using unpaid interns to fill jobs.

The firms - believed to include some household names - could be fined, ‘named and shamed’ and even prosecuted if they are failing to pay workers the national minimum wage.

The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills announced a new crackdown amid fears that interns are being exploited and made to work for free in effectively full-time, paid occupations.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which enforces the national minimum wage on behalf of BIS, is writing to 200 employers which recently advertised unpaid internships.

The employers are to be warned about a series of imminent ‘targeted checks’ to make sure interns are being paid the correct national minimum wage. This is £6.31 an hour for people aged over 21.

Michelle Wyer, HMRC’s assistant director of National Minimum Wage, said: ‘Any employer not playing by the National Minimum Wage rules needs to put things right now.

‘Those that don’t can expect a visit from HMRC - which could result in a penalty, payment of arrears, being publicly named and shamed by BIS or a prosecution.’

The action comes after Intern Aware, which campaigns against abuses of the internship process, passed the government a list of more than 100 companies which were advertising unpaid work in April.

HMRC has also collated details of firms that could be flouting the law.

It has already targeted London Fashion Week as the fashion industry takes on a high number of interns. Its enforcement action recently identified two employers not complying with National Minimum Wage law.

While companies are free to offer work experience, where this amounts to a job - for example if the position lasts for a long time and hours and duties are set - companies are breaking employment law if they do not pay at least the minimum wage.

Employment Relations Minister Jo Swinson will also unveil new guidance for interns today produced by BIS and 4Talent, Channel 4’s in-house scheme, offering internships in the creative industries.

A video and posters will explain to young people what their rights are and how to take action if they feel exploited by companies.

Miss Swinson said: ‘Not paying the National Minimum Wage is illegal and if an employer breaks the law, government will take tough action.

‘Already, this year HMRC has issued penalties to 466 employers. Anyone considered a worker under the law should be paid at least the minimum wage, whether they are an intern, or someone on work experience.

She added: ‘We will continue to work closely with HMRC to clampdown on rogue employers. The targeted letters being sent to employers advertising internships today is just one example of this work.

‘By raising awareness of National Minimum Wage rates and the law we will make sure people play by the rules and treat their workers fairly.’

People are turning up at internships and
being treated as a full employee in every way, except at the end of the
month they don’t get a pay cheque through while everyone else does

Gus Baker, co-director of Intern Aware

Intern Aware said it had been prevented by HMRC from disclosing the list of employers it had submitted earlier this year, which included examples from marketing, PR and graphics.

However, a quick search on the internet shows that firms are still advertising high-flying, long-term unpaid internships.

Fortnum & Mason in Knightsbridge, West London, is currently offering a beauty buying internship for up to four months, with just ‘expenses’ covered.

The post involves ‘working closely with the buying teams to carry out essential administrative tasks in a fast paced luxury retail environment’.

Tasks will include ‘article creation and maintenance; assisting with presentations by collating samples and mood boards; communication with internal departments; researching latest buying trends and pricing; keeping up to date with competitors; maintaining good relationships with suppliers’.

Gus Baker, co-director of Intern Aware, said yesterday: ‘We are delighted to see that action is being taken. Having said that, the proof of the pudding is in the eating and we will be expecting that enforcement action generates results as regards penalties due to non-payment of minimum wage.

‘Writing letters to companies and then failing to follow them up won’t do. It’s important that all interns are paid and that means HMRC making sure they fully enforce the law.’

He added: ‘People are turning up at internships and being treated as a full employee in every way, except at the end of the month they don’t get a pay cheque through while everyone else does.

‘They’re told to stay late, work on projects and to deliver stuff for clients. We’ve heard stories of people being billed out at nearly hundreds of pounds an hour while not being paid themselves.’
