'Rant': Justine Greening lost her role as Transport Secretary in David Cameron's reshuffle of his cabinet

Sacked Transport Secretary Justine Greening shouted at David Cameron, ‘I didn’t come into politics to distribute money to people in the Third World!’ when he put her in charge of overseas aid, it was claimed last night.

And she warned him the move would make a mockery of his promise at the last Election not to build a third runway at Heathrow.

The feisty Minister told the PM: ‘If you remove me from transport it will be obvious to everyone  that you are changing your policy on the third runway.’

Details of the angry exchange between high-flying Ms Greening and Mr Cameron emerged days after her surprise removal as Transport Secretary, less than  a year after she was promoted  to the Cabinet.

Officials vehemently denied reports circulating among MPs that Ms Greening used much  more colourful language during  the acrimonious exchange  in Downing Street.

According to one account, she told Mr Cameron: ‘I did not bloody well come into politics to distribute money to people in poor countries!’ Officials said that this was completely untrue.

'Fury': Prime Minister David Cameron reshuffled his cabinet last week

Mr Cameron’s decision to force Ms Greening to move to the Department for International Development could undermine his controversial pledge to increase the overseas aid budget to a record £11.5 billion by 2014 – at the same time as squeezing spending on schools and hospitals in the UK.

Former accountant Ms Greening is seen as being far less committed to his policy of using aid to boost Britain’s reputation abroad than her predecessor Andrew Mitchell.

A Tory ally of Ms Greening said: ‘Justine has never really been interested in overseas aid. But you can be sure she will go through every project to make sure not  a single penny of the billions of pounds we dole out to the Third World is wasted.’

Ms Greening’s fury at being ousted from transport stemmed partly from her anti-third runway stance on behalf of her constituents in Putney, South-West London, which is under the Heathrow flightpath.
