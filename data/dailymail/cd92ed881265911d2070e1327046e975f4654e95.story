A seven-year-old boy has claimed that a real-life Skippy The Bush Kangaroo saved him when he went missing in the Australian bush last weekend.

Simon Kruger became lost when he followed a wallaby into trees at the vast Deep Creek Conservation Park near Adelaide, South Australia, as his family ate lunch nearby.

But despite not being dressed for a night in the wilderness, Simon survived almost 24 hours in the bush thanks to the help of a friendly kangaroo who approached him as he picked flowers for his mother and fell asleep next to him to keep him warm.

Natives: There are thought to be around 58 million kangaroos living in Australia

Simon's father Etienne Kruger told Seven Network: 'The kangaroo came closer to him and ate the flowers from him and then the kangaroo fell asleep next to him.

'I think god sent a kangaroo to keep him warm.'

A search party, including two helicopters, attempted to find Simon throughout the night with rescuers using parachute flares in a bid to find him.

But he was eventually spotted by one of the helicopters around 500 metres from where he had originally gone missing and was winched to safety.

The youngster suffered just minor injuries from his ordeal and was reunited with his relieved family.

His mother, Linda, said: 'I think it was a miracle, when I smell his jacket, it's kangaroo - bush and kangaroo.'Â

Things could have been far worse for Simon, with temperatures at the park dipping to just 6C during the night.

It was lucky for rescuers that he remained so close to where he went missing too, the park is 45 square kilometres of thick bushland.

Simon's father Etienne told the Daily Telegraph in Australia that his son is recovering well from the ordeal.

Australia is home to an estimated 58 million kangaroos.

His encounter with the marsupial is reminiscent of the popular 1960s programme Skippy The Bush Kangaroo.

Hero: The boy's encounter with the marsupial is reminiscent of the popular 1960s television programme Skippy The Bush Kangaroo, which featured a kangaroo as the hero

Ninety-one shows were made there over three seasons between 1966 and 1968 filmed just outside Sydney.

They were broadcast in Britain, Mexico and the US, and countless other countries in the following years.

Despite debuting on black-and-white televisions, the show was filmed in colour which gave it an added longevity, becoming even more popular in repeats.
