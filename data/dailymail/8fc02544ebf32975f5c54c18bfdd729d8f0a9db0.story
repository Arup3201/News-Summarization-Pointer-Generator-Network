A 28-year-old man has lost 281lbs after completely overhauling his life.

Jarvez, a former college football player from Portland, Oregon, went from 548lbs to 267lbs after ditching fast food for healthier alternatives and adopting an extremely intense exercise regime.

As a star of Extreme Makeover: Weight Loss Edition, he was motivated to lose the incredible amount of weight after splitting his work pants one day and realizing that no store stocked a replacement in his size.

Transformation: Jarvez was motivated after splitting his work pants and failing to find a replacement that fit him

Jarvez, who began 'getting big' during middle school, was more than 360lbs overweight when he approached the weight loss show.

When he split his pants, he was forced 
to take three days off work in order to wait for a custom-made pair to 
be sent to him after he placed an order for it online.

'When I couldn't buy a pair of pants, everything became real,' he said. 'Every day I say I'm sexy, every day my family tells me I'm crazy. So it 
took a while for me to look in the mirror and say "Wow, you have a 
problem".'

He stuck to a diet of 2000 calories per 
day which was low in sugar and sodium. he also weight trained three days
per week and cardio-trained for two-four hours six times per week.

New man: The former football player stuck to a diet that replaced fast food and soda with healthier options

Dedicated: Given Jarvez's football background, he takes to his new exercise regime extremely well

He had been aiming to lose ten lbs per week.

In the beginning, he is seen struggling to get out of his car as his sheer size did not fit comfortably through the door.

He
said prior to his weight loss journey: 'The thing is, people encouraged
me to get big, "Oh, you're big, that means you're more [of] a man. I 
was excited to be big.'

Jarvez, who was married to his wife Adriana just two weeks prior to the beginning of his weight loss journey, was also seen struggling to place a XXX-large football jersey over his chest.

He said that his wife's concerns over his weight helped to inspire him also.

Support: His wife Adriana (left) says that her husband's heart may 'stop beating' unless he becomes fit

'I don't want to be where my wife has to bury me because I ate too much,' he said.

She tells her husband: 'I worry that some day, your heart's going to stop.'

Jarvez sticks to the exercise regime, and even his new diet, even going so far as to organize a Thanksgiving workout session before he feasted on a couple of naughty treats.

He lost so much weight that he checks in for skin removal surgery where he passed out when he discovered how much excess skin had been removed.

'Before, I couldn't get off the couch, now, I'm upset when I have to sit on the couch,' he said.

In order to maintain his enviable new physique, he has started taking the bus to work in order to avoid the fast food options that would once lure him over before and after his working day.
