Floyd Mayweather may be the world's greatest boxer, but when it comes to singing he's scary for different reasons.

The 37-year-old took his girlfriend, Doralie Medina, out for her birthday and 'treated' guests to an example of his singing, which did not live up to his fighting ability.

A five-division world champion, Mayweather is famous for being as wealthy as he is talented, and the boxer treated his Medina to a collection of presents for her 30th birthday.

Mayweather's last fight was against Marcos Maidana back in May this year. British boxer Amir Khan had expressed an interest in fighting the American but he chose Maidana instead. Mayweather won the fight by majority decision.

A rematch has already been scheduled between the two. The fight will take place on September 13 at the MGM Grand.

Mayweather has won all 46 of his professional fights, and knocked out 26 opponents in the process.
