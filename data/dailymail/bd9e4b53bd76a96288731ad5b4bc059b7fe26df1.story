Bournemouth's young players will need to ensure they don't get too carried away when the senior side take on Liverpool in their Capital One Cup quarter-final.

The Championship club have enforced a set of strict rules for their stars of the future, one of which is a £20 fine for inappropriate posts on social media sites.

The youth team will be in attendance at the Goldsands Stadium on Wednesday night but, with controversial refereeing decisions often the cause of angry tweets, they'd be wise to leave their mobile phones at home.

QPR defender Rio Ferdinand was banned for three matches and fined £25,000 by the FA earlier this season after replying to someone on Twitter using the word 'sket' - slang for a promiscuous female.

And while the Cherries youth team can expect to get away with a lighter punishment, their fine will be doubled if they fail to pay up within seven days.

Ahead of the Championship side's clash with Liverpool, Sportsmail's Neil Ashton snapped a laminated poster at the club's ground which details all of the reasons youth players can be fined.

As well as stupidity on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, Bournemouth's youngsters are forced to pay £10 if they have their mobile phone switched on in a dressing room or classroom.

Missing more than 10 minutes of a first-team match also carries a £10 fine, while any breach of curfew will cost them £20.

Other offences include being sent off, booked for dissent and wearing inappropriate clothing.

Arsenal's fine system was revealed by Sportsmail in January last year, with defender Per Mertesacker acting as Arsene Wenger's debt collector.

Fines include £1,000 for unused players who do not turn up at home matches without permission, £500 for being more than 15 minutes late for training and £100 for taking newspapers into the dressing room.

When asked why Mertesacker was in charge, Wenger said: 'The Germans do well economically and we respect that. They are the only ones that make money in Europe. That’s why we’ve chosen a German.'
