Google already dominates web search, maps, email, online video and even high-speed internet.

But the tech giant's virtual empire could be about to take physical form - as the firm is set to bid for the rights to take over an airport.

Nasa is looking for a buyer to renovate a disused hangar at an airfield near Google's headquarters, and the company's bosses are believed to be in the frame.

Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt, the co-founders and chairman of Google, are believed to have access to a fleet of eight private jets between them.

The trio offered 16 months ago to pay $33million for the renovation of Hangar One at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California, where the firm is based.

Their offer was rejected, but last week the federal government announced that it was now actively seeking bids to take over the iconic 80-year-old structure.

Google executives have long rented space at Moffett Field to park their private aeroplanes, but the prospect of their own dedicated structure could be too much to resist.

Lenny Siegel, from the Save Hangar One Committee, included Mr Page and Mr Brin on a list of possible buyers based on their pre-existing links to the site.

'They understand the historic importance of the building,' he told the Mercury News.

Moffett Field is currently attached to the Ames Research Center, a major Nasa laboratory opened in 1939.

Last Friday federal officials announced that they were seeking a private partner to help save Hangar One from destruction after it was found to be leaking toxic chemicals.

In its heyday, the hangar was one of the most prominent landmarks in Silicon Valley, covering eight acres with a maximum height of nearly 200ft (60m).

Moffett Field is not the only location which could be taken over by Google to build an airport.

The firm is likely to be the main tenant at a new $82million facility at the Mineta San Jose International Airport.

That airport would be capable of accommodating even the largest Boeing jets owned by Google and its executives.

Mr Schmidt said earlier this month that the project 'will provide us with long term hangar stability and the ability to grow our flight department in Silicon Valley'.
