Justin Bieber wants Selena Gomez back and believes their split is just a temporary 'blip.'

And Gomez flew to New York on Saturday with 'tentative plans' to meet her estranged beau ahead of his Brooklyn concert on Monday night.

A source told Mail Online: 'It's not just over for Justin and Selena, whatever happens they have a lot to talk about.

Scroll down to hear Justin refuse to confirm any split...

Time to talk: Selena Gomez arrived in New York on Saturday night with 'tentative plans' to meet up with Justin Bieber ahead of his Brooklyn show on Monday, she was seen leaving her New York hotel on Sunday morning

'Their schedules have been packed but Selena has made tentative plans to see Justin in New York before his Brooklyn concert, she hasn't decided if she'll attend yet, but she's keen to talk... and so is he.

'They're both being a bit cagey and stubborn but they're desperate to see one another.

'This isn't new for them, they often have a tumultuous relationship. We all expect them to work it out.'

Selena was in the city for a promotional visit to K-Mart in White Plains, nicely timed to coincide with Justin.

Further sources close to the Canadian singer have revealed that the 18-year-old is NOT involved with anyone else despite the fact that he stepped out with Hungarian fashion model Barbara Palvin, 19.

The moles, who spoke toÂ TMZ, also explained that Justin feels that he and Selena have broken up before many times and that this split is just another 'blip.'

They added that the pop juggernaut is not 'freaked out' because he believes there's a good chance they'll get back together.

And on Saturday, Justin refused to confirm the split when he phone into a radio show.

He said: 'I don't know what to say,' he said in an interview with Open House Party.

Talks? Bieber wants Gomez back and he's about to get the chance to persuade her

'I don't know what's going on in my life. To even assess that it doesn't make sense 'cause I have not made any comment.'

But he did chose to play a cover version of the song Justin Timberlake wrote after his split from Britney Spears, Cry Me A River, just a day after the 'news' broke.

The split came after Justin was apparently seen 'chatting up' models backstage at the Victoria's Secret show on Wednesday.

The Canadian singer was seen taking Palvin to see The Lion King on Broadway.

E! Online then reported that the couple have gone their separate ways.

According to a source they broke up about a week ago, and were last spotted together as long ago as October 20.

An insider said: 'Because of their crazy schedules, it was getting harder and harder to maintain a relationship.'

Amongst
 claims they split last week, Selena angrily posted a picture on her 
Twitter page showing Justin with his rumoured new squeeze in the 
background on Thursday.

The text the 20-year-old posted alongside it was a mysterious, '...'

To add even more spice to the story, it 
has emerged the fashion model criticised the Wizards of Waverly Place 
actress earlier this year.

In a webchat 11 months ago she offered to sing her fans a song of their choice, but added: 'I don't like Selena Gomez by the way...'

But it seems she was trying to trying to
 take back the insult, as when fans tweeted her about the video, she 
told them: 'I do like her as an actress! she is talented!:) I did that 
ustream a year ago. Just forget it.:).'

New friend: After reportedly 'trying to chat up' multiple models at the Victoria's Secret show  he ended up taking Barbara Palvin to see the Lion King

Game face: Justin didn't look like he was suffering from heartbreak as he performed in concert in New York on Friday

However she was not shy to post images of her and the star at the high profile fashion show, and next to one where she is in her dressing gown with him, she said: 'Okay sooo because u guys were askin for it! with @justinbieber! you were great tonight!'

She also posted an image where she is posing with Justin's manager Scooter Braun and director Alfredo Flores.

Additionally, she later wrote 'The Lion King,' with a heart symbol alongside it, however she was clearly referring to the 18-year-old hunk on Friday morning when she posted on Twitter: 'Hey everyone. please calm down. he is all yours!! :) please :).'

Despite all the speculation, the Believe star, who was seen appearing in concert in New York on Friday evening, has been keeping mysteriously quiet on the subject.

Nearing the end: Justin and Selena did not look very close when he visited her on set on August 29

Justin was spotted getting flirty with various Victoria's Secret models on Wednesday night after performing at the catwalk show.

But Selena seems to be moving fast too if her own online postings are anything to go by.

On Thursday night she tweeted a cosy 
snap of herself lying down next to British star Gregg Sulkin as they filmed until
 the early hours of the morning on location in Hollywood, where they are
 shooting their Wizards Of Waverly Place reunion movie.

She's got the look: Barbara seen on the catwalk of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show this week, left, and on the pink carpet, right

Telling tweet: Selena added fuel to the fire when she tweeted this photo of Justin with Barbara in the background

Moving on? Selena got tongues wagging when she posted this picture of her and co-star Gregg Sulkin

The news may be received well by fans
 of the Baby singer, who have been unpleasant towards Selena since they 
started dating in early 2011, frequently attacking her via the internet.

She
 has said in the past of the comments: 'It hurts, it really does. I 
don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. I've been best friends with him
 for a very long time.

'It does hurt my feelings a lot, but I try not to focus on it.'
