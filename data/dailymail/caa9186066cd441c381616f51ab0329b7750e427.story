Two years after his death, a remarkable twist of fate has meant a loving Navy father's message has finally reached his 10-year-old son.

Joseph Torrez passed away two years ago, aged 41, after succumbing to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, an incurable neurological disorder.

The rapidly-progressing terminal illness eats away at the brain - causing dementia, memory loss, anxiety and psychosis - and affects motor skills and physical movements.  

Rowan Torrez, now 10, received the postcard (pictured) in the mail at the weekend, almost exactly two years after his father's death

Rowan and his father Joseph play together when he was a toddler. The young boy was his father's pride and joy, his mother Julie Van Stone said

Prior to the onset of the deadly disease, he moved away from his son Rowan, 10, to Boston, to gain two Masters degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 9News reported.

And while studying or travelling home, he sent countless postcards to his only son reminding him how much he missed him.

Now, just days away from the two-year anniversary of his death, his son Rowan has received an incredible gift in the mail.

It was a postcard, dated June 10, 2007, which read: 'Hello from Pennsylvania. I love you, and I miss you so much. See you soon. Love, Daddy.'

It was a touching moment for Rowan, who remembers his father as a 'very good person' and a good father and, as he told the broadcaster, a fitting final goodbye.
