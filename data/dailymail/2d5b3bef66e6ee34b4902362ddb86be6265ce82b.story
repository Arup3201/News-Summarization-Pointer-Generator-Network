Bayern Munich are keen on Manchester United starlet Adnan Januzaj.

The European and Bundesliga champions face United at Old Trafford tomorrow in the Champions League quarter-final, first leg and have been monitoring the impact made by 19-year-old Januzaj since he broke into the first team last summer.

Paris St Germain made an offer for Januzaj early in the season which was rejected by United and they will maintain that stance should any other club attempt to lure away their brightest young star.

Raid: Bayern Munich believe they can tempt Manchester United's young star Adnan Januzaj to Bavaria

Bright young thing: Januzaj is highly regarded by United and they will be determined not to let him go at any cost

The Belgium-born midfielder signed a five-year contract at United in October as David Moyes underlined his belief that Januzaj is pivotal to his plans for a new era.

Bayern, who remain keen on a summer deal for Chelsea defender David Luiz, are scouting across the world for versatile attacking players who can succeed the likes of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery, who have both turned 30.

They have yet to make an offer for Januzaj but their interest is strong.

Getting ready: Januzaj could feature in United's Champions League quarter-final with Bayern over the next week

Summer target: Bayern also have Chelsea's David Luiz on their shortlist

Equally, United will not entertain bids as they look to show that, despite this season’s dramatic dip in results, they still have the power to hold onto their young stars and attract new ones.

The loss of Paul Pogba is still a sore point and the club want to ensure that scenario is not repeated.

Meanwhile, Ajax are among the clubs showing an interest in Manchester United right-back Marnick Vermijl. The 22-year-old Belgian is on loan at Dutch side NEC.

EVERTON JOIN QUEUE OF CLUBS INTERESTED IN FIRMINO

Everton are maintaining an interest in Hoffenheim midfielder Roberto Firmino despite the Brazilian agreeing a new contract.

Scouts watched the 22-year-old score in Saturday’s 3-3 draw with Bayern Munich and the playmaker again impressed with his all-round performance.

He has been watched by Inter Milan, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United and City this season and last week agreed a two-year extension to a contract that was due to run out in 2015.

He is valued at around £12million but Firmino has yet to be capped by Brazil and is yet to secure an EU passport, that could cause a problem for any subsequent work permit hearing.

Champions League contenders Everton are drawing up a list of targets as they look to strengthen in attack, midfield and at centre-back for next season.

BELGIAN STARLET FAES WATCHED BY MAN UNITED AND CHELSEA

Wout Faes, remember the name. The 15-year-old Belgium defender was watched closely by scouts from Chelsea and Manchester United last week as he played for Belgium U17s in the European U17 Championships in Scotland.

The spring-haired teenager, who has drawn comparisons to Chelsea’s David Luiz in appearance, turns 16 on Thursday and is another product of Anderlecht’s youth system.

His style and ability on the ball has got clubs discussing figures already and Anderlecht will be holding out for around £2million in compensation.

Another Anderlecht starlet Ismail Azzaoui is expected to complete a deal with Tottenham despite late interest from Liverpool in the 16-year-old winger.

SWANSEA AND NORWICH IN CHASE FOR POWELL

Swansea and Norwich want to sign Manchester United midfielder Nick Powell in a permanent deal this summer. Wigan are also keen to take the 20-year-old should they gain promotion after Powell scored his 12th goal of the season at the weekend.

However, manager David Moyes would prefer for Powell to go out on loan again for another season and this time to a Premier League club so the teams in contention may yet get their wish but only on a temporary basis.

DZEKO COULD LEAD REVAMPED INTER NEXT SEASON

Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko is emerging as the preferred option for Inter Milan ahead of Chelsea’s Fernando Torres.

Dzeko has scored 22 goals in 44 games for club and country this season and Inter are keen for him to spearhead their revamped squad for next season.

They have been keen on the 28-year-old for some time and his form has only cemented their view that he could be the man to help them challenge Juventus, Roma and Napoli.

No rush: City will be reluctant to let the Bosnian front man leave until they have found a replacement

City, however, are not in any rush to sell unless they find a suitable replacement. They would want close to £18m as they look to balance out any improvements of their own in the summer with a defensive midfielder and centre-back among their own priorities.

Dzeko is understood to be on less wages than Torres but that fee will be the sticking point for Inter as they look to add a top striker and five other signings.

LEEDS SQUAD COULD GO FOR NOTHING

There will be a lot of interest focused on Massimo Cellino’s appeal hearing today as he fights to buy Leeds United.

Cellino was disqualified as a potential owner by the Football League last week after being found guilty in an Italian court of failing to pay €388,500 of import tax on a yacht. The Italian businessman had agreed in February to buy 75 per cent of Leeds from the Bahrain-based investment bank Gulf Finance House.

In court: Massimo Cellino will attend an appeal hearing on Monday after the Football League disqualified him as a potential owner of Leeds United over unpaid taxes on a yacht

Representatives from the law firm Mishcon de Reya are to argue that Cellino is innocent under Italian law until an appeal against the import tax ruling is finalised.

Leeds playing staff received only 50 percent of their wages last week as the club struggled to cover debts without Cellino’s cash.

Should the financial situation deteriorate then Leeds will be wary of not being able to pay the players wages which is reputed to total around £18million a year.

If players go 14 days without any payment at all those players are able to leave on free transfers as happened at Rangers.
