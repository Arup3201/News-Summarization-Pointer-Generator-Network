David Cameron personally approved the decision to axe two of Theresa May’s senior advisers from the Tory candidates list, the Daily Mail can reveal.

Senior sources say the Prime Minister ‘signed off’ a recommendation from party chairman Grant Shapps to suspend the taxpayer-funded aides as prospective MPs.

The move was ostensibly to punish them for their refusal to take part in campaigning in the Rochester and Strood by-election, since they believed canvassing was a breach of Civil Service rules.

Last night the decision came under attack from former minister Sir Alan Duncan, who described the treatment of Nick Timothy and Stephen Parkinson as ‘Stalinist’. He added: ‘I can’t see that this is a proper way for a party to behave.’

The steely Home Secretary, who is expected to run for the leadership if the Tories lose the general election and Mr Cameron quits, is understood to be backing her aides.

The row is widely seen as the latest episode in a toxic feud between Downing Street and the Home Office, which has worsened since polls have shown Mrs May has become the activists’ favourite to succeed the Prime Minister.

Another of the Home Secretary’s advisers, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit over the summer in a row over extremism in schools.

Sir Alan, an international development minister until this summer’s reshuffle, said: ‘It is fundamentally unprincipled and unjust that the central power of a party is being used to destroy someone’s political prospects.

‘It’s almost Stalinist. If they don’t like what Nick Timothy does as a special adviser, they should sack him if they can justify it. Otherwise he has every right to put his name forward to be an MP.’

Mr Cameron’s most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, was dragged further into the row yesterday as Labour demanded to know what advice his office had given on campaigning by ministerial aides.

The official code of conduct for special advisers says that as public servants, they should not conduct canvassing in by-election campaigns and are required to resign their posts if they wish to do so. Previous advice from the Mr Cameron’s political private secretary, Laurence Mann, was that they could use their spare time to stuff envelopes or do ‘back-room’ work during a campaign.

But Tory sources insist that Sue Gray, the director of ethics and propriety at the Cabinet Office, approved a change in the rules to also allow telephone canvassing.

Other senior figures – including the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, and two of his aides who are running as MPs, Oliver Dowden and Laura Trott – are understood to have helped to call voters in Rochester.

Mr Timothy and Mr Parkinson decided to be ‘bloody awkward’ about taking part, one senior source claimed. ‘You were expected by the Prime Minister to pull your weight in this campaign and unlike everyone else they refused,’ the source said.

Labour’s Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Ashworth last night wrote to Sir Jeremy asking him to publish the advice he issued.

‘Many will suspect that personal political positioning is at the heart of this row, which in fact centres on proper use of taxpayers’ money,’ he wrote.

A Cabinet Office spokesman refused to discuss claims that Miss Gray failed seven times to agree to confirm in writing that advisers were allowed to do telephone canvassing.
