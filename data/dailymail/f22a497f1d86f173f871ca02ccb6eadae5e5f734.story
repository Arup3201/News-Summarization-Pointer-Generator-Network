Though the product is still in the design phase, its creators have already raised $211,000 on Indiegogo

A new 'smart' pepper spray promises to disable an attacker, take a picture of them and instantly send it to law enforcement - all with the push of a single button.  

The Defender, which hangs on a keychain, combines high-strength pepper spray, a flashlight and a camera that links users' cell phones via Bluetooth, Ozy.com reports.

When the button is pressed, a stream of high-strength spray hits the assailant, while at the same time a siren sounds to attack attention and the camera snaps a shot of their face.   

Personal protection: The Defender features a camera, flashlight, siren and pepper spray all in one device

The Defender then sends the photo and your GPS location 
to a '24/7 monitoring service' that contacts local 911 
centers and alerts them to distress.

Users control the information shared
 from within the app included a user profile with photo, medical 
conditions, and any relevant safety concerns that users will want to 
share with authorities.

Though the product is still in 
the design phase, its creators have already raised $211,000 on Indiegogo.

The
 Defender also has an oscillating flash with a siren and speaker to draw
 attention and reach out to anyone in the immediate vicinity. The small
 device will work with iOS and Android, and just needs a Wi-Fi or 
cellular signal to connect.

Second nature: The Defender's designers hope that users will incorporate the device into their daily routine, carrying it along with their keys and phone

Instant response: The photo is immediately sent to agents who are constantly monitoring the system

The advertisement says that the device can be used for 'safety or medical attention', and claims that it will have 'the highest concentration of pepper spray available to law 
enforcement'.

The Indiegogo offer sells the Defender for 
$159, which includes one year of monitoring - and designers say that the public can expect the first products in December, just in time for the holidays.

Marketing Director of Pangaea Services, Inc., Ryan McManus, stated, 'The
 Defender will change the way we think about personal safety. We 
unconsciously ensure our safety every day and we never think twice about
 locking our doors or snapping a seat belt in-place.'

'The Defender on 
your key chain provides a revolutionary step forward by empowering the 
user. Whether for yourself or someone you care about, The Defender just 
makes sense.'
