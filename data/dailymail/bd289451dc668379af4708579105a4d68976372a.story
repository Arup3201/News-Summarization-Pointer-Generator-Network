Former TVAM presenter Mike Morris died after NHS staff failed to spot warning signs following bladder cancer surgery, an inquest has heard.

Mr Morris, who made his name alongside Lorraine Kelly and Anne Diamond on the breakfast show, was only 66 when he died two years ago. 

He had been fully expected to recover from an operation at East Surrey Hospital, to correct bleeding following bladder cancer surgery.

But an inquest in Surrey heard that a succession of failures by doctors, over many hours, led to a cardiac arrest in the early hours of the morning.

Medical witnesses told the coroner how his condition had deteriorated with no action taken to move him from a general ward to a high dependency unit.

Coroner Karen Henderson said: 'Mr Morris died from complications of necessary surgery when post operative deterioration in his condition was not recognised and consequently went un-treated.'

His death had been completely unexpected and no members of his family were present when he died in early hours of the morning at the Redhill hospital in October 2012.

Morris, who got a world exclusive interview with Nelson Mandela on his release from jail, had undergone surgery a week earlier but had developed bleeding in his urine and been re-admitted for surgery to stem significant blood loss.

He was given 5 units of blood and placed on a ward to recover. 

An early warning system which monitors vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, breathing and heart rate, soon showed that Morris needed more intensive help than was available on the ward.

But a succession of nurses and doctors failed to act on the warning signs, the inquest was told.

Mr Morris went into cardiac arrest at around 6am and died at 7.10am.

Gregory Armon-Jones, who is married to Mr Morris's daughter, Helen, said the family was shocked by his diagnosis but they had taken heart from the fact his cancer was a low grade and could be easily treated.

He said: 'He had various health problems, including heart problems. He also had bladder cancer but, as far as we were concerned, this was under control.' 

He said that the news of his death shocked the family.

Mr Armon-Jones, said: 'He was a larger than life character.

'You only have to watch some of the old videos of him presenting to see that. He had separated from my mother-in-law and lived on his own.

'His whole life revolved around his family, especially his two daughters Helen and Sarah, and his grandchildren.

'One of the reasons myself and Helen moved to Hersham in Surrey was to be closer to him.

Dr Des Holden, medical director at Surrey & Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'The review shows aspects of Mr Morris' care after his emergency surgery were below that which he and his family were entitled to expect.

'The trust has apologised to Mr Morris' family and has introduced a range of measures to improve the post-operative care for high risk patients.

'The capacity in both the Intensive Care Unit and the High Dependency Unit have been increased to cope with demand and changes have been made to the way the ICU and outreach teams are staffed and the work patterns within the teams.'

Mr Holden said no members of staff had been disciplined as 'our investigation showed everyone involved in Mr Morris's care was trying to do their best for him.'

Famous for his distinctive moustache, Morris joined TV-am as a sports presenter, eventually becoming the host of Good Morning Britain in 1987. He remained with TV-am until 1992.

During his stint as main weekday anchor, he presented alongside Anne Diamond, Kathy Rochford, Kathryn Holloway, Kathy Tayler, Linda Mitchell, Maya Even and Lorraine Kelly.
