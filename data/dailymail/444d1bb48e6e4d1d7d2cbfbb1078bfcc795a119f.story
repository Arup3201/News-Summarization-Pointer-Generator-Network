Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling has shelved contract talks until the end of the season.

The development casts further doubt over the England international’s long-term future at Anfield.

Sterling has been locked in talks over a contract extension for several months but the 20-year-old has told club officials he wants to focus on the remainder of Liverpool’s Premier League season and on winning the FA Cup.

The news will be met with anxiety by club chiefs, who are desperate to secure Sterling on a long-term deal and the next round of talks, when they recommence in the summer, will be critical, with his existing £35,000-per-week deal expiring in 2017.

Given Sterling’s status as one of Europe’s top emerging talents, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are watching on closely.

Likewise, Premier League clubs will also enter the race if it becomes clear Sterling is available.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers claims Sterling has been offered an ‘incredible deal’ — which is understood to be close to £100,000-per-week.

Rodgers has previously insisted Sterling is close to putting pen to paper, but as it stands there is no agreement.

The Anfield boss has called the Jamaican-born forward the best young player in Europe and is under increasing pressure to ensure the club keep their jewel in the crown. Whether Liverpool finish in the top four is likely to be a factor in Sterling’s decision.
