John Terry will stay at Chelsea after Jose Mourinho confirmed he will sign a one-year extension at the end of the season.

Terry, 34, who most recently signed a one-year contract extension back in May 2014, is one of only three players, alongside Branislav Ivanovic and Eden Hazard, to have started all of his side's league games this term.

And he is set to be rewarded for his fine form, producing stellar performance after performance, with the Blues currently sitting seven points clear at the top of the Premier League.

Terry has enjoyed a brilliant season and hopes to continue his career at Stamford Bridge for another year

Debut: Aston Villa (H), October 28 1998

Appearances: 656

Honours: Three Premier League titles, Five FA Cups, Two League Cups, Two Community Shields, One Champions League, One Europa League 

'John accepted that we go year-after-year, with a smile,' said Mourinho. 'He accepted the challenge and he won it and he is winning the challenge and the right to get one more year.

'That is what the club wants, that’s what John wants and that is going to happen.’

The news means Terry's Chelsea career will prolong into an 18th season, with both parties keen on getting the deal over the line.

The centre-half accepts Chelsea’s policy of awarding 12-month extensions to players over 30, but wants to remain at Stamford Bridge despite that. 

Terry, the former England captain, made his first-team debut for the club back in October 1998 against Aston Villa in the League Cup, and has since gone on to make another 655 appearances.

He is also the club's most successful captain of all time, leading the club to three Premier League titles,  four FA Cups, two League Cups and a Champions League success.

Elsewhere, Chelsea recently tied  Hazard down to a five-and-half-year contract extension, news which Terry described as 'the most important for the club'.

Mourinho added that he does not expect to sign a new contract himself, although he ruled out the possibility of leaving Stamford Bridge in the near future.

‘I have two more years of my contract,' he said. 'I am not waiting for offers, I am not going to give any space for speculation or for interest from other clubs. I want to stay, I don’t want to go.

‘I don’t need an new contract right now. It is a non-story because I said from the beginning that I will stay while Mr Abramovich wants me to stay.’

Speaking at his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea's game against Burnley on Saturday, Mourinho also raised concerns over the treatment Hazard received in the Champions League last-16 first-leg tie against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night, as he was fouled a record-breaking nine times.

He said: 'Hazard is a lucky boy not to be injured. During the game I was aware of the number of fouls, but I was aware that every time he had the ball he was surrounded and fouled.

'The dimension on the fouls, some of them were really dangerous. He is a lucky kid - he is fair and honest, he deserves to be honest. 

'He deserves that luck, the kind he got at Stoke for example. He is honest, he is loyal, he does not provoke opponents and does not start doing tricks to provoke people and create emotional reactions. 

'In this moment the fouls are over the line. I am proud of him by being honest on the pitch and I leave it with the authorities to do something.'
